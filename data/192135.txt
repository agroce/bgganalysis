GAME: Too Many Bones
RANK: 333
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Superb quality components and a joy to play with, although some icons are absolutely miniscule and sometimes very hard to distinguish.  We did plenty of squinting throughout the game.

The encounter stories are engaging and very well written.

Some house-ruling needed as the rules didn't cover a couple of issues that arose.

The battle board works but as a 4x4 grid is a bit generic and dull.

Our first game was 3-player and took 1 hour to set up and go through the rules and 4.5 hours to play.

Got to play it at a con. I surprisingly enjoyed this game, even though games like this one are not normally my sort of thing. Beautiful artwork & components (love how durable they seem to be!), fun characters with exciting powers, and a co-op that it is relatively difficult for someone to alpha game. I also like that while there is a significant luck element due to dice, there are both ways to mitigate rolls (some loot) and something to do with bad rolls (backup powers). A few things keep it from being a ten: the rules are unnecessarily finnicky (definitely not a streamlined, elegant game) and storyline, while not bad, was a little bit on the dry side, which made it hard to care about what happened. That said, I'd be happy to play this game again, and I do think it's well-deserving of the praise it has received.

RATING: 7
It was a cool game, with fun dice and leveling mechanisms, but ultimately is not a game I would purchase.  A bit overwrought and overly complex, and the graphic design is a messy bleed of colors.  Thankfully we had someone to teach it and "run" the game - I like complex fantasy grinds but this one was more than I could learn even by the end of the game.  I liked the treasure chest opening mini-game.

Kickstarted. Co-op dice-building fantasy adventure. This looks like it will be really interesting. The components looks like they will be of supremely high quality. I actually don't think I own anything quite so premium. This game looks droolworthy...

I love the quality of the components for this game, it just feels solid and durable. The game itself is very challenging, albeit downright disastrous if you don't get your rolls going for you. So far, I have not won a single game playing solo but have enjoyed the intricacies involved in optimizing your character.

:thumbsup: There is an enormous amount of variability and unpredictability with the different Gearlocs, Tyrants, baddies, and encounters.
:thumbsup: The component quality is superb and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the game, down to the added artistic details.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The flavor text on many of the encounter cards can become redundant over time.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The rules take a long time to learn with a somewhat confusing rulebook and innumerable special cases.

:thumbsdown: Certain battles are impossible to win, and any attempt to complete them can feel like a complete waste of time.
:thumbsdown: Some elements and mini-games are not enjoyable and take away from the experience, rather than enhancing it.

RATING: 7
An adventure game in which character development is handled by adding dice from a pool specific to each character. The characters do play very differently.  The clichéd format of fighting through encounters with minions to the Big Boss is enlivened by a few that aren't skirmishes and by consequences of past encounters resurfacing. The tactical combat at the heart of the game is handled simply, while allowing the players decent options.  The setting is pretty generic fantasy. It's one of the more enjoyable games of this kind.

I played with the expansions; the amount of stuff and its production quality was impressive. However, the tiny icons and numbers on the chips strained these ageing eyes.  The cutesy artwork didn't appeal so much.  The rules and player aids could use a re-draft.

RATING: 9
It's an excellent game. Thankfully and unlike so many of its dice-heavy peers, Too Many Bones (TMB) requires strategy as you progress through the scenario and some tactical play in the individual battles. You are given a definite sense that you play the game (as opposed to the dice playing you) and you feel engaged for the entire time as you play. At least compared to other dungeon crawlers I've played, TMB feels akin to a video game RPG with additional room to get even closer with future content (e.g., a campaign mode).

The gearloc progression along with TMB's loot system provides enough depth for the length that TMB plays. Each gearloc can be played many times before you feel like you've exhausted the various progression paths. The baddies are as good as they were in Hoplomachus, and only add to the replayability. If you solo, you can play a single gearloc by using a specific encounter deck or play as two gearlocs. There's lots of game in the box for each supported play count.

With the help of Ricky Royal's video and BGG player aids, I was able to pick up and play the game pretty quickly. But I own all the Hoplomachus games. The combat is very similar to Hoplomachus and, therefore, I was familiar with a good deal of the terminology. If you aren't familiar with Hoplomachus, expect the first game to take a considerable time and effort (so much that it may be a frustrating experience). You'll want to have a dedicated group (solo through 4 players) willing to play this game about a dozen times.

The most glaring negative in this game is shared with a number of games: poorly organized rule book and unclear player aids. The rule set is a step up in complexity from individual Hoplomachus games, but is similar in total to the entirety of Hoplomachus: TLC and RoR with a few additional encounter rules thrown in. The Hoplo series had its own issues with rule book clarity, but the increase in complexity, unfortunately, has exacerbated the lack of organization in some of the materials. I expect, like Gloomhaven, this will be vastly improved by the revised materials being released later in the summer of 2017.

A secondary quibble is similar to my issue with Hoplomachus: a lot of really good content is behind a fairly steep paywall. With respect to TMB, the extra characters are the most appealing to me, and the adventure mat adds enough that it should have been included in the base game (it assists in giving that RPG/adventure feel). TMB is a great production, but I would have accepted a few downgrades in component quality to get the entire package at a more attractive price had that option been present.

I was asked by the publisher (who incidentally rates the game a 10) for my thoughts on the game so I thought I'd include them here: 

(He asked if I had a bad experience getting the game or another reason to dislike it...) 

"Not at all. I just really, really disliked the game.

I found the barrier to entry too high for what it was - and the amount of options from minute one somewhat overwhelming. I have also recently played Gloomhaven A LOT and think it does everything this was trying to do 1000 times better. The tactical combat in Bones was boring and dicey, compared to the awesome puzzle that every round of Gloomhaven presents. So no problems with the delivery of the game and the production is astounding! I just didn't like anything about the game."

This game is fantastic!  I play it mostly solo with 2 characters and the depth of strategy is great for me.  There are certainly times when the dice won't go in your favor but there are almost always ways to mitigate that issue.  Love it and will always play, and components are the best I have ever seen in a game.

Dungeon crawler with very minimalistic map (4x4 squares). The combat is dull and repetitive and the game has to many fiddly rules for unimportant details. A typical kickstarter -> a game that would have benefitted immensly from an editor and some game development.

Great game !! Very fun once you get the hang of things .

Rulesbook isn't the clearest and does not have a ton of examples.  Watch the videos available on Chip Theory Games YouTube channel before playing and then again after you have completed your first session.  It will clarify a ton of things for you.

The game components are of extremely high quality.  I can't think of many games with better quality components .

Overall, this a very fun game with unique mechanics, super high quality production and game components and a very nice art style.

It's quite an involved game and the depth and breadth makes we want to play more. I still haven't wrapped my head around the strategies (or the fact that there are so many options you won't use each game), but this game screams potential. (and it's hard not to rate expensive games highly - a bit of a sunk cost effect!) Plus it's a tactile joy to play.

Note: Component upgrade pack ordered to make 1st edition match 2nd edition

Quite a unique and interesting game! The tactile feel of the components is wonderful and the way that character progression and leveling is handled has a great feel. Each character will get more powerful throughout an adventure, by customizing dice and increasing stats. The combat gameplay can be quite challenging, and the layout of the battle mat adds for some nice strategic decisions for movement, etc. The enemies can be nasty and we have found ourselves barely surviving battles in some instances. Also, the inclusion of some mini-games (Darts and Lockpicking) add a fun flavor to this game that is unique. Also, the variety of encounters and interesting objectives is very much appreciated. I also really appreciate that elements of the combat are abstracted out (range, line of sight), just allowing a purer experience.

There are two negatives to the game for me. One is the current rule ambiguity. The rules really aren’t that complicated at all, but there are some very key concepts (what is a hit, what is an attack, etc.) that aren’t very explicitily called out in the rulebook. There are 180+ rule postings on the BGG forums within a couple of weeks of the game being shipped, showing that the rules aren’t well written. Again, I like the game enough to read the forums and find answers, but you will often find yourself pausing the game to google something while playing early on. The second negative is just a consequence of luck based combat, which is the fact that sometimes you can just lose a battle before even having a chance. You rolled a poor initiative and the 3 enemies that went before you hit you for 6 damage plus put a poison 2 on you? Well you died before you even got to roll any dice! That can feel very random and frustrating. However, what goes along with that is epic rolls where you only have one HP left and the enemy rolls 3 missed, allowing you to land the killing blow on your turn! The problem is that early failures that feel sort of random (low initiative rolled, etc.) can basically set you back for the whole adventure in some cases. Also, I should point out that there are a few typos on cards, etc. that the publisher is working to correct.

So in the end I really like this game. I can acknowledge its flaws and appreciate the fun contained in this box. It feels good to play this game, the custom skill dice and characterize customization feels wonderful, the combat is very clever and well done, and the variety of encounters and enemies is great. You really want to play the same character multiple times to learn how they are played and explore their abilities. This is a great sign, as it shows that each character has depth and really reminds me of playing computer RPGs like WoW and trying different skill trees. While it isn’t a perfect 10 for me personally, it is a wonderful game that I would always rather play over a traditional dungeon crawler/dice chucker. A big plus is that my wife really enjoys it as well!

P.S. Premium Health chips and add-on characters are worth it!

7 Plays in and it is exactly what I hoped it to be! This game is heavy but really clever and one of the best two-player games I've played so far! The Characters feeel very different and the game itself is extremely challenging and a tornado of dice chucking awesomeness. 

Update: After 12 plays I like this game even better than Gloomhaven - can't wait for the announced expansion and hope that CTG will support this system forever!

Update 2: Still love it! It has some flaws though - like unwinnable battles due to low initiative rolls, especially with two players. Gendricks is practically unbeatable at this player count due to hardy being OP, but the rest of the game remains superb. We are now able to play the longest adventures in two and a half hours and we enjoy those much more than the shorter ones. Need Undertow badly!

Lovely production, and each character is unique and has a variety of routes you can take, and a nice variety of bosses (who alter the mix of baddies you'll face). Bit of pick your path with the encounter cards. All of this meant I was expecting to love this.

Didn't :(

why? Characters and minions as stacks of chips didn't do it for me. My character sheet as a bunch of dice all with lots of icons didn't do it for me - I just lost the narrative and story and it all came down to rolling dice.

Maybe with more plays something will click and it will shine.

Theme of cute little gearlocks didn't do anything for me either, maybe that is the heart of the problem, just don't like the theme enough to get pulled in, but as a tactical puzzle not bad.

Enjoyed my first solo play immensely!
I can see already how incredible the replayability will be with this game - a different tyrant to face each game (each having a different combination of enemies to fight during your adventure), about three times the number of encounter cards available than will be seen in even the longest multiplayer game, seven characters to choose from (with expansions), each having different "level up" strategies to pursue... Just awesome!
The game components are flippin' PREMIUM. PVC cards and player aids?! Just WOW! Not to mention that all of the "boards"/playmats are thick neoprene, the dice feel great (and there are TONS of them), the chips feel awesome (even the basic health chips are of great quality!), and there is an excellent box insert that effectively stores and organizes everything. =]=]=]
I'm waiting until I've given it some more plays before rating it, but I highly suspect this will be a "10" in my book.
So much fun, and meaningful choices galore!

Update after 4 plays:
Yep! I'm giving this a "10" rating. =]
It took me four games to finally beat Nom with Patches solo, but every bit of it was lovely!

I was very interested in this game and looking forward to playing this thing.

I didn't play a full campaign but I've seen enough to know that this isn't for me.
The components are well done. The cheatsheets could have been better.

The battle is pretty... I don't know... Somehow not that interesting.
Yes I know that it gets better the stronger you char becomes but the "tactical movement" on this small battleboard is really not appealing to me. It tries to be more than it can deliver imo.

C'est un peu difficile de commencer, mais après 4 partie semi-complete en solo, j'arrive à comprendre le puzzle. Parce que ce jeu, c'est un puzzle. Il faut jouer de stratégie plus que de tactique et jouer les probabilités. Les "Back-up plans" qui deviennent disponible seulement lorsqu'on "rate" un jet de dés sont tellement important que l'on se retrouve souvent à souhaiter de rater son lancé.

J'aime bien et c'est très tactile avec les jeton de poker.

Excellent game but first version's rulebook was hard to decipher: it took me initially a few games and hours of forum-browsing to get things correct. But now it plays really smoothly. I've tried all player counts (1, 2, 3 and 4) and they have all been enjoyable. I'd say toughest was 2 player, 4 was the easiest. Solo is fun: you have solo-specific adventure cards. I think the add-on characters are really cool and bring a lot of variety in game play to the game. I love how each Gear-lock feels different. It has been a blast with everyone I've played with (except the messy first play since I hadn't gotten the rules correct...). Really excited about Undertow and the campaign/tyran upcoming extensions.

Excellent adventure game.  Character development is really well done.  Characters have very different skills and play quite differently, which makes for a lot of replayability.

Still, it is a fun, tactical game.  Components are top-notch!

Excellent asymmetry and a feel-good skill system that increases pretty quickly. Unfortunately the combat is a little bland and the abstract board seems unnecessary. I also do not appreciate how your skills are typically one time uses and you can whiff. Have a suspicion that even though characters are pretty diverse, each will typically be built the same way upon repeated plays offering little variance within a character.

Why I got rid of it:  for me the great part of the game was leveling up and then using your dice.  Problem is the game has some tactical map without much tactical depth and so meaningless story cards that just slow things down.  You spend too long messing with the dull parts of the game.

 Also too many of the dice were one time use.  I spent a while to get it and then in one role it is done.  I may play a whole game and use that die 2-3 times only.

The game has it charms but other coops ar more for to me.

Have played 4 times so far. Really satisfying to upgrade your character and gain skills. It is a lot to take in, but worth the effort. My only downside would be that the first 3 encounters are the exact same every game (I would be okay if there were different encounters that were functionally the same but with different flavor text). Another gripe would be that sometimes you just die before you even get a turn to do anything. It does not happen often, but it happens and that is just the way it goes sometimes.

Love this game.   It's been a joy to play, even though I usually suck at rolling dice!.  

It's been fun to play this with my 11yo Son, and introduce to some of my gaming friends.   Even friends that aren't into heavy games are asking me when we can play it again.

Love the depth and how immersive it is.   Before long a couple of hours have passed, and you don't even realize it.

I love the variety you get with the characters in this game. Each one is unique and satisfying to play. The game is challenging and engaging. Players have to work together to figure out the best way to stay alive and beat the evil baddies but you're not always fighting. Sometimes you're just playing a game of darts or throwing bombs at barrels. The components in this game are the best I have ever seen in any board game. The support from the developers is unmatched by any other company. If you love dice games and are looking for a great RPG experience, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.

This game is excellent in the depth, re-playability, and quality of the components. The game comes with 4 characters, but those characters have different branches of abilities to choose from. If you have played any type of RPG before, video games like Skyrim and WOW included, then the choices and skill trees will likely feel familiar to you. I have played about 10 games so far with 2-4 players, and the 5 different people I've played with have all enjoyed the game and been ready to play again at a later date.  I highly recommend this game, and will say that people who have previous RPG experience (again, video games included) will understand this game quicker. Note: My father-in-law loves this game and has no previous RPG experience. I will also note that this game is appropriate for all ages (important for me as a Dad)...think like Lord of the Rings. Dangerous looking bad guys, but no profanity or scantily clad females.

One of the nicest cooperative games available.
Works perfectly solo.
Not much as a puzzle as other games of the genre.
Unbelievable component quality.

The three special scenarios at the beginning of every adventure are a bit repetitive.
While the rulebook is ok, a lot of stuff happening on the dice, cards and baddies is not explained and leaves lots of questions.

Like Japanese food, I tend to like the idea of traditional RPG’s more than I actually enjoy the experience itself.  And while not technically an RPG, I think TMB’s moniker of “dice-builder RPG” really fits.  Kind of.  Somewhat surprisingly, TMB is really more evocative of an early MMORPG, like a throwback version of vanilla WoW, albeit re-incarnated as a table-top hybrid.  

Instead of a computer algorithm acting as your RNG, you’re doing it old school with dice.  Tons of them.  Very neatly fitting into these clever skill trees that are cut into your neoprene character mats.  And, lest I forget to mention the best part, you get to go "questing" while leveling up until you meet the boss.  So awesome. 

Now, I typically prefer emergent, low luck, strategy games with a low complexity to high depth ratio.  My “perfect” board game is the Splotter title [Thing=111341][/Thing].  But this game so totally scratches a different, and very satisfying, itch.  I love it.

This seems to really shine as a solo game. I played once with four players and it was quite a bit longer (as expected) and more difficult. This was likely due to the other players being new and still figuring out the game / their characters.

As a solo game though, I've really taken a liking to it. Fills a sweet spot for length that I've been missing in my solo gaming.

RATING: 6
A reasonably good diversion the way Sentinels is for me, though I like Sentinels better. I thought the combat decisions were fairly obvious. Some enemies are easier to one-shot than others; some you can only attack on every other turn. So you attack the guys you can attack most effectively this turn. Ostensibly, you're tempted to use the bones you roll (i.e., a 1) to build up for a super power, but I didn't feel the need for that. Now, I did play with training wheels on whereby all the enemies had their stats reduced by 1, so maybe those decisions get more interesting. 

As to upgrading, seemed fairly obvious that you want to upgrade both a) the number of dice you have and b) the number of dice you're allowed to roll each turn. I mean, not much of choice to over-pursue one over the other. But the different dice classes are fun and I'm glad I took it for a spin via the free Windows app.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very fun game. There is far too much luck for my taste and the difficulty spike between the normal fights and the boss is way too high, so we ended up using some house rules to help it a bit. Overall, I still love the game. The mechanics are a lot of fun and the components are incredible!

A hack-n-slash RPG campaign in a box.  Too Many Bones is a surprisingly deep strategic game about chucking fistfuls of dice.

It's really, really good.  See my written review for more: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1793173/hack-and-slash-rpg-box

Like Mechs vs. Minions, perhaps one of my biggest complaints is the excessive box size.  I've confirmed that everything in the base game, PLUS an expansion character, can fit into a Ticket to Ride sized box.  I'm fairly sure I could fit the contents of the game, including all currently available expansions, into three of the expansion character sized boxes.

RATING: 9.5
[u]The Good[/u]:
- The major systems used (the characters, the Tyrants, the pool of baddies, the different encounters) randomize well together to make for a Highly Replayable framework. As these systems are (hopefully) filled out with the coming expansions, replayability is going to skyrocket.
- Great combination of RPG-like Character Progression and Arcade-like, Fast Paced Combat.
- A Major Focus on a satisfying End Game, with a Decision-packed and Addicting Mid Game.
- Smart design includes a system that turns the failure result on your dice (the very worst thing about dice-chucking: that failure not due to skill but to luck) into something positive, which keeps the moral of the players high even when things aren't going as planned.
- The tactile side of this game is off the charts.

[u]The Bad[/u]:
- The options available to the players between battles (during the Recovery Phase and possibly outside of it) could be more interesting.
- Some Skill Dice are plainly better than others, so that you have less incentive to branch out into all of the ~16 different ones available to your Gearloc, but instead you will find yourself using the same core few more often than not.
- You can lose your Gearloc before you get to take your turn, which isn't the end of the world, as a failed encounter won't end your run -- but it's a buzzkill, and I think the game would've been better if this had been ironed out of it.

[u]The Bottom Line[/u]: Make no mistake -- you are paying up for the components, which are of the highest quality, and should your copy have the slightest blemish, CTG is known to quickly remedy that situation. But in this base game and the few extra characters, they have laid quite an impressive foundation for what looks to become one hell of a game series -- if you find the combat interesting.

Watch some gameplay vids of the combat; if that side of the game looks fun, then this substantial investment will come through for you in a big way.

All in all, my new favorite board game. Looking forward to how it evolves over the next few years.

RATING: 7.5
More complex & meaty than the Hoplo series. Has the added benefit of a better clicking theme.
This game is difficult though & rewards careful & weighted decisions. The Luck of the Draw as well as the dice rolling make me wonder about the unfaireness & the diminished experience that you might get out of it after spending significant time building your strategy & advancing through the (Limited) storyline. It seems though that there are enough ways to mitigate the luck to keep it interesting at least at medium difficulty level.

RATING: 8.5
The rules took a while to sink in, but once I got going the game really isn't that difficult. The difficulty is not in the rules but in mastering your character, 

I love the exploration element of the game where you build up your character, The choices on the cards are interesting and each play will be very different. It's simple yet very effective. The battles themselves are very fun. I like the tactical movement, dexterity system and especially the character abilities.

RATING: 10
Amazing components and quality making this game pleasant to touch and handle.  The premium chips are totally worth the $25 as the standard (although acceptable) can wobble and just feel out of place compared to the baddies, Gearlocs, etc.   

Had an issues where my box came with two Tantrum mats and missing Patches's mat.  Chip Theory took care of this no questions asked!  You get what you pay for!  Quality and Service! 

On the game play:  Difficult and with quite a learning curve.  But that is the magic for me!  Each Gearloc is a puzzle verse each tyrant.  Each Gearloc combo; 2 person, 3 person, 4 person versus each tyrant is different and each with a unique challenge and strategy.  Different modes will help mitigate frustrations with difficulty.  Some times the baddie queue has you defeated before you begin.  But that's RNG for you... make the best plans and hope your roll well!

Good luck in Daelore.... You'll need it!

Polished and beautiful battle-centric RPG.  A lot to keep in mind so it's not the most suitable for casual play groups, but eventually one can get the hang of it.

Could have richer story elements with more meaningful choices in this direction, as the encounter cards are rather random and brief.

Also, because of the randomness, I would need a few more plays to better understand the "fairness" of the cards, baddies, and skill v. stat use frequency in the current system especially when there are no consolation prizes, but if you are KO'ed you can still at least continue.  This may result in a snowball effect where if you get good encounters your first days after the initial few, it would be hard for you to lose future encounters; vice versa, if you get terrible encounters your first days, it might be hard to win future encounters.

Edit - Finally got a game in, dame sweet game.  Most of the comments about this game have been accurate, the positive and the subjectively potentially negative, you can watch videos to see this, and/or play the free PC game, etc to try to judge if the positives will outweigh those potential negs for you (they do for me, it can be long and tough to win, and even some bad rolls and losing just makes you want to set it up and try again, doesn't hurt that it's fun!), and you can also read this review, it is not my review, but I am linking it here because it was so detailed and well done, and I agree with most of it   https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1851553

If you want a unique D&D type game where the character upgrades are really well done and right at the forefront, loot, a story arc with ramping difficulty, and also packs in many tough strategic and tactical decisions regarding battle resolution, make sure you take a good look at this one, really well done overall and can't wait to see what they do with the campaign!  (it is essentially a campaign now, but they are taking it to the next level! Still really hoping for a stronger story line that can be affected in some ways and more non-battle activities)

----

Initial thoughts after watching many videos, reading rules etc.  

Hoping for more variety in Encounters especially the first 3 (edit - coming in Campaign!) but also others as well. More mini-games that are part of the story and affect the story would be sweet too (I know some don't like them due to added time, time will hopefully be addressed...) 

It's also a little light on the RPG, especially a significant developing story that can be interacted with and affected, extra activities outside of encounters, etc (really the character advancement is the main focus here, admittedly one of the best parts and extremely well done here).  These combined are the weakest point here IMO, and will HOPEFULLY be addressed in the coming Campaign! (Okay it's no KDM, Gloomhaven or Folklore: Aff but it could be a little closer than it is...like how about choices affecting the future/future choices, gaining gold to buy from some select items in town, more elaborate World Map that gives choices, Towns to visit rumors amuck, etc, add your ideas here:!!! https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1828782/upcoming-campaign-wishlist-please-add) 

These aspects bumped up would really elevate an already excellent game to the next level. Another addition I think would be welcomed by many is to cut the current length in half.  Have campaigns consist of many 2 hour sessions linked together, so approx 4 battles, then a rest/save point for those who would like to stop at that point.

This is quite simply an amazing game to play! It is the most well-made and constructed game from the components all the way to the game play. It does run rather long so you better plan for a good chunk of your day if you want to play it without being rushed. It is complex and the learning curve is a little long but the rule book is sufficient and they include icons in the rules that direct you to YouTube where you'll find videos explaining the game, how to play each character, etc. Overall, definitely a 10 out of 10 from me!

After a very long play, I ended up liking this game way more than I did at the beginning.  I still need to play some more, but we will see if I get the opportunity.

This is a big game, and I think it might be a bit too big.  It's a classic KS where they threw in everything and the kitchen sink, there is even a mini dice game for lockpiking.  

As a result, there is a lot of game here.  But for my tastes, I think I would have preferred a more streamlined design that played in half the time.  I really appreciate this design and the love that went into it though!

Kickstarted and glad I did. The game is not cheap, but these guys just go above and beyond when it comes to the production of their games. Every aspect of the game oozes with quality. Oozes!

First off, there's a bit of a learning curve here. Each character is different with their own dice. That means the first time playing might be a little rough for some. Once you get the hang of it though, there's a fun game here. It's a unique take on building up a character and going on a difficult adventure. Looking forward to playing again which is a very good sign!

For starters the production quality of this game is fantastic. I really enjoyed how you can develop your character through skill paths.

RATING: 6.5
After one play, eh, it's ok. Overall, I find TMB much less innovative than e.g. Assault on Doomrock (that game's flaws notwithstanding), and the theme feels lifeless to me. IMHO there's not too much special to distinguish TMB, especially narratively. The thin narrative framework was pretty unsatisfying; the language was amateurish in places and idiosyncratic (like the rest of the theme). The story choices were reasonably interesting, but pretty narrow in their differences. To be fair, there is some depth that we didn't observe in this one play, with new encounters getting shuffled in based on story choices, so maybe that would've altered the experience in interesting ways. But I don't think the underlying system really supports a strong story-driven experience--it's ultimately little more than a hook for a bunch of combat encounters. In this area especially, I wanted more.

Some positives: failed rolls = bones = a means for powering alternative abilities as consolation; the effects on skill dice are heterogeneous, so adding a new die generally provides more than one type of effect; dexterity is used for several types of things, making for interesting tradeoffs; separation between attack and defense dice allows for choice in how many of which type of dice to roll; the point system for increasing difficulty and style of baddie encounters works nicely; interesting balance mechanism for Trove Loot, where better items are harder to unlock (though unlocking is a strangely convoluted mechanism); baddies had interesting combinations of abilities and parameterized actions.

While the game itself is pretty straightforward, it takes some time to get used to all the different ways dice are used in this game. Note, tracking player/baddie health via chips is fine, sorta cool, but more a gimmick than any kind of mechanical innovation. The default plastic health chips are very cheap and don't stack neatly, though I wouldn't recommend buying the premium chips. There's something marginally interesting about using stacks of chips to represent actors on a map, but the game doesn't really do anything with that potential. For example, I'd like to see a baddie's stack used as a queue to trigger special AI actions as it's depleted. Oh well.

The game isn't bad and has some nice mechanical elements but it really doesn't connect with me, not with the components (which I find inferior to standard cardboard in most cases), nor in theme. I find the voice of the game to be derivative and uninteresting, so that reflects heavily on the experience for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pros: 
- Tremendous replayability 
- Each character (Gearloc) is unique and plays very differently from the next
- Component quality is some of the best in any board game I've ever owned
- Excellent solo play
- Combat strategy and character build strategy are deep, but not overly complex or laborious
- Character progression is fast. Every battle you win, your characters are getting training points and loot to increase their stats and unlock new abilities
- Even when you roll "badly" there are ways to harness the roll to your benefit (so much so that sometimes you're actually *hoping* to roll "badly" !)
- Lots of possibility for expansion and new content which will only make this system stronger

Cons:
- Due to lots of enemy and player ability interactions, there are some "what happens in this situation?" sorts of questions that the rules don't always answer
- While there is *plenty* of strategy and luck mitigation baked into the game, there is still a decent amount of randomization (between the enemies you face, the encounters you draw, and the dice rolled in combat). Sometimes things can go poorly, which can feel oppressive, and some people might not be able to stomach it.

Overall, even when I lose, I want to play again. Each game is different from the next, even though you're mostly just fighting. It's incredible how much strategy is packed into a 4x4 grid. Rolling dice has never felt this good.

RATING: 10
Components: 5/5

Overall, the quality is superb, although I would prefer better quality control. 

The images are not centered on the faces of the dice. Most of my dice have printing towards the edge of the dice face,  some have cracks on it, and some have poorly printed faces. However, keep in mind that I own the first edition of the game. I'm sure each subsequent print runs would have less or no defects. 

The premium chips are not poker-sized chips, but they still have a satisfying weight to them. 
 
The optional adventure map and the top cover of an add-on character box work perfectly well together as a dice tray and encounter tracker. The art on the interior of the box cover seamlessly blends in with the map if you place it at the bottom.  

Replayability: 5/5

Multiple Character Skill Tree/ Character Line-Up: There are different ways to build each character depending on your strategy. In combination with different line-up of characters for synergy, the possibility provides endless hours to explore. Players could easily use multiple characters in a single playthrough. (I used three for a solo game, work wonders)

Campaign: Given that there are 30 encounter cards and you only use a portion per campaign, every campaign plays out differently. (not to mention the different specific encounter cards for each of the 7 bosses and each encounter card gives you two options to make!) Some options could add specific encounter cards to your existing campaign encounter deck as a consequence to your decision and to carryout your specific path/choice. 

Rules + Game Mechanics: 5/5

Rules: In my case, I find the rules to be well-written. I am not aware of any standards on how to write a rule-book, but it seems to be quite easy to follow. To prepare for my playthrough, I watched one video of Ricky Royals playthrough, read the rulebook from start to finish in a single sitting, and then highlighted any specific details. I have not run into any specific issues with the game mechanics yet. 

Game Mechanics: The solo, 1 player experience is inferior to the cooperative experience. Solo is a great way to learn a character, but it limits interactions with different gearlocs. As you customize your gearlocs to fulfill their intended role, you would discover new synergy between different characters' skill trees. Trying out new builds and line-up makes each battle interesting and unique. 

Add-On Characters: 5/5

The characters are what make the game so great and add to the replayability. Other potential future expansions I would recommend are additional bosses with specific encounter cards, different baddie types or variety, and a structured campaign. The character boxes also work well as my dice tray. The illustrated inner cover provides a area to lay the add-on map and work as a dice tray.

Final Verdict: 5/5

Too Many Bones deserve its own spot on my "favorite solo-able games" shelf alongside Mage Knight, Robinson Crusoe, Kingdom Death, and Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective.

I played a few times through with different characters and different bosses. First, the game is by far the best-designed game for all the parts. Every characters mice pad-
like cut-out mat, to the field mat, to the waterproof cards... by far, top notch. A problem I have is the rules may be overall complex that we have to refer to the faq online almost once a day because something wasn't clear. Also, the character sheet and the character mat should have some correlation between what the 16 ability dice. Each time I had to search the character sheet for the logos on the dice compared to having something saying it is the medkit dice (which is what it says on the mat, but not on the sheet) or the return fire shoot. And lastly, it seemed whoever was playing a tank character, they either never got a turn on the first, or at least by the second round, because they were KO'd... making sure the ground stayed where it should be. I don't know... I enjoyed it, I would play it again, but it didn't make me want to get it for my personal collection and I probably only play it if someone else picked it.

RATING: 9
What an amazing, intelligently designed game. It's quite rare to see some truly new and innovative mechanics in board games nowadays and TMB excells at it. The baddie points and how enemies enter the battlefield are genius. The game is incredibly challenging and rewardig. And OMG, the components. One of the best in quality I've seen so far (pretty much on par with Mechs VS Minions)!

The only thing preventing me from giving it a ten is the fucking horrible rulebook and terrible graphic design choices. This made me even furious at times for such a great game being so hard to learn because of bad written rules. Typography is horrible, making the rule book and cards hard to read and understand. No hierarchy of information is respected. Text color and background texture on cards have terrible contrast. I mean - SERIOUSLY - why the hell a company like Chip Theory Games, which clearly cares about quality  in their games and likes to set the bar high, did not invest in proper graphic design?

This aside, the game is wonderful to play. But the learning curve is steep X2 simply because the game is complex AND the rule book sucks.

RATING: 8
The asymmetry is massive, and the game is a blast solo. Once you add more players, the pace slows, but the game is still fun--though you do have to keep it brisk-moving. It is perhaps best solo, though. The customization is very fun, though I doubt you're going to upgrade a given character very differently from play to play. 
I will say that I find the publisher's attitude towards components to be insufferable. They brag about their components endlessly, and charge a heavy premium for them, but seems baffled and unprepared when people point out their obvious shortcomings--slippery and difficult to read cards (should have gone with normal cardstock), fraying player mats (they're not "supposed" to fray, so all must be well), chips with the tiniest of icons (but... they're chips!)... Come on, guys. Sometimes the paradigm exists for a reason.

I've got probably 15 games of this under my belt now and I've loved every one of them. What a great game. Only negative is the cost, but once you're past that, it's a stellar game.

(Also, for the cost, you're getting top notch components)

There's a lot of rules, and the rule book is a mess. An FAQ is severely needed. Feels like the rules are beta-rules. This has been improved a bit with the second edition.

The components are nice, but not really worth the cost. You quickly forget that you are using neoprene mats and poker chips. I'd rather have paid half the cost and have cardboard components.
The game is good though (once you learn the rules and check ambiguous effects). There are a lot of interesting options for character building. Lots of replayability. Lot's of co-operation among the players. The battles provides the players with interesting choices. It's a dice game, but not too random (and that's from someone who dislikes dice). It's really hard and rewards repeated plays. The difficulty of the different encounters are really swingy.
It's a really unique game.

I got recently the game in Spain. The components are great. I opened the game on Friday and have played around 10-12 games solo. I am hooked. The game is difficult and it is very challenging, most of the games are solved by one or two strategic decisions as well as dice results. The mix is great. As solo, you can play with 1 or 2 gearlocs and I am seriously thinking about handling 4 although it could be a bit overwhelming. The gearlocs are very different so it is a lot of fun and experience to learn them. I highly recommend the game. Rules could be more complete but I am having fun investigating videos of playthroughts, forums, FAQs,... I guess it is an adventure by itself...:)

Edit: adjusted to a 9 as I feel it could have more story development

Excellent game design in every respect, components, writing, game mechanics and balance all top notch. Mentally challenging to stay on top of all the different options for character creation and play, at least to start with. Works great solo, but even better as a cooperative adventure where intelligent teamwork and personal sacrifice are rewarded in satisfying ways. Playtime closer to 3 hours than 2 for 3-4 players. A shoutout to the lovely folks at CTG who replaced a deck of cards that had warped in the sun for no cost and threw in bonus loot! Looking forward to the expansion.

I have been seriously blown away with the perfect game-length versus complexity of this very smart and streamlined RPG. Typically, I am not a fan of die combat at all; but the smart use of misses in backup plans and the thrill of unlocking new unique dice, has created an unexpected urge. The strongest desire to get straight-back into the fray after a defeat, I've ever experienced in a co-op game. 
The fun and varied choices each encounter presents, the tension of impending enemy attacks, and a passionate wish I could unlock more skills at once, all add up to a truly memorable experience. An experience I wish was more accessible to a wider audience, but is unfortunately going to hit many hurdles because of the price of entry. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- As it has been stated everywhere, yes, the components are beyond exceptional: The best storage box I've ever witnessed, the quality of the countless dice, the wonderful quirkiness of the art and the impeccable writing which is honest-to-goodness both hilarious and enthralling all at once. 
- The most satisfying leveling system of any RPG game ever.
- Dice are always a thrill to throw and use is the puzzle-like die assignment.
- Every character is tactically different from one another with amazing replay-ability thanks to varied skill trees and loot combos. 
- Individual battle mashups are rarely over 15 minutes apiece. 
- The mini games of lock-picking and Dangerous Darts are really fun quick interactions that actually add to the role-playing experience in a surprisingly immersive way. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
 
- The price.
- It's tough.
- That is all.

Immersive gameplay with high quality components (custom dice, neoprene mats, heavy chips and great artwork). This is so welcome in a world full of mediocrity.

[Favourite story game]

RATING: 7
First the good stuff, which I can summarize as the player mats, the character-building, and the chips. Player mats are neoprene with slots for all of the dice that track your abilities, skills, locked rolls and misses, which can be stored and used for special character-specific actions. The mats excellently facilitate character management and are fun to use. Every character comes with a unique set of dice, each representing a skill that a player can acquire between encounters. These dice get added to your dice pool and have a wide range of effects from character to character. The learning curve for the game lies here - learning your character's skill dice, what order you should get them in and how best to use them. Player cards give advice for these choices and as you are figuring things out, you won't go wrong just picking what they suggest to keep the game moving. The dice are high-quality and while the symbols are not necessarily intuitive, your excellent character-specific reference breaks it all down for you. And lastly, as most folks familiar with this publisher knows, the chips used to represent your character and monsters in battle are nicely weighted and clearly laid out.

Now, for the rest of the game. Players start by picking a "boss" to fight. Bosses have to be defeated in a certain number of days (1 day = 1 adventure card/encounter), but cannot be encountered until you have accumulated X number of adventure points (cards usually grant 0-2 each). Once you have the points, you have until the target number of days to beat the boss. If you decide meet the boss before the last day (as long as you have the points, you can choose to fight him), you can keep encountering him until the days are spent. You really only lose the game by not defeating the boss in the allotted days. An encounter/day is a drawn card that offers two choices, one usually harder with a better reward. Most are fights, but not all. When you fight you draw a value of monster chips (they come in 1, 5, and 20) equal to the day you are on times two (5th day = 10 points = two 5-point monster chips). The battle grid is a 4x4 grid with two outer ranged combat rows and two inner melee rows. Characters and monsters fight only in one category or the other and are placed accordingly. Players and monsters then move and attack in initiative order.

So beyond character development, the rest of the game is pretty mundane. There is no compelling story arc and no campaign. Each adventure is a simple build-up to a boss fight and that is it. The next boss you take on you are starting from scratch. The battle mat is cramped with limited tactical opportunities, although I do like that misses can be collected, saved, and used for special character-specific actions. The loot you find is not that interesting. None of it is terrible, but many other games handle these aspects in more interesting and compelling ways. I just don't really see enough here to justify the spend for me. If you love character development and high-quality components over story and strong tactical game play, then by all means this could be the game for you.

Fantastically produced tactical battle game with some campaign elements.

Dice are used in an interesting way - its still possible to 'roll badly' but dice always have a use and your never left entirely without options due to the 'back up plan'. Each face of the die relate to abilities that can be performed rather than as attack modifiers, making skill selection & use much more interesting.

It looks quite tough, but there are several characters available, and each provides its own strategic puzzle against the overall mission that you are playing as well as how to best approach individual encounters that you face on the way to your destination.

My one play was a lot of fun, looking forward to unpacking this one further in July.

Eh... it is a game.  I thought the mechanics didn't seem completely thought through and the game's difficulty was almost arbitrary in how it spiked at times.

Players assume the roles of Gearlocs (elf/gnome/goblinish creatures) and embark on a quest to save the world from a nasty enemy in a fantasy world. This game has some truly unique components and a wide variety of dice that are both rolled and/or used as trackers. This is an adventure/combat game where you improve your characters over the course of the game to prepare for a final battle. Decisions are made along the way to advance the story (which is unique each game). Definitely and entertaining game with lots of thinking and great re-playability.

This is a VERY heavy co-op game. This game is better equipped for learned gamers. Gamers who have played for a few years and gamers who even enjoy the pc game League of Legends. It's not that there is a high learning curve but you definitely need to know your character because if you're playing the game for the first time as a group nobody has enough time to help you play your character. With that said, I absolutely LOVE this game even with it being difficult to win. I love the challenge it presents and can't wait for the day we pit this game in it's place!

I enjoy a good dice chucker that isn't a complete luckfest, and this game fits the bill. It's equally fun to play solo, or with friends. It's good looking, and has high quality components. It can be a bit of a pain to teach for one-off games, though. I'd recommend this more for folks that like to experience the same game many times over. That said, there is a good amount of content between the different tyrants and the various gearlocs and the different ways to build up your gearlocs that you should have a satisfyingly unique experience each time.

Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous "baddie" responsible.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Seems like it scales well with any number of people - plays well with two. It is challenging and the dice can and will let you down. After one play of the suggested nemesis/scenario, we failed miserably after a couple poor rolls did us in. The game gets much more challenging the longer the game goes but it takes a fair bit of time to develop your character. Failing an adventure can be catastrophic and makes it even harder to win the game. The dice and components are top notch as is typical of Chip Theory Games...and they love their chips. Somewhat fiddly but likely fairly straightforward once you have the rules down.

Too Many Bones is the essential elements of tabletop RPG boiled down into an exciting, challenging, and often times thrilling adventure.

Too Many Bones is highly-thematic and yet does not take itself too seriously due to the endearing characters. The lore created just for this game could almost fit into the Tolkien universe, with character and enemy backstories which make them feel like part of their own living, breathing universe. The components are all VERY high-quality with the feel of the cards, dice, character mats, and even the weight of the enemy chips making for a tactile, not to mention tactical, experience. This is a game that I will enjoy playing solo and with my family for many years to come. It is as deep as I want it to be, nonlinear, and thus highly replayable – I am very satisfied with my time spent in Daelore and already contemplating my next return.

A jillion awesome dice, beautiful cut-out mats, plastic cards and poker-chip characters give this game incomparable table presence. The repetitive gameplay drags the experience down though and the 4x4 battle ground results in overly long battles that outstay their welcome.

The best components in a game next to Mechs vs. Minions. Absolutely well thought out game mechanics and diverse characters and Bosses.

This is easily in the top 5 games component-wise for me.  The game presentation is really well done.  For gameplay, I am equally impressed.  I love how dice are used in the game and how even bad rolls can serve some purpose.  The game is tough and you really need to understand your character in order to play up his strengths to increase your chance of success, but the journey is enjoyable either way.  The biggest challenge for this game is its price, but if you like dice games with some depper elements to them, this is a game worth investing in.

Believe the hype.  The Goblin King is a 3-1/2 hour campaign but easily accomplished on a long game day or split between game nights.  TMB is a master’s class in overstuffed, awkwardly-produced gaming... but any changes to it would feel significantly less epic.

The only thing keeping TMB from a full 10 is a campaign mode (on its way), more baddies/encounters (on its way), and more variety in their battles (which may be coming).

I was blown away by the component quality of this game. Everything from the dice, chips and player pads. This is something to behold if you have not seen this in person. The game play is solid to boot. Having almost a feeling of Qwarriors set to a dungeon crawl. Being able to customize your character as an RPG light game easy to learn and teach.

Kickstarted for it.  This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life.  It is cooperative, requires strategy yet turns are not too long, the characters are unique, have depth, and are fun to play, the skill tree is fun to build...  One of the most fun aspects of this game is how you build a pool of dice you CAN roll, but you can only roll your dexterity number of dice each turn, so you have to choose carefully each turn.  And your dice pool grows with stats and character-unique skills.  AND it's a co-op game, so everyone wins or loses together as a team.  This game is worth the high cost.  Excellent materials - designed to last rather than designed for the dump.  Go play Too Many Bones.  Get it, and play it.

Pure co-op with an unconventional fantasy theme. Interesting dice mechanisms. Combat is tactical on a small grid, but pretty streamlined. Might be a bit more on the complex side for my tastes, where you really have to study your characters to understand how to play them effectively.

Cooperative
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Too Many Bones is a cooperative tactical skirmish game that revolves around rolling custom dice that you've chosen to acquire for your character. Each scenario involves a series of these skirmishes, between which players can spend their experience points to buy new dice that are unique to their characters. Each of the characters plays very differently, as each has a different "tech tree" of dice they can buy, many of which have custom faces that don't show up anywhere else in the game. As this might imply, the game has a ton of rules overhead, and while extensive player aids are available for each player, they tend to omit a few key items which can be pretty frustrating. Scenarios themselves can be extremely long, as they involve many skirmishes, each of which can last upwards of an hour. While I definitely think the game had some nice ideas--I really liked the dice acquisition--on the whole the frustration over rules that were hard to find combined with the length and slogginess of the battles soured me on this one.

First off, this game has fantastic production.  The components are really as amazing as everyone says and lived up to my expectations in that regard.  I also had an incorrect die in one of my base characters and the customer service is fantastic.  Chip Theory mailed me the replacement within 1 week and also included a bonus treasure card. 
I wanted to like this game so badly, and I really don't mind randomness in my games (I love Descent and Imp Ass), but this game just didn't do it for me.  For more info on why it didn't, see this thread.  https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1773145/please-help-me-game

Gorgeous components meld perfectly in this highly tactical adventure game.

The three initial adventures cards can be too much predictables after some play,but the rest of the deck keeps the game fresh.

Every character has his own personality, they are very different and play very differenly from each other.

Every tyrant has his own personality too, and they are a different challenge with different  skills and offensive tricks.

A welcome surprise for 2017, the best game of this year.

Rating after two play throughs solo and on third.  May change as I delve into larger parties and other gearlocs. 
Pros
- Gameplay mechanics feel unique and new but all blend together in a thoughtful way 
- Components are top notch. No corners cut (except on rounded corner of play mats.).  
- Game is hard in a good way. 
- Each Gearlocs feels completely different adding to replayabilty 

Cons
- Game is easy enough to grasp basics but will take several play throughs to understand details and nuances of rules. 
- Cards are slippery and do not stack as well (yes I am nitpicking!)
- Box may not fit on your shelf

Pros:

- Unique gaming experience for my group

Cons:
- Set-up and tear-down time can be really long sometimes.  
- Play time for us is exceptionally long  Every multi-player game we have played has been over 4.5 hours.

General Notes:
- SUPER SLIPPERY CARDS!!!  They are made of a very durable material but man are they slippery buggers!  They slide so easily that they practically explode out of my hands.  I have to be very careful taking them out of the box.
- Box is very heavy and of a non-standard size.  This makes transportation of the game tricky.  I've had to use a large, thick canvas boat bag to carry mine around.

Still learning the game, yet to win, but after just 3 plays wasn't expecting too. Components are stellar. Just so nice to play with. Only played solo and 2 player so far but hoping for 3 and 4 player games soon. Rating a 9 but could end up a 10 depending on the learning curve and difficulty. But itching to play again, so something must be right.

Edit. 
Rating up to a 10. Seven plays now and have the rules down. Thoroughly enjoying every game. Still only playing on training as constantly playing with new players and teaching the game. Managed 3 wins now. Once you get used to the gearloc characters you can work really well together when fighting battles. Cracking game and everyone who has played it has really enjoyed it.

Just need more stuff and a campaign mode. Looking forward to see what CTG come up with for this game in the future.

RATING: 9
Too Many Bones is in many ways what I've wanted from an adventure game for a long time. I really appreciate that there are tough decisions about which dice to roll because most skill dice can only be used once per combat. Far too many dungeon crawls use a roll to resolve mechanic without enough decision space. Too Many Bones uses roll to resolve, but offers many options for how to spend your dexterity each turn, which is effectively your action points.

There are a good variety of enemies, the different Gearlocks play differently, and the different encounters and tyrants add a good amount of variety. The components are fantastic, and everything comes together really well. I especially like the way the encounters work.

All of that said, there is a fair amount of randomness in the game, which can make difficulty vary significantly. If the enemies roll really well and you roll really poorly, you're probably going to lose the encounter, particularly at lower character counts. That's not the end of the adventure by itself, but the encounters don't always scale that well, and early setbacks can be extremely costly. Later encounters can also feel too easy if the early encounters went well.

After one playthrough (2 player game) as boomer through the easiest scenario this feels rather bland. I wish the tactical map would be bigger. Maybe terrain elements would give more variety for strategies. Aside from that I really like the character playmats, as well as how your character levels up through collecting more dice, which in return gives you new abilities and combinations to try out. All characters are very different in their playstyle. The story elements feel more like a gimmick than crucial part of the game and scenario replayability seems to be low after initial playthrough. On the plus side the production is great. I hope a more story driven game picks up the dice mechanics and playermats, since this could have been easily an 8 or higher. In its current state it's somewhere between a 5 and 6 for me.

Top-notch components make getting into this game super easy, but excellent game play keeps you around.

Captures the 'epic quest' feel of a far more sprawling adventure/questing game in a fraction of the time. Characters offer interesting possibilities and multiple build paths like WoW skill trees that allow you to play the same character pretty differently over several play sessions.

I also love the 'bones' system where you may miss (roll bones) and that sucks, but it still helps you power up in other ways. It's not exactly luck mitigation but instead it is perhaps luck 'cushioning', where the bones mean your misses aren't completely failures.

If you like questing games at all, then check this one out. Even if you don't usually like dice chuckers, this may still appeal to you with the 'bones' system.

A little too fiddly for it's own good out the gate -  but once I wrapped my head around it it became one of my favorites!  It's very tense and we've usually been able to puzzle our way out of what appear to be unwinnable situations by capitalizing on enemy behaviors and spending our training points intelligently against the enemy mix - which is good because a few losses in a row can really ruin your campaign.  

I would also add that Chip Theory Games customer service is just outstanding.  They seem very humble and appreciative of their fans and will make things right with you should you have a complaint.  Don't have any fear with regards to engaging with them as direct to consumer outlet only.

That said, I have two gripes with this game that keep it from being a 10:

1.  The character reference sheets could have been made way more digestible.  There's just too much flavor text mixed in and it's a major turn off to many new players when you had them their sheet.  They could have greatly streamlined those and potentially fit in the different baddie traits on there as well so you don't have to keep passing the one copy around.  There's too much time spent trying to digest everything because they tried to put too much where it doesn't necessarily belong.

2.  The decision to always have the same 3 starting events makes sense from a balance perspective, but they really needed to include more variants here.  Luckily this is getting corrected in expansions, but it should be in the main box.  

All in all, these are nits.  But the net net of my complaint number one means we wont often get this to the table in a group setting but my wife and I will be playing it for years to come!

Played a few games now. Delightfully produced, splendid to look at, but I still have questions and issues. First, the character development seems more shallow that I thought when reading the rules. Often, one skill or another does not appear to change things much. Since you can't develop character to match the type of monsters (except maybe the final boss), and hardly know much in advance what's coming, you pretty much use the dice you think are generally best for your character and hope it works. Also, since most special abilities cannot be used reliably (it depends on the skill, but you have a good chance of rolling bones and having to try again next time), then even if you have the right combination, you have to hope for a good roll, and only some specific items can allow rerolls. Last game, I took cripple, and it never triggered, not in a single combat.
Second, the tactical combat board seems basic to the point of being irrelevant. You place your melee in the second row close to the enemy melee and basically move when an enemy is down, while range, having no line of sight to deal with, just pretty much stay in place the whole time.
Also, the game is just too long. I

More games to be played. I still want to try, but I hope to discover strategic paths that I might have missed.

This is a fantastic single-serving "RPG". The mechanics are fun and inventive, and the choices you make are meaningful. The only problem I really have with this one, is there is a decent amount of effort to learn whatever character you are playing, and it would be fairly difficult for anyone who isn't a "hardcore" gamer. But for me and my regular gaming buddies, this is perfect.

I really love this game, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like an abundance of dice. While the learning curve is steep (not necessarily in the rules, but in each character), the payoff is an immensely deep, strategic game that is a hell of a lot of fun. I mostly play solo, but have introduced it to others who also end up loving each adventure. 

The difficulty is certainly real, but playing a long game only to lose doesn't feel as frustrating as you'd think. You always learn and develop your skill set, and think about what you can do next game to beat that 20 pt baddie or that Tyrant that got you at the last second. 

While the box art and characters aren't my favorite (I'm a sucker for dark design), the components are beautiful, and the smaller images of baddies and tyrant cards sport fantastic artwork. The dice are really well made, and the playmat/cards/reference sheets are of the best quality. 

I wasn't entirely sold on this when I got it; I didn't know if I could get into all the dice tossing and 'rogue-esque' style of progression, but damn. I understand why some may not be into this one with it's complexity and (honestly) sometimes ruthlessness, but this is easily one of my favorite games. Only wish I had all the extra characters!

Wooh boy is the learning curve steep, but once you get past that you really feel like you are playing a video game rpg but with dice. Surprisingly a dice filled game such as this have lots of strategic decisions as well as tactical. You can truly set yourself up for success or failure based on your own choices plus a little luck going either way.

Had fun and it has a solo mode, but it isn't so hard to solo play multiple characters either. That is the sweet spot to this game. Making your team of gearlocs work together with their different abilities to complete scenario.

Can't wait to see what they will add to this system.

The hardware is beyond any doubts among the best I have ever seen. The rule book is done very well, but it takes its time to read and to transfer everything onto the game.

The RPG elements just feel like glue to tie a story together but once you are in the encounter it is the team versus the bad guys, where "the team" is each player controlling a chess piece on the 4 x 4 battle mat (chess board).
As each turn completes you will likely have opportunity to gain more powers (dice). Each game plays differently because you might play the same character and choose different dice, or play a different character entirely. Each character has their own unique special abilities (e.g. tinkerer, warrior, spellcaster, grenadier, trapper, etc ...).
I am sure after you have played a few times you could get play time down to the suggested 60-120 mins, however in our first game with 4 players we played for closer to 3 hrs.

Initial impression: I've spent enough time setting up the game and trying to learn the rules, but haven't played a full game yet.

The rules are really as bad as everybody says. The rule book kind of just explains what everything does (well, not quite everything) but you don't get a sense of how it all fits together or what you're actually supposed to do. I've seen people online suggest that others are overstating how bad the rules are. Those people are either playing horribly wrong themselves or their brain works in some sort of Beautiful Mind type of way that is able to retain and assemble the entire rulebook into a way that makes sense.

The gameplay seems decent enough. You upgrade a character and roll dice for combat. However, there does seem to be a problem if you lose an encounter once or twice. You don't get any kind of rewards after losing and when you retry the encounter it is more difficult each time. This could result in an impossible situation unless you get really lucky with the dice on the second/third time. For a game that is attempting to recreate an RPG feel this seems antithematic since you usually get some sort of experience or loot after losing a battle, but in this game the more you lose the harder it gets.

There's also the production. The physical quality is of course incredible, but some of the printing isn't great. The printing on the mousepad material is overall darker than it should be and some of the colors don't pop like they should. The same goes for the plastic cards. Everything just looks too dark where it should be pleasantly bright and colorful. The cards at least should have been printed like regular cards as I don't see any advantage to them being plastic. It also seems like the printing could eventually rub off, but I have no idea how durable it actually is.

Will rate after some actual plays, hopefully the game is worth the effort.

Update: Well, the game isn't worth the effort. Despite the incomprehensible rules, I've realized that the game itself just isn't very good. You basically just upgrade your character and then have a fight. Do this over and over for what could be hours (some online reports have been well over three hours). The upgrades aren't all that interesting and the fighting isn't very fun. And even though I have a basic understanding of how the game works now, you still constantly have to look up keywords on enemies and what each of your character's skills do. I will say that with a proper set of rules my opinion of the game would be a little higher, but between the rules and the gameplay this just isn't for me.

Updated...5 games in.  One win, I've only played with 2 characters so far.  Absolutely brilliant game.  The depth of each character coupled with the different bosses and the villains that each bring a particular group of 'Baddies" with them give this huge replay potential.  I spend time on days I can't get it to the table to just go through the characters and their tech trees.  This may wind up to be my favorite game of all time.  This game is fantastic.

Excellent game and presentation.  Character progression in a sitting is quick and fun and is the meat of the game outside battle.  The game is not designed to be campaigned. You build a small deck of encounters with thintention kfof working through them in one sitting.  I can see it taking too long for one evening unless the players are experienced.

The rulebook is adequate to learn the basics, but the rules lawyer in me was left with several major questions. 

The battles can be daunting at first with several effects to keep track of once you reach mid-range.

So much of the game is specific to each gearloc, and dice which are unique skills that break the normal rules for that die. be prepared to have your first game take a while for new players, since they need to learn their gearloc.  Watching the video from the publisher about your character is very useful.

Once you've learned it, it is a blast.

Fantastic game! Love the mechanics (such an unique blend!), but not the artwork (amateurish), the components (mouse pads?) or the universe (not distinctive enough)... Giving it a 9.5 despite all of that tells a lot about how good the game is.

The game can be really tough but also is a lot fun.  Beautiful and very high quality components.  If you want a fun and relatively quick roleplaying game with lots of dice this would be a great pick.

"RPG" is kind of a misnomer for this game. This is a tactical fantasy combat game with character progression mechanics.

That said, TMB is a joy to play, not just because of the great components (i wish more games would use PVC cards) but also because it's much deeper than it initially appears. The abundance of dice might lead someone to believe that this is a luck fest, but the "bones" mechanism and the ability to not use your rolled dice make for some great and clever mitigation. Enemies all feel different and the tyrant fights are a lot of fun in a videogamey sort of way.

The reason it "only" gets an 8 rather than a 9 is twofold: 1. The game is very much based around countering or mitigating enemy abilities and creating the right build for your gearloc to do that. As a result, replayability tends to diminish somewhat the better you understand your gearloc's skills. 

2. This is probably the biggest design flaw in the game: The number and strength of baddies you'll fight steadily scales up with each passing encounter, but generally you only get encounter rewards (i.e. the opportunity to level up your gearlocs) if you win. Meaning the game has a negative feedback loop where losing 1 encounter (even closely) makes subsequent ones harder to win. On some of the "shorter" tyrants where every single training point and loot card matters, losing even 1 encounter can result in a guaranteed loss.

I like this game ok but it does have some issues in my opinion. I think this game's general rating is positively skewed due to the component quality - which is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't feel like a game that is an 8-9 to me based on the gameplay. I think when I get Gloomhaven 2nd printing this game will rarely get played and I will probably get rid of it.

*Update - don't have Gloomhaven yet but I've sold this one on. I am sure someone else will get more enjoyment out of it than I did.

Via Too Many Bones: Undertow - Backed on Kickstarter (2017)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Too Many Bones has continually impressed me with each play. This is the reason I've rated it a 10. With that stated, it is not a game that just any gamer will jump into. It is a heavier game and learning each Gearloc will take multiple plays to understand each build and how to best utilize the characters.  I enjoy the character development and dice building for each character. This makes them each so unique and enjoyable to play. I expect to be playing Too Many Bones for years to come!

RATING: 4
The good things about Too Many Bones: the characters are distinct and interesting, and the setup of a mini-campaign with encounters leading up to a boss for a single playthrough is great. There is a lot of potential in the design.

However, the game, as it stands, is not very good. The instructions and reference material are not at all clear. The game mechanics are unnecessarily complex (for its ultimately simple play) and poorly explained enough to make figuring out how to play a huge problem. The silly theme and endless amount of typos and poor text editing make the game seem poor quality despite the great components. For as long as it was in development, these issues are astonishing. Was this game even playtested by people who had to read the rules themselves?

As for the gameplay, it is reasonably fun but horribly balanced. The number of enemies you face are scaled for player count, but many other aspects of encounters (non-combat skill checks or how combat is set up) is not scaled the same way and obviously much easier or harder for different player counts. The developers claim that the game is just hard to beat and strategically deep. This comes off as a lame excuse to not care about balance. If the game is coop and the win percentage is claimed to be low, then who cares if it's balanced? What's the difference between a coop win percentage of 20% and 30%?

If you are going to be scummy enough to charge extra for additional character classes that are available at launch, at least make a rulebook that adequately explains how to play and doesn't need countless erratas for all the wrongly worded game text that you couldn't be bothered to carefully proofread during the long development time.

Dice building fantasy war game.   Fantastic components.  I like that a lot of positional  tactics and decision making are possible in a fairly small footprint.  The story writing is very good.  Has some counter intuitive play and rules that will take a while to absorb.   The fiddly aspects with the chips and dice add to the tactile engagement with the game and part of the enjoyment and fun--at first.

The game looks nice, the rule-book is simply insufficiently/professionally edited.
This really starts to get on my nerves, I know it's hard to write good rules but hey this is the heart of your game. 
So what do I think of this. It reminds me a bit of Doomsrock, with even less encounters (unfortunately). However the combat mechanics themselves and the AI is quite simple and enjoyable. First play was 4 hours, 8 days, which is just too long. I did like playing the grenade thrower. So overall, I can see the faint shimmer of a good game, poor rules layout and long game play makes this a pass. I might play again, if the other options are even worse than this.

PS: Why can't game companies handle 3 or 4 uniform gamebox sizes?

I think I was a little blinded by the quality of the components. But it really is just way to luck based / swingy for my taste. A bad initiative roll and you can be dead before your first turn, it just stopped being fun in a hurry.

C'est la vie.

Fun to play, apart from the high production value, the draw of the game is mainly based about the unique building of your character as you charter through a story quest. I wouldn't say the questing through the story was particularly exciting (the owner didn't even bother reading the event cards). The main draw of the game in my opinion is towards players who like the uniqueness of each character and enjoy the feeling of building up their character "optimally" to complete each story quest.

Got to play my first session of TMB and wow. That's all... wow. But too elaborate it is such a great game, very well produced and very intricate gameplay. I can honestly say I've never played anything like... this coming from someone who owns close too many BoardGames. 
One downside, if a downside... is I feel like I'm wrestling with understanding everything. There's a lot to it but that is part of the charm too, I think. 
I look forward to this staying on my table for the time to come and wrestling with this behemoth (seriously huge box). 
Thanks for the great game

Phew. It's expensive but i have to say that it's a very very good. The dice building is excellent and customizing your character's abilities is very rewarding. A training point earned is precious and you feel excited to spend it for upgrades. The battles are tactical for sure but still need to decide who attack what and in what order.  There is a variety in the baddies  and there are interesting and different encounters.

My only concerns so far is that there aren't that many encounters, especially for solo play. So i would like to see more. But the main concern is whether a particular character has flexibility in what upgrades to get. This means that although at first glance it appears that you have many options in reality you always follow the same path. Not sure.

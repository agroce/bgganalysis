Techno Witches mixes Wings of War style of gameplay with movement programming from RoboRally. The result is a super chaotic experience with bags of laughter. This is again one of those games where losing does not feel bad since it is simply too hilarious of a moment when you realise you have misjudged your trajectory and end up crashing. The above does not mean that the game would not fit serious gamers, since the race can be intense. You just won't be taking it too seriously, I hope. 

I also reckon that the game can well be played with children as well, and as a matter of fact, will teach them how to plan ahead and extrapolate. 

Personally I find Techno Witches a fun game when you want to give your analytical side a break. It does not involve too many decisions and plays fast.

I really liked this the first time i played it, and eventually found a copy. The spacial aspects of this game are very good, but i can see how some people are put off by the analogue precision required not to bump the board (a little like card house building). As for the racing, it is quite varied and interesting. With less players precision on long flights is easier to maintain, with more the piece limitation really makes for some difficult choices (watch for people hoarding the good pieces :). It is probably the best witch broom flying game I've played.

AirSpaceNavalBattle, MultiOnly

The flying mechanics resemble those of Wings of War (programming flight paths represented by cards or some other token with different directions), but the game has a very light and funny theme that screams to be truly Harry Potter licensed, with a couple of Quidditch add-ons (perhaps the "backyard" quiddith with just the quaffle, and the full-fledged quidditch with quaffle, bludger, and maybe even snitch).  The programming element involves spellbooks with up to five slots, but the game moves quickly because programming involves drafting, rather than picking and choosing from your own hand of cards.  The fact that you can choose to fly at any time also makes the game move more quickly, plus gives you the ability to "react" to your opponents; if someone appears to be winding up to reach the kitty, for instance, you can move earlier to block them.

The game is quite fun, and the theme is non-violent.  Not the complexity of Wings of War, but this is a great family game, and nice filler at the end of a game night.

And I really want a Quidditch scenario.  And perhaps just a general expansion, with more witches, although apparently an eight-player scenario will be available one of these days. Perfect, because I got two copies of this game.  :)

Fun light tactical racing game where you need a lot of spatial insight. Best strategy is to fly with as many tiles as possible at once. Only problem is that it is pretty hard to envision your future flightpath when the tiles are lying at your spellbook. In this it gets a feel of a push your luck game when it's actually a pure skill game. If players want to play cutthroat they can also try to block others. Esspecially when they already programmed a lot of tiles this can be devastating. Best part about the game is watching the less skilfull players flying around like drunk bumblebees.

RATING: 6
A race game whose core mechanic is estimations.  If you can mentally connect various curved pieces end-to-end in a sequence that avoids obstacles (and other player pawns), you will excel at this game.  If not, you'll keep bumping into buildings or players and lose the race... but this is only funny for one or two games.  This game is mostly skill, partially luck, and a little strategy... I guess it feels like a dexterity game in that respect.  None of the pieces are straight so there is often a rush for the almost-straight pieces.

Fun and funny game that combines spatial thinking with...more spatial thinking.  if you can't stand the heat don't go near the witch's small but functional (it's all they really wanted and for the price it was  steal anyway) kitchenette.

Quite an interesting game - and with a variety of scenarios - will not wear out soon!

Nice, light racing game that plays quickly and has a variable setup each time.  Its definitely unique among my collection, and I'm looking forward to playing it a few more times.  I don't think it will bog down with more players if you keep people on task, and nobody over thinks it.

Really, this game is pretty fun.  Like Wings of War, but your path has to be much more accurate.  There is some good tactics here as well in terms of choosing to fly to block someone and waiting for someone to block you as long as possible for someone to get others out of your way.  The rules aren't too specific and causes some house rules, but other than that, this is solid.

RATING: 4.5
Great theme. Nice components, although in the game I played it seemed like the witches didn't want to stay assembled. I think if you are willing to use a dab of glue, that can be solved.

We played the version where you are trying to capture a cat or ram the broomstick of the witch currently in possession of the cat. I have to say, I was relieved when the game ended. I'd rather play a dexterity game, than a game like this. 

In Techno Witches, you have to eyeball the pieces and try to figure where you are going to end up. If you guessed wrong, you can lose your whole turn. The novelty of the theme wore off quickly for me, leaving a kind of painful process of trying to maneuver my broom around. We played with 4 players, and it seemed like after just the first or second turn, a couple players had no chance of being competitive due to poor positioning. 

If this played in 5 minutes (which it conceivably COULD) I'd rate it higher. If it takes 45 minutes (which our game did) I don't want to play.

I have really enjoyed this game and found the exposure of my tragic inability to predict the effect of arc turns hilarious.  I would rate it higher except that, so far, my family has not shared my enthusiasm (At. All.), so it gets very little play.

A decent kids game for a change, not the typical worthless fluff at all.  This is a neat game of visualization that bears some resemblance to Wings of War but with a theme that should be appealing to fans of The Worst Witch, Kiki's Delivery Service, and that other kids-at-witch-school thing.  The scenarios are fun and can be modified to suit the players.  Not the bad game I expected from looking at the box art at all.

RATING: 8
Silly design, realy stupid english title (slightly better in german: Zauber Stauber), however it is a nice fast fun game with simple rules, a bit like Wings of War, but the components are more solid (cardboard), so the flight path can be handeld better. In contrast to robo rally or wings of war player can wait and collect moves and decide when to resolve the stored program. Fewer players than 4 might be less fun less blocking interaction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a serious game by any means, half the fun is invariably having one or more players veering wildly off-course.  I do wish the rulebook outlined more scenarios, although it hasn't been difficult to come up with some of our own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a race game where players choose a move tile which come in an assortment of curves from a common pool and place it onto their magic book.  The book holds up to 5 such moves.  When a player decides to move rather than draw a tile, each tile is placed in order, oriented as it was on the book.  The object is to reach a particular point while staying inside the play area and not colliding with objects or other players.  

Simple, fast, fun, light.

I'm not generally a fan of "analog" (measuring) games. This was light and quick enough, though, that I was able to have fun. I didn't hurt that I seemed to win. :-) Having various scanerios helps to keep it fresh. But in the end, it's still one that I don't need to own, and it's not enough to crack my bias against these sorts of games.

[2 plays] The best thing that can happen when I try a new game is that I like it.  The second-best thing is that I clearly don't like it and can articulate why not. This was an OK game and I wouldn't be miserable playing it in good company, but it was fundamentally not my cup of tea.  
Two main reasons: (1) the most crucial element seems to be a skill I'm rubbish at, spatial estimation. To be awesome at this game you need to be able to look at a bunch of different pieces and accurately visually predict where they'll fit when you put them on the board. I fail at this. 
And (2) the same reason I haven't cared for minis games. The teacher of this game compared it to Roborally, and I certainly see the similarities. (It also made me think of Metro and Mississippi Queen.) But I prefer a game like Roborally that happens on a fixed grid to one that's free-form. A minor accidental jostle to the table shouldn't be able to determine the outcome of a game. And I like programming and planning more than estimating and visualizing.

Unusual game of flying around on vacuum cleaners.  It has a nice balance of flying slowly but surely, or trying to move quickly with a more extensive flight plan.

An ultra-light table top game that works quite well. Since there are no two pieces alike it becomes impossible to plot a straight course, let alone to figure out where you'll end up after 5 moves. I find it more interesting to play than Wings of War which uses similar mechanics.

In all honesty, I put off playing this game for quite a long time because I was afraid it was going to be too much like Wreckage from Fantasy Flight (silver line) which for some reason we hated. Once we actually broke it out and figured it out and played some rounds, I am bummed I let it sit that long. It's actually a lot of fun. It has a very Roborally feel to it as you build up your "programmed moves" and then execute them and hope it all works out without crashing. Fun silly times had by all.

Okay, so this is basically Things I'm Bad At: The Game.  My spatial reasoning skills aren't too good. Figuring out where things are going to be after I move them is certainly not a skill of mine, understanding which way things point and the difference between left and right when you turn things around is a constant hindrance for me in real life, and size estimation isn't very easy for me either. So it's really not a game that I can even play with other people; I just can't keep up. Maybe if it were a computer game and I could play it solo to try to develop these skills? But it isn't really what I look for in a game experience. (1 play)

My rating on this one could swing a point either way.  The theme is so...well, "gay," that a lot of people are turned off right away.  For those that stick with it, it's basically Wings of War without the shooting.  If anyone is still left after that, it's heavily dependant on a good scenario (which there are few of).  I like this genre of game and am glad that a layer of fiddliness has been removed, but I could think of a few things I would have changed along the way.  Despite all the aforementioned, Techno Witches is still a decent little game.

Neat idea for a game, but as executed it is just not a fun game.  Add the fact that the components are ill-suited for the game.  (The fold up witches don't fold up tightly enough to actually stay together)  Wooden or plastic pieces would have been better for the actual witches while the rest of the pieces are fine as is.  These are the first component issues I've had with a Kosmos game.

This is a tricky little racing / spatial logic game that is fun and easy to teach. Selecting how many flight paths to program before actually moving creates opportunities to cut off and screw opponenets, as well as opportunities to misjudge your own path and screw yourself. I really like how your flight selections become more challenging as everyone loads up their spellbooks with flight plans.

RATING: 7
Uninspiring theme, and the game's name is enough to prevent you from finding opponents.  "Do you want to play 'Techno Witches'?"  However, going in with no expectations, I was pleasantly surprised.  I've never played a game like this before.  I've seen comparisons with Roborally, but the programming here relies much more on your ability to spatially visualize what will happen.  The angles at which the witches fly are odd and it is hard to see exactly how multiple angles will add up.  In seeing the comparisons made to Wings of War, I'm immediately interested in WoW as well.

A fun short family game. Also a good filler for gamers. The flying is very similar to wings-of-war, but this theme (witches on vacuum cleaners)is much better for the non-wargamer crowd. Good components except that you will have to use a dab of glue to get your stand-up witches to hold together.

I would actually play a game or two of this once in a while. Something about the design of the pieces makes them a little misleading, so I found myself flying way off course despite a firm belief that I knew exactly where I was going.

Technowitches strenght is, that it's mix of rules and components; it's up to you what kind of game you want to play. Nice "filler-kind-of-game" and works well with different kind of players.

A racing game where you are trying to race your witch around various obstacles and get back to the other side of the board.  You use a template to trace you path.  You cannot measure beforehand but you can look at the template.  

It played relatively fast, but I found the game forgettable.

RATING: 7
Another take on the programmed move mechanic.  Introduces backing up.  More importantly, it gives you the choice to add a maneuver or execute all programmed maneuvers each turn.  This makes for a kind of push-your-luck element, because if any of your programmed moves are not possible when you try to execute them, then you have to stop with the last one that was possible.  This really could have benefitted from a license and maybe even Quidditch-like rules, though that might have been too complex.

Pretty funny game really. Nothing that a few house rules could not improve though, like cannons on your broom or smacking an opponent off their broom when hitting them faster than they are actually flying themselves.

As it is, hold the hand-brake on your broom until the power max's out & then let 'er rip!!!

The guidance of the broom is quite tricky with the pieces you use having decorations that upset your perspective.

Yeah, this is a pretty simplistic game, but it's really unique and harder than it looks. The only way to be sure you're on track is to move your witch one step at a time, but that's the least efficient way to do it. Two steps at a time seemed to be my limit, so it seems like there's a good amount of room to grow in perfecting your paths. I can easily see using this as a quick, very different filler.

Techno Witches is a racing game with a soft dexterity element. By dexterity I do not mean the need to flick or throw anything, here it is in the form of predicting where a particular move will place you at the end of a move. It's probably more akin to X-Wing rather than classic dexterity games. 

In short the players must move around a series of markers that define the circuit and the game is played directly on top of any surface. There are some move templates that can be used but the arcs of those templates are quite deceiving to the eye and the final placement of each move will often not result in what was expected. 

There are rules for collisions and the like and the game makes use of nice cardboard standees to depict the witches on their broomsticks. 

Another game that is nice to experience but really isn't likely to see a tonne of play.

Although the graphics might imply this - Techno Witches is not a children game.An online solitaire game is available at www.erlkoenig.net to take a look at the main mechanism.Here's an explanation of the name "Zauber Stauber" of the german version:"Zauber" just means "magic"."Stauber" indeed is not a valid german word - it is a new word I created based on the german word "Staub" (dust). It derives from the fictional verb "stauben" meaning "create dust" or "throw dust" - the noun "Stauber" means "something that creates dust".So "Zauber Stauber" in fact describes exactly what the techno broom in this game is doing - it throws "magic dust" (german "Zauberstaub") backwards to hurl forward through the sky.For germans this goes quite well with "Staubsauger" - vacuum cleaner - a device doing quite the opposite, absorbing dust.

Based on one play: A cute game, but the mechanic only works partially depending on which scenario you play. If the field is too big and you must steal the cat from others, it becomes too easy to run away on your own. With some minor changes though, it can be fixed. Mainly for kids though.

This game combines programmed movement with the unusual mechanic of being able to estimate distances and angles by eyeballing them.  The only other game that has this "eyeballing" mechanic that I know of is Dragon Delta, which I didn't enjoy, so I was surprised at how fun this one was.  There is a bit of a push-your-luck element--the more confident you are in your estimations, the fewer turns you have to waste actually going somewhere.  The curves in this game send you for a loop (literally and figuratively!) as they're fairly hard to visualize.  It was fun both coming up with a master plan and seeing people's plans go awry.

Based on one play so far.  Don't let the artwork put you off - this is a nice race game with programmed movement which requires players to estimate both the direction and distance of travel.  Or they can be certain of their move, and travel more slowly.  It's a shame about the magic theme, though - this is clearly some sort of ship or plane game which ought to appeal to gamers of all ages; instead, it got stuck with broomsticks - no doubt because of a certain wizard.

I've enjoyed the designer's games: Feurio and Fette Autos. This one looks interesting...

And it is. Players program witch's movements in a bid to race their broomsticks (checkpoints, tag, etc). This is done with movement strips that rang from short curves to long straigt pieces. Remiscent of Wings of War and Roborally.

Good fun with 3 to 4 players (resource scarcity) but dull with 2 players.

It's been said before: it could make a very good Harry Potter game.

library copy.

It's a race/rally game. You set up an obstacle course using included disks. Everyone has a token for their technowitch (a flying vacuum, I think - ha ha). There are a bunch of tokens of varying length and curvature (2 of each type). On your turn, you either add a token (flight path) to your flight plan ("spell book") or fly. To fly, starting at your current location you lay out each token of your path until you use them all, or are forced to abort (i.e., run into an obstacle). First one to navigate the course according to the scenario rules (e.g., race; or touch the flags; or whatever) wins. It's a game of being able to picture where each flight path will take you, and plan to fly around the obstacles and other people.

We've only tried 2 setups - basic ("Flight School") and the next one. It's an OK game, better than Dragonriders which I think has the same mechanic, but it's still not all THAT great. Light fun, though.

[RGG 2005 edition] {Fantasy, kid, racing; scenarios, geometry} Techno Witches is a unique geometry game with a strong magical theme. It's especially welcome by fans of Harry Potter. I can't easily rate it because it's very scenario dependent.

Down time may be a problem in TW; esp. when the players try each curve to see which one is the fittest. For a quicker and more meaningful game, players should not be allowed to try each curve on the table before deciding. Once they picked a curve, that's it. TW is more fun and fast with this style of playing. However, you can't always force your girl friend or wife to do so, right? :devil: 

The bits are pretty except the witches cannot hold tight. I have to use glue to firm the witches.

If your friends like and can master this game, it'd be good to own 2 copies to cater for 8 players (if down time is not a problem for your friends)!

There aren't a lot of "programming" games out there, and it's nice to see one that doesn't last two hours or more.  The visual/spatial aspect of the game makes it a bit more serious than the art and theme indicate, but it's still a nifty game of strategy, visual recognition, and racing.

It is fun right enough, however once you have your eye in then the novelty will most probably wear off.

A light game - a bit like Wings of War.  It's tougher to gauge the curves than it looks!

Neat mechanic of flying broomsticks around.  Good light game.

Minorly entertaining race game involving the off-board programming of authentic (witch-friendly) pixie dust trails.  With cats.

At least that's how my Pagan friend described it to me.

Interesting movement system. If you can visualize the plotted moves, you will do fine. I seldom can.

I can't see this ever getting played when I could play Wings of War instead, excepting games with children.

This is a fairly fun racing game where you steer a witch on a vacuum through obstacle courses.  Like a lot of race games there is a runaway leader problem and blocking can get pretty mean... but a lot of this depends on the course you are flying.  Selecting your flight path as a RoboRally feel so if you like that kind of planning ahead in your race games you might check this out... but RoboRally is a much better game in the genre.

Sure, Techno Witches isn't the most original concept (think Wings of War with simpler, shorter rules) but it is fun.  And I've only played the introductory scenario (albeit half a dozen times).  We'll see how I feel after playing a few more of the scenarios, whether or not Techno Witches is worth my time.

It's rather rare that I part with my money for a game I haven't played; however, having played Sopwith many times with my parents when I growing up (which I suppose I haven't really achieved), and loving Robo Rally, I could tell I was going to enjoy this one.  ...and enjoy it I do!  While I am supremely bad at estimating where the curved trails will put me, the miraculous accidents are quite entertaining.  Since you choose how much flight you want to plan, and thus how much risk you want to take, at a sacrifice of speed (since you're skipping more turns to fly than someone who flies quite well and fills the spellbook each time), the game automatically scales well for experience.  In addition, the missions in the game help to ramp up the difficulty gradually.  Top notch, and inexpensive, to boot!

Much, much more fun than it deserves to be. ... and so easy to make endless variants ... do a race, or catch the flag, or a demolition derby... or combine modes ... so fun.

2 copies in box for up to 8 players ... 4 v 4 deathmatch anyone?

Nice and easy game. Good price for the components but not a game for one full evenening. If you take it as a filler it's worth a closer look.

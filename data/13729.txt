RATING: 7
We've only played this as a two-player game so far - so, without influence cards, cathedrals and guild masters. I anticipate this will be a very different game with more people, so my rating of 7 applies only to a 2-player game. I agree with others that there is nothing startlingly new or unique about the mechanisms here, but this doesn't impede my enjoyment of the game. I do think that it takes an unfortunate hit in the ratings because of that, though. People seem to always feel that there are other games they'd rather play, making this game the eternal bridesmaid, never the bride.

Underrated placement and area-control game with lots of interesting choices. (traded away)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice variation on area control; with more than a few things to think about and the constant need to do lots more things than you ever can on your turn - which makes the occassional 'double turn' when you're lead player very welcome, though slightly subject to the random card draw but not excessively so. Well presented too, though an initial glance at the board rather suggests that the layout of Flemish cities was based on Celtic knotwork!

Really interesting choices. Liked this a lot. Typically beautiful Queen production.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ouch!  Among the worst area influence games I've played.  More often than not, the plays are all fairly obvious, as everyone inevitably wants in on the juiciest cities when cathedrals are added.  Often times, it came down to who got lucky enough to pull one of the "get all your cards back" golden cards (every turn the start player gets a random bonus action card... some of these let you get all of your previously played cards back, whereas you normally have to skip and entire turn to do this!).  Getting your cards back is huge, as often everyone wants to play in the same places, which you can really only do once before you have to skip a turn to get that card back again.

Also, the scoring is extremely wacky.  The difference in points between 1st and 2nd place points for a city is huge.  However, this huge point swing in each city is often decided by a tie-break where several players are very close to winning.  If you manage to win 2 cities, you have pretty good chance of winning; if you don't, you won't even be close.  It just seems way off.

There's a semi-working system here, but it is completely devoid of any fun.  I really can't think of a reason I'd play it again.

Played at Spiel 2004 with four players. Ugh, what a disappointment. I was wondering whether my glasses were dirty, or whether I was really staring at yucky pastel artwork. It caused me to misplace two of my pieces, and bothered my coplayers too. I also discovered that with four players your only viable strategy is coming in [i]second[/i] as often as possible, and blocking players who are first in towns in [i]becoming[/i] second—otherwise they win. With 4 players and 6 cities, the pigeonhold principle ensures that at least one player will win in 2 cities. The point difference between first and second place in a city is such that this makes him either the winner or the runner up. My, what fun. It might be a better game with 3, but I never bothered to test the game anew after this first experience.

This game is underrated.  I think the graphics are ok and don't distract at all.  Oh well, that is individual taste.  The only thing I can find to say about them is that the guild masters can sometimes be difficult to count up if you miss them in the detail on the tiles.  

I see enough differences in the mechanics, or at least the combination of mechanics to make this game interesting.  Interest in newer games has supplanted the desire to get on the table.

This game is very easy to teach and play.
Basically an abstract area control--
It's interesting because of the use of cards to place
(each player has the same deck, and but determines when they will play each card),
and the various shapes and placement rules help the game require more thought.
Plays particularly well with 2, and could play in under an hour if players move along.
(Our last play took about 50 mins including set up and packing away.)

RATING: 5
very easy to learn, extremely quick, straight forward gameplay. Our first session was a quick one with no arguements (always a plus). As we become more accustomed to the game I can see subtle planning being a key factor to more intense turns.

Sadly this is not an intense game, not a bad game, just so many better games.

Played in Essen 04. The game improved when the designer Wolfgang Panning joined us and corrected some of the rules we'd been told. Interesting placement game with timing required for your card play. *** Played again July 2006, really enjoyed this more, had a better understanding and progressed much better, getting a neat win by the end. More choices than you might think, for such a simple premise. Well worth checking out if you like placement games.

On my first playing of this game I won but honestly I think I lucked into it.  The rules seemed confusing.  I think there's a nice game in there though and believe it will be a better experience with more games played.  For example, I only began to understand the real strategy of the game about 75% of the way through it.  The scoring helps to clarify what you should be doing as you play the game.

The game board and pieces are attractive and interesting.

[Area Majority, Hand Management] [4P:6] A fast area majority game with some intricate timing tricks going on. Players represent guilds battling for supremacy in four cities. Pretty presentation. Some luck in the draw, which can be mitigated by switching to a card draft. Inspired use of neutral factions. As these kinds of games go, Flandern is a good entry.

RATING: 7
Flandern is a fairly simple area majority game with a couple of twists. Players are competing for influence in 6 different cities, and placement rules and limited supplies require careful commitment. There is also a neutral fifth guild that can be used by anyone to oust the rivalling guilds.

The first few turns often seem a little boring. New players tend to find the empty cities confusing because it's hard to tell what moves make sense in the long term. That feeling fades with some experience, though. Flandern gets really tense the closer you get to the end of the game. Scores are often very close to each other, and while at the beginning it often seems like there's nothing worthwhile to spend your turn on, you always wish you had more turns at the end.

Also, I am pretty certain that I am misunderstanding something about the action cards and/or the building blocks. Will have to read a bit on bgg to find out more. The rules seem rather vague.

Fine building game where players fight for the best spots and cities, but I'm not sold. It can be tricky, you have to watch everyone else, but there's isn't enough meat to it.

There is nothing exactly wrong with this game, but there is nothing particularly right about it either.  The Hols der Geir mechanism of players with the same hand trying to maximize value on the margins seems tired here.  The scoring advances like church and grey tiles are too speculative.  The gold cards can make or break you, but are totally random.  It was not an experience I would seek out again.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (September 2016)

I bought the game because I really liked the cover for some reason :D. When I was reading the rules, I thought the game was going to be a good area control game with some tense decisions, but I couldn’t be more mistaken :(, the game was very boring for us.

The rules are easy to read and easy to teach. You can do it under 8 minutes. Playtimes is relatively fast (its main strength).

The theme can be interesting, but it is barely there.

The game components are very well done and they look gorgeous on the table.

The decisions needed in the game aren’t obvious, but aren’t that hard either. Timing is everything because when you play a card you cannot play it again until you recover all your cards. I was expecting a meatier game, but it is rather light. Besides that, something else is missing because the game is very boring. It didn’t engage us and all players wanted to finish it soon.

The first player will draw an extra card each turn, this action carries a lot of uncontrollable luck in it and there is no way to mitigate it, a huge minus for me in a, supposedly, strategy game.

Bottom line, Flandern 1302 promised a good euro experience, but it lacks something (fun?), it is boring and players couldn’t care less about the game. It really disappointed me. My desire to play it again is very low and I just sold the game. Way too long for what it offers.

[2007.Jan.17] Area-control game with hand management concepts. Need to play again to explore further. 

[2007.May.24] An area majority (and secret action selection) game that plays rather quickly. Managing your guild's district shapes [your hand] is crucial, especially as the six cities are filled and scored in the mid- to late-game. As typical of a Queen Games production, the production is high quality and the artwork is quite attractive. Also, as seems typical of Queen Games however, the English-language rulebook could have been written/translated better; some important information is covered/mentioned only in examples and/or image captions. Overall, however, this game seems to be rather under appreciated by the community (in my opinion).

Simultaneous actions (with 3 or 4 players, with 2 you alternate and have some other changes that make the game poorer) to gain area majority. Each player may play his own pieces or "neutral ones".

What a pleasant surprise - from a quick glance through the rules, I was expecting this to be rather bland and unoriginal in spite of being pretty, but looking more closely and actually playing it has put this on my want list. While it is yet another influence game, the placement rules and simultaneous planning allow for a good bit of strategy and, more importantly, opportunities to screw with other players' strategies.
Played 5 times.

Interesting game.  I can see it getting repeat play, but it will most likely never become anyone's favorite.  While very nice-looking, play itself is a bit on the bland side, with no real excitement.  It's basically a sort of racing game where the players see who can get the most pieces in optimal spots first.
I do like it and will keep it in the collection, but it will never be my first choice of what to play.

Solid, well-designed area-control game with some good puzzle-like choices.  It's got a little-bit of abstract strategy too in how you place your different tiles.  You have to be aware that you can't be first in every city so there's a bit of math (well, simple counting, mostly) involved.  The action cards really add to the game.

From Essen 2004: This one has a bit of a learning curve I think, we all kinda played it "wrong" for the first two-thirds of the game.  Yes, it's another influence game and there isn't much new with this one, but it all worked so well together.  Very balanced, almost TOO balanced.  There is this "dummy-player" aspect to the game which adds some uniqueness to it which I really liked.  I seemed to like it more than others, some thought it was just "okay."  Maybe it's cause I won!?  I dunno, I was all excited about it but the other mediocre opinions made me wonder.

Finely crafted, very enjoyable but fairly straight-forward area control game, with an interesting 'dummy player' element. Scores well on interaction. Although the theme is not strong, I can't help thinking that some of those who gave this game a very low rating may have missed a rule or two.

I may revise my rating down to 5 after a second play. I was disappointed - normally I like Wolfgang Panning's games.

--Nov2006-- (After one 2p play.)  Quite a harmless little game of area majority with constrained placement.  I'd be happy to try a few more plays with different numbers of players.  On the other hand, there are other games - and other area majority games - that I prefer.

Obtained in trade for a hypothetical schooner of cold beer. A basically solid but slightly fiddly tactical area control game. 

Interestingly, the 2P game is a deterministic perfect information game, and may be more appealing than the main game to players of abstracts.

RATING: 3
Very boring game. Excruciatingly boring. Of all the area influence games I've played this might just be the worst. There's just no interesting mechanism to make it even remotly worth playing over games. I might be convinced to play it again just to further explore the mechanic of removing tiles, but I'd have to be very desperate to play a game the day I'm persuaded  to do that.

Chaotic game of majorities with luck everywhere and bland mechanics. Some of them don't make even sense.  Besides, the theme is not only pasted on, but wrongly picked.

a little complicated at the start with the many different pieces, but the game play is easy to pick up once you get it. A very strategic game with neutral pieces bearing subtle implications for your opponents. Deserves a much higher rating. Beautiful components!

I can see how people weren't wow'ed by this when it first came out.  There is nothing overwhelmingly exciting about it.  Sure, it is yet another area majority game.  With that in mind there are a number of things that I like.  First, I enjoy the constraints of the cards and timing when you need to pick your hand back up.  Second, I like the way the tiles interact, there are a number of worthwhile decisions in how you manage to get all your pieces out while making best use of them.  Third, I like the neutral tiles to manipulate scoring. 

I love the dynamic of pushing out your heavy control pieces yet by doing so you block yourself off in a large section of the town.  As winning tiebreakers is drastically important, this game really forces you to use your pieces in a crafty manner. I think this is a nice decent Euro.  Certainly one that has gotten a bad rap for no good reason.

A whacky, area control game with some unique tiles and features. The game revealed itself about half way through and I suspect it is a bit deeper than we initially gave it credit for. I especially like the economy of tiles aspect. Would like to play again with four players. However, I do think there is a problem with the turn order. Going last, I never got the same amount of special cards as everyone else and it hurt me at the end.

RATING: 6.5
A decent area control game, where you play cards to decide which cities to affect.  An interesting mechanic is that you must waste a turn to get back your cards which decide where you can play; however, it seems that the action list is a bit too tight to create good differentation, and as such, likely to drop rating to 6 after further plays.

Just another collection of mechanics.  It works, but doesn't add anything exciting for the table.

RATING: 5
Played with four and we all ran out of influence towards the end.  Either we played incorrectly or, to me, that is a flaw.  The endgame didn't pack much of a punch as a result.  Plays fairly fast and could be  more fun with more influence.  As it stands now, I wouldn't recommend it.

I've played this twice and I get the feeling there OUGHT to be a cool game in there but all we found was an ordinary game that didn't give you a lot of decisions to make.

RATING: 4
Uninspiring area majority game. Everbody will control their own district and only towards the end will players start to interact with each other. The special cards are very unbalanced; a lucky draw can determine the winner, regardless of skillful play. 
There are so many better games in this genre.

Although I'm beyond tired of the "simultaneous guess" mechanism, the variation on it here actually makes it feel fresh.  Each player has an identical set of cards and picks one to play on each turn, but one of the cards is a "pick up all cards played so far" card so that it's a flow thing, not simply every choice being available to every player on every turn.  The halfbricking (which we hope we have understood more or less correctly) is also a nice innovation, and the constraints on placement via geometry (very pretty geometry, incidentally) work nicely.  So, yes, it is yet another area control game... but it's one with its own flavor and which I look forward to playing again.

Hmmm why is this game rated so low? It's as good a medium-length area control game that I know.
The theme's slightly loose but not intrusive, and the gameplay seems good. There are genuine choices to make every turn and it's well paced, with a couple of unusual mechanics in there (neutral player and starting player bonus card).
So unsure what's not to like. I assumed that for a score like this the game would have a very broken element, but it really doesn't. It's good fun with everyone actively involved all the time and rattles along quite nicely.

RATING: 6
Interesting and quick. Players, however, have pretty limited options and luck on the card draws can make or break things, keeping this one firmly in the "good but not great" category.

I am from "Flandern" Belgium, so i was geographically pushed to own this game :-) No, I don't know how much Puerto-Ricans has got a copy of "the world's greatest game" so far ;-)
Good game, no more no less, except luck drawing "Gold cards" can have too much influence on this otherwise strategic game. Nice components.

Game was me simply boring. This is because most of the time playing felt  very straight-forward and there just wasn't any true decisions. Winner was decided just in couple of very important rounds. Also it is important to get right additional cards, when it is your turn to get one. There is nothing broken in this game, but I just feel that there is not much to play. This opinion is based only for one game, so it can change.

I've played 4 times now and am really enjoying this. It is the kind of game that my group seems to enjoy, and even though we are tiring of simultaneous declaration,  this works fine. I'm raising my rating .5 point from my initial rating. My understanding is this will not be available in an English version.

Bought this for my son at age 4, he digs it for awhile but I'm wondering why I didn't just by the much larger version. Skip this and go for that, not because this is worse from a gameplay but because it's just less tactile.

Dexterity game. Friends like it. We try to come up with different variants to make the game more interesting. "Free for all" - who can stack X number of animals the fastest. Alligator roll = spin it 360 degrees, etc. Good filler game.

RATING: 6
Very tiny, so perfect for travel. However, not conducive to airplane, car, or train play due to the vehicle movement. The dice is the biggest item in the box hahah! Haven't tried it but might be possible to fit all the pieces into a candy/mint tin. 

In my opinion the pieces are too small for young children who may not yet have the dexterity (or patience) for the extra precision required. For young children, go for the full size game.

I bought this game as it was very cheap and as we like Animal Upon Animal. As it turns out, this game for 2 players is just not that interesting. There are too few pieces to make it exciting. The pieces are very small and is probably good for children (as grown up-hands are much clumsier…), but I definitely prefer the original AoA, even with 2. Oh, and the pieces weren’t as cute as in the original game.

I didn't realize I had the tiny version until I saw someone else's. Their's was so much bigger than mine.  I wanted to play with theirs.  But I can't just get rid of mine and get a bigger one. I guess I'm stuck with what I've got.

RATING: 6
Interesting addition to the base game for two players. The pieces being so small makes them difficult to stack anything on them. It is a shame they are not printed upon on side like the others.....but I do have a sharpie

Ordered this version used unintentionally; I didn't realize that it was the small but great variant.  It's OK, but I would have preferred the 'chunkier' version for both my hands and my daughter's!

With my big fingers and the tiny, light animals, this one is actually more difficult for me than the original!  I bought a second set to allow 4P.  At the price (and potential for lost pieces), I might get a third...

A surprising amount of game for its size, but (for adult gamers) plays itself out pretty quickly. I keep looking for variants to make it more challenging.

I mean, it's a total delight. So tiny! And yet.

This is more a review for the company (Haba) than the game.

Played this 3-4 years ago at a church game night, and it got me hooked on Haba (a German company that sells high quality innovative kids games in generally bright yellow boxes).  Most of these Haba games are super inventive, fast to play, and give 10 minutes of quick fun after dinner or whenever.

This is essentially Animal Upon Animal: Travel Edition.

Fun enough, but not as good as its big brother. First game seemed too easy (No one capsized the structure at all).

The pieces were smaller than I thought they would be which really does diminish the playability of the game.

Components are almost too small - have issues with how light they are...and can also slide out of place pretty easily on a smooth surface.

I got this to have a good game to play with my little cousin, when we are at my grandfathers place. She loved the games and the little animals.


I think this game is fun and a challenge for the little kids. So as an older player with the child I would suggest trying to play with a little handycap for the older player like playing with the wrong hand etc. Otherwise I'd just beat my cousin all the time, but like that she has a chance. maybe in future games she will get better and beat me without handycap

Very nice and funny. I've bought additionnal wooden animals (Cannes game festival in France) to increase the challenge.
Strangely, the kids do not like it as I do... maybe because I'm winning so often... ;-)

RATING: 4
Barely playable, it's just too small, the pieces are not heavy enough and thus just slide.
It's nice to have the game in a pocket format but it's just not for overactive kids (loves the larger game though... this one too but only because we cheat for him).

Animal Upon Animal is, from what I know, the most successful game from HABA, a German company that produces wooden toys and games. Animal Upon Animal revolves around stacking wooden animals upon the back of a crocodile, with the goal being to get rid of all your animals before your opponent. 

Animal Upon Animal: Small and Yet Great, is the miniature version of this, were the crocodile, which in the normal game is maybe ten inches long, is now only one inch long, and the animals are different than in the base game, and it's just zany and fun.

Pocket sized Animal Upon Animal.  Just the right number of animals to be a good 2 player filler.  The pieces are quite small and it can be difficult if no crocodile is rolled.  Good game and cheap too.  Totally worth it.

Not mindblowing, but far from terrible, and with very cute wood pieces.  Strategy is non-existent, but it's a decent away to while away a few minutes.

The meeple sized version of Tier Auf Tier, intended for 2p only but so cheap you can buy another copy and combine it for 4p! So I did! Thanks to the Instagram folks for posting about it.

Fun miniature version of the base game. It makes a great addition to your regular set. I don't know why it only comes with six animals per player, instead of the usual seven, nor why they decided to make it a two player game only.

This is the travel edition of the game Animal upon Animal. Only 2 players, so ideal to take it on a trip for us. I can imagine that people have critics on this game. One is absolutely right if he says that the starting player has an huge advantage for winning this game. He is right when he says there are no tactics involved in this game. He would be right if he says that it is a kids game. But that person is forgetting one thing: Aren’t we all big kids? Who cares about winning a game? Can’t we just have fun with a game?

First question is clear, inside every person there always will stay a kid. Maybe when playing a kids game, the adult kid will pop up every once and a while. Second question. As Knizia said: “when playing a game, the goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning.” We can only agree with this line. Third and last question. Isn’t that what a game is about. Having fun with each-other? And this game will provide 10 minutes of fun. It’s easy, it’s fast and it’s pure fun. What does a big kid wants more every now and then?

O wait… I know, play a big game after this one.

It's much better than Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. The cases make much more sense and I love the "campaign" nature of the game. The scoring & time track are also MUCH better.

My one problem is that there exist two versions of this game, an 8 and 9 case version. Didn't realize this until buying (most major games stores seem to carry the 8 case one anyway) and now I cannot play the last case without buying the whole game again.

RATING: 6
Case 1 : Good.  On the easy side.  Prefer the theme and fell of SHCD.

Case 2 : A step up in difficulty.  Another good case.

Case 3 : This one was pretty easy and more story driven, but still quite fun.

Case 4 :  A brilliant idea marred by poor execution with way to many errors to be enjoyable.

Case 5 : Either this case is broken or I just didn't get it...

Case 6 : This case was more work than fun for me. This case feels like it needs a re-edit or overhaul.

Case 7 : The best case so far.  Glad I persevered with this game.  Creepy, atmospheric, engrossing.  More story driven than mystery driven (that is neither a good thing nor a bad thing) and finally delivers the potential for this theme/game system that the previous cases didn't.

Case 8 :  A fairly weak final case.  Now, just the 'extra' case left.

Case 9 (Prologue) : A pretty good final case.  One of the better cases for sure.

Final Thoughts :  I dislike the requirement cards and supplemental encounters if there are too many in a case.  They are great in theory, but make the game more work in practice and take away from the gameplay.  Used sparingly, they are fine.

Too many errors mar a couple of cases (4 and 6 in particular).  While some errors are forgivable and even expected in this kind of game, I bought this to play, I didn't pay to be a play-tester.  I'm wondering how much this was play-tested given the large number of glaring/game-breaking errors.  The errata, which I printed from BGG, is 7 pages!

I've settled on 6 for my rating.  Some cases were awesome, some good and a few broken/not enjoyable.  Therefore, very hard to provide an overall rating.

This is basically the same game as Sherlock Holmes Cosulting Detective with the storyline located in H.P. Lovecraft’s Arkham. The main difference with the two games is that in Mythos Tales you track the night and day as the game progresses. Moreover, Mythos Tales comes with a question sheet that you are expected to answer after playing the whole campaign.  As of this writing I am yet to play the all the scenarios but the start has been really solid. At least I was able to immerse myself into the world of Cthulhu and my mind has been occupied by the story for a couple of days after playing. The art and the writing in the game have been great so far which definitely helps with bringing the theme to life.

Some complaints though:
1)	There are quite a few errors and misprints in the map and in the Directory of Arkham, which can be devastating for the experience. You better print the official errata.
2)	The extra question sheet you get with the game should have been sealed within an envelope. The questions give away interesting locations you’d otherwise disregard at the beginning of the game.

Despite the flaws, I personally enjoy playing the game very much and would recommend it to anyone. Rules are extremely simple to teach. You just tell everyone that you are supposed to collect clues and evidence from the material supplied with the game. Everything has to be done within a limited amount of turns after which you are to answer a number of questions to see how well you did. 

Could be played solo but I reckon 2-3 players is the best number. With 4+ players, the debate over where to go and what to do can become quite heated and it will lengthen the game.

Clone of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, set in the Arkham Lovecraftian universe.  Game is "out there" regarding the occult and the supernatural but is entertaining.  As is the case with SHCD, don't expect to win very often as Professor Armitage, the Sherlock Holmes in this game, always figures things out much easier than you will ever do.  

I play the game solo, but I have played SHCD with others and that is the best part of the game ... the discussions among players.  However, it is fun to pair off and see who scores best.  

Not a game for kids ... I would highly advise against playing with kids under the age of 13.

Mythos Tales is Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective transferred to the world of H.P. Lovecraft, with a few tweaks to the system.  The deadline is little more than a visible reminder that Armitage (the Sherlock of Mythos) is speeding to a solution and so you need to remain focused.  Scoring is a bit more more nuanced and I like the deductions for sanity loss.   The requirement cards might be Mythos' best innovation.  They cut down the deductive leaps that sometimes happen in Consulting Detective when you stumble across a significant location.  Don't have the evidence required to understand the significance of this place?  Move along, nothing to see.   

A hefty negative is that the errata for this game currently stands at six pages, covering the first seven of nine cases.  8th Summit's proof-reading was simply inadequate.  Repeated minor frustrations have nibbled away at my enjoyment of this game.    An example:  a location in the first case refers to the Miskatonic Museum. Look it up under M in the directory - nothing.  Wait, at the back of the directory buildings are listed by function and under University (Miskatonic) there's...no museum.  Think to look under Local Culture and you will find the University Exhibit Museum, which is the place referred to by another name.

People have commented that the puzzles Mythos Tales sets are less demanding than those of Consulting Detective.  Certainly the early cases are join the dots deduction.  The sixth case tries something more ambitious, with events unfolding and different things to be found at some locations on different days and times.  The result is frankly a mess.  The nonsensical sequence of locations that Armitage visits to solve this one is the cherry on a half-baked cake. 

Production quality is good.  The artwork doesn't really bring Arkham to life.

RATING: 7.5
Mythos is the love child of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective and H.P. Lovecraft.

The game is not a proper game, but more an activity: there are no rules, and players must visit various places to solve a mystery.
The key differences between Mythos and Sherlock are the supernatural element, and an internal clock that forces players to rush towards a solution.

Cases appear more straightforward than in SH, but somewhat engaging anyway.

The italian edition makes a good job separating the cases in small booklets, but loses the bigger map of its english counterpart.
The translation incorporates the errata (fixing the quibbles of the english edition), but is a bit shorter of being top-notch.

Kickstarter Edition (includes 9th case)
Unfortunately I couple of the cases have case-breaking mistakes.  An errata is now available on this website.
It is disappointing that in those broken cases, the solution could never be achieved if the developers had played with the version that we played with - which suggests that they weren't thoroughly proof-read.

Other than that, I found the cases very enjoyable (even the ones that couldn't be properly solved).  The requirement rule adds something that I wish Sherlock had had (the ability to go to a lead with extra knowledge gleaned from working on the case).

After finishing case 5 I have revised my rating. As much as I love the theme and the storylines the errors make the play incredibly frustrating at times. I loved the first 2 scenarios, so far the later ones are either go around in circles trying to figure out a clue or read the errata first and know some answers before starting play.

I haven't played Sherlock so can't compare, but I found the story to be uninteresting and the decisions ridiculously obvious.

And sooo many typos.

Playing the first case was pretty fun. But after we finished it we were almost a bit disappointed.
The solution was pretty vague and the time limit was somehow harsh.
After knowing what we had to know it didn't seem like there was a way to get this in one runthrough in the given time.

Hopefully it gets better in the second case. Otherwise I have to lower my rating.

This is exactly as described - it's Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (newspaper and all) but set in Arkham unraveling mysteries concerning the Mythos. Cthulhu and the boys wreaking havoc while you fall into the text and get lost in the story.

It's interesting playing this system again post TIME Stories. I prefer TIME stories slightly (as it feels slightly more alive due to interacting with the different elements of the scene), but the story here is stronger and this game is still extremely interesting.

I do think I prefer this to SHCD (setting is more interesting here), but Gumshoe still is king.

The production quality is a terrible disappointment. The map looks too modern and euro-game like. The choice of paper is too glossy, especially for an old-style newspaper!

We have played most of the scenarios. So cool to play a Lovecraft game where you run away from things and try to avoid bad stuff. Lots of atmosphere, very Lovecraftian adventures, a few exciting passages. The scenarios have multiple authors, so they vary in quality, but the best stand toe to toe with Consulting Detective. The emphasis seems t be more on story than mystery in most of them, but we have had a great time.

This is a very faithful adaptation of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective into H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham, with Dr. Henry Armitage replacing Holmes.  It works in much the same way with a series of mystery episodes collected in a hardcover book with customized clues for various locations you visit, a map of Arkham, a directory, and a list of helpful people to consult.  You're trying to solve the mystery in as few stops as possible in order to do better than Armitage.

RATING: 8
I backed the Kickstarter version. Mythos Tales is a Lovecraftian-themed version of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. [Independently produced, so not an offshoot of the Ystari/Asmodee reboots of the Chessex sets from the mid-1980's].

Mythos Tales is set in 1930's Arkham instead of Victorian London. In these mysteries your Sherlock Holmes surrogate is Professor Henry Armitage at Miskatonic University. Armitage introduces you to each case and if you're lucky, a lead or two to follow. 

Gameplay will be familiar to SHCD players such that one could open the contents and play immediately: go to the relevant locations and read their corresponding entries in the book. When enough clues are gathered, players can turn to the back of the case and answer a series of questions, gaining points for each correct answer. Some questions are related to the mystery, others are bonus "side quest" details you may or may not have encountered. 

Points are then assessed based on how many turns you took (i.e. visited locations); too many turns deducts from your score, and not sussing out the mysteries in the case before the turn limit also results in lower scores. In SHCD the default "beat Holmes" score was always 100 points. In this game it's not necessary to beat your colleague Armitage, but they do give you a point scale as to what a "winning" score would be. [A lower score may mean that you fell prey to the eldritch horrors in Arkham or went insane and are committed to Arkham Sanitarium].

You'll find the usual Consulting Detective props in the box: a beautiful, hardcover casebook containing eight cases that has the heft and weight of an old-school Dungeons and Dragons manual. [In Ystari's version, each case is a separate, soft-cover pamphlet; only the introductory case in Mythos Tales is in this format]. There's also a gridlike map of Arkham with coordinates on building and locations that may likely correspond to an entry in one of the cases; an Arkham Directory that's a combination white pages of people listings and a yellow pages section in the back with commercial or government buildings listed alphabetically. There are also a sheaf of double sided copies of the local Arkham papers, with each one dated to correspond with a specific case. The newspapers have photos, ads, personals, and news items that often contain vital clues or foreshadow future cases. All of these are similar to SHCD.

MT does add some fun wrinkles to gameplay that are eldritch-adjacent and thematic to fit the Lovecraft universe. Sherlock fans will not be familiar with them but will easily be able to incorporate them. 

One new feature is a timetrack grid that lists seven days, separated by a Morning, Afternoon, and Night section for each day. An hourglass chit and red X chit are used with the timetrack.  This is similar to SHCD only here it's made explicit. In SHCD one would keep track of their moves on a sheet of paper and tally them at the end. Here you still list your moves, but now there's a grid and counters that track time.

Armitage, in explaining a case's particulars, will sometimes tell you how long you have to solve the case. So [for example] if he says "I suspect you should have this wrapped up in five days," then you place the red X "deadline" counter on the Day 5/Evening box. Essentially, you'd have 5 days x 3 sections per day = 15 moves to solve the case. Using the hourglass, players slide their time token from section to section for each separate entry in the book that is visited. 

Timekeeping is also different than SHCD in that 1) MT entries that "don't exist" (aka you go somewhere and there's no entry for that location in the case) DO count as spent turns, though you do get to choose another location immediately (and spend another time turn in so doing). And 2) revisits to the same location DO count twice.

Presumably you can fail the proposed deadline, but for each move past the deadline you incur point deductions towards your final score. 

Another new feature are numbered cards. The cases include certain locations where investigators could acquire a numbered card - they will be told to do so in the entry itself. Taking a made-up example: "If you have Card 3 refer to special encounter #7." Each case has a page of special encounters that can only be visited if the investigators have the corresponding card and are instructed to go there. 

These cards and the special encounters that they unlock represent crucial clues, artifacts, or core pieces of evidence that may help them when visiting other future locations to unlock additional information - or ***even save their lives!***

Yes, one shift in Mythos Tales is that, being Arkham, one can perish or go insane investigating.  Finding the truth is not always safe! In this manner Mythos Tales is much more "Choose Your Own Adventure," or "Time Stories" with a premature ending requiring you to start the case again. 

The 8 cases are standalone but also loosely connected by the Cthulhu mythos, so there can be a mild campaign aspect to it when playing with the same group. Knowledge gained in previous cases build on future ones. In fact, the designers stress that the clues and information in Case #8 will seem impenetrable/unreadable if Cases #1-7 haven't first been experienced, and they suggest that players go through the case book in order. 

If you love Consulting Detective, then these 8 cases (plus a ninth introductory case) are a welcome addition to this style of game playing. If you are a fan of storytelling, RPG-boardgame hybrids like Time Stories, you would also enjoy Mythos Tales. It goes without saying that if you love all things Lovecraft and Cthulhu, that this is a must-play. It would also be a superb gateway experience if you are introducing players to RPG's. I'm using Mythos Tales as a gateway introductory experience for our group's Trail of Cthulhu RPG campaign, since the "Gumshoe" system is investigative and clue-based, just as MT is.

This game is excellent when using the errata. The errata are also the only reason this doesn't receive a 10 - while I can understand some errors, there are too many.

Update: I've since cooled on this. The early cases are excellent and exciting, and then Case 4 happened. Extremely boring fetch quest where you achieved nothing at all. Case 5 was better, but still not quite engaging. If case 6 doesn't do enough to peak interest for me, I might just sell this.

RATING: 2
There is really no excuse for the number of errors in this game. Thanks to misspellings, misprints, wrong directions, and an ENTIRE MISSING PAGE (thrown in as an extra bit of paper), I needn't nitpick the clues themselves to criticise this game.

Bizarrely, the best-written story segment in the entire game was in a non-vital location, and its exciting happenings were not even hinted at in the bonus questions.

It's nice to see an attempt to build upon Consulting Detective, but the requirement cards were the only new game mechanic that was ever used well, and this doesn't begin to make up for the major flaws present.

I'd strongly recommend avoiding this game.

RATING: 6.5
Ok game. Would have been better without the frequent errors in the directory/map. The "requirement card" mechanism just contributes to more frustration than immersion. Some cases seem to rely to heavily on it, which makes it really hard if you visit locations in the wrong order or wrong time.

This is an outstanding gaming experience. Suitable for smaller groups or solo it's in the exact vein as Sherlock Holmes Consuting Detective but in the fully fleshed out and realized town of Arkham. Thanks to author Will for his thoughtful FAQ which is a must, but the naysayers and crabbers are wrong. This game is completely playable and totally enjoyable; as long as you like the theme and choose your own adventure style.

I absolutely love this game! My best friend got it for me and the first time we played, we sat down and played through the first three scenarios. Lots of deduction and a good amount of horror. Very similar to Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective but has a few different elements in it that make it easier and shorter to play. Also introduces a card/item system that makes it a bit more interesting.

This deduction adventure is much more a social experience than a game. Solving the crime requires a bit too much blind assumption and scoring mechanism is immaterial. Still, there is something to be said about wandering around Arkham in the 1920's, tracking down clues, and trying to fit it all into a logical narrative.

Not a game in a traditional sense.  It's a deductive narrative story mixed with a school read an article and answer a question exercise.

You're moving around a large map of Arkham and trying to understand all the aspects of a case in the time allotted before answering questions to see how many you get and see how you score.

On the pros side, the narrative is great, I love the idea of solving a mystery and seeing what we can figure out, it's a lovecraft themed version of the sherlock holmes mysteries games

On the negative side, you do need to download the errata for this game because there is typos in various cases, some which are merely annoying, but a couple that could easily screw you up (buildings numbered incorrectly).  

Also this is a game where you have to flip through a book to look up a building number and see if there is anything written there to read, this is easily a mechanic that would be better suited to an app since it will prevent any accidental glancing at other entries.  If I could find the book in digital form, i'd set this up for my GF and myself when we play.

This is also a fun experience for setting mood up for it while you play.  My GF and I have set up candles and put midnight syndicate on in the background while we've played this to be deeper in the theme for more fun.

I really enjoy this style of game. The only other game I know like it is Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. Solving the mystery is so exciting and I like the way Mythos Tales incorporates a Lovecraft theme and adds a time element to the game, which makes different locations have different stories depending on the time of day you arrive. Very cool take on the style.

Similar to: Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. (NEED the Errata)

Welcome to H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham in the 1920s. There will be many mysteries to uncover in this storytelling game of Lovecraftian terror. Using the provided newspaper, a list of allies, the directory of Arkham residents, and a map of Arkham, your job is to follow the clues from location to location, suspect to suspect, to unravel the mystery and answer the questions posed at the end of each scenario.

Played through all campaigns with friends. Have to say, the game is incredibly buggy. Bad or missing clues, missing locations on the map, incredible leaps in logic that no one could see coming. We were able to finish, but we needed to follow house rules about what counted or didn't count as a location spent in the latter half of the adventures, as the bugginess seemed a lot worst in the second half of the campaign.

Compared to Sherlock from the similar SHCD games, Armitage is more of a comrade.  I enjoyed the characters and Cthulu atmosphere just a bit more.  The added item cards and time limit were great rules.  I find these cases were fairly easy, but they still made me think.  I wish the newspapers and map felt older; they're instead shiny bright white and glossy respectively, but that's fairly minor.  I hope that more cases are written as expansions.

I've only played the 1st case so far, but I absolutely loved it! I ended up playing through twice. Once as a co-investigator with my hubby. The second time I acted as the reader and let a friend play through. It was just as much fun watching someone else explore the world. 
I actually enjoyed the mechanics of this game slightly more than Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. The time tracker adds a sense of urgency, and the rule that you cannot revisit a location without counting it against your time encouraged me to pay closer attention to details and keep careful notes. The theme was a bit more fun for me than SHCD as well, but that is personal preference. Love the artwork too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not much of a game, per se, but a very enjoyable experience all the same. I'm surprised they didn't include components to take notes, but otherwise this is a great production that eases players into this genre without dropping them off in the deep end like Consulting Detective does. I rate this higher than Consulting Detective both because I like the theme better and because there is a lot less fluff to sort through. You get just enough direction that you aren't totally in the dark, but after awhile you will have to think outside the box to do well on the cases. I also like that this version includes the time track and time-specific events.

Please start working on an expansion if you haven't already, 8th Summit!

Great game with some clever ideas and a real sense of experiencing Lovecraft's (as opposed to FFG's) vision of Arkham.  You are not hunting reams of monsters - rather you must concentrate on finding out what is going on.  Unfortunately, the numerous annoying errors do tend to distract and annoy.  Some very good atmospheric cases are undermined by errors.... but even so I still rate it an 8.

[Edit]
Dropped to 7 as sometimes it feels like the clues are a bit random.

RATING: 5
Tldr: Don’t buy it unless they do an errata’s second edition.

Warning: As far as I can remember nothing below will "spoiler" anything in the cases, and there's no specific specific examples given, but I suppose the meta-discussion may affect your enjoyment of the game. The problem is the errata you have to use to proceed (particularly in cases 4 and 6) actually does more to spoil the game than anything I've said below.

My wife and I have been playing Mythos Tales and have completed the first 7 cases. At the end of Case 6 - The Star of Tokelau I went back and angrily changed my rating of it from an 8 (“Very good - enjoy playing and would suggest it.”) to a 5 (“Mediocre - take it or leave it.”). Here’s why:

Mythos Tales is an investigation game very much in the vein of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective which, in turn, is kind of a descendent of the old “choose your own adventure” books. You go to a location, scan for clues in the text for where to visit next and occasionally get given key “items” that unlock more when you go to a specific location. You get a map, a directory, and a book of story entries for those locations. There’s a mentor, Professor Armitage, who sets the case up and then at the end goes through it with you and shows you (his) “perfect route” through the clues. There are many reviews of it available if you want to read more about how it works in theory.

After Case 3: The King Cometh I rated it an 8 and was really enjoying it.
The first two missions were quite simple, but I liked where it was going (and my wife loved it), the third I really enjoyed but I was starting to get worried. We had noticed things missing from the map and had assumed this was deliberate and tried to guess them from further investigation and deduction. We had problems with people’s testimonies but put that down to unreliable witnesses. Finally, I didn’t see how Armitage managed his investigation. It almost seemed like he cheated but I wasn’t going to read through all the entries to find out – it felt like it would ruin the suspension of disbelief.

By Case 5: The Serpent’s Vengeance we knew the game was riddled with mistakes. We were using errata from BGG provided by fans and one of the designers (note: nothing official from the publisher) and, for me, this was ruining the engagement with the game.

Case 6 was a shambles. Errors in the text and we had clear evidence that Armitage cheated – it was impossible for him to complete it in the way he did. We even went through and cross referenced every entry – that wasn’t the only part that was actively impossible!

I didn’t want to play again and was only persuaded on the condition that we didn’t even look at Armitage’s solution. As it turns out, Case 7 was much better but we’re now at the “end” of the semi-official errata and I’m not willing to do another one when I now have so little confidence in the quality control of the product.
I want to like Mythos Tales, it is great in concept and interesting in development but I’m very disappointed in the publishers - 8th Summit. They’ve clearly released a game that was not ready for market, without adequate quality control and are making no effort to fix what they have done. It has ruined their reputation for me.

Interesting concept of a game and I enjoyed the Cthulhu Mythos being used.  Still, it's more of a tabletop game like DnD than a board game (which isn't what I was expecting, but isn't exactly bad either).  I didn't like that the first mystery didn't really have a clear endpoint as to when you solved the case.  We were trying to find and apprehend the one suspect before finally giving up only to realize that we were only meant to gather clues to answer questions at the end.

This is a fun game that I would rate higher if it had any replay-ability.

The intricacies of the game are amazing, great attention to detail, a fun challenge, and wonderful table talk. Everyone can contribute on every turn. The game is even better when you have players who are willing to try a little bit of voice acting.

(Rating based on solo play) I've enjoyed the mechanics so far, and I like the Cthulhu theme more than Sherlock Holmes, but a game like this lives and dies on the writing...and it's just not that strong in Mythos Tales. Lovecraft was himself already prone to repetition and unintentional self-parody, but the game doesn't even successfully capture that atmosphere. Compared to the encounters in Arkham Horror (which flirt with camp but I think are much closer to Lovecraft in quality), the writing is just limp.

This is a mystery solving game in the same style as Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. The general idea is there's a choose your own adventure book, and players take turns deciding who to talk to and where to go. When you think you've solved the mystery, the book asks you questions about the case, and you score based on how well you can answer the questions minus points for wrong turns you made. The game was fun, and introduced some nice mechanisms beyond that you find in Sherlock, for example, this game might give you a different encounter text based on if you have an item or not, or even what time of day it is. On the other hand, the text passages aren't quite as well written in Sherlock. In Sherlock, the person you meet will give you some piece of information, and then you need to figure out what to do with it, without much guidance. In Mythos, so far anyway, guy A tells you to go see guy B, who tells you that you really should talk to guy C.

Another difference is that Sherlock lets you walk around talking to people, accumulating negative points as you go, as long as you want to. Mythos has a fixed timer. This is an interesting element, but it does make me feel like I'm missing out on plot, and it sort of seems like a crutch to compensate for the different investigation paths being too straightforward. I'm tempted to say, we should just ignore the timer in future plays and just take negative points beyond a certain point?

Lovecraftian Mythos Mystery Solving!  Very much like a Call of Cthulhu RPG light, or Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective plumbing the mysteries Man was not meant to know.

 There is no way around it, but this game is derivative. For all intents it is someone making their own themed version of Consulting Detective. I am mostly OK with that. I do like the rule tweaks introduced. I like the added tension the time tracker adds, and I much prefer the scoring system of this game over Consulting Detective. I have not played all of the cases (yet), but I really love the story telling of this game. It has a great pulp feel. It captures the theme and mystery so very well. A final plus is that the components are really, really nice.

This is basically a reskin of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with some minor improvements.  Yet, the reskin and minor improvements make this a much better game.

Everything you know and love from Sherlock is still here - the newspaper, the map, following up on leads, etc.  But there are some key improvements in Mythos Tales:

1) Professor Armitage isn't a douche.  Sherlock often made absurd leaps in logic and solved crimes in a fashion that no reasonable person would do.  He made huge, unfounded assumptions that he always happened to be right about.  Because of this, I always felt annoyed when reading the solution because there was no way to actually "beat Sherlock".  Professor Armitage makes reasonable decisions and reading through his recap makes sense.

2) No errors (so far).  Sherlock had some unfortunate typos that could really screw up the case.  Also, some of the addresses were different in one book versus another (it was like E in one book meant N in another), and that was incredibly distracting.  Mythos Tales is cleaner.

3) Sequence matters.  In Mythos Tales you often get information that is represented by a card, and other locations will only be useful if you have that card.  For example, if you learn about a secret cult they might tell you to take card 1.  Then, if you go to the occult researcher, he will only tell you something if you have card 1.  It's simple, but really nice.

4) The theme fits perfectly.  Sherlock is fine, but the mysteries are mundane - murders, thefts, scandals.  Mythos tales brings in Cthulhu, so magic and evil allows for more interesting mysteries (highly subjective, of course).  One of my favorite aspects is that you can get attacked and suffer horror by going to certain locations (or going to those locations at the wrong time).  And some of the clues are written such that you can't totally trust what you are seeing.  This all comes together in a way that really works for me.

If you like the concept of SH:CD and aren't turned off by the Cthulhu theme, this game is for you.

theMCGuiRE review takes a look at Mythos Tales from 8th Summit.  This is a story driven game with a horror feel straight from the H.P. Lovecraft's universe!  You will work as a team or alone to solve the crimes one by one trying to outwit Professor Henry Armitage and get the best most efficient score possible.  The game is super fun and travels well if you are on the go.  So if you are looking for an adventure and you don't mind chasing down monsters from the deep, look no further than Mythos Tales!

RATING: 9.5
[thing=126100][/thing] is the younger brother of [thing=2511][/thing] and, likewise, is an unusual game.

First, the amount of rules: read the introduction of the case. Now, go wherever you want whenever you want (following the map by using the Directory, which contains the adresses of everyone of interest, and also the adress of several business locations) and talk (read) with the people there. Read the newspaper of the day, if pleases you. Also, you might want to talk with some fine folks that usually are aware of things (some Allies, but it might be tricky to know which will truly help). Now, also whenever you want, you can return to present your fiddings regarding the case to Armitage. The case will contain some questions, each will be worth an amount of points. Then, for every location you went beyond the amount that Armitage did, you will lose points. Here you don't really compare the amount you achieve with that of Armitage (Holmes would always get 100 points). Yet, you can apply the same and then you can feel good or bad, depending on how well you did. And that is it. Well, less than it, actually, since my last bit of feelings is more a thing I added. That is all the rules.

In every case you will have at your disposal: the booklet of the case (you can always consulte passages you read), the newspaper, the Arkham Directory (the adress of many things and persons in Arkham) and the map of Arkham, and this one, by the way, one of the players (we played in 4 people) thought it was utterly unnecessary, since how close one thing is to other, or the relation of one to another, wasn't playing any roll in the case. But then, in the end, the game hit us hard in the nutsack for not using it properly (you know, as a map). So great.

[thing=126100][/thing] is, probably, one of the most pure experiences of playing that one can have. There is no board (the map is not a board, you don't take action on it, you use it, as I pointed out, as a reference), no meeples, no pieces, no tokens, no money, no cards, no keeping rounds (though, you can see every new location as a new round), no gameplay time as we usually time it. What there are: reading and talking. After the reading of what happened in the case we started discussing: where to go? With whom to talk? What information we had? What means this or that? What about visiting the school for girls? And after we decided to go to a place, and the reading of what occurred there, we returned to the discussions. And now what? What we take it from this? Which lines/leads we now can follow? Usually quite a few, but it was worth our time to follow most of them? Which was more likely to actually advance our case? What was the place - or the person - with the best chances of providing clues? We compared notes, explored options, created scenarios - this because of this and this. Yes... but what about [i]this[/i]? Well, [i]this[/i] I can't explain properly right now. So, which place or person would shed light on this matter? I think this one. But wouldn't he just say what we already know? Then, we can take a chance here. Yes, it can work. And things went this way during the whole game. [thing=126100][/thing] is a game of pure deduction, taking notes, clashing options.

A play of [thing=126100][/thing] ends when the players want. You can visit 10 places, 50 (if not using the time track) or two. The decisions are yours, always. You know you are "running" against Armitage, but you did not know how many places/persons he went/talked to. I doubt that in any of the cases Armitage needed to go to 50 places to solve the case, but the main question here is: which is worth more - beating Armitage or solving the case? For us it was solving the case, and only after we had a solid overall view of most of the things in the case, and a scenario that answered (for us) most of our own questions, that we went to see the end result. And this can't be taken lightly: once you read the solution of the case, you probably won't be able to ever playing it again since the challenge will be gone. There aren't any variations in the set up, nor event cards, nor different characters to take - the case will always be the same, the result will be the same, the clues will be in the same places.

So, yes, [thing=126100][/thing] has a "due date" - after the 8 cases, it is over. Except by reasons of really weak memory, disease and amnesia, even many years after playing you won't be able to fully enter a play of one of the cases (since, you might start not remembering things, but then something clicks, you remember, and now you basically can't participate). However, this is all that much important? There are lots of games I bought and probably won't clock 8 plays of them. But, more relevant, a game that gives you 8 memorable experiences? I can't, as up to right now, say that it will actually be 8 memorable experiences, but the first case was, and I doubt that the others will fall short.

The amount of work of the authors in the cases is awe inspiring - the newspaper and so many places with informations (most not relevant, but there, anyway). One thing I wished it was present in [thing=2511][/thing] I found here: an internal clock. Sometimes it matters reaching a place in the morning, afternoon or evening. This is simpy great and adds a lot both to the difficulty to the theme and consistence.

The key difference between [thing=126100][/thing] and [thing=2511][/thing] is the supernatural: it is part of the first. You must be open to consider it, to think in such a way that the occult, the Ancient Ones, the powers from beoynd the veil are true and work in mysterious ways. This make things harder to come up with solutions, as we leave the realm of usual possibilities and the "everything that is left must be true" got a whole lot bigger. Yet, the game provides enough clues for even those that aren't fans of the Mythos and Lovecraft to get to the answers - it plays fair, but sure, knowing your Mythos will help.

And [thing=126100][/thing] gives that feeling of being instrumental do fight the cosmic terrors, without actually engaging in monster fights (which bothers many that play Arkham Horror, Elder Sign, Eldrtich Horror and others) . You won't carry many shotguns or do spells here - yet, you will be able to thwart evil schemes (or, at least, be of help to Armitage).

While [thing=126100][/thing] doesn't have the originality and charm of London and Holmes, it compensates, a little, with some ingenious decisions and challenges regarding the cases. I won't spoil, but they are good! 

It was a night of talks, and exploring in our minds. We visited places, talked to people - and even going to only 14 different places, still the play lasted for almost four hours! The play reminded me of when, in college, we discussed books in the class of literary analysis - many views trying to reach an overall acceptance of the intent of the whole thing. 

Anyway, I'm totally excited to tackle the next mistery!

RATING: 5.5
An enjoyable game hindered by frankly unacceptable levels of errors and odd logic. The errata needed for this game is ridiculous and, considering it includes spoliers, hinders the enjoyment of the game as it leaves you feeling unsure if you're wasting your time as the mystery may be unsolvable without it. Clearly nobody got a proof copy before it was given the green light to print. However, if you can overlook all this then it can be enjoyable. Such a shame though.

Dust off your investigation skills for this game (if you have any). You must use your imagination as you visit various locations in Arkham, Massachusetts. It's definitely different. I think with this one, you either love it or hate it. So, if you love it, go play it. If you hate it, don't waste your time and go play what you love. ;-)

Fun and very well written. This is the best structure for a storytelling game that you can play, and no preparation is needed, which is a big plus. Literally a two minute set up, and then everyone is immersed in Arkham for the duration with no lengthy rules explanations needed. Ton of content in the box too.

Never reaches the heights of Consulting Detective and is plagued by even more typos and errors than its predecessor, and is often easier by a wide margin, but still fun and funny and interesting.

Never spooky, for better or worse, and the Arkham presented in the game seems to have normalized all the eldritch goings-on, which is kind of strange.

Really enjoy the Consulting Detective format!  I like that this game punishes you for visiting some locations so you really have to decide if it's worth the information you may obtain from a location.

Some interesting investigations, but clearly worse than Sherlock Holmes Consultive Detective. 
Also, too many errata that make some investigations unplayable.

Surprised to REALLY enjoy this one.  First case was great fun and, to me, crushed the first case from time stories.  Very impressed and looking forward to the next game!

Second game was also excellent!

Good alternative or supplement to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. Enjoyed the first case.

this is Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with a Lovecraft theme. The new time limit mechanic is good because you can't spending forever investigating, forcing you to play smart. Even though I'm dumb and can't answer half the end-of-case questions, this is a really good game.

Played this at Atlanta GameFest.  If you enjoyed solving mysteries in Call of Cthulhu (or ever played their old solitaire choose your adventure type scenaraios), then you will love this game.  Our group of seven was really engaged in the investigation we played (King Cometh) up until the very end, where it lasted a bit too long.  However, I found the scoring a little unsatisfying. I can understand losing points by ignoring clues and going on wild goose chase, but sometimes there were not any clues that would tell you a path was unproductive.  In some cases, you gained additional points for finding out information about secondary storylines while in other cases you would have been penalized for visiting locations not directly involved.  Repeatability limited to the number er of cases.

RATING: 7.57
A more thematically-grounded and more interesting take on a [I]Pandemic[/I]-like co-op.

Solid mechanics and great cooperative play with tightly integrated (if slightly depressing) theme.  Some educational value for those less familiar with the history of slavery in the U.S. 

Suffers from the same problem as all co-ops, i.e., alpha-player domination.  Plays well as a solo.  Probably the cooperative game I reach for when I play cooperatives, which is not frequently.

1st play: Disappointing. I think Co-ops are just not my thing. The theme fit the mechanics, but often when playing co-ops I feel like I'm just playing against a random shuffle of cards. This one had a bit more strategy to it, with the slavers moving around based upon my movement, but it just didn't draw me in. With all the buzz, I had hoped it would be better.

No desire to play again, just not that good.

Excellent historical game.  May get bogged down with trying to figure out actions.  Really have to concentrate on gaining maximum money to be able to purchase necessary support.  For some reason this game stresses me out and overwhelms my brain even more then pandemic.

RATING: 7
The theme for Freedom is very engrossing. Everything looks and feels spectacular. 

But then you start playing the game for awhile and realize that the 'best' moves to make will sacrifice various slaves that are coming onto the board or going to the slave catchers. It's a nasty decision where the mechanics ask you to do one thing and the theme asks you to do another. If you want to play it optimally as a game, you might have to divest yourself of some thematic immersion to look at cubes, income, and probability rather than slaves and freedom. I wish it didn't have to be like that, and it does hold my immersion back.

Another issue is the support tokens. I like the cards and action discs you buy a lot. But the $10 tokens feel like the most pointless hassle in the whole game. It's actually annoying to invest so many resources into doing 'nothing' over and over just to make the game progress and be able to win. I would like this game a lot more if those tokens were more integrated into the gameplay.

As is, Freedom does have some amazing highs and annoying lows. It's still a very interesting co-op and very unique. So overall good.

I highly recommend this game if you like coop games. Very well designed puzzle mechanism to find paths to free the slaves. Unfortunately, I don't particularly like coops. At least in this game you have some control over what the game is trying to do to defeat you. Excellent historically and handles a difficult subject very well.

RATING: 7
Freedom breaks one of my rules; the one about not enjoying fully co-op games very much.  That's all the more surprising because it is a pretty conventional puzzle. It's really a game about money; how to maintain a flow of income and how to divide it between purchasing support and moving escaped slaves. Add point to point movement of slaves from the southern plantations to Canada, with actual escape balanced against fund raising and the need to free up spaces in the plantations. This is made more interesting by a game of dodge with a set of slave catchers who react to your moves. The draw of abolitionist cards and some random movement of slave catchers add a degree of variation, though I am not sure whether it will be enough in the long term. 

Freedom is a well designed game. It plays very smoothly, generates good tension, and there isn't an ounce of fat. It's a tough puzzle to solve. Fidelity to its unusual theme is also good; I find myself fretting over the fate of every one of my little wooden cubes.

Here is another comprehensive and readable set of rules from Academy Games. The game is good looking, the artwork nicely evocative of the era. However, there are some rough edges to a production that is mostly on a par with eurogames.

I bought this game to play solo.  It works really well.  Like Pandemic Legacy and Scythe, though, I struggle to separate the game from the theme.  I've played it a few times with others and wanted to strangle them when they casually referred to the loss of a brown cube (aka, a slave) as being not a big deal.  So this game has firmly cemented itself as a solo-only game for me.  And I thoroughly enjoy it that way.

Freedom is a well designed game with easy game play and a heavy theme. This is the soul of what a good co-op ought to be. Challenging and thinky. Each round you get to do one action on the board but you feel like you need to be doing 5 at least. The problem for us was that the theme was too heavy, too immersive. And that is not a fault in the game. The historical accuracy and immersion this brings out is intense. However, when playing Pandemic it is abstracted to the point where when that outbreak happens in Jakarta I don't feel anything emotionally. In Freedom because the theme of slavery and abolition is so well represented that every time a slave catcher moves or a slave gets put back into the market we feel horrible. The slaves are abstracted by unpainted wooden cubes but that doesn't seem to help. So while this is an awesome co-op  that deserves all the accolades it has gotten, the theme is ironically too well represented. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just a fun game.  Decisions are important, challenging play, plenty of variety, and short play time.

It's hard to tell at the moment, but it doesn't seem to suffer from the "strong player makes all the decisions" problem that is characteristic of many co-ops.

Strong recommendation.

Thematically this is a winner. It abstracts things just enough to avoid offense, while maintaining an admirable sense of the importance of the enterprise. Have used effectively to teach the history of the era and its important figures and dilemmas. Gameplay is brain-burning (in a good way) and the theme keeps coming into view to keep things intense. Winning is truly satisfying!

Well done, Brian!

Comparative to other cooperative games, this is an incredibly impressive game; Immersive/unique theme, interesting decisions, outstanding components, etc.

But despite that, my apathy towards this game reflects by attitude to co-ops in general. For one, I rarely enjoy the cooperative nature in solving puzzles together... either one player dominates the decision or it drags on as players attempt to express their thoughts; with this game and the complex puzzles it creates... you can have turns that overstay their welcome. The other reason is randomness; while the randomness is well-controlled compared to other games in this genre, it's very influential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
A brain burning puzzle for sure. Do the random die rolls and card draws offer hope, or are they just pitfalls that render planning hopeLESS?  

Get's a full point bump for being an accessible solo experience and the fantastic production.  It is a bit fiddly, but I suppose that is the price you pay for the challenge.

This game is a treasure! I will sit down to play it with anyone who wants to, and it also lends itself exceedingly well to solo play. The game does an excellent job of evoking the feeling of desperately tying to accomplish the impossible, with roadblocks in your path every step of the way. Admittedly, I do have a keen interest in this historical period, but even if you don't appreciate the added element that the theme brings, you can play it more abstractly (ignoring theme) and still get the compelling experience this game has to offer.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: I was honestly surprised by this game as the theme didn't hold much interest for me before playing it. However, it's an engaging cooperative game with just enough moving parts to be interesting without overwhelming. Manipulating the slave catchers in order to move slaves safely past them is a puzzle, as is generating money through population of the seperate areas of the map. This game plays well solo. Similar to many wargames, playing this game will give you more than a passing knowledge of the conditions and considerations involved in the decision-making process this game's situation models.

RATING: 8
Setting aside the historical theme, which other reviews have fully covered, Freedom is a very engaging, puzzle-y, co-op that can feel like a Pandemic replacement. The theme, though, can make it both more desirable and less desirable to play versus other co-op games. 

The cards and variability they provide from play to play add to the experience, but don't change the fact that Freedom, at its core, is a literal cube pushing puzzle. Still, there is a weight to the cube pushing that is not present in other games. I do wish they had put more historical content on the cards than it currently offers (each card gives you a short snippet of how it fits into history).

I have a hard time rating this game. The historical significance and importance of it is huge. The problem with the heavy theme, there isn't much "high five" time after a win, more relief. I'm glad it was made, and hope that is grows in popularity.

As a co-op game, it's just okay. It scales nicely, but as much thought as goes into the game in the beginning, it feels crowded and rushed at the end.

I've only ever played this solo and that might actually be the best way to play this game. The game's theme almost requires that you take the extra time to puzzle out moves with as little "loss" as possible. The theme of this game is really well done and was what sold me on getting it in the first place. The board is well designed and the cards all are releated to historic events, people, or places. You really have to make tough decisions about who makes it to freedom and who doesn't. With that said, the game mechanics are a little lacking because there's really not that much randomness. It's a puzzle (as most solo games tend to be) with a nearly identical starting setup every game. The only thing that significantly changes from game to game is the way the cards come out, specifically the ones that hurt you. I'll probably play through the different player counts using various character combinations in solo games but I don't know if this has a permanent spot on my shelf. The only reason I would even consider keeping it is because of the educational value and using this game to teach my kids some valuable history.

solid 7 for me.strong theme immerses people in the coop gameplay.its hard and challenging.through the game i got movie flashes of 12 years slave.the key to victory is finding balance between slave movement and taking/buying time tokens of that time era.that can lead from a game where you have to rescue slaves into a game where you need to find a way how to effective sacrifice them.

another little gripe is with the slavecatcher tokens.they are too small for the board you can hardly see them. they should really keep those wooden pieces in it.

another than that its awesome coop game.and i dont like them that much.theme helps a lot in this.

My biggest beef with this game is that it's compared to Pandemic. It's like comparing chocolate ice cream to muddy water someone froze. They are both cold and brown, but I don't want to eat one of those whereas the other I want to eat every day of my life for every meal until diabetes kicks in... and even then I'm no quitter! They are both co-op, and they both have cubes and a board. That's where the comparison ends. The action in Pandemic mounts. The action in Freedom crawls. I feel confident that I can play three games of Pandemic in the time it takes to play Freedom. 

This game was very accurately described by a guy we played with thebadbishop (BGG username) as "line simulator." The slavery theme gets this game rated so high because the puzzle, while there, is really boring. The game could have easily been themed as an airport trying to get people to their flights. Occasionally a TSA officer comes in, knocks the person out of line, gives them a quick check, then sends them to the back of the line. No one would want to play it, but it could be themed that.

I really love co-op games. They let you see how other people think, and I do enjoy hearing how other people's plans differ from my own. The other thing co-op games do for me is that they allow me to moderately cover up my unbridled thirst for victory by calling it team wins. I try to not be too competitive, but I always want to win. With co-op games the other players are on my team, so I can let loose my devious plans. The first time we played Freedom it beat us. It didn't beat us by much, in fact a single bone headed play early doomed us, but it did win. I wanted to play again just to see if I could solve the puzzle. The second play we coasted to victory. Now that we've beat "line simulator" I really have no reason to play it again.

It's not the worst game I've ever played but it is very boring. I would never choose to play it over Pandemic.

I've had this only on WANT TO PLAY so far because I've been sort of burned out on co-op games lately.
A friend of a friend buys ONLY co-op games!!
And we have to play them... which is fine - some of the time...

Anyway, people you are trying to help escape are represented by tiny cubes. An abstraction. A thing.
However, many a game has people represented as tiny cubes. One recent review I watch delved into this a little more. I think he did a pretty decent job. He went on to say that there is a pretty decent amount of info on the cards in this game that could be educational.

---------
the prime US-based example of civil disobedience. helping people escape, breaking laws such as the fugitive slave act.

it's like, what if someone held your niece in a basement - no, chained to their front porch, and they passed a law that said it was illegal for you to break her out of there. would you break the law or wait for the law to be changed?

bravo for bringing this topic up for a game, despite being a very un-fun topic.

Co-op.  It's pretty thematic, the cards with plenty of real people and events, the board play which was tough and you had to zig when the slave catchers were zagging to get slaves to freedom.

I thought the theme really tied into everything really well. The slave catcher's movement is really interesting. Balancing trying to move slaves to the North with trying to keep the slave catchers from closing off numerous gaps is a key part of the game. The one thing I didn't like was that there were turns where I felt there was little I could do. Maybe it was my fault for the moves I made (or we made) as a group, however. It was a close and tense game which is always good in a coop.

Wow. Whatever hype this has garnered is well deserved.

I would push for this to be used in high school and/or college history class. We need more games that do this to us. The rating is only lower because of how BGG classifies each number.

A challenging cooperative game with a few interesting mechanics that make it fresh and differentiate it from the sea of co-op games produced recently (2009-2014).  That said, I got bored having to move the slave catchers back and forth on their respective tracks in order to gain just a few extra dollars to prolong the game and try to win; however, I suspect that we were playing inefficiently.  If you're a fan of total co-op games, this one is worth checking out.  Personally, I prefer semi-co-ops (one-vs-many or team-vs-team).

Played a test game at GenCon 2012 - so things may change before it is produced.   Excellent original theme, and some real tension by the 3rd turn, as determining how to manipulate the slave catchers (or just blaze past them) becomes more difficult with time (and a board that has fewer options).  Curious to see what changes (if any) will be in the final version.

It is hard to rate this game. On one hand, I think it's good. On the other hand, I think it's only good 1-2 player, and I played it 4 player. I would avoid playing it 4 player again.

When I first saw this, I was turned off by the theme, which I shrugged off as a gimmick: you mean, we get to take credit for ending slavery by pretending they are cubes on the board, tossing them casually aside when they die? No thanks.

After I played for the first time, however, I realized that it truly is an emotional experience. Since you are unlikely to lose a slave in the first couple of turns, you actually start believing you can save them all. When the first one gets captured (and I know it's strange to say), it's actually heartbreaking. The first time it happened to us, a pall was cast over the room. Because of a cube. 

At that moment, I began to realize that trying to save them all is not only impossible, but is the surest way to lose the game, which suddenly made our decisions that much harder, and more painful. This confirms, for me, that this is not just a rethemed Pandemic, but a substantially more emotional and historically thought-provoking experience.

Very heavy cooperative game, both gamewise and themewise. The theme is handled tactfully and with good historical research. The gameplay is very challenging and can be a little bit too puzzle-y at times, which can lead to frustration - but a very good game nonetheless.

Very good game , very very very and very difficult to win,
I have played it solo with two characters and mode easy 
(I use only two moves for the slaves catcher !!),
I won only once but I love this game.

I played it once to 4 players, long ( 3 hours with the explanations ) but my players were pleased to try it,
we won very tight with the easy mode.

Really interesting coop with a unique theme, albeit a bit dark. I really enjoyed all the historical information on the cards and perhaps most of all, the fact that we are actually working to achieve a goal instead of the typical coop games where a bunch of bad stuff gets thrown at you and you just try to survive. Also, asymmetrical player powers are always welcome! Definitely not a game that would have caught my eye, but one that I'm happy I got to play.

RATING: 8
Due to the subject matter of this game, it is one of my most wanted to love it games ever (probably tied with Antiquity), unfortunately, it isn't really a game for me.

Some people love theme through flavour text, I am not one of them. All those cards in the game? The only thing I see on them is the mechanics. They have old-timey pictures, a name, and, I think, flavour text, but that's all lost on me. This isn't a negative for me, but I believe this is more a game of subject matter expressed through fluff, than subject matter expressed through mechanics game, and so there isn't much "feel" of slavery abolition for me. At the end of the day, those cubes are just cubes.

I love co-ops, however, I've come to learn that I love co-ops as individuals playing towards a common goal, as opposed to co-ops as everyone plans out everyone's turns together and then play it out. Some games demand one way or the other, others facilitate one or the other. This one is somewhere between demanding or facilitating an everyone plans out everything together.

A big reason for this is that everyone is manipulating the same tokens. Everyone buys from the same token pool, so every token you buy is one someone else can't. You'll be moving the same slaves as the other players, so you need to coordinate your moves to be sure that you aren't leaving the next player in queue stuck.

It is not really possible to do much in this game without consulting the other players first.

The mechanics, however, are quite sound. The slavecatcher movement rules and the constraints on slave movement are clever and create opportunities for clever movement plans. The game is difficult but winnable.

And I wish I loved it. But I don't.

I liked it more than I thought I would. The management of the slave catchers adds a puzzle element that elevates the game, and the one unknown move with the dice is just the right amount of randomness for me.  The rest of the game is just figuring out how the group is going to spend their money.

There are two main hooks to this game: the theme, and the main tug-of-war mechanism between the slave catchers and the slaves. The former I respect but it does not really resonate with me, and the latter gets a bit boring after a while. Still, a good design, and a very good production overall.

Rating this game is tough. I love the theme. It's educational, brilliant design that works so well. But it feels kinda bad to play it. Slaves will die.

For a set of 5 static paths, the slave-catchers manage to feel remarkably like a malevolent net of danger constantly getting in your way.

Going in, I didn't like the sound of the money-for-victory mechanic (you need to muster a certain amount of political support in each era, which is represented by buying expensive tokens), but in actual play found it redeemed by the fact that the overwhelming majority of your income is dictated by where slaves move and are positioned - so making the requisite money feels like a real part of the board play rather than just "well, we need to siphon off a certain amount of our cash over the course of the game".

This is such a serious game, that I don't play it very often. It's a big challenge and you really feel the loss even though the cubes are an abstraction of human beings, I don't want to lose anyone. It's playable solo which is always a big plus, and it's cooperative which means that it gets bonus points for being a game that helps the world be more about working together and less about competing against one another.

Il y a à peine 150 ans, les hommes n'étaient pas tous libres et égaux. Aux Etats-unis était encore en vigueur un des fléaux de l'humanité : L'esclavage. Sympa, comme thème, après la saint-valentin, non ? Dans Freedom, nous allons revivre l'Histoire des noirs américains ensemble. Car c'est un coopératif. Vous prenez le rôle abolitionnismes (C'est à dire de personnes voulant mettre fin à l'esclavage) et vous allez aider les esclaves à s'enfuir des plantations, où la vie était un enfer, pour rejoindre la liberté au Canada. Oui, mais voilà, les riches sudistes blancs n'ont pas l'intention de laisser partir leur main d'oeuvre 'bon marché" et vont se mettre en mode "Attrapez les tous"  pour bloquer les routes et ramener ceux qui seront pris au marché aux esclaves. Ce jeu est très immersif d'un point de vue historique, avec pleins de cartes faisant référence à cette sombre période (qui se termina en 1865 avec l'adoption du 13ème amendement par Abraham Lincoln, qui mis fin à l'esclavage aux Etats unis).

I like this game a lot. Have mostly played it solitaire. I love the game mechanics and find them well tied in thematically and the choice of theme is pretty special... not sure if that is an appropriate work but from the perspective as someone who see board games as a form of art and expression on a lot of levels combined with me having a soft spot for political art and finding its role in challenging  our view of the world priceless this game hits a real soft spot for me. I can see how a lot of people would be put off by this subject matter but yeah each to their own I recommend you at least try the game out as its pretty educational.

RATING: 7
Cooperative game where players are members of the Underground Railroad, trying to aid a certain number of slaves escape to Canada to win the game.

Players on their turn purchase tokens that move slaves up a point to point map, out of Southern States plantation, through cities, into the North, and finally into Canada.  As cities are passed through, income can be drawn, which is reinvested into more tokens, or sympathizer cards which grant added abilities and powers.
At the end of each turn, more slaves are injected into the plantations, with overflow going to the Slaves Lost track.  The game ends when a certain number of slaves escape to Canada (victory) or when the Slaves Lost track fills up.

Tough, puzzle like game, as meager resources are spent to ensure slaves keep moving north.  Severe stacking limits on slaves in cities means bottlenecks quickly form, causing overflow when the slave markets add more slaves to the game.  The slave catcher pieces, run by the game system, swoop on slaves as they pass through the lines, but can be exploited to make gaps for other slaves to pass through.

Excellent game, but very difficult to defeat.

[1 play] I enjoyed Freedom and want to play it again. We lost pretty dismally, though; we could've gotten enough slaves to Canada, but couldn't manage to buy all the support tokens. I think this was a great theme for a co-op, and it's always a plus to me when a game slips in some historical stuff. I wish the people I played with had been more into it. (General gaming pet peeve: When on your turn you draw a card and something happens, don't just start telling me what the something is. I want to hear the name of the card, and if there's additional flavor text, I probably want to hear that too.) What I would take as the strategic lesson for next time is the importance of manipulating the slave catchers. You can't keep clear of all of them all the time, because they're always somewhere, so you have to become more skilled at the dynamic of luring them off in one direction and then seizing opportunities for slaves to travel where they're not. This will constantly be shifting back and forth. Another lesson I'm not as sure of, but think is worth trying, is to try to hoard more money in the earlier ages, because it seems hard to fundraise in wartime. We pretty much pushed forward from age to age as fast as we could, then found ourselves stuck during the war and running out of time with not enough money to buy support tokens.

RATING: 7
The game manages to treat an awkward theme with dignity and still be a playable game per se. The most interesting aspect is a card track "river" where cards, good and bad for you, move down from most to least expensive. Bad ones fall off and activate unless you buy to remove them. Money is tight and required for certain actions as well as to buy cards.

The rest of the game is a logistics puzzle of moving slaves up to Canada without getting caught by slave catchers. There's unavoidable push-your-luck with the slave catchers moving by die, and that mechanism provides some good tension.

On a related note, I highly recommend, "The Myth of the Lost Cause: Why the South fought the Civil War and why the North won" as a myth-busting examination of the roots of the US Civil War. Anyone who claims it wasn't about slavery but the abstract concept of states' rights is an apologist. Re-examining the South's attitudes towards slaves as sub-humans makes playing this game even heavier.

Brian Mayer is fantastic. He does such interesting work AND has designed a great game! It tackles a difficult historical subject, but stays engaging despite the stress I always feel while playing it! I would like to see more games like this one. I picked up the expansion cards, which you could probably pass on unless you play the game  a lot and/or like deepening the historical aspect. I also picked up the slave catcher pawns, and I find that they help me not (conveniently) forget to move them!

Thought-provoking but needs improvement / there are concerns...

...Could have humanized slaves more rather than just cubes, as they become more of a resource which is not the narrative that should be brought out
...Feels awkward to bring slaves to an area as THE means of fundraising
...Slave catcher behavior is a little odd and the mechanics of such are not illustrated enough from an educational angle - they seem to behave merely as robot sentries.
... Also unsure if this is reflected in the history in some way, but peculiar that there is no financial aid for moving into Canada // necessity for slave catcher movement
... Also, not sure if scoring is really needed.

Very difficult cooperative game about the ending of slavery in the US.   It has very difficult decisions and sequencing to solve exactly what to do and when to accomplish two distinct but contradictory goals while avoiding the immediate loss condition in just eight turns.    

Theme draws you in, you'll feel terrible when you lose this game and relief when you do.

Just when I thought that it would be hard to find a game that feels truly fresh and important to the world of board gaming, Freedom showed up. First off, it's a brave theme to take on and one that is treated with respect. It feels a little odd speaking of 'slave cubes' and 'slave catcher markers' when explaining the rules, but that's the game- feels even stranger than trying to explain Labyrinth to somebody. Beyond the sensitivity of the subject, Freedom is a truly strong game. With theme aside, it works as a very puzzly network abstract game, with players moving pieces northward while working out how far and what routes they can move on without triggering the AI opponent. Even as an abstract, I most likely would have enjoyed this. The theme, however, raises the bar in every way. It respects the history and honours the events and people who supported the abolitionist cause. The mechanics of card play isn't as thematically linked as the movement, though clever card play can mean the difference between winning and losing. And this is a difficult game to win, although the publisher made sure to note in the section on 'winning' that losing the game doesn't mean the fight against slavery was lost, only that certain goals were not met in our particular game scenario. Very tasteful stuff here.

I like the theme of this game. This game is tough and tight though and feels really hard to beat. You better be ready for some real planning and chess like moves to win this game because it's a real thinkers game. It's tough to win, but I really like this game a lot.

Only played it solo so far but I like it quite a bit. The game is REALLY HARD in solitaire mode though. It seems like it is almost a must to take one of the characters that has the ability to move slaves as an action to have a even a remote chance of winning. But only four plays so far so I might be wrong. Will certainly try again with one of the other characters.

Outstanding game, and a phenomenal co-op.  The mechanics are fascinating and it's a hard game to beat but not impossible.  The stakes of the game, due to the theme, are incredibly high.  The historical aspect and the information on the cards is interesting but the game still feels like a game and not a history lesson.  Highly recommend this.

Impressive game about the dark history of slavery in the US. In this coop the players together are the 'good guys' trying to help the slaves escape. The theme is immersive, and I like how much history you get on the cards. This is not a laughing-out-loud fun type of game. But it is a fantastic experience, and as a game it works very well. A tough and excellent coop!

Two solo plays so far, with a victory in the second game by the skin of my teeth.  All of the Slaves Lost spots were filled during the last Slave Market Phase.

What a great little puzzle.  The rules are very light, but the gameplay is amazingly fun.  Curiously, the part of the game I might like most is the fact there is a randomized Slave Catcher Phase, which adds just enough unpredictability to the game to keep it great.  

Hmmm…a third game with two players this time, and we won easily on the harder difficulty, losing only two slaves and winning with two rounds to spare.  I'm pretty sure we played it 100% correctly.  Is it too easy?  This can't be right!

Ok, another solo loss.  I think I MAY have forgotten to take out the cards labelled 3 or 4 players in the decks before, but this just makes the game even harder.  Really enjoying the challenge right now.

Another win on the harder difficulty with two players.  We rescued many more than needed with 3 slaves to spare.

Brilliant little game that is quick to setup, has beautiful components and quick to play.  

I know I have said this in the past but this really is one of the best and I dare say "elegant", "streamline" solitaire I've ever play.  Just awesome.

It's not much of a historical simulation though, its at its heart a very well made solitaire puzzle (or multiplayer if you are playing it that way) that is oozing theme. 

At least unlike a certain other Euro game, this game is declaring its cubes "Slaves" instead of hiding it.  Kudos to the designer for designing such an outstanding game around such a sensitive topic.  Brilliant.

Its one point off a ten only because even with the random way the game plays each time, there are only six characters to play with and even with optional rules and hard level, I can see myself taking a break from it after playing 50-60 games or so, once I have "mastered" each character.  BUT 50-60 games is a crap TON of game for the price of entry!  A bargain!

RATING: 8.5
Challenging co-op game that uses cards and tokens to allow players to attempt to move slaves from the Southern plantations up north to Canada and freedom...but they must avoid the 5 slave catchers on the way.  

Game is timed by use of slave market cards (9 to 11 rounds) and players must rescue a minimum number of slaves AND generate enough publicity for their cause before the game ends.  

Players lose if they don't accomplish this by the end of the game OR if they lose too many slaves (slaves are lost if there is no empty plantation slot for them). 

Players must find a balance between moving slaves out and raising funds for publicity and for moving slaves while also carefully choosing each slaves routes to minimize their captures (captured slaves are returned to the plantation).

Only two plays so far, but I've found the game to be very engaging and enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to further plays of the game.

Bought in July 2015.

Game 1: solo with Conductor (easy mode). Fulfilled winning conditions, except there was no space left in the plantations for the final shipment of slaves. 14 points.

Game 2: solo with Agent (easy mode). Wow those red cards can be killers. 7 points.

Game 3: solo with Stockholder (easy mode). Failed AGAIN. Fulfilled the winning conditions, but lost too many slaves on the last shipment. 15 points.

Game 4: solo with Preacher (easy mode). This time, seeing that I'd fail on the last slave shipment again, I tried to free a couple of extra slaves on the last turn. Result: 16 points.

Game 5: 2-player (easy mode) with me as Shepherd and Andrew as Conductor. Won, with zero leeway. 41 points.

Ugh, this game is DIFFICULT. But fascinating, I felt like I'd read a thrilling history book.

Given away for secret Santa 2015.

Gen Con 2013 purchase. After initial 2 plays, I found it to be an interesting, difficult and tense game. This one didn't really appeal to me at first, but that was just me questioning why Academy would do a "non-wargame."  After listening to Uwe Eickert (of Academy Games) explain the gameplay to me and inviting me to sit down to a demo, I quickly came to the conclusion that this was one excellent game.  As I sat playing for the first time, I came to realize, finally, that it is historical type games (wargames, political games, whatever) that really get me interested.  This one in particular brings out a lot of historical items that I simply was not familiar with - and I should be, being that I was trained to be a Social Science teacher!  Good game, good history.  Winner from Academy Games and thanks to them for getting a game like this published with such high quality components.

In two solo games, Freedom: The Underground Railroad has destroyed me. Victory is not easily forthcoming. Although it's really a matter of pushing cubes around and playing with the mathematics of pathways and loci, the difficulty impresses upon me the sense that running the Underground Railroad was, in fact, not an easy feat. A great game for what it is: I think I might like it better than Pandemic, although Pandemic seems more chaotic and tense.

This game is one of the most uncomfortable games you can play, which is a testament to its beautiful theme.  The fact that you sometimes have to do an action, knowing that you could be responsible for the capture of your fellow slaves is a very heartbreaking decision, but allows you to understand better the struggles in that situation.  As Academy Games does, the game is steeped in history and gives a much better understanding of history as a result.

Brilliantly executed theme.  

Slavery in America is an extremely dark and potentially offensive idea for the basis of a game but this was handled with respect.  The theme shines and the difficult task presented to the abolitionists carries through into gameplay seamlessly.  The weight of the decisions comes from an actual feeling of loss and fear of losing the slaves to slave catchers.

Reminds me a lot of ticket to ride in that it's a clean, efficient design with spatial decisioning. Slightly more complex than Marklin, which is good. All this "complexity" does is increase the variability and replayability over TTR. Plus, it's a whole lot more interactive. Theme is heavy, but as a black gamer I TOTALLY appreciate it! Not too heavy, mind you. A must own for every family.

Played at Gen Con.  Designer told us the average win percentage is about 35-40%.  Apparently we somewhat broke the game, although I'm still not sure what we did that would have been different from other players.  We needed to save 27 slaves before 18 (i think) were lost.  We saved 30 and lost 2.  Nevertheless, it still felt tense most of the way through, so I'm curious to see how it plays with a different card draw.

Overall a fun game, with a fair treatment of the subject matter, all things considered.  There is a lot of historical flavor which helps justify game play and verbiage that otherwise might cross the line of tastefulness.  I think it has great potential as a co-op historical game and features a natural limit to alpha-gamer syndrome.

Many of my favorite solo games tend to be rules dense with intriguing, chewy game systems that I want to learn more about. They tend to score well on when you compare complexity with payoff although complexity tends to be pretty high. Freedom is not one of those games - it's actually pretty simple to play but on the other hand has plenty of tough decisions to keep you engaged. I love the economic flare to the game and the theme is abstract but eerily strong.

It's a tad on the dry side but the game sets up quickly and moves at a quick pace keeping you hooked the whole time. You can get a game setup and done in an hour if you're quick. There's really no other game like it.

Best with 1-3 and good with 1-4

In contrast to most other cooperative games, where the game actively fights you, Freedom has very little non-player-controlled activity. Instead, the slave catchers are predominantly moved as a direct result of the players' actions. This makes this game quite thinky: Pandemic is about risk mitigation, Space Alert is all about real-time execution, and Hanabi is about hand management and communication, but this game is mainly about carefully planning out your moves. 

The end game in particularly is problematic: With very little randomness a loss is visible from afar, yet with high complexity the game will have to be played to near completion to determine whether the prognosis was correct or not. I'd prefer a bit more surprise and less brain burn for the last third of the game.

I'm still not sure whether the fully cooperative mode is optimal for this kind of game, since it can essentially be 'solved' by an alpha player.

Components-wise I have a few complaints: The coins should have come in different sizes, the token spaces on the board are too bright (it can be hard to tell if there is axtually a token there or not), and the grey tokens are not distinct enough from their counterparts. The retail version comes with cardboard tokens for the slave catchers, and they disappear on the board.

Pretty solid coop. Definitely in the pandemic mold of cleaning up messes that pile up every turn which seems to be the dominant style (and frankly one I'm generally not in love with). But this one was clever and had enough moving parts to keep my interest. Figuring out how to move the people is really interesting because you have to balance positioning them to make maximum money while also minimizing slave catching and progressing them toward Canada. And the card row adds some interesting twists, I especially like how there are good cards to buy to get but also bad cards to buy to get rid of. That seems pretty unique.

A singular gaming experience. Of the games I've played, only Twilight Struggle touches it when it comes to historical emersion. The cooperative nature makes the constrictive pacing feel like you're really up against something as intense as racist ideology. It feels like you just can't do enough. I'm yet to win it, but I come AWEFUL DAMN CLOSE each time (that's not anger-caps, it's joy-caps). The game's tension is striking.

That said, it's a difficult sell for an evening of fun. That's why it hasn't been played much. I have no intention of getting rid of it any time soon, though. It's a marvellous experience, if one that I take in small doses.

Freedom is a remarkably thoughtfully designed cooperative game about attempting to move slaves from the American South along the underground railroad to Canada in the mid-19th century.  It's truly an "event" game, and sensitively handles a difficult subject in a way that evokes emotion yet still operates as an excellent puzzle in its own right.  The crux of the gameplay revolves around two competing goals -- managing money to spend on support and using that money to move slaves past a moving wall of slavecatchers.  It's a tense battle against the game system, made moreso by the fact that it feels like you are responsible for saving or losing human lives.

At least in my one play with four players, it was exceedingly difficult; we were able to save (and not lose) more than the requisite number of slaves, but weren't near reaching our support target.  And we couldn't identify what we could have done differently to win.  As we played (at a convention), we attracted many intrigued onlookers.  The African-Americans that stopped by noted that the game's subject hit too close to home, but thought it might have educational value.

As a game, I deeply respected the theme and the attempt to bring honor and attention to the importance of the underground railroad.  And I liked the puzzle it presented, the attempt to avoid the slavecatcher pawns, and the thematic color of the cards.   But the game was very long (over three hours) and dismayingly hard, making it rather draining.

Although they are vastly different in terms of actual game play, this game reminded me of Pandemic quite a bit. I did like this one much more. 

On to the elephant in the room, the theme. It's quite heavy. You do feel the weight of your decisions more because of the theming but the game is abstract enough that I don't imagine anyone should stay away because of it. I feel like it would be a great game to get students to understand some of the difficult tradeoffs and stress that abolitionists had to deal with.

I anticipate holding onto my copy for a long time and can't wait to see what else academy games publishes.

RATING: 7
Logistics puzzle with an unusual theme. Managing the economy of the underground railroad is an important prerequisite to enable movements and advance toward the victory condition to free enough slaves. 

For a game with such a strong theme and a deck of cards with historical events the gameplay is astonishingly dry. Cooperation among the players is far less relevant than in the best cooperative games as no player has an individual position. Still nice to play with more than one player to discuss strategy but gameplay doesn't change much. The game is prone to alpha gamers dominating the group's decisions. A good game with equal players. Interested to see how it works as a solitaire game.

RATING: 8
The thematic nature and the manipulation of game-controlled pieces make this game a puzzle with a great historical theme. It feels a bit like twilight struggle in its card playing system, with negative and positive cards. It would be a great teaching tool, but I plan to use it to get my more history-focused friends and family deeper into the hobby.

RATING: 5
[b]First Impressions:[/b] This is the most difficult cooperative game I've played so far. It is tight and unforgiving. It's depressing mechanically and thematically, which I mean that in a very positive way, as the mechanics complement the very dark theme. It's really one of the first games that really felt like a sort of piece of art. Speaking of which, I found the art work and print to be very nice. Not flashy, but very civil war americano style. But don't let the simple art fool you, this is a very, very brainy game but the setting really is fleshed out.

When you are playing well, the game will take a long time to play out. I would suspect a group of four will take about 2 hours, if they have all played before. It took my group 3 hours to lose in the final round. This is both the best cooperative game I've played, but I wouldn't necessarily want to buy it for my own collection because of the accessibility issues.

If the game is close, can lead to incredible moments. However, the randomness of the event cards that show up, and the order of the slave market cards, make the game's difficulty vary wildly. While I'm okay scrapping a 30-min game of Pandemic if it randomly was too tough, I am not with a 90-min game of Freedom.

What can I say? Great thematic and historical good game, co-op. I don't like co-ops, because in my opinion the player with the greatest mouth tells most of the time to the other players what they must do. And if it's not the player with the biggest mouth it is the player with the most experience who will do. Giving this game less then a 7 should be a pitty ( because it is great in experience, theme etc) but it's not my cup off tea... I will play it again, maybe, but because i'm more a worker placement type it won't be on my demand. There is not a lot of playing involved, but a lot of experience...

RATING: 8
A game that I have only yet played solo. The theme is excellent, and the gameplay, while completely abstract, somehow manages to take you into a rich world of imagination. 

I’m not entirely sold on the split board - the political and economic tables on one side, and the map on the other - mainly because I think that the political (left) side of the board has a discouraging, dry-as-dust, clunky feel to it. There’s not a lot of reason to have the counters laid out as they are, and setting the cards out as a deck next to a map would put more focus on the map, which in my view would be a good thing.

The game mechanics work extremely well. On the map, the congestion in the railroad, the dangers of attracting the slave catchers - or the sacrifice of one group of escapees to save others - and the unrelenting flow of slaves into the plantations, are all handled in a streamlined and effective way.
 The money management - there’s never enough money - and the way guides are abstracted and implemented, are also excellent. The result is a game in which pressure starts from the beginning and only builds up. How can I keep the escapees moving? How can I avoid the slave catchers? 

I have yet to win a game, yet I constantly want to play another.

Although the theme is heavy on this one, based around slavery in America, I find these historically themed games incredibly interesting. The artwork on this game looks amazing and plays well based on reviews and videos I have looked into.

RATING: 8
Even one play is enough to confidently say this is an excellent co-op game. It rivals Pandemic and in some ways exceeds it. It's longer than Pandemic, though not dramatically more complex, and after a few rounds the mechanics are clear, sensible, and it plays smoothly. The game is difficult, though not impossible. Most importantly, this is a highly thematic game with a great historical setting. It creates great tension, everyone is invested in the outcome, and if you win the players will feel a great sense of victory. While not as rich and complex as Robinson Crusoe, this is a fantastic game. Highly recommended.

Excellent collaborative game with an educational and engaging theme of running the underground railroad.  Managing money and working together to move the slaves in a manner that allows for few lost slaves is no easy task.  Like most collaborative games, this one is susceptible to the dominant player concept, but if that is a concern, collaborate be games are not likely to be your cup of tea anyway.  In my limited experience, one feels constantly up against the gun and constantly wondering how to keep the slaves moving without eventually getting pinched in by the slave catchers.

I have played this both solitaire and as a true coop and I  enjoy the optimization puzzle it presents.  The historical flavor lends the game much of its appeal for me as well. I like the blending of historical subjects into Euro mechanics that has characterized a number of recent games from Twilight Struggle, 1960, Campaign Manager, Founding Fathers, and some of the recent Academy Games releases.

Yeah...I'm just not cool with deciding which slaves should die so that I can save other slaves.  The theme makes it really difficult for me to enjoy the game.  I get it that we're trying to get the slaves to freedom (hence the name) but when you know one slave will be caught so that you can get another across the border...well...that's just too heavy for a game night, for me.

RATING: 8
There is a lot to like about this game. First and foremost is the theme, which is unusual, interesting, and well-developed (despite some abstraction that pushes the dark nature of the theme away some). It's a co-op game, but not of the "whack-a-mole" variety. Instead, you are simply given a task that is difficult from the get-go, and you have to figure out how to approach it. Not the least of your problems is the fact that two of your tasks are at odds with each other. It's brutal, and not only did we lose our game, we pretty much knew we had done so when there were still three turns left. Nevertheless, had time permitted, I think we would have immediately tried again. The rulebook has some shortcomings (insert my usual rant about Kickstarter games here) but by and large I think this is a game worth looking at, not just for the importance and novelty of the theme but because it's a pretty solid and different co-operative game in its own right.

For a supposedly very thematic game, I wish the slave catchers were not just generic shapes/colors, and that the support tokens didn't just feel like a money sink. The raising support by moving to northern states also seemed to make more sense mechanically than thematically to me, as success of escapes do not to me automatically equate to support and funds. Besides not gelling with me thematically though there isn't really anything wrong with this game, the point to point movement of the slaves, the card powers, the action system and the ways the slaves moved felt pretty smooth, I just didn't find anything that popped out at me besides the unique theme.

EDIT: This game is much easier with fewer players. Also, the order that cards come up and the random slave catcher movement isn't adding enough variety from game to game.

Backed this on Kickstarter. It is a solid coop game. Depending on your luck this can be a relatively easy game or a brutal game. If you think it is too easy it has some options to take it up a notch. The theme conveys well, however, not everyone will be comfortable with the theme which is why I rated it a 7 instead of an 8. For instance I have an African-American friend who has bluntly told me he will never be interested in playing it. He does not find the theme offensive, but it is a touchy topic. I think this a great game for those who are not uncomfortable with the theme.

Die Ablenkungen haben die Entscheidungsfindung erheblich gestört und einige Fehlentscheidungen nach sich gezogen. Das Austüffteln der besten Route Runde für Runde macht Spaß. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist aber wirklich heftig. Wichtig ist, dass man gezielt einzelne Figuren opfert um die Sklavenfänger kontrolliert zu bewegen. Das Motto "wir retten alle" wird als bald mit "oder niemanden" ergänzt. Bin auf eine weitere Runde gespannt. Der Preispunkt von 70+ EUR ist allerdings heftig. Sicher das Spielbrett ist groß, aber das gesamte Spielmaterial fühlt sich nicht "70 Eur" schwer an.

This is one of the few co-op games I enjoy. Generally they do not float my boat but this one has something different about it. Probably it is the historical accuracy and the educational aspect of the information on the cards that I like, or even the fantastic artwork and colour palette of the board. Either way it is a game that I can see myself playing for quite a while.

But I have only ever played it solo. Why that is I don't know it's just not a game that I have ever thought of bringing up in conversation when discussing what game to play next on game night.

It is a very difficult game and I had been totally crushed on every try previously ... but I won both of these!  On both occasions it did come down to the final turn and I won by the thinnest of margins but a win never-the-less. 

I spent some time trying to work out what I had done differently. The only thing I could come up with was that I played the game with only one character on both of these wins. Previously I had always tried it with two or three and failed miserably every time. Is the game easier when playing with only one player? I don't know ...the game never feels easy (both of these games were with the easier side of the slaves lost tile), but two wins in a row indicates that something had changed and I don't have the faith that it was due to my brilliance of play!

Great game.

I'm giving this game such a high rating not on the game mechanics itself (which would probably be around a 7), but on what the game attempts to accomplish. This game (IMO) is trying to emulate the thoughts and feelings of working the underground railroad, and to provide historical context from which to do so. In that regard, the tension, and feeling of helplessness is spot on. The component quality is top tier; this game will last. The only reason I'm taking points off is because this game does not offer much in terms of variability. Sure, the abolitionists cards might be different, but that's not enough IMO. Beyond that, this is a great game, and one I can't wait to show off to everyone I know.

Freedom: The Underground Railroad is a co-operative game in which players attempt to secretly ferry black slaves from southern U.S. plantations up to Canada, and freedom, via the underground railroad.  Doing this won't be easy as there are slave catchers about who know the various routes taken north.  They'll be on the lookout to bring the slaves back to their owners.

In the meantime players are also attempting to generate momentum in the abolitionist movement.  This is done through card play.  The cards are a treasure trove of historical information regarding characters, and events of import.

If the players can free enough slaves, and end slavery all together, they win.  If too many fleeing slaves are caught everyone looses.

I enjoyed playing Freedom: The Underground Railroad.  I liked getting historical information from the text on the cards.  It really helps put what is going on in the game into context.  Attempting to plan escape routs to Canada was always intense.  Seeing them cross the border always exhilarating.  If you like history, co-ops, or a good strategy game, you should give this one a try!

Has wonderful period flavour and the graphics are superb. Game is not difficult but it can be a teeny bit fiddly remembering to pick up funds every time you move a slave, remembering the effects of the opposition cards that are showing, remembering your card's special powers and so on. As a co-op, it works well; while more complex than a game like Pandemic, it has less "alpha geek" effect because there are too many choices for one person to call all the shots. It's just a shade more complex than suits my wife unfortunately.

RATING: 6
2 different conversations are necessary when talking about a game like Freedom.  As a game, there isn't much there aside from problem solving how to handle too many needs for too few resources.  This simple structure works well enough when there are more players to divide those resources between and more actions to use in accomplishing goals, but it falls apart at lower player counts and even the variable parts of the game aren't enough to give 1 or 2 players enough options to help them change a doomed outcome or enough to do while waiting for an forecasted victory.  However, what the game does well is creating an [i]experience[/i].

As an experience, the game is simply amazing and worthy of all the praise it has received.  Players really do feel the seeming hopelessness of the cause, the frustration of opposition, and the agony of making tough decisions where loss will occur.  The game is hard, punishing even, and as players learn the game they are confronted time and again with the need to push forward for the cause even when it may seem counterintuitive or downright wrong.  Even though some of this becomes tempered as players learn the pacing and strategies of the game, the message of the game still hits home and the difficulty of the cause is still present.

However, like other games that primarily trade on the experience, the game isn't one that will see tons of replay, else the experience should fade, so while everyone should have the opportunity to play the game it may not be one that everyone feels the need to own.

The theme of slavery (more specifically, moving slaves from the South up into Canada via the system of the Underground Railroad) is handled with much respect.

I was first attracted to the game because of the cards.  While they are not the best quality, I do find their presentation so engaging and informative; it's just a wonderful way to experience the game.  The rest of the components are fantastic.  The board is huge and sturdy, and the tokens are solid cardboard.  It's really well put together.

The gameplay is brutal...in a good way.  Every decision, every choice, every action you take has so much meaning because of the subject matter.  I feel like a player could focus solely on the mechanisms of the game, the math of it, if you will, and have more success.  But even though slaves are being abstractly represented by wooden cubes, the feeling of loss when one of them is captured is awful.

This is a stellar presentation of history and cardboard gaming.  I hope to find more like this.

*Apr 2014, 3 plays all solitaire (1 character)* I LOVE this game. 

The game is predictable enough to be an excellent puzzle (ie, its difficulty is not attributed to chaotic randomness but due to some element of foresight) but the opposition cards and slave catcher dice rolls keep it fresh. 

I love the standard Academy Games overproduction, and I don't mean that negatively. It's like when Louis CK tells a dirty joke.... he's so hilarious that he doesn't need to, but he does because "hey, f you". Academy's overproduction is similar "We don't need to because this game is awesome, but f you, here's an enormous thick board, beautiful artwork, huge cubes, and other trappings of games that typically hide their flaws in beautiful components, just because". Ok, weak analogy but there are parallels. 

The game plays in an hour..... even with AP. I love that the rules are simple but the decisions feel significant.

Rating will go up or down, based off replayability. Right now, it's a 9 for me but rating it an 8.5 to account for the honeymoon phase I'm going through

*End of April, 2014* After 8 plays, I still adore it. Bumped up half a point to a 9. Still waiting to tire of the game, a game this engrossing can't last forever.........

*June 2014* So this game has opened up for me even more. I found new strategies and new paths to victory. Excerpt from comments on my latest play (and first victory):

"I am happy to report that despite winning the game, I am no less driven to play it again. I feel that the puzzle within is still heavily appealing. 

What I've learned from this session: Those who say you need a role that has you moving extra slaves are WRONG. I used the preacher to his benefits, giving me extra money. I bought support tokens early and those Age 3 abolitionist cards are freaking powerful and awesome. Yes, there is a finance-focused path to victory and the game is that much more diverse. As you can see, by game end there are still unused fundraising tokens.... I was able to ignore them and instead purchase conductor and support tokens. By missing out most of the 2nd age (only 3 cards drawn), I also missed out on FOUR RED CARDS buried in that deck, a subtle but significant advantage.

This game is even more brilliant than I had originally thought."

I also mentioned a new tactic that I was all but forced into using: Using "Move Twice" Conductor tokens to backtrack a slave one space and move them forward into a new path if they're stuck at a bottleneck. Jumping over other slaves is very useful as well to allow some movement in a traffic jam. 

I'll also mention that I played one incomplete 2p game with the wife. While we didn't get to finish it, playing with 2 roles changes up the strategy quite a bit due to the larger number of support tokens. I really liked this, it gives a lot more to explore. 

What a game.

The theming is done well here and I can see why the game has an emotional impact on a lot of players. To a cold co-op hater like myself there is not much to love. Underneath the labels it is a hard numbers game that gets almost no help from the event cards. There is very little mechanical arc.

An excellent puzzle-style co-op with a theme that at first might dissuade you, but after seeing how well it was implemented, pulls you in deeper. The small informative flavor text on each card, and it's accompanying game effect, teach you a small lesson about the history at that time.

RATING: 8.2
Deals with a sensitive subject very well. If you're looking for more information on the subject, large amounts of the rulebook are given over to an optional history lesson - every card in the game represents a historical person or event. 
The set-up is annoyingly fiddly; I haven't yet worked out a way to pack it away so that it doesn't take so long to set up, but is no worse than set up for something like Pathfinder: Rise of the Runelords.
The graphic design is beautiful and the only downside of the gorgeous huge board is the amount of table space it occupies.
The difficulty is well managed, with it being a tense game at any number of players.

This is the game I wanted Pandemic to be. The historical flavor coupled with the strong puzzle aspects make this one of the top co-op games out there. It hasn't come out as often lately, however, and when it does, it does feel like it tends to be solvable for me at this point. Despite that, I find this game very enjoyable whenever I play it, and I can't help but really admire the design. It's not a particularly difficult co-op, even if you use the more difficult modes, but I do appreciate this game for what it is. I prefer to play this one solo usually.

UPDATE: The fact that this game becomes so easy once you've "solved" it, and the promise of an expansion on the horizon being less and less likely made it easy to let go of this one. Great historical flavor, but the game presented here is a puzzle that plays out roughly the same way each time.

A strong and difficult co op game that treats with respect that very sensitive and dark period of history. It's mechanisms are very simple yet very difficult and every turn keeps you on edge.

RATING: 9
Quite possibly my favorite co-op game.  I've rated it a 9, but could easily see it going higher.  Needs a couple of more plays.  Strategically deep, tense, easy to pick up, and absolutely solid in terms of components.  And yes, educational.  I'm fairly well versed in Civil War history, and I was aware of the abolitionist movement, John Brown, the Kansas-Nebraska war, the Dread Scott case, etc.  However, this game puts these events into a narrative sweep that is as unsettling as it is breath taking.  This might just be "the great American game."  When is the last time that you played an historical game in which you cared about the game pieces?  When losing produced a visceral sense of having let "something" down.  No, not every historically based game needs to bring to the fore underlying notions of injustice.  But a game like this, makes me realize that all of those war games I've played over the years?..., they refer to events in which individuals died for no other reason than they happened to be part of a system that demanded sacrifice.  What a waste, what a horrible, horrible waste.

In this cooperative game, players are trying to rescue slaves to freedom in the US during the period of 1800-1865. Players may purchase fundraising tokens and conductor tokens to move slaves on the board. The board features five slave catchers which automatically move in response to movement by slaves on the board. Players win if they can buy 3 support tokens, and send 5 slaves to Canada before they lose the game. The end of game is either 8 rounds, or too many slaves overrun your limit. 

It's a fun game, and difficult to manage the cash flow. It's very challenging and looking forward to more plays.

Was expecting a good tight Euro game.  What I got was a game that is heavily decided by the luck of the draw.  It seems that the outcome is almost predetermined based on the order of the Slave Market and Conductor cards.  There's not really a depth of decisions to the game, most are obvious given the board state. The game is also very random (e.g. The order of the initial shuffle of cards can make it very easy or very hard).

One of the most important board games ever created. Excellent cooperative elements make every role imperative (though some are beter than others in a solo game). Clean mechanics with a highly complex array of give-and-take choices.  Some players may not favor the high element of luck in terms of the order that cards come out of the abolitionist decks. However, this can be mitigated by purchasing the support tokens and getting era decks out of the game before more unfavorable cards come up. Difficulty variations help gauge player efficiency and progress.

RATING: 5
It seems that I've been operating with the expectation that the term 'game' which involves 'play' implies that fun is to be had. Freedom: The Underground Railroad forced me to reassess this expectation. Why should a game about freeing slaves be fun? It shouldn't. Slavery is the antithesis of fun and a game that would make it fun would be an abomination. F:tUR is a game that is good, but not fun, which is as it should be, but it may not be the kind of game I prefer to play.

A good, well-constructed, albeit headache-inducing, cooperative game.

As all players get to play each turn, winning the game is not only dependent on doing all the available actions, but doing them in the optimum sequence. This added layer of planning stretches the game's 8 turns into hours of play time.

----------------Preliminary thoughts----------------

Very clever game, with a generous degree of decisions and that manages to keep a constant tension.

I love some of the mechanics (buy the 10 gold useless chips to advance the era, etc.) It has many things to love.

I do not rate it higher because I think the strategy is rather obvious. You just choose how much you want to push your luck.

The theme is relatively well integrated, but not perfectly (why do you lose slaves at plantations if they are full?).

Definitely a detailed game.  Look and feel is outstanding.  A themed, educational game.  The game reinforces a philosophy that I agree with: Important to remember your history…or you’re doomed to repeat it…  As to the game,  the game play is strategic, and you need to make decisions together on each players turn.  (Like pandemic)  At our game table, our groups consensus was that the rules could be improved… made to be easier to understand.  The learning curve felt too steep.   We played the game multiple times over a week period, and had to do research some our questions on the rules.  Another problem with the game, is that all of us felt the game went on for too long.  We did manage to win, although the game seemed to reward us (by allowing us to win) if we made the choice to allow some slaves to be captured – letting some be killed by the slave owners…  which, of course, left a bad feeling in our souls.  Ahhh, is that a good lesson for the game dynamics to reinforce?

A good, historical coop game with an awesome theme. Whether you like it or not will depend on your opinion about coop games - some people love them and other people hate them. I enjoy them and the theme gets you to be emotionally attached to the wooden cubes representing the slaves (Yeah, that's weird!). For example, I actually felt bad when the slave catcher caught the slaves I was trying to get across the border. Even when I "won" the game, I still felt bad for the "slaves" that I was not able to save. 

Given the theme, fun is probably the wrong word to associate with this game. It is historical, compelling and the mechanics match the theme but I felt emotionally drained by the end of the game. Good game, good history and creates a narrative that you remember long after the game is over.

Freedom: The Underground Railroad is a cooperative game in which players are trying to help slaves in the American South escape to Canada in the period before the American Civil War.  Each turn, players draft two tokens--one type of tokens moves slaves, another earns a player money depending on the position of slaves on the board, and a third allows a player to spend money to advance the game.  Patrolling the various cities between the deep south and Canada are a number of slave catchers who will send slaves back to the boat if they end up on the same space.  The slave catchers move in a predetermined manner that can be manipulated by clever players.  The game also features a deck of historical events, most of which can be purchased by the players and provide special abilities.  However, some of these are negative events which must be dealt with; the ones that end up coming up provide some nice game-to-game variation.  While cooperative games aren't my preferred plays style, this game provided enough historical interest and clever gameplay to keep my interest.

Historic and does so in a educational and none offensive sense. I kind of got into the mechanics more than theme with this one, but if you really sat down and thought out it, it was pretty crazy. We won our first game, but we also mildly cheated in the beginning as we screwed up the event cards and had 3 bad ones to start. 

I'd play it again, but I'm not going out of my way to play it again.

As an antidote to the Colonialism games where players profit from the slave trade, this is a game about transporting slaves to freedom (in Canada, not the US North - but you'd know that if you'd followed the Dred Scott judgement of the Supreme Court). Solitaire version is quite tough.

Theme is 0 in this game. Maybe because of the lack of some good components, this feels like a 100% pure abstract game. And for me theme is important in a co-operative game: I have to feel that I'm fighting evil, curing diseases,... This feels more like a game of Rush Hour, but then longer.

[First Play] Theme-driven co-op game that manages to integrate good mechanics with gut-wrenching tension. The integration of historical information is smooth and had us looking for the flavour text on every card. It was interesting to note that we never even entertained the notion of a "sacrifice play" like we would in most other cooperative games. They may be plain wooden cubes in the box but when they enter the game they become something more -- which is as it should be given the theme. I would say this alone is a sign of the game's success.

Highly thematic and engrossing. Very difficult to win. I have to say it is a heavy theme but rewarding to play. I really liked it and added it to the wishlist. Well done to Brian for having a successful game like this, very impressive.

Co-op, Heavily theme dictated mechanics, but also a bit heavy emotionally. Some find game play connects below the surface and can create a certain amount of anguish. Educational (a la Twilight Struggle) with real events, people, etc infused into play.
Game setup is fixed, so it lacks some variety with repeated play.

[b]Comment:[/b] A very enjoyable game where players as a team have to try to get enough cubes out of the lower half of the board, into the upper half while still gathering enough dollars to be able to buy the victory tokens. The theme here is heavy, but I enjoyed being able to purchase action cards that summoned the influence of great civil rights heroes to save the day in a pinch.

A remarkable game.  Perhaps the first time I've ever had a genuine emotional response to "losing" a piece of wood.  Unless you count that time in college, but I had been drinking a ton, and that girl's breath smelled of what I imagine one of those tropical flowers that are redolent of carrion would smell like.  And to be honest, I wasn't really that attracted to her to begin with...she sort of followed me to my room.  So, I can hardly be blamed for that, right?  Right??!
Great board game, regardless.  

Edit 04/15:  Just too depressing to play very often.  Still think it is great, but doesn't get played nearly enough for it to stand out in an increasingly packed field of quality Euros.

A very, very good game that manages to tackle a very difficult theme in a tasteful way. Only problem is that it feels incredibly painful to lose people that you were trying to help to freedom. Seems pretty much impossible to avoid losing some along the way though, so definitely a game with some very difficult moments.

This game is great for giving you the feeling of an operator on the Underground Railroad.  Unfortunately that feeling is less "having fun" and more "the horror and despair of this situation makes me want to hang myself."  Extraordinarily intense co-op puzzle.  But makes you sacrifice slaves to save other slaves.

Great group game (co-op).  This game is extremely hard to win.  In fact, I never did after many plays.  So I made some house rules which are listed in the files section.  Now I can control the balance and actually have a chance to win at the game. 

You start out thinking you are winning so easily at this game and then about 1/2 way through, the game will kick your butt.  And it progressively gets tougher each turn.  And there are only 8 turns.  By the end, you get creamed if you even get to the 8 turns.  Ok, this is what I don't like.

What I do like is that the game requires some amazing strategy thinking.  Everyone who played this put a tremendous amount of thought energy into the game and had a blast doing so.  

There are lots of things you have to worry about and figure out to do and the group really worked together to make this happen.  Of course, with all co-op games like this, you have to watch out for the dominant player who will want to tell everyone how to do their moves.  But we make a rule to keep your mouth shut as much as possible.  So a balance of letting the players interact but trying to restrict the dominant person from running the game is what we try to accomplish.  

The great thing with this game is you can do that because there are so many things to figure out and no one will know it all anyway, so it humbles you while playing.  At least with novice players of this game.

The rule book is one of the best.  I really don't know why so many are asking for rule clarifications because I had none.  That is how good the rule book is.  Very easy to figure out this game and explain it to others.  

A great experience.

A cooperative game where the players try to move slaves from the Southern states to Canada.
The game looks really great and I really like how the slave catcher are patrolling the roads. They are really a head ache when you want to manouvre many slaves towards the North.
Resources are scarse. The game really forces players to convene. This is a great tough game. I am looking forward to a next challenge!

Ignoring the heavy theme for a second, this is an interesting take on a co-op game that doesn't play the exact same way as all the other popular co-ops. I really enjoyed the puzzle of having to avoid the slave-catchers during your current turn while trying to plan ahead for future avoidance. I also really enjoy the cards that are used in the game which have both positive and negative impact on your success. Back to the theme, obviously very heavy and not for everyone, but implemented extremely well. The gameplay mechanisms make sense thematically and all the historical info on the cards just adds to the whole experience. Just a great game overall.

It runs a bit long. Overall, it is an amazing theme with an educational aspect that is great. Production is great. The system is challenging. I just don't really like co-op games enough to play a 2 hour game. Co-ops over 50 minutes, no matter how great their systems are, just don't make the cut. I still really appreciate this game, and if you like co-ops give this one a try. It has a lot less hidden information than others.

This is a really easy to learn puzzle game with a spectacular and unique theme.  You really feel like your trying to slip slaves by and sometimes is very close or it looks really bleak and suddenly a card comes up and bam!  A ray of hope. 

This is a tough game but at the easier level is not impossible.  I was very lucky to win on my first game but I don't expect this to happen as just the right cards came out my last two rounds for me to win otherwise I would have lost in the last round. 

Fun, puzzle-y type game that is pretty fast to setup and plays in an hour solo.

This game was done exceptionally well. When i first heard the name and that it was coop, I cringed, hoping that it was NOT an all against one game with someone playing the opposition...which would have been WRONG.

No need to worry, the game is a fantastic pure coop, with real historical characters and events.  The economic weight of the underground railroad is felt as the players try to support their mission to free people in every way possible.  It is a very strategic game.  I have to admit I hate losing this one more than a normal game, but it creates renewed respect for the people who championed this cause.

[i]Extremely[/i] limiting co-op play.  You play this game the way it wants you to.  I found that very unsatisfying particulary since I played 1775 just prior, which provided an incredible amount of free will.

A fine subject matter that would have been better addressed at a smaller, more personal scope.  As it stands you feel like a cog in a machine, one not likely to produce an uplifting result.

I was excited to try a game about such a touchy subject matter. Would it affect how I play, having each piece potentially represent a real person in such a horrific situation, a situation that my own ancestors were part of creating?

I'd held off on playing this as I wanted my daughter to be old enough to handle the subject matter and she is my primary co-op game partner.  I'm glad that we finally got it to the table, though.  I'm not usually a fan of puzzly type games, but this one is great.  The slave catcher mechanics, opposition cards, sacrifices are all well-implemented and the designer has displayed incredible sensitivity to a difficult and sensitive topic.  This is a solid 8 with room to increase.  My daughter is 8 and loved her first play of it and is looking forward to playing it again.

RATING: 3.5
First impression: a more thematic Pandemic. 

Let me explain: Pandemic was for me a game of executive level of theme representation. You're having an office meeting, the shit hits the fan and now you have to solve the situation by everybody doing what they do best. Similarly in Freedom, there's really no "I" in the game. It's a group puzzle with discussion of plans. But instead of a team of specialists (Pandemic), there's a team of human trafficking organisers. 

There are two main intersecting parts of the game. 
One is the cat and mouse game of moving cubes to safety away from hunters running around. And here is what I'd say is the thematic heart of the game which is really about human trafficking or illegal trafficking in general (you try to deliver shipments without them being caught). The other part of the game is in maintaining some sort of economic engine. It's the scoring however (or what the game rewards) which brings home the picture of benevolent human traffickers. 

For me, an European, with no previous knowledge of the theme, the worked mainly on cerebral level - though associations on similar geopolitical situations I'm more familiar with (like Albanian mafia trafficking immigrants from Kosovo wars into European Union though Slovenian territory). And connecting the game with things I know certainly game me something to ponder about. As I wasn't familiar with the topic of game beforehand, the emotional part didn't really impact me. Apart from identification of a cube with a person which did its magic: [i]while we were always talking about sacrificing one cube to save others, we avoided it till the very end.[/i] At the end, the problem is that the representation is at  an executive level - I didn't feel like I was in the field, rather I was in a meeting of human traffickers trying to work together. 

About replayability. 
It's collective puzzle, so it might get samey. However the topicality makes it an interesting experience. So you could go for my angle - following a train of associations while playing; or you could get emotionally invested into the story and a feeling of doing "a right thing". 

Summary: 
Rating reflects my level of interest co-ops, especially this type. Theme is interesting and the mechanical core could be applied to other more contemporary and provocative issues of trafficking. However there is a bit of disconnect between the extrovert collective discussion on the operational level and the thematic representation which works through introspection (feeling or thinking about the issues presented in the game). Which is why it might even work best as a solo game(?).

[1 play] Most co-op games don't work for me. This one actually worked in that manner better than most, but fell flat for me regardless.

I give the makers points for the theme, lots of historical flavor for anyone who wants to experience it at that level, and beautiful components with a solid game system.

Freedom: The Underground Railroad is an excellent cooperative game.  It's engaging, difficult, and thought-provoking.  On the surface, the subject matter and the idea of it being turned into a game shouldn't work together, they actually do.  Yes, it's a game, but it's thematic, immersive, and historic.  I enjoy playing it, but wouldn't say that it's "fun" in the usual sense of that word.  "Satisfying" is probably the better way to describe how I feel about playing this game. I really give the designer and publisher a lot of credit tackling this subject matter and making it work. Kudos! Keep up the great work!

An excellent production with a respectful, well-researched theme. Unfortunately, it's far too difficult. While I appreciate that certain elements are abstract, I am unable to separate the idea that these are supposed to be people. While it may be optimal to sacrifice one slave cube to move three others, it's just something I can't do. Perhaps if it were out of my hands when something like that happens (like with the die rolls), then I wouldn't have that much of an issue. Additionally, the game doesn't seem particularly balanced across player counts or character abilities. If I want something this challenging, I'll play Ghost Stories.

One play. Just trying to digest the rules at this point. Playing solitaire (but with three "players") I actually came close to winning but I suspect I may have been making some careless errors in my favor. There are a number of little adjustments to keep track of (when you get income, etc) and some of them allow for some flexibility, which is good for tactical thinking, but makes it possible to overlook a rule one is unfamiliar with. For a history nerd like myself, the game is impressive. It also has some moral weight to it. You don't like having to give up slaves to the slave catchers.

RATING: 7
This is a well-designed game that I would play if requested, but doubt it will ever be requested.  I'm personally not a history buff so all the effort they made to make the game historically accurate and teach players about the events portrayed in the game is wasted on me and the game actually comes off as kind of dry.  Despite the hype about this game I probably would have never played it if it wasn't suggested by a friend who owned a copy.

From a gameplay point of view though, this game is very thinky and offers a lot of interesting decisions.  Each turn players are trying to get slaves from southern plantations through a maze of slave catchers to Canada where they will be free.  Also, players need to make enough money to buy a number of "support tokens" before 8 rounds run out or players lose by having too many slaves captured.  I'm not sure what these support tokens represent thematically but it's nice to have two different victory conditions to focus on and offers a nice other layer to gameplay.

The other piece where you are trying to navigate these slaves through a maze of slave catchers offers a lot of interesting decisions as well.  At the end of each round more slaves will be placed in the plantations so you need to empty them enough to make room for more (any extras are automatically "caught") and moving into a slave catchers path pulls them toward a slave so you have to pull them around in order to get your slaves safely into Canada.  Sometimes you need to sacrifice some slaves though in order to accomplish your goals, sort of "for the greater good".  You won't really succeed at the game if you don't and can see pretty early on that this is a necessary part of gameplay.  This might be very sensitive for some players and completely turn them off of the game.  But of course the game's whole subject matter is somewhat sensitive.

I felt, at lest with 2 players, that this game was pretty easy.  I will say we did have a couple lucky rolls but even still we won the game a few turns early and with very few slaves caught and passing the freed slaves requirement by a few as well and probably would have won even without the lucky rolls.  This is in direct opposition to what I've heard, that this is one of the harder coops out there.

Great co-operative game with almost a 'puzzle' feel. Really challenging to win, too. Theme off-putting for some, but we found it actually enlightening and because of thinking about the theme, the last time I was in Liverpool I visited the slavery museum which is a sobering but recommended experience.

An excellent game for those who like a dash of historical accuracy and simulation.  As a co-op this is a great game with plenty of difficult decisions made more so by the theme itself.  Tons of historical information further adds to one's understanding of this difficult period in American history.

Plays quickly, easy to learn but not easy to master. 
Some confusion over what are blue/green city/spaces (important for fund raising). 
Very nice production values. Good replay value with handful of different characters and a large variety of cards (including expansions). Luck factor is medium. Outstanding theme.

RATING: 8
Rating after playing six solo games with each of the roles. Very tough to beat (which of course is good for a solo game). Some of the theme breaks down if you look too closely, but that's easy to overlook given the detail of the historical cards and the excellent game play overall. Once you know the game, it can be played solo in only 30 minutes, and resetting the game is fast, too. I need to find some meeples to replace the slave catcher tokens which blend into the board. Did I mention the solo game is really hard? Only win was on the easy level, and two of my losses on the normal level were very close (one by a single cube -- Lincoln just couldn't overcome Dred Scott).

I might rate this a 10 if I find I'm pulling it off the shelf a lot.

Picked up for $35 at the HPB.  I've played solo once so far. I enjoyed it, but the topic is tough. And it's a little bit of a brain burner overall. Tentatively giving it a 7. I'll re-evaluate after playing with others.

Update: Still a 7, after a second play with 2 players.  My solo game was a win. We lost the second play.  The theme is strong...but thankfully not TOO strong.

The theme is very interesting and thought provoking, and I appreciate that the way the game designs makes you think about the topic seriously.  However, it's basically a team puzzle game with time pressure.  That's not really the type of game I enjoy, but since I like the theme, I wouldn't mind playing again.

RATING: 7
The obvious comparable is the venerable Pandemic, though Freedom involves players moving streams of cubes off the map rather than Pandemic where players pluck off static cubes.  

Freedom has a much more interesting theme with more historical specificity than Pandemic, largely thanks to the Abolitionist cards.  

However, I think Pandemic might do a better job of increasing tension as the game unfolds due to the Infection deck, whereas the final round of Freedom seems to lack drama.  It is just so calculable once the slave catchers have moved.  Freedom could probably use a bit more random elements to keep it from feeling like a puzzle.

Initial plays are positive. A lot of co-ops now feel like they're using the same formula, but this one really has its own feeling. On each turn you have several different types of actions you can take and every turn you try to figure out how maximize all of those actions to your advantage. This is different from something like Pandemic where you might regularly do the same things over and over (move, clear up some cubes, move again, clear up some more cubes).

I just wonder how this will hold up in the long run. Because the board is pretty tight, it has the potential to play out similarly each time. Of course the cards and the order they come out can greatly alter this.

As a solo experience I feel like every game plays out very similar.  Basically if you play very very well you will reduce to the game to the luck of the draw.  If you get bombarded with the wrong bad events at the wrong time you're hosed and if you get the right cards at the right time you might win.  In that way it's very similar to Knizia's LotR game.  Do the best you can and pray the event draws don't ruin you.

I understand that the solo version is supposed to be the hardest way to play but in a group I think I'd much rather play Pandemic, and I'm usually and absolute sucker of historical chrome.

RATING: 4.5
First Impression:
A thematic co-op game with a politically correct theme.

What I liked the most about this game is the clear sense of progression and danger in the board. You can really see how well you do and where your runaway slaves are in danger of getting caught. Other than that, there is definately a puzzle like type of tactics/strategy with several option to help it.

On the other side, the game is fiddly, too complicated for the experience it offers and a lot of the mechanics feel pasted on and forced. The cooperation between players is also and unfortunatelly extremelly thin, as this puzzle type game could easily have been a solo game - alpha players are going to love it.

I would give it another try though.

In [thing=119506][/thing] players are trying to free slaves from the south of USA, leading them to Canada. To do this, they use conductors, to move the slaves north, and fundraising, to sustain the advancement of the struggle to abolish slavery. Basically, player lead slaves from the plantations on the south towards the north, trying to reach Canada, avoiding, along the way, the slave catchers. In all the rounds of the game more slaves enter the plantations, coming from the slave markets - if there isn't enough room for them, slaves start to be lost, and if a given number, depending on the number of players, is reached, the game ends in defeat. The play will never pass the end of the 8th round - if the players haven't won by this point (reaching a certain amount of slaves freed and support gained), they also lose.

The gameplay has five phases:
1) Slave catchers movement phase: the two dice are rolled to see which slave catcher (if any) will move and how further he will go;

2) Planning phase: each player may take [b]up to two tokens[/b]. There are three types of tokens: conductor (to move slaves); fundraising (to gain money); support (player need to buy all the support tokens in order to win the game). Support and conductor tokens costs money, while fundraising is free to take.

3) Action phase: players may do any of actions, in any order they want.
- play a conductor or fundrasing token;
- play a second conductor or fundrasing token;
- use the benefit of the role (each player is a character, with special benefits);
- buy and resolve one Abolitionist card;
- use the once per game ability of the role.

The conductor tokens allow the players to move a certain number of slaves one or two spaces each (for example, in the first period - 1800-39 - the conductor tokens is 3/1, allowing the player to move up to 3 slaves one space each). When the slave cube enters a space that passes by the line of hunt of a slave catcher, the corresponding token of the catcher move towards the cube one space. The fundraising tokens provide money, accordingly to the number of slaves cubes in some places in the south (for the first and second periods of the game) or in the north (for the third period - 1860-65). 

4) Slave market phase: slave cubes move from the bottom card from the market to the plantations. Players can put the cubes in whatever spot they want, but if there isn't enough space for all the cubes, they excess go to the slaves lost track. The other cards from the market are slided down, and a new one is revealed at the top, and filled with cubes.

5) Lantern phase: the Abolitionists cards are slided to the right (if there is a card in the rightmost spot of the track, it leaves play, activating if it is an Opposition card). Players check for victory condition. If the game continues, new cards are drawn from the deck of the period to fill the empty spaces in the track. First player token moves clockwise. 

[thing=119506][/thing] is highly thematic, with the flow of the game following three distinc periods of time (1800-39; 1840-59; 1860-65), each with its own deck of set of cards (and each card has a few lines to explain the role the event/person/place had - a really nice addition, specially for a person, like myself, that isn't all that well familiar with US history), in order to stay true to the historic events, persons and places. The conductor and fundraising tokens also change due to the period the game is. The period advances once all the support tokens (each costs $10) are bought by the players. All the care taken here is top notch.

Also, [thing=119506][/thing] is beautiful to look at, with a clean design that works in almost all the ways. However, I have two peeves with the graphic design: first, the spot with an image above the plantations. It is just an illustration, not an actual place to put slaves that are fleeing the plantations. It says so in the rulebook. But why, oh, why to put it in front of the plantions, and not behind or bellow? So easy to be done, and would actually help players instead of creating an opportunity to cause mistakes (and, of course that we did this error during our first play). Second, in the slave market cards totally should have extra squares, maybe in a different color, apart from the usual squares by a line or something, with a small setence above them: [i]Slaves catched[/i]. Again, the rulebook is correct about where the slaves cubes go once taken by the slave catchers, but as there wasn't more space in the cards, we went with the idea that slaves catched went directly to the Slaves Lost track. The mistakes were mine, but the graphic design is at its best once it helps as much as possible the players.

Anyaway, [thing=119506][/thing] works pretty darn well, beign easy to learn and to teach (the actions are all straightfoward), and offers a fine and tense puzzle for the players to deal with. More than once we stayed several minutes pondering about moves of the slaves, considering not only the current move, but the next ones. It was agonizing, sometimes, to see that, in order to went foward, one cube would be lost (but, when playing by the proper rules, this was much less dire, as though the slave might be lost anyway, we could do something about it). We stayed talking possibilites and let deep sighs when someone added "but then this catcher will go here and we won't be able to move these", or "this might work, but if you do this, my fundraise action will be much worst". The game unfolds and reveals an amazing and difficult struggle against slavery, something we cannot forget nor repeat, ever.

To sum it up, everyone that played, liked [thing=119506][/thing]. In two days we played three times, and I bet several more will come along the way. Recommended.

I'm still trying to figure out what I think about the game -- it's very much an abstraction, and it does bleed a bit into "white savior" complex, but at the same time, it's pretty hard to come up with a game around this type of subject in the first place (it's not quite an election or even a wargame). 

As a game, there's a lot of intense decisions that go into it -- it's probably not the most innovative system on its own, but it's never meant to be just a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A difficult co-op game of movement and economics, the mechanics and gameplay themselves are fine. However, I take issue with the theme. I feel a sour taste in my mouth while playing this game. Maybe it's the notion that slaves, PEOPLE's lives, are strategized to be either more and less important than money or phase goals. We as players are very much separate from the reality of the slave trade of the past, even the slave worker tokens themselves are mere wooden cubes, not even meeples to signify they're symbolic humanity. Though we play as the "good guys", death of people who were commodities is in our hands. None of the other folks I played with took issue, but I did and do. There is a line, and this crossed it.

From BGG Secret Santa 2017

A very fun, but tense, historical co-op. There's a fair bit of planning to do in the game, and there's a great balancing act between spending and saving money. Losing slave cubes is a very tough thing to happen, and you want every last cube to make it to Canada! It reminds me of a slightly more complex, and much more significant, Pandemic. 

The only downside is the abstracted slave catcher tokens (probably for the best, though) that are hard to notice when pondering safe moves. The great klkitchens has some 3D models available to print in the forums, however.

Okay co-op that sadly feels like both some aspects of game design and theme were left halfway. Felt like this could actually be rethemed to become a real "train" game instead of a metaphorical "railroad" game. I mean you transport cubes and get money for stopping them in towns, you have to collect wealth to win(buying the support tokens which I felt was a cheap patch mechanic to make the game difficult) etc.. Anyhow, the game might become too focused on a "best strategy" in the long run as there is extremely little hidden information. While my first game was fun I think it was thanks to the company and I can't give the game credit for that. Also, what is with half-assing the theme, we all know that the cubes represent black slaves, why could the cubes not be black or brown then, the questionable theme has already been chosen, making them almost white just seems like a cheap decision and deterred from theme for me. A pimped version with "slaveples" would have been better at getting me into the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An well-thought-out examination of a difficult topic, dressed up with excellent components and gorgeous period-specific art.   The thematic touches are all over, from the antique styling of the map to the 1800s newspaper look for the events, to the cards featuring individuals and policies that shaped the politics of slavery in the 1800s.  The theme really pops, and it is heartbreaking to have one of the escapees caught.  The game walks a fine line successfully -- it treats enslaved persons with dignity and respect without trivializing the struggle.  It's a well-done treatment.

Mechanically, the game is fairly straightforward.  There's a slave-catcher mechanic which acts like a web to keep the players from moving the escapees to Canada effectively.  You have limited control over the movement of the slavecatchers, so you can use the escapees to disrupt the web and let a few people through.   The game has a bit of that cooperative puzzle feel, sort of like [gameid=30549].  It's definitely on the easy side for a good group, so I'd suggest for most gamers that they play with the difficult rules, and consider the optional rules to make it even more difficult.

This is a fun co-op game-play wise.  But one can't talk about this game without the weight of the subject matter.  Where this "space refugees" I wouldn't rate it any better or worse  but I don't think I'd think about it twice.  However, I think I wouldn't have had so many little wince inducing moments "if we do this that slave dies but that one lives."  Why theme matters in this game and nothing - no theme- has ever bothered me in the slightest ever before is interesting.  It definitely makes one think of the historical situation.  I appreciate that this game generates such thought.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is essentially a race against the slavers resupplying the pens across the Southern states before the Abolitionists can release them onwards to freedom in Canada. We may have been generous in collecting funds to support de railroad, as 'Abo Pete' did his best to enforce the slavers tracking our runaways but the tactics would have to change to stand any chance of achieving the required number of slaves being released successfully. I imagine players would have to heard them all out and hope sheer numbers would crate a 'target-rich environment'. Each player has a one-use special ability and can also, once per turn, move a slave counter towards freedom and collect $1. There are tokens that can be purchased to give extra movement potential to escapees and adverse cards will appear at some stage as they move along the track. I think the mechanisms are good and there is definitely a major challenge involved in achieving the objective. I am looking forward to the expansion(s).

Light cooperative puzzler. I will not play this game any other way but solitaire. The game comes with great components and looks really good. The rules are light, clear, and very sensible.

Although this is a light game there are many tough decisions to be made.

I wasn't nearly as smitten with this game as everyone else seems to be. I love the theme, love the historical context and all the information provided by the cards themselves. What I didn't love was the overly simplistic mechanics. Too many cards were just move one block two spaces or two blocks one space. A lot of the effects didn't feel appropriate to the person or event they were meant to represent, instead just being a boring movement point or two.

I know some folks have had a gut wrenching attachment to those little cubes, but for whatever reason I just didn't come away with that feeling. It seemed like a math game, more than a historical simulation.

This should be rated "6" for how fun it is.
And rated "10" for how engaging it is.

You don't play freedom because it's fun.
Well, it is fun, but this is one of those rare games where "fun" isn't the core engagement.

This is a game where history, stress, and urgency to save lives are what matters.

This is an exhausting and sometimes depressing game to play.
It puts you in the shoes of people trying to balance the lives of enslaved people versus the destruction of slavery.

Fun? Yeah, it's a good puzzle.
Worthwhile?  Extraordinarily.  

Here are some of the things that have happened to me:
* at turn six of eight, i got so depressed that I gave up.  I could have save more people, but the death got to me.  i can imagine abolitionists struggling to keep up the fight in the face of opposition
* in another game, on the turn we "won", it wasn't enough to reach victory conditions.  we also had to save as many people as possible, and we lingered over the board to save more cubes.  you can't help but think of them as real people.

We need more games like this.

This is a solid game with top-notch component quality and mechanics that are well integrated with the theme. My rating reflects that, as a more introspective game, it isn't as likely to hit the table as something more "exciting" or fast-paced.

The flavor text is great, and is simple enough to play with middle school kids. I love its portrayal of a sensitive historical issue.

Great co-op game.  Even without the theme, it is a fantastic game that plays differently every time.  It might not be as good as pandemic, but it's the closest in quality that I've yet played.  

One plus over Pandemic is that it plays up to 5 players without 1 being against you.  The other is all of the cards and events are based on historical fact, and that makes it special.

This is the "other" math-heavy coop, with the first being the Lord of the Rings living card game.  I just don't see how [i]Freedom[/i] is in any way superior to LoTR. It's more deterministic, less tense, misses the spark of player creativity (e.g., pre-game deck building), and has less replayability.  Though it's far cheaper, since buying into LoTR is the monetary equivalent of loaning your credit card to your junkie nephew.

As long as I'm confessing, I'll add that [i]Freedom[/i] left me feeling exhausted - grossly analogous to my days of working on a Northern California highway in 100 degree heat.  It passed the time, sure, and kept me in good shape. But I only did it for the money, not for fun.

I also don't see the comparison to [i]Pandemic[/i].  At all. That's a good thing, by the way, since no one needs to own or play a near-duplicate of another game.

Definitely not a purchase, though I'd try again with more players to see if I missed anything.  The gutsy, original theme is to be applauded, but unfortunately that's where my admiration ends.

I thought I would *love* this game. Partly as I can appreciate the historic lesson, and the fact that I really like coops like Pandemic. Here you can lure out the slave catchers, but at times it feels too mechanical.

There's a lot in this game, and a lot of thought needed to play it, but it's actually quite simple in rules terms. Buy tokens to move slave counters point-to-point out of the Southern plantations up to Canada, dodging the Slave Catchers who move towards Slaves every time they cross the Slave Catcher's route. Earn money for moving them out & North, and use more cash to buy cards with various powers to assist in some part of the process. Meanwhile, more Slaves appear each turn to fill the plantations, and if they overflow, you lose...

So, you have to move slaves out every turn, move them north to make room for the ones moving out, dodge slave catchers, and earn money to do all that. All at once...

The game seems to scale pretty well, but it really has to be a very cooperative co-op game!

Have played this once and enjoyed it. I think it's going to be a hard one to win. A brave theme to cover which works well. Interesting reading the historical text on the cards as you go along. I would say this is probably the heaviest (in both theme AND mechanics) co-op game I've played

The best word to describe this game is elegant. Every mechanism in this game makes sense and is therefore easy to understand. The game is hard, but not unbeatable. Additionally is is simply beautiful.

Pese a haberlo probado con una partida que no llegamos ni a terminar, este juego me ha encantado. Caja pequeña, componentes tirando a feuchos pero resultones, reglas sencillas y muy buen desarrollo del juego. Turnos rápidos, negociación, conquista, cierto puteo, mayorías, este juego mezcla un poco de todo. Muy estratégico, hay 4 imperios que van desarrollando los jugadores, y donde se van construyendo galeras y ciudades, que puntuarán más en el imperio más grande. Decisiones a largo plazo, los jugadores no se quedan rezagados. Descatalogado y difícil de encontrar, esa es la pega.

We are canny Phoenician traders building cities in expanding Mediterranean empires.  Cards are the essential currency for both building and moving. There is Settlers-ish trading to help you put together the necessary sets.  Expansion of the empires is sort of player controlled but fairly chaotic, particularly with four players. Turns are quick, so there's little down time.  While Tyros lacks the spark to make it a really compelling game, I remain quite fond of it.

Artwork and production are functional.  The rules do leave you to figure out one or two things for yourself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the game idea of the expanding Phoenician trade empire and it's game mechanics. On the other hand the division of the gameboard in rectangles looks odd for an historical wargamer.

I wish this game was a little more developed into a more historical game that takes a little longer.

RATING: 7
Not your typical Martin Wallace game, this game does not feel particularly thematic beyond the fact that you are sailing and building things in the Mediterranean.  The card play is decent and interesting as are the spatial aspects.  The card trading mechanic, not surprisingly, allows for a bit too much king making potential.  Fun for sure, but also not entirely fair to the other players who suffer from the trade you just made.

Acquire with movement and "Mediterranean Trading"
This is a really clever little game. The way the empires expand is like acquire (placing tiles) and then you must "invest" in the empires by setting up trading posts. To get the resources you need to trade and deal just like settlers.
The Med theme works quite well.

i'm sick of playing martin wallace games that feel like prototypes - way out west, liberte, princes of the renaissance, etc.  great elements in all of them, but lots of rust that you can see clearly after just one play.  even age of steam has the kinda bonerific production action.  but anyway, back to tyros.  tile draw/play is sucky.  a draft would be better.  the trading phase might as well not exist, because it's almost never going to happen.  the game in general just isn't that interesting.  most of all, the card luck is an insane factor, especially on the last turn.  perhaps i'd give it another shot after reading the rules to make sure we weren't missing something huge, but every time i do that with the others i'm still disappointed with the bad parts.

What seems like an interesting game crashes pretty hard after a few plays. With this game, Martin Wallace has finally outlasted his welcome in my collection. Yet another game with some interesting ideas and grossly insufficient development. The last few turns are typically a complete waste, and there is relatively little you can do to control things in the game. An interesting concept that turned out to be truly bad.  Virtually every Martin Wallace game has had interesting ideas but showstopping bugs that show up after only a handful of plays (except Vollfampf and maybe Liberte, which were simply uninteresting).

9 plays (1x3p, 8x4p).  Good game! Pros: I like the card handling choices on the map, familiar mechanic of trading with players, original and strategic mechanic of influencing the growth of the four nonplayer empires for strong impact on the final scoring. More Pros: Little ships, nice map, area control, trading. The manipulated growth of the four nonplayer empires is a fresh element, something I haven't seen in other games. I think that in particular is the stamp of Wallace-shaped originality here. Cons: Not much - just that there are some "fine print" rules that aren't bad rules but they're difficult to remember when learning. For example, it costs five suit cards plus your ship to build a city if you one one galley there, or four suit cards plus a ship if you have two galleys there. Another example, in the four player game only, you do two rounds of empire placement the first round, and only one round of empire placement in subsequent rounds. Update on the cons: I don't see what my problem was with them--just needed more experience with the game. Conclusion: I like this one a lot.  I think Tyros is a keeper, one that deserves regular play.

RATING: 6
This game does not feel like any game I own. Its got some area control parts, mixed with hand management, negotiation and positional play on the board. With 3 players we didn't find that trading between players happened a lot. With 4 players, the trading just never developed like I'd hoped it might.

On the whole, I think my rating could rise. I suspect it loses a little with only 3 players. I also find this game to have a very unique feel to it among my collection. Its a bit dry, but I don't mind dry games. If Leo Colovini had designed this it wouldn't have suprised me at all.

Update: Repeat playings have not improved my opinion. This is not among Wallace's most appealing games. Its too long for what it is, so it will be hard to get to the table.

Tyros is not a game which I played a lot despite its attractive subject, and it took me a while to work out why: the scoring. Figuring out how many points you'll be getting is not an easy task, and if you just sail around and build cities (as I did), you are (or so I thought) not playing the game correctly. You should focus on a subset of the trade empires, and keep in mind the bonus awarded for having the largest number of cities there. You can then also assign a relative value to the trade cards instead of just trading them 1 on 1. 

However, repeated playing with the above in mind still led to a somewhat lackluster experience. The main problem I've encountered is that people tend to prefer trading with the stack to trading with other humans—at least in my groups—because they are after a [i]specific[/i] type of card. If the other players indicate they don't have such cards or do not want to trade under the stated conditions, the trade stack is the only option left to you. Being allowed to carry over just three cards from a previous round also isn't helping very much: there's quite a bit of tactical play involved, and a plan of building a lot of cities in a small empire may strand because that empire becomes the biggest of the lot, or because you don't get the right cards to see that plan through. There is very little you can do about this save for trading like a maniac with the draw deck before it runs out. The trading with other players which is supposed to make the game a bit more interesting simply does not work very well here.

I will not go as far to condemn the game, because if you change your expectations, the game is still a friendly and thematically interesting card game. I will concede that for such simplicity the scoring is far too convoluted, and that to date, none of the games I played involved the other players knowing their scores until the end. Tyros seems to be more about a little hand management until someone is rather unexpectedly declared winner rather than a clever excercise in logistics optimisation.

Not a favourite, but not quite bad either, although I suspect it will be many, many years ere I play it again after I've finished with this comment.

[b]Update[/b] Many years indeed: without having an actual box to play with that's rather hard. The game has left my collection in search of greener pastures.

[b]Update 2[/b] Upon replaying I noticed: Little long term-planning due to the limited card carry-over; trading with the stack; and really quite an opaque scoring which makes it very hard to properly guesstimate the effect of having ships and cities here and there across the map. Even if you manage to fix the dreary draw stack digging, the difficult to deal with scoring remains. I sincerely hope that this was the last time ever I played this rightfully forgotten title.

I think I screwed myself somewhat due to early misplays. I'll have to play again.

Simultaneously, I'm turned off by the manner in which you can stop others from building cities - creating a sort of stalemate in which it would be disadvantageous for either of you to leave the area first, whilst the other players gain advantage.

RATING: 6
Better with 3 players than 4.
There's quite a bit of randomness and not much a player can do to overcome it. Whether the empires you have cards for will grow depends on whether you get lucky with the right tiles. And your ability to do anything useful will depend on what cards you draw. Yes, you can trade cards with other players, but if you dont have many cards for the mega-Empire you aren't likely to get them from another player.
The only saving grace is your ability to trade with the deck until you get a workable hand. But there's aren't many cards in the deck with 4 players. There's enough with 3. :-)

RATING: 6.5
This is a relatively short empire building game with very simple rules, some randomness (but not too much) and lots and tension during every turn. It's pretty much underrated on the BGG, perhaps also due to a slight misinterpretation of the rules (you CAN move over the neutral spaces, you only mustn't end your move there) from quite a few of the players, although in saying all that, it does seem like the game is somewhat in need of a further development, since the trading does not really work as intended, and a bad card draw can sometimes leave you with nothing to do for a couple of turns.  So, a rough diamond, shall we say?

Players are Phonecians (?) that use cards to build ships and move them to four independant kingdoms and try to found cities there.  Cards build ships, move ships, and build cities - so cards are everything!  A whiff of Acquire in there as you try to make sure your cities are in the largest kingdoms.  Good fun.

RATING: 6
An overlooked game by Wallace of expanding into four empires. Uses set collection. Great tension, as each player takes one action in turn, and you are forced to weigh trading in cards to complete sets versus performing actions on the board before your opponents. By far Wallace's most "Euro" design I've played, and it handles 3 very very well. Recommended.

A bit cold and mechanical - and that's my issue with most every Martin Wallace game.   The theme is barely there, and he forgot to put the fun in the box.   The game peters out on the last few rounds when players have little meaningful actions left to take (and meanwhile they are hoping and praying that the flip of the map tiles doesn't totally swing the biggest kingdoms, and likely it will, and there isn't a thing you can do about it).   Players also require huge quantities of the same card type, so trading is necessary even when it doesn't benefit you.   I did appreciate the Acquire-like roots that are evident, but Acquire is probably a better choice.

2016-04-18 : Straightforward empire game of building ships and cities. A bit of long term planning is possible, but the scoring is brutal - both in points you can gain and other players easily making you lose them - so it can all be for nought. Nobody really wants to trade, so the deck got exhausted every time with people trying to get the right combos. Not earth-shattering but interesting enough that the group decided to give this another try with 4 players in the future.

(3-4 players) A quick little empire building game with a modicum of strategic choices, although most of the time it seems like your hand of cards dictates your choices (card trading can help that).

It *really* needs a good player aid in that regard.

To me, Tyros is somewhat like Settlers of Catan with the annoying parts removed. The card draws still allow for lots of luck to creep in, but it's nowhere near the dice rolls in Settlers.

The first two rounds, I had my doubts.  It felt dry and I wasn't impressed by the plain bits.  However, the tension goes up significantly in the last two rounds when there are many ships sailing around, trying to grab control of territories. 
I am not, however, a fan of any game where trading is necessary.  It's ok given the right type of players, but my friends would never trade to me no matter how far behind I am in the game.

Not the prettiest game, but don't let that dissuade you from playing it.  Pretty groovy balance of card management and empire expansion.

You can trade for better things, but if people aren't into trading, you are completely hosed for that round.

Two plays, one with three and one with four. Basically it's Settlers of Acquire; take Acquire, get rid of the merger rules, stick some boats on the board, and instead of buying shares you use cards to travel from rectangle to rectangle and build cities. Pretty enjoyable, but it doesn't really have a "second idea," as Chris Farrell would say.

A comparingly light hearted M. Wallace Game. Maybe the reason it wasn't published by his own Warfrog but by Kosmos. Card drafting can be frustrating when you don't hit the colors you need. But then you may trade cards with other players or you may exchange them with the cardpile, so there are enough ways to get the resources you need if only your fellow players aren't quicker than you...

From eBay; my first Martin Wallace game!  On a first (solo) play this is an excellent little game with lots of good mechanics. Maneuvering to get to areas of empire with enough resources to take advantage of them before another player denies the option to build seems to be the trick; if you try to bring two ships to guarantee your chances you still allow a window for blocking.  I bet it has lots of great interaction with mutliple players.

Could have been entitled 'Settlers of the Mediterranean' as the building and bartering has a very familiar feel. Problems are in evidence though. The initial 'random' setup breaks down if several empires come out close together. You aim to build in what you perceive will be the largest empire, but that depends on what cards you draw and whether others will trade, and I'm not a fan of 'multiplier' scoring where small changes on the board can make a big difference in points.

Played only a couple of times. Tyros is one of the better examples of a non-Warfrog Martin Wallace effort. The game was clearly designed starting with the theme, but the mechanics have been restricted to the level of a light-to-mid-weight Euro game. The components are poorer than average as is the feeling of the game, but when the player scores are totalled at the end you realise that the scoring mechanism is rather intriguing and wonder how on earth you could have played better. I'm not sure, though, that the trading is a worthwhile addition to the game.

I've played it several times (but not recently) and found it to be enjoyable.  It has the "feel" of a wargame, but no combat.  Players must manage their hand of cards trying to establish the most cities in the biggest empire.  Players have some ability to affect which empires grow.  During the game it is critical to get the cards you need to carry out your plans.  This is where some fault the game - there is a lot of luck in getting the right cards.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play, lots of fun- how can you not like a game about Phoenician ships? Starts slowly, but begins to take shape. I can see how a good game of this would be great and a bad game of it would be miserable, but I am eager to try it again. The negotiation aspect of the game is very thin- we all spent our time refashioning our hands via the bank or working with what was dealt.

Tyros is game that works quite well, but it doesn't offer new tricks. To make any actions at all you need cards -  so pick up the right ones from the stack, will you? If you had a bad luck you can always try to change some cards with your opponents. So if you don't like the game mechanic like this, then you should avoid Tyros. But for the rest of us I say: try it before buy it!

An area influence game where the areas are modular by player selections using grid markers followed by tactical play with set collections to build ships and cities.  It's interesting and I think I would prefer it more if the randomness of getting cards every round were lessen.  Trading cards with others, I think, doesn't balance things out enough.  Perhaps choosing cards using a mechanic like what Alan Moon does in Union Pacific/Ticket to Ride would alleviate this.

Not a brilliant game as some seem to indicate, but neither is it a waste of time.  It played well with 3 players, but be sure you have a good, revised english translation of the rules so your tile placement with 3 players is done correctly.  This helps move the game along faster.

It is a bit long for what the game presents, but I think with a few playings this will get better.

Certainly any Wallace fan would enjoy this.  We thought it was fine, it just didn't have a "wow" factor or bring anything new to our gaming experience.

Elegant.  

Knizia-like but more straightforward.
Can play it with 2 despite what the box says- in fact I think the game plays better with 2 than 4 as you have more actions per player.

Have replaced the colored commerce cards with a draw bag of colored buttons for easier mixing.  Having a discard pile of beads makes it easier for players to judge how many colors opponents have in hand.

It's an interesting game, but I'm not sure that it was fully tested. We had some problems where the game seemed to break down and not work towards the end. We checked to see if we were playing by the wrong rules, but confirmed that we were doing everything correctly. It was a while ago, so I don't remember exactly what happened, but I've heard others have had the same problem. There are too many other better games out there to waste time on one that has end-game problems if certain circumstances occur.

Make areas that you're about to build in bigger (to score more points) and then use your cards as efficiently as you can to move to those areas and build. Repeat for a few rounds and score it up. There's luck in the cards you get, which can at least be allayed with trading and swapping, but they cost tempo. Turns rotate pretty fast. This was decent without being earth shattering, and one I wouldn't mind pulling out every now and then as a pleasant game.

Based on one play: A sort of area control game, where you move your boat in order to build cities within empires. You get more points for being in the largest empires, thus you want to expand the empires where you are present and block the others. Then using cards you build cities and ships and move those ships. You can trade cards but as you can see where everyone is, you can ensure not to help those who may block you. It plays in about 90 minutes and there is little down time. We all enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
Tyros is an excellent and underrated game. It is thematically elegant and exciting to play. It has a nebulous quality: the areas that you are trying to control keep shifting in shape as they grow (Mordred has that also, so maybe its a Wallace thing). Tyros doesn't take too long - an hour and a half, for our learning game.  I'm sure it would be under an hour after you had it down. I love the interplay between cities and ships. There is a lot to think about.  

The fact that it has trading is thematic for a game about phoenicians. I once introduced this game to some experienced settlers players, and they thoroughly cleaned my clock.  It is all in the trading, folks.

I love the board: you have a simple grid, but you also need to follow the jagged coastline of the Mediterranean to move about.

Scoring is oddly complex. At first it bugged me, but I printed out some handy scoring charts that make it easier to settle up at the end.  And the benefit is that it is hard to calculate who is leading.  

I have a homebrew copy. I took a scan of the board and added historic names to the cities (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/370202?size=original). This makes it even more fun.  I took the cards and houses from Tower of Babel for the commerce cards and cities.  Then I bought some wooden Settlers-type ships from boradgamebits.com, and some wood discs to match the Tower of Babel cards for the empires (in brown purple, grey and white).  See the photos I posted.

A fine game that suffers from gamer's fatigue, I think.  It has some nice elements and mechanics to it, and the bits are excellent but simple.  There are lots of tough choices, too, and it comes home in under an hour. Just doesn't get me going, I guess, because there are so many similar games.  Though Joe Gola is close in saying it's "Settlers of Acquire," I think he's a bit off, as your supplies aren't dictated by anything you do at all. I'd call it "Acqui-Attica."  Rating based on one play.

For some reason this game reminds me of a multiplayer Hellas. (I suppose it is the ships.) It's not a bad game but it isn't great. It seems to fall in the same group as the zillions of other nondescript Euro-type games. The author could have easily been Colovini, Kramer, Knizia, etc.

Players are Phoenician traders trying to take commercial control of the Mediterranean.  They go around in a grid board and do their actions with cards.  So, hand management is very important, so as luck of the draw.  It can be recognized Martin Wallace's hand in the turn order, divided by phases and rounds.  The game can be compared with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21882]Blue Moon City[/url][/i], in which players also move around in a grid board and left their markers with cards combinations, and the score is based mainly in a majority system too.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game but not a great one either. It's too long as a medium weight filler but too short to be a heavyweight. Yet I keep thinking about the game. There's alot more to it...

Players essentially manage hands of cards and try to use it to move ships, build ships and build cities for VPs. Majorities in each category (cities & ships) gain the most VPs. Bonuses awarded for being the first to build a city in each empire and to have sole control over an empire.

The trading with the bank allows players to quickly cycle through their cards and 'fish' for what they need; this negates to a big degree, the negotiation aspect of the game.

Neat little game. It offers quite some depth and fun for its box size. Negotiation games are my favorite, because they offer the most direct form of player interaction( you know, you actually get to talk with the other players instead of each one sitting, moving pieces and count score). For me, it is a very good replacement for Catan as an easy 1 hour game for 3-4 players- I prefer it quite a bit. Has some luck in the form of cards but offers couple of options to change one's fate to the better.

Wow, what a great lite empire building game.  Neat way to handle commerce and movement with the same cards.  Lots of tough choices.  It's tough to figure out who is in the lead.  A real gem.  

UPDATE: I recently had a dreadful game of this where everyone played defensively and the game locked up. We couldn't figure out what was so different about that game.  I was hoping we had a rule wrong.    After pouring through the differences between the translation and the origingal rules (and other translations) I found that 1. You must pay a card to your opponent to land in an opponent's city and more importantly 2. There are two rounds of laying map tiles before each card phase.  Please be aware that there are bad rules roaming around.  Don't judge the game too harshly if you use the wrong rules as it turns an wonderful game into a 2 in my book.

4 players only so far.  Lots of fun, fairly fast, and easy rules with deep strategy.  Combination of tactical (working with the cards you draw--luck) and strategic (planning the locations to try and tie up or block) along with planning the expansion of the neutral empires.

Quite simply the best 1 hour 4 player game period.  The balance between trying to expand the empire you *think* you want to expand and then capitalizing on that is unbelievable!

RATING: 6
[Kosmos 02 edition] {Nautical, empire building; trading, area-majority; optimal 4p} Tyros is a thematic empire building and area-majority game. It's a typical Martin Wallace game that players have to make decision with partial information and restrictions.  Tyros is moderately deep and full of player interaction. It's moderately confrontational because players have to block the control of other players. The game typical runs within an hour.

Surprisingly, Tyros is quite strategic, rather than tactical. Players have to plan carefully since the first round. Since the number of rounds is fixed each game, it's easy to plan actions; e.g. when to control a region by city / ships, where to place ships, where to expand, which empire should expand, etc. 

It may occur that players keep trading with the bank until they find the suitable cards. This may reduce the tension of the game but I don't find it a problem because every player has the same chance to find a cards. It just lengths a round a bit and makes shuffling of cards necessary after each round. Besides, trading with player is a much faster way to collect suitable cards. However, I don't find Tyros highly luck dependent.

The ships and the artwork are attractive. The colors are easily distinguishable. The components are language independent and there is a beautiful illustrated English rulebook in BGG.

Tyros felt a little like a simplifed version of Mare Nostrum to me (but, of course, Tyros was published first). It's a fairly light game of territory expansion, which many players will appreciate, especially those with a yen to play a Wallace design in under an hour. For me, though, there was just not enough control in terms of expanding the empires. Having just one legal play (or none) isn't all that uncommon, which really means you have little influence on the overall direction of the game. The trading and card-drawing aspects of the game work well, and there's a decent balance between wanting to improve your hand by discarding and drawing versus taking actions on the board. Still, if someone is dealt a good hand at the start of a turn while another gets all the color cards of the empire that isn't growing, the unlucky player is pretty much hosed. All in all, I can see why this appeals to many people, but it just didn't grab me enough to want to play it again.

A game you'd like to love, but... Somehow, there's something missing to call it a good game.

Very abstract, poor components, a few annoying design flaws... It's like it has not been playtested.

The Pros :

- some smart mechanisms : duality between your ships/towns/colour and the growing "empires", which nobody "owns"

The Cons :

- poor and ugly components : the board is much, much TOO SMALL and very poorly drawn ; some water areas become "overcrowded" at times ; the plastic ship tokens are cute but not very handy : they tend to slip on the board at first blow or hit on the game table ; the tiles ! Why in the heck are the map tiles made of thick cardboard ?? They are not intended to be put on the game board, but rather shuffled, and used as cards ; so why not thin "classical" game card format ??? This would be much more practical.
- VERY poorly written and organised rules : seems like they were written in 1900... Is it too much to expect graphic examples, illustrated step by step ?? Would be much more effective. You have to struggle to understand the basic course of game, whereas it could be much more simply explained ; you end in getting the flow of it after some games, and looking to the forums. Some vital rules are not enough enlighted.
- unlike what could be expected, not a deeply themed game ; it is very abstract per se, and the "Phoenician/trade/Mediterranean" background plays absolutely no role in the game (for instance, it could be also located in a galactic/space background, in a race in space to settle planets and build spaceships, while trading "space" goods, like fuel, spice...). I think it would have been much more effective to enhance this abstract/Euro feel by using a geometric designed map, instead of a representation of the Mediterranean sea area.
- many design flaws, as it seems ; we were permanently wondering if we were playing the rules correctly, because of many "dead end" feelings ; one example : if one player has played all his trade cards, he may have to wait many turns (and so get bored) before the others players are done too ; the discarding/trade off opportunity is a major problem, because in many games all players tend to end up digging in the pile, to get "good" cards...

So, all in all, not a bad game when you grasp the mechanics behind it, but not the great game it could have been.

Martin Wallace classic. Great mechanics put together a nice 1 hour "expansion" game. A gem!

RATING: 7
Top quality game with lots of hard choices pushed upon you, a bit steep learning curve due to the crappily laidout rules and bad rules layout by wallace but worth it , lots of screwage factor and how cute the little ships are !!
A keeper!

Got to try (finally!) at Middlefield with Mark McLaughlin and Kevin Klemme.  We really liked the open negotiations and the simple rules set, it was lots of fun. We used the suggested openning, but would like to try the random openning also.  Nice for such a small box game.

Mediterranean expansion with city building, trading, hand management, blocking, & area control, all from Martin Wallace & Kosmos.  Great way for 3/4P to knock off a tense hour at the game table.  These little boats are rapidly becoming my favourite bits in gaming.

Too many random factors make for an unpredictable and therefore unsatisfying game.

Gameplay was smooth but the playtime was too long compared to the randomness and effect on score that the last rounds had.

Martin Wallace game. Very interesting. I would like to give this another go. It is a neat scoring mechanism and the game play was good. We played with 3 and it was good. I think the rating may go down a bit with further plays but for now something that I would not say no to.

Not a bad game. Unlike others I've found it comes down to the last turn. Its nice that it plays so fast.

Apparently wasn't playing with the correct rules, so I'll withhold a rating until then, but with those rules I am thinking this could be a solid 7. Some very cool ideas here and unusually for Wallace it is quite elegant.

A small box that packs a big punch.  I really like this game but those around me thought it required too much brain work. It did take us over 2 hours. The cost of building a city/moving seems expensive but you get to be able to do more than you think possible once you get playing.

It's not a bad game, but there seems to be something missing in this one.  We played with 3 - does 4 provide more tension?

Players compete to establish cities and build ship fleets in four different empires.  Each player can establish themselves in all 4 empires, and each round the empires grow, but not equally.  At the end of the game cities in the largest empires are worth the most points.  Very good, strategic game.

If you find yourself about to start a game, pray for a flash flood or volcanic rift.  Hopefully god will be listening.

Light enjoyable game with preaty straight-forward rules. A fair amount of luck in needed with tiles and cards. 
Be careful: It's not a trading game at all! (The only trading mechanism, trade with others, is simply not "working" during gameplay)

An interesting new Martin Wallace game, which at first made me think of Acquire, but that was soon banished. Forced expansion of empires that soon butt against each other, where players need to ply their influence among the large and small civs alike. I'd definitely play this again, but with only 3, there was virtually no trading of commodities between players. [UPDATE] Rating dropped from 6.5 to 4.5 after a four player game. Adding another player didn't open up trading any more -- still virtually no incentive to help others, as it's next to impossible to mask your intentions. Also, the horrendous luck of the draw factor can wreak havoc. Get dealt 2 suits so you can plop down cities on your first two actions can net a ton of points just for the luck of it, while another player has to constantly shuffle cards to try and get anything accomplished. Yawn.

Nice components. It's not a horrible game, but gameplay feels a bit clunky here and there. I think this game could have been better with some more development, it feels as if it isn't "finished".

What a neat, neat game!  Simple play that is more than the sum of its parts, Tyros has a pasted on theme but is still captivating to play.

До сих пор хочу в неё сыграть. СМАРТ неправильно перевёл правила, из-за чего она была неиграбельна довольно долго. Потенциально это хоошая смесь еврогейма и вполне себе не абстрактной тематики механики.

Great as a 2 player too if both folks play 2 empires.  Best with the random board setup once you &quot;learn&quot; the default setup.

I think this game mechanics is very awkward. Players need to think logically deep. But, the basement of his logic, the resources are dealt by cards and very random.

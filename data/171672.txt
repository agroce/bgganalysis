Entertaining if slightly chaotic filler.  There is more strategy than it first appears, but I think it's ripe for some alternative card playing variants to add even more to the game.  Now how can I quickly get this back to the table to find out?

This one is actually quite difficult to explain to people. Everyone gets the concept. You need to come second in the race, but there are other factors to consider when actually playing. Still its fairly quick and quite good fun too.

I actually really like the artwork on this one especially the really smug looking player colour cards, and the blind pawn staggering along on the -4 move card.

Az alapötlet nem rossz, hogy mindenben mindig a másodiknak jobb lenni és nem elsőnek, sőt még a táblán lépkedés mechnikája is jónak tűnik. A gond csak annyi, hogy gyakorlatilag semmi ráhatásunk nincs a játékra. Tudom-tudom, hogy ez egy partyjáték, de még azzal a mércével is fájdalmasan befolyásolhatatlan. Random rakott lapokkal pontosan ugyanannyi esélyed van nyerni, mint amúgy. Kár érte, mert lehetett volna jó játék, csak kicsit célirányosan dolgozni kellett volna rajta a kicsivel nagyobb kontroll érdekében.  5.9

racing game with a cute idea (always going for 2nd)

RATING: 5
Components: good quality on cards, ok board and pawns
Complex: you can play as you read the rules
Weight: party - light
Players: 5
Length: 30 mins max
Opinion: ok party game, choose a card, play it on the player you decide and repeat, but for the last card you play. You do this for 5 rounds.
The idea of winning being the second is so lovely... but probably the fun you have on the first rounds is lost at the end when no option for some of the players.

Decent enough filler. Amusing concept but can be incredibly random and uncontrollable. Guaranteed to amuse a group though, especially when everyone slaps cards in front of the same player all at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Crazy game and crazy fun :)

I think there is _some_ control (at least with 3 players).  And I demand _some_ control even in crazy games like this one :)

There's a double twist here: you compete in 5 separate rounds and often you want to be second because only this place scores VPs each round.
But the real twist is that - in order to win the game - you must be second in TOTAL VPs which makes you not to want to be always second in particular rounds (and earn VPs) - you often push specific players into this spot.  Which is not easy of course :)

Some twisted logic and twisted brain behind the whole mechanics, but it's good :)  The game feels fresh even if it's too light and chaotic for some.

EDIT: With 4 players it's on the verge of being uncontrollable, with 5 it IS uncontrollable.  5-player mode is totally pointless.

Neat idea destroyed by too much chaos. The decision you make seems to have very small impact on the game outcome. You are a mere spectator during the match. Some laughable moments though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun little game of trying to come in second place.  You simultaneously play movement cards on yourself or other players. With six players, it's pretty random and chaotic.  I imagine it would be more tactical and fun with 3 or 4 players.

Why First? Is a game where you attempt to come second to score points except you want to come second overall so some times you don't want to score so many points. It's a mildly confusing concept that works better in the tactical variant in my opinion. You will play cards to manipulate different coloured pawns on a scoring track but only second place will score. It works well mostly but sometimes you can feel helpless to change the overall result. Good but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the most interesting chaos games I've played due to the scoring being relative. Simultaneous play both adds to the chaos and entertainment as no one ever felt truely a "wash" for the coveted positions which themselves changed as the game went on. Nothing else like it.

Not sure of the importance of coming second place instead of first other than the novelty. Disliked the simultaneous playing of cards as this was quite chaotic (and a childish mechanic) and risked damaging the cards as players were sometimes reaching across the table so collisions were inevitable but the advanced variant where cards are played in order sounds more interesting. Amusing enough but not sure about replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I love this game. It's rather tricky to have a good strategy to win. Since it depends on what everyone else do, and you do it at the same time, you can't plan but have to hope for luck. But someone will win :-)

Another game purchased solely to complete the ABC challenge but actually pretty good.  Mind scrambling mechanic that only 2nd place scores a round and 2nd place in final tally wins.  Paradigm shifting big time!  Markers are a little fiddly.  Use the alternative rules where cards can be played on anyone.

Interesting race game. You want to be the second highest on the score track to score points. But you want to have the second most points in the game to win. There are 5 rounds so after the rounds are over you want to finish in 2nd. Interesting mind game with players. I quite enjoyed this and will play again if requested.

7.36. After 3 plays. 19/10/2016

Great fun. Played 2x3player and 1x4 players. All games have come very tight to the end with nearly anyone being able to win, although I just realized we have been playing it wrong. We were playing the 5th card as any other card. 

Nevermind, it is chaotic and random but it is good fun. Would like to try it with the tactical variant. 

My only negative comment would be regarding passing cards. It is tricky to make sure everyone does it at the same time and no one changes his mind in the last minute. Additionally it could damage the cards in the long term. We sorted it out using cards from Red7 to allocate the cards by colour. It would have been nice if the publisher would have thought of this and include some solution. Small colour tiles like in Dixit maybe? Nevertheless, good game that plays quickly and will give you some WTF moments.

Played this at the end of a meet up and it was pretty fun (and pretty random).  Another player and I finished the first round with 6 points and we needed to come in second place (and score between 3-6) to come in second in the overall tally.  We both ended up with 3 and shared the win.  We shared a nice fist pump for navigating through the rounds and finishing tied.

Nagyon poénos kis játék, ahol a fordulót a második helyezett nyeri és csak ő kap pontot. Az 5 fortuló után pedig az nyert, aki a pontösszesítésben éppen második lett.

Nyilván elég random a játék, de a szabályba beépített poénért már érdemes volt játszani.

Idea is to be 2nd on score track and second overall. its pretty poor. It feels bloody random and almost has no consequence, planning and is heavy on luck and king-making is just too easy to happen.   It also lasts 2 rounds too long.  The gimmick wares out quickly.    

Not worth your time.

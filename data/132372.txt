The game just doesn't keep you interested long enough. Too few cards for interesting combos and too much chaos for any kind of longer term strategies. However, the game isn't broken at least and might offer some past time activity.

It's a fairly simple game to learn. Greater sets give you greater powers. I suppose it's like a more complex Monopoly Deal. Need more plays to see how it's really worth, but a good game. A bit long, so it's not really a filler though, but doesn't seem long enough to be a main game in a game night.

RATING: 6
Pretty interesting game of building up guild 'sets' of profession types (1 of each 5 colors in a column). The actions you take when playing profession cards get stronger the more you have built up in your sets. And the actions themselves have some interesting variance. You then cash in completely guild sets for points or points + some other effect depending upon what's available in the victory queue (it adds new things as people buy what's available).

I'd probably call this one good (7) if it weren't for the fact that, while interesting, some of the actions that allow you to kill off opponents' sets or trade sets compound the already established luck of being a card game. I think it toes just past the line of my preferred luck tolerance in a game of this type. Otherwise good set of ideas in the game.

RATING: 7
PROS
- Fun little combos that can be done with the cards
- Interaction between cards and players is well done. Definitely not multiplayer solitaire
- Everybody has a chance until the end because of how fast things can score
- Screwage factor which is always fun

CONS
- Iconography can be confusing at first, but after a couple turns you catch on to what they mean
- Downtime is a slight issue. Not too bad, but it's there. Not much to do except just try and think of what you want to do on  your turn
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Only played once, with 5. Horribly slow and I didn't enjoy the experience. But the game seemed like a good one and that it would be great with 3. So I haven't actually had a good experience with it, but that had more to do with the owner ignoring the player count on the box, rather than the game.

Set collection with the complication that the cards you collect all have special powers. The aim is to cash in complete sets for VP cards, some of which also have special powers.  Some of the special powers impact on your opponents, so, certainly with three or four players, your tableau is likely to change significantly between turns.  

The escalation of special powers as a set grows larger was a fresh mechanism to me, but I didn't find it particularly interesting. I did find the decisions the game demands were mostly obvious and the gameplay repetitive.

Card quality in the Pegasus edition is reasonable.  The artwork is functional if not inspired.  The special powers could have used more detailed explanation in the rules.

Nice cardgame with simple rules, fast gameplay and enough interaction. Maybe a bit more than I would have liked. In essence you try to collect sets of character cards, with each character having its own ability that grows stronger the more copies you have of the same character. I liked it.

+ Comprehensible rules that can be taught within 15 minutes

- Possibly better with only 2-3 players. With 4 players Trader is very strong and there is little use for Assassin (since it usually helps the 2 other players more than the player doing the action).
- Luck of cards has significant role

A good card game on first play, somewhat like Dominion and Glory to Rome, with reasonably interesting player interaction possibilities.  

Likely more a 7 of 10 for me, but this game does deserve more attention from BGG gamers, so for now, it's an 8.

Okay, on second play, not that compelling or fun for me, though this game would be enjoyable to anyone who likes card effects games.  I am just not that gamer.  So with some reluctance, this goes down to a 6.

This one is fun all around. Though it is fairly abstract the art is awesome and the game play is so smooth. If there is one drawback it's that in a 2-player game is definitely loses some of its meaner "take that" moments. Which you might view as a good or bad thing depending on how much you like "take that" games. It works well either way for us. However.... this box! AEG! What were you thinking? As soon as the cards come our of the wrap there's no way to store the game unless you have deck boxes or bags. Why no insert?

RATING: 8
Guildhall is a set collection game with lots of interaction between the players. Collect a complete set of 5 different coloured cards in a profession and trade the completed set for victory points cards. Each profession card has a special ability that takes place when you play the card, and the more cards of the same profession you already have the better the ability becomes.

I have only played this game with a full set of 4 players, and I believe that it is as its best with 3 or 4 players and the 2 player game becoming too predictable.

For me this game has taken the place of Dominion as my premiere choice of fun, easy to play and quick card game.

The perfect example of why you shouldn't judge a game by it's box cover. This game looks so bleh! The cover art could hardly make the game look less interesting. Then there are the mono colored cards with all the iconography. Booooring. WRONG. This game is great! It's fast and fun, and if you get the stand along expansion Job Faire, you can mix up the six different guild types for tons of replayability. Great price point, very accessible for new gamers, with infinite room to be expanded.

Wow. I knew I would have liked this game, but did not imagine us tearing through this game and having it climb up my ratings charts the way it has. For me, this is an Innovation killer for when we want a quick bout of something. 

The beauty of this game is that it's streamlined, easy to learn, simple to play, but oh-so-clever in the combos you can pull off. It's also a very tense and nail biting game once you and your partner get further along in learning the ropes. We've demanded many a rematch. It also feels like the games are CLOSE -- when my husband beats me, I'm usually just one turn away from winning.

Guildhall is set in the Tempest world, so I almost skipped it because the first Tempest games were less than impressive. But I luckily changed my mind after having read a couple of reviews.

The game is an almost abstract tableau building card game, with a limited number of different types of cards (just 6!), that plays in a challenging way and is densely packed with struggling decisions. Each player has just two actions per turn, and a surprisingly high number of options, given that each card power has a variable effect that depends on the number of cards of the same type already in play.

Initial tentative rating is a 7, but it could really go up if the game can stand repeated plays (the small number of different cards could limit the replay ability).

A set collection, hand management card game where players gather professional chapters of cards into their guildhall to strengthen your actions and gain VP.  First player to 20VP wins.  Simple to teach, but its depth is revealed over multiple plays.  Important to understand the "Duplicate Dos and Don'ts" from the rule book.

An okay, interactive, "take-that" set collection game.  Lots of poaching of cards from opponents.  Why they only included six characters (the minimum number needed to play the game) is beyond me.  At least basic Dominion gave you some extra cards to mix-and-match so the game wasn't so same-y all the time.  This doesn't feel like a complete game until you mix in the six characters from the expansion (Guildhall: Job Faire).

Neat little set collection card game with special powers. Rules are very simple and easy to learn (though the rulebook could have included more details about card powers, particularly involving timing). The game can be pretty vicious, especially with the Trader and Assassin, but everyone has an equal opportunity to be mean, so you take whatever you mete out. I wish the game were 10 or so minutes shorter, and the random distribution of the VP cards can really give an advantage to the first player completes a set. Have yet to try the expansion.

Interesting card game : you play cards and apply the effect depending on the number of the same type of cards already played.
Complete sets of cards (5 colors) allow to grab VP cards.

Good game but too luck dependent for me.

RATING: 7
A neat little card management game, where players are building a tableau of cards that grants them special abilities in order to advance toward scoring points.

There are several professions in the game you'll be adding to your guilds.  The more of each profession you have (called a chapter), the better the ability that chapter will give you.  Eventually, you will complete that chapter of your guild (by collecting all 5 colors of worker in that chapter), you can cash it in for points.  So, there's a little bit of rummy/set collecting going on, while making best use of the abilities to get you to those full sets.

Overall, a fairly light but fun game that is a cool twist on set collection.

I guess that Guildhall is an okay card game if you play it repeatedly and get a sense for the various card combos and such, but after a single play with 4 it didn’t wow me the way I had hoped it would. It does seem like a fine game in which there are some deadly combos with specific roles. I don’t like that you just attack another person whom you think is leading, so maybe it’s better as a 2p game – I will eventually find out. Also, you can count the cards in the discount pile (although players can camouflage it), especially if you have played a historian and looked through the pile – this means that there is a memory aspect that I don’t fancy at all. 

I tend to think that games in which you can win instantly are cool, and while I do like that you gradually buy points until you reach a number in which a player instantly wins, it does kind of suck that I sat right next to that player who won the game, and he did end up getting an extra turn. I could have closed and won the game on my turn, sigh. Oh well, it’s not a hard game to learn and play, but it just didn’t feel special or particularly interesting.

Still liking this game. I enjoy the set collection aspect of it with the card play. It's difficult to gather a strategy to win when cards are moved so frequently, it's a little chaotic. The game is still fun and comes down to the wire each time usually and can be played with just about anybody. It does need the expansion to add variety, and vice versa. With the expansion I would rate it higher.

Sometimes I simply don't remember why I get an interest in a game. With Guildhall, I believe it was very positive reviews. The theme certainly didn't interest me, the description of set collection didn't either... nothing really stood out except for positive reviews.

...and I'd say the reviews were spot on. This a deceptive game that I very much enjoyed. I'm looking for lunchtime games that I can play with coworkers and sneak in an hour. This game fits the bill perfectly. The set collection is nothing new, but what's nice is that each "guild" gets more powerful as you continue to play cards to it. The interaction between the different guild powers is where the fun resides, but I'd say this game is more approachable than even something like Dominion, as once players learn the guild powers, it becomes familiar and comfortable to play.

Update: Ultimately traded away. It got almost 10 plays with my lunch group, but we found ourselves searching for Smash Up before this one. Happy to play it but don't need to own it.

When I am in the mood for a medium-to-light-weight card game, this is it. Normally set collection can be pretty dull at times, but I like the guild abilities that beef up as you collect more and the player interaction that's not too cruel (often, you don't have many options, so it's hard to fault a player for taking you down a peg). Plays rather snappy, maybe best at three. Rating is with the Job Fair expansion, which really gives it some legs and changes things up for the better. But as a stand-alone, it's still rather good.

I stumbled upon this game very much by accident, asking to fill a 4th seat while I was walking about my game store.  At first I was lost, but near the middle of the game I began to realize just how to play correctly and seeing combos.  I quickly became enthralled and bought a copy that day.  Games are pretty quick and replay value increases with expansion.

Light, fun fare. I like how there is some strategy mixed in with the constant tactical reactions. Many threads to manage in this web as you play with some satisfying chains of events when a plan comes together. I don't care for all of the "take that" maneuvers throughout but it is a non-issue when played solo.

My primary impression of Guildhall is that the game takes too long for what it offers. The game works fine and has a nice and fun amount of player interaction but it is just too long and repetitive after a while. Also I really don't like the dull graphics and I am still puzzled why 52 VP token cards (i.e. more than a quarter of all the cards in the game!) are needed just for the special ability of one of the 6 professions. This seems like a rather disproportionate waste of components for very little use. (This is for the Pegasus Spiele German edition (2013).)

Components: Clear-enough iconography. Good artwork. Easy to distinguish colors. I would prefer borders on the cards to frame them better. Dull theme.

Experience: The Trader and Assassin are nasty pieces of work, as are some of the VP cards. My stuff always felt insecure. I'm not sure there can be any longterm strategy, as the state of play changes so much over the course of a game.

I liked the sure-thing of the Farmer, and using the Weaver to quickly populate my guildhall. But then I couldn't close the deal on my chapters, and they were stolen, traded, or assassinated.

It's fun coming up with the combos of cards to make the most of my turn, but it is also discouraging, given how easy it is to screw me up.

I admire the mechanism by which as I collect my cards in a set, they are able to use their powers more effectively.

Fun little card game with enough interaction between players that it doesn't feel like you're playing solitaire. That level of interaction may be a turn off to some players who don't like the "take that" style of gameplay, however. It is relatively easy to teach and learn, and it has a surprising amount of depth in terms of strategies and tactics.

[i]Disclaimer: Most of my plays have been with two players online at [url=http://www.yucata.de]Yucata[/url], so this rating is for the 2 player game only.[/i]
I do really grok Guildhall's mixture of set collection and combo building. Although the rules are quite simple once you've got a game or two under your belt, there's a lot of room for clever card play. Guildhall is quite interactive in that you always have to have an eye on your opponent's tableau, trying to identify opportunities to enhance your own standing and with experience you'll also discover new tricks to pull of. 

Currently, I rate the base set a little higher than the expansion ([boardgame=142121][/boardgame] ). While the cards in the base game are more straight-forward, the expansion introduces slight memory elements and more complex card abilities so it is a little more taxing to play. Nevertheless, I do enjoy the system as a whole and I'm really looking forward to mix the cards from both sets. 

Great game!

Very good game. Something of a brain-burner; the decision trees often get super complicated. Also there are a couple significant problems with the game art. The card backs make it difficult to estimate how many are in a stack; the two decks have almost identical card backs; the colors are muted and similar; the artwork is consistent but not particularly good.

The game, though, is very good, and I'd like to play more than I get the chance to play.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOn26thMARCH2014][/b] Finally I get to play this! It's really fun! A really great 2-3 player card game. A lot of hand management with set collection and also various kinds of card abilities. It's perfect with three players. With two, it becomes very confrontational where players will keep stealing and killing each other's cards. With four, the AP becomes an issue and make it less fun.

At first, I'm a little worried that the symbols might be too difficult for me to understand but I got everything right even without the help by the person who taught me the game.

* I played the German edition and really gave much applause to Pegasus Spiele for shrinking the box size (about 1/4 of the English edition). I really didn't care for the English/AEG oversize version. Shame on you.

Brilliant game!  This is a take that game right out of the gate.  You want what the other people have and they want what you have.  Cards are flying around the table, constantly changing ownership, until a full set is collected.  You've got to really look at what everyone is doing as there are a lot of fantastic explosive combos that can rain game ending victory points down on the winner.  This is my favorite card game. 

The only thing preventing from breaking this game out all the time and rating it a 10 is the art.  I don't like it, and I don't like looking at it. AEG seems to use a style of art and graphic design for all their games that strongly disagrees with me.

So two years or so after writing this, I'll suck it up and give the game a 10.  Guildhall engages right out of the gate every time I play it.  Games are always a tense scramble for figuring out how to get the right cards at the right time, trying to stay one step ahead of everyone else.  I wish there were more games like it.  It's one of my favorites!

2015-02-10 : High level of randomness combined with the fact the game-state changes so much that you can't properly start to think about your turn until the previous player has finished his turn. 
That's bad, but what's worse is that half a dozen legitimate questions were raised in the first half hour of playing this game, none of which got answered in the rules. Seriously, did anyone except the designer ever read them ?
There's no way anyone outside his little circle ever managed to play this game correctly as there are simply too many rules holes resulting in us having to house-rule way too many times for what's in essence a very simple game.
Removed from my "want in trade" list.

Guildhall is a set collection, tableau based card game.  Premise is simply, try to collect a set of 5 matching professions and use completed sets to buy VP.  The more of a particular profession you have in your tableau, the better the special powers of that profession increase when you play cards of that type as an action.  Once you hit your set of 5, however, they flip to a completed 'chapter' and then you lose access to those better special abilities and have to build from the ground up once again.  There is an Ascension-like display of VP cards.  The VP cards themselves can have one-time special abilities.  The ones that don't are worth higher VP and the ones that do are worth less VP.  The lower the VP value, the more powerful the special ability of the VP card.  Two of the professions and a lot of the VP powers are interactive.  I somewhat felt the game would play better with more than two players as there would be more targets for your interactive abilities.  On the other hand, I think this would introduce a bash-the-leader mentality with the interactive abilities.  To me, there are a lot better card games out there to play.

Fun set-collecting game where you get increasing abilities, and some take-that and can be cut-throat.  Beware of AP with 4 players, coz more opponents & cards to think about.  Easy to explain.

Probably not for me, not enough longevity, existing games are better?

The premise of the game is interesting – play cards to your tableau that activate their power. The more of the same type already in your tableau when you play, the more powerful the power. Where I find it goes askew, however, is that some of the powers mess with other players’ plans. This element, while necessary for balance, is annoying, and the rest of the powers aren’t rich or interesting enough to provide an engaging experience. The depth of the game seems to mostly reside in which player to knock back or steal from. The rest is mildly interesting solitaire set collection.

I played a 2 player game, and I would rather play it with 3 players. The reason is that the assassin' cards are two powerful/frustrating as you have only one player to assassinate. The game is also a little too long for what it is.
That said, I like the mechanisms of building up your tableau for more powerful actions. The dilemma of whether to discard your complete chapters for VP vs. keeping the chapters for more powerful actions, are pretty much non-existing in a 2 player game, since you are too vulnerable to your opponent's Assissing- or Trader card. Therefore, when you finally get a chance for VP, you take it.
I would really like it to be scaled better. I have the feeling that the Trader cards will take too long to resolve in a 4 player game, since you must consider all players' tableaus. Therefore, I think it's only good with 3 players.
My suggestion: Trash all Assassing cards before you play (at least in a 2 player game). You don't really need them.

L5R themed version that came with a tiny little rules leaflet so it is possible we missed a few of the key rules but over all really nice little set collection game.

The 9 different abilities for each faction are intuitive once you work out the symbolism (i.e white symbols are yours black symbols refer to opponents) and then the game begins to flow. It can suffer from lucky/unlucky card draws but overall I thin there is a good amount of strategy in this little card game. i think with more than 2 players this would become quite random and a bit chaotic however thee is a nice amount of control in here with just 2 players.

20 victories points seems a little high as the game outstays its welcome sightly... or maybe we were just so cutthroat with each other we made the game drag on a little, either way I would happily play this again.

Guildhall is a fairly typical direct conflict set collection card game. I suspect people who like Citadels or Ruse & Bruise will feel right at home here. The game it reminds me most of, however, is Carnival, with the primary difference being that Guildhall seems to have had some proper development. I don't expect to ever become a fan of this type of game but at least here the card interactions are quite interesting and you always have something to do on your turn.

By itself, I would rate this game lower because it seems someone always ends up spending most the game getting lots of duplicates they can't play. Sure they can discard and draw new cards, but when that's what you do with most of your turns, that doesn't seem very fun.

But if mixed together with Job Faire, players almost always have interesting options to choose from, and the game is a lot more fun. However, that does tend to make it run a bit long.

The Job Faire expansion adds seemingly more complex mechanism, and am less a fan of that version, but can see it may be useful to seed the base game with one or two card types.  Not bad at all (Rating 7.144, May 2015) UPDATE: I do like this game, yet to play 3 player, but I think that would probably be the best arrangement.  Four player can have a bit of downtime,yet as a closer for the evening, that might be good, as you can rest and not have to be constantly thinking.  A good game and a keeper (rating 7.637, Dec 2015) UPDATE: Three is definitely the best for this game.  Two is a bit take that, and 4 is too much down time, but I would still play it (June 16).

Pretty confrontational game, lot's of killing/stealing their guys. Not a spouse friendly game.

Game is set collecting, as your set grows bigger the more power you have, when it's complete it goes away and turns into a chit to buy victory point cards that also have usually a special power.

RATING: 7.8
Wow!
Incredibly good game!
The concept of ,,the more cards - the more power" is marvelously fun and engaging.
Now I was thinking about new polish edition of Guildhall Fantasy to buy, but...

BUT! But Watching the graphics in the new - fantasy - edition I can only ask myself - what's wrong with this world? Why is generic (ugly as hell!) fantasy more interesting to anybody than middle ages?

Meh. After several more plays - both online and in real life - the game drags a bit sometimes. And - what is worse - it can be really random sometimes and it really, really makes you angry.
Nevertheless - very interesting title. :)

Very good set collection game where sets additionally provide escalating abilities with which to manipulate your own, and your opponents' sets in play. Player interaction (and bashing) is rampant.

Rules are simple and mostly clear, the bits are average but functional. The box is rubbish - very big with an even bigger insert that does not hold sleeved cards - really!?!

RATING: 8.5
An awesome card game, where players try to collect sets of cards in accordance to get points. The different profession cards allow for different actions that will influence future actions and other players sets of cards. 

Very strategical and fun game! It will should take over 30 minutes to play, not common with card only games but that's not a problem at all since time will fly by as you're having fun screwing your opponents.

My whole family loves this game.  My husband is very good at keeping to himself while quietly building up his victory points.  I like taking the 'actions' with the different professions of the cards and building chapters to 'pay' for victory point cards. It seems to keep everyone's interest and attention as they are not only keeping track of what they are doing but also are watching everybody else to see where they can gain an advantage.

was almost exactly what I was expecting.  It was a Saturday all day gaming thing and we were hemming and hawing on what to play while waiting for others and someone wanted to play their new game (they had already played it once with their family).  I looked at Neil and said 'Are we going to sit down and play an AEG game?'  We shrugged and sat down anyway.  It was fairly boring, repetitive and near the middle as people kept taking from each other it seemed like it was going to just drag (and it did a bit).

Rummy-like game wherein you race to collect sets, then turn them in for points. Each card suit has its own special rules, which take some explaining. The game has a lot of "take that" going on, and success depends upon other players not screwing you over. In all, it's ok.

Nothing new here, and there are some rough edges that should have been developed better.

But there just doesnt appear to be any long-term replayability with the very limited # of card powers limiting synergy discovery.

While I thought it was a decent game with 2 players, I couldn't imagine the downtime while someone figures out what they can do on their turn with more players.  Stuff can change pretty large in a single turn, and you can't plan too much for the future.

Nice to see a card game not go the route of deckbuilding stuff. Theme is pretty meaningless.

Relatively simple card-based game.

The assassins are kind of mean and does make it possible for everyone to "gang up" on a player and make their game miserable, but I can understand the balance that assassins bring. Thankfully I don't play with people who game by ganging up, so no problems there.

A nice interactive card game that's quick to teach. I've preferred it with two than with three, and have yet to try with four (although I've no real interest in doing so).

This game seems like a good game. I want to like it.
But
Every game I've played (with experienced players) I have won because I just abused the farmer's VP...farming... ability, and won. Note, on both occasions I was more invested in the games going on around me than I was in GH, and yet I still won. Even when my opponents were pulling amazing combos off and chaining abilities. Even when they ganged up on me and I got screwed early on. Seems like something is a little broken...

Really couldn't quite understand this game, very random and directionless.

Set collecting game where you try to get groups of 'workers' in your play area to exchange for VPs, problem is that all the other players are able to steal or trade your cards depending on what they play from their hand (which you can't possibly know as you all draw blind from the deck) so it's almost impossible to have a real strategy, it would perhaps work better if you could see the other players' hands or if the cards were drafted from the table, or something.

Would recommend getting something like Dominion instead -  I don't think any amount of expansions will make this great.

At its core, Guildhall has some enjoyable mechanics. It's fun to piece together ways of having the cards interact with each other to maximize one's turn. It's quite satisfying when two cards plays result in numerous points or more than twice as many cards actually going in one's tableau.

I only have two major issues with the game. The first is that luck of the card draw can influence the game substantially. The other is that the player interaction can sometimes be too vindictive, ruining one's plans or chances of winning because of being in the wrong situation at the wrong time (or because of the whims of another player).

I would probably enjoy this game a bit more if it were a shorter, filler game, but as is, it's still fun to play occasionally.

Two plays only, but feels like a fun, tight and highly interactive card game with a simple rule set.

I particularly like the back-and-forth scrambling between the players driven by the card powers, and the build-up-and-switch nature of the guilds in which the chapters in your guildhall build up strength until you cash them in for points (which you must do to win) and have to start again from scratch.

Chaotic fun that works from 2-4 although there's understandably less chaos at the lower player counts. Can be very "take that" but sometimes players who prefer to play less aggressive can choose not to take the assassin actions. We've had very close finishes as well as surprising combos of profession cards and VP cards with actions that seem to come out of the blue. Yet to try with some profession cards mixed with Job Faire cards.

An underrated game. A great medium-weight set collection game. It's easy to teach, has a nice amount of interaction, and plays well with all player counts. Everyone I've taught this too has liked it, and most have picked up a copy for their collection. 

This is one of the most under-rated games in my collection. The most under-rated and under-appreciated are probably Five Points and Cavum. But those games will have relatively narrow appeal, especially Cavum. Guildhall should appeal to a wide range of players. I've had especially good success teaching it to people who like Dominion, even though it's a set collection game and not a deck builder.

Main problem of Guildhall is that is designed  to move slowly (you often draw a lot of cards at the start of your own turn + the situation can drastically change between turns = you have to do most of the thinking during your own turn). Other than that it's a fine game with a tension filled ending. Rating could go up with further plays.

After reading the rules I thought that Guildhall is going to be good, but unfortunately it's full of big swings (I can live with that) BUT what kills the game is all the waiting time: yes, you can think your next moves before your turn, but the player just before you can mix your ideas and ruin your plans, so you have to start over again... and that sucks. I guess this works best with two, but instead of this I would choose Babel. Oh, and have to give big minus because of such a bad cards quality!

In Guildhall, each profession grants you special abilities, and these abilities grow stronger the more of the set that you complete. When you cash in the set for victory points, however, you lose the ability until you can build it up again. Which professions are worth risking VP to keep?

Gioco bastardissimo in cui bisogna costituire l'equipaggio di una nave in combriccole da mandare a completare svariate missioni.
Ogni personaggio ha un abilità che diventa tanto piu potente quanti personaggi dello stesso tipo sono gia presenti sulla barca.
Divertente.
Preferisco giocarlo in 2 che in 4 per motivi tempistici.

I shouldn’t really add this because we didn’t finish the game (another player showed up and we weren’t close to the end, so we bagged it). However, I think I played enough to get a view of it. Shame on AEG with this one. This is a really nice, fun, confrontational, strategic game that they saddled with a same-old-crap title, artwork, and theme. Going solely by the name and cover, I thought this was the usual Euro junk, and who could blame me? But it’s not, it’s a card game that is light on its feet and full of intrigue and action. Don’t do like I did and overlook it.

Has some good mechanics but is extremely long for what it is. The box says 30 mins but it ends up taking 2+ hours.  AP-prone people can cause this game to drag big time.  The biggest issue is you can't plan ahead because your play area and other's play areas are constantly changing.

RATING: 5
Guildhall is an OK game, but not one I can really express much enthusiasm for. You have 6 or so different card types which each have their own ability, and you need to combine those abilities efficiently in order to win. There's not much to it, and I don't imagine there'd be a lot of repeat play even if the first game was really exciting (which it wasn't).

It's certainly a balanced and functional game, and it doesn't outstay its welcome, so it works well as a filler-type game, but it's not really anything more than that.

Really enjoyed my one play.  About the same depth as Dominion, and similar in that it's just cards, with different people that do different things for you.  You get actions on your turn, and you can get more actions... but really that's where it ends.  It's different enough to stand on it's own for sure.  It's fun that the cards become more powerful as you collect more.  There is a pretty heavy dosage of "take that" so you have to be ok with that, but it's pretty fun.  I really don't believe I'd ever buy this without the expansion... same 6 cards every single game?  It's one of those that really should have been released more completely than it was initially.  Hate it when they do that to just make more money.  But yeah, pretty fun little card game.

UPDATE: second game was super slow and I just didn't get the chance to get anything going.  People kept taking cards out of my guilds, so I would work towards something that ultimately didn't matter.  Got 4 whole points during the course of the game.  I'll try it again, but that game didn't go well.

RATING: 6
It's definitely a cool game, and I'm a sucker for set collection. However, the end game kills this one. It's one of those games where you're like "hey, it's the last turn, I better do something great to win." And it slowly becomes, turn after turn, "why can't I find the right combination of cards to simply end this game." The fact is, the only way to win (if the players are aware of basic defense strategy) is to get a lucky draw. I HATE that. I'm not a huge fan of racing games in general, and I particularly hate games that stall out like this one can. Not a bad game, but the end game is a deal-breaker for sure.

FUN: everytime I play this, I'm amazed at how how well works and how close the games always are.

UNIQUE: I'd be hardpressed to think of any other game that combines set-collecting, take that powers and a Dominion like versatity as well as this game does.

NEGATIVES: some games with 4 players might result in a tug of war that can take a little too long.

I think I'd hate the game one way or the other, but I confess part of the rating includes the extraordinary high hopes I had for it. Mike Fitzgerald counts it among his favorites and everything seemed like I'd love it.

Maybe it was me. Maybe it was the folks j played with, but it just was zero fun and went on WAY longer than I expected.

Reminded me of Fools fortune, with the set collection and card swapping (of opponents' sets), but without the advanced strategy options.  Good but not great.  While FF and this are both pretty light on theme, FF at least has some great artwork, flavour text etc, rather than being duplicate images.  

Happily Guildhall is colour-blind friendly due to the iconography (although this can be hard to see across a table, when trying to figure out what cards an opponent has tabled).

Collect sets with cards that give you super powers. The larger your sets the better your powers are. When you get 5 of set you can turn them in for VPs (which also have super powers). It works and the combos were intriguing it but felt sorta ridiculous at the same time. Many of the powers are in hand or table manipulation. The play is very tactical as plans get destroyed and cards are stolen from you.

Intriguing set collection game with some take that mechanisms. It can be very nasty at times but you shouldn't take it too personally. My wife really likes this one. Works well with 2, even more interaction with 3 but a bit on the long side then. 4 might be too long for what it is.

Guildhall is a good tactical card game - a peer of Smash Up.  It is easy to teach and finishes in 30 minutes at 2 players. With more than 2 players, the amount of chaos and downtime between turns can become a real annoyance.  The game is random and tactical - players need to respond well to the changing board state and the changing cards in their hands.  The artwork and theme of the game makes people feel like it should be a serious strategy game, but it is not.  If it had a lighter theme, it would probably be more agreeable to people.

This is a tableau based card game with a LOT of interaction. You are trying to build up sets of the same value cards but in different suits. Each card played has an action, most of which impact other players, so the game has to be played with the right group. We spent a lot of actions just “attacking” each other so the game went on for too long before someone managed to achieve the required number of victory points.!

I really liked this game for awhile, but as time has gone on, it's started to feel very slow and prodding to me. I like the rummy aspect, but other games do this better, and in less chaotic and restrictive ways (Wyatt Earp, for instance). Maybe if I sought out other sets for different abilities I'd like this better. As it is, this game has gone down, in my estimation, and is now merely okay.

A strong game at making you feel clever with its card combinations. But actually it's out of control on so many levels that trying to plan anything ahead your turn results in massive amounts of frustration, because the board state always swings in unexpected ways, generally by having your stuff blown up, swapped or stolen, turn after turn after turn after turn. In this regard, it's an overcomplicated "take that" game.

I owned the AEG Black Friday Black Box version of Guildhall and, strangely enough, the much cooler sounding 7th Seas variant included actually makes less thematic sense than the original's Middle Ages theme. The idea of tradesmen banding together to form guilds for solidarity and profit makes more sense than crewing a ship with nothing but one type of pirate, like say Musicians. If my opinion of Guildhall improves, and the rest of the games in the Black Box turn out to be busts like Trains, I may just sell off the Box and buy Guildhall as a standalone.

This is one I'm going to put in the same category as Smash Up. I was expecting a shorter game. It took about an hour to 75 minutes to play. I think I'll like it a lot more as I continue to play it, just like I did Smash Up, but I need to get over the play time expectations.

While the mechanics are interesting, and the action chaining can make for an engaging puzzle, the game basically came down to being neck and neck the whole way through and then flipping a coin at the end. It's unsatisfying for a strategic card game with plenty of direct interaction to come down to luck -- did I go first, did an opponent cause me to discard the one card out of 10 that I needed him to discard, did I happen to draw the right cards... all of which were true on a first play, leading to a thoroughly undeserved win (the best kind... that does not make for a high game rating, however).

It's a 99% abstract game, with very simple rules and few different cards, but with a good deal of tactical possibilities and card combos that will allow you to turn the game upside down in a couple of turns. But the good news is that you can't do that simply by drawing the right cards, you must develop a viable strategy, work it and then yes, be lucky enough that the rest of the players don't mess it up.

Beacuse the game is not as lucky as random. there's plenty of interaction and it's quite normal that someone will do something to you between your turns. It can be minor, but also major, although this is not as frequent. 

It packs a lot of good thing in a short playing time.

Comparisons to Palastgeflüster and Babel summarize the general feeling quite well. There are only six different cards, with a strong restriction on which cards can be played on a turn, and the played cards are used for moving melded cards wildly around in order to score.

Works very well with two players, and nicely with three, but probably is too slow with four.

The US edition comes in a ridiculous box size and hideous cover, while the German edition comes in sensible size but with a ridiculous cover. The box size and low price make the German edition worth a try.

Gioco di carte molto carino e con fortissima interazione. L'obiettivo di fare punti vittoria si raggiunge attraverso la formazione di ciurme all'interno della propria imbarcazione. Ogni personaggio però ha anche degli specifici poteri speciali che rendono opportuno invitarli a bordo. Giochino senza grosse pretese ma che si lascia giocare volentieri. In alcune partite la durata tende a crescere probabilmente troppo.

Delightfully efficient hand-management and simple card-driven actions. Very tasty artwork, too (love that dancer!), but the game-end is far too abrupt and marginal, and the initial deck requires very thorough shuffling to be balanced. Fun, though, which counts for a lot.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]While this game has cooled somewhat with my kids, it has become a favorite of my wife and I especially when we go to a cafe. This game has stayed fresh after 25+ plays and I still don't feel like it's been played out which is quite amazing when you think about the fact that you are playing with the same 6 (to 12 if you include the expansion) characters. What is cool is that we are still discovering new ways to set up combos between different characters. We are much more aware of what the other player is setting up and have become much better at doing our best to mess with each other's plans. 

I will mention that I think 2 players is the sweet spot for this game, we have found that the game tends to drag with more (especially 4, I won't play at that count again). This is another game I would highly recommend, especially since AEG doesn't plan to reprint it and it is going to get harder to find.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays great with 2.
- Another great cafe game, as long as you put it into a smaller box.
- An interesting take on set collection, each card type has special abilities dependent upon how many have already been played in your guild hall.
- There is a surprising amount of depth (I feel like I am still scratching at the surface) for a game that only has 6/12 different card types.
- Quick playtime, about a 1/2 hour for a 2p game.[/i]

It's got that Palast Gefluster feel, faster and more forgiving, which ain't a bad thing. There are 6 types of cards, each with a special ability, and each turn you're trying to work out which two of your cards you want to play to get the most out of their abilities, the aim being to collect sets of a type (being 5 cards in the same type, each a different colour). The cool thing is that the more cards you already have in a set, the more powerful its ability becomes, until the set becomes complete and then you lose its ability altogether. But the completed sets do earn you VPs. So its a game of swings and re-sets. The abilities are pretty hitty so don't expect your tableau to be as you left it when next you start your turn. Apart from working out which abilities you want to play on a turn, the other big call is when to spend an action to ditch your hand and hope to draw the cards you really want, a surprisingly frequent decision. If you don't mind the chaos of the card movements and the card draws, this is a neat 45 minute tableau game that's got play in it ... but I'm not sure how much replay given it only has the 6 abilities.

[b]I could play this all day.[/b] Another outstanding card game from AEG. Hand manage your cards to collect sets, use abilities, and trade sets for VPs. Appeals to all ages and gamer types. Great with 2 players, IMO. Slightly better with more players. Plays about 10-15 minutes per person.

Reminds me of a mix of Carnival with Plato 3000.

The card playing and set making mechanics are not new ones however it is very well implemented in this game. You have a hand of cards that you play and each card gives you a different action. You goal it to use those actions to get points however only one card actually gives you points directly, thus you make sets of the same cards but with different colors and use those to collect point cards. You can never play the same card once you have one down, so you must use the actions wisely to complete your sets.

Guildhall is a clever card game in which you're trying to collect sets of occupation cards.  You play an occupation in front of you, and then perform its ability.  However, if you already have cards of that occupation in front of you, its ability may be enhanced.  You can't play an occupation of the same type and color that you already have down, and once you get all five colors of a particular occupation, you can turn it in for points and start over again.  The abilities themselves are fairly interactive, so you always want to be on the lookout for how you can take advantage of someone else's tableau, or stop them from doing the same to you.  I thought this game was pretty engaging and fun.

Super-filler, teaches and plays quick but with a nice amount of depth. Citadels-esque, action/role selection (some take-that elements, manipulating other's tableau) with Elysium-esque set collection (active powers are sunsetted when you cash in for points). Twilighting sets usually has a nice catch-up functionality.

This feels a lot like a basic card game like Rummy with some extra powers added in for the different suits. You are trying to collect sets of matching cards to turn them in for victory points.

This game is like building tiny, self-destructing engines with a concise action point setup. Imagine if you took Deus and trimmed it down to just the five different types of buildings, and then turned the completed engines into offerings to the gods. I really liked it, but need more plays to better wrap my head around how much I like it.

I really like the pirate retheme and its art, but considering it was only a special reissue of the Italian version in the AEG Black Box, it's unlikely I'll get my hands on it.

One of my all time favorite games. I love nearly everything about this game. Hand management, putting together combos that let you complete a set (or even two) that no one was expecting you to get, and building everything right out in the open so your opponents can clearly see what you're going for and are forced to decide if it's better to make the play that will build up their own sets or attack one of yours.

Card game of building guilds (1 character in the 5 different colours) & then converting for victory points.

This is a great, simple, game.  The only "learning curve" is figuring out the symbols on the cards, but once you have them down, this plays quickly and is very enjoyable.  It plays well at two players as well as larger games. 

The box is huge and honestly this could just fit into a small card box, which is a bit aggravating (and of course the rules are huge).  

This would easy to teach to non-gamers.  (JW)

Ok set-collection game - plays fast with no set-up time.  But there's just not a lot going on strategically to make me want to come back.  It seemed like going first determined who won - in both of our games, the player that went first won (we switched), and the other player was about to hit 20 on their next turn.  Haven't tried with more than 2 players, but it seems that it would be too chaotic with more, like Innovation is.  Mechanically quite different, but Fairy Tale give me the same kind of feel set-up and play wise and is my strong preference.

It is hard to plan too fully since the game state can change wildly between turns.  Maybe 3p is the sweet spot.

I understand the concept of store shelf presence, but I'm not buying this game due to the oversized box for the contents. I only have so much space and will instead add a small sized game to squeeze into my shelves over this. A pity because I think I'd like the game.

Purchased the small German box size version. Just reinforces the absurdity of the English version's box size.

Enjoyable card game with some nice moves for players to make, some decision making, fast turns, playing in under an hour. Reminds me of Lords of Scotland. There's some nice blocking at the end to keep the competition close, but players have a nice amount of control and multiple VP choices.

Rated after 1 play, interesting game, but one of the players (the player who went first) "just won" basically in a single turn by comboing some VP abilities which had him shoot from 4 points (20 is the goal) to 13 and enough face down stacks to make a win on his next turn inevitable. If this is an anomaly I think I will like this game a lot, if it's common place it offers too varied a play experience across the same game. Cautiously wanting to play more, but could just be trash.

RATING: 7
Played one 2P game. Guildhall is about collecting sets of professions, and converting them into VP whenever you collect a set of 5. The usual way to add a card to a set is to play it down during your turn, which will also trigger an ability associated with that profession. As a result, there is a fair amount of player interaction going on as Assassins can eliminate your opponents' cards, while Traders swap opponents' cards for yours. 

Guildhall is mostly tactical as it relies on working with the cards you draw. There are plenty of decision points in the game, which include choosing which cards to play, when to discard cards from hand, and even which VP card to claim for completing a guild. However, the state of the game can change drastically in a single turn, so there is some downtime involved as you will be frequently reevaluating your actions during your own turn.

Set collection where each card represents a character, each with their own distinct abilities/actions...this simple mechanic adds a generous amount of strategy. Easy to teach and learn, but it takes a few games to understand the intricacies of efficient card play.

Könnyed, gyors kártyajáték. 5 különböző színű 6 fajta képességű emberből építjük saját céhünket. Ha megvan egy emberből az 5 szín, akkor beválthatjuk őket győzelmi pontra. Minden körben két embert játszhatunk ki, akik képessége attól függően egyre erősebb minél több van belőlük a céhünkben. Elég sok interakció van a játékban egymás lapjai tekintetében, ezért úgy érzem bár 2-4-es játék, 2-en lehet a legjobb, mert több játékos esetén könnyű a királycsinálás. Kellemes játék a Guildhall.

Ketten viszont sok lap képessége nem jön ki. 4-en játszva pedig egyértelműen az nyer, akinél a legkevesebbet rombolják a többiek. Szerintem nem lehet benne annyira jól játszani, hogy a körülményektől függetlenül tudjunk nyerni, de annyira rosszul se, hogy ha hagynak játszani, akkor ne mi nyerjünk. Szóval nekem valahol túl nagy benne az interakció és nem föltétlenül a tudás dönt. Egyet rontok is a ponton.

This sounds very interesting ... I love the fact that the stacks of cards have a tangible benefit which you also lose when you complete a set and cash them in.  I can imagine it would make for some antagonizing decisions ...

RATING: 2.5
Chaotic play prevents planning even one turn ahead, while complex interactions and combos ensure plenty to think about (and thus slow things down) every single turn. It's a step up from Bang or Munchkin, but not a huge step, and lacks the fun theme of those games.

I like the variation in abilities you can invoke in the game and the reward tiles you can win.  I wish there was a little more depth in the game.  I also don't really care for it thematically.  I prefer to play this game with intent to build my own engine, and don't care to look at how to slow down my opponents, which probably affects my potential and interest in the game.  It's still a really fun game.

Not great, but not bad, either. You've got a set collection and as you're building your sets, you get more and more powerful actions until you finally cash them in for victory points.

A fun, quick-playing set-collection game with multi-use cards like in San Juan, Race, etc., but a bit more limited. Here, there are 6 types of cards that are collected in sets and used to activate abilities. Abilities vary by type of card, and by the size of the set collected thus far (bigger set = better ability). Sets are then used to buy VP cards, which may have their own abilities. The first player to get to 20 VP wins!

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
[b]Setup[/b]
- 6 types of [u]Profession cards[/u], each with 4 cards/color x 5 colors
… These show card abilities (e.g., earn VP chits or cards, discard other players' cards, add/swap cards) with strengths based on the number of cards already in your "chapter" (set). 
… Deal 9/player
… Random start player, then clockwise: discard any of your cards, in any order, to Discard Pile; then draw back up to 9 cards in hand. Finally, place 3 different cards, grouped by profession (each group/set = "Chapter") so that all cards are visible, face up in display (= your "Guildhall"). 
- 30 [u]VP cards[/u]
… Each shows a VP value, cost (in completed Chapters), and card ability
… For 2-3 player games, remove 2 5-VP cards and 1 or each other VP card from the game
… Deal 5 face up in Center Row

[b]Your Turn[/b]
[u]Take 2 Actions[/u]. For each action, choose one of the following (may choose the same one twice):

- [u]Discard Card(s)[/u]
… Place any number of your cards, in any order, on top of Discard Pile
… Draw back up (if necessary) to 6 cards in hand
… Note: Any time the draw deck is empty and someone needs to draw, shuffle discard pile to make a new deck

- [u]Play 1 Card[/u]
… Max 1 card / profession / turn
… Play a card from your hand into your Action Area and use its ability
… Card abilities are based on the number of cards of that profession already in a Chapter (set) of your Guildhall (display). You may use any single power on the card numbered less than or equal to the total number of cards in the Chapter
… No duplicate cards ever allowed in any Guildhall
… A Chapter is "completed" when it includes all 5 colors; immediately turn it over into a face down stack. Max 3 completed Chapters at any time (if you get more, discard Chapters until you're down to 3).

- [u]Buy 1 VP Card[/u]
… Discard completed Chapters to buy one VP card (cost is on VP card)
… Place VP card face up in your action area
… If you want, immediately activate the VP card's abilities
… Place the top card of the VP deck into the Center Row

[u]End of Your Turn[/u]
- Move all cards from your Action Area into your Guildhall (no duplicates allowed -- discard those cards instead)
- If your VP total is 20+, you win!

This is a good filler game with a decent amount of interesting decisions to be made.

In the game there is a large deck of cards with 6 professions in 5 different colors in it.  Players will play these cards on their turn and produce an effect listed on the card.  The power of that effect increases depending on the number of those profession cards already in your "guild hall".  At the end of your turn the cards you played will become part of your guild hall.

Once you have a set of professions in all 5 colors in your guild hall (playing cards of the same profession and color you already have in your hall is disallowed) you can turn that in to purchase a victory point card.  These cards have varying values and special effects on them (and a couple even require turning in two guilds to purchase).  Once a player reaches 20 points this way they win.

This game has a lot of player interaction, which I love.  The profession abilities include things like forcing opponents to trade professions with you or outright discard them from their guild hall.  There are a lot of interesting decisions to be made like whether or not it is safe to play a certain card or will your opponent steal it from you to complete his set, should you risk not turning in a completed set for a lower value victory point card to save up for a more valuable one next turn, and much more.

It also plays pretty quickly and isn't a very difficult game to teach to new players.

Fave 2 player game and whilst it's still good with 3 it does slow down a greater degree at 4. Love that card combinations as well as the race for the VP card's card in the middle which are random and some giving you a special action.
Have played a couple more times as 3 and 4 and is a bit too slow as a 4 but fine as a 3. Always welcome by everyone when broken out.

After watching some reviews, this seems another cardgame with some interesting mechanics, where the theme really could've been anything.

Might be 'ok' to play a few times, when you still get the hang of each character but after you've got their basic function down it's typically a game that hangs on expansions. Now, coming from AEG, that is to be expected: you buy a lot of air and hope that you'll stay interested in the game just long enough to buy some of them and in the end you have spend so much that you could've bought any full boardgame.

Now, comparing this to other cardgames such as MTG (building up your own dominion and really anything can happen, but it costs you a leg), Android Netrunner (with very interesting asymetric setup that works), Innovation (the best tactical cardgame) or Mage Wars (with great spatial tactics supported by the cards) I really, really don't see anything here that would justify a buy from me. 

Boring without expansions is just a no-go. And that goes for the whole range of Guildhall.

initial rating after one play (2 players). First impression is good. I like how the rules are very simple and the game offers some luck (in the card draw) and some strategy (in playing your cards right). And the interaction makes this a snappy game: you always have to be careful you can complete a guild before an opponent steals or kills some of your cards.
Update: plays great with 4 as well. I found myself hoping everytime an opponent played a Murderer or a Trader "please don't pick me, don't pick me" and cursing when they did pick my guildhall to kill or steal my cards. Good times!

EDIT: Discovered a major rules error made by my group. I'm fairly sure my comments below will change, as will my provisional rating of 3.

At first, I liked the game. Then I hated it. Then I gained some familiarity with all the rules, and it was okay -- but just barely. What a whirlwind!

Guildhall is a "take that" set collection game. This wouldn't be so bad if the play-time was shorter and/or you could build some card combinations on your turn to make up for the fact that planning between turns is largely futile. Overall, I felt the game was repetitive and lacking in any longterm strategic options -- and yet it took too long to be an entertaining filler. Perhaps I'm missing something. I'll try it again, but I'm deeply suspicious.

Developing a successful guildhall by playing cards with increasingly powerful effects based on how many cards you have, but scoring points by sacrificing those groups of cards and sort of starting from scratch.

Every turn is a puzzle, trying to figure out how to use your cards to manipulate the board and gather the necessary number of cards to buy points. But the puzzle is fun and interactive.

Using the expansion, this setup seems to make for the best experience: the Weaver, Farmer, Robber, Hunter, Dancer, and Scholar. The Assassin just slows the game down so I never use it.

The base game is just okay, but with a good mix of characters from the expansion this game is really good. My only concern is the start player advantage and I wonder if playing an equal number of turns would benefit the game, instead of ending as soon as someone hits 20 points.

First Impression:
An interesting and well designed set collection card game.

The game is fluid and plays well, and creates some interesting decisions as a card game. It fits into the same category as 7 wonders and augustus, as it is a quick yet witty and replayable card game. The diverse score cards (plenty of which give a plethora of actions to do other than just score) is a particularly nice touch.

On the downside, the theme is not as clear as I would like, and the artwork is not good enough for me. 

Overall I find this game enjoyable, but doesn't dethrone the king of quick strategic card games: 7 Wonders.

Guildhall is a nasty little take-that card game that I'd been itching to try for sometime... mostly because I saw it being played and it looked interesting.  That was before I saw the box, which decidedly does not look interesting.  

I really don't understand the marketing strategy that they went with.  The box cover is one of the most bland and boring things I've ever seen.  While it does have some of the characters from the cards on the box cover, it does nothing to suggest the gameplay.  And they picked the least interesting character to put front and center.  The farmer?  Really?  Not the assassin?  Come on! I think they would have been better off just using a photograph of a group playing the game than this clunker.  

I think someone said "You know, Eurogamers will buy anything if you make the cover bland enough.  And hey, people like Agricola, let's emphasize farming... that'll work."  The first draft of the cover must have been too bland though and someone said "Spice it up.  Throw some pigs in there!"  

And why is this thing called Guildhall?  The only more bland and boring name I can think of is if they just called it Tableau which actually sounds better.  Honestly, I'm not sure that they got a heck of a lot out of themeing this game.  I think if you took out all the artwork and just had six suits, this game wouldn't suffer at all.  

But enough about the horrible theme and name; the game itself is pretty good.  The cards do interesting things, and there's a lot of opportunity to mess with other players.  I like the idea of having the expansion and mixing up which cards are in play.  That adds a lot of strategy in terms of how all the cards will interact.  And the random distribution of the scoring cards with special powers shapes the game as well.  I enjoyed this quite a bit.

RATING: 6
[thing=132372][/thing] is a card game about set collection and using several abilities of the different type of cards in order to achieve the required 5 cards of different colors to form a set in order to trade it for points.

Basically, in a turn, the player will do two actions: play a card - activating or not the ability of the type it its -, trade sets for points or discard and draw new cards. It is possible to do the same action twice, but the same type of card won't activate twice in the same turn (so, if you activated the Dancer, playing a second Dancer won't trigger her ability). That is about it. Playing cards, drawing more, trying to complete sets of 5 cards sets and trading them for points. The first person to reach 20 points, wins immediately.

As expected, there is plenty of luck of the draw in [thing=132372][/thing], however the mechanisms of the abilities allow to lower this, be with the use of the Historian, in order to take cards from the discard pile, or the Dancer, to draw more cards, or the Trader, that allows to (forceful) trade cards with someone, or the Weaver which makes the person put cards from their hand on the table faster. Tje interaction between the abilities also is interesting and make for some important decisions - such as playing a card that matters little for you, but will, later allow you to trade it with someone else without harm a strong set you are building.

Choices will be constant, but many of the time you will play what you hand allows you. With only one destructive ability (from the Assassin), the play usually is going forward, still, sometimes, a player can feel like she is "locked" and can't really do anything until one or other particular card shows up, which can lead to a boring time. This is not often the case, though. 

Overall, [thing=132372][/thing] delivers a nice experience. I'm not thrill by it - it just didn't took my attention nor truly made me wanting more and more. I enjoyed, but the race aspect coupled with the amount of luck the game has, turned it simply an OK option in my book. I will play it, but definitely won't seek it out.

First play felt too chaotic, but a second play showed that this is a game of maneuvering yourself into a position where other players can't gain anything by competing with you.

Be ready to catch the wave when it passes.

Easy to teach and learn. Artwork is ok and game component quality is above average. The main game mechanic encourages targeting of the perceived leader, which is the main source of player interaction. Playing well requires one to hide your true intentions well and pulling off a chain of actions.

This cardgame is explained very shortly and has many options to play it. I played it with three players, which would be the optimal number of players to play the game with...
On my wishlist.

The game is good, especially with two players, but the Italian "pirate" retheme makes no sense at all!

6 professions in 5 different colors. Manage to get them together, and you’ll score points. First player who has 20 points wins. Is it that easy? Well, of course each profession has special abilities, which will make it harder for the other player to get their colors and professions together, or which abilities will make it easier for you to manage to get everything together, but the game isn’t that hard. A players turn takes 3 steps:

    Play a card into his play area. Resolve the special ability that is shown on the card and place the card into your guildhall.
    Discard as many cards as you like, and fill your hand back with 6 cards.
    Buy a victory point card with one or two completed chapters (1 profession of 5 different colors), and resolve the action shown on it (if it has any)

When placing a card in your guildhall, there is only one restriction. Yo can’t place a card of the same profession and color (no two red farmers) into your guildhall. If you do so, you’ll have to discard both of them.

The special abilities of the different professions are all very strong, and may become handy every once and a while. The thing I particularly like about them, is the fact, that the abilities become stronger when you have more cards of the same profession in your guildhall.  They are well balanced, and will provide a lot of interaction during the game. This is a fun game, and it’s deeper then I thought it would be. Looks like a game for gamers and non-gamers to me. The symbols on the card are pretty clear once explained.

When I looked up this game in the game stores, the price of it scared me away. EUR25,- for 120 cards and 52 cardboard-tokens, that are placed into a box in which would fit easily 500 cards and 250 tokens. This is just a cardgame, with two stacks of cards. There is nothing that would justify a price of more then EUR15,-

Quite good game! I enjoy this little card game, although I would also like to play it more often.

A great little filler. There's nice amount of interaction here and timing is important. The race to 20 points can end suddenly so you have to watch your opponents which creates some nice tension. At the moment some character powers seem less useful than others but I'm looking forward to exploring them to see if this is true.

Some of the best elements of CCGs and deckbuilding games condensed into a simple tableau builder without sacrificing the sense of depth or excitement. Luck of the cards is a greater factor than I'd like, but tactical options are often varied and paramount.

This is a FANTASTIC take that card game. You are constantly messing up your opponents in your attempts to complete your Guilds and get victory points. It is just a constant back and forth as you try to figure out the best way to make use of powers, inevitably screwing someone else over.

GAME: Lightning: Midway – June 4th to June 6th, 1942
RANK: 3965

RATING: N/A
Complete & the cards have never been shuffled

RATING: 8
A game that looks simple to play but needs good tactics to to win .
The first plays are a matter of all out attack and counter attack.
After a few games one learns to limit attacks and defences while a decicive force can be mustered.
A good hand of Leader ,Event, Tactics, Speical cards needs to be biult up too.
A massive attack is not allways the way to victory.

Good box size and nice cards
Rules could be a bit clearer to use.
3 more titles in the series.

RATING: 5
This is just too abstract for what I'm looking for in a Midway game.  It feels more like something you would play with a standard deck of cards than feeling like a war game (ex: only one red card can be on the board at any time, and one blue card, etc).

The Fires of Midway is a lot better game if you want a simple card game on the battle with some historical feel.

RATING: 5.5
Simple fast and fun gameplay. Theme is pasted on as I do not feel the battle to be anymore than MtG on Midway.

RATING: 7
This is after only one play, will revise the rating after further.  Good filler that suffers from the poorly published rules.  Be sure to download the FAQ which has good clarifications.  The historical flavor is definitely there.  Tough decision as to whether to launch counterstrike or not.

RATING: 8
A fast playing game, but it is tough for new players to wrap their head around it.  The box says it is playable in 30 minutes.  I don't think so.

Lots of options with lots of tough strategic choices to make during play.

Se volete un gioco semplicissimo da poter giocare aspettando l'autobus o in treno o mentre fate la coda alla posta, questo è il gioco ideale. Facilissimo nelle regole ma con una profondità strategica inusuale per un gioco così semplice. Rispetto a a D-Day della stessa serie è leggermente minore.

RATING: 7
On the fence with this one. The battle system seems to fit the theme quite well (keeping planes in reserve, etc) but I think we played a few rules wrong so I'm not sure if the perceived randomness is present or not. Maybe it'll get back to the table one day and I'll find out...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting filler. Asymmetric sides works, and it definitely gives the feel for carrier warfare - committing your forces to a strike leaves you vulnerable to a counter-strike. Plays a bit like Magic the Gathering, bit of luck of the draw and a lot of at what point do you have enough table 'advantage' or cards in hand to risk an attack ...
Like it. On the surface the UJN seem to have the advantage, as the US you need to take advantage of the Midway forces.

*** Update, elipsed by North Africa version, not seeing any play now. Traded.

I don't understand the folks who say this one is better than Lightning: D-Day. I liked D-Day OK. But this one has more interesting decisions, to me.

The simulation of carrier battles works, in a very simple shell. Nice work. The thing that's added here is an aspect of deck management. Particularly with the "No Target" cards, you need to pay attention to who still has those available. Cycling through cards is an important element. 

I'm not usually a very big fan of card games, but this quick little battle just works for me. I like the assymetry.

The lightning series may be appealing to non-BGGs for its historical content and wargamers may find the game mechanics provide the possibility of an epic game with relatively few cards.
Midway is the best in the series.

RATING: 7
Nice little two player card game.  It is always fun to send out a huge sortie only to see it get lost.  It takes a few plays to understand that there is more to the game than just throwing cards down.  Each side plays slightly different.  Not huge, but enough to make it interesting.

Quite good at creating the carrier-warfare angst of when to launch an attack and when to build up. Also the vulnerability of the carriers after an attack while reloading is going on.
OTOH, I didn't feel like I had much control.
Rules are probably a bit too brief (ie slightly ambiguous).

Fun and fast.  This card game some how does a good job of capturing the theme.  Sure there is a dose of luck in this game, but there are plenty of opportunities for clever card play, bluff and pushing your luck.

The rules are terribly written, but there is a good FAQ at Consim.

If you like WWII games add this to your collection.

The cards are well-detailed and are interesting in their effect of gameplay but the gameplay loses its fun factor as the game progresses. Feels too draggy for a 2-player filler. Would prefer other fillers to this. Moreover, some cards are very powerful (like No Target) and serve as gamebreakers depending on who draws them at what time.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting and tense assymetrical CCG-like card game that gives a feel of aircraft carrier warfare.  Most regard it as slightly superior to Lightning D-Day, another game in the same series.  The rules have been criticized for being inadequate, but they weren't as terrible as I'd been led to believe, especially if you consult this FAQ: http://bgg.cc/file/download/9769/Midway_Q_&_A.doc  Players who have any experience with games like MtG will find the game very easy to grasp and the rules quite straight-forward, in fact the whole attack/defense concept is somewhat reminiscent of attacking and blocking in MtG.  Tense decisions about whether to attack or defend, and careful hand management and timing is required!  Quality game, even if it doesn't have the staying power of other two-player games like Roma or Hera & Zeus.

What an awesome game this is! The way action cards are played in order to support your attacking/defending forces is just genius. I can't believe a simple card game can have so much depth. Love it!

RATING: 5
An improvement over D-Day.  The game just seems better suited with this theme.  Much like the Down in Flames series by the same author, the play is fast and furious with some cards creating wild swings of fortune which almost wrecks it totally for me.  Not bad but not great either.

Quick little compact card game that has somewhat of a wargame feel.  It surpassed my expectations as there are frequent difficult decisions about how many forces to attack with, how many to leave behind for defending, which objectives to attack, and when to resupply.  Great bang for one's buck!

RATING: 5
Fun every once in awhile. If you feel you got a raw deal, the game is quick enough to change sides and give it another go. Keep some planes in reserve or you may not have anything to defend yourself when the enemy strike comes over the horizon. The counting and re-counting can wear you out after a couple trips through the deck, and it feels anticlimatic that your best defensive card is the "No Target" card, which cancels an incoming raid. Still, for such a light package the game does a very good job of showing the tempo of carrier operations, and if you know where to look, you'll see a little bit of history, too. So for history, Lightning: Midway ranks a bit ahead of Brawling Battleships or Battlegroup, but for fun it trails those games by equivalent measure.

Represents the battle quite well, with the balance between attacking the opposing fleet and keeping enough to protect you own carriers.  Can be over quickly however is one draws the All-Out Strike card when his opponent is low on resources.

RATING: 5
The "Magic the Gathering" nature of carrier warfare is well represented here.  Yes, you can attack with everything, but will you survive the counter punch.  Unfortunately, I've seen this mechanic in so many card games now, it just does not have the novelty that it used to.  Still, not bad filler.

RATING: 5
A decent filler somewhat marred by rules that lack basic explanations. For example, your hand limit is nine, so when you go over nine by pulling committed forces back into your hand, when do you discard? The word "discard" is not even in the rules. I also have concerns about a saminess setting in after a few games. Although initially enjoyable enough, I can't score this any higher.

Very impressed with this design.  It plays fast and has an excellent feel.

Simple, but very nice card game.  Compromises must be made; it largely skips the detection aspect so crucial to the battle, and airpower rarely gets destroyed unless the parent carrier is lost.  Lasted twice as long as stated.  A mediocre rating, though, only because for a simple Midway game, I'd rather play the hex-and-counter XTR offering; for a similar-feel card game, I'd rather play Blue Moon.

Terrible rules; you have to read one of the FAQs here in order to play.

After 5 plays with 3 opponents: it's fast & easy, which I like, and certainly there's some tension & tough choices, but it feels awfully heavy on the luck of the card draws, maybe [i]too[/i] heavy.  Tonight, between this and [gameid=1265], we went for the latter because we'd had more fun with it a few days earlier.

One funny thing: the first three times I played, the US won, so I was a little baffled that there was a "How can the USA win?" thread.  But the fourth game was hopeless for the US right out of the gate, and I can see how that would happen again in future games.

A card game on the Midway campaign.  Short, crisp, fun and as exciting as the Admirals finding out the bad guys before they find you. Card mechanics is by nature a far better choice in simulating a sea campaign than an air dogfight. A game of cards play and learning history in a simple, easy and fun atmosphere.  This kind of game should be encourged more among colleges, high schools. family or social gatherings.  If people like to play pokers, why not cards with historical military unit designations, military operations or strategies?  

The game contains only 1 page of normal magazine rule.  U.S. player always go first.  He can perform one of the following three actions: Assault, Resupply or Prepare.  If you assault, choose an objective card from your opponent and deploy your force cards in hand to attack.  After both sides deploy their forces, additionally, each player can play one or more Event, Tactic r Leader cards to boost up the force value.  Naturally, he who has the higher force value wins the battle.  The game ends when the first player destroy all enemy objectives and is declared the winner of the game.   

Sure bet for your money invested in this game, which can be played within 30 minutes for one game as a natural filler between game breaks.  A vote of confidence on Dan this time.  (This game was out-shined by the latter GMT's Pacific Typhoon which has a more intense, interactive and competitive game play.)

Consider this an initial rating.  I've played a handful of times, but have to play a few more times to get a definitive one.  With other fun wargames that play in around the same amout of time or just a bit longer (Battle Cry, Clash for a Continent), this doesn't come out often.  That said, it's a neat game that appears to me to show the basics of timing carrier raids, balancing prepping your forces, leaving defenses, etc.  The poorly-written rules are very similar to, if in an extremely simplified form, the rules for Legend of the Five Rings.

I tried very hard to like this game a lot.  It does a great job "simulating" the prep, attack and retrieval aspects of a carrier battle, but the "ebb and flow waves" (although "realistic") aren't tremendously "fun" in practice.

RATING: 5
Heck, I don't know how to rate this. It's okay, it's fast, the cards are nice. But after only one play, I don't really see what the strategies are. Are there effective strategies? Or is it mostly luck of the draw?

I won by using the knock out card on my opponent's last two carriers. I didn't have much in my hand (mostly more special cards), but he only had three cards total and I decided to gamble. It paid off, and I had just enough to win.

Unlike many 5-rated games on my list, I could easily be persuaded to play again. It's fast, and there's shooting and exploding. I remain curious whether there are deeper strategies.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Pros: - great theme with matching mechanics
- I liked the "pacing" of the game, where some rounds must be spent regrouping, the attack vs drawing cards conundrum
- Lots of strategy/options to chose from; small raids vs all-out air combat; when to play this or that tactic/leader/event card, etc. 
Cons: The japanese fleet seems waaay overpowered versus the americans'. Would be willing to play the game a couple times more to prove myself wrong (and if it does turn out that I'm wrong, my rating would shoot up to 7.5/8)

I think the game play for this one works better than for Lightning: D-Day; however, again I have to say the rules are so sketchily written that there are gaping holes that can only be filled in with the help of Q&A blogs here on BGG. 

I spent so much time figuring out and rewriting the rules that I put this game aside for a long time. However, I've played it through and, after some 6-10 plays I felt like I was playing it the way it was intended, and indeed, it does play well. 

One has to make tough decisions about when to play cards and how many to hold back for key strikes. Knowing when to hold is very important, so on that score it's an impressive design, as it does infuse a sense of theme. 

For me this is one of those games like "Hellas," in which I sensed there's a good game somewhere underneath rules that are either underwritten ("Lightning: Midway") or perhaps lacking in translation ("Hellas"). In both cases, now that I feel like I'm playing the games the way intended by their authors, these games are well designed. Also, after playing many times, I think a board with appropriate artwork, on which to play cards, would have been a plus, even though it would have increased the cost. 

In all, a well-designed game that I wish would have had equally clearly-written rules.

Fun card game in a small box. Simple enough but the rules are poorly written - need FAQs to clarify.

Card quality is fine. Box is large enough to hold sleeved cards if you so wished, although the cards are a little too long and too narrow for Yu-Gi-Oh-sized sleeves.

Has some of the same feeling of card play & combos as a CCG. When an attack is triggered, it is perhaps comparable with something like Blue Moon, with the back & forth struggle to get the higher combat value.

This game seems to be deeper though. For example, there is some scope for long-term planning, as you can prepare & organise units which persist outside of each individual attack.

Great, really great system, really great game. Mandatory 2 players and do not expect the perfect simmulation game. In fact this title is just a fantastic card game and Midway battle is just the costume that dress it. You can apply this system at whatever other situation you might imagine. Despite of this, a match is fast (45 minutes to 1 hour) with a lot of tension and thriller. Best for gamers, disappointing for grognards

Nice. Probably the longer (that is less lightning) of the lightning WWII games.

Not bad for a game with lots of card text, which I usually avoid like the plague. You don't have to spend too much of your time reading here.

--Sept2007-- More than 30 months on the shelf, and finally a play.  It's quite engaging!  More of an explicit hand-management game than D-Day, but very playable for all that.

As a straight card game goes,this game gives you a feel of back and forth air battles of carrier warfare. A good sortment of tactical history in the cards,along with special and event cards to add flavor to the battle.

RATING: 8
[8 plays] It is fairly luck dependent and certain great cards early will make you hard to beat. But it offers enough challenges to be fun and tense almost every time. You can choose to go for broke, but most of the time you should always hold back a little bit for the opponent's counterpunch. Almost always plays very fast, this game is light and fun. This is the most strongly themed of the "Lightning" games.

Most recent plays 7-2-06 with Garrett at Net Lake.

Fast playing beer and pretzels card game on Midway. Players have a hand of cards related to either the US or Japanese and are trying to sink the other player's carriers.

The luck of the draw is frustrating but it's short enough that one can just start another hand if you lose.

RATING: 8
The theme is great, but this is a deceptively strategic 2-player card game. You must choose your attack and defense plays carefully, often sacrificing one of your objectives to counter-attack. Can get nasty. And that's a good thing.

Finally got a full game in at GenghisCon 2008. Americans lost - got bad card draws, but a short game so that is OK.  Looking forward to more.

Enjoyable, fast card game.  First time I played, I didn't know the card mix, and had my Japanese air strikes foiled by missed target cards every time!

Tem um sistema de combate curioso e é muito bem adaptado ao tema. Melhor que o d-day da mesma série.

RATING: 8
It's quick and I really like the ebb and flow of the battles back and forth across the table.  You either attack, reinforce or draw cards.  When you battle all units come back to your hand and 3 can be played to the table on your next turn.  Seems quite clever but after two plays the Japanese seem much stronger.  Perhaps we were missing something.  The rules are short and subject to a bit of interpretation. but we managed to get just about everything with a little common sense. 2006/02/09

RATING: 8
Great war cardgame.  Badly-written rules, but with FAQs, very easy to learn and play.  Good feeling of the battle, but it is not a simulation.  I like this one a little better than Lightning: D-Day, although this may be a little more difficult to play well.  See my review:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/858292#858292

Not as much fun as D:Day, or North Africa, but for only $20, it can be an interesting diversion on a rainy afternoon.

RATING: 6
Similar to Lightning: D-Day in many respects, Lightning: Midway is a bit more unstructured and freewheeling. Strategy definitely plays a part, but I think the luck factor in Midway is a bit higher, especially given that players are drawing up to nine cards at a time. The ebb and flow of the game is interesting. Use of the "No Target" cards can be crucial. The American deck is probably a bit trickier than the the Japanese deck to play. In all, Lightning: Midway probably won't hit the table all that often, but it's interesting enough for occasional play.

This game really captures the feel of the battle as far as having planes ready to attack & to protect your carriers. A lot packed into this card game.

Very nice little card game with a wargame-y feel. Unfortunately, while the rules themselves are excellent, the printed rules are terribly incomplete - reading the online FAQ is mandatory. It's also rather pricey for what it is (just a deck of cards, really). Still, excellent gameplay in a small, fast-playing package.

Excellent, nice play.  Both times played with people who either have little interest in war games or naval battles. Both really liked it. My last game we managed to almost exactly re-create the real battle (something BGG did not find interesting, in fact), a major US victory. Very interesting and a credit to Verseen.

marked at this rating as i slightly prefere it too d-day. can take a long time due to there being no time limit on the game but its still very good and has a good feel for what is meant to represent. nice game with the theme well interagated.

RATING: 6.5
A pretty good filler game, but I really sucked at it. We played three games. I lost twice as the US and once as the Japanese. A little frustrating because I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong or what strategy might work better.

RATING: 7
Quick and easy to learn - but great hand management/force management choices. I especially like the mechanic of picking up committed forces so that they have to be recycled to the playable forces area - simulates the planes heading to their carriers (base) for fuel/rearmament. Fun!

I like this one better than D-day.  You have to plan more as the US to sink the IJN.  Nice mechanism to ready your strike force again after a battle.

This may have been the game that taught me the meaning of the word "FAQ".

What is needed, clearly, is a card almanac to go with the post-it sized rulebook.

I really want to like this game more.  It just seems to me that America doesn't stand a chance.  I may need to run some similations before I give up on this game.

EDIT: In a recent solitaire game America came very close to winning.  Luck will play a factor for both sides but I do now see more of what the USA needs to do in order to win.  I want to play this more and against someone else.

Nice little game.  Good concept for a card game.  Fast paced and decent historically.

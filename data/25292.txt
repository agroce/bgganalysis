What can I say? You get to be a Pirate.
It's basically, Assassin's Creed Black Flag: The Board Game. I love it.

Thematically this game is stunning - probably my favourite aspect about this game. 

I don't think there's been a single time where we aren't talking about some sort of event that happened for weeks! One game I died 4 times! Each death had a fantastic (or hilarious) story. Another time two player captains went in an epic head to head - and it ended in a tie!
This game is simply phenomenal, and the various tweaks and additions that can be found here on BGG can really add to the game too.

Simply put: This is my favourite game of all time.

Merchants and Marauders is a favorite of mine. It is a great thematic game because it really feels like you are a pirate. At the same time there is more too it than just rolling the dice and getting lucky. Your decisions have a greater impact on winning than pure dumb luck. All together the theme, strategic depth, and quality components make this a great game IMO.

The perfect pirate game and to be played in the thematic adventure sense. Dice rolling , events, miniatures (which we painted), missions, rumours, rum running, great production though no mention of parrots in the whole game which was odd.... The expansion better have parrots in the title to make up for this school boy error. See my further thoughts here: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6746266

It's a huge game, however, It can be so long and I think that is too much easier to be merchant than a pirate. Ever I've played as a Merchant during a gameplay I got much more victory points than being a marauder, only selling goods in ports. I've played once so I may be wrong, but it`s been my first impression.

This game can be a lot of fun - Once you learn to play, which does take awhile since there is a lot going on.  But if you play adventurously it is a lot of fun.  The luck you get rolling the device is a big factor though in how you do.  Last game I played I started off terrible terrible terrible.  I couldn't scout $#%!.  But then after awhile, I was hitting skulls like you wouldn't believe in combat.

RATING: 6.5
This game indeed meets the expectations of a fun pirate game. It may be difficult to win as a pirate, but I don't think that takes away from the sheer enjoyment (and surely a house-rule could fix this). There's a simple routine to playing, a rhythm that might become dry after several games - and simply sailing about buying and selling is early on an obvious strategy. But this game demands more than selling bananas and tobacco. For me, you need to raid merchant ships and escape thuggish frigates from nations with a bounty on your head. This is my favorite pirate/ship game so far.

Oh my god. How much downtime can there be in a game… Everybody played quick and still it felt like all you did was wait and wait and wait. Then you decided to go to the toilet and chase the badger out of its hole. And when you get back it is still not your turn.

Merchants and Marauders could have been a fun pick up and deliver game but it would have required the game being stripped all unnecessary fluff like the rumors, glory cards, zillions of ship attributes, and most importantly the over complicated and long battle would have needed simplifying. Now a single battle could take 15 minutes and all the while players not involved in the battle have nothing to do.

Mechanically there is nothing broken and there are no fatal design errors. The whole game just feels like all the mechanics were taken from a board game published 40 years ago. There is nothing innovative or elegant. Everything is slow and clunky. 

The only good thing I have to say about Merchants and Marauders is that it looks good and I really like the theme. Completing missions, trading goods and sinking ships is also fun, but it would need to happen at a pace 100x faster.

I had been looking forward to giving M&M a try for quite some time and recently got the chance to play a game with a friend's copy.  I went in expecting a 3-hour marathon of high seas intrigue and ship-to-ship combat.  Instead, the game finished in under 2 hours and the winner had reached 11 Glory, with the other 3 competitors at 2, 2, and 1 Glory each.  Needless to say, this was a less than satisfying game.

While I was one of the also-rans in this particular game, I am not so competitive that losing a game will sour my impressions of it.  Instead, what bothered me was that the game was no contest.  The winner had everything go his way.  Granted, he made good choices and took advantage of his luck, but he so outpaced everyone else that it killed any sense of tension in the game.  Perhaps the other players could have set out to try to sink him, but he was the first to gain a big ship and completely outclassed everyone else.  I expected M&M to have a high degree of luck involved, but it was still disappointing to have all the luck go in one player's favor.  I'd be willing to give it another try at some point, but this experience really dampened my excitement.

UPDATE: I got the chance to play this a second time, and even with lowered expectations after my first play, I didn't come away with any higher opinion.  This game ended with a closer score (10-5-4), but the ending was abrupt and anti-climactic.  It simply seems that being a merchant is a much easier way to win than through pirating.  Getting glory both for trading in three in-demand goods, along with the money from the trade, seem to be much more efficient than raiding merchant ships, with less risk involved.  While I suppose I'd be willing to play this on occasion, I can't imagine myself asking to play it.  My rating of a 6 will stand.

+Lots of gameplay options.
+Great job of capturing the theme.
+Awesome plastic ships.
+Allows for both peaceful (merchant) and aggressive (marauder) strategies.
+Well-designed player aids.

-High degree of randomness can lead to a runaway leader.
-Lots of downtime, especially when opponents take a porting action and you do not.
-Many of the ship upgrades are geared towards combat, which seems to be a relatively minor part of the game (at least in my one play).
-Some fiddly rules (e.g. special weapons, harbor rules, crew combat).
-Merchant strategy much more effective than marauder strategy.
-Anti-climactic end game.

Merchants and Marauders is a game that we enjoy, but there are a few too many moving parts for my liking.  It's a great Caribbean simulator, but the combat rules are difficult to grasp and it feels, at times, bloated with too much content.  I'd like to see this game streamlined in a new edition.

Love the theme, love the mechanics, love the tension, love the components.  One of my favorite Eurogames of all time.  Takes a huge amount of real estate, though, as you have a big board and lots of stuff to go with it.  Small price to pay.  Only quibble is that merchants always seem to win, no matter how aggressive the pirate players are.  Seas of Glory helps to address this, though not entirely.

The combat in this game is a little more complicated than it needed to be, but other than that this is a fun sea-faring game! The balance is spot-on. I've seen merchants win out over pirates and vice-versa. You really just need to know how to play your role.

Great pirate theme! This game has very similar mechanics to Sid Meier´s Pirates on the C64 - so cool!
There are several ways to get victory points which is quite nice and you can always switch between a merchant and a pirate as you wish.
Defenitly this game plays best with more players so there is simply much more action on the board.

I so want to love this game...

Pros:
- pirates!
- beautiful board and components
- multiple ways to earn points and multiple paths to victory but only if playing with aggressive players
- nice thematic touches with rumour cards and missions
- the sense of dread when NPCs or other players are coming for you and you are holding a full load of great cargo (but again only if other players are aggressive)

Cons:
- absolutely need the right group of players (aggressive, tactically minded, prone to quick analyses, and fun)
- sometimes has very low decision making and too much time between turns leading to a feeling of a slow playing game (this is particularly frustrating for me)
- playing the merchant can become very boring if the pirates are not aggressive, as the pick up and deliver aspect has little decision making in itself

+ Incredibly immersive theme throughout the different mechanics; Different playstyle based on being a pirate or merchant.
- Takes a bit long with any more than 2 players.


Why it's previously-owned:
The length really killed this getting to the table.  And if a game isn't going to get played, it's time to move it out.  
This got traded for High Frontier.

It looks like there'd be something here, and the board and parts are pretty.  Alas, at the heart of the missions/rumors/upgrades is a tedious pair of games:  merchant raiding for pirates and "collect 3 in demand" for merchants.  Tedium in a nice outfit.  Doesn't feel at all piratey-swashbuckly, and as a euro it's both over luckish/unbalanced and overcomplicated.  Too bad.

RATING: 6
Components are great. Storyline from cards are pretty good. 

With 4 players, downtime is significant. Overall, it lacked a little bit of something. ( lacked both in pirate flavor and merchant buy/sell feeling) Dice part makes the gameplay variable. 

Not a bad game, but not great either.

I really like this game, and it is perfect for a Saturday game day with 2-3 other people.  It takes a good 3-4 hours, but all that time is spent having a great time.  It has been said by others, but it is so true, you need to pressure people to be ready for their turns and take them in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't get it. I can almost always get through my turns in a minute or two, sometimes just 20 seconds.  But others can take FOREVER.  Sell, Buy, Fix your ship, get event, hear rumor, recruit crew.  That's it.  It does not need to take forever, and if you let people sit there take their time, the game will not end.

All that said.  If people will just resolve to be ready for their turns and take them, this game is an absolute blast.  It is so much more fun to be a pirate.  I don't care how much better it is points wise to be a merchant.

The most well-themed game I have ever played! "Dripping" with theme? Nahhh: we had to use bath towels afterwards to wipe up the table! Extremely well-themed; and historically accurate, too! That's why it's a hard job being a pirate in M&M: historically, it was a challenge to be a successful pirate.
Be warned: your first game or two will seem dreadfully long. But it's amazing how quickly the length of a game of M&M shortens with subsequent plays.
You will also find the rules to be exceedingly fiddly. That's only because they are! BUT: a few plays will get you used to the system. And for those of us whose birth certificate indicates a certain unfortunate fact, the font size on the cards (and to a lesser extent the board) might be a "little" annoying!
Once you get past that, though, you have an outstanding game of risk management that is also well themed. Many people here have lamented the huge luck factor in the game, and there is a HUUUGE amount of luck. But the key to the game is how do I manage the gobs of luck? You have to learn when to take risks, and when to avoid them like scurvy. And that ain't easy, since there are so many options to choose from. Some of those options are very good for pirates; some of them are very bad. Some are very good for merchants; some are very bad. I think merchants do have the advantage, generally, but an average merchant, in my opinion, will NOT be able to win against a clever pirate. The first thing a pirate has to do is to accept the fact that he's going to be beaten up a lot, and focus not only on risk management, but on loss management as well. For example: a pirate losing his sloop is not (necessarily) a disaster; a pirate losing his frigate IS!!!
I suspect I may not want to play M&M with AP prone players, however: there is an awful lot to consider in most turns!

  I love this game, be a pirate and roam the seas as a scurvy villain, or peacefully hop from port to port as a wholesome merchant, or maybe a bit of both.

  The idea of the game as either role is to accrue gold and glory. Get both from either selling goods that are in demand at ports or heading out to sea to raid merchant vessels and sink other ships.

  The game plays very well but has a little too much down time and many people find the combat mechanics clunky... I put this down to a lack of imagination; if you can well imagine how a sea battle will play out from the moment you spot an enemy ship, then you should be able to grasp why the combat works how it does, if you don't, then you'll be rolling dice with no idea why.

  The artwork is beautiful and the rumour and mission cards really get you into the role of your captain. There is a lot to keep track of but at the end of the day, it's a fairly easy game to pick up. Yahaarrrr me hearties, this be gettin 9 dubloons!

  P.S.. Don't get too attached to your captain if you are a pirate, he will die eventually.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
A so-called "sandbox" adventure game saddled somewhere between smooth Euro mechanics, daring dice fests, and press-your-luck. Intrigue, flavor text, supply and demand, lots of ship stat customization, smart NPC AI for multiple factions, tremendous artwork, interesting plot in missions and rumors, high risk-versus-reward gameplay, set collection, emergent alliances, lots of variable action spots, with very thematic combat dice-based combat and choose-your-own-adventure style paths to victory.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The narrative is amazing in this game. Even playing it with the goal of sheer points optimization, a player cannot ignore the story that develops as his or her captain embarks into the sea with their strengths and weaknesses in tow, slowly changing as rumors, missions, close-calls, raids, epic sales, dramatic events, and rowdy player interaction all mingle together into something much greater than the sum of its parts. I once had a crappy sloop which was able to raid and capture a frigate from the Royal English navy by calling in the help of a nearby privateer captain. Between the captain's crew and my guns, the huge frigate was slowly whittled down to a single crew member, and my crew was able to prevail on the final die roll...!

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
There is a great deal of strategy and mitigation in this game, but some aspects are definitely boiled down to luck. Granted, I usually play a Marauder, which is inherently more press-your-luck than the steady consistency of playing as a Merchant... :whistle::arrrh:

[hr]
As a glimpse into the tremendous world of this game, I'll describe a single session which had a spectacular interaction:

I was able to claim a mission called "Joined Forces" which allowed me, as a marauder in a lowly sloop, to engage an English frigate in St. John... with the help of the pirate sloop NPC on the board. Basically, I rolled for the pirate sloop and my friend rolled for the frigate... it was a deathmatch and we ended up killing all of each other's crew in the same final roll. Since the frigate had more successes in the roll, he "won" and the pirate sloop was destroyed (R.I.P. "Long Ben Avery")... at which point MY ship got to join the combat, and I boarded the crew-less frigate in a single roll and claimed it for myself. From there, I ended the game when a Spanish frigate populated in Havana where I was sitting out to sea. I engaged it once it scouted me and I sunk that sucker to the bottom of the ocean for my final necessary glory point.

It seems to take too long, and there's so much to keep track of.  I don't remember another game where we had to flip through the rulebook so much.  What's worse, I actually found myself not wanting to finish the game, which hasn't happened in quite some time.  We actually agreed to quit before we finished.  This game seems great in concept, but there's just too much going on.  I wonder, however, if this might change with greater familiarity of the rules.  I could see my rating of this game moving up a point after future plays.  There were some things I liked.  For example, I like how the combat works, where each player announces 1 of 3 combat tactics, and then rolls for Seamanship to determine who gets to execute their tactic.  The theme is also ever-present throughout the game, and the components are very good.  Unfortunately, game play seems too tedious (at the moment, at least).

After the first play, the game seems enjoyable. There's not so much down time as I expected, but the game is not so complex, but rather complicated. After 10 turns the winner was obvious, so we stopped, but we'll play again very soon. The plastic miniatures are lovely, they game is worth the money. There's quite little to complain and a lot to appreciate, I guess the rating will change slightly after a few more plays.

This was a game that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Having never played the game, I came into it with a not much more experienced group of players. The many different aspects were explained as best as the owner could do and the game play was about as exciting as it could be. I loved it.

RATING: 7
Some good, if overly complex and long-playing mecahnics. My gripe with the game is its map. Any Caribbean piracy game that claims to be inclusive of the "Golden Age" of pirate history has to include far more geography than what this map shows. Where is the the Belize coastline, the only nation founded by pirates? Where is the Mexican city of Campeche, the main historical source for pirates sacking a city? Where is the US southern states coastline where the most complete annals of pirate history reside including the infamous Blackbeard?

Alguna partida e intento de partida no registrado.

Juego de piratas en el que la estrategia ganadora es hacerte comerciante (!!!!).
Se ha intentado hacer algún apaño para que ser comerciante no sea tan potente, pero no me acaba de gustar. Da la impresión de estar poco testeado.
En la parte negativa tb. hay demasiado texto en todas partes... cartas, tablero,... y además muy pequeño, lo que resulta muy cansado aunque tengas un inglés fluido (las cartas son pequeñas y muchas tienen texto a rebosar).
La mecánica de combate es algo farragosa.

En la parte buena, tiene una producción soberbia, con componentes de muy buena calidad e ideas chulas (el cofre para guardar tu tesoro).

Pero pese a todo, me resulta un juego bastante fallido porque hacerse comerciante es siempre más potente (mucho beneficio con poco riesgo) que ser pirata (riesgo extremo).

RATING: 8
Rating based on one play.

I've been disappointed with a lot of the latest big theme games, but this was an exception.  It's nicely produced and designed and the best part is how there are so many ways to score.  

You can act as a merchant and move goods around, go pirate and steal from NPCs and other players, or focus on completing missions and investigating rumors.  And really, you'll probably focus on several things at the same time.  

The piracy system offers some nice trade-offs. You can score big and possibly slow down another player, but the bounties placed on your head restrict your options elsewhere.

One complaint might be that the game finished just as it felt like it was getting started.  A few of us had just built larger ships, some navy ships had arrived on the board, but we hadn't yet done any ship to ship combat.  We could have increased the Glory Point requirement, but it had already been a few hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As a sucker for Ameritrashy adventure games, I always knew I would like this.  The review at Shut Up and Sit Down really sold me on it, and I was not disappointed. A fun sandbox game of sailing around and scoring glory points in various ways is transformed into something special by an absolutely brutal combat system.  If another player kills you they take everything you have. Everything! But isn't that the life of a pirate?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
NOTE: Game might have changed from prototype!

Impressions after two games:

Overall: Fun!
Manages to capture the feel of sailing the seas, of pirating and trading very well. Lots of theme, lots of cards with texts on them, lots of dice, too. 

Risk-taking is a big part of the game, and it can be really nasty: Storms force you around, wars prevent you from trading where you wanted to, and of course, big baddy Blackbeard had to attack you, of all ships.

However, bad things happen to everyone (there's a whole lot of fun watching the trouble of other players), and even after a series of bad rolls and card draws, or after dying three times (as I did in my second game), you might still win in the end.

Even so, if you can't live with temporary (random) setbacks, the game is probably not for you.

The game mechanics are simultaneous action selection (which direction am I going to sail? Or would I rather go to port, scout for ships to combat, or try to follow another ship?), commodity demand by randomly drawing chits, random events from a card deck, and rumor cards that the players draw.

You have lots to do and decide. Am I going to be pirate or trader? Am I going to pursue a rumor, or rather try to make money by trading or sinking merchant ships? Should I upgrade the ship I have, or rather save the money for a better ship? And so on.

I'd love to play it again...

UPDATE:
Published version, played one two-player and one three-player game. Although some rules have changed, the feel of the game is still the same, and I see my current rating confirmed.

UPDATE 2:
The game did lose some flavor as compared to the beta version, but it plays a lot shorter.
Luck can be a massive factor. The fact that now players can turtle from harbor to harbor means that in some cases, lucky players are hard to attack, and therefore can reach their 10 glory points rather quickly.

Amazing, amazing game. Play with the cutthroat variant (in the FAQ) and with the variant that requires victory points from at least five sources (on BGG). You will be crushed when everything you have is taken away from you. But you will forever remember taking everything back- the best American-style game I've played, probably.

Played with the expansion once- surprisingly I did not end up feeling the need to buy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
The combat here is the one thing holding the game back from a slightly higher rating, I do feel it becomes a little arbitrary having the different combat systems for different circumstances. Otherwise this is an excellent game, with variable Captain abilities, choice to go either merchant or pirate, programmable NPCs that can chase after you, and a solid trading game component in there. Will not leave my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating is after initial game play.

Definitely the best pirate game that I've played, however it is fairly long.  My biggest fear is that in the long run it's too light for the game length.

On the positive side there is a real narrative to this game, and plenty of interesting choices.  It does seem that players can get up and running with this game fairly quickly.  After first play it does seem that the pirate route is the best route to go.

Definitely looking forward to more play of this one.

I like the trading and some of the fighting.  The port personalities are neet and add to the strategy, but then the the random missions or rumors seems to take the strategy back out.  When you remove them from the game and stick to trading and fighting, the game seems to get to be a bit too long.

It's Pirates! the board game. I really like Pirates! but this is quite slow and has some balance issues. I'm reluctant to play it more, just because it doesn't engage like it should. I'd gladly while away a lazy Sunday afternoon with this, but it's just not suitable for my regular gaming meets.

RATING: 6
This game is very nearly excellent. There is a pile of flavour, interesting mechanics, lovely bits, and a good balance of luck & planning.  But ...... it is too long (at least with 4 players), with too much downtime between turns.  The port actions also take too long, however fast people try to play.  We terminated our game at 3 hours, but the likely winner was clear (and probably had been for the last 90 minutes).  Losing few knobs would greatly improve gameplay - even the players who had a played a few times before were constantly referring to the sheets - that's a bad sign.  But other than the duration, a fine game that I would enjoy playing again, but probably not with four.

8 -> 5
Downgraded due to all the fiddly little rules that need to be looked up constantly when the game is not played on a regular basis.
It is also not uncommon that player interaction only starts mid-game (that is after 1.5 hours into the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First play: thematically very strong.  Very similar to the computer game, "Sid Mier's Pirates!". I think fans of the genre and games like "Arkham Horror" or "Tales of Arabian Nights" will really enjoy this title.  (I think I like M&M better than both those two).  

The game itself suffers from a lot of the problems that "thematic games" can have.  I found the game play somewhat underwhelming.  The choices somewhat dull. Downtime (espcially with 4 new players) was also an issue.

On the other hand, Merchants and Marauders offers up a pretty solid "pirate experience", and while the choices in the game aren't thrilling, you do feel a certain amount of freedom.  There's definitly room in this game for "play".

I dont think I'll be buying this game but I certainly wouldnt mind playing it again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome components, great stuff. High quality production. This game has quite some rules to remember, takes some time to play and is somewhat heavy.
The only complaint I have is depending on the Captain that's randomly assign to you, you're more suited to either being a pirate or a merchant, because if you try to be a pirate with a captain that is very weak at seamanship you'll lose badly. Yeah you can still raid merchants and win (mostly because of special weapons), but fighting other player pirates... forget it.
I'll probably fix that by drawing only captains with the same seamanship level, 3 would be a good number. (So you can have a chance against naval ships).
Otherwise this is a very dense game and there's lots of good things going for it. You can do pretty much what a pirate would do - trade goods, fight other captains, and possibly plunder their ships, go and search for certain rumors to be true, doing all sort of missions, claim bounties, upgrade your ship, buy different ships depending on your play style and your Captain stats.
If you want a heavy and deep pirate game this is probably the one to get. But it only goes up to 4 players.

 This is perhaps the only game in my collection (~100 at the time of this comment) where every mechanic and action makes perfect thematic sense. The game play is fun and tense, the components quality is simply outrageous, and is one of the greatest experiences I have had with gaming. Even if you hate dice and luck, much of the game can be extremely Euro-y if you choose to simply trade/pickup and deliver. I really can't imagine anyone not liking this game

Hónapok óta napirenden volt a kipróbálása, végre sikerült:) Felemás az élményem. Nagyon jó ötletek is vannak a játékban, de van pár alapvető hibája.

Pozitívumok: A legfontosabb: átjön a téma!! Szép is a játék. Nagyon ötletes a csata, és a kereskedős rész sem rossz. Kicsit Senji érzésem volt, mert ott is a csata, és bizonyos kártyák gyűjtése-beváltása van házasítva, de itt jobban összeillik a kettő. A sok kockadobás ellenére se haragudtam a szerencsére, elviselhetőnek érzem (egy kalóz ellen a valóságban is kell szerencse:)).

Negatívumok: brutális lehet a holtidő 4 főnél, így maga a játék is eléggé elnyúlhat. 1 kör nekünk átlag bő negyed óra alatt ment le, ennek a 3/4-e volt a holtidő. Szerintem túl egyértelmű, hogy kereskedelmi hajókat kell rabolni. Emellett az sem tetszik, hogy valaki végigjátszhatja úgy, hogy sosem tudjuk megtámadni, mert kikötőről kikötőre ugrál. A szabály pedig nem elég egzakt, elmondani meg több mint 1 óra. Néhány dolog feleslegesen túl van bonyolítva. Nagyon nyelvfüggőek a kártyák.

A pontszám még javulhat! Most azt mondom, hogy na ezt aztán tuti nem veszem meg, de ha abból indulok ki, hogy a játék közben fokozatosan javult a véleményem, bármi megtörténhet:)
---
2. parti után, most már jól játszva elvileg minden hibát: nem rossz játék, de hosszú (45 perc x játékos úgy,hogy gyorsan pörgettük), és nagyon nagy a szerencsefüggőség. 3 órás partiban kb. 50 perccel a vége előtt 9 pontom volt, a 10. ponthoz csakis szerencsés kockadobás kellett volna... De túl későn jött, pontazonossággal bebuktam végül.

An excellent reference pirate-themed game. Personally I wish for a bit more complexity/depth/weight, however for a standard gamer the gameplay sits on the correct spot.

I would recommend this as the reference pirates' game, although I must also try GMT's blackbeard.

This game has a lot of chrome! The production is gorgeous, and there's a lot of detail with mission and rumours and the piracy part of the game...
However, under these thick layers of chrome, there are just two bland mechanics: pick up and deliver (merchants) and a simplistic wargame (marauders).
The gameplay is fun (although there's a bit of downtime between turns), but it is more of an experience than a mind challenging game. So, this is definitely not my cup of tea, but I can see its appeal for the right audience...

This is a 3 hour race game with injections of theme and randomization. It manages to be a fun experience. Each session provides a sense of danger as you maraud the seas or legally peddle your cargo at the various ports. The naval ships and pirate ships, when they are present, add to the danger. The individual turns, with a few exceptions, move pretty quickly so the game can handle four people pretty well (at least as compared to Xia). If the players aren't confrontational with each other, the game seems to come down to the success on some dice rolls. If the players are very confrontational with each other, the game can go on a bit longer than it probably should.  Under the base game rules, you have to keep an eye on a merchant who's managed to collect 50 gold, as that can quickly determine the game.

The expansion adds a lot of modules that allow the players to tune the game to their preferences. It's good, but not mandatory.

Edit: the battle resolution is too long and procedural for this sort of game. Really detracts from the marauder play style. Heck, the marauder style feels pretty poor overall compared to the simplicity of the merchant play style.

A board game version of "Sid Meirer's Pirates." This is an "experience" game that allows players to tell their own stories based on the choices they make. There is a winner and a looser, but if you have the right mindset you can have so much fun making up your own adventures that it doesn't always matter. It can be a bit long, but there are some designer created house rules to speed things up. One of my favorite games.

Most people would look at my 10 star rating with a very critical eye, but allow me the chance to explain myself!  At the time of this review I have logged 15 plays of M&M, and this is STILL my favorite game; I am always itching to play it, and I can't foresee it ever growing stale for me. There's just too much to do! Too much fun to be had! 

M&M is a sandbox Ameritrash game, and it excels at both those things. There are a great variety of strategies to employ, and they are all viable routes to victory. And for this reason, M&M does a fantastic job of emulating the feeling of being a pirate. It's also juuuuust trashy enough to introduce a random, chaotic component, but isn't so punishing that you can't recover from a small disaster (which probably will happen). There are lots of ways to mitigate disaster, but you won't always have the resources to invest in them. 

M&M is the best pirate game to date, but I recognize this game won't work for every person. If you like the golden age of piracy, sandbox-style games, and don't mind chucking dice every now and then, I urge you to give this game a try. I would also advise picking up the modular expansion, because it's very easy to incorporate and adds some fantastic new mechanics.

This game is a lot of fun but seems to end a bit too fast with the standard rules. My group has already thought of variants to allow all players more turns so that more can be accomplished before game's end. A lot to like here though, and always willing to play. Reminds me of Sid Meier's "Pirates!" a lot, only in board game form.

Overall an improvement over other pirate games I've played. The downtime between players and the boring pick-up and deliver aspect of being a merchant were the game's low points. The ship battles were only as engrossing as your imagination allowed. The missions/rumors/specialists added some nice flavor to the game, but seemed more like something you lucked into rather than actively planned for.

RATING: 6
Adventure game done right. Looks awesome. Drips with theme. But if you're scared of randomness, it's not a game for you - lots of important dicerolls and card draws with the potential to make you a winner or kill you. Both victory paths seem to be balanced, but playing with 2 merchants only gets boring quickly.

Pirates in a box. This is the best themed pirate game I have ever played. There is a lot to like here. I really like the resource mechanic and the almost mini-game when you go to sell goods. The rumor cards add some spice and flavor. Combat is inevitable, so try to build ship upgrades and find some crew quickly! The ability to upgrade to many different kinds of ships is amazing as well. So yeah, if you have any interest in pirates at all beyond those lame POTC movies, try this. You will love it!

Yar!  Pirates.  Merchants and Marauders was one of the first games I purchased when I got back into board gaming.  I enjoy the game, its just hard to get to the table due to the length it takes along with it only supporting 4 players when my game group averages 5 or 6 on most game nights.

This was a challenge to learn and took about 3 plays to fully understand how everything works. After we locked down the rules, game plays went by progressively faster. There is never an issue when this game is suggested. The only advice I can give this game is to not let death ruin your mood, it happens occasionally so stay vigilant and stash that cash! Be a trader or a pirate, the choice is yours and you'll have fun trying different things during each play-through.

Played once before returning it.

I really loved what this game was trying to do - the pirate theme was very palpable and the idea of plundering from your fellow players, merchant vessels, and eventually being hunted all seemed like a really good time on paper.

But if someone decided to go to port (which happened often) the game slowed to a crawl, and there's not any real reason for the other players to closely watch or care about what the active player is doing on their turn. Unless maybe they buy a ship upgrade.

OK, quite a nice game, very piratey, but not a lot to distinguish this one from many other pirate games - Plunder for example, or Pirate's Cove.

All the same mechanisms are there, the race to get a bigger or better ship, the large amounts of luck in finding a ship to plunder (and in what you find) or in dodging various navies.

In fact, this one reminds me very closely of plunder in many ways.

So all in all, OK game but nothing new.

RATING: 7
I really love the freedom Merchants and Marauders leaves the players, who are allowed to choose whether they want to be pirates or merchants and then to switch or mix sides anytime: the real challenge though is to win by playing as a pirate, as a merchant’s path to victory is paved with gold. [i](November 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I haven’t played this game for a long time: it looks like it has faded into oblivion with all the gamers I know. Thus, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 8,5 to 7, waiting for the chance to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent game, but it actually took a few plays before I really started to enjoy it.  Fairly easy to pick up, developing your strategy can take a few plays for some as the relationship between your captain, your ship, and your intentions towards being a merchant or a pirate and your intentions towards player vs player interaction can all impact each other somewhat.

Very good for a lighter board game. Not too difficult for a more casual gamer but not too simple for a more hard core gamer.

Very good pirate feel.  Best pirate game I have played.  It's ameritrash, I guess, but has a eurogame feel, as well.  I did not get to play a full game (hence the decimal rating) but I really liked what I had played.  I think there are many possibilities on what would be a winning strategy which would lead to great replay. Looking forward to playing again, soon. 

Update: Got a full game in.  The speed of the game amps up once you get familiar with the process.  It helped that we had someone who had played a few times, as well.  The one thing I liked was even though I was out of it early (I was a pirate and was surrounded by naval vessels who hence gave me a beat down) I still cared about continuing.  My goal became escaping the navies and surviving (which I did).  Just a fun game.

A truly phenomenal game. I love all the different choices one has during the game and that each play is completely different with the variable missions that come out, rumors, events, etc. We find ourselves humming "Yo Ho Ho, a Pirate's Life for me" every time. What a fun game! I want to play this all the time and can't get enough of it.

RATING: 7
An okay pirate game, but I think there is a bit too much luck for my liking... and the pirate and NPC navies can make the game harsh if certain event cards come out together or fail to move these big-bad ships.  The combat takes too long.  That said, I'm anxious to play again to figure out how to play this game more competitively... I just floundered in last place trying to be a trade ship but failing to get cheap goods (3-of-a-kind or better).

Note to self:  you really must play this like Vinci or Small World... just kill off your pirate as soon as things are looking grim... if you're down to 4 safe spaces on the board, nail some merchant ships for a quick glory point or two and let the big-bad navies kill you so you can do it all over again.

This has been a big hit with the kids although it can be brutal when you get attacked and lose your ship. The gameplay is tremendous fun be you merchant or pirate and there are plenty of interesting choices throughout the game. There is a fairly high level of randomness but experience and strategy can help mitigate this. The game looks beautiful with great components. The rulebook was hard to flick through for reference purposes but after a couple of plays you get the rules down and the game flows smoothly. We found that provided players are focused on gaining glory points, the game-length is a reasonably 2 hours or so for 4 players. Games could go longer if players are too timid to go for glory.

This ones borderline a 9 rating for the fun game-play. Randomness and some confusing wording on some cards / edge-cases pull it down a point. I'm thinking about the expansion now...

I did have a fun time playing this despite it's long running length, I just don't think I'd ever go out of my way to play it again.

This has a nice combination where you can both do your thing, though I think it leans a bit towards ameritrash.

RATING: 8
Fairly impressed after one play. Three of us played with myself and one other choosing to start off as Merchants owing to our Captain draw. The third player drew a Captain that looked to make a decent pirate Captain and he showed how viable that route is to victory. He had read up on the game more than either of us and it showed although this was the first play for all of us. He had his victory conditions about the time the game was just getting going for us. Luck was kind to him no doubt but everything he did made sense and it all worked out golden for him. I'd like to play this game some more and am motivated to do so, which is a good sign. Some of what I've read though suggests it might wear out its welcome after you've explored the game some. Some of the doubts involve the complicated combat system which we didn't see at all so that will be important to try out. Time will tell but so far we like this a lot better than either Pirate Cove or Blackbeard...
++++++
Couple of plays in now and I'm really appreciating the game's design. Fairly straight-forward but with interesting subtleties and decision points. The combat system needs to be studied carefully but is solid once you become familiar with it. This has easily become my favorite "pirate-themed" game - much better than the simpler "Pirate's Cove" and miles ahead of "Blackbeard."
++++++
More play and a bit of a pattern seems to be emerging - if you get lucky with trade goods, rumours and/or missions, you may well find yourself within reach of a quick win while others are still trying to upgrade their boats. This has happened to us twice now and the game is suddenly over just as you felt you were getting going. There may be a way to tweak the victory conditions to give the game more of a "mid-phase" but I'm not yet sure (other than just upping the VP requirement) how to go about it...

I wish this game was perfect, but as it is, it can be a slog to get through sometimes, with a lot of downtime and turns that don't really flow well.  Who am I to say that maybe the merchant aspect should've been removed and then you can do so much more with it being focused solely on the pirates.

Very pretty high chrome game that allows players to earn glory by delivering goods in demand, raiding of combat.

The combat can drag a bit and hence I rate it just a bit lower but that doesn't ruin the game, it just can slow it down a bit.

Plays differently each time it hits the table.

Juego de piratas en el que el jugador está a cargo de un capitan y un barco y con ellos tiene que ir haciendo puntos a lo largo de la partida. Los puntos se consiguen completando misiones, confirmando rumores de los que uno se entera en los puertos, haciendo labores comerciales o ganando batallas. Los barcos se pueden mejorar y también entran en juego diversos eventos y barcos NPC. Es un juego de piratas bastante entretenido y completo. Es como un juego de aventuras. Eso sí, tiene una duración considerable. Jugado a 4 jugadores, y creo que debe ser como más luce. Recomendable probar.

The quintessential pirate game! Has an awesome amount of choices and various routes to victory. The components are terrific and the gameplay is fun. DO NOT play with anyone prone to AP as it will make the game drag and will cause your friends to hate it. It is an ameritrash game and has quite a bit of luck involved.

The life of a pirate is tough and the naval ships do not play around. Its probably best to be a merchant for a few turns and purchase a better ship or a few upgrades before starting your life of piracy.

Overall, I really like this game and I think the next time I play I will enjoy it even more!

RATING: 9
Captures the feeling of Sid Meier's C64 classic very well.
I like the different mechanisms for trading, capturing merchantmen and ship fights as well as the story telling in the missions and rumours and the background as a whole. 
However, the game depends rather heavily on the players to add drama and suspense, as it could be played in a rather solitary style, too.
In our games, the best moments were ship fights, that can mostly be avoided by unaggressive players.
At least in the first games, port actions can drag a little, although we tried to keep things going.

Wonderful game. Beautiful board, highly thematic. So many options, and with the NPC´s and the changing political situations, it really gives you the feel that you are part of a bigger world. Different levels of decision making: some will affect only the next two turns, others the rest of the game. The modular expansion allows you to add just the amount of complexity and luck to the game you like. 
The only issue I find is a little too much downtime because of the port actions...

Our first game was approaching 6(?) hours and we called it. I was actually close to winning, with the final glory points within two moves. The game makes sense, with great theme and straightforward gameplay. The fact that we played so long and I'm willing to try it again makes me believe it is a solid gaming experience. I just don't know why it played so long. One of the best thematic games I've played, along with solid balance. Very intuitive. Look forward to playing again. UPDATE: Second game was 4 hours, completed. I don't feel like the rating should go down, as we were not disappointed with the gameplay, and we had a few brief interruptions. I actually appreciate the solid gameplay even more. Very well thought out with the two avenues of approach to victory. This should rise to a classic of its genre, and become recognized as one of the best gaming systems created. UPDATE: After more plays, this game does not (and should not) go as long as I mentioned in earlier posts. Many ways to pick up glory points, efficient use of actions simply shortens play time, and stashing more gold. Solid game play and just a great game! UPDATE: Used official variant in last 3 games to shorten game to just over 2 hours and raised its rating back to original position.

Super thematic and well done pirate game. Fairly balanced - but off course, there is also luck involved (which I don't mind). Combat system takes at bit of getting use to (aka. learning) and can be gruesome in it's punishment of a poor (or very unlucky) captain.
But most importantly - the game is FUN!

Merchants & Marauders does a lot of things right, and can be an engaging experience with the right crowd. And that is the key: this game is more about playing a role and developing a story and less about trying to win in the most efficient way. So while I would not refuse to play M&M, it is low on my request list (there are many other games I'd rather play in that 3-4 hour time slot).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun and entertaining way to spend an evening with friends.  Shipping, sailing and sinking - what else could you want in a pirate game?  And don't fret about all the hub bub about merchants vs marauders - the game's balanced fine, if you're finding one or the other 'too good' it's a matter of adjusting your own tactics to compensate for your opponents choices.  

And therein lies the beauty of the game, between all of the luck based events (event cards, glory cards, cargo cards, dice rolls for combat, rumour cards... you get my point) and the 'open world' style of the game - no tactic is superior as your opponents can always find a way to mess you up if they so choose! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Odiously long for what it offers. Nearly 4 hours to play after 1 hour of explanations.

A lot of down time between your turns that just drags on. Minimal player interaction.

Glorified pickup & deliver if you are playing a merchant.

Ridiculously unbalanced cards (especially Rumour cards) and dice roll mechanics that have no compensation to make this a meaningful strategy game. Gawdawful randomness and luck.

Nears being multiplayer solitaire!

This is all too bad as the game is beautifully themed and chromed.

Join the pirates, they said.
See the world, they said.
I'd rather be merchant...

You wanna be a merchant in the Caribbean? Great. But maybe you want to change your plan and be a pirate? Yeah, you can try that. The bounty on your head is too high, it's too dangerous? Take that quest and get your victory points that way.
Great theme with a flexible game and countless strategies. Sid Meier's Pirates - The Boardgame.
I love it...and I didn't have a problem with the downtime by now.

The problem I had with the game is about the time. Not the down time or the actual play time but the felt play time. I really like to play long games for hours but this one feels way longer than it is. It really get's lengthy pretty quick since you can't do that much on your turn and it's the same all the time.

RATING: 4
Well now, this is a tough one to rate.   I guess I've been spoiled by Sid Meier's Pirates! (the PC game) from which M&M is clearly derived.     The problem is that this game is just so slow and poorly paced compared to the PC game.

Let's start with the components... this is a beautifully constructed game.  Everything is polished and even the relatively lengthy rules are for the mostpart straightforward.

However...

Merchants appear to have a fairly boring existence, effectively playing an Empire Builder mini-game without drawing tracks.   Pirates are a little more interesting, but the balance certainly doesn't favor them.

Downtime is also a bit of a problem in that turns range anywhere between 3 seconds and 5 minutes, as a whole range of port actions are executed.

So, while I can understand that the theme appeals to some people, this feels like an inferior reproduction of a fantastic computer game.  The boardgame really needs a CPU to handle the movement of NPC ships, battle rolls, etc.   So get the computer game!

I'd like to point out that the designer of this game is incredibly helpful to people on the BGG forums.  That alone deserves some credit, and it's nice to see that a designer cares to participate like that.  

Still, this is not a game for me and the people I game with.

A beautiful board and a solidly put together game, but it's just too long and fiddly for our group.   I found the merchant part boring and the pirating part frustrating, as merchants could just jump from port to port each turn to remain safe.

Very enjoyable, with a good balance between merchants and pirates, and a real Age of Piracy feel to it.  The combat rules take some getting used to, and teaching the game takes a bit of time, but you can almost smell the salt air.  Beautiful components, too.

Very fun, if somewhat convoluted game. Once I had the rules down and gameplay wasn't so awfully slow, the game was great - so long as you're a pirate. It's super boring to be a merchant. 

To those of you who say that being a merchant is the easiest way to win: no wonder you hated the game! Your group must not be very competitive, because the real fun lies in raiding your wealthy friends. Just before he was about to win I managed to steal over 70 gold and a galleon from a merchant player, taking all of his cargo (tee hee). I didn't feel too bad, though, because I beat him in my pimped-out sloop. Ha!

The end of the game has always been an anti-climax, where in what feels like the middle of the game someone manages to stash enough coins to tip them over the finish line. The game tempo is very uneven. Sailing and merchant raid turns take a couple of seconds, and then everybody has to stop and wait for five minutes while someone does a port action.

Completely and totally sold on the theme of this game.  The openness on how you decide to proceed for victory is great and combines different styles of game play together in one box.  Only complaint is there seems to be a lot of little fiddly rules that I'm not generally a fan of, but the fun factor and the theme makes up for it in a big way.  This is as about as heavy of a game I prefer, too.

We both liked this feel of this one. Ship combat is somewhat complex to negotiate. Engaging in player to player combat is potentially game ending, so we are careful to do this, but thankfully there are lots of NPC around to get messy with. Along with Clash of Cultures, this was also a birthday present. This was the game we played first, but it was quickly overshadowed by Clash. We need to come back around and play this some more.

Very fun game. I don't think the merchant strategy is favored; it's just more straightforward. As a pirate, you have to go after those wussy traders and steal their shit. That's what pirates do. 

My concerns are that some pirates and/or card draws might really swing the luck one way or another, but really, isn't it all about adventuring on the high seas?

Not for Trade. This game reeks with theme. The board is beautiful, the ship components are cool, and all the artwork on the cards couldn't be better. The only negatives I have for this game are the considerable downtime on a player's turn. There are a host of actions that a player can make that aren't very interactive yet can take 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The other downside is the combat mechanism between ships. It's quite fiddly and difficult to get one's hands around it during the first try. Even after playing 4 games, I still can't seem to get the hang of combat without looking at a help chart.

*7* (Initial plays)
Pretty good sandbox style game. A lot of decisions to be made. This one is tough to get the hang of on the first play because it is so open. It is a race game, the first to 10 pts triggers the end game, but what happens before that can be a vast. Delivering goods, attacking other players, fulfilling missions, solving rumors, all sorts of stuff. The game and a players turn can run a bit too long, especially the combat, so I don't see this seeing lots of play, but it's a good game that will stick around because it's fun to play.

Love this game. I wouldn't pass up a chance to play. The only downside so far is that our play times are more than the suggested estimate. Even with experienced players, we tend to go four or five hours for a 3-player game and often haven't allowed for that much time to play. I still love it and bad planning on our part does not detract from its score.

What I don't quite understand is… after all the remarkable production value put into make nice thick board tokens, coins and map, why did they suddenly cheap out and make ugly plastic ships? Looking for better ship alternatives or maybe painting them.

This is by far the best pirate game I've ever played. When I first read thru the rules I thought my wife wouldn't have the patience to learn and play this. Well I taught her how to play it in 15 minutes, and she loves it.{She is a seasoned gamer, but sometimes doesn't like complex games.} This game is complex, but once learned it is a breeze to play. Sometimes it is the level of detail that makes a game shine, as is the case with this game.

RATING: 6
This seems like a niche game.  If you like to imagine you're sailing the seas as a merchant/marauder, this is probably the game for you.  As for me, I find the game enjoyable, but the rules are slightly too complex and the strategy slightly too little to produce a game that is highly enjoyable for me.  Still, this is a fun game, but it's just not my style.

That said, I think 4 players who are experienced with the game could solve that issue.

RATING: 9
A solid game with plenty of fun for everyone! The game really sucks you into its atmosphere. Playing a pirate is a lot harder than one might expect, but the rewards can be huge if you manage to pull it off. As such, it is quite realistic and deciding which risks are worth taking is key to this game!

The only thing I do not appreciate is the random selection of a captain. If you do not feel confident to play a pirate, you may end up with a pirate captain that has but little advantages to offer to a merchant player. Alternatively, you can just try your luck OR retire your captain, although both could cost you (either money or a turn).

The components are high-quality although the reference sheets are a bit large. Knowing the sea zone advantages by heart really helps, so you tend to become better at this game over time for this reason alone.

amazing theme. nice amount of options to build your Captain/Ship and a variety of ways to win. played a 3-player game and had a blast. interesting enough mechanics to bring out lots of theme but not completely bog it down into bombast. has some down time but not bad enough to be a turn off. 

awesome components.

dice use for some contingency is fine for the scale of this game. not a game breaker at all unless youre a complete snob.

Merchants is a solid game with a cool theme and great components. I picked it up based on the popularity of its solo variant in the 1-Player guild, but unfortunately it just hasn't clicked for me.

I've played it 4 times and each time there's a debate on rules. Very fiddly rules and clunky play each time. Loads of down time, we actually played Ticket to Ride concurrently on an iPad while playing this dog. Randomness abounds. What? you died? you'll just come back as another pirate and start all over again, but keep the victory points of the last pirate. Just as your pirate is gaining momentum. I'll walk the plank before I play this scallywag again.

Takes way too long with too much down time. I see what they were trying to go for and I really think the game has some great mechanics and components but the play time required is more than what I get out of it.

I liked the theme of this game, and the variability of prevailing game conditions and winning strategies. My only problem is that the game was quite long for what it was - and don't think I would add it to my collection as I can't see it getting a lot of table time. 

I think what I learned as well is that changing strategies doesn't really work in this game. My captain was weighted towards the merchant role and seeking out rumours and I should have continued to play to this strength. After failing to roll successfully for rumours more than once (who can't roll a 5 or 6 at least once with four dice!) and then plague closing the ports I needed to offload goods in demand I chose to attempt a pirate strategy. In retrospect I would have been better sticking with the merchant strategy and just sucking up the wasted turns from bad rolls and plague.

Totally unfair rating based on one play, where I didn't totally understand the rules. I'm a slow rules [i]listener[/i], and when coupled with a fast rules [i]explainer[/i] we just end up playing before I really understand everything. There were entire segments of the game that never came up, such as player to player combat, boarding ships, etc. I'm not sure exactly what I missed. But I won a 4p game against two other players who had played before by not doing much. I guess my starting captain was decent (Cartagena dude), which made it fairly easy to just go pick up stuff and drop it off. Entirely uneventful. I didn't use any of my Glory cards. None of my ship improvements (except my main ship replacement) mattered. Never interacted with another player or npc. A little worrisome that this could be the scenario of the winning player. But if I go back and read the rules myself and fully understand everything, I'd be open to a possible improved rating.

My original ameritrash game! I fell in love with this one instantly after first play and loved the hybrid euro elements mixed in with the sandbox/ameritrash feel. The pirate/treasure hunting narrative of the game really appealed to me (and is why I haven't really been interested in Xia). Then we got the expansion and loved it even more! And then...my gaming tastes just outgrew it. After playing other thematic games like War of the Ring and X-Wing, I realized that the mechanics in M&M just didn't hold up. I loved this game for expanding my gaming palette and will always remember my fun plays of it fondly.

I really had high hopes for this game, which were eventually crushed after purchasing M&M a month ago.

There just isn't much going on in this game.  There is literally no reason or encouragement to play the game as a pirate.  In the end, players always resort to picking up cargo at one port and dropping it off at another.

The game is too long for what it is, which unfortunately ends up being dull and boring.

I'm still relatively new to board game collecting, but Merchants and Marauders  has been the biggest disappointment thus far.

As I've only played the game a couple of times, I'm hoping that it will get more interesting with more plays.  However for now, I can't rate this higher than a 4.

Love this game! Had my eye on it for over a year, but hesitated because of the price tag, but glad I finally shelled out the cash.. it's great player interaction, engaging, and it has pirates! Beautiful art, good pieces, and the box is like a brick! Full of great stuff.

Definitely the best pirate game I have played so far, even over Pirates' Cove. If you enjoy pirate-themed games, this one will scratch your itch.. it carries the theme throughout the game, from the ship miniatures you get to move around the Caribbean map board to the stories on mission and rumor cards. Sailing the seas and exploring new ports, scouting and raiding merchant ships for cargo, following rumors, hunting down pirates for bounties and fighting naval ships out to bring you to justice all add to the rousing feel that you are really a pirate captain in the old Caribbean, sailing for gold and glory!

The random element of event, glory, mission, and rumor cards that come out keep the game very interesting, and the dice keep you on the edge of your seat when fighting a naval captain with a faster ship or more cannon. It also gives you a chance at a dramatic victory (think critical hit for role-players out there) when the odds are against you. One very cool aspect of the game is the different captains available to each player, each featuring different stats on their corresponding captain cards - each has a unique ability that gives them an edge over others in certain areas of the game, and some are better suited for pirating while others make better merchants. The only complaint I have in this regard is that some captains are clearly more dominant than others, where they possess greater skill in seamanship, for example, and are therefore guaranteed to be much more successful pirates, as this is the most crucial skill for piracy in the game. There are ways to overcome this discrepancy, however, and the game is still fun despite the fact. The rules tell each player to draw a captain randomly, but we allow each player to choose from two cards, so to give them a bit more control over determining their role in the game. The pirate captain profiles combined with rolling for attacks in battles and "leveling up" your ship gives this game a great role-playing element that will make you feel like you're in an RPG with a unique character to play.

Of course, I should also mention that you can trade your way to victory as well; hence the word "merchants" in the game title. This turns out to be a potentially far more lucrative role in the game, if merchants are left alone by other players who opt toward piracy. This creates a necessity for players to be naturally at odds, which makes the game more exciting, but makes it a little more determined as well: pirate players must attack merchant players, or they will be allowed to amass wealth too easily; yet, all of a player's wealth is transferred to another if he is defeated in battle, so the power differential created can be a problem going forward in the game. As long as you know this going in, and can plan for it, and not get upset at the game or players, you'll be alright.

The major drawback of the game is the downtime between turns - each player typically has a lot to do on his turn, so each other has to wait a while. Our gaming group just passes around multiplayer iPad games during most of our sessions anyway, so there's no downtime for us - problem solved!

If you're looking for rich and robust themed gaming experience with lots of interaction, decision-making, high-stakes chance, and role-playing elements that lasts about 2 hours - and you love pirates - this is definitely your game.

One of the best RPG board games I've played. Ton of fun even with 2 players, thanks to the NPCs, which could bring 6 more players to the game. The beginning is fairly long, mostly due to many rules and options, but on the 2nd game, when the rules are all laid out and everyone knows their game, the gameplay time is about 90 minutes for 2 players (which is more or less average for me). The theme is alluring and fun. The players can switch sides in the middle, and the cutthroat action is awesome.
Highly recommended for 2 players, and my wife and I love it!

RATING: 8.25
This is a game I wanted to love, but ended up just liking quite a bit.

On the plus side, the game does give you a good sense of trading, sailing and pirating in a certain age.  It seems like fun to be a pirate until you realize everyone wants to turn you in!  The game has lots of detail and tries to add atmosphere through the mission and rumor cards.  Great components, with a particularly lovely board.

The real issue here is downtime - with 4 players, AP from one person can make it an eternity until another player needs to pay attention (cue the smartphones being whipped out).  Also we found that until one player decided to go the pirate route, it lacked excitement.

Unlike most games, this time I'm anxious to try it with less players, as I think it might tighten things up and make it more interesting.  But on the whole I'm intrigued and anxious to play it again.

So far this is my perfect pirate game. I hope that more developers will try to make pirate games, but this one does it for me right now. It is long enough though that I have to schedule a special night to play it. When I do though, I bust out the pirate gold that I made for it, and pirate music. It is really fun.

As a fan of Sid Meier's Pirates I just couldn't pass this game and it is really fun game to play.

Ah, the glorious pirates, wonderful world of seafaring, combat and riches. All is built well in the game. From having manage your own ship, finding rumor, trading, and pirating, the theme really evokes well. Unfortunately the gameplay hinders me. See, I like controlled luck, that is, you can modify your rolls or something. There's some degree modification in this game, but not enough to say "controlled". A pity, since other than that, I love the other aspect of the game.

It's got pirates!!! Nuff said.....need more? Fine...it's a boardgame version of Sid Meyer's Pirates(the computer game)...still not enough? Lets see what else....beautiful graphics...the chance to start a career as either a pirate or a wealthy merchant...the chance to prove yourself and become famous...to start from scratch with a boat that barely sails and finish the game sailing a might Galleon or even a Man o War...Raid merchant vessels and steal as much as you can...buy goods and sell them where they are most in demand...sail the seas in search of pray(be it players or NPCs)....try to avoid viscious pirates or Royal Fleets...search for Rumours and proce them true or false...and it's just keeps going :).

I like the game a lot...lots of diversity....the theme is highly appealing...combat is nice and even though its dice based there are ways to mitigate results and I like the fact that you can try to board opponents vessels if yer cannons be shooting blanks or the enemies cannon be bigger than yers :D.

Later Edit: Still a great game but takes a bit too much time and can't really find players for it.

While not without a fair amount of fun, the pick-up-and-deliver gameplay seems a little same-y after a while. Piracy doesn't seem to reward the player enough, or at least it seems to be much more difficult to win as a pirate. Overall, I much prefer Firefly: The Game with some expansions to Merchants & Marauders.

I suspect the people who rate this very highly haven't played it that much or are rating "their" version of the rules.

Read the suggestions for game balance on these forums VERY THOROUGLY before you buy, because quite honestly, if you aren't willing to tweak the rules it is exceptionally broken.

The artwork is beautiful, the overall quality is exceptional, but there are simply way too many balance issues.  Within almost every aspect of the game (ships, missions, rumors, captains, and events) there are just horribly unbalanced cards that break the game and have ruined the fun of every game we've played so far.

I really liked, and enjoyed, the theme in this game!  You really do feel like a merchant, or a pirate (if you choose), when playing this game. The realism comes from playing the rumour, mission, and glory cards.  It is fun to try to fulfill a mission, or venture to see whether a rumour is true (am I lucky enough to roll the influence I need?).  There is a certain push your luck portion to this game (Do I roll the dice to attack one more time?; do I dare pick up another cargo card in a merchant raid?; do I have enough to be successful?). This level of tension, the cool map, and awesome models, make this game fun and worth its adventure.

On the negative side, this game feels like there is a little too much luck (ex. dice rolling, random enemy ship placement, etc.) and the game is just way too long (It took me over 4 hours to play it).  The rules are not the easiest to learn; there are a lot of rules - and combat felt somewhat convoluted.  

On the positive, the game feels fun and I want to play it again! Sadly, I am not sure when I will ever get it back to the table (especially with more than 2 players).

Quintessential board game about being a scoundrel pirate or a wealthy merchant in the Caribbean. Base game feels like it's balanced in favour of being a merchant, but playing as a pirate is a lot more fun. It's always amusing when I introduce people to this game and they want to play as a pirate, but they cop out during the game and start playing as a merchant instead. Speaking of, being able to play this in a freeform style is very appealing. Setup and packing away the contents is a minigame of itself. Expansion fixes balance issues of being a pirate.

This game is awesome :) 

I love the theme and i love being able to do whatever I want and be whoever I want even if that is not the best strategy as my characters skills recommend against. Its scrappy but not a lot of scrapping between players and can be pretty brutal when someone looses their ship.

I'm giving it a 10 because although its not perfect and some people don't get on with it as well as I do its the game which got me hooked on modern board games. I have played it a lot solo and less times with other players as it is a long game and has long player turns so downtime can be an issue. Its also a pain to teach to non gammers.

In a game that's already tight on actions, all the stupid cards that kill an action make an already too long game tortuously tedious.  Dead turns are an obsolete gaming mechanic that should be retired and games with them should be forgotten.

Needs an expansion to mitigate some of the luck, offer the capability to hire better crew (improve odds on die rolls), and something to do during downtime (port blockades, intercepts, and captain vs. captain interaction in port). Then it would shine and players would be very keen on keeping an eye on the board and wipe away some of the downtime. Beautiful presentation. My go-to pickup and deliver as 3 can play in 2 hours.

EDIT 2015: Love the Seas of Glory add on completes the game and adds just the perfect amount of new stuff. The off-turn scouting is great to alleviate downtime! I won't play this game gain without the expansion.

Excellent blend of theme and mechanics. Yes, there is some luck, but good players (those familiar with the rules, cards, etc.) will know how to minimize this. 

The production quality is stellar, and it's great to be able to choose your play style (merchant or pirate), even with the possibility to switch during the game. 

Numerous captains, ships, missions, rumors, and events add variability so that each game is unique. Seems very well balanced, especially with the ability to attack player captains.

Played three times. Did not really enjoy much. Game is very, very long -- particularly for a dice-fest!

The theme is great; the components are great.

The randomness is crippling... you can take credit for very little of your success and you have no real need to take blame for your failures, either. (And it's not just dice randomness, but the cards, too. I don't like winning or losing a 3-4 hour game based almost entirely on getting better cards or better rolls.)

Setup and takedown time are pretty big.

Downtime, a myriad of different rules that frequently aren't all that intuitive...

Too much hype on this one. Wow.

Excellent, medium-light pirate game. Pretty much what [i]Blackbeard[/i] wanted to be but absolutely failed at. This should be your pirate game of choice if you're looking for something in the medium complexity range.

I do think the game could use some variation in terms of how points are scored. Some fan based variants posted here are worthy of consideration, especially the ones that limit how many VP you can score simply by stashing cash.

Also, not all captains are created equal, but a simple house rule of drawing two and picking one usually resolves that.

Merchant & Marauders is a cross between a Euro game and a thematic Ameritrash game where you play the role of a ship captain.  As a ship captain, you can either buy and sell goods as a merchant, or become a pirate (or a combination of the two).

I'm very conflicted about this game.  On the one hand, the high quality components and great core game play make for a very compelling theme with interesting decisions.  But there are a hundred annoying rule exceptions added on top of the core rules that make learning the game a horrendously unpleasant experience.  Many of these fiddly rule exceptions only come into play once every 3 or 4 games, but players are constantly forced to read the exceptions to figure out if they are relevant.  In my first game of M&M, I received 6 Glory cards and 2 Rumor cards, each with 5 - 10 sentences of text.  But after wading through the text, while trying to follow the game play, it became evident that only 2 of the cards could have become relevant to the game play.  In the end, not one of these 8 cards affected game play to ANY extent.  All they did was pull my attention away from the fun game play experience, and waste my time.  Further compounding the problem is that the icons on the cards are not perfectly consistent nor intuitive.

Another one of my complaints is that there are several different types of combat rules that are not consistent.  For instance, there are different rules for fighting a NPC merchant ship and for fighting a player merchant ship.  There are different rules if one of the ships opts to board, and different rules if the combat takes place with a warship instead of an armed pirate ship, etc.

The theme and the core game mechanics get an 8 or a 9.  I REALLY like them.  The fiddly rule exceptions and the other mechanics which are not core (meaning they don't come up very often) get a 2 or a 3.  So in the end, I have rated this game a 5.

An engaging pirate/merchant sandbox like game - very free-form in what course you can take. Simple rule-set and fairly quick moving although the game can probably play quite long with 4.

It's a 'lite' strategy game with lot's of theme but which I suspect requires quite precise play to consistently do well at, although the theme and experience is key to enjoying it.

Slightly concerned that trading to victory is a bit too easy - more plays will tell.

Great components, some great mechanisms, and a great theme. Why the low rating? Horrible downtime. The mechanisms would probably be suited to a different game because this one needs to move more quickly.

My family has been a fan of Days of Wonder Pirate's Cove for years. After researching between this and Black Fleet I can say we made the best choice for a more advanced version, pirate themed game.  This game has everything!  Planning, luck, intense battles, you name it!  We love it!

RATING: 7
Nice game. Seems thematic enough without being overburdened. I like the choice between merchant and marauder and than you can switch if you like (at least from merchant -> marauder). The start up might be a bit slow and the ending a bit too fast but other than that it was an enjoyable experience. Will gladly play again.

This game is everything I want in a game.  Shiny bits, adventure, theme entrenched, awesomeness in a box.  I will play this again and again - it takes place in a living breathing world where nations go to war around you.  Love it!  There is some significant down time in this game, but I don't really care because I like watching other people's choices in outfitting their ships etc.

Rating could rise with subsequent plays.  First game was too frenetic for me and was difficult to enjoy/understand.  We played where players took their turns without waiting for previous player to finish.  This led to me not fully understanding what I could do in the game.  I had no idea what the other players were doing either. I couldn't really watch them take their turns to learn.   The rating was also hurt because we had to skip a lot of the game explanation because one of the players ran out of patience with the rules.  Ironically he was the same fellow who kept interrupting the game explanation for strategy questions.

However, even if I had gotten all the rules and/or could learn the game better from observing others during their turn, it still felt one-dimensional to me.  I was a merchant and I know there was more to the game (fighting) than what I was doing.  But the merchant dimension felt like a very simple pick up and delivery game.  Try to get 3 of a kind, deliver for glory points and accumulate 50 bucks.  Realized after the game, that I could of thrown in a couple of missions/rumors for some extra points.  I think there is more here to like, but until I get an idea of what that may be, I have to leave it at 5...a take it or leave it game.

Players represent a captain running a ship around the Caribbean.  They can be nice and lawful, trying to eek a living from honest merchant trade, or turn pirate and aim for fast wealth.  Lavish, lovely looking game.  Players take turns to take three actions - sail, scout or port.  Sailing is simply moving, but may barge into trouble from the navies of the world.  Scouting is how to find merchants and such.  Port actions involve honest trade, refit and upgrades to your ships.  Nice, playable game that is very reminiscent of Avalon Hill's Blackbeard (about 10 similar mechanics/ideas, but it is a coincidence, apparently).  A four player game, each racing to 10 glory points, is going to take a long time, and the action is interrupted too often by the long port actions of the players, as well as a laborious multi-step combat system.  I can see the appeal, but Avalon Hill's Blackbeard's blindingly fast action/turns, and tense uncertainty, make that game so much more appealing, and it's faster and more historical too.  This one feels like a 15 year old game that missed the flute with modern, interactive game mechanics.  Two plays were enough to convince me.

RATING: 6
Fun, and captures well the feel of Sid Meier's Pirates!, which I love.

Many of the mechanisms (e.g. trading) feel way too light for the game length. Or, alternatively, the game is way too long for its weight. Just not satisfying for such a long play time.

I really hate it when a player is severely weakened by the game, then defeated by another player, who reaps an undue reward. This definitely happens in this game.

RATING: 9
Very innovative Role Playing game that solves many of the problems posed by the Pirating genre - Power up cards and missions give players more opportunity to interact.  
Genuinely allows for *role* play as you you can be a Pirate, hunt Pirates or be an honest trader - or all three at different times!
A shortfall is that the basic games is a bit too long as written, but has definite possibilities for mods and varients.

This game is simply awesome!  If you like theme and immersion and pirates - then this game is for you!  Playing as a Merchant or a Pirate makes no difference - this game is fun as hell either way!  Aaaargh! :arrrh:

M&M works very well solitaire with some very simple adjustments.  Not sure why a solitaire mode is not included in the box.  These game designers and publishers really need to start understanding how important solo rules are!  I knocked my rating a bit because of this.

Regardless, if an official co-op version ever appeared, I would rate this game higher.

After 3 plays (2 x 3 player, 1 x 4 player), this hybrid is certainly a must for any collection.  The only 4 player game I've played, we used the designer endorsed variant of Off-Turn Scouting to ramp up the interaction.  For future games, it will be my preference to always use Off-Turn Scouting.

Is it perfect ... no... but... is it the best Pirate themed game I've played to date?  You bet.

Great Theme, does have a lot of fiddly parts to it especially with combat but I really enjoyed it.  Felt there was enough going on to keep the game interesting.  The only issue I had is there didn't seem to be an incentive to buy the bigger ships as it was better to use the money towards VP's.

12-29-2010 - Initial rating =4.  3 Hours of play time without significantly important decisions throughout.  Additionally there is significant downtime when other players take a port action.

With pirates it is so hard to balance the realism of pirates of long stretches of nothing happening and the romantic side of swashbuckling raids. This is the first game that I think has a good mix by giving players the option to lay low and stick to the law by trading goods or go rogue with the threat of being hunted down by NPC pirate hunters. Then the missions and other elements that gives the game so much character and so many options yet still is accessible. The end game is my only gripe where suddenly someone gets 10 gold stashed away and boom...It's done. Everything up to that point is pure gold though. The definitive pirate game at this point.

An excellent theme and a decent amount of choice to be made, but I cannot correct every turn every time I play this game. When combat happens, it's painful to go over the rules. If this could be turned into a videogame, I'd be all over it, but as a boardgame, the execution is terrible.

2014-04-15 : Too much chrome/little itty-bitty rules that don't matter one iota in the grand scheme of things but which make the game extremely fiddly and slow. Instead of a streamlined game of trade and piracy, players have their noses buried in the cheat sheets all the time. The high randomness prohibits long-term strategies and simple bad luck can make you lose the game. 

If ever there was a game in which the developer needed to cut out 75% of the chrome rules and streamline the remainder, it's this one.

RATING: 6.75
Excellent theming, true to the theme, plenty happening on the board, a game with a definite narrative arc—but also fiddly and REALLY long. Easy to forget whose turn it is and where one is in the turn process. Little player interaction. Can feel like Monopoly on the seas. Necessitates a steep learning curve both for play and for strategy. Almost too much going on. A game you must commit to. I can see the first couple plays with four players going 5-6 hours long. Seriously.

With only one play each of this, Xia and Firefly (typically grouped together as sandbox games) I have to give the edge to Merchants and Mauraders. I prefer how movement works in M&M and I also like the pirate theme. Combat is a little long and clunky, otherwise, a pretty fun game.

A great game that takes a little bit to get at the beginning, especially the combat rules. Once you get the grip to them however, it's very thematic and becomes fun.

One of the more controversial games in my collection, well at least in my game group.  I would call this the game that Blackbeard should have been.  It has all the elements of trading and piracy that people want in a pirate game and it can be played fairly quickly.  Now I would agree that there is definitely a bit of downtime and it might not work for more than two or three players.  I would also agree that it seems too easy for those taking the merchant route to win but I think overall it does a great job of combining a pirate game and a trading game into a single package.  I need to play this game more and see if piracy can be successful. Update: 2015 - Rekindled my interest in this game by taking a look at a solo variant I found online and it works great.  Definitely need to explore that variant more.

La prime partida me gustó. El problema fueron las reglas para mi mucho mas complejas de lo que parecen. Y muy largo. Casi 6 horas la primera partida. Pero el tiempo voló. A mi me gustó y tengo ganas de jugar otra vez.

Segunda Partida: todo mucho mejor.. EL JUEGO ME ENCANTA. LE DOY UN 8.5... la partida duró 3 horas... fue una pasada. Es un JUEGAZO. Lo tenia en "trade" y lo quito, ese juego no lo vendo ni muerto. Es estupendo.

Tercera Partida: Este juego llega a mi Top. Es la puta hostia. Y con la expansión es una MARAVILLA LUDICA. Genial.

Cuarta Partida: Una aventura EPICA. He ganado aplastando Goio, Ricardo y Javier. Una verdadera satisfacción :)

Quinta Partita: ho giocato con l'espansione mettendo un sacco di Moduli - TROPPI. Errori da non fare. Per la prossima togli: i venti e la fedeltà della ciurma. (Sorry por el italiano).

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) A fun, light-hearted romp through the romantic waters of the pirate-infested Carribbean. There is not much strategy involved, with my initial plays suggesting it is more important to react to your current situation than commit time and actions to pursuing any particular plan, potentially creating a feeling that the game is playing you. However, it manages to capture the swashbuckling feeling of pirate mythology quite effectively, and is gorgeous, so I am turning a semi-blind eye to its faults.

Heavily thematic!  The theme alone makes this game terribly fun to play.  The randomness of pirate battles can be a bit frustrating (i.e. dice rolling), but it's anyone's game at sea!  If someone can't decide what to do at port, turns can drag on.. but allowing the next player to start their actions while they decide can move things along.

Some issues with terminology in the rules (i.e. no definition of a 'turn' vs a full round of play, claiming/completing missions).

Theme-rich fun on the Spanish Main.  I like almost everything about this game.  It really gives one the feeling of pursuing a career, making the hard decisions based on the opportunities that arise.

This is a blast.  One of my favourite thematic games.  Don't be put off by the 4-hour run time.  Just choose a bunch of pals who're patient, not too AP-prone, and, ideally, don't mind screwage or life not turning out fair.

I think it's important that people are enjoying the conversation at the table in this game, because it's quite possible someone will be effectively eliminated from the game (by repeated defeat) quite early on, and there are no significant catch-up mechanisms that I'm aware of.    (Alternatively. It won't break the game if that player leaves the table, though it might break your heart).

You can play as aggressively or as independently as you think will fit the group - there's plenty game in either direction.  Lovely and thematic, all the rules make sense, so if your group is forgiving, you can actually have them start immediately, and teach the game during that first play (perhaps with the two advisories that 1) ship upgrades don't regen, and that 2) selling three of the same in-demand cargo is MUCH stronger than selling two).

Very pretty on the table.

I lost my first game by miles, still had great fun!

This opinion is after 2 long, fun games (one was with some modules from Seas of Glory expansion).

It's like there are two games here: the competitive but absolutely boring one (merchants) and the thematic but woefully underpowered one (marauders). Why they are in the same game doesn't make sense. If I wanted to play a pickup and deliver game, there are much better ones, otherwise there's no point to playing this as a pirate. I have so many problems with this one, but, frankly, it's not worth my time to explain. Suffice it to say I find the economy, costs, and ships to be imbalanced, and the gameplay itself devoid of interesting enough decision to warrant the lengthy rules explanation required and the long turns. I played with 3P and can't imagine how interminable it must seem with more.

The best pirate game on the market at the moment - a thematic one, and it looks good! I like the idea that you can choose your role as a good merchant or a bad pirate. Lot of cards, every captain and sea area has its special ability of its own, players can fight against NPC ships and other players... Good game for 2 or 3 players (haven't played a 4 players' game yet - maybe a little bit too much downtime?). I almost gave 9 to this game.

Scratches some of that Sid Meir's Pirates! sandbox itch.  It's pretty fun, but requires a chunk of time that we don't always have.  The Seas of Glory expansion helps a lot with being a pirate.

This game also feels like it has all the right components, but it doesn't quite come together to completely deliver on the potential of the theme.  If you find the right combinations of variants (and there are a lot!) it probably makes a better sandbox game.

Pick-up-and-deliver games are a favorite genre of mine. Combine that with pirates and the huge amount of theme that comes through completing missions, investigating rumors, and flipping over events, and you have a very fun game. The sea zones themselves are wildly imbalanced, yet this leads to competition with a full complement of players that squares with the theme. Complaints about the clunky ship-to-ship combat outside of merchant raids are warranted. Not deep but a helluva lot of fun with the right folks.

This game is the best pirate game out there. The expansion makes it even better. There is a lot going on--it is pretty heavy. But there are so many options to choose from, which I like. My only complaint is that it is sometimes too easy to merchant instead of maraud. You have to be really, really aggressive to win as a pirate if the other players poke around too much. The expansion helps a little, though, by adding an extra NPC pirate.

Thematic, but boring. The worst kind of luck, where you can't do anything about it; so many events are basically "skip a turn." The most interesting bit, the ship combat,  is the most tedious. Game is easier for traders, but trading turns take forever, and there are better games about trading.

Props for a lovely board, but the search for an interesting pirate board game goes on.

Rating after two plays, which have been very different because of the captains and cards drawn. This game has lots of theme and atmosphere with some luck from the cards and dice.  In the right mood and with the right people then my wanting to play score is going to be in the 9-10 range: with the wrong people on the wrong day then I'll be looking to pass over this in favour of something with more control.

Thematically this game is an ace in the whole, and reminds me a lot of the Sid Meier's Pirates! video game series, except its you instead of the game that is keeping track of your stats, reputation, and other important information.  The amount of things you can do is really incredible, and a little intimating, though I respect and enjoy the amount of freedom each player is given to figure out how to succeed in their chosen profession, and ultimately achieve victory.  However, some of the gameplay elements don't seem very fleshed out, and there can be a LOT of downtime between players, with little to do except plan your next move.  The game probably needs some tweaking and house rules to get the most out of it, and the right group of people.  Highly recommended for people who love the theme, or thematic games at all.

The theme is carried out exceedingly well and pleasingly accurate.  For instance, combat is complicated but unique, involving maneuvering of the ships, combat shots, boarding followed by crew combat.  

Components: Excellent plastic ships and large, two-sided player aids (rules says 2 included, but my box had 4). Massive text on cards. Good player boards and very large treasure chests.  The rules are well written and not difficult (battle being the most complicated), but it took me hours to go over the rules because there are so many facets to remember, and forgetting one thing could greatly change the play of the game.  Once play started, I was pleased how everything fell into place. 

You can modify ships in numerous ways, upgrade to bigger ships, repair ships, move on the sea or into ports, modify combat, go on missions, prove rumors, buy and sell goods, increase your crew, add specialists, attack or raid, place gold in a safe treasure chest, and more--hence the extended rule reading.

Because conflicts enhance the game, playing with the full 4 players is more alluring to me, because engagements increase.  There are several avenues to gaining Glory Points and winning the game, one of which is through combat, but if only rare or occasional combat occurs, the game seems rather bland.  The game has some built in potential conflict through non-player pirates and navies, that are moved around the board in a unique way.   So even if players don't attack, limited battles should occur anyway, especially as the game progresses and the number of non-player ships enter the board. 

This is the most satisfying pirate game I have played.  The reason it didn't get higher than a 6, is because I will have to spend an hour or more reviewing the rules before each play or play it often, either of which is hard to do with a game that then lasts 3 hours and needs four to play.

Beautifully produced, but I am still undecided as to the different ways of winning at this game.  Both games I have tried focused around Merchants simply hoarding and building up glory through 3 desired goods trades.  I tried my hand at being a pirate but once the Naval ships start roaming all possible corners of the sea, you are extrememly limited in options.  It seems this game has two reliable paths to victory: a blitz pirate victory before the big ships come out, or a drawn-out merchant victory which is principally based around drawing the right kind of goods for the closest ports.  Both games I played saw a victory through the latter option.

I will play again and probably try my hand at being a pirate but that depends on the starting captain.  So my choice will also be based on a random draw...

All 4 players were new to the game.  Took a little while to get going with learning the rules, but after the first few initial rounds things started rolling.  Future plays will go a lot faster since we know what we're doing.

The winner ended up being the guy that used his captain's skill the best and did a lot of Missions/Rumors with a little merchant trading thrown in.  The rest of us tried our hand at piracy but came up short.

Everyone agreed that it was a great game and would play it again.

After a second play, I really like this game.  Key, though, is that you can't play nice and need to go after other players, otherwise you'll have someone stash 50 gold and win.

I would always play with the house rule that you cannot collect more than 2 or 3 Glory points from stashed gold since that stashed gold almost always makes up half the winning pirates gold.

If there are any problems with it, it's the combat rules where you're rolling dice and depending on what each player decided to do only some dice are used and you can't run if the other player tried to board, etc.  It needed a whole flowchart.

2/2017 - had to bump this out of a 10 slot as I haven't played it recently and it is difficult to get to the table.

The only flaw with this game as far as I can tell is PvP combat is WAY more complicated than it should be.  I've seen workflow charts of combat cover entire pages.  Other than that, this is a very fun pirate and port trading game.  The closest thing I've seen to Sid Meier's Pirates in a board game.

Nagyon-nagyon vártam, hogy végre játszhassak vele, de sajnos csalódás volt az első játék. A sok bonyolult szabály, még nem lenne gond, de a játék végén is vontatott volt a játékmenet, mikor pedig már mindenki belejött. Voltak dolgok, amik nem álltak teljesen össze koncepcionálisan. A legnagyobb kérdés az, hogy mi értelme van a fregattnak? Probléma még, hogy túl kevés az npc és túl keveset mozognak, így nincs sok félnivalója a kalózoknak.

Bízom benne, hogy egy második játékkal összeáll majd a kép, de vannak félelmein. Nomeg iszonyat nehéz hozzá partnereket találni.

Pirates in the Caribbean! The success of a game like this hinges on theme integration. The mechanics are solid, although players need to deal with a fair share of randomness but where the game really shines is thematic density.

The transfer of the Golden Age of Piracy to the table works pretty well. Many of the usual pirate clichés translate directly to game elements. The biggest issues with the game are downtime and the low player interaction. Other players are the only real threat to players (NPC naval ships and pirates can be tough but are usually easily avoided; NPC merchant vessels are (too) easy prey) no matter if they earn their money as traders or pirates but the incentives to actually attack other players are pretty much non-existent. In most cases, the odds are roughly 50:50 so you'd much rather plunder another helpless merchant or seal another glorious trade instead.

Mechanically, the game is pretty uninspired. Neither the merchants nor the pirates have particuoarly tough decisions to make, and drawing the right cards or rolling successes at the right moment go a long way to victory.

Eurogame with traces of Ameritrash elements -lots of card events and reactions, tons of dice rolls, updating player ships... A lot of theme here. 

All in all it works great but you must take the game as it is, if you like pure euro-planning strategies or combat games it won't be for you. 

2 players game becomes dull. 4 players is great but maybe a bit long for some folks, between 3 and 4 hours.

It's a gorgeous game that is entirely about creating a pirate story. It is thematically brilliant, albeit complicated, but the stories leave me unsatisfied, ultimately. There is an obscenely high risk to reward correlation. I don't mind this normally, but being a contendor ultimately can come down to a single die roll (or a terrible global event card). If someone goes for that goal, they can either put themselves in a near untouchable place (requiring higher risks on the parts of other players to catch up), or remove them as a serious comeptitor in the game. As a story telling mechanism, this game is fabulous and requires very little imagination to immerse yourself. If you play this game with the primary intention of winning, however, walk away. It is too easy to crash on the shore and get torn to pieces just based on the roll of the dice.

I love pirates! Probably no theme excites me more than pirates. So I thought this game would be IT, as many had said it is the best pirate game. I was a bit disappointed after our first game, especially when you get the feeling that the best strategy to win the game, is not being a pirate..

This game seems to be a bit unbalanced in favor of the merchants (at least with 2 players, with more players, more ships to be plundered), which is in my opinion not as exciting to play as the pirate side. Also there is quite some down time in a turn, since there is so much to do.

The game is still a lot of fun, because there is so much going on and there are so many choices, but I don't feel this is the ultimate pirate game.

M&M is an amazing game and does a nice job of balancing mechanics and theme.  The theme is wonderfully realized and the mechanics have just enough strategy and luck in them to not get too much in the way of the theme.  Yes, there are some events that can heavily flip a player's advantage and some things can come down to lucky dice rolls and chance card pulls, but the theme is mostly served by these design choices. Most times with games likes these I feel the mechanics suffer to prop up the theme. This simply isn't the case for M&M, where you feel at the very least at the helm of any randomness. This is largely due to a tightly constructed game system and enough moving parts that allow you to manipulate the luck to some advantage. I put this game in the top category of theme-heavy games. This is how it should be done.  Unfortunately, it's a chore and headache to teach and the theme can get buried in some muddy design. It is hard to find a first-time player who doesn't get buried under the sandbox style of the game. Also, it's difficult to even play this game casually and only getting to play this game once a year or so I feel robs me of an experience where the game should really flow.  And there's no denying that the buying and selling of goods is the most boring part of the game and it's a pretty significant part (for a merchant, anyway). Overall, I'm impressed in this games design and approach and it deserves the praise it gets, even if it's got a couple of ugly (but mostly unavoidable) warts.

An enjoyable game that plays fairly quickly and really captures that sense of adventure on the high seas. It does seem to be overly luck dependent though. I find the game ends a little prematurely with whoever got lucky early usually ending up on top. A longer game might give the luck swings a chance to balance out. A fun game though, no doubt.

Best Pirate themed game. This beats other pickup and deliver games hands down, in particular- Firefly (boring unless you're a fan of the series), and Xia (80's style dice rolling for everything idiocy). This provides a thoroughly submerging, 'piratey' experience, from purchasing & refitting ships, navigating waters in order to plunder merchants, engaging in goods trading, and battling with others while staying clear of national ships sure to hunt you down! Great fun.

So far, this is the best pirate-based boardgame that I have played.  There are a few nods to Blackbeard which I still love.  This version seems to flow a bit quicker but still contains a lot of substance for the players.  I may need more plays yet, but being strictly a merchant seems very difficult.  The game almost forces you to be a pirate.  Then again, that it is not necesarily a bad thing.  UPDATE: Have been playing exclusively as a Merchant.  It is not as difficult as it seems and have won many games this way.

Feels like an open game, which is nice.  We ended up being more Merchant than Marauder which makes this game only ok for us.  It doesn't really shine with two people who aren't trying to make the other walk the plank!  Lol
I gave it a decent mark because the theme and components are great and the game is very good even though it doesn't fit our play style.

Brand new and needing one we can like in return!

Definitely one of the MOST thematic games I have ever played. It is literally Sid Meier's Pirates as a boardgame, done PERFECTLY, absolute blast! One of the pirates won but it was surprisingly balanced between the merchants and pirates, can't wait to try the expansion which add a little more PvP, the was very little PvP in our game, most pirate/merchant deaths where because of PvE. Fortunately the enemy is controlled by another player so that felt like PvP! Its a good feeling to sink a buddy's ship and cut of his head!

I haven't finished either of the two games I've attempted, so the final verdict is still out. I have enjoyed it so far. The pirate ship battles are exciting. I'm sorry if you don't like rolling dice, but the chance involved make perfect sense when you're talking about clunky cannons launching balls across bows. But yeah, this is probably a weekend rather than an evening game.

An ameritrash open ended pirate game. Some fun if you just want to cruise around and see what the tide may wash your way. My first game took way too long and we had to call it, which was sad considering it doesn't seem like a game that should take long. I wouldn't play the game with AP prone people as your turn can take 3 seconds and other people could take 5-10 mins to resolve their actions. Would try it again if in the right mood, an enjoyable game none the less as long as you are not expecting a purely strategic game...but why would you with pirates anyway.

RATING: 8
This game seems to be complicated.  But if you think about the theme, the activities associated with the different actions are logical and obvious. So far, no Pirate has won in my games nor in games that club members have told me about.  One member has proposed that all players start as Pirates.  Interested to see how this will play.

I got a chance to play Xia at a con and bought this to try to satisfy that itch. I love the wide-open sandbox feel and the very rich and engrossing theme. I adore any game where I can get lost for a few hours in another world, not just playing a game, but inhabiting that world, sailing slowly from one port to another, having encounters along the way, sometimes getting into fights, sometimes just carrying out a mundane job. Love this game. With more plays, it has the potential to be a favorite. Haven't quite internalized the complex rules yet.

I would have loved this game (Who do not want to be a pirate?), but there is too much downtime for the other players, if a player takes his turn. In addition there is a permanent dice rolling (actions, battle) and a battle system that is too complex. All of them together leaving a bad taste. What a pity!

RATING: 5
Ameritheme at its height.  Gameplay is limited as decision making, particularly for the merchants is very low.  Not quite player elimination but getting sacked and losing 35 gold is pretty much game over.  At least it should then end soon.  Over-hyped.  Feels a bit like a re-make of Blackbeard.

Opinion: this is a good piracy game, you can go as pirate or as a merchant, that is good. You can enjoy both sides but the battles do not go very smoothly and you have the feeling that the merchant has it easier. Will play the game if I have it in front of me, but do not see the need to have it in my shelves.

If you had the fortune to play Sid Meier's Pirates back in the days of the Commodore '64, then this game will recreate that experience for you, but with 3 OTHER PLAYERS!
This game has experienced more repeat "table time" after purchase than any other game I own (except Dominion.)
The theme works very well, especially if you are willing to "go pirate" enough to attack your friends. 
And you should. I mean it. 
Go full-on Pirate.
I'll explain in a moment.

The game slowly introduces new elements and becomes more complex as you play, and EVERY CHOICE can lead to victory or demise. 
The only complaints I have with the game are: experienced players have a HUGE advantage over new ones, and once someone gets in the lead, they are very hard to catch. 
A caveat here though- that's the idea.
 
If some fancy-pants merchant starts burning up the glory track to victory, you and your fellow marauders should TAKE HIM DOWN!
The game wants you to fight each other, and you should, otherwise it gets unbalanced quickly. Once you get past your timid nature and start blasting each other right in the timbers, things get more even-keeled.

This game has great theme, great components (even though the ships beg for a nice paint job), and it gets pirates, and the changing winds of fortune on the Caribbean absolutely right.
My only other mild criticism is that the end-game can be anti-climatic, but that's only because you haven't been paying attention to your opponents. They will sneak up on you and win while you're just getting started. Even more reason to keep a broadside ready.

WARNING- don't play with angry gamers, spouses, and or close family members who can't take a proper beating now and again. When someone takes your ship, crew, cargo, upgrades, glory cards, kills your captain and leaves you with NOTHING but a starting vessel and a new character with only 10 gold to spend- it's going to get ugly.
Forget victory.
You'll be plotting REVENGE.

Certainly the best pirate game I've played, and it gets more right than wrong. It's handsomely produced, fun to play, and seems broadly accurate within historical standards. But I found the conclusion anti-climatic, and while I played a merchant the whole time I sympathized with the pirate players, who found it very difficult to bring their merchant opponents to battle. It also seemed far too easy to win as a merchant -- selling big sets earns lots of glory (a glory point for a set of three in a demand port, plus it earns you eighteen gold, which is practically enough to purchase two more glory at game's end). Should you really be able to secure nearly a third of the victory points required for a win by selling a big boatload of bananas? Yes, there is a cap on how much glory you can earn through stashing gold, and yes you have to get back to your home port to make that stash ... but I was still able to win in a walk by sailing around the eastern end of the map, assembling four big scores, and buying a ship. It was pleasant enough and I like the theme and so would play again if asked -- a good game but short of great.

Played once and that was a few years ago. I remember it feeling more complicated than a pirate game should feel. It is complex enough that the first game is really just a learning experience. If I am taking 3 hours of my time to muddle through a first play of a game I'd like to come away from the experience with the will to get the game back on the table within a month and the desire just was not there. If the game owner had been enthusiastic for a re-run I certainly would have gone for it at the time (and I would almost certainly rate the game far higher, there was enough substance to reward repeat plays) but I just don't fancy going through the learning game again now I have forgot how it plays.

Fantastic flavour. Multiple strategies to win. You can come back after you die (if you take a risk or two). New players can get respectable scores just trading and doing the odd mission/rumour. Rules are fairly intuitive. If you are playing against new players, don't attack them, instead make your mission attaining a Man'O'War !!

Many small rules to keep track of with this one. A few plays should iron this out quickly, but it does make for a long game the first couple of times out.

I very much enjoy the level of detail this game has. Enough to make you become involved without overdoing it in any single area.

The ability to choose your path to victory is great, wide open.

This game is slipping away quickly...the last couple of plays have been VERY disappointing.

A really great, open sandbox of a game where you may sail the seas as a respectable merchant seaman or plunder the waves as a pirate. Significantly, each path has unique aspects, yet are equally viable for success.

It runs a little long for my tastes (sweet spot is probably three players), but you're having so much fun and creating a strong narrative that it never feels as long as it is.

Not as good as I would have hoped.  Too locked into a path determined by the pirate you draw.  No way to improve your skills so your locked into a certain role (Pirate, Merchant, or Quester) from the start of the game.  Too few ships,(only 4) really just a pirate and a merchant ship in two sizes big, or small.  All Ships move the same speed, too slow. Attacking a merchant is a boring exercise with no drama or interesting decisions.  Just draw cards and hope you get lucky.  Same with trading, just drawing cards and hoping for the best.  Rolling for rumors and missions can be brutal.  Miss the roll and you have to take 3 more actions,(That's a whole turn)to take another roll.  Not enough interaction with the Non player ships, they hardly ever move.  Combat system is ok, but convoluted.  Boarding actions are just a dice fest.  All said an average game at best.  Long down times, and little interaction.  Just not allot of game there.  It's too bad, I wanted to like it.  But sadly I prefer Pirates cove, which is also only an ok game.  Where or Where is the pirate board game as good as Sid Meier's Pirates?  It's still waiting to be made.

First impression - Though the explanation took a while just to get the game started, I think it was worth it.  my SO and i had a great time with this one, even though she trounced me hard by attacking me when I was carrying a pile of gold on my way back home.  I can't wait to try this one out again and try out some new approaches.
---
Today was a very unfun Merchants & Marauders day.  Played a couple games that we didn't even finish due to frustration.  If the dice are against you, or if the cargo cards hate you in merchant raids, your chances as a pirate are grim.  Also, merchant players fell victim to roaming pirates so easily, that after  more than 2 hours of play, i still had no glory points.  No stashed gold.  My opponent was then on to his 4th captain and had 2 glory points.  It was fun for a while, despite the misfortune, but eventually it just got too painful.  Rating dropped 2 points.
---
Another 3 player game and my hope for this game is not completely lost.  There are aspects to it that I find very fun and exciting, but there are so many details that need managing, that it's hard to just sit back and enjoy the game!  The play time is just a little too long to get this to the table often enough to make the rules second nature and as a result, I have yet to play this game correctly.  D'oh!

So far this game has only hit the table once. I was really looking forward to playing this game and it was a bit of a let down. However, I will reserve judgement until I can get a couple more plays in. Might be hard to convince my play group though, as it left a bad taste in our mouths (the combat was long, and punishing and the win conditions felt hollow). But I love the pirate theme, and will definitely try again, and be back to update this post.
Update - after second play with new people (1.5 hr set up and explanation, 3.5 hr play with one food break), I can say that I do like this game. I just don't like it that much. It is interesting, because it manages to maintain a moderate level of fun throughout the entire play, but never produces memorable highs. That's a shame, because there is a lot of game in here, and possibly even more theme (I love theme!). The mechanics make sense, but they are clunky. Combat is never as satisfying as it should be (even when I manged to board an opponent and wipe the deck with his crew after being attacked and having my ship mangled, I still felt pretty meh).  The will I, won't I of whether or not to stack a bounty on your captain is one of the best features of the game, but doesn't last. Other than that, the missions and rumors spice things up but don't play into the game enough and are a little shallow. It is a fun game that will probably rarely see play, due to the long time investment and relatively low pay out. Hardly a sound investment on the high seas.

This game has awesome components (except for the boats which look cool but are not as nice as the other components) and really makes you feel like you are gallivanting in the Caribbean sea. Battles come down to die rolls, but you can mitigate chance somewhat.  However people that do not like leaving their lives in the hands of lady luck should stay away.  My one friend punched himself in the head after losing his Galleon to another badly damaged Galleon.  Yeah, he punched himself in his fricken head.  Maybe I'll do a session report to explain how ridiculous this was. 2 days later he said he wanted to play again.

The game absolutely HATED me. The draws weren't getting any good cards the rolls were worst. My captain died. If should be easier to get away from a pirate if you have a 0 chance of doing anything. After about 5 turns of NOTHING I finally got a load only to be jump by a pirate and I'll I could do was go through the painful exercise of rolling meaningless dice for the forgone conclusion that I was going to lose everything and have to start over.

I ended the game with 0 points.

It just seemed weighted against a 'merchant' strategy.  And I guess it's Merchants AND Marauders not Merchants OR Marauders and there is very little reason to even try early game merchanting.

„A Karib-tenger vándorai”
A Libertalia társas mellett ez a gém biztosan felkelti a kedves kalóz-érzelmű játékosok figyelmét, amelyet egy játék erejéig ki is tudtam próbálni. Mivel a szabálykönyv több órás elfoglaltságot ígér és a beltartalom sem kevés, egy 3 fős játék alatt csak részlegesen tudtam a „vitorlaháztető” alá bekukkantani.
A külalak tetszetős, beltartalom minőségi és erősen nyelvfüggő.
A játékban a Karib-tenger egyik kapitányaként mi szeretnék a környék leghíresebb tengerjárói lenni. Alapvetően kereskedéssel és/vagy kalózkodással, vagy inkább más nemzetek vagonjának újraelosztásával törekszünk hírnevet szerezni.
Kezdetben kis hajónkkal, „megbízható” legénységünkkel és feltörekvő álmainkkal keressük kenyerünket, amíg szert nem teszünk jobb és jobb hajókra és vérszemet kapva már nagy tételben játsszuk a partit.
Amit az ember egy kalóz történetből megismer, mind-mind visszaköszön a játékban: trópusi helyszínek, viharok, hurrikánok, hatalmas csatahajók, idegen kalózok, vérdíj, tengeri csata, fosztogatás, kereskedés, híresztelések, „tuti” küldetések, kincsesládánk feltöltése, árulás, … A témában hiba nincs, beszippantja az embert, ha az hagyja magát.
A kártyák mellett halálfejes kockákkal kísértjük szerencsénket, így ezzel is számolnod kell, ha ezen játék mellé szeretnél leülni.
Alapvetően minden körben egy-egy esemény történik, majd a játékosok sorrendben végrehajtják 3 akciójukat és újabb kör következik. Bárki körében bejelentheti, hogy elérte a 10 győzelmi pontot és azzal meg is nyeri a játékot.
A pozitív oldal mellett számomra legnagyobb csalódást a nagy holtidő jelentette, amíg egy-egy játékos végrehajtja körét. Persze ezt lehet csökkenteni, de egyfajta szenvedést jelentett menet közben (mi lehet 4 játékosnál, ha már 3-nál is fárasztó). Bár a partinkban nem történt meg, de egy-egy kapitány más játékos általi kiiktatása a játék közepétől megpecsételheti annak sorsát, győzni már nem fog, marad a bosszú.
Hogy a címből eredően melyik „életvitel” jobb? Kereskedni, kalózkodni, vagy a kettőt kombinálni? Erre nem tudtam rájönni, de egy ilyen játékban inkább hajlik az ember, hogy felhúzza a fekete lobogót, mint, hogy becsületes kereskedő legyen.

This is the first game I've played where I have thought, if I had done this, I would've done so many things just a little differently to make it fun. If I'd been in the play test group, man, this would've been a blinder!

RATING: 8
Horrible. Every victory point is randomly scored. Did you draw 3 of a kind? Then you will score 2 VP almost 3 VP. Did you randomly draw a captain with a high influence? Then you will undoubtedly score several points from rumors. 

Did you draw a captain with only 1 inluence? then you won't be completeing many rumors or missions. Did you fail to draw 3 of a kind? No VP for you.While your opponents are racking up VP, gold and glory cards for randomly drawing cargo cards and/or randomly drawing a captain with a high influence, you could be stuck with a captain with a low influence and poor cargo draws. This snowballs into your opponents getting sexier ships so they can defeat most ships on the seas while you are still in your flute or sloop. 

I am undecided as to whether this game is broken.

[b]Update[/b]: I've stuck with the game. And I've come to enjoy the game for what it is.

[b]Update:[/b] There was a lot of subtlety in the game that was missed on me during my first several plays. With the expansion, this game is easily a 9. Once you work out the kinks, the base game is an 8.

Absolutely cr@p.

If you like games that are dominated by randomness in every way then you'll like this one!

You can play as a merchant (random card drawing and very dull), or as a marauder (dice rolling and very dull).

Me, I'd rather walk the plank than play this steamer again.

The theme is fantastic and it's what saves this game for me. However the game-play drags / becomes repetitive (particularly with more players), and the sea battles tend to be lengthy, unattractive affairs best avoided. I seem to enjoy this more as a two-player game, but it does become largely solitaire play on a shared map in which each player simply engrosses themselves in the seafaring theme.

The most anticipated game we've ever bought. Theme is awesome. Initial playthrough had some highs and lows. Rules are confusing. Game needs more balance. Hopefully house rules can correct the flaws. Ships are going to look amazing when painted. Rating may change after a few more plays.

Ok but underdeveloped pirate game.  Pick up and deliver is a better strategy than actual pirating.  Our game was decided by the card and chit draws.

I was underwhelmed - I love pirate games, and was hoping to find a lighter one than Blackbeard that scratched the same itch.  Instead I find one that is shorter, but has all the downtime problems of blackbeard, without delivering nearly the level of depth or interesting decisions.  

A decent game, but not what I was hoping for.

For anyone who loved the thematic richness of Blackbeard but could not overcome its fiddly-ness, and who is dissatisfied with so many other games with pasted-on pirate theme, M&M is a boon. Though not without its flaws, it is probably the best all-round pirate game to date.

Attacking NP merchant ships is inventive and streamlined. Attacking another player is likewise inventive, but much more fiddly. Also, success seems to favor the pursuit of mercantilism over piracy. (And, boy, do I wish I could sack ports!)

RATING: 6
This game scratches several itches for me.  It has a very nice pick-up-and-deliver mechanic and combat.  The nice part is that you don't have to be confrontational to your spouse/partner in a 2P game since the non-player controlled ships can be attacked and will attack you.  The first game of this was a bit hard to get through because of the rules and some fiddliness, but this greatly improved on later plays.  I've played 5 times now with 2 and 3 players and it works very well.  

After a few more plays, I've downgraded this down to a 7.  I'm not sure if I like this as much with 2P.

Every once and a while I get a strong urge to play this game, but it usually lets down in some small way.  Really fun game that could have been better.
 
Edit: My wife and I have been playing this two player a lot lately and have been loving it!  This is really a hardcore gamer's game.  The euro style restrictions that are placed on you make this a really strategic game and can be hard for 4 players or players who are not heavily involved.  The length also, the events even put a damper on the flow of the game....but, I love this game now with 2 or 3 players who are really paying attention to the nuances and the tension that is the player interaction.  

Edit: now my favorite solo game

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating after my first game.

Nice thematic feel but the game seems clearly unbalanced in favour of the merchants as they can easily win VP after VP just by trading goods from one port to another without being ever intercepted by the pirates.

OTOH, randomness can truly kill the pirates game if the scouting dice are not gentle or some overwhelming glory cards fall in the merchants hands (i.e. Escort).

All in all, the game has got good potential but it seems underdeveloped. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

UPDATE: The game drastically improves with the optional rule for ship interception that makes the merchants' life much harder.

However, I still find some design decisions kind of disappointing. For example, frigates are clearly underpowered when compared with galleons. And the merchant raids are way too abstract and boring. 

Last but not least, it clearly suffers from the smack-the-leader syndrome of many other multiplayer games and can easily evolve into an endless series of battles between players (since the combat winner usually comes out pretty weakened and so becomes an easy prey for the rest).

All in all this is a fun game but there's too much randomness and abstraction for my taste.

RATING: 8.5
Yes, I'm a sucker for theme. And there is no other pirate game (to me) that comes remotely near this one in terms of fulfilling the expectations I have when it comes to piracy.

I like the fact that you are playing against other players but at the same time you are playing against the board. The little treasure chests seem silly but I also like the "hidden treasure" idea so I'll let it slide.

The board is nice looking but does get a little busy after awhile. A few of the spaces could be bigger but that's really my only complaint. 

I like being able to play merchant trader or pirate and the option to upgrade your ship is mighty fun.

RATING: 6
Despite numerous warnings by the designer himself, this game is not an overblown dice fest; it's decent ameritrash, ie with a decent, coherent and not uselessly convoluted rules, and it does not drag for hours and hours, three hours being a perfectly honest figure.

That being said, I found it a little "meh".
Too much downtime, too much stuff based on luck, and too much poor wording.

RATING: N/A
I had been waiting for this one for some time, having read the rules and pre-ordered several years ago.  I was very happy to see this finally in print.

Z-Man made an excellent job with the components, the ship miniatures are GREAT, and the plastic used is perfect (not too soft, not too brittle, and can be painted!).

This game is brimming with theme, and although I dislike PvP (Player versus Player), it is well done in this game, and doesn't take you out of the running if you lose a fight.

Combat is very thematic, and can be a little long for some, but I find it just right, and enjoy watching the combat unfold.  It can become hilarious to watch two crews going at it in hand to hand combat, or two derelict ships (masts reduced to 0) firing at one another until one of them sinks.

The privateering works well, with the bounty and pirate hunters adding some angst.  It may even be worthwhile for other players to hunt you!!  So you better have some special weapons and/or ship upgrades, or it could be a close fight!

Overall feel reminds me of Sid Meier's Pirates!

Game may appear to be long for some, as there are many rules to follow, but they are all intuitive.  Most if not all questions can be answered with the rules booklet, which is nicely done, and the 4 double sided player aids help too!  Thanks Z-Man!

And no need to worry about replayability, as there are hundreds of cards in this one, and the only deck you will normally go through is the cargo deck.

The only negative side thing I can find was with the counters, which were a tad difficult to punch out.

Components are really great, theme is great.. but somehow this game falls flat.

One reason might be the considerable downtime for other players. Because especially the port actions take a lot of time & everyone has to wait until all that selling, buying, repairing, recruiting, fitting, listening for rumors etc. is finished & maybe the player can squeeze a fight in there to.. that means all other players might have to wait 10 minutes for just one player to finish his turn!

The battles are very lucky & worse, don't really invoke a swashbuckling feeling.

I don't know, not my kind of a game..
But if you like ameritrashy family games with a lot of chrome & don't mind a 3-4 hour game, try it.

The Pirate's game of pirate games. Neat concepts and fun. Way too long, but mostly fun still. Only part I don't like is the lethality of it. You can be careful and build up and still get taken out in 5 minutes due to something random (and I like randomness, but not where it's so lethal after you invest a lot of time in the game). Mostly good times though.

This game is just so much fun, and really brings the excitement of sailing the high seas to life. There are so many different ways to get glory points, and it's a lot of fun trying them all. Very immersive game, which I love. There are a fair amount of rules, but they tend to make sense with the theme, so aren't hard to remember. Combat is probably the trickiest. There is also a downtime issue when it's not your turn because of the variety of options to do while in port. Not a huge issue for me though, especially since almost all of my plays have been two-player games with my husband.

Excellent quality, but the minis were a bit cramped inside the box and some of the sails were ready to break. Many tactical choices, the game is quite on the heavy side for non gamers. Need a lot of time to explain the rules. The buy/ sell goods mechanic is very nice, the upgrades to your ships are good, generally a very nice pirate game that everyone in my group loved. I would just like it to have a somewhat simpler combat mechanic, this one is a bit tricky to learn.

The will probably be the definitive pirate game for some years, although like the ancient Waddintons effort, Buccaneer, it's a little too easy to win by honest means. It's good to have the choice between trading and piracy (shades of the old computer game Elite here), but if everyone chooses the same role then the game weakens considerably. This is one of those rare cases where a game would have worked better with 6 players, the limit of 4 makes the Carribean look like a very large place and minimises interaction. I can live with the randomness given the reasonable playing time (can be as little as 2 hours). One of the best experience games currently out there.

This game is absolutely beautiful.  It's got a great theme and I love the twist where players can behave like merchants, pirates or pirate hunters. It also has cool special powers for both characters and places, and it's about the weight that I'd like it to be. So I was really excited about playing this game.

However, there were definitely some disappointments when I played.  For one thing, being a pirate doesn't seem to be a very good strategy; the one pirate in our game was pretty screwed. Secondly, the combat system is pretty clunky. It slows the game down considerably and is also confusing to calculate.  So I'd play again, but it's not as good as I'd hoped. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game I've been waiting for for 3 years when I heard about/stumbled upon it and it was called "Age of Piracy." I've been hankering for a good pirate game that really captures the flavor and fun of Sid Meier's Pirates (the video game).

Ultimately, the game achieves that goal to a degree. I've played 4 times and would like to continue to play it, but as you alude to, there is some downtime that drags it a bit. I've played 2 player, 3 player, and 4 player and 4 is probably the worst because of the downtime, however there are some neat "the board is too crowded, so you get pushed into interesting situations" that happen that are more infrequent with 2 or 3 players.

The design is really neat and truly captures the "Pirates!" feel that Sid Meier created in the video game. You can take on missions, try and raid merchants, be a merchant, pimp out your ship, fight other pirates/navies, etc. All of these really contribute to what I would define as an "experience" rather than a great game. When your small sloop gets into a ship to ship battle with a Man-o-war, you're really fighting to stay alive and maybe you narrowly escape. A great story can be told and I think that's more of the point of the game than to show off elegant mechanics with a pasted-on theme.

There are some interesting variants that add some difficulty to the game that I'd like to try, too. As there are some that make the 2 and 3 player game more "crowded" by increasing the search radius of the NPC pirates and navies.

Another plus for it, imho, is that Chiara doesn't mind playing it and with 2, it could easily be played in an hour and a half if both players are familiar with the rules. It can end quickly, too, as you can get 50% of the winning points by collecting gold that you secretly stash, so you're never sure when the game will end, which adds a nice bit of tension, if you're using the stash.

What I'd like to explore more is the viability of PvP combat. It seems a bit too easy to dodge combat if you want (which I think is good in a learning environment). This is a detraction I have with the game, but there is also a variant from the designer, Marcus, about fixing that, where you can blockade ports and force a player to at least have a chance to fight you. In vanilla rules, you can sale around with 50-60 gold and it's pretty hard to lose it, unless you really blow it.

Overall, I'd say it's a keeper. Chiara's family really likes the theme and the bits are amazing. They did a top notch job on production. I'd like to try the variants and I imagine will use them solely once people have played more than 2 or 3 times, as they add a bit more of a challenge. (From GCL 1/11/10)

I love, love, LOVE this game. The theme is brilliant, the design is achingly gorgeous, and it turns out I adore the sandbox nature (who knew?). I've started modding and upgrading my copy to really bling it out. I will say it can go a bit long, and the disparity between turn length depending on what you do that round ("I'm moving one two three ok your turn." "Hmmm...alright, well, lemme do some trading first...") can swing pretty wildly. Still, this box has given me some of the best stories of any game I own. Can't wait to grab the expansion once the reprint lands.

04/16: Got in a trade against Rampage.
Owned expansion : Seas of Glory

The best pirate game, period. It is pretty long though: I wouldn´t dare to play this with more than 3. A game that feels very thematic and that gives me the freedom I really like to have in board games. 

This game is often compared to Xia : Legends of a Drift System. I must say, I think I like M&M better, even though it lasts longer. The rules are more streamlined, more solid: the game is simply more balanced and playtested than Xia. It feels more elegant, less clunky, less fragile. I still like Xia though, it just can't be taken too seriously as the balance isn't as tight as one would hope and it's pretty luck dependent. Last but not least, M&M plays well with 2 players, where Xia wasn't designed to be played with less than 3 (even though it can work with 2).

Christian Marcussen is probably my favorite game designer at this point. Clash of Cultures is my #1 game of all time and this is in my top 5. 

I haven't played this in a while since I'm painting the minis (and there's a lot of delay).

RATING: 7.5
Excellent tie-in of theme and mechanics.  However, there is a lot more dependence on dice than I was expecting.  For example, to obtain a rumour, there is a mandatory monetary cost + dice roll; if successful, dice are rolled later to see if the rumour is true, and if successful again, dice are rolled once more to succeed at achieving rumour requirements.  Also, there is a tremendous variance in how long a turn takes to execute.  It could be as quick as 10 seconds as you move out of port, from one region to another, and into another port.  Or it could take 10+ minutes as you take ~ 8 port actions, raid a merchant ship, and/or get involved in combat with another ship.  Downtime can seem long even if you play a variant where players take their turns simultaneously when performing port actions.

Played at WifeGonCon 2012.

Yes, this game has random elements but I feel like that's what makes it fun. You're taking a risk going after someone (if you're the pursuer) and could lose everything that you've built up. It also suffers from major downtime but a good way to mitigate that is when someone takes the port action, the other player should start their turn.

Been playing a bit more lately - really great game, looking forward to expansion!

2016: expansion is great! Love weather, contraband, the moving storm, the expanded ship boards - pretty much all of it (save the terrible captain art). Modular expansions are the best kind!

Let's say we start at 10/10 for theme, artwork, general ideas, production value and compelling complexity. Unfortunately, then we have to subtract 2 for fiddliness and the complexity of certain actions and events (although well refected in the game mechanics) and another 2 for downtime alone. It gives us 6/10 for a very good game with two or three major faults. Still looking forward to playing it again, though. Yesterday I simply crushed my friends 10 to 4 at the most.

This is a really good adventure game. However, after 5 plays or so it got pretty boring as we pretty much did the same stuff every time. I'd say this is par for the course with adventure games though.

The concept is great, it feels just like playing Sid Meir's Pirates! and I think some expansions would make the game excellent and increase it's replayability. The game system seems pretty flexible and ripe for houserules and homebrew varients (I know there are a number of users on here experimenting in that realm).

Even though I got a little bored of the game I probably would have kept it but I traded it for another game that was high on my wishlist.

Bottom Line:
If you are really into the Pirate theme and you are willing to experiment with homebrews/varients this could be the perfect game for you.

2/10: Disappointing game. Regret buying it. Very rules complex so difficult to get to the table. But the decisions made aren't that interesting. On par with ameritrash decision making. Good theme.

Rating improved to 5/10: Played 4 players and the turns move quickly when others already know what to do. Played without missions. Give each player some thing to be in charge of e.g. money, cards, bounty tokens, etc.

Se trata de un juego de aventuras en el que somos un capitán de barco en el mar del caribe. A través de las acciones que realicemos nos iremos definiendo como mercante, si nos dedicamos a llevar mercancias de un puerto a otro o pirata si nos dedicamos a asaltar barcos, ya sea de otros jugadores, mercantes o barcos NPC.

En cada turno disponemos de tres puntos de acción que podrás gastar en movernos, actuar en un puerto o buscar/atacar barcos. 

Cuando actuamos en un puerto tenemos a nuestra disposición una buena cantidad de cosas a realizar, comprar y vender mercancías, oir rumores que si los cumplimos nos darán un punto, reparar nuestro barco, mejorarlo o cambiarlo por otro más grande (previo pago claro).

El combate está bastante logrado. Al inicio de cada ronda cada capitán elige una acción entre disparar, abordar o huir. Se hace una tirada que depende de nuestro capitán y el tipo de barco que tenemos, realizándose la acción que eligió el ganador. 

En general el juego es bastante majete y entretiene.

RATING: 7
First, I would rate this game as a 7'5 (because I have doubt a lot if rating it as a 7 or 8 XD). Having said that, I thing that it is a very good game, with some flaws to be taken into account (and this is why I have decided to put a 7), but, overall, it is very fun to play. Let's go for the review:
One of the things that I want in every game that I play is that it is thematic and that the mechanics are well related to the theme. In this case, I think that it works perfectly. You really have the feeling of being a pirate (or a merchant) and being on the Caribbean looking for treasures and gold. I really like the fact that you can play the game in several ways, you do not need necessarily to play as a pirate, a merchant works as fine (in fact, usually better than a pirate, that is one of the issues of the game).
Another positive aspect of the game are the components. Are of a very good quality, very nice and help to feel that you are actually on a ship (a bit of imagination guys). Then, I do think that the ship battles and configuration and improvements are very good. I do like the mechanic and it is fun to improve your ship and fight for the best one, try to capture the huge ships and all of that. But, this has a very negative point, which is what makes the game not that good, and is the fact that, if you lose your ship, specially at mid game, you are out. Ok, they allow you to put another vessel in play and continue playing but, practically, you can leave the table and sit on the sofa.
Positive:
- Highly thematic and mechanics that make total sense
- Wide range of available options (merchant, pirate, try to complete missions, rumors...)
- It is fun to play. Even if you know that you are going to lose
- Very good components and nice design
- Easy to explain and approachable to casual players (maybe not casual, casual)
Negative:
- It is more difficult to have success as a pirate than as a merchant
- The missions and rumors, in reality, are not a good way to go. They provide not enough points taking into account how many turns you need to expend crossing from one corner of the board to the other
- Losing your ship is almost game over. Specially during mid game
- Maybe a good "house rule" is to increase the victory points to 12 or 15, and allowing only to store 50 coins (as it is now). That will reduce the distance between merchants and pirates

RATING: 6
Sounds good so far, length can be tweaked, not sure about the dice though...

Hmmm seems to be quite a few reports of downtime, too long and too random, not exactly good features especially combined...sounds like it misses the mark and will need houserules. 

EDIT - Have now played with 3 players (rating is for 3 too, would definitely be lower for 4) and just about everything I noted above stands. Its a really cool overall package but yet something seemed missing or a little off, could be lack of strategic planning and decision making for a longer game and yes the luck seems too high for the length though it is a pirate game I suppose. Of course most of these things may NOT bother avid AT fans since they are used to them...

Playing a "merchant" can actually come out quite dry for such a thematic game too, your mostly just going to a port, selling, buying and then going to the next port. You have options on upgrading and such but the core of what your doing is somewhat repetitive especially as just a merchant. 

The game should scale well from 2 - 4 though I would not want to play with 4 due to increased downtime, 3 is a good number and 2 would be fine actually. As for the length, simply playing to less points makes a shorter game so really not one of the bigger sticking points for me, no matter the player number 2 hours is really the max for a game like this and that is how I would play it with possibly 90 minutes better yet. For the downtime, with next to nothing to really plan, its the bad kind with nothing to think about. 

I thought that it would be nice to somehow upgrade your "captain" stats (like boats) and this would help mitigate some of the luck (after a battle maybe?) but there was no such option other than firing his ass and paying the penalty to get a new one, some of them are better than others but I think upgrading would have been a good option and getting a weaker one right off the hop is crappy. Options to mitigate some of the dice luck would have been nice too, even card draws could have been pick 3 keep one, etc.  

I own Plunder and would love to play it to compare (which has some doosy warts of its own) and oddly enough this game has captured more than a couple concepts in a game I have close to a Prototype. Hopefully I'll be able to improve on some of the shortcomings but I do wonder now, maybe p/u & del just isn't that hot as a core mechanic...(I still love Die Handler though)

More a role-playing game than a strategy game, a good replacement for Pirate's Cove in my opinion. You feel more like a pirate, and there are non-pirate options to spice things up a bit. I like that you can get points by going on adventures too, makes it feel like a pirate movie/novel instead of just a treasure hunting game.

Surprisingly complex game.  Pirates in the Carribean.  Arrr!  Great theming.  Sail around either pirating the merchants or buying and selling cargo, getting victory points.  Many other ways to get victory points too, like special quests.  Every port has special abilities.  Every player has special abilities.  Trade up ships.  Bulk them up with special refits.  Can easily AP with all the choices so must plan ahead or game bogs down. Can be significant downtime while each player goes through a big list of options that can be carried out in a port or while they are going through a battle or merchant raid (otherwise would be a nine).

One of my favourite games! Perhaps too many die rolls, but it's extremely funny! A Not too heavy gameplay lets you entertain while sailing across the Caribbean. Despite its random dependence, I find a lot of strategy in it which can help you to mitigate randomness. A must have for those loving the Golden Age of Piracy!

The theme is this game is incredible and permeates every mechanic. And most of the mechanics are really fun and feel natural. However it is also an incredibly random game, where card drawing and especially die rolls make or break your game. It also has a lot of downtime and low player interaction, except for a few extremely brutal "take that" moments.

RATING: 7
It's got a lot of luck - it's got a load of text - it's got special rules bulging out of its portholes - but it's easy to learn, fun to play and a great implementation of theme.

A thousand times better than Pirate's Cove.

The 'cut-throat' and 'unmanouveurable' galleon variants are welcome; and I'm liking putting a few random NPC ships out at the start of the game.  

And thanks to ChristianMarcussen for the impressive level of support he has given the game here on BGG.

RATING: 8
This game is probably one of the coolest looking ones you'll find. A pretty board, boats, lots of little cards with missions and captains and all sorts of things, treasure chests and money, your own individual game board thing to keep track of your stuff. Pretty much, you look at it and you want to play it. And generally, the game doesn't disappoint. Based on what captain you get and his abilities, you can be a merchant or a marauder. Merchants generally go around collecting goods and selling them. Marauders tend to attack either other players or the non-player characters that are floating around as well. Let's just be honest, this game is pretty complicated. Definitely the most complicated of the ones I've listed here. You basically go from port to port, collecting missions and rumors or doing stuff with the goods, all with the end goal of getting victory points, which can be done in a variety of ways that I'm not going to go into detail explaining, because hell, you can look at the rules for that. It's a pretty fun game that can go really quickly or really slowly depending somewhat on what cards come up and somewhat on what the other players decide to do. But if you like pirates at all, you'll probably enjoy it. It's super thematic.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2011)

This is the game that ruined the pirates theme for me EVER, since I played this I really don’t want to play anymore games featuring pirates :( I’m not sure why but I feel almost an irrational hate toward this game. 

I don’t remember exactly why I don’t like it as it has been more than a year since I played this, however, I remember we didn’t finish our only game, it was very boring for all of us, and having to restart every time you were sunk was a mayor pain. In a word, the game was very boring, the downtime (and play time) excessive, the cards unbalanced, has too much luck without any mechanism to mitigate it.

I feel bad rating this game so low, it has great production values and it looks very nice, however I don’t want to play this again BUT I could be convinced if the right situation arises, thus I’m downgrading this to a 3.0. I’m sure it can be fun for other people, but I will try my best to stay away from it. 

Current Rating: 3.0

A couple more plays and the final victory situation isn't as perfect as I hoped.  Lowered from a 9 to a 8.

Only one play but I love this game.  This is everything that I've been waiting for in a pirate game.  There are a couple aspects of gameplay that seem abstracted and gamey but that is to be expected or this would bog down.  My only serious concern is the scoring system is sort of unbalanced but it doesn't matter since this is an experience game as much as anything else.  This should be hitting the table pretty often and it has the absolute best reason for player interaction - alot of gold you can steal from them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Of any other game I've played, M&M most closely resembles Blackbeard. Blackbeard is a game with huge potential but also some major issues: massive rules overhead and a thematic disconnect in that the main "anti-pirate" forces in the game are card plays from players controlling rival pirates. Merchants and Marauders goes farther toward realizing that potential. There's still a fair bit of rules complexity in the system, but this is mitigated greatly by the fantastic player aids. Whenever a key rule was mentioned during the rules explanation I would search for it on the player aid, and invariably I would find it there. In lieu of take-that cardplay, M&M introduces NPC vessels with straightforward hunt algorithms. This works in a very thematic way; a pirate who has specifically angered the English, for example, will be hunted at top priority by English naval vessels. Spain, however, will only hunt for this pirate if its vessel doesn't have anything better to do at the time, or if Spain happens to be at war with that pirate's home nation.

The aim of the game is for a player to gain Glory, which is acquired in several different ways: defeating another (player or NPC) captain in ship-to-ship combat, completing a Mission, discovering a Rumor to be true, completing a Merchant Raid of at least 12+ gold value, selling 3+ cargo that is "in demand" at a particular port, and upgrading one's ship to a Galleon or Frigate. Also players may stash gold at their home ports (using a ridiculous oversized treasure chest to hide the loot), and count that gold toward their end game glory condition at the rate of 10 gold/1 glory. Only half one's endgame glory may be achieved by stashed loot.

A player can choose whether to become a pirate (by raiding merchant ships and/or attacking non-pirate ships) or remain a law-abiding merchant, buying cargo low and selling it high where it is in demand. Piracy is riskier in that the navies are alerted to one's presence, but also has victory point sources not available to non-pirates. I was able to win my game as a pirate a turn ahead of Justin, who was a merchant. A glance through the game forums reveals other anecdotes of roughly 50/50 balance between merchant and pirate players.

Captains have four major stats which are rated 1-4: Seamanship, an opposed roll on which determines the captain's effectiveness in ship-to-ship combat; Scouting, which determines how easily a captain can find other ships to raid, plunder, and attack; Leadership, which affects crew-to-crew combat and the ability of a captain to recruit replacement crew; and Influence, which represents the captain's social status among the culture of the West Indies and is used for a variety of rolls involving Missions and Rumors. A higher rating means more dice, each of which has a 1/3 probability of a success. Generally one success is required to pass a check.

The game is fantastically detailed; each of the 16 ports has a special ability, there are 20+ different captains who all have different stats and abilities, and the ships all have their own stats and special upgrades available.

It is also an Ameritrash game through and through. There is a lot of dice rolling. None of it feels arbitrary to me; all die rolls can be planned for and the probabilities calculated in advance. But certainly a single session can feel like it was unduly influenced by luck, whether it be lucky dice rolling, a lucky merchant raid card draw, or lucky rumor/mission draws. This is fine for me, because I approach the game as a role-playing experience first, and a strategy game second. There's enough strategy to keep me interested though. The take-that gameplay is relatively toned down, which I find refreshing for a pirate game. Most cards tend to be ones that buff the player who draws them as opposed to screwing an opponent. The only take-that card I saw during our session was a card that allows a player to frame another captain for one of his pirate actions, allocating the bounty to another captain. This may be inconvenient for the framed player but isn't game-breaking at all, and advances the theme.

Update:  less of a game here than I'd hoped.  Perhaps I need to play it with 4.

Beautiful board and bits, great theme, but it seems a bit long for what it is. The play is somewhat linear, as aside from choosing to be a merchant or pirate, the choices seem to be pretty obvious according to the card draws. The result is the gameplay feels a bit scripted and predetermined, which can be a drag for a 4 hour game. Lots of downtime as well, which is not a good attribute for a longish game to have.

For a game this length there is a lot of randomness.  If your group is overly competative I'd stay away from this one.

This is a pretty great "pick up and delivery" game, themed around trading goods in the Caribbean. What makes it awesome, though, is the fact that every player has a choice to make... Merchant? or Pirate?

2013-06-13 - I've only played it once (and that was a while ago), so I don't yet have the combat mechanics down well enough to fairly judge them. The game is fun, though, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

2017-11-06 - I've learned that pick up and deliver games just aren't my thing, and this one has a little too much rules complexity for me on top of that.

Merchants & Marauders is an extremely well-designed game. One of the strongest thematic games I have played. The game truly tells as story, and you feel like you are playing the role of a merchant/pirate. Luck is too strong a factor and the combat is a little quirky, but a solid game.

Using your unique captain, command one of four ship types in delivering goods and/or raiding ships, but with the keen awareness that you can attract the attention of another nation's armada by raiding them or if the two countries go to war. With so many ways to get to the winning condition, it becomes a bit complicated and there is a slow buildup —- but if you don't mind a longish game with decent strategy based on real piracy in the Caribbean, this one's for you.

PLUS: many options to victory, theme, challenge
MINUS: slow buildup, not a quick start to learn

I love the theme and setting of this game and playing it is a blast! Merchants & Marauders is THE game to get for sailing the high seas. Plenty of strategy and choices to choose as you adventure through the Caribbean.

RATING: 7
There are many ways to get points in this game, and you don't have to be a pirate to win. Which is a good thing. There's a lot to say about being able to choose the flavor you want to play, anywhere in the spectrum between merchant and pirate - sometimes one, sometimes the other... The game seems to flow better with 3 players. With 4, I'm finding the game to drag a bit. Too much down time.

Have only played once and we decided to only play for 5 glory points since we didn't want to invest the time in an entire game. Liked this game A LOT! Right now, it gets a great rating from me (although this could change). A bit much to remember every detailed thing to do (like reading the special instructions on the sea spaces... we always forgot to do that). But still, a beautiful game, wonderfully designed, with lots of choices to make.

Butt loads of theme, a little broken, but fun all the same. Honestly, you can get so swept up in the theme that you'll never notice the little flaws. I only noticed them because of reviews and such. Unfortunately, the game length detours lots of players.

I find that the game play is fantastic and extremely enjoyable.  The biggest downside to this game is the time between turns is a bit too long in a 4 player game, but a 3 player game doesn't provide players on the board to be a concern.

RATING: 8.5
Ameritrashy pirate game bursting with theme. Beautiful production. Clearly painstakingly researched, I felt I got a bit of a history lesson while playing as pirates. The pirates each have their own "powers," so there's an nice asymmetry that adds to replayability and makes things interesting. There's a lot going on here, you really need more than one play to get a feel for everything, it's pretty complex and has a lot of chrome. But, when you're in the mood for an adventure on the high seas, and want to really feel the theme pervade the mechanisms, I'd recommend this one highly. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Anyone following the post-release chatter about this game will have noted complaints of imbalance between the game's two overarching paths: trading and piracy. Players are divided about this, which to me speaks to a different sort of mischief afoot in the design. I would say that the imbalance is not between two broad strategies, but between the game's ambitious layers of thematic chrome and the underlying victory conditions. The options available to you seem way, way out of whack with what it takes to win. Several ship types, 8 different ship upgrades, 3 special weapons, a variety of specialists and captains, distinct options in every region of the board... all that, and I buy-low-sell-high for a Glory Point? Or listen/confirm a rumor in much the same fashion?

I want to like this game, but it feels like gamers who simply follow the VP will breeze through the system and miss all the scenery. The narrative arc seems practically non-existent. I also wonder if piracy is simply more interesting than trading. Even if the two are balanced, one should not have the lion's share of complexity.

Merchants and Marauders might be a home run, but I have my doubts. I worry that the designers built a house first and added the foundation later.

UPDATE: After a second play, I give this design a vote of no confidence. I don't think the game buried underneath the chrome is even remotely interesting. The chrome itself seems to float freely, unmoored from any actual purpose. Add to that the fact that, taken as an experience game, there's hardly any narrative arc or sense of accomplishment, and there's not much left to redeem Merchants and Marauders.

Wow.  Pretty cool game that feels just like "Sid Meier's Pirates!".  The AI of the game is exceptionally well done (how the NPCs adjust their movement to reflect nearby adversaries, how goods are supplied and demanded, how weather is simulated, etc) and the battles are tightly contested.  Some have argued that it's a merchant game with a pirates theme.  I would agree, but alter that statement to say it's a pirate game, with a merchant theme; just like the time it is portraying.  Like any game, you need to weigh the pros and cons of any situation and do what will achieve victory.  Sometimes it will be advantageous to safely ply your trade and avoid conflicts.  Until that is, a rich reward presents itself and you are suitably prepared to seek out battles.  Everything is in here and it feels like and Ameritrash Euro.  Lovely!  I've been eagerly anticipating this game since it's earliest inception as "Age of Piracy" and I've not been disappointed.  The only reason it's a 9 and not a 10 is because it's a long playing game, and so will be difficult to reach repeated plays with my current "Play Group".  However, it's Soll-eed!

M&M is dubbed as an experience game. But it's not an experience I'm looking out for again. Booooring! Admittedly, all three of us were merchants which isn't the best precondition for an adventurous game. The good thing about this was that it became obvious how simple and luck-dependent the norm strategy for merchants is: buy three of a kind and sail them to a port with demand for that kind. If you don't draw the right cards buy two and sell them in the same port. Repeat until you have three of a kind and sail to the next harbour. Avoid pirates which is not too difficult. In between, players grab and complete/fail rumours and missions as luck will have it. Accumulate one VP for every trade/rumour. Where's the experience in gaining a VP? If M&M wasn't claiming to provide a story, strategic options and playtime wasn't above two hours it would be acceptable. As it is it's just pretentious. M&M got me thinking if the only way to enjoy experience games is (semi-)cooperative (Arkham Horror, Middle-Earth Quest etc.).

25 June 13 - Sadly, I'm over this game. Was exciting when we first got it but it takes too long for what it is. It takes ages to get from one place to another and you end up sticking to your corner of the board rather than sailing all over it. Played it the other day with friends and we abandoned it half way through. Still we had a good time with it for a while. 7 Wonders, Stone Age, Caylus & the Village have taken over.

- why 4 types of ships when 1 is clearly superior and with some luck available on turn one?
- why rumours and quest when you can just go trade and win the game?
- why do people who play peacefully stand a much better chance at winning in a pirate game?!?

All in all the game is very unbalanced and not enjoyable, sad because the concept and components are superb!

RATING: 3
I feel bad rating the game this low, as the production quality is high and I can see that it has been very warmly received.  It simply reflects my willingness to play the game again.  I would refuse except for really extreme circumstances.

In theory I think the dichotomy between merchant and marauder is interesting, but when actually playing the game, being a merchant is really boring (though ended up being a viable strategy), especially since the combat actions are so time consuming.  This leads to an unacceptable amount of downtime that simply is not interesting for the players that are not involved.  I can imagine that once everyone is comfortable with the rules that the experience could pick up speed, but I know that we will not make it there.

Wow. Where to even begin with this one?

The game is beautiful, the components are great, the gameplay is fun, the stuff you can do is cool, it's pirates the way I want to play them BUT the game is such a slog. There's very little progress in the game. We played for almost 2 hours and had achieved 4 of the 10 points required to win.

There is so much to love here, but I have to look up some variants to improve the slog. A rating will have to wait for now.

I don't own a pirate game and this would likely be tops on my list to fill that niche.

I like the mechanic of choosing to be a merchant or pirate too.

2018-02-11 - 7.5 - It really is Sid Meier's Pirates! the boardgame and it is the best pirate game I've played. I really enjoyed it. Our first play took us 3 hours including rules explanation. Even considering some errors we made (which could make the game to go a little bit faster than it should) I think it is a really decent length of play. The theme is there and it is almost everything you could want in that setting. But it is an adventure game and you need to accept that before playing. You can trade, you can arm and fight, or do both. You can have adventures, missions, there is a threat of NPC pirates, of the navy and of the other players too. It can be swingy, you can be lucky (or not), but that's the part of the theme, I think. There is a lot of rolling dice and drawing cards and if you don't like that, it's not the game you are looking for. I'm looking forward to play it again.

Purchased Jan 2011. 

Been looking forwards to this for a long time. Can't wait to get it to the table, hopefully it will see play on Sunday.

Edit, played with 2 players to make sure we knew the rules. Felt rather underwhelmed after that. Hoping for better with 4 players next time up. If it isn't better then it may well get traded.

4 players was better, but despite winning I still felt it was a bit of a procession. In serious danger of being traded.  Traded away 3-2-11

Each game was won by a trader taking no risks, just quietly earning cash and completing simple missions. Pirates were not even half way to winning at the time. I so wanted this to be awesome, and its not.

I enjoy the idea of being able to choose between two paths of victory. The game does seem to be fairly obvious and repetitive as far as the way turns go. I had gone into this game thinking it was more of a Euro, and why I did i'm not sure, but this is very much Ameritrash. High variance on dice rolls during skill checks adds for increased tension. Direct player conflict is encouraged and welcomed. Overall, I felt the game was very good, component quality was excellent, and theme was there, but just left me wanting. Solid 7. I wouldn't mind playing again, but as a pirate.

Arrrrrr!!!

Best adaptation of the pirates theme - until now. I have some issues with rumors vs. missions (missions seem to be useless most times) and the too simplified trade system. It is far to easy to win with the merchant, while playing a pirate may be more fun at the beginning but frustrating at the end. Merchants don't suffer any disadvantages while pirates always are very luck-dependend and risk their ship and life every turn. A pity this game is so unbalanced. We like it because of the theme but we always end up a bit disappointed when noticing the merchant will make it again...

Still an "8" because of the theme. We DO suggest it from time to time. But without the theme it would be more a "6"...

Lower mark for the game out of the box. Merchants always win. With a couple of simple rule tweeks to give the pirates a chance (like limiting the amount of Glory for gold and for selling goods) it's an 8.

Long game with mixture of strategy and luck--both of which can blow up in your face at any time. After four hours, I was in first place with 5 glory points. That's only half-way, and we decided to stop. Liked it, but I would only play this again with major house rules.

Seems to take around 1 hour per player, which feels slightly long.

Was more impressed with this playing than reading about it. It comes together nicely and plays smoothly without the chrome getting in the way.

Epic game that has some elements of RPG. The theme is well served, and while the game can take a while, one feels that they have taken part in an experience, not just a game. Similar feel as Mage Knight.

Played once with 3 players; fantastic how they managed to get most of the mechanics of Sid Meier's Pirates (computer game) in a board game, great battle system also, but there's not that much action, lots of down time (going into port takes a long time) even with just 3 players, and I drew a captain with the lowest seafaring capability which meant I could only trade or had to forfeit a turn early on to change captains. So a disappointing experience but I'd try it again.

Sid Meier's: Pirates! in boardgame form. Really, almost down to the smallest detail. Not that that's a bad thing of course, Pirates! was a great game. 
The play is a bit slow though, and playing as a pirate is far more difficult than playing as a merchant due to the bounties blocking you from ports, Military ships chasing you and the far to high risk attacking other players for far too low a reward, most of the time.

RATING: 7
Strange to fell this way, but I wish the game was 25% less elaborate/involved.
1.For such a luck based game (dice, card draws & more dice rolls & card results) its way to intricate.
2.Like,,,There is 2 different combat systems. TWO!
3. There are so.. soo many if ,ands, maybes, possibles & buts.. its off to the rule book to go thru tie-breaker steps,  
 situation resolves and finding remedies to rectify circumstances and player/NPC combat .  [[ Oh, they're accounted for in the book,,,, just wish they were not necessary  ]]
(and that reminds me, there's so many 'Fails' that can happen to you. Makes you wish there were fewer tests with more chance for success,
It would be more player fun I'd think )

It's not a game for casual / medium-level gamers who want to go pirating. (sad face) 
And that brings me back to my first line above. 
"It could of been much more by being less"

Your gaming gang need to be a experienced gamers  And Pirate luv'ers
If you/your buddies are willing to not be harried about the games profundities, or the clock ,, And just want to go along for a 'Caribbean Cruise' like no other !
_ Get this game to the table!

All that said, if the game is suggested for play, its 'Hell yes I'll play'.

You can play this game in great manner of was, a merchant, a pirate, a bounty hunter or just run missions and rumors like an adventurer, all on your own ship, piloted by a captain you chose and your crew! You really dont have many games set in this time period. It is really unique.

I had high hopes for this: sounded like a Pirates! (the old computer game which I've played/liked a lot) -the boardgame. And it is - kind of. Unfortunately there isn't that much game in here AND most of the time you are not playing the game, just making all the adjustments there are OR waiting for your turn. This is very much multiplayer solitaire which is also a bad thing. Oh, and this was a first time in a many years and hundreds of different games played when I saw a game, which eliminates TOTALLY what you have achieved and where you've start from the beginning (not Glory points included). So, would I play M&M again? Definitely not. If I'm having 3-4 hour slot, something like Indonesia would be much better option for me...

RATING: N/A
In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean. The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 "glory" points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship. While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed. Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.

RATING: 9
My favorite pirate game. Sometimes you have to settle back into the pace of seafaring sailing vessels of the time as a player's turn can go for a while but it's usually interesting to see what happens to them. A whole lot of theme and flavor in this one.

First four-player game was slightly disappointing as excessive down-time marred the experience. (1/30/11)

Chaotic, flavorful, and fun.  Dice rolling required for nearly everything.  So not for players who demand a high level of control, but this game is more about the experience and less about competitive play.  And the game supports a rich experience with high quality components and great variety of events and card play. I'm not a huge fan of adventure type games, but I really enjoyed this one.  Unlike many games in that genre, this one plays smoothly and quickly.  Recommended.

VERY ameritrash - lots of RNG/theme, mechanics are just OK. PVP mechanics do not feel fun as penalty for sinking your friend is very harsh and feels like you unfairly targeted them for no good reason. Beautiful components.

If you like games such as Arkham Horror, you will love it.

If you're more into Eurogames, you will probably dislike it.

I sold mine after 1 play.

Very disappointed with M&M. Played it twice and shelved it. After hearing all the hype of this game, I was expecting much more than a pick up & deliver style game. Merchants are the only smart way to play the game. We tried house-ruling to make pirates viable, then realized we would rather be playing ANY other game on the shelf. 

Too slow, minimal interacting, and lopsided strategies means this game will never leave my shelf again. For trade.

If anyone is looking for a better version of this game, try Xia.

Edit thru 2025: Still hasn't left my shelf. Seriously... someone please take this game off my hands. I will delete my review when I no longer have this horrific game staring at me.

The game seems to have everything to be a blast for me: You choose a captain, get a ship (which can be oriented to commerce or plundering) and sail for glory and fortune during 2 hours or so. The game gives you absolute freedom, so you can switch your approach from commerce to pirating whenever you want -or the other way round, even this can be harder due to the penalties you get to commerce in a territories belonging to a nation you have attacked in the past-. 

There is a lot going on in this game: quests which not only give you immediate benefits but also victory points, ship upgrades and specialists wich improve your maneurability or make you more lethal in battle, naval combat which is simple but gives enough freedom to not feel boring... 

Regarding the drawbacks of the game:

-The captain you get marks your strategy to a certain extend. Indeed, if you get a captain not suited for pirating and you want to follow this approach, you are going to fight an uphill battle. This, I feel, goes against the freedom the game offers you, and for this reason I believe that M&M is one of those games for which asymmetric characters are a con instead than a pro. 

-In a 4 player game, it is not uncommon that at the middle of the game certain players have almost no choice of winning. Moreover, as these players are generally weaker than the leaders, it is almost impossible for them to revert this situation by attacking those in the lead. For a game of the length of M&M, this is a relevant drawback. 

-The game-breaking issue with this game: Pace. The game drags a lot, as it is not uncommon to have to wait 5 to 10 minutes without having anything to do, while your turns can be straightforward. 

All in all, a promising game with a great concept, but with two major drawbacks (pace, rich gets richer syndrome) which make it fall short at the end of the day. Non advisable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really cool pirate-themed "euro game" with lots of opportunity for backstabbing, ship-to-ship combat and swashbuckling adventures.  The nice thing is that there are multiple paths to achieve glory (victory) with two main paths being a Merchant or a Pirate (or a little of both). 

VARIANT: We play with 15 Gold per Glory Point when Burying Treasure on your Home Island (max. 5).  Without this variant rule, it is too easy to win using a pure Merchant strategy and also too difficult to win using a pure Pirate strategy.

As I get older I find I tend to like games with some semblance of theme to them. I have played a million games now where I swap cubes for victory points, and having a different type of auction in them or an elegant turn order mechanic or whatever in them just does not make any difference. And I've impressed so many noblemen and master builders that I shouldn't even have to prove my skill anymore. So, given the chance to do something, I'll usually jump at it. 

Merchants and Marauders is what so many new games forget to be: fun to play. It's one of those games that has a narrative, that you continue to talk about long after it's over. It's got some rough patches, but I will gladly swap fun for cold, burnished "elegance". I even stayed on the straight and narrow the whole game, and won as a merchant, which means, of course, I have to play it again and be a pirate!

This game sometimes feels very anticlimatic for me. It's GREAT, you feel like discovering new lands, and the two aspects of the game (pirating and commerce) work perfectly, but some times it ends so abruptly that most people I've played them with always have that "that's it!?" look on their faces when it ends. 
There's no feeling of great acomplishment, there's no story telling or great scheme or plot behind it. It feels sometimes as if they work around one mechanic and just added chrome to it (the build your ship mechanic), and that doesn't appeal to me in a 3-4 hour game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best pirates game IMO, as of this writing.  It takes a while but I think that is necessary for a game of this many options and for it to feel like a true epic pirate's tale.

You can do pretty much everything that pirates are supposed to do.

It is somewhat of a euro pick-up-and-delivery game.  You have to work that like a machine in order to win the game, and kind of make all the interesting quests/messing with others as side-goals that you only do if it's convenient along your route.  So as long as you understand that it's fine.  But that does feel a little bit non piratey.  At least, it's not a romantic view of piratism.  But it's probably kind of realistic.

There is some luck in some of the expansion components and with where goods come out...but not the kind of luck that bothers me at all.  There are always options available to you, and a lot of the decisions are about how much risk you want to take on.  The risk inherent to attacking other ships or sailing into storms...well it makes sense.  just adds to the theme for me.

Each player not only has a different pirate, but I feel there is an actually unique narrative being spun throughout the game, of where they went to, why they made different decisions, the fighting between other players, the nations going to war...etc.  It always feels like an actual story was told.  One of the best thematic games ever, for me.

Component quality is great.  Obviously the ships are pretty great.  The pirate cardboard tokens for money look really good for cardboard.  I replace them with my own metal money of course.  The map is great.  I guess I hope that they will eventually make another map...let's be the pirate of the indian Ocean, please!  But I could deal with just one map for a long time, especially considerin the Locations component of the expansion.

The expansion adds enough things that I feel the replayability is going to be very high for us.

I like all the stats you have on your captain and ship.  They feel very thematic, and just the right balance of being meaningful in thematic ways, and yet not being so complex that you get really annoyed.

Make no mistake the rulebook is pretty intense for a newbie to boardgames.  You have to set aside the time to learn it well.  But once you do, the experience makes it totally worth it.

I guess my only complaint would be that if it could somehow be all done in a more streamlined way with easier to remember rules...that would be awesome.

RATING: 9
Very fun, medium weight sandbox game, with a great PvP implementation and lack of player elimination. Mission, rumor and glory cards add a lot to the flavor. Also, the replay value is great. The only point stopping me from giving it 10 stars is the rare luck factor, which can tip the scales very heavily in some ocasions. However, the flavor texts keep it fun for everyone.

Overall, great for both a casual and a lightly competitive experience.

A really good sunday-autum-afternoon type game. While perhaps not totally authentic, M&M delivers great atmosphere and that good-time pirate feel, while you can still go the merchant way, of course (it seems that staying on the good side of the law is for the best, until you have the funds to upgrade to the bigger ships, along with any upgrades). 

There are a number of subsystems, that aren't all totally intuitive, but the game flows well, after a surprising low number of turns. Our first outing took 3.5 hours, but that should come down, now we have seen how some of the dynamics interact

Great components to an otherwise unenjoyable experience. This game is so punishing to new players AND long duration I can't fathom them coming back a second time. I certainly won't. 

- High variance experience. You can try to plan for your turn, but so many things can happen in between that you often don't get to execute what you originally planned. 
- Low investment to other players' turns, and long downtime between turns. I generally don't care what other players are doing. I care about where they are and where they can reach, but there's no reason to pay ask those questions until it's your turn again. This is particularly true because you're not intended to know your opponents' gold stash / expenditures.
- The hidden gold system combined with paying variable costs is clunky and exacerbated by the 'verification' system. 
- The punishment system of combat (you lose everything and restart minus current VPs) is very punishing. Combine with an obtuse combat system that makes combat prediction difficult, and expect a large ship turnover rate and players feeling like they are just losing turns because they don't understand how to play.

This just may sum up the game:  long on theme, short on strategic decision-making.  This is after one game, so take my analysis with a grain of salt.  Even so, I suspect I'm right about this.

The captain's stats drive what type of strategy a player should adopt (pirate vs. merchant) - there isn't really a strategic decision to be made as the stats pretty much make the decision for you - and after that the rest of the game is turn after turn of executing on that strategy.  But I'm not sure there are a whole lot of strategic decisions in the execution of a particular strategy.  Players will move from sea space to sea space and do whatever it is their role dictates - merchants buy and sell goods at port and pirates attack other ships.

Put another way, once a player selects a role at the very outset of the game, the player's strategy for the entire game is set.  There don't appear to be any real variations on what a player should do as a pirate, or what a player should do as a merchant.  And if there aren't any variations, are the moves the player makes "decisions," or merely the execution of a pre-determined script?  I have my suspicions about the answer to that, but the theme of the game is enough right now to bring me back for some additional plays.

This is the ultimate pirate game.  There's a huge feel to it: this is about as sandbox-y as you can get without pushing into the complexity of something like Magic Realm.  The downside of the game is the combat: it's logical, interesting, intuitive, and [i]way too long[/i] (especially for the non-participating players).  However, the economy system is great, the rumors and missions are thematic, and the NPC system is clever as hell.

A very good pirate game.  You play either a Merchant or a Pirate with Merchants delivering goods to ports and earning glory points.  Or you be a Pirate and conduct merchant raids to earn glory points.  You can earn glory with missions, rumors and stashing money.  You can upgrade your ships, attack NPC ships or other players.  Players tend to be very conservative though.  

The game is very fun but after many plays, players tend to all be Merchants.  The game gets a reputation that it ought to be called Merchants and Merchants.  It is a fair criticism.  The components are great though and I really like the game.

Played a few times.

Deep, gorgeous game oozing in theme with multiple paths toward victory and adjustable level of PvP.  Difficulty varies depending on path chosen.  Nice strategic thinking.  Too wide open for 2 players.  Even with 2, however, long game.  Adjusting the length of game using different victory point goals prevents players from gaining significant progression, however, and favors the merchant path.  Sold mostly due to length of playtime plus availability of similar games on the PC.

Interested in playing again.  No chance of repurchase.

Immersive and nail-biting when it's your go, can drag slightly at first when other players are taking long turns and/or learning the rules.

Update: definitely best with 4 players so there is more opportunity for player v player conflict.

The directions to this game are probably the most complicated I own next to mansions.  There is a lot to learn which makes it difficult to teach.  On the other hand, this game is bursting with piratey theme and is really really fun.  I love anything pirate and this game did not disappoint.  It started out slow when I was just trying to deliver goods and take the safe way to victory and then I said screw it and start attacking boats.  That's when the game really became fun!

played twice, two learning games...still lots of things to figure out before this game becomes second nature.  I love the theme and the gameplay itself but still waiting to learn it more so it seems less fiddly.

We totally played the event system wrong the first time, whereby every player pulled a card each turn.  Game ended too soon obviously.

Soaked, SOAKED in theme.  Everything makes sense too, which is just a treat.  There is a lot to take in, many decisions to make, but just a fun, interesting game. Just enough randomness with the dice to make it interesting too.

A great game for house rules, but I don't think it scales very well.

Very glad I picked this up!

Very enjoyable game with many options and two career paths that are both quite different and interesting. To many people out there do not see the broader aspect of this game and complain about the lack of player interaction. If you play in your corner of the map and avoid all others that's your fault. But if you engage other players and take the fight to them things can change dramatically even if you just prevent them from leaving a port for fear of being attacked. This is a game I will be playing a lot of in the coming months!

An exceptionally fun game.  Be ye merchant or pirate, you'll enjoy sailing around the Caribbean, avoiding the ships hunting for you (either naval ships, pirates, or your fellow players WILL be hunting for you), and earning Glory to win the game.

Rules take a little while to get into, but they're quite good.  Combat rules aren't overly complex, though they seem that way at first.

I've always wanted a pirate game like this and didn't even know it.  Kudos to the designers!

At last the pirate game I have been waiting for. I have only played 2 player so far but every game has been more interesting than the last......The family enjoyed this one although the life of the pirates seems harder to turn into a winning score, I suspect we are just too nice to each other and let merchant players run around un-hampered.

RATING: 8
The only problem with this game is the downtime when it's not your turn, especially when everyone but you ports.  No matter how prepared the players are, their actions will be influenced by the goods or the rumor they draw so they have to think on the spot.  Still, it drips with theme and succeeds at making both the merchant and the pirate enjoyable to play.

An 'East-India Company' themed game where you can choose to be either merchants or pirates, with various ways to achieve the 10 glory points needed to win the game. The game is very open-ended compared to most board games, and you can do quite a number of things on your turn. However, the game is just a bit too dry when you finish your turn, as you have to sometimes wait 5 - 10 minutes per person to finish their turns. The combat system, on the other hand, works very well and is, in my opinion, the highlight of the game. If you love sea games, you will love this game. For me, I prefer theme-based games, and in this case, 'Merchants & Marauders' is stronger in mechanic than theme.

Indeterminate after three 4p games.  We are just too peaceful is probably the issue - it all comes down to stashing huge wads of gold, not getting much glory otherwise.

After another batch of games... easily the best real pirate game out there.  The right amount of complexity to allow the theme to work.  Play it with the right attitude - not about winning, it is about doing cool pirate-y things.  Very luck-oriented, so be warned it isn't about optimization.

I thought it would be like Fury of Dracula with Pirates. In some ways it is. That is, it's beautiful, thematic, rather lengthy and rules-complex. They also both have beautiful production and nice bits. Yet it differs in some ways. I think Fury is more confrontational. The only way to beat Dracula is to confront him and kill him. In Merchants, you can win by simply gaining victory points (glory points) whether you choose to be a pirate or merchant. The combat is cleaner in Merchants, so it definitely has a leg up there. Conversely, the combat feels slightly more thematic in Fury, and I appreciate that. Both games are quite random due to heavy card play. If you are looking for a luck-free game, neither would be a good fit. I think I like Fury more, because it's so great to be Dracula. But Merchants might be more balanced because whether you are a pirate or a merchant, you feel like you are building something, not wandering aimlessly around Europe. Geez, they're both soooo good! Definitely pick up Merchants and Marauders though. If you don't mind spending the better part of an afternoon learning the ruleset and writing off the first game as a "learning game," then you won't be disappointed in the long run.

After 1 play:

Fun game, great theme but very long.  I enjoyed the ability to build up (pimp out) one's ship with upgrades to supplement the weaknesses of a particular ship/captain; and also to upgrade to more fearsome ships.

There is also a reasonable amount of downtime on other players' turns and it can be difficult to plan too far ahead - both of which slow the game down.

Reminded me of a computer game generally (in the same way that Eclipse does) but also the specific game of Sid Meyer's Pirates! (which I loved).

Merchant strategy seemed more powerful (odd for a game about pirates), but could just have been the captains we were playing.

While I enjoyed it, I doubt I'd be able to play it much if I bought a copy.  Certainly too long to play with my wife (who likes lighter and shorter games).

Great components, wonderful artwork, a thematic experience. The game is really dependent on the group you play with. It can be a trouble free trading game or a cutthroat battle around the Caribbean.

THE PIRATE GAME! all other pirate games are inferior before this. Captures the theme of piracy and trading in the Caribbean perfectly.

At its best with 4 people, but its a long game 2hrs+

UPDATE: I used to really like this game but the battle just slows gameplay down soo much and has so many small rules. And late game sometimes can degenerate into an all out war with every player fighting twice which can take over an hour for 1 round!!

UPDATE 2: bought it back, its just such an awesome game!!!

With the endless hours spent on Pirates! in the eighties, there wasn't a minute when I haven't thought back to it playing Merchants & Marauders, and I think it doesn't need more compliment than that. It has everything that Pirates! had ([i]except for stalling for long minutes in the middle of the Caribbean due to dead calm or headwind.[/i])
Very thematic and very dynamic. I loved our very first game, where as a fledgling Dutch pirate I thought that with only one Spanish bounty on my head and with only two Dutch ports in the game it couldn't hurt to attack a Dutch merchant. Three rounds later San Juan was captured by the Dutch, and England was in war with Netherlands. With every Naval ship on my heel, only a few ports available, and two opponents playing a safe game as merchants, I still managed to win, and it [i]felt[/i] like victory.

Fun although long game where you can be a merchant, marauder or both!  Great mix of pick-up-and-deliver, task fulfillment, pirating from neutral ships and other players, etc.  Outfit your ship with guns and specialists, become public enemy number one or try to keep a low profile and just be peaceful goods trader.

Very thematic and I think many will enjoy it.  My two biggest complaints are the time (can run long) and the fact that I won my first game with the boring merchant strategy.  I suppose the other players (mostly pirates) could have made more of an effort to shoot me out of the water and steal my goods.

I really enjoy this game. It is good with 2 players and also the solo variant from here; https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108797/merchants-marauders-solo-rules , I would suggest if playing the solo variant to play as a pirate. The game is not easy to teach and takes a couple of playthroughs before you fully grasp it without having to go back and forth to the rules, but regardless this game is really good and the theme really comes through.

One thing that we do is make two event piles, one with ships and the other storms and alternate drawing from each pile.  Even though it means you know that a ship or storm will happen next it makes it more balanced as in some games you could go several rounds with no ships entering play or too many too fast.

Epitome of "thematic experience" game, second only to perhaps Betrayal at House on the Hill. One third of the turns experienced a "storm" which was 90% of the way to "lose a turn." Hot and cold turns are either completely uneventful (I move my ship two spaces) to 15-minute long battles between two players (one of whom may only be acting on the part of an NPC rather than having his own skin in the game) while the other players sit around bored. I can see why thematic players might be into it, but certainly not my style of game.

RATING: 9
Simply a great, well balanced, straightforward and fun game that's dripping with theme, which is further supported by it's beautiful artwork. 
It will most certainly have some downtime when you're gaming with inexperienced or indecisive players, but the rules are not as complex as they may seem at first glance, and gameplay will pick up speed pretty soon.

RATING: 6
I like some elements of Merchants and Marauders quite a bit, but for me the overall experience is ultimately lackluster. Game setup and play seemed a little overly fiddly to me. Also, players can be derailed for the whole game just by one unlucky turn of events that blocks you from hitting the port you need to get to for a turn or two. Finally the game generally tends to end abruptly with one person completing a quest and dumping gold in his home port and going from 3 or 4 points to 10. Components are great, I like the special missions, crew upgrades, ability to turn pirate but those elements aren't enough to redeem the overall game for me.

Oof! This just isn't my kind of game. The rules are convoluted enough that my group spends half the time buried in rulebooks and player aids. I don't find the merchanting interesting at all and the randomness and "screw you" cards can permanently derail whatever tactics you're attempting. What really kills it for me is the downtime during turns. What the other players are doing is frequently uninteresting and your decisions are usually not the kind that you have to think about for 10 minutes. I will say that the piracy can be kind of fun, but if you don't draw a captain with some piracy skills it's just not going to work out for you. This game isn't broken or anything, but I really hope that I don't have to play this one again.

What brilliant fun this all is - finally a Pirate game that gets it right without sacrificing too much detail or forcing players toward too much abstraction. I felt our first play was a bit long, and the game especially slowed down anytime anyone took a port action, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the experience and am looking to pick up a copy of this for myself.
-------------------
After a third play of this, I am starting to feel a little tired of it. It's a fun thematic romp, but there is not enough depth to hold my interest, and the pick up and deliver mechanic really wears thin. Not enough pirate - too much euro in this one.

As of our eighth play, we're still trying to find a balance between vanilla rules (where merchants win every single time we play) and cutthroat, spread VP, or other variant (where pirates win every single time). Still enjoying the games, though; just trying to make it more balanced. 

Update: Once our pirate players have become better pirates, it's rare to see a straight merchant win this game. Usually all players tend to do a bit of everything to get points, instead of being one thing or another. Certainly makes the game more replayable, and more enjoyable.

The theme is pretty strong on this game, which I like.  I also like that is very sandbox-y, letting you determine your own fate.  There is a healthy dose of randomness between the combat dice rolls and various decks within the game, but you frequently have mitigation mechanisms.  There can be non-trivial downtime between turns when the board state gets busy.

This game feels like you're really on an adventure! Imagine you and your ship sailing the Caribbean, trading, doing missions and checking out rumors, raiding ships. Play in a way that you like.

The game involves dice rolls and card draws. This scares off some players. It doesn't scare me off: I enjoy my games, a lot!

As the game's owner, first take your time to read the rules and try out the typical game situations.
The game is on the lengthy side. I'd love to be able to play it more frequently...

I'd love it if I'd be able to play it with 6 players in roughly the same time as a 4-player game now.
I've seen great ideas on the forums and an expansion is coming, someday. I can't wait!

I think it would be tough to make a game with more pirate theme that was this enjoyable. It has everything a player might expect from the genre; rumors, missions, and a way to win with any career path (although I like playing the grey area between pirate and merchant in this system). I look forward to possible expansions, like more cards, ships, and maps.

Arrr mates, a nice game, highly highly unbalanced towards the merchants. But funny, well done with great materials (some minor bending in 1 miniature, not a big deal), hugely thematic, slow.

The official variants in the expansion upgrade the experience, imho, and they must be included in the base game, particularly the gold/glory ratio:
first 10 gold = 1st Glory
15 more gold = 2nd Glory
20 more gold = 3rd Glory
25 more gold = 4th Glory
30 more gold = 5th and last Glory point

Almost twenty years ago i played sid meiers pirates to death (pc). I have been waiting for two decades until this boardgame hit my gaming table, and i enjoyed the game.

Besides it s strenghts (setting, bringing up merchantments, combat`) and beside  the fact that  i played this game for the first time there are some things that hinder the game from getting a 10.

Balancing; the galeon s price versus the fregatte does not seem right for me.
Playing the game in a pirate style the other npcs pirates are pretty senseless.


I still miss some of the Pcs features.

Raiding towns, munity on board, gouveners , stuff like this...

I will get a copy of the expansion for sure.

A strongly thematic game of merchant mariners on the seven seas, where players skirt around Navy vessels that may have it out for them, and pirates - who will attack anyone they think is bad. Do you take on an aggressive role and chase down other players, or do you try and make an honest living buying and selling goods? The choice is yours. The game well done, but might run a bit long for what it has to offer. The combat rules are slightly finicky. Other than that, this is a solid naval sim done in the euro style.

RATING: 9.5
After 1 play with 2 players: 9.5.
This game is long and I can appreciate that there can be downtime with 4 players, but the theme, mechanics and whole experience is tremendous and hits my fav game theme of PIRATES.
The game components are high quality and the rules with examples take a bit of reading but are clear and logically written.
The game play itself is deep and you do have to plan a strategy a few turns ahead to maximise the best cargo/plunder options. The combat with Merchants is fast and against Navies/Pirates/other players becomes clear after the first couple of battles.
After playing with 4 players, I think the downtime between turns becomes noticeable and an issue. With 2 or 3 players the game completes in under 2 hours and is fast. With 4 this is not the case and it really slows the game down. This just means that you need to think carefully how many players you will play the game with before you start.

Really fun game. It is long. It's pick up and delivery, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. Play conservatively early on and you'll be fine. We played with some new players, I told them to run away from the pirates and opposition navies. They didn't listen, got crushed, then complained that the game wasn't good. They were warned. The combat/damage tracks are a fun mini game, but with too many people can slow the game down considerably. I don't mind because I'm always engaged in watching other players sink and burn.

THE Pirate Game. You can plunder gold. You can seek out rumours and missions. 
If you are a pirate, you can fight naval battles with National Fleets. There's war, there's storm, and if all these outlaw lives are too exciting for you, you can choose to be an honest trader, buying and selling goods from port to port. 

But beware, your fellow players may be eyeing your goods, if you are stocking a lot of valuable goods, even an honest trader may consider piracy!

This is a very thematic game. It really makes you feel like you're exploring the Caribbean Sea and making a fortune through questionable means. Ideally you should play it with people who enjoy the theme of being a captain at sea.

Mechanically, it's quite random and often unfair. Sometimes a player is ruined through no fault of their own. You've gotta know how to take a defeat in good humor to enjoy this, because your beloved captain will certainly be killed.

That said, I believe this is the most authentic pirate game on the market. If you want pirates, then this is the game to get. And make sure you buy the expansion too. It's packed with incredible improvements and I could never go back to the base game after trying it.

Un peu trop de temps mort entre les tours, et un facteur chance un peu trop important pour un jeu de cette durée. 

Je n'ai qu'une partie (à quatre joueurs) à mon actif, et possiblement que des joueurs habitués réussissent à jouer plus rapidement...

Il n'y a pas eu aucune attaque entre joueurs, ce qui fait que la seule "intéractivité" avait lieu lorsqu'un adversaire réussissait à modifier la ressource recherchée d'un port...

Un peu déçu aussi de la lenteur de nos déplacements (trois actions par tour) et du mouvement illogique et inconstant des bâteaux pirates ou européens "NPC"; Dans la partie, ces bâteaux européens ont constamment fuit le seul joueur pirate, qui a facilement remporté la partie.

Bref, un très beau design, un thème très présent, une bonne qualité de matériel, mais certaines petites déceptions.

Definitely needs some feeling out after one 4p play. Has some big pacing issues (turns can last anywhere from 2 seconds to 10 minutes). Need more plays to see if this persists.

Pacing is still a problem after a 3p go which took about the same amount of time, though that could have been from having two more newbies at the table and the really rough start we had (one player got sunk by the Pirate Frigate in turn two and I got killed two turns in a row).

Playing this game reminded me a lot of Arkham Horror in some ways.  The way success is determined by dice rolls, the story driven narrative of mission and rumor cards, even the multiple piles of hobbit cards gave me a similar feel, with the change to a pirate theme.  For me that is a good thing.  The game is rules heavy, but fun and has a theme I could enjoy.  The rating may be higher if played with more than two players, but it works fine for me as a 2-player game.

After only one play it seems that frigattes are too weak and you have a very weak chance of winning as a pirate if you start out trying to be a pirate. I have to check to see if we did something wrong, if not, this is not as well balanced as I would have liked.

Edit:
Reread the rules and there's nothing to redeem the fact that some captains are neither good pirates nor merchants.
I got stuck with Frederico 2/4/2/2 and a rumors ability. I tried going pirate, but it seemed that non-pirates simply had a better economy.

http://youtu.be/mTbJgCoUtAc

I think that the captains need balancing, as it was hard for me to attack other ships with any advantage, and going trade-route instead would just have handicaped me compared to captains geared towards this endevour.

Back in the days I was a PlayStation gamer I always loved socalled "free roamer" games such as GTA (I)V and Red Dead Redemption. Well, to me Merchants and Marauders is the very first "free roamer" board game set in the golden age of piracy. Everything what you do (or what you don't do) has its consequences. This game gives you endless possibilities and it may sometimes be a bit overwhelming... but above all it is a wonderful top game with stunning artwork, lots of player interaction and it's about pirates, so what's not to like about this one? Best pirate game I played so far!

The randomness factor is too high for a game that takes at least 3 hours.
You invest too much on your ship and after 2 hours of game you can lose it easily from just a card and after that there is no chance of catching up(in most cases).
I will give it another chance in case I missed something but as I said,there is too much random things happening or left to luck for me to like it..

If it was like pandemic which is one of the most random games I've played but it lasts about 30 mins and you don't invest that much on it, i would be ok with it.
check Rattle, Battle, Grab the loot if you want a pirate game with many dice and a very clever system to use them and it doesn't last that long...
The worst game for me and I didn't expect to find a game i disliked that much cause usually I like all mechanics that make this one... I guess if it took an hour to finish a play I would have another opinion

A solid 9 for me. So many options and paths to obtaining VP, a lot of customization options, 2 very different play styles, NPC's, missions, rumors, trading, sea combats... wow, really a game that feels alive! The game feels a lot like a competitive Arkham Horror on the seas, which is a big plus to me! I'm not rating it higher for now because with 4 player the game takes too much time between player turns.

Fantastic game, pretty lengthy, if the rules on getting glory points from ones in demand are tweaked, so after so many times of x3, it increase to x4.  The amount of glory points required seems like it could be less for a shorter variation.

12/6/2017, after more thought, decreased rating to 6.  Feel like glory points are a little broken.  Really wanted to like this game more, theme comes together very nicely.  Doesn't look like expansion fixes the issue I had.  The expansion does look like a great value for what you get.

This game hits the platonic ideal between cheeky-fun pirates (talking funny, but shallow gameplay) and historically accurate pirates (in-depth gameplay, but not as much fun).  It's Runebound on a boat.  And it's really fun while still feeling dastardly, and yet I'd let my kid play this all he wants.

A really nice,pirate based game.Seems a little bit chaotic at first with the rules,but after a few plays you remember all of them.
the synopsis of rules can be a great help.
The artwork(map cards miniatures) is brilliant,an eye candy if i'm using the right phrase.
the quality of the miniatures though  is the only problem that i can find.
A few of the miniatures were at the verge of breaking.

RATING: 7.6
I have a friend [user=angealv][/user] that says this is a REAL thematic game. And he's right. All the rules are completely logical, they make sense and the reflect the reality quite well. You don't get the sense that any of its rules has been designed in order to keep the balance, or make the game more interesting. But the game is balanced and interesting.

It's the best pirate game I have played. The bits are very nice, the art is too... It's a pity there's no Spanish edition :-(
But it drips with theme and it really manages to involve you into sailing through the Caribbean.

It's a combination of pick up and deliver and combat game, with some luck, light tactic and strategy. The luck component is high, it can be a decissive factor: if you get a capitan with low Influence, the others will rack up points with rumours and missions; drawing 3 cards of a kind at the beginning can be a game winner (1 point + lots of money).

It has a big problem: the downtime between turns. Some turns are very short, but when there are Port actions, you can find yourself waiting during more than 5 minutes with nothing to do.

Some other things I didn't like: 
·) Too long: 3-4 hours for a 4 players game.
·) Frigates seem to be underpowered agains Galleons (yes, I know manoeuvrability is very important, but the difference is huge).
·) Luck factor too high, especially with trading (I understand it's necessary to make trading powerful enough to be a competitive activity).

First impression (4 players): The things in game are rather good. I like theme and stuff you can do during the game. It felt there is rather real decision to go for pirating or more for trading. My only real complain is that the game takes too long. If you could squishe that game experience into half of the time it would be very good.

A game with excellent look of components! Nice ship miniatures, great illustration on the board, nice card, etc. But, too bad, it has too much downtime, and the naval battle sometimes can be a bit too long & bored other players whom not involved. IMO, should use other quicker mechanism to simulate naval battle & crew combat, e.g. card battle à la "Yomi", or hit-and-miss card à la "Bang".

RATING: 5
Played three times, the first two aborted after 2-3 hours.

In the third game, one player won the game by sitting on one port rummaging through cards turn after turn until he had a full boat of exactly what the next port wanted, then sailed over and sold it all.  Repeat going back.  Because the ports were next to each other, the move turn was exit port, move 1, enter port.  Boring but effective.

I wanted so much to like this game but that just ended it for me.

In this game you take the role of a captain/character who starts with a small vessel and  a few crew.  But, the Carribean is your oyster.  From your humble beginnings you can upgrade your ship, or even get a new ship, become a pirate or a peaceful (but well-armed) merchant.  Complete mini-quests, hoard treasure and send your enemies Davy Jones' Locker. 

This game is a wonderful adventure game that offers different strategic paths and a host of tactical issues to consider.  The mechanisms are utterly thematic and the minis and components are very nice.    Each player has their own captain character, with unique stats and abilities.  Some are clearly better as pirates, others as merchants and some could go either way.  It is just plain fun, buying bigger and better ships, upgrading various components, getting special crew members, buying special weapons and completing a variety of mini-quests.  As a pirate, or even as a merchant, you'll be hunted by NPC warships, or even fellow players if they want to risk taking a run at you.  You'll buy and trade cargo at various ports.

You can collect points a variety of ways: hoarding gold, selling volumes of cargo, sinking enemy ships, fulfilling mini-quests and so on.

Most key actions require a bit of luck, but that luck seems manageable.  So the game does rely on risk management skills.  The game is essentially a race to 10 points, so efficiency is also an important skill. Plotting and planning your ship's course carefully will yield points faster and help you avoid getting attacked (unless you want a fight).

The expansion is amazing and adds all kinds of great contents.

There is a solitaire variant here at BGG, which works quite well, because the game already includes rules for non-player ships.

After having played quite a lot of games, I can say that this game is indeed engaging and entertaining, but the rules are not the best in my opinion. Luck plays way too much of a decisive factor, thanks to the number of dices you have to trow each time.

I really enjoyed playing Sid Meyers Pirates on the computer over the years, and this game brings that feel to a boardgame. The game can be a little long at times, and combat (and other actions) are often at the whim of a dice roll, but I will still play it when asked.

Nice components and artwork make for an enjoyable game.

While it felt like the Pirates! game of old on PC, something didn't quite click with me. Too much emphasis on trading and pickup-delivery I think.

Despite being a bit fiddly, questionably balanced, and longer than it needs to be, I still enjoyed this game for what it was: A highly thematic game that lets you play the way you want and still have a chance at winning! However, for the aforementioned reasons, this game has been sold.

Step one. Stop thinking Sid Meiers "Pirates!" even though nobody will deny the obvious link. Once i got that out of my head, the game started working better. This is one of those games that you NEED to play a few times before it sink in. Well, I needed to, at least. 
Step 2. Get your parrot out, and go a-plundering.

Nice and very thematic game, not too long, combat is quite deadly, rumors seem a bit hard/pricey to get, but sometimes they can pay off so handsomely when they turn out to be true.

Comment after three plays.

Piracy doesn't pay off, unfortunately, and in the end, those who were not involved in a player-to-player battle are among the winners. In sum, it comes down to a rather civilized pick up and deliver game. Guys, that is not good. We need more action, dammit! 

Still, it's a thematically sound, but also fiddly game, including a TERRIBLE rule book and a set of rules with a lot of details to memorise. Fine tuned rules are ok with me, but they require a coherent and clear presentation. Too much rules checking required. Also, the game needs some minor tweaking in order to not disappoint the experience during the last few turns.

House rules:
- Getting sunk: -1 point of honour
- PC captains can make auto search for specific opponents in analogy to NPC captains (e.g. try to "block" a harbour for a player)
- fregates 25 gold only

Wide-open sandbox game with great theme, nice looking bits, very smooth feeling play. Don't own this one but I got to play through several times now. I can see the general shape of the game, but I fear it may drag a bit if folks kind of forget what options they have or get hammered too often or too early. 

Interaction is interesting and feels a lot like a way-toned-down version of the Eve MMO: being a pirate is exciting and high-risk, being a merchant means engaging in careful cat-and-mouse and/or decking yourself out for a strong defensive posture. 

I suspect over more play some issues with randomness may crop up. It didn't feel like I could plan much, but on the other hand each turn I felt like I could work toward roughly planned goals -- go trade this stuff at this place, try for a rumor, try for a mission, watch the pirates and navy ships float around, figure out how to dodge. Curious what diplomacy looks like with four engaged players and a full to-the-end play.

Somewhat complex to explain because the game is not linear as it has multiple paths to victory. Lengthy game play as you have to wait for other to complete port interactions or battles. The game is extremely thematic especially in the sea battles. I love the combat in this game as it feels like a real sea battle as you slug it out with your opponent round after round your ships become crippled and deteriorated until one is able to claim victory. I love the pirate theme and all the details but wish the game could be streamline in some areas to speed it up. Best with 3-4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of thematic richness meaning lots of variety, all spiced by lots of luck. Meaning play for the ride, don't be emotionally invested in the result and don't expect Euro sensitivities. See if you get a card? Roll dice. See if the card you just got pays off? Roll dice. Looking to engage in combat? Roll dice. Combat itself? Roll yet more dice in an awkward convoluted rules sequence that takes a touch of gloss off the game. There's lots of variety in the captains you get and these lead you to try different approaches (pick up and deliver, track down cards, seek combat, etc) so there's enough to explore to earn replay. It's just that it's all a little rules awkward and the game kind of inflicts itself on you rather than the other way around.

RATING: 8
Great Adventures in the Caribbean!! Big Fun in a Med-Heavy Med-Sized Square Box. You get a lot of Game here! You have sailing, pirating, missions, trading, looting, ship building, glory seeking, treasure hunting, bounty rewards, cannons firing, crews fighting, storm dodging, booty stashing, rumor chasing, and more. Each game play becomes a different story. Each captain is unique. Each port is unique. It could be overwhelming at first from all the options, but if you plunge right into this one, your inner pirate will truly emerge, and the game will make a lot of sense. Even AP prone players will move along quickly because of how streamlined the game is, and how strong the theme and game are intertwined.

Still, Be Ye Warned! This is not a gateway game: Lots of particular little rules, initial learning curve, and long gameplay isn't for everyone. But for me, as I learned it, I still had fun, and didn't notice the time going by. There is some downtime, but the rules have that another player acts as the Non-player Ships' Captains in battles, and other players turns can feel like it's part of the story unfolding. 

Great Components. Great Artwork! Need a playing surface larger than a card or coffee table. 

This game reminds me of Runebound a bit in feel.
Thank You for this awesome game, My 2011 Dice Tower Secret Santa.

Initally a 'nine', but 5 hour first playtime with 3 players burned everyone out on attempting it again. I have had no real desire to set it up again. Also this is two seperate games: a merchant game, and a pirate game. Doesn't really fit the pirating theme if two players in a 3 player game play merchants and spend every turn doing the same stupid thing: buying and selling and avoiding battles. There is no engagement/battles with other players, which takes all the fun out of it because I play pirate games to have pirate battles against other players not just the NPC's. It's almost solitaire. Rules for battles are hard to explain for newbies and rule book needs constant referencing.

For a high luck game, it's too complex and takes too long to play. Yes, play time could go down on subsequent plays, but first impressions make the most impression so I will have a hard time convincing my wife and limited playing partners to try this again and these are people who actually enjoy playing 'Blackbeard' from Avalon hill. Components are great, but there's a lot of set up time and table space is a priority. 

'Pirate's Cove' (a $4 salvation army find) turned out to be a much better fit for us. It's just as random, but plays much faster (2 hours on first play), components are just as good or better, rules were learned in very short time, and most importantly, has more player interaction. Pirate ship battles between players AND Npc's can happen all the time, and are not things to be avoided. You are still buying and selling your treasures (being a merchant) but you are also FIGHTING like a real pirate should. There's much less fear of battle, and even a reward system for those who retreat. My wife is happy to go into battle now. I love it.

How 'pirates' cove' can be ranked 516 while 'merchants and maruaders' is at 85 is beyond me. I think it's the cult of the 'new' that is keeping this game ranked so highly.

Dopo la prima partita (non terminata), l'idea che mi sono fatto di M&M è sostanzialmente positiva. Un'ambientazione profonda ed estremamente curata (e che materiali!), con un'interazione altissima. Tante navi (e tanti gadget per pomparle) missioni e rumor, e le caratteristiche speciali delle zone di mare rendono il gioco longevo e pieno di sostanza. Poi si può provare a vincere sia da fuorilegge che da onesto mercante (cercando di cambiar mestiere quando cambia il vento).
Qualcosa che mi è piaciuto un po' meno (mi riprometto di aggiornare il commento quando avrò terminato almeno una partita): il dado regna un po' troppo (e un colpo di sfortuna al momento sbagliato può rovinarti una partita), il combattimento mi sembra un po' arzigogolato e il turno di gioco può durare tre secondi come due minuti a testa (vedo quei 180 minuti stampati sulla scatola come eccessivamente ottimistici - partita a tre giocatori che sanno a memoria le regole?).
Non male  comunque: peccato che, per il numero massimo di giocatori e per l'eccessiva durata, sarà difficile rigiocarci di nuovo.

This is a long-ish pick-up-and-deliver game with a combat element.  Players try to get to 10 points by either trading or being aggressive.  The problem is, trading is very low-risk and nets both money and points, where combat (whether with other players or NPCs) tends to yield less money and is incredibly risky--sooner or later, someone is going to lose everything they've earned (except for their points).  So really, the best way to deal with combat is to avoid it, which makes a lot of the "moving parts" of the game seem superfluous.  I can see games where everyone tries to militarily gang up on anyone who goes for a pure merchant strategy, but that sort of emergent behavior certainly won't come out in your first few plays.  On the whole, there are better pick-up-and-deliver games out there, and if you're looking for piratey themes with similar combat mechanics, try Pirate's Cove.

I'm so undecided on whether I actually like this game or not. I might like this game a lot more if I play it 2 player, but I really don't like that turns are so unevenly distributed in terms of game length. I can literally spend 5 seconds on my turn, while my opponents can take 5 minutes. That's not an exaggeration.

Destroying other players ships is a viable strategy, but it effectively knocks you out of the game. After 2 more plays, this will probably be up for trade/sale.

Pirate simulation game, which really resembles the [thing=73447]Sid Meier's Pirates[/thing] video game. It's an action-point allowance game, where players can follow either the merchant or the pirate route, or both, to earn Glory Points. It's very interesting, but extremely heavy and long. Be prepared for a marathon game during your first play; I'd suggest playing a 6-point game to keep it shorter. I would definitely give it another chance, but it's not something I'd play every day.

The tabletop equivalent of Sid Meier's Pirates!
Seas of Glory expansion highly recommended

Plenty of bits to play with.

Players can trade, fight, smuggle, explore, investigate rumours, hunt the  Spanish Treasure Fleet, recruit crew, personalize their ship, buy different ships and loads more.

The only real issue is player interaction or the potential lack of. Unless all players turn pirate it's really unlikely that anyone will be involving themselves in anyone else's game - however, this is slightly negated if one player starts storming up the glory track - in which  case they may find themselves the very centre of attention.

A fun game, some periods of heavy downtime but a few rum and cokes and eye patches and all will come away with some tales to tell down the taverns.

This is a relatively fun-filled game to play.  It is not too complicated except until you get to the ship-to-ship  combat rules, which are unnecessarily convoluted & goofy.  Otherwise, this game is worth playing.  You will have fun.

RATING: 7
One 3-player game only so far.

Fun game with severe down-time (or was it maybe just us not beeing used to the rules the first time playing?)

There is a lot of freedom in choosing your path to glory. And you can actually do a lot of different things to gain points. You can even start as a Merchant and then - if you feel like it - plunder a ship and start taking your chances as a pirate.

Like:
Buying add ons to your ship
The battles between ships
Beautiful lush artwork (well, except for the box cover)
Tension of sailing with lots of gold (should you risk another shipment/plunder nearby or should you cash in in your home port?)
The coffin - what have the others collected: are they going to trigger the end of the game, do I still have a chance of pulling this or that?
Freedom (you are not boxed in in a thight mechanic framework, one of the main things with M&M is not to try to decheffier the system for optimized moves)
As a player you are a certain person (a captain) with certain skills: You can improve somethings by improving your ship, but you still get advantages and disandvantages from the character and you'll have to adopt your play after that (especially when choosing your carrer)

Dislike:
Down time (?)
Its not complex, but there are lots of rules
"Freedom" - the "loose" mechanical framework does not in it self present any challanges. Or rather, it actually does, but it's another kind of challange cause you'll have to play imagniative/more active. (It's a positive thing about the game as well - se above).
Many things boils down to "just" throwing dices (battles, rumours, missions etc) or set collection (GP when shipping, Merchant raids).
The end game can be somewhat of an anticlimax, still the game in it self feels "too long for what it is".

RATING: 10
Such a fun game. The theme is outstanding. We had a blast playing it and the time just flew by.

Pros: 
-Incredible theme
-So many choices and decisions you can make throughout the game
-The luck feature in the game is accurate and to the theme, despite what other gamers say. A huge part of being a captain was dealing with luck. I wouldn't have it any other way.
-High replay-ability due to the sheer number of things that can be done in the game. No two games will be alike
-The board and miniatures are beautiful
-Even better when pirate music is playing in the background and you've got some Caribbean drinks 

Cons:
-The naval combat is very confusing. We're still trying to master it
-It's a long run-time, especially for new players. Be prepared for this to be the only game you play on your game night unless everyone knows exactly what they're doing each turn. Even then, you're looking at at least a two hour run time. But it's so worth it, so this really isn't much of a con
-I wish the game would allow for more players. 5-6 would be great, and just lower the glory point goal amount to keep the run-time the same
-There are so many moving parts and things to remember. This keeps things exciting and fresh, but you'll find yourself forgetting that you had this ability or that card you could have played, but were too busy doing 8 other things to remember it.

Conclusion:
Despite the cons (which really aren't that big a deal), this game is a masterpiece. I recommend everyone pick this up and try it at least once. It's going to take some time to learn and explain, but once you master it, it will probably be one of your favorite games in your collection.

Arrrrgh! Finally, a pirate game that actually feels somewhat piratey. You're basically sailing around, looting ships and selling goods (you have a choice of being a pirate or a merchant.) Game seemed really well balanced... it is just as fun being a merchant or a pirate... and we've found that two-player games are neck & neck. It's a pretty simple game but there are lots of options so it was a little difficult to keep track of all of the choices at first (though it's not as complex as Blackbeard, which had me tearing my hair out.) My favorite pirate game so far.

The definitive pirate themed game. Unlike the rest of the fantasy based pirate board games this is as close to the real thing as you are going to get. I highly recommend the modular expansion "[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161167/merchants-marauders-seas-glory]Seas of Glory[/url]" which greatly improves the base game in so many ways. Complaints about randomness and luck are mitigated with the favors expansion. While complaints about stashing gold are solved with the "Give Me Glory or Give Me Death" variant.

Pros:
* Extremely high production value.
* Quality components with a beautiful game board.
* Multiple paths to victory.
* Sandbox environment - do you want to be a merchant, pirate or a mix of both?

Cons:
* [b]-.5 for the inclusion of female pirate captains which is unrealistic in a non-fantasy game - removed from game.[/b]
* Player boards should include holes to prevent cubes from moving.
* Player boards should include a separate location for your gold.
* Player boards should include a separate location for your glory cards. (Added in the Seas of Glory expansion)
* Pirate characters should be chosen by limited selection not distributed randomly. (Variant added in the Seas of Glory expansion)
* Small cards are hard to shuffle.
* Minimum 3 hour game.

RATING: 7
After playing this I see I'm a fan of pick up and deliver games as I like being a merchant and avoiding the dice based combat (though this luck is mitigated someone-what through ship upgrades). Really enjoy this game, fun to try to accomplish tasks like rumors and missions while trying to get lucky picking up in demand goods (which is random too, but doesn't involve the stresses associated with attacking another player).  Also fun with just two as the non-player characters bring welcome tension to the proceedings when just playing as merchants.  Like this game, just rated it a 7 as there are other games I'd rather play as I don't find myself wanting to get too physical in the game and pick up and delivery is not something I'm always in the mood for.  My score is more of a personal issue and less a problem with the game.  Pretend I put a score of 8 here and get the game, it's worth adding to your collection -- awesome artwork, theme and miniatures, it's a game people stop to see what you are playing at game night because it looks so cool.  The visual appeal really adds to the fun.

There's some fun in this one, but there's so much randomness  that it proves a bit tedious at times.  There's also no balancing element, so that if one player gets ahead, you're never going to catch her.  Turns can also drag if someone wants to do everything during a port turn. 3-player is a bit more streamlined, but 4 can be a downright drag.

This is a game you do not play to win, it's a game you play to experience. The wild swings of luck in the last two turns of my first game took me from a distant third to a runaway leader (a lucky die roll) to a distant third again (one event card). Kingmaking opportunities abound, some of the rules are unclear and the rulebook isn't the best for learning the game, but it is an experience. Just make sure you set aside enough time to play (3-4 hours) if you don't have someone in your group who knows all the rules cold.

Certainly one of the best pirate games out there. Components are all really nice. I worry though that it's better to play as a pirate than as a merchant, if you want to have a chance at victory. Plays well enough with 2 players, but it likely shines with a few more.

Ok, second play with 2 pirates and one merchant.  Incredibly tight game between 2 of the 3 players.

Fabulous game.  Beautiful and immersive.  Still very long but if you expect it then it is ok.

Enjoying playing using solo rules.  The game becomes a race against the clock.  The games plays a lot faster with one player which gets it to the table a lot more.  Also, who cares if I win or lose as the story created is so great :)

Awesome pirate-themed adventure game similar in feel to something like Runebound (though a little shorter & lighter on rules).

The cards work well to keep things unpredictable, the different ship/captain abilities permit different styles of play, and the way the dice & counters work during naval combat matches the theme very well (maneuvering for position, cannon firing, and use of grapeshot & chainshot).

Appears to be plenty of replay value given the number and variety of cards, and the various different approaches you can take.

Component quality is ok, but all the cardboard components appear to have some kind of thin waxy/plastic coating that can tear and/or peel if not careful. It looks like the same stuff used in "Duel in the Dark". Unfortunately, the factory-packed box allowed the ships to poke into the game board leaving dents!

Rules are reasonably written, but there are a lot of important pieces of information in the wrong place, with not even a reference to them. It reminds me of the style of FFG rules - nicely-written, but in conceptual order rather than in play-sequence. While learning, this leaves you flicking between multiple pages just to ensure you haven't missed anything when performaing a simple action. One simple example (there are many more), why isn't the "flip the face-down ship mod token" rule included as the first port action in the bulleted list? Instead, it is buried under the "buy ship mod" section.

Similarly, the summary cards are decent, but have a few vital pieces of information missing. Would not recommend playing a first game by relying on them to remind you of all the major rules & sequences of actions.

Still, the game plays great once you've got the rules sorted!


WARNING: Biggest problem experienced is with 2 players, a predominantly-merchant player seems to easily outscore a predominantly-pirate player at a rate of at least 2:1, especially if they start at opposite ends of the board (making for the pirate to interfere before the merchant gets established). Really need to ensure we're playing correctly, study pirate strategy and maybe look for variants.

Some suggestions to aid pirate players include...
- NPCs move 2 sea zones & can hunt instead of each of those moves
- limit number of points allowed from each source (battles, stash, rumours, missions, etc.)
- reduce cost & sale price of frigate (or increase those of galleon)
- reduce number of cargo cards drawn by 1 (eg. from usual 6 cards down to 5 cards)

It wouldn't be as challenging now but I'm a bit swamped trying to catch up with all my mplayed games so it'll have to wait.

Sid Meier's Pirates faithfully and efficiently translated into a board game. The game encapsulates the theme well, but has a bit too much luck for such a long game. This is true both in that lucky/unlucky draws for merchant raids and shopping for goods can have an enormous impact on the game and also in ship combat, where your entire game can rest on the roll of a couple d6s. Players really need to understand the level of luck involved when they go into the game so they're prepared to laugh off an unlucky roll leading to the death of their pirate and no hope at winning the game.

What's not to like about this game, I mean, if you like pirate stories, eh? If this game can't make you feel yourself an evil pirate, no other will.

Not only that, but some missions and rumors are specially fun...
For you see, sometimes somebody gotta do something that isn't exactly necessary except you really need to do that, specially if it's just barely possible to be gone without doing it first, ye know, like when a bottle of run make you do things that are not really being done, so that you're doing some other thing you don't really know about - but then again, maybe you're not even really doing that, but doing some other thing instead which is already something, savy?

Now back to work ye scurvy rats! (Now whait! That's another game!)

The theme is awesome, and really comes across in the gameplay for me.  Multiple paths to victory, gorgeous components, the Glory cards give a fair number of Ah Ha! and Oh No! moments, and there's plenty of random to go around.

My one minor quibble would probably be with how common/seldom player interaction can be directly, but a lot of that is on the players as well, and there is an optional rule to alleviate the major part of the concern.

I respect this game because it perfectly fulfills its purpose. This game makes you feel like you're a pirate. It doesn't have the deepest strategy or the clearest rules or the quickest pace, but it does well enough in each of those categories, and none of that matters if you think the idea of being a pirate who goes around around searching for treasure and smashing enemy ships and looting everything is awesome. You get to do all sorts of cool pirate things that other games either don't include or implement via awkward and/or broken mechanics, and you won't find anything awkward or broken in this game. The production value is also through the roof, which is nice to see. In the end, this game will sink or swim based on how much you like the theme; if you think you'd like this game, you will, and if you think you won't, you won't.

This is a great game.  It is real gamey and not a simulation of pirates.  The characters have no names that I recognize, too bad, that would have made it more fun.  But it captures the fun or sailing around as a merchant and then deciding when to become a pirate, if ever. Great theme.

You pick up cargo, deliver cargo, fight off naval ships and pirates, which have a mind of their own.  Pirates hunt any non pirate and naval ships hunt pirates.  Real nice.

The game is colorful, components attractive, and rule book is pretty good.  Didn't have to come to boardgamegeek to understand the rules, which means the rules are pretty light and easy to figure out.

All in all an addictive game that captures the fun, not the simulation, of being in the Caribbean during the golden age of pirates.  

Just finished playing solo with 4 characters.  2 of the characters I played as pirates and 2 as merchants.  

Here are some problems.  I would definitely get the expansion, Seas of Glory as it cleans up some of the balance and adds a lot more things to do.  In fact, that is one of the problems.  There is way to much to do.  Lots of ways to win, but if you go for the win quickly, you will miss so much of the game.  I wanted to slow it down a lot so I could enjoy all the things I could do and even then I couldn't do as much as I wanted. I really enjoyed exploring the game and then when I got everybody up to a good level and had seen a lot, I went for the win, and it went pretty quick after that.  A great advantage to playing it solo.

When you become a pirate, you limit your choices to make money and such.  Playing a pirate is a lot harder but you do get to attack a lot more.  That takes time and may not get you any victory points, whereas the merchants can just roll along.  Some of the pirates bots are pretty weak too, making it easier for the merchants.  One of my pirates went back to being a merchant because they were not getting much done.  I would strengthen up the pirate players and somehow strengthen up the pirate bots.

So I made up some house rules to make the game more fun for me.  See the files section for those rules.

All in all, a strong 8, but with my rules a stronger 9.  Nothing is perfect but this game is a lot of fun to play.

*sigh* I just don't see this game ever getting to the table. I should just trade it away or sell it.

I paid $60+tax for the game and sleeved all of the cards in premium sleeves (which I will not be removing. They were a tight fit). So I've sunk over $70 into this.

Anyway, feel free to make an offer. It's heavy so shipping won't be cheap.

Sandbox feel like Sid Meier Pirates! However, there's lots of downtime while player is in the ports. If the player has further actions, then a solution is to ask the player their intent is to remain or to come back out so that the next player can take their turn. 

I play with the Cutthroat variant modifying the Galleon with the cost of $40, maneuverability to 1, and crew of 0. Despite these distractions, my friends overwhelmingly still choose to get the Galleon and hunt pirates (aka. other players with bounty) for end game victory.

Played it again for the first time in years. I forgot how good this game was. Absolutely phenomenal design - not necessarily because it is mechanically tight (it is not), but because it is intuitive and extraordinarily well-paced. I don't think it works as well for deeply competitive play, but it is great fun as a swashbuckling experience.

Will be breaking this out again more often.

Christmas 2010 gift.  

I love playing this title for so many reasons.  There are enough cards, ships and captains to try so many different things.  You can play from beginning to end with only one captain and win, you can cycle through a few different captains and ship types and also win while using contrasting merchant or pirate styles.  

You can battle NPC military ships (which are usually very hard and briefly manned by another player), you can raid NPC merchants which are usually much easier targets for acts of piracy.  Then there is Hunting Player pirates or playing the pirate and raiding other players.  The options within a game, just never seem to cease!

Alternatively you can be an honest merchant or a ship for hire performing a myriad of missions.  You can be adventurous and prove or disprove rumors picked up ship ports.

You can play quite quickly 2 1/2 to three hours or longer games running four to six hours by simply not capping the Glory track to ten; its quite flexible.

We prefer to play with the cut throat beta proposed by Christian.

An excellent well-rounded system of game mechanics. I don't usually like pick-up and deliver games, but this flows smoothly enough and fits the theme so well. Love the choice to be merchant or pirate. Seems it's usually best to have a careful mix of both. Combat is quick and fun. Having the board controlled ships hunting players with bounties is always exciting. Just a great game overall.

Merchants & Marauders is an experience.  It is one of the first boardgames I have ever played that makes it feel as if there is a little world playing out before you as player and NPC ships sail about the board attempting to further their goals.  Honestly, between the event cards and watching the ships, I felt a level of immersion I use only feel in RPGs or videogames.

Now, the question is, do you like immersion in theme? If you do, and you like pirates, you should get this game immediately. 

There are a lot of die rolls that can screw you over - and the mission cards are unbalanced - and the glory cards vary widely in power level.  But you know what? I don't care, because it all *works* together to make it seem like you are a pirate (or merchant) on the high seas.

I likely wont get to play this one *quite* as much as I would like because it does take several hours to play (at least 2 and a half to 3 and a half for a 4 player game), but I understand that in a game with as much stuff going on as this one has, it has to take a while.

Positives: 
    -Wonderful immersive pirate theme
    -Ship combat is a lot of fun
    -Very nice components (especially the ship miniatures and the treasure chests)
    -Has lots of depth and replay value in my opinion
    -Is easily modded to your tastes if you so choose
    -Is well supported by its creator, Mr. Marcussen, who seems to be a really nice guy :)

Negatives:
    - If you are opposed to dice rolls you won't like it, but if you *are* opposed to dice rolls, why did you play it anyway? :)
    - Longish playing time (but worth the time investment!)

*UPDATE - I'm bumping my score up to 7. Even though it's fiddly, chaotic and slow, it's still more fun and more epic than the other games I've rated 6 on BGG.*

If you want a highly thematic piracy game that's fiddly and random, this is it.

The randomness doesn't only influence your success. It also constantly changes your individual objectives, which unfortunately creates a feeling of 'the game playing you'.  On the plus-side, it means frequent, sometimes fun, tricky decisions.

It has excessive bookkeeping. Players are constantly checking that they haven't forgotten to activate a range of things described on random cards. They also have their own hand of text-filled cards and other tokens that they must try to remember to activate at the right time. It's almost inevitable that you'll forget things. The expansions add even more things into the game that need to be managed.

The downtime between turns is high, which is why I prefer to play this as a two-player game.

Unlucky players can find themselves in almost irrecoverable positions very early in the game, especially if a luckier player acquires a massively upgraded ship and decides to blast them back to the start of the game (the map also spawns non-player enemy ships that can do the same). It annoys me that one of the expansions add a Loyalty track which can let you travel further around the map in order to attack another player, which basically means unlucky players become constantly threatened and limited in what they can do.

The above problems are a shame because the individual elements are great. It has all the variety and events you could want in a pirate game and you DO feel invested in your ship. Importantly, the combat is also fun.

If you have the patience of a buddhist monk you probably won't notice it dragging and will think it's the ultimate pirate game.

Personally, I'm getting a bit bored with these giant sandboxy games that have tons of fiddly and slightly 'meh' decisions i.e. the many dull Cthulhu/Lovecraft games. Yet I keep coming back to Merchants & Marauders because it has enough fun elements and such magnificent theme.

Don't mistake this for a eurogame. It has real combat, customizable ships, and all sorts of mechanically-support theme in the variety of locations and captains.

Looks as though it will take some experience to play a marauder well enough to win. And those who don't want to stray from optimizing point generation will probably play a pretty straightforward game. This game works if the players are willing to dip their toes in the waters of chaos and conflict and have some fun.

An unusual miss from Z-Man games. This is overly fiddly and too long. That isn't to say that a pirate game, dodging British frigates and raiding Spanish merchants isn't fun - it is.

13/06/2013 - Changed rating from 6.9 to 7.5.  For some reason can't stop thinking about this game.  Would really like to play it again.

After 1 play : really like the trading in the game, although we went through the cargo deck rather quickly and repeatedly in our 4 player game.  Perhaps there should be more?  There are some very nice mechanics which add to the theme, but felt the combat wasn't one of them.
Personally, think there may be some house rules out there which would mitigate some aspects of the combat which felt clunky.

Wonderful game!  Rich in theme and options to go for victory.  There is a lot going on and so many pieces and cards that I can see why many would say its fiddly.  However...the truth of the matter is that the theme requires all the options and cards/pieces.  It was tough teaching my wife the game since there were so many rules going on, but once she got a grasp of the rules she really enjoyed herself.  Looking forward to playing this one again.

Setup time is a drawback though.  First game was easily 2hrs+ but our second game was down to 90min.

Painting the minis would ramp up the quality of the game.

(+) Nice components
(+) The game offers some nice decisions you can make to change the course of the game

(-) This game requires tactical and strategic planning, but in the end it all boils down to luck-driven elements like card draws and dice rolls. It is a luck-based game wrapped in the illusion of a deep strategic game. To me there is little point in strategic planning if the core of the game is purely luck-based. I very much dislike this aspect
(-) It takes way too long to explain the game
(-) The game feels too heavy for a luck-driven game
(-) The text printed on the map is unclear

A delightful game that is unfortunately a bit too rules heavy for many people to really enjoy that crucial first game. It's not complex per se, there is just so many things you can do. Two - three really - different modes of battle. Like 7-8 different actions you can perform in a port. And on top of that every space on the board has it's own special rule (printed on the board, thankfully). I love it - I really do - but I can see how it might feel a little overwhelming at first..

There is also tons of luck involved with the dice. I've gone from "okay, just sail back to my home port and it's a wrap" to being sunk on the way, and then having 5 other captains die on me in my mad scramble to get back in the race, before losing by a mile. So if that sounds terrible, you probably won't like it!

Everyone seems to really like this game. I do not. The theme is cool, the board and bits are beautiful, but for reasons I have a hard time quantifying, I am just not a fan of the game. I guess what it comes down to is, there are other sort of adventure style games I'd rather get out over this one.

Pirates isn't really my bag, either. That may be part of the issue.

An experience game where I am enjoying the various items hidden in the mission, rumour, and event decks.  Much of the rating now is from this joy of discovery as we learn how to get the system running smoothly.  But then again, I like Arkham Horror for the same sense of experience and discovery - this one just has a nice pirate/merchant theme.  Pretty streamlined processes for the various activities (plundering merchants, naval combat, and NPC's) so enjoying this as an immersive experience game rather than any in depth simulation of pox and scurvy.

First plays were rather long as we all got a handle on the games rules, but everyone is asking for this to hit the table again as we expect our moves will be much quicker with experience.

Rated after first play. 

I like the game. I like the customization of captain/ship. I like that you can retire your captain.. I like the encounters with pirates. I like that you can choose to be a pirate or merchant. I only regret that you can buy off your bounty so poorly, since I think it'd be more thematic if boundaries between pirate and merchant were a bit more fluid.

I did not realize the ALL-importance of sea-mastery. I rolled one die versus 3 of my opponent in determining which action we got to take. Needless to say, I lost the fight horribly and ultimately the game based on that encounter.

The thing I like least about the game is the long downtime between turns. I think I would play this game with 3, instead of 4 next time.

RATING: 5
Dripping with piratey theme goodness, but I was not super excited about it after the first game, especially for a 3+ hour game, and I definitely would prefer to play Merchant of Venus, which has just as much theme but is a purer pick-up and deliver game. I would be interested in trying this again with just 2 players; anymore than that and I'll pass.  I particularly don't like the 3 actions per turn mechanics, which makes movement around the board very deterministic (I also complain about getting screwed by the dice in Merchant of Venus, but there are upgrades to mitigate this if you want to invest, whereas there's no way in M&M to move faster).  I think I would have liked it better if there was more of a historical component, with real history about how different countries went to war and hunted down privateers, eliminate any player vs. player attacking (this was never a popular mechanic in the original MoV), and simplify the combat mechanics.

Update: After 2 solo games and a 2p game, I am lowering the rating.  I do not want to play it again.  Battle is so tedious when it does occur (which we avoided as much as possible) - Pirate's Cove and Winds of Plunder do battle and ship arms race dynamics much better. And what M&M is pretty good at - pick-up and deliver - is done much better by Merchant of Venus.

Although it is a long game, I really love this game.  Some in my group complained about how it is hard to successfully pirate right from the beginning, but to me that makes sense.  You start with a little ship with no upgrades, and you think you should be able to just go out and hunt other ship and collect tonnes of money?

Anyways, one of my favourite purchases so far.  I gave it an 8 instead of a 9 due to the huge time commitment and a bit of randomness in the dice, but it is an otherwise awesome game.

Ameritrash or whatever they call it, I like that type of game, about experiencing other than calculation. It's just another style of play. Besides, I love navigation background, not quite familiar with the Caribbean, though. This game offers me a good chance to learn the Caribbean. As to mechanics, well, the biggest problem is the lack of weaker player protection. Very important to keep player staying interested after being plunderred heavily, isn't it?

Love how this game (and the designer's continued presence on the forums) has sparked such creativity.

I'm definitely agnostic about the game. Trading seemed less fun, but an easier path to victory, making the game too much like Valdora but with the occasional battle. While I'm not worried about the luck, it was just that my decisions seemed to be based on the luck I had, rather than that I made a decision and then threw the dice to find out whether it succeeded (though that happens as well).

I'll play again, but it didn't grab me.

Production values are good. Great theme. However combat is VERY fiddly and is complicated by recalling the availability of special characters, Captain abilities and ship equipment and armaments.

I agree with the general sentiment that pirates in this game seem to have a significantly tougher go of it than merchants. I will admit, however, that this is likely due to my inexperience and my small number of plays through the game. Despite this very small wrinkle in my merchants and marauders experience, I find the game highly enjoyable. The combat mechanisms balance chaos with true risk-management and clever tactics, and I really appreciate the "NPC" ships - they strongly emphasize the consequences of your choices. The port actions are wonderful in their strong thematic grounding (I am speaking primarily of the "rumor" option - what a fun action to visualize and carry out!), and everything comes together to make for a rich pirate experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very flavorful, and at heart it wants to be a simulation of everything that involves pirates. Too bad that the game, in itself, suffer greatly of the runaway leader problem. Once the luck of the first plays has made some player even slightly more powerful than the others, there are nigh to 0 reason to not hunt for those weaker ships and send them to the bottom. While recover from an early death is possible, and it's fun and flavorful in the process, to catch up with the winning players is simply not feasible. Maybe a simpler, shorter, but more balanced game would have been better for those who like flavorful game but can't simply let go of their competitive side.

Clearly fun and rather complex, in a good way. Lots to do, and varied routes to victory. I usually don't have any problems with rulebooks, but in this case there seemed to be many small exceptions and special cases, so it took a session to "get" the game.

With time, my enjoyment of M&M has gone down a bit. Still a good game, but I think I've filled my quota of playing it. A nice (long) filler, but it wouldn't be my top choice for a gaming night anymore. I just feel there are similar(-ish), better titles out there I'd rather play instead. I felt this most clearly when we picked up M&M after an unusually quick game of SeaFall. M&M just didn't quite live up to my memory of how good it was.

I don't really like adventure games, but I love M&M. I guess it's partly the theme and how well mechanics reflect it, and partly that it's just great fun to play. The great thing about is (apart from excellent production) is the plurality of career choices. There's no clear cut between being a pirate and a merchant, but instead you get bounties for every act of piracy from the nation against which you transgressed. A pirate's life might be tempting, but when naval ships start to track you and you are banned from visiting a port for repairs, you might regret it. Even more so, that some of the missions you can claim or rumours you can investigate will be unavailable for you.

Contrary to what a geekbuddy of mine said, this IS the Sid Meier's Pirates! game that you were looking for! With this game you experience a story, you have a narrative and it is nail-biting exciting to go against a man-o-war and win, barely alive. The multitude of options available to to gain points and explore the story are truly awesome. I want to play this game all the time.
 
Nonetheless there are some minor things I don't like, probably because I haven't figured them out yet. 
* Other players playing a merchant are annoying and lame. It's the accountant tactic of winning this game and I wonder, if we should make it mandatory for every player to have at least one bounty from any one nation.
* The rumours and the missions are cool, and I would like to do them more often, but it seems very rarely that you get the chance to do one of them. 
* The Specialists are cool, but I need to pay more attention to them. 
* There need to be more things happening. The first time we played wrong and we had an event card whenever a player took his turn. There were a lot of frigates and pirates in the water and we saw a lot more action. Last time we almost only drew storms, which are a bit boring, because they only limit your turns. 

So, my heart says '10', my gut says '7', so I go with a [b]'9'[/b] in the end.

It's not a very strategic game and there is much luck envolved - but I still like this game very much! It's very thematic in a positive way!

The great thing is, that with each rule and mechanic, you see what the developer wanted to depict by it. In some games this leads to an overwhelming number of rules, but with this game it really works well.

RATING: 6
Full of fun and flavour, but with a few gaps in the rules that need to be filled with logic. Very dependent upon who you're playing with. It tends to fall flat with players who don't want to act a little pirate(y) and instead play like polite peace loving dullards. A little aggression and biffo makes it a lot more fun. So I found it fun to play with children - they get the idea - if you see an opportunity to pinch stuff you should usually go for it. With the right crowd this rates at least a point higher.

I find the game nicely balanced between merchant actions and piracy. You pick your battles, where you want to fight them and against who you want to fight. The game has a clever bounty system where you deal with the consequences of aggressive actions for a quick buck or to stop another player just from making off with a pile of spoils. It's clever, it's interactive and with players who know the rules the port visits and combat run along at a nice pace. That said I prefer to play with three players to keep the game moving quickly and coming in at under two hours. (What's all this about port actions taking too long? Sell, buy, maybe rumour roll, maybe fix ship. The whole shebang takes about 30 seconds.)

There's luck in the cards and dice rolls, but all that is acceptable because there's plenty of cards and plenty of dice rolls. It's about the fun and it delivers.

Too long and complicated for what it finally is: A pick and deliver game with some battles thrown in.  Not a bad game, just not as good as its hype. If you are not deep in the pirate mood, you will be OK if you just pass on this one.

Wonderfully thematic game that gets sunk (pun intended) by one unfortunate aspect of its mechanics, namely the plethora (and thus time-consuming) possible actions to take in the harbors. Unless you do not mind twiddling your thumbs during long periods of downtime, avoid playing this with anyone suffering from analysis paralysis, or its close cousin, the player who is unable to plan or think ahead during other players' turns.

New reigning king of pirate games.  If it had Han Solo and the Kessel Run I'd buy it in a second, but I'm lukewarm on the theme as is.

UPDATE (Nov 2012): I'm pretty convinced the Galleon and Frigate are not balanced with each other, and I think piracy could use a bit of help - so I'm officially searching for a good thematic Galleon nerf.

This game looks wonderful. It has very good parts, it's dripping with theme with a lot of interesting mechanics, very exciting.
On the other hand, it's quite oldschool. A game lasts for 3 hrs+, it's very random, you can get your ass kicked pretty bad by both the game and other players. And that's ok by me.
The big problem with this game is the large amount of downtime. When other players become belligerent, you can wait for as much as 15 min between turns and that's an absolute no-no for me.

RATING: 7.5
I don't want to damn with faint praise but the best I can say about this one is - not bad. It looks good - the rules seem fairly easy to grasp and apply - BUT. The game is quite fiddly - there can be an awful lot of downtime between turns, and I'm not completely happy about this stashing rule, which enables a player currently on 4 points to suddenly win immediately due to winning 1 more point and adding his stash. (Even though that's how I won the only game I played.) 

I don't want to say I dislike the game - I might play it again but won't be looking hard for the opportunity to do so. It's certainly a game of an appropriate quality such that I would recommend trying it out at least once - the theme works well and I can see that many gaming groups might make this a favorite, but it's not exactly my cup of tea, and too much downtime would be my main criticism.

RATING: 10
This is the board game that's given me the closest thing to a feeling of roleplay, in spite of never getting into Sid Meier's Pirates (though it satisfies the Grand Theft Auto itch! And definitely Assassin's Creed Black Flag now that I've played the video game) or even roleplay itself. Mechanisms are simple, just action points, but everything is dressed up in a rich way that made me care. I was totally bummed when my pirate died.

The killer app in the game is the merchant/pirate duality and the sandbox/freedom to make your own choices. 'Morality' is all the rage in video games nowadays, and this one gives heavy consequences for choosing a life forever on the run. Be an inefficient merchant, stuck at least every other turn adrift at sea, or be a pirate, getting to conduct both a port action and steal cargo from merchant ships, but be able to survive the target on your back and the hostility of ports that no longer welcome you. It's easy to switch from a merchant to a marauder, but when should you do it, if at all?

This feels like a 9 right now, but should settle between 8-10. 5 things hold me back:

1) Will other games play out in the same 2-3 general themes (barring some random luckiness): be a pirate and hope the naval ships take a while to mobilize; or wait for a Galleon before being violent. The sheer number of cards in the game and possible combinations gives me optimism. Old-school Z-Man hasn't balked at cramming the box with tons of cards which you only use a few of in games like this and Earth Reborn to add variety and unpredictability. This, along with Mage Knight, puts Fantasy Flight's usual 10-20 play crop of cards to shame.

2) [-]The Event deck was pretty boring.[/-]

3) Glory cards reinforce runaway-leader syndrome. Maybe these balance the fact that early leaders get targeted, but I'm not sure you can target players effectively this game, especially if their early lead gets them a ship upgrade quickly.

4) Game could drag with the wrong group. You can spend many consecutive turns grinding and not doing anything meaningful, and that would be a frustrating time if other players bog down in AP.

5) Biggest gripe: player vs. player conflict appears to be dominoes/pile-on. Nobody dares to initiate, then when it happens, whoever wins is so wounded that the other players swoop in for the kill. Maybe lower rewards (don't give the Glory Cards to the victor for a successful boarding too!), decrease the penalty of starting over, or tweak battles so that the luckily targeted loss of any non-Cargo stat doesn't cripple your ship.

6) With 4) and 5) taken together, there isn't much direct interaction, with gameplay often being do your own stuff, then watch others with interest. If watching others gets old, it'd make the non-me time (2/3 or 3/4, or longer if others have AP) a killer.

Based on what I've heard of the expansion, I feel confident it'll address some of the base-game issues (e.g. Galleons) and push this to a 10.

3er was fine, but 4er felt better (in spite of more downtime) because the board got more crowded and incubated conflict in a more natural manner than the PvP scouting rule variant. Maybe that variant is still necessary for 3er.

5+5

So, I finally got to play the physical embodiment of what I always thought Sid Meier's Pirates could be.  It's a good game that makes me think of Arkham Horror on the high seas.  Many gamers might give this an 8 at best, but the theme appeals to me strongly.  A couple of major drawbacks are the teaching time for people that are not familiar with the PC game as there are a lot of elements to explain as well as the play time as not everyone wants to play a 3-hour game.  I think that this game improves with more players as well as the cutthroat variant mentioned by the designer as it prevents the merchant characters from scurrying from port to port without threat of harm.  All in all a good game, but not one of my top 10 - at least for now.

Playing it again at Lobster Trap, I have seen how important it is to play it more frequently so you remember the flow of play.  It can bog down if folks aren't familiar with what can be done.  Still a solid, fun game dripping with theme and I hope that playing it recently will get it to the table more frequently.

It's Sid Meier's Pirates as a boardgame and it captures the feeling well. Some rules are nicely done.

But unfortunately, it's a boring game: There is not much to think about between turns, no strategic planning and decision making and suprisingly little player interaction. It is more of a randomness driven pirate adventure game that reminds me of Talisman. But Talisman plays fast, this one is cumbersome, there's a lot of administrative counter moving to do and PvP combat is unforgiving and almost pointless.

RATING: 8
Very cool game about trade and piracy in the Caribbean. It feels like the heavy Euro daddy to DoW's light game Pirate's Cove. It's action driven, so in theory the game plays fairly quickly, but I think the first game is definitely a slow learner's game. You need to get a feel for how trading works to make money, how ship combat works, pros and cons of piracy vs trading and how the different captain skills affect the different parts of the game, etc.

We really enjoyed the the "open world" feel of the game. Despite playing on a map with only 17 spaces, the presence of naval ships from the four colonial powers, the effects of war on where you can port, deciding when to go pirate and upon which nation to prey, etc. all felt "big" to me. Some players sailed long distances to make desirable sales, some ran away from hostile ships. I spent the last part of the game jumping from port to port trying to avoid the powerful pirates around me.

I'm really looking forward to playing again now that we've seen the game in action once.

This is another one I may regret trading away, but I didn't see it coming to the table at home.

Arrr, matey.  If you like piratey games, this one is a must have for your collection.

Highly recommended.

Nagyon nagy népszerűségnek örvendő játékot nagy várakozással próbáltam ki, csalódni nem csalódtam, de nem is éreztem elsöprő érzést. A játékosok kereskedőként indulnak a játékban, de később, ahogy drága árukat szállító hajókat látnak meg kalózokká válhatnak. Valószínűleg csak kereskedőként nehéz a játékban a nyerés, de talán nem lehetetlen. Több fajta hajónk lehet a játékban, de talán túl egyértelmű melyik a legjobb hajó így maximum egy váltáson esünk át a játék során, hacsak háború nem tör ki. A hajócsaták mechanizmusa jól megoldott. Nagyban függ a szerencsétől, hisz kockadobások sorozata, de azért a jobb kapitány, jobb hajó nagy előny. És itt az egyik buktató, a jó kapitány. Ezt a játék elején sorolással kapjuk és közben nem lehet változtatni. Egy-egy kapitány jól behatárolja, hogy a játékosnak mire kell mennie, különben nem sok esélye van. A játék kivitele szép, sokat dobnak a műanyag hajók is rajta. A játék fő erénye számomra a téma szinte tökéletes megvalósítása. Játék közben érezni, hogy valaki kalózként, hogy próbál menekülni az esetleges erősebb nemzetek hajói elől, próbál kereskedőket elkapni és csencselni. Érdekes és változatos az egyes kikötők előnyei, amelyek a hajózásra késztetik a játékost. Jól kigondolt a játék, jól adja vissza a kalózkodás érzését. A baj nálam három dologban jelentkezik. Először is a magas nyelvfüggőség. Minden kártyán szöveg, nem is kevés, hosszú összefoglalók, városok, különböző fejlesztések szövegei. Nagyon sok szöveg. Ezek persze mind a beleélést hivatottak segíteni, de azok számára, akik nem perfektek angolból inkább negatívan hatnak. A másik dolog a szerencsefüggőség magas volta. Érdekes módon annyira nem vettem észre a játékom során, mert nagyon jókat dobtam végig. De belegondolva sok minden múlt a jó dobásokon. Zavaró a kapitány véglegessége. És a játék legnagyobb baját hagytam a végére, az iszonyatos holtidőt. Egy játékos akár mozoghat, csatázhat és kikötőbeni tevékenységet is folytathat a körében, ami nagyon elnyúlhat. Négy játékos esetén 1 óra szabálymagyarázat után több, mint 4 óra volt a játék és én még pörgettem is. Akár jóval tovább is elhúzódhatott volna. Jó játék a M&M, érhető is a népszerűsége, mert jó adja vissza témát, de nálam a hosszú holtidő rontott az összképen, de kap majd még esélyt.

[2012-05-19]
Megkapta az esélyt, egyet rontok a ponton. Nagyon jó téma, jó megvalósítás, de a három kellemetlen dolog megvan. Nagyon magas holtidő, négy játékosnál nagyon hosszú játékmenet, pedig próbálja a játék rövidíteni magát azzal, hogy a győzelemhez szükséges pontok felét aranyból be lehet szerezni és nem is nehéz 50 aranyat összeszedni a játékban. Nagy nyelvfüggőség és legnagyobb bajom talán a nagy szerencsefaktor. A jó arány nincs eltalálva ez esetben. Tehát, hogy túl komoly és hosszú a játék ilyen magas szerencse mellé. Némi apróság még, hogy igazából 5 fajta hajó van, abból egy csak különleges eseménykor szerezhető az alapból választható kettő után pedig a fejlesztéskor vehető kettő közül teljesen egyértelműen az egyik erősebb, mint a másik így nincs választás. Tehát ebben nincs igazán változatosság. Nagyon könnyű elsüllyeszteni valakit, akinek így kb. véget is ér a játéka, tehát effektíve nem lehet kiesni, de gyakorlatilag onnantól vegetál csak a megsemmisített játékos.

RATING: 9
Best with 4 players.

Absolutely in love with the theme. What a neat game. I should play it more but it seems to be far and away best with 4 players which easily increases the length to 3 hours or more, and there is very stiff competition in the 3+ hour game category. It also feels pretty satisfying -- like something you always have fun with, but you don't feel the need to play too often.

One thing I've found is that every player needs to be in to the theme for full enjoyment, otherwise downtime during the port "action" and the battles can seem like a lot. Personally I don't mind, because I'm so into the pirate theme that I'm as genuinely interested in the fate of the other players as I am my own!

This game has beautiful, fun components, and a generous amount of cards for an unexpanded game. Still, I'd love to see more variety (and NPC movement) in the event deck, as it could be the source of a lot more fun and excitement if it were more varied.

Pretty much a perfect game IMO. I have almost no rules-related complaints. Almost as thematic as Battlestar Galactica, and almost as fun as Cosmic Encounter.

[b]2 player:[/b] Not enough conflict. Plays relatively quickly though and is a pretty fun race, and if committed combat does occur... well, it will probably decide the game!
[b]3 player:[/b] Awesome. Faster than 4 player, but not as good

THE pirate game, in my opinion, and I find it shocking that it took this long to come up with it.  Totally has a great thematic feel with sweet bits and really love the gameplay.  Combat is appropriately streamlined, but there is occasion for a full on battle.  It does provide opportunities to be a savvy merchant or an evil pirate.  We missed a key rule about the event cards in the first game; I'm not sure if I think that it would have shortened the game such that it would lose some of its richness or would end up dragging on too long.  Looking forward to my next play, for sure.

UPDATE: Played with the correct rules, and while it is a bit long, I think that it is an enjoyable time and still a really fun pirate game.

I want to love this. Pirates! Sea battles! There's so much theme and such great production, yet it's not much fun. Part of the problem, I think, is that you can end up doing nothing on your turn, a cardinal sin for a game with long turns. I'm disappointed.

One of my favorites, it has all aspects I like and want in one game. I hooked many of my friends into boardgaming with this one. 
With the expansion I gave it 10, even without it, it's a pretty good game. But now, it's somewhat "whole".

This is a deep but extremely enjoyable pick up and deliver game.  I think what I love most about it is your ability to adjust how you play it each time depending on circumstances.

At the start of the game you are dealt a captain card.  Much like the name of the game suggests your two main courses of action are to either play the game as a pirate, marauding merchants and naval ships with a bounty on your head.  Or as a law-abiding merchant carrying goods from port to port and battling pirates for the bounty they offer.

The choice you make is very dependent on the captain you are dealt.  They each have a set of stats and a special ability.  This should tell you how to play the game to best effect.  It's not even usually about just pirate or merchant either.  In fact, most of the time the choices are a lot more granular.  For example, in my first game of this my captain had great stats for finding and marauding merchant ships but not so great in outright battle with naval ships.  Another player had a special ability that let him choose from more cargo cards at specific ports but wasn't so great at discovering rumors to acquire.

The amount of decisions to be made as well as the open-world nature of game play and variety of cards and outcomes make this an amazing game.  I was very, very pleased with it.  If it were only a little bit shorter it would be one I'd want to play all the time.  But at 3+ hours it simply isn't one you can bring out too terribly often and is complicated enough that it's certainly not for everybody.

The definitive pirate game, any fears I had from rules read through were blown out of the water within 5 minutes of play. There are so many different ways to approach the game it can satisfy pick up n deliver merchants and rip roaring violent types as well. I suspect there is a big dose of luck involved in the outcome but when its this much fun who cares?

The only downside is down time which in 4 player can be considerable - however this is a game that encourages players to interact , game wise and socially so the time waiting for your turn is not a drag.

This game is a very double-edged sword. One on hand there are the aesthetics and the theme. Apart from the cards (they are too small, especially the captain cards, and are underwhelming as a result), this game looks and feels amazing, especially the ship miniatures, and really makes you feel as if you are roaming the seas as a pirate or a merchant, which is very impressive. On the other hand, there is the aggravatingly slow and luck-based gameplay. You don't get to do a whole lot in one turn, which is especially annoying because it can take a while before your next turn arrives. For the few choices you can make, dice rolls determine the outcome of these choices way too much. All in all, because I buy a game not just to look at but to actually play, I was very disappointed with Merchants & Marauders.

This is the best pirate game I've played. Each player takes the role of one of 16 captains, each of whom has strengths and weaknesses which should be taken into account when deciding whether the best course is to lead the life of an honest merchant, or raise the jolly roger and go pirating.

The theme is extremely well realized. There are five different ship types, and various modifications and special weapons which can be added to enhance them (at a price). Or you may even take one as a prize. Combat resolution is fairly complex and involved, so when two ships battle it will require some time to resolve, even for experienced players. The rest of the game moves quickly, though. There is a much abbreviated resolution for pirates attacking non-player merchant ships. Merchant players will spend more time buying and selling trade goods, and tend to avoid combat more often than not.

There are non-player naval ships, pirates and merchants which must be taken into account, as well as missions, rumours and events, so those who yearn to immerse themselves in the world of Hollywood pirates are in for a treat. (If your tastes run to clean, luck free eurogames, you should run away screaming.)

It's a rich brew when taken all together, filled with interesting tactical choices. My only criticism is that the rules are a bit scattered, but the designer does a fine job of providing answers and support to ease the learning curve. If your tastes are like mine, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.

Great game. The only trouble I have with the game is that it takes awhile to play. Around 3 hours,  or more if you are trying to teach someone to play. Wished the ships had been made a little heavier than they were. Been looking for something to replace them. 
Edit: Need to remove a card from the deck to make it more playable. Remove the card that allows a player that is being attack to switch with navel ship.

Ameritrasher's dream. Open-ended play. Plenty of paths to victory. Variable with a new game every session. Can customize your ship/crew. Can really weave a narrative together and get into the theme. Tons of randomness, unpredictability, and swings of events. Can take half a day, but well worth it.

Hooray!!!  I FINALLY have the pirate game I've been waiting for all these years - an open-ended, swashbuckling adventure with different routes to victory!  And interestingly enough, you don't even need to ever become a pirate, remaining a wealthy merchant who is braving the dangerous seas (but what fun would that be?).  The game design is excellent and players get into the flow of the game quite quickly.  It can feel like there are a lot of fiddly rules, but that's the trade-off for having a lot of options in the game.  In fact, the openness of the design lends itself wonderfully to house rules, and I've even added a couple of new elements in the form of [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/608859/initial-ideas-for-squashs-ports-and-forts-variant]forts to attack[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/608896/initial-ideas-for-squashs-quotmobile-merchantsquot]mobile merchants[/url].  Thankfully, the game is also as visually stunning as it is fun to play.  All the components are top-notch, with the highlight definitely being the gorgeous ship sculpts (although those stinkin' sloops keep capsizing).  Out of frustration with the lack of good pirate games I had begun to design my own, but with the release of this masterpiece, I thankfully do not have to put in all the effort of completing my own design!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

RATING: 5
Too many rules to keep track of, especially if played infrequently. I can deal with rules heavy games like Agricola or Pret a Porter where they are mostly intuitive, but M&M rules are more like 'when this happens, do this' but with no strong mechanical connection that makes it easy to recall without always referring to the long text heavy rule book. Plus not good with 2P and takes much too long to finish for our liking. SOLD!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Takes quite a bit of time to go over the rules, but all the rules seem to be logical with the theme and that makes them far easier to pick up.  After about two turns it doesn't seem too difficult.

There can be quite a bit of AP/downtime between turns and a bunch of dice rolling, but the theme is so engrossing that those are less annoying than they would be in another game.  The beautiful components also add to the effect.

Would like to play again.  It seems like a full game could easily go 4 hours with 4 people unless everyone is blazing through their turns.  But the theme, oh the theme!

I played only once (yet), but I think this game is very well done, and mixes ameritrash with a few euro-ish elements very well. Due to the euro spice you are never eliminated from the game, bounty is elegantly sorted out, and there are equal opportunities to trade or loot. Almost perfect!

I don’t like one thing only – mixing rules with flavor. I prefer flavor separated from game text and either set using different typeface.

And one more fancy thing – I spotted old gameboard in the BGG repository:

Older versions of the game were for sure less balanced and relied heavily on dice, now I see that during long development it had been removed, what improved this game a lot.

Good theme play.  Game easy to learn and play, some fiddly rules.  Game plays OK.  Would like to see the NPCs move much more.  Game seems too focused on buying and selling of goods whether playing a pirate or a merchant.  Excellent combat system but I don't care for the PvP aspect.  Playing a Merchant is dull.    The game components are excellent - mounted board (although a dull color scheme), plastic playing pieces, fairly durable cards.  Game length is about 2 hours but feels alright.

24 MAY 11:  Finally got another game in and it went much smoother as would be expected.  It was an even better experience.  The theme is just hard to beat.  None of my other games have this much story depth.  Hope to play again soon.

2 APR 11:  Got my first game in last night with 2 of my gaming buddies.  We had a good time with this one.  After going over the rules and setting up to the end of gameplay we logged in over 8 hours.  Such a long session was purely our fault (just the composition of our group).  But if you are into lots of action and love the theme then this is an awesome game.  Give it a shot!  I painted the ships and got so mad after getting defeated by a pirate that I through it up against a wall (aaarg!!).

Looking forward to more plays to see if this rating goes up or down.

I'd like to rate it higher, but there's too much randomness for such a long game.  Pirate players need to be aware that they have to stalk merchant players to force them to either slow down or be attacked outright.  Remember that the three types of special weapons are available in every port, and are useful for rerolling.

First game (3-player) blighted by rules error (not replacing demand tiles after sale). Moving from trading to other actions caught us largely unawares. Game basically went to the luckiest player.

Second play (4-player). Three of us had played before, rules explanation benefited from actual play experience. Much, much tighter: 3 way tie (broken by saved cash) between an out & out pirate, a merchant, and a merchant who marauded late.

RATING: 10
Outstanding muti-layered pirate-themed action game. Players assume the roles of ship captains in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Firstly, you have to make a decision whether to opt for a career based around the transportation and trading of goods, or whether to search for ships to attack and steal from. From then on you are committed to finding the best way to profit from your chosen path and by doing this you accumulate money (which can be used in many different ways such as upgrading your ship, repairing it, acquiring rumours etc) and glory points, which are used to determine a victor. Everything in the game works so smoothly from the random availability of goods in each port to the simple and effective means of combat where a certain number of dice are rolled based on your attack strength and the results determine where on your opponents ship receives damage. There is so much going on in this game and there are so many routes to victory (this isn't purely a game where you decide whether to be a pirate or a law abiding merchant and that's it), and you are continually having to adapt to factors affecting your strategy. In short, this is the best game of its kind I've played, a theme-rich action game with a balanced amount of randomness which also rewards strong strategic play.

I'll play this again, but not for a while.

I thought that the production quality of this one was great, but in the end, the game was rather Meh.  

It did have the Sid Meier's pirates thing going for it, which I love, but it was much better when the computer was doing all of the stuff for you.  I don't like the 'Merchants' part of it, and the fact that 'Merchants' was such a big part of the game and so powerful.  It's more fun to be a pirate, but you're at a disadvantage.

I think Sea Rovers did what I wanted to much more, but that game is generally unavailable.

Probably the best all round game that can unite eurogamers ande war games. Play nicely as a merchant or play for blood as a pirate. Or switch mid game! It's so flexibile and so much fun along with amazing artwork and theme. 

Seems a tad rules heavy but little is complicated in reality so it's more a matter of remembering than being complex. Player vs. Player battle is the only thing where you need to follow the references sheet.

M&M has a good feel to it, but it's a very long-playing game. To be sure, three of us were beginners, but five hours? The number of parameters in the game are many and somewhat confusing; and, I think, unnecessarily numerous.

While the manual is clear if you internalize the somewhat odd terms, it might have been clearer not to include "Enter port" and "Exit port" under the "Move" action. Taking the turn, exit port, move, enter port has a very incomplete feel to it, as if one lost a turn. The end of the game rather sneaks up on one; it's rather odd that unstashed gold has zero value--after all, this is the gold you're taking out to risk in the world.

The game is a little too driven by the captain one draws. If you don't have a scout of 3, you shouldn't be a pirate however much you want to. I tend to agree that frigate and galleon are unbalanced; my solution would be to drop galleon maneuver to 1 or to give +1 scouting if you have a frigate (you can see farther from the tall masts).

While the game tries to have a realistic feel, it misses that crew displaces cargo. Incorporating this trade-off might force a more definite choice between merchant and marauder. Also, ships were captured (wooden ships were very difficult to sink in combat, barring a magazine explosion).

This is the ultimate pirate game.  It's steeped in theme, and carries it's systems well.  Great quality bits, awesome little ships and even pirate chests.  I like that play time can be tailored to suit your groups desires, even so the play is engaging enough that longer play times are not an issue.  It's well balanced and very intuitive, rules are clear if a little clunky at times.  Best part is not only does the theme suit, but it's immersive and more realistic than most pirate games.  Goes great with rum!

RATING: 8.3
For now this is *the* pirate game.  Features tight mechanisms integrated with loads of thematic hook.  Nothing feels bolted-on or gamey.  Not to mention, M&M is handsomely produced with respect to all aspects of its components.  Big coin boxes are a little hoakey.  Not sure where this will end up (+1/-1) in a year or so, but for now, M&M is a blast.  Remarkably well-balanced for the diverse play styles that the game supports. 

Still a superb game.  Still love it.  No longer a '10' in my book.  A little too much down-time between turns and the combat system for my tastes is perhaps overly-prolonged if not overly-complicated.  Avast and beware ye who play with more than three!

Too long for four players. Interminably boring yet game-winningly effective to be a merchant. Loads of downtime. Random dice rolls used to determine if you can even perform certain actions on your turn. If you fail, it's likely you've wasted your entire turn -- which then leads to more downtime.

Some othe user posted that as rating comment, while our conclusion is vastly different (he rated it a 5  while I rated it a 9). I think his description is really useful.

Ok pirate game, but nothing special. Mix of familiar mechanisms like pick-up-and-deliver with random luck from dice rolls and different types of cards. Limited number of important decisions (e.g. going merchant or marauder). The pirate theme is nicely integrated in the game play, but leaves me lukewarm.
//

Don't buy this game for the mechanics. The appeal of this game is the integrated  theme (with solid mechanics) and the experience. I know no other pirate game that allows all that possibilities and still works.  It is (rather) long, it has a high luck factor and the number of decisions is limited (but there are crucial decisions). However the complete package just feels great.

The game is quite entertaining and deserves acclaim as the best pirate-themed AT game out there. I wonder if being a Merchant isn't straight up easier than being a Pirate, though.

Beautiful components and amazing game design. You can tell they worked a long time on this one. The rules are pretty simple. The only complicated bit is NPC/player combat, and even then it really takes only one fight to "get it".

A sweeping epic of a game that plays very similarly to Sid Meier's Pirates computer gaem. This one is interesting in that, within a loose framework, players have a very open-ended path to follow. They can focus on trading, become pirates, pursue rumors, undertake missions and visit 16 different ports, each with its own special function. And all these things seem to be viable ways to pursue glory points. Starting my rating off at a 7, as I have played this only as a two-player affair, and player interaction is almost non-existent since the map is so large. I suspect this game shines with a busier board and four players - looking forward to finding out. Update: Game rating bumped up a notch after confirming what I suspected ... this game works with two players but shines with four.

The game I love but have yet to finish a game. 

When we played this last we sped it up quite a bit since we were familiar with the rules but still took 2+ hours and we ended up just stopping since all three of us had recently died, two of us to each other and the other to an NPC.

Love the theme, a seafaring Piratical Adventure is something I will always suggest on game nights!

RATING: 7
Great game.  For one, the board and bits are gorgeous - one of my best looking games.  For another, it's much easier to learn and teach than it has any right to be due to stellar rules writing and player aides. And it really is a lot of fun, at least on your own turn.  But it leans a bit too much towards multi-player solitaire.  Too often there's little reason for me to pay attention to the actions taken by other players, and turns can be quite lengthy.  That makes the game feel longer than it actually takes (and it's certainly not a short game to begin with).

UPDATE: I've taught the game a few more times and I think I gave it too much credit for being easy to teach.  There is a LOT for new players to absorb, though you can hold off teaching some of it, like combat, until it comes up.

After one play I don't think I will be playing this one again. Suffers from the multi-player/solitaire syndrome. Most are looking to avoid direct conflict and port actions cause some serious downtime between turns. I'll stick with Blackbeard.

Perhaps a touch long but otherwise just about everything I could have hoped for in a pirate-themed game.  Generates a terrific sense of narrative, which for me is key.

Though it's a long game (2.5+ hours) it's super fun and the theme just soaks through the mechanics and you REALLY feel like you're sailing the Caribbean and trying to make it as either a merchant or a marauder.

This is easily the best pirate game I have ever played. It can take quite a while to play, so it's not for the faint of heart, and it really relies heavily on theme.

I've played this game a few times now with friends, and I haven't had a poor experience with it. I just don't love it as a pirate game. I feel like the game play is a bit long, and that your choice of captain at the beginning of the game can be very limiting and stick you with being either a merchant or a marauder. I want the ability to choose and play it any which way no matter which captain I get, so I feel like their powers are a bit limiting.

It's good! Mostly I'm a sucker for the theme but it helps it's a solid game. Combat is a little wonky, but it works well and captures the 'ships meet, ships shoot, someone runs or gets boarded' flow extremely well.

AND

I was working a pirate game that sounded DAMN close to this when it came out. Mine was hex based and each player controlled a fleet instead of a single ship, and there was nothing like captain cards.

I like to think of this as the 'lite' version of what I was designing :D

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
First Impression:
A highly thematic game, that creates an unbelievable narrative after play. However it doesn't flow well, and there are balance issues. 

For starters, the map is too huge even for 4 players, as in a vanilla 10 glory point game, each player will hardly pass through half the map. So player interaction is so poor it almost feels like a solo multiplayer. Even with 4 players I'd be surprised if ship vs ship combat happens more than 1-2 (3max) times during the game. (and that includes player vs npc battles)

Then there are the balance issues.. The game offers two distinct gameplay approaches, a safe one (merchant) and a risky one (pirate). But, for some funny unknown reason the safe one, is also the most rewarding! Add to that the fact that the merchant is both less fun and more time consuming and you get a game of great, yet unfulfilled potential.

OK, so what do the players do with their time>? Buy/Sell goods? Not even that, and that's the biggest game problem. Players WAIT most of their time. It takes about 10 seconds to figure out your next move (strategy starts and ends at set-up, and any tactics elements occur DURING YOUR turn), so you'll have absolutely nothing to do (but watch), while your mates play their turns.

To sum it up, this game suffers from overambitious design, poor balance and boring downtime.
Fortunatelly, not all is lost. Home rules can correct the balance/design issues, but the downtime is trickier. I believe that keeping a captain's log (as in writing what happened during your turn after you end it) is the best all around solution. More plays needed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Outstanding pirate game. Plays best with three in my experience due to significant downtime with four. I find that lowering the glory points needed to win down to about 6 makes for a nice length game with 4 players. Playing to ten glory points is epic, but quite long. It would seem that playing as a merchant is the easiest way to win, but I need to play a few more times and test a few strategies to know for sure. 

UPDATE- LOOOONG downtime brings this down from a 9 to an 8.5. Great fun- but so much time spent waiting around with 4 players.

RATING: 7.5
If you like pirate themes and don't mind a LONG game, this would be good for you.  If you are unsure about this game before trying it, and you know already you don't like long games, I'd recommend playing it once before buying it.  The components, feel, and theme of the game are very nice.  It is solid in many ways, but just very LLLOOONNNGGG.  We tried taking out the Mission, Rumor, and Glory cards, and it was still on the long side for our normal play.  Hard-core gamers probably won't mind the length too much, but most people who would come over to play aren't likely up for this epic.

Amazing thematic game that tells a grand story. One of my absolute favorites. I like that the game allows you to choose your path, and decide to be a law abiding merchant, or a deadly pirate. The theme is already strong with the mechanics, but all of the mission cards and rumors, and events with flavor text really add to the story that is being weaved. The fighting is great fun, and upgrading the ships to suit your needs. It really is just excellent.

There are many ways to play the game. One may even change their initial plan as the game progresses. The amount of interaction depends on how aggressive players are. The introduction of NPC is interesting and hence make this game tighter even in a 2-player game. 

However, I must admit I am not a fan of dice throwing especially when it is something which I can't control. For example, acquiring a rumour where one has to spend 2 gold and get a successful dice throw. It all comes down to luck. In addition, the choice for mission seemed a bit limited.

Merchants & Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering. The game features a unique trade system and a thematic combat system, allowing for critical decisions and intense excitement. Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunitions and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?

After ~8 plays I give up: underdeveloped and overproduced game with too much downtime and random fortune-at-the-end. Critical reviews already express the other reasons to decline. Very fiddly if you actually want to observe all of the rules, and the UI scatters too much important information.

Still expecting a better game in future from these designers; there is thematic stuff to like and that's why it's obtained so many overlong plays, as well as two copies bought within my gaming groups.

The game has a tentative rating of 7. I have my doubts but thus far, with one play, the game shows promise. Just not sure how much higher the rating can go. On first brush, the game looks sandboxey, but I can also easily see how the game can feel repetitive after a while. There are certainly some routes that are more optimal than others and some sea zones are clearly superior (I am looking at you, Old Providence). In general, if you are a pirate, the extra weapons are a must. Being able to equip yourself to change the die face to a "win" is critical for getting glory points after the plunder. It is not tough, especially if you get 2-3 skulls to achieve the necessary cards. Old Providence is also very well equipped for piracy. That said, the NPC can provide some tension and also blocks the ability of ships to move back and forth.

Overall, the game is undoubtedly thematic and loads of cool stories courtesy of the rumor and mission cards. I love the simplicity of the design and movement, but not the die rolls so much. Combat is not tough to grasp, but there is a lot of die rolling around, even for me.

I certainly would love to play it again to see how the game flows with 2.

This game is definitely the essential pirate game if you're into that. You can stick to being a Merchant, trading goods to turn a profit and upgrading your ship to ward off enemy pirates, or you can decide that you'd like to give piracy a shot - raid merchants, capture enemy vessels, and rake in the loot. Whichever path you choose you'll also be looking into rumors, completing missions, and seeking out glory. 
My one major issue is the same for any dice combat game: sometimes you just get unlucky and when your ship goes down you essentially start from scratch next turn. I will defend it somewhat by saying it's is very thematic and interesting.

Quality production, great theme. Unfortunately, there is significant downtime (in the port action), and balance is skewed towards trading (not piracy). Missions/rumors ends up not being pursued, because there are easier ways to earn VP's.

Variants such as cutthroat promote more fights, but serve to close down the board, making it even less tempting to go after missions and rumors.

This game has me so torn.  It makes me grin like a kid playing it, really does a good job of emulating Sid Meier's Pirate video game that I loved growing up.  This is a game that tells a story, ports change allegiance, your career could change from lowly merchant to frightening pirate.  The battle system feels convoluted, and I have to relearn it every time I play, it's daunting for new players... but it does offer multiple paths to victory in a battle, and the ability to pull off surprise wins.  

The downsides for me are primarily the downtime.  It can be really dull just watching someone go to a market and choose cards in secret.  It's a long wait if someone is getting into combat.  My other complaints are tied to what make the game great, lots of fiddly things to manage on the board, and rules complexities to relearn each time you play.  People can get lucky and run away with the game and be very hard to prevent... but damn it all if this game isn't fun to play.

RATING: 3
I only played once, but that was enough. The rules are simultaneously convoluted, and fail to explain many of the numerous subsystems adequately.

The game is unapologetically random, with success or failure relying on barely mitigated luck. While this is common in ameritrash games in this game the luck based elements feel arbitrary and extremely decisive. 

Overall the game design feels convoluted and unintuitive. It's like the designer was very excited about the game and kept adding rules whenever they thought of something cool they wanted players to be able to do.

The art, miniatures and components are fantastic though.

RATING: 3
I bought the game because I wanted a pirate/merchant theme game. But it's too random for my blood. The randoms comes from anywhere (dice for battles, cards (missions), NPC movement) too many luck elements while you have to remember a lot of game rules. I have no problem with light random games, but here you have to remember a lot of details, rules and parameters to have dice decide most of the outcomes. Oh and also there is no benefits in being a Pirate in this game. I didn't like it.

Strong theme, some cool mechanics, some balance issues to make it a 7...

[+] Artwork, components, mechanics are great; theme is awsome
[-] ship-to-ship combat is so random and unforgiving, the way the NPC ship move doesn't work well, snowball effect where rich gets richer, ships feel unbalanced (galleon/frigate >>> slope/...); very abrupt and anti-climatic endgame due to staching gold. I've seen a variant here on BGG playing with a scoring cards where you can only get so many points from the same action (ex: only 3pt staching gold/ 3 p from raids / ...) to balance the game...

It was looking for a publisher, then it found one, then it didn't, then it did again, and finally it has come out.  Slow burn, much?  I've been following this game for a while, which meant I had very high hopes.  I'm not ecstatic about it now that I've gotten the chance to play it, but I'm not disappointed, either.  It is the first pirate game to not be a complete pile of poop deck.  It's such a rich theme, I'm amazed it took this long, but I'm happy it finally did.  The decisions of the captains about when and if to turn rogue are well-modeled, particularly with the increasing difficulty of doing so as more navies get involved.  I sense that there's a lot of historical backing here, hidden by a heavy layer of pretty bits and neat chrome, which is exactly the type of game I like.  Obviously owes a lot to [gameid=25685], but is much better.  Very solid.

I had some initial apprehension when author Christian really emphasized that this was not a eurogame, but I went ahead and purchased anyway, because I really wanted to support him after all the crap he went through to get this published. He deserves a hit.

And I think it delivers. It's just plain fun to sail around, pick up rumours, events, trade goods, or go plain ol' buccaneering on someone's %^&. :D We mostly just attack the NPC's rather than each other, but it still works that way.

It's a testament to the great design that this is already one of the most houseruled games on BGG. This isn't a fault, it's a strength. You can lengthen the game, shorten it, add players, make combat easier, harder, more or less frequent, tweak the balance between playing as a merchant vs a pirate based on how you or your group plays. Just amazing.

I want to love this game but I cannot give it a better score than a 6.  The theme is great, the naval combat mechanics are amazingly fun, and the game has great production value.  Unfortunately, there is something fundamentally wrong with the game balance between merchants and pirates (the base game rules favors merchants heavily and makes it near impossible for pirates to come close).  With that said, the game is still worth looking into if you are a fan of pirate themed games.  As I have said before, the naval combat aspect of the game is amazingly fun, which makes playing the role of a pirate well worth the effort ... as long as you are willing to suffer defeat in what seems to be 9 out of 10 times.

I have waited a long time for the perfect Pirate game to come along and Merchants & Marauders does not disappoint.  On the surface it seems pretty light - move your ships, buy and sell goods and try to stay out of trouble.  It is certainly possible (and maybe a little bit easier) to eke out a win this way.  But it is so much fun taking the pirate route.  You get to chase your foes around the Caribbean blasting them with grape shot and plundering their vessels.  You still need to be careful though - the NPC naval ships are not to be taken lightly, and with bounties on your head you just never know when one of your opponents might try to take you on for the reward.  What can I say?  Fun, fun, fun!!!

I have owned this game for a few years now and it has become my favorite board game of all time. I have played several times with different groups of people and look forward to playing this as much as possible for years and years. The solo variant rules created by Woelf (which are posted in the Merchants and Marauders forum) are fantastic. I enjoy playing this game solo more than I enjoy playing other games that were designed as solitaire games. This is more of a thematic adventure game than a strategy game, but using good strategy is certainly key to winning the game.

I feel compelled to address a couple of the issues people have brought up in negative reviews. First, I have read multiple times that people feel there are no meaningful decisions.  One reviewer even went so far as to say that all you do is buy cargo, move, then sell. I have to ask myself "What game are these people playing?!" Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the variety of choices laid out before a player on any given turn is, in my opinion, one of the things that makes this game really special.  

If I had just bought two cargo of, say, spices on my previous turn, I would have a slew of choices before me on my current turn: should I immediately try to unload these in a port where spices are not in demand (for a small profit) in order to get a different kind of cargo? should I go to another port and try to get more spices and then continue on to sell them later? should I take what I have to a port where spices are in demand and sell there even though I only have 2 spices? since there is a pirate sailing around near that sea zone I want to get to, should I turtle up and cower here waiting for it to move, or should I take the risk and hope he won't find me or that I'll be able to escape if he does find me...or should I change plans altogether so I don't have to deal with that pirate? should I forget about these spices and try to take advantage of that vulnerable merchant ship over there? should I attack my buddy's ship that just got a little too close to me? should I try to find a nice juicy rumor that could net me a nice earning of gold, an abandoned ship, or cool abilities that will help me throughout the game? should I go claim that mission that the governor of San Juan is sponsoring wherein I scout out my pirate buddy and lead the Spanish navy to him? should I focus on upgrading my ship so that it can become the strongest ship sailing the seas and I can go hunting? should I sail to Port Royal to attempt to recruit that Master Carpenter to join my crew? should I try to hunt down that pirate over there to earn a nice gold reward?

To me the possibilities are HUGE and if people are somehow missing all of that, I can only conclude that they either don't understand this game or they are pre-disposed not to like games that are different from what they are familiar with.  

The other thing I have read quite a few times is that being a merchant (rather than a pirate) is an auto win.  First of all, there is nothing that says a player must be either a merchant OR a pirate, i.e. you don't have to just be one or the other. There are numerous ways for players to engage in piracy and also to have their criminal deeds forgiven. When I last played with serious gamer friends, the guy who won did an awesome job of balancing trading/merchanting with preying on the weak when the right opportunities came along. Pirates have the ability to raid merchants which are plentiful when the game begins and, in my opinion, allows the players who choose piracy right off the bat to get a nice head start (sometimes merchants will have to traverse the entire Caribbean to get to a port where there cargo of sugar is in demand). Some missions, like acquiring a Letter of Marque, are only available to players that have engaged in piracy so players that choose to be strictly merchants will miss those opportunities. The max number of game-controlled pirates is 2, while the max number of game-controlled naval ships is 4, meaning that while there are always more ships trying to hunt down pirates than there are pirates hunting down merchants, there is also more opportunity for pirate players to attack and plunder ships. In my opinion, the balance between all of possible choices and paths that players can take to victory is shockingly balanced. It is not perfect, but a player can certainly win any way he or she wants to if they plan well, take the right risks, and get lucky to have some things go their way.  Being a merchant is in no way an auto win.  

Feel free to PM me if you have questions and are on the fence about buying this game.  I'll try to provide an honest assessment of if you'd enjoy it or not. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the right crowd this game is simply phenomenal.

The amount of play when a player sets in to port or goes into a battle means that there can be a significant amount of "down time" between turns. With two players this is completely reasonable, but it gets pretty unwieldy in 3 and 4 player games. I've experimented with house rules for speeding up play, but I don't think it will be possible to change this without a severe negative impact on the game.

Very thematic.  Perhaps more of an adventure experience then a game and am not sure yet how it sits with me.

Merchants & Marauders recreates almost every single aspect of the PC classic "Sid Meier's Pirates!", but in boardgame form. The only things missing are the town raids, yet I have a feeling even those will be coming down the line at some point, in an expansion box. The game can be a little challenging to teach, mostly due to all of the different ship upgrades and a somewhat unintuitive combat system. Once you get the hang of it however, it plays quite smoothly. 

As with most games that feature player vs. player combat, there can be some downtime issues. Generally speaking though, there is usually plenty of planning to fill the time. The game offers an incredible amount of freedom, allowing you to chase after Glory points however you choose. The rules also never lock you into a strategy. You can play the whole game as a crafty merchant and then jump into piracy at the drop of a hat to take advantage of an easy target. This flexibility gives the game its incredible flavor and ultimately will make it an Ameritrash classic.

After one play it is my preferred pirate game. M&M is an excellent age of sail game where players can choose a non-confrontational or aggressive styles of play. There is a wide variety of activities, and it really embodies the feeling of the age of piracy. 

Turns are rich, with lots of actions, so there is quite a bit of down time. Once players are familiar with the game it will take about 30 minutes per player.

If you were looking for Sid Meier's "Pirates" in a board game, this isn't it.  Some of the elements are there and it's a worthy attempt but there's room for improvement.  Still, that's not saying it isn't good.  It plays more friendly than Blackbeard and still has a good swashbuckler flavor to it.  There's plenty to do and really the choice is yours to risk more to gain more as a pirate or follow the life of a merchant (or a little of both).  Not really a Euro, but not quite pure Ameritrash either.  More of an adventure genre.

I highly recommend the game, and say you should read my review below or watch my video review on the M&M Page. But I find a lot of the same complaint from people, that being a Pirate is too tough. 

I think the problem is that people are concentrating on going after the NPC merchants, instead of trying to chase down the other players who aren't pirating. I have twice lost games as a merchant because a pirate chased me down before I could stash a large amount of gold. 

Early game, trade for money, upgrade your ship, then start going after the other players and upgrading your specials.

american style game with wonderful components, beautiful art and deeply immersive theme. that said, i don't like games where a single card or dice throw can ruin an entire strategy and unfortunately M&M seems the case. Everything is in need of luck here and a single card in an equilibrated game can decide a honorless winner.
there's the suspect that a merchant can simply go from port to port accumulating money without risking to meet pirates.
there are too many little rules, the system combat is waaay to cumbersome to be exciting, there is too much to read when you are about to take a decision: map zones, cards, others' cards in play, others' capabilities, automatic ships capabilities, events, missions... all this makes the game very rich but also analysis paralysis prone.

My opinion isn't favorable.  The merchant strategy, in particular, is mindless and repetitive: sell in-demand goods three at a time for glory points, buy goods cheaply (if possible) that are in demand in nearby ports, and stay out of attacking range of marauding pirates.

There was a lot of downtime in our first session (4 players, 4+ hours), which certainly didn't do much to improve my impression of the game.  Once players were comfortable with the way that ports worked, we finally sped things along by having players take their turns while other players were busy with their port actions. Having too many players take their turns simultaneously can get confusing, though - which happened a number of times.

In terms of mechanics, I was surprised to find a number of similarities (e.g., port usage, the earning of enemy status with different countries, country warfare) between Merchants & Marauders and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13347/plunder]Plunder[/url], the small-box pirate game released in 2004. But by no means are the games identical.  The board in Plunder is "built" during the game (with cards) using an exploring mechanic, whereas in M&M the board is fixed.  And at its core, Plunder is about card management; M&M, in contrast, is a dice game.  Finally, combat in Plunder is much more lethal: If neither player escapes, one of the captains is definitely taking a coral nap in the deep blue.  In M&M, the losing player has a good chance of limping away so that s/he can put into port for repairs and live to loot another day.

As far as the evolution of all-things-pirate, M&M definitely improves upon some of Plunder's shortcomings (e.g., the in-demand good at a specific port changes after each sale at that port), but the overall level of fun is approximately the same.  Consequently, given the tremendous difference in playtime between the two games (4 hours vs. 90 minutes), I have to say that I prefer Plunder.  Truthfully, though, neither game is particularly engrossing.

This game is all-around just plain awesome, and it sits comfortably at the top of my list of favorite games.


There are a lot of rules to keep track of and the sheer number of options can seem overwhelming at first, but it's all intertwined so perfectly with the theme that everything flows very smoothly once you get into it.  Plus the included reference sheet covers everything you could possibly need, so you really don't need to memorize much at all.

Visually, this is a beautifully produced game.   The artwork is fantastic, and the miniatures are superb whether you decide to paint them or not.  The tokens are all nice thick cardboard, and the cards, while small, have the nice linen finish so they should last a long time.   If you feel the desperate need to sleeve something the cargo cards could benefit, but most of the others barely ever get shuffled or passed around so sleeves are unnecessary for them.


The negatives are few and are fairly minor, but to some people they can be deal-breakers:
--Downtime between turns can sometimes be a factor, but it's usually a symptom of slow decision making.   If you pay attention during other players' turns and plan ahead a bit, most of that issue goes away.   And for everyone's sake, turn off your damn phone/iPad/etc. and put it away.
--Luck can be a factor in the game, with plenty of dice rolls and card draws, but there are countless ways to mitigate or at least minimize that luck so it's not going to get in your way unless you're one of those players that absolutely despise all randomness/luck in any form.
--Game time is approximately 45 minutes per player, although with experienced players that time will drop significantly.    I've completed entire 2-player games in about an hour more than once [i](not counting setup or takedown, which adds maybe 5-10 minutes on each end)[/i].



I highly recommend this game for anyone, not just fans of Pirate games.  

If you already like Pirate games, you will not find a better one than this.

  I love this game and the immersive pirate theme it brings.  Battles are a bit fiddly and unfortunately it's a bit too heavy for my wife who is my main gaming partner so I don't get it to the table too often.  Nonetheless, every time I get to play it, I really enjoy the experience it provides.

I love pirates.. and I love this theme. The game plays really well, it feels a bit heavy in the beginning, but once you're used to it - you'll be sinking your friends' ships in no time. This is some ideal Ameritrash gaming.

A really fun family game with integral theme. Game play is a bit of a journey as players progress. Downtime while other players take their turn is a bit if an issue, as is remembering some of the specifics of the combat rules.

RATING: 9
THE pirate game I have always wanted.  Yes, its a bit long.  Yes, being a pirate can be tough.  But that's the life of a pirate.  I love everything about this game except for the long downtime during port actions.  But its so worth it.  The battle system is elegant and thematic at the same time.  The NPC movement can at times feel eerily personal.  Every game plays out like a story, filled with ups and downs, sea battles (mast destroyed, guns out of commission, a last desperate attempt to board the ship... and the ensuing melee going down to the last man) and island adventures (I once was killed by natives while trying to rescue some noble's wife I think it was).  My only complaint would be that I don't play it more often.

Game is a little too random.
The designers should have made the choice of ship captain a non-optional rule. And then gone on to add a few more rules to reduce randomness.

RATING: 4
Beautiful and visually appealing, but too much downtime. The balance trade vs being a pirate is off (favors traders, in a pirate game). Ship power balance is off too. Lacks good flowing mechanics (too many actions allowed / possible in 1 turn gives huge downtime, i've never seen it this worse in any other game). Even battling is tiresome and takes too long. Feels like they haven't properly tested this game before releasing it.
 
I really want to love this game, the concept is great and the visuals stunning, but it just doesn't work and none of my friends like it much too. Played it with 3 groups, quite a few times, but it just doesn't click. It's too fiddly, there's no flow. So much potential ... Lets hope there'll be a more streamlined and balanced edition in the near future. It ticks a lot of boxes, but is let down by the gameplay.

Length of game variable but often very long.  Often possible to be in a position where you have no chance to win right from the start of the game.  Nice theme, nice components, horrible horrible game.

RATING: 8.75
Whilst I am not a fan of the dice rolling mechanic, Merchants & Merauders have utilised this mechanic rather well. It is certainly suited to the uncertain career of a pirate. Various risk mitigating mechanics have also been built into the game for those who dislike pure dice rolling.

The rules are on the fiddly side, but once players know them well, the game should flow smoothly and game time kept low. There are numerous ways to earn the required 10 glory points for victory, and that provides some variety in the game.

Interaction may be lower for 2 player games, but the presence of non-player captains maintain the tension to a large extent.

Last but not least, the artwork and quality of game components are excellent.

RATING: 9
I've read quite a bit about the history and myths surrounding piracy in the Caribbean, and this game captures that feel better than any other pirate themed board game. It looks fantastic, and feature very well written rules. This is ameritrash at its finest, pure and simple thematic fun; get into the theme and enjoy the game, don't and you might be bored.

This game by itself is great, it really is, but with the Seas of Glory expansion, it's damn near perfect!

Bumped this from a 9 to a 10 due to how much my wife enjoys this game meaning I get it to the table far more often than I expected to.  Really and fun thematic game that feels like the telling of a story at times.

9 months later I still consider this one of my wife and I's favorite games.  Really tells a story.

Thumbs up for components, theme and board. Thumbs down for the pure fact that everything depends on your randomly drawn captain and the fact that it's just so much easier to win as a trader (even with the auto-spot mod). Friggin boring merchants!

This game is a blast to play and the victory points can be either slow to get or explode all at once. This is great for the game since anyone has a chance to win even in the late game phase. I really like the different routes players can take to playing the game (Merchant or Pirate). It plays up to the players different play style while allowing players to switch mid game if they want. 

The components of the game are great and the play time is about perfect. Although the game could drag out if players are AP prone with their port actions or they don't plan out their moves before their turn begins.

The only complaint I have of the game is the fact that the Galleon is almost superior in all ways incomparision to the Frigate. The only advantage the Frigate has is against Merchant Raids. With the 1 more skill point in manuverability, its better against all the escape cards that merchant raiding will bring.

I like this game a lot! Many different options, custom ship upgrades and very nice components. It's best played with 4 players (I played with two, but you have to chase the other player ship in order to interact with him/her). The only negative thing is the extremely long time it take to take port or battle actions with respect to moving actions. Sometimes you have to downtime is really long.

It is a beautiful boardgame, full of stuff and really engaging. Role playing gamers would love this and the mechanics fit really well. It is an improved version of Pirates of Spanish Main. I love the cards and the combat system, I love in the sense they are multipurpose and gives a track of what you should do. I don't play it often because it is really long and doesn't come  in spanish. It is not a deep game so it feels repetitive some times, not really strategic. My friends and I had problems with the so many rules, easy forgetabble. In general a long game but fun.

The pirate game you've been waiting for, if you've been waiting for a game that makes you feel like a pirate... without also feeling like a bookkeeper.  Or when you simply want to outwit the enemy, and continue peacefully and prosperously on your merchant's way.

Fast-paced, and multi-pronged.  Each avenue to victory is viable, and every engagement has the potential to go horribly wrong or fantastically right!

Plus, while the basic rules are easy enough (with a little help from your forum friends) to grasp the game has an excellent amount of grit and complexity.  This makes the replay value much higher than it might be if the game were A) shorter, or B) less complex.

It's not all 'bang-bang, I win; bang-bang, you lose'.  Rather there are subtleties of strategy to be thought out and executed (or foiled), and even a major setback (you've lost your ship, your cargo and your captain...feel free to start again) doesn't always, or even usually, spell defeat.  The game system itself presents major obstacles for either side.  Let alone your fellow players...who invariably throw a wrench in your works.

Great game!  And beautifully presented.

It has pirates. 'Nuff said.  

Honestly though, a brilliant game through and through.  Entertaining and fun...completely immersive in terms of theme.  If there is a complaint it would be that it's a WEE bit fiddly in terms of rule complexity, but even that isn't a turn-off for me particularly when you consider that there isn't anything that needs to be done "better."  

There are a few variants (both officially approved) that are worth playing, but even if you ignore them the game is flat out wonderful.

Easily one of my favourite games. I wish it played 5 so we could bring it out with a larger group, but I'm always up for a game of M&M. I love the fact you can win either by playing nice or evil. 

I've discussed the notion of having a 5-player variant where the 5th player controls the various nation's navies, meaning they can move around more intelligently. It'd be interesting to try out and see how it works.

RATING: 6
This is a really fantastic pirating game. There are innumerable paths to victory, and they aren't even mutually exclusive. To compound the fun, there are so many different cards for each section of the game that the replayability looks to be very high.

My only gripe so far is that it feels like the game might end suddenly if a person plays their stash correctly. I had the opportunity to jump from 5 to 10 glory in a single turn in my first play (which ended due to time constraints). It seems that more experienced players could exploit this jump possibility to end the game in a way that is unsatisfying for all players.

RATING: 7
Great thematic game, captures the spirit of a good pirate game. Components are very beautiful. Playing a pirate is great fun and risky. Acquiring rumors, buying upgrades and doing missions add a story to the game. Good idea to include NPC pirates and naval warships/piratehunters. 

minors : There is dice rolling luck involved and action builds up slow yet is very active in the final rounds. 
Also it's hard to catch up to the first player who captures a ship.
Some annoying and frustrating 'take that cards' in the glory decks. 
The NPC ships should be moving a lot more. 
The VP winning condition needs a tweak : less vp from gold, more from missions and rumours.

The game is way to long, it seems like you are playing your own little game of solitaire, and then waiting for the 3 others playing. 

The game moves so slowly that when it is your turn, you cut down on the whole flavor of the rumors and missions, since you don't want to take away to much of the time that it already takes. 

I really wanted to like this game, as I loved the old Sid Meiers Pirates, and this was looking so much like it, but it failed to capture it, since the old Pirates you were alone against the computer that wouldn't so much time on each round.

RATING: 7
Great game that lives up to the idea of pirates and merchants in the Caribbean.  Plays well, but a warning, can be absolutely brutal if you have a string of bad rolls!  This would be my one complaint, there is too much decided by chance and Glory cards (which can help mitigate the chance side of the game) are extremely hard to come by.  Also because of this there is the chance of one player running away with the game as there isn't much in the way to balance the final score as in other games such as Pirates of Nassau.  Bit slow to start off, but once everyone knows the rules it flows really quickly.  It is very fun though, if you can get over the odd game where you are completely devastated through no fault of your own. Rage quitters need not apply!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great theme!

 But the gameplay seems a bit messy at times, and there are massive downtime for the players who are waiting for their turns. Although I find it rather interesting to follow other captains port actions, and as such, it is not a huge disadvantage. Combat seems a bit "overthought" and are heavy on the rules and actions, taking long time to determine and play extra weapons/glory cards/specialists etc. which makes the flow of combat rather painful. I think the combat part should have been streamlined and simplified a bit more. 

 This is after just one game - will re-review and add any notes and changes I find necessary :)

 Still, a great and fun game with good theme!

Only played once at this point, but I'm extremely impressed. The mechanics are crisp and intuitive, the ship battles are deceptively simple yet fair in their execution, and the game both punishes and rewards the player's career choices. It's essentially two amazingly crafted games in one box, and the fact that they rival each other in enjoyment and viability is brilliantly refreshing.

Edit: 1/5/13
Now that I've played it a few times, I'm lowering the rating by a half a point for general downtime. Other than that, this game really is extremely enjoyable.

Must be lowered yet again. It just doesn't hold my group over the duration. It's amazing that Arkham is twice as long yet everyone stays enraptured, but such is life.

RATING: 7.5
Can be a simple 'pick up and deliver' game, and it does that well enough - buy low, sell high, accrue lots of cash. But take the leap into piracy and the game really shines. Other players become fearful of ending their turn at sea in case you rob them blind, and it's WAY more satisfying.

Components are stunning too, and I challenge anyone to not want to upgrade to the galleon after they see the mini for it (especially when compared to their starting sloop).

Only slightly marred by what I believe is an imbalance in the captains. Some are obviously far better than others.

Good speed on this one.  Planning is a little tough with 4 players, but it provides some interesting choices.  It's not much shorter than the original.  The box is horrendously big...I'll be demolishing it soon.

When I read the rules, I thought, "Hey great, a streamlined version of Samurai! It sounds awesome." The reality though is that the village placement rule bugged me to no end (some convoluted rule about placing it when two different colored player cards are adjacent to each other, but not if there are two of the same color around...). I much prefer the fixed board of original Samurai where the cities/villages are preset locations. The black game pieces are fantastic, but the cards are very dull and boring in terms of artwork. The end game scoring is easier to understand, but still feels disjointed from the actual game play. The Card Game doesn't really capture the magic of the original - I'd rather place the original anytime.

RATING: 6
Takes up a lot of space for a card game. As a quick 2p, it's a light fun game with enough tactics to keep you engaged. Wonder if 3p has a little too much potential for unintentional king-making in the last few turns as the scoring is very tight. Still, quite happy to play as there's enough to keep you interested.

This is Knizia at his worst. Took a great game and tried to milk it for its namesake. The result is a bastardization.

Avoid at all costs. It's not shorter than classic Samurai, which is incomparable to this garbage. And don't even think about portability because this takes up 4 times the table top compared to Samurai.

I actually liked this a fair bit more than the board game.  It's much more streamlined and captures what Samurai tries to capture, but in a much tighter time frame that I enjoyed much more.  Still the very tense scoring and game play but requiring much less commitment in terms of both time and rules learning.

RATING: 6
Players are Japanese nobles, attempting to influence cities to reap rewards.  Players on their turn lay a card from their hand adjacent to a city card.  This rapidly grows a game board of cities and influence cards.  When a city's cardinal points are filled in, the reward go to the players who influenced it the most.  New cities will appear, nicely triggered by the card placement mechanic.  Game ends when rewards, cities, or a player's cards run out.  A nice implementation of the Samurai board game, much lighter in rules and easier to explain.  Let down by the graphics - some contrast between cities and player's cards would have been nice; also the play area will quickly engulf most tables; finally, it doesn't feel any shorter than the board game.  The board game version is much nicer on the eyes, and if you own that you probably don't need this.

Very simple gameplay in a very abstract game. Quick, easy, mainly optimising your moves and trying to place new villages to make opponents' cards impotent. We were confused by the scoring rules - the rules seemed clear but when we finished both games, we didn't reach an obvious conclusion as to who'd won.

RATING: 8
Initial rating of 8. This is exactly what it says it is...Samurai with cards. The gameplay feels like Samurai, the scoring is exactly like Samurai, but the one twist makes a big difference in strategy. Instead of having the entire board set up ahead of time so you can plan where you want to go, the board is built as you play. You always know what the next Village (scoring card) will be, so you can use that information to make your choices in card play. 

Basically, if you like Samurai you'll like this. If you don't, you won't. Nice quick game with basically 0 setup time.

More portable version of Samurai however the cards will spread out to occupy a very large area so it's not a travel game in that sense. The main difference with the board game is the evolving map with an extra decision layer of where to place the new village tiles. Personally, I liked it. I prefer the board game but can see playing either when the mood strikes. Traded away.

RATING: 5
This is the archetype of a Knizia game: very abstract, very well balanced, precise rules, good depth ... and once again incredibly boring.  It's once again one of his standard designs: seen it, been there, played it, put it back in the shelf, don't expect to ever play it again.

I really appreciate some of Knizias more brilliant games like "Modern Art" or "Wer war's?" but I'm simply sick of this seemingly endless stream of dull & abstract games.

RATING: 4
What a disappointment. All the incredible strategy of Samurai is just thrown out here. Nothing is left but an exercise in short term optimization. I can't imagine a scenario where I'd choose to play this over the original.

I can't think of a reason why I'd play this instead of the original board game version. Samurai: The Card Game is an ok game with one fairly clever new mechanism, but the original is an absolute classic and simply a far superior game.

Samurai: The Card Game seems to be fairly expensive, which is hard to understand: its just a deck of disappointingly bland and filmsy cards/tiles and a couple of scoring markers.

First of all: I own AND love the original boardgame version of Samurai (I've rated it 10). This cardgame version... well, it sucks. It looks ugly, it plays slowly because the "board" is built via the gameplay and that's why it's hard to make any longtime strategies. And what is the worst thing with this cardgame is that all the scoringmarkers are visible... Auts!

RATING: 7.4
As Samurai is my all-time favorite designer's game I had high hopes (even if I didn't think it can be as god as Samurai) and at the same time I feared it would be a serious letdown. Actually it works well, really feels more like a card game in the vein of Battle Line and others (so it has a bit higher luck factor and a bigger emphasis on tactic and not strategy) while it's still Samurai: I really like it! See my detailed review [thread=460341]here[/thread]. 
Just a little update after playing it with "let's get some action!" AT-lovers: The game is a thinking game. Without having time to think (10 seconds was already too much for them!) it becomes an abstract game with a serious luck factor. It shines with thinking approach.

No real reason to play this game, since the boardgame is clearly superior (and while this is more portable, it ends needing more table space; it is nor even shorter... or much of a card game at all).
Another title produced by Knizia merely recycling (poorly) some of his old good ideas.

Different enough to the boardgame to be worth checking out.  Needs more table-space than it's predecessor too!  Possibly the most important decisions are where to place the next village(s) when you have the benefit of seeing what's coming up next  - and that's a decision you don't get to make in the board version.

Pretty cool as a card version of Samurai.  Other than missing the tactics of the Ronin, swapping the figures, and the ships, this is a decent distillation of Samurai into cards.  

After a few plays, not liking this as much as Samurai.  Might get rid of it.

Still, it's small enough to take with you to a restaurant, on a trip, or out backpacking!  You'll just have to ditch the enormous box first.

Seems like a clever puzzle game. 

The cards are square shaped and the quality is good.
There are city cards which give out a circle, square or triangle once they are surrounded by 4 of the players cards.
Depending on who played the highest total of the matching symbol (samurai are wild) wins the matching piece.

As cards are placed if two opponents cards are adjacent you play a new city card and the board grows.

Scoring is the same as Samurai the Board game.

Maybe it would be good not to get too thinky for your first few games as I could see people being turned off by the game slowing down.

A little more rigid than its big-brother which changes the feel of the game slighly. There's still the agonising decisions and the tension but it's perhaps more constant in the card-game version while the board game has a gradual tightening. At some point in the game you're going to look at your hand of cards and be thinking "Oh god, if I do that then that might get me that but then it gives her a chance to do that but.. oh god... aargh!" and then your brain explodes. I kind of like that in a game.

First and last play. Wow, I thought I would never rate a Knizia game so low, he is one of my group's favourite designers. Unfortunately, he seems to be succumbing to the lure of quick money. What else could explain this piece of garbage of a game, other than trying to make more money off an old idea? He has taken a classic design like Samurai and destroyed its elegence. The worst part of this game is the random card draw for the "talismans". There is no planning involved, much of the time you get lucky with a card draw which can actually determine the winner. Very poor showing from an otherwise respected designer. I hope its not a trend that he decides to follow.

Better than the original game in nearly every way. Removes the unbalanced 'play multiple' ship cards, adds tactical decision to when and where you create a new village, focuses the game by reducing the slots around a village from 6 to 4 -- the only con is that it takes up a huge amount of table space and is difficult to 'reposition' when it gets too close to the edge of the table.

RATING: 8

---Update: Rating went to 8; after having played many games, this one has really grown on me. Fierce competition from the start and some tricky decisions towards the end. Together with Africa the favourite Knizia of my family.---

A simplified version of the well known boardgame. 

The Pros: without the box very travel friendly. Being a card game, it has a distinctive 'pick up and play' appeal. Lots of direct competition from the start, as the players' tokens are not hidden like in the original boardgame. As mentioned by others, tactics are slightly different here.

The Cons: while the abstract design helps to keep track of the expanding layout, it's dry compared to the beauty of the boardgame. Some clever options of the original are left out.

There just isn't too much of a game in here.  And perhaps I'm starting to tire now of so many games coming out with a card-based version of the original.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this. I love Samurai yet had not heard much about this "spin-off" so was not expecting much. It's quite good and I like it a lot. It is more tactical where Samurai is more strategic. I love that it has almost zero set up time. It plays so beautifully and I find it enjoyable to build the board as we play. 

I do think it becomes very hard to see what's going on near the end of the game once a large volume of cards are on the table... I think the visual design could have been improved to mitigate this.

I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'm a big fan of Samurai, and was doubtful that the card game would live up to its impressive lineage. In fact, Samurai: The Card Game uses similar mechanics but plays very differently and, as might be expected, much more quickly than its predecessor. The card game might not be destined to be a classic like the original Samurai, but it certainly carves out its own niche and merits space on the shelf. For first-time players, my best advice is to concentrate as much on setting up advantageous situations with the placement of cities as you do on winning cities already played. Long-term planning is very much rewarded here!

The gameplay is quite similar to Samurai, but I think it has some nice new ideas. The game takes a lot of space and the graphical design could be way better (the village tiles definetely should be more easy to see just with a glance).

With so many other good games out there, this game is pretty... how should I call it... unsatisfying? Can't really find the right word, perhaps 'mediocre' would be the best way to describe it for me. It doesn't do anything bad, it's just overwhelmed by so many other games. I thought 'Samurai' wasn't too bad as a Euro-game, but I think this one is 'mweh'. And it doesn't have anything to do with Samurai. Boo!

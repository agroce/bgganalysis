Great game that can go to the last d. throw!
Lots of interesting choices as the campaign unfolds. 

Allies must press hard to avoid axis sudden death and keep the pressure on.

Use your assets wisely and really tune into the sequence of play to master this fabulous system!

Just like Bulge with the same pros and cons.

This game is more complicated that a three.  Why does GMT consider it low complexity game?  There is just way to much gobbledygook that one has to remember and constantly look up in the rulebook.

They made a few changes in the rules that have improved the game.  I. E. with the old rules one could interdict a supply path through an  area controlled by the opposing player which does not have an opposing unit by just having a unit next to the area.  In the Bulge Game it made it very easy for the Allies to cut off the German Supply Path.

In spite of its flaws, we still enjoy playing it.

Initial Impression: Another solid entry in the FAB system. This game takes everything that was good about the FAB games and adds variability and uncertainty in the starting setup. Naval bombardment, functional airborne units, flanking rangers, and conditional assets are just a few of the exclusive additions to this game that give it a different flavor from the others. So far I'm enjoying this game.

Same awesome system as in FAB:Bulge, but in a new setting. Very cool game - the only problem is that the longish playtime means it wont get played as often as it deserves.
The developer work on the game is by far the best I have seen in any wargame!
Awesome playaids and a VERY comprehensive set of playexamples so this should be relatively easy to learn for someone new to the FAB series.

After two plays I like this game.  This is my first block game and I must admit I like the mechanics.  The game gives you great choices as to how to use the assets at hand.  Do you reinforce a battle or add replacements, put units in reserve etc.  Will add more to my comment once I have played the tournament game and campaign game.  So far I would recommend this game

My first experience with the FAB series. Despite other comments, I felt that it did play quickly. I was very eager to see how the less bloody combat resolution was handled. It worked well, but I found the attacker's ability to retreat with minimal losses a bit frustrating, regardless of how effective the abstraction. Oddly, it has the effect of making being the defender a bloody business. I liked the idea of e assets, but, once again, in practice I was less than wowed. It felt a bit too hand-management and not spatial enough. I feel that perhaps I was not attacking across a broad enough front to soak up his chits. But still... I'm eager to play more, though. I just was expecting a new level in block gaming and didn't really feel it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game has some interested ideas, and tries to innovate. The asset mechanism is indeed interesting and forces the players to make tough decisions at times, as to how much to focus on specific attacks or defenses. The blocks seem unnecessary though, because they are so few that no credible fog of war can be assumed. Overall I liked playing the game, but the rule fiddliness to fun ratio turned out to be quite low for me. I would hate, every 3 months I want to play the game to have to figure out the system intricacies from scratch. A good design, but not developed and streamlined enough.

+ The assets are a great idea and where most of the decision-making goes
+ Interesting tip-toeing tactical area-control play due to the limited terrain
+ Great components and art

= Low unit density means less to track, but also diminishes the epic feeling

- The rules seem simple, but  the interaction between assets and units results in one too many rules exceptions
- Staff actions, special actions, engineering actions, events... could have been further abstracted for no loss at all
- It felt theme-breaking to use assets from one division to help another
- The disordered/recovery units have very limited impact, seemed underdeveloped

RATING: 5
Half a play in and we decided to call it, never a good sign. 

Definitely weaker than FAB: The Bulge, as the lower unit density and zone restrictions make the fog of war much less relevant, and the move & attack options much less interesting, especially for the Axis. The lower density also means a single high-low in a major battle could be game ending.

It was apparent both to myself and opponent that this is a game best played solitaire, too, since the Axis will have precious little to do, at least in the tourney scenario. The rest is largely centered around asset allocation and, while this is important, and there are some interesting twists with naval and air power, it does not a game make.

I also think the copious number of elite Allied units is overstated and makes any thoughts of a counterattack by the HG division borderline suicidal.

Also, I'm just finding the whole system very fiddly. Not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game on a battle that I knew little about. The weight of the game is really on the Allies, since they have the bulk of the special rules and that the conflict is really theirs to lose. Pay close attention to line of supplies and potential holes in the line.
Plays really fast as advertised and as such lends itself really well to repeated plays. Already thinking what i would do differently next game i'll play.

One of my absolute favorite wargame series.  Great system.  I've posted reviews of this and FAB: Bulge if you want to know more.  The alt setup only helps provide value to the whole package.

At first glance, I thought the situation was slightly less compelling than Bulge.  With enough play, I don't think that is true.  The Axis have some very important decisions to make.  They will have opportunities for 1-3 big counterattacks, since the schedule is so tight for the Allies.  They have to take them and get a VP or two from units.  The Axis has the 2 best blocks in the game and, if the stars align, can luck into a brief air superiority window to batter exhausted attackers who rolled poorly in the previous phase.  They must also make very careful use of their engineers to bring down the right bridges, balanced against the destruction of port facilities.

The Allies are confronted with a more esoteric and frustrating conundrum of channeling their vast superiority into tight areas.  If the Allies had the frontage and didn't have to land on the beaches, the game would be over in 2-3 turns.

In my experience the tournament scenario is, despite your first glance, carefully balanced.  I am less sure about the longer campaign game.  One way to play it out is to play to the tournament scenario end and declare a winner.  At that point, you and your opponent can see if the situation is interesting enough to go on and finish the campaign.

Highly recommended.  I like it just as much as FAB: The Bulge.

RATING: 7.5
Second volume of this great series. Sicily is an interesting WWII campaign, but maybe it is not the best choice for FAB system, because the Axis side must be always on the defensive, with very little attack options (it is more enjoying when both players launch offensives along the game). Anyway, this is a nice game.

Another great addition to the FAB series.  Less armored units means it is much more of a push and fewer chances for an armored breakout.  However, the fragility of the Italians, the way that Air Superiority swings to the Allies, and the general requirements of speed makes this a great if asymmetrical game.

After 4 years on the shelf, this finally hit the table with a not good result.

There are a lot of fiddly rules that have minimal impact on the game (port damage, untried units, dogfighting).  The strategy for either side is also very limited, the moves you have to make are fairly obvious once you get all the rules and victory conditions.

The elite status of several Allied formations is also very suspect.  I don't imagine the Germans win much with a reasonably skilled Allied player.

Great new installment of the FAB system. 

It plays very different indeed from the Bulge, with most combats usually evolving into tight and gruelling slugfests which take a pretty high toll in both contenders. 

The alternate landing rule for the Allies is a smart trick that seems to make the game very replayable. 

Looking forward to many more titles in this wonderful series.

I'm still not sure how I feel about this system. It will require more plays. Assets are crucial to this game, and yet they're pulled randomly from a cup? There's a lot of dice rolling in this game as well, which I don't mind, I just didn't expect it at first.
Update:
A second play and greater familiarity of the rules has made me bump my rating up to an 8.5. Lots of tense moments and difficult decisions to be made for both sides throughout the game. I'll probably try to hunt down a used copy of the first FAB game.

this is not bad. It is FAB after all. Unfortunately for my group Sicily worked much worse than Bulge. We did not like that allies which are attackers are not much stronger and they are even less mobile than Italian/German player.

(Rating based on one play)

FAB is a really nice system, though not everything is perfect. Some thoughts in random order:

- Lots of chrome (Patton soldier slap!). The best thing is that the system allows to add tons of chrome and not complicate the game too much.
- I don't have a slightest idea how the Germans could win. Actually, same goes for FAB The Bugle. I suspect the designer might have something against the Germans...
- Rulebook is very well written in the sense that it answered all the questions we had during play. However separating the rules into series rules (common for all games in the series) and volume series (specific to Sicily game) is a bad idea - looking things up takes a lot more time than it should.
- On the one hand game system is very elegant. The game sequence is very well thought. But on the other hand it's kinda complex and throughout the game we couldn't memorize it and kept doing everything using Extended Sequence of Play. Also, we had to check the rulebook every 4-5 minutes because there are lots of tiny details that are easy to forget.
- Fast Action Battle is actually a misnomer - it's not fast at all. Playing a single turn took us about an hour. Setup also requires around 20-30 minutes.
- Gamey, especially at the end of game when the players have absolutely no reason to care about their assets. Just turn them all into cannon fodder, they don't count as VPs anyway. That's bad.
- Great player aids and fabulous playbook - around 25 pages of playing examples.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not a bad game but I would re-title the series Fiddly Action Battles. For the small amount of units in on the map it takes longer than you'd think to play. There is a lot of chrome and exceptions to keep track of and the assets sub-process takes time.
A "Block" game with 228 counters? Kind of defeats the purpose? Seems like design/feature creep took over and the developers forgot about the Fast part. 

Definitely missing the "Fast" part of the sub-title, I guess compared to Case Blue it is.

Did I say I didn't think the game was all that fast? :-P

Rating provisional until further play.

Quick and simple framework system slightly over complicated by a lot of chrome-y rules for each module. Overall it's still quite easy to learn by comparison, but not as easy as a first glance would lead one to believe.

Played both sides a couple of times, and each time the Allies land, quickly grab a few VP zones enough for a minor win, then camp out. Nothing the Axis can do about it, as the Allies are too strong to dislodge, and there is no incentive for the Allies to do more.  With lots of other games to play this is unlikely to hit the table again.

RATING: 7.9
What I like the most is the tension - the victory conditions are well balanced, and since turn 5 both sides are hard pressed – the victory hangs in a balance.

I also like unlocking the unit movement allowance into the allied areas - situation is especially interesting for Americans where you have to decide whether you wait and wish for a chit which unlocks their entire army, or you unlock an unit or two – perhaps more?
 
Also, alternative invasions give the game some nice replayability.

Excited about this game. The rule book is clear, and the several examples of play really help to learn the game.  Very nice map (but still hope the mounted map will be published..).  A very flexible system make this game quite re-playable - the allies can f.i. try alternative non- historical landings which will lead to completely different games. 

Edit after 5 plays: I have only played as Allies. I still enjoy the game, and could play more. Very tough for there allies to maneuver as the terrain makes it difficult in terms of negative modifiers in combat. Aside from geographical objectives is important to try to eliminate axis units for VP's. Asset management make for interesting long term decisions. Very good game.

not only do the defensive assets dominate the game, they actually heavily punish the (historically successful) axis strategy of intermixing german and italian forces in order to 'encourage' the italians to fight hard.

update: was initially playing wrong, so some of above not applicable. but rating the same, impossible to get US island-run and the stacking is waay too low. looking at other games, the stacking limit should be about 6 in clear. the game works better increasing stacking to 4 in clear, 3 in 'rough'.

RATING: 3
The [b]Fast Action Battle[/b] system combines the worst parts of block wargames, chit–pull, and area movement, for a truly unique (and awful) experience. The addition of blocks adds nothing to the system, except perhaps for ease of showing more than two step losses for units (and the accruing of experience). The fog of war aspect is mostly pointless, as you always know what your opponent has by simple deduction. The asset system is a random chit–pull, which makes little sense and adds even more randomness to an already dicey block wargame. The ability to cancel a combat for a disordered result as an attacker, but not as a defender, leaves the distinct feeling of being cheated of a victory. 

One can only imagine how other games on Allied Invasion of Sicily campaign would be absolutely broken by attackers being able to cancel any unfavourable combat results for a minor negative DRM in future combat. In this simulation of the campaign, the hard fought delaying actions in Sicily are represented not as actual combat, but the Germans continually retreating. The Italian garrisons and tried units serve as minor roadblocks to the overwhelming Allied assault and have little chance of doing any damage whatsoever.

I couldn't see why some commented FAB Sicily didn't move along quickly. Once you learn the system I feel it moves along well at a brisk pace. After playing it the first time, I wanted to play it again, then after the second game, I felt bad it had to end. A very nice game and I tip my hat to Rick Young for designing a fun game to play. I hope to get the Bulge one too. 
I played the game solitaire and while it would play differently as a two player game, I thought it played well enough solitaire. I believe this is due to the Axis player not knowing the strengths of the Italian garrisons.

After a few plays, I don't like it quite as much as Bulge.  It feels like it rewards steamrolling by the Allies, taking advantage of their huge asset draws and overwhelming air power to attack along a broad front.  Not as fluid a situation as Bulge.  I still love the system, though, and I can't wait to see Golan.

EDIT: I did a couple of solo plays recently and I'm seeing more potential for the Axis.  I think they need to be very aggressive during the first couple of turns, before the Allies get their overwhelming air power working and the Italians start surrendering.  It's piqued my interest again.

A nice change from the typical Columbia block game.  I like the combination of blocks and assets.  Despite the length of the rules, the game is fast and relatively easy to play.  Seems reasonably balanced so far.

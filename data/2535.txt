Chaotic and fun game of survival in the prehistoric era. Lots of (hilarious) player screwage.

RATING: 5
This is quite possibly the hardest game I have ever rated.  Some aspects are sensational - the theme, how food is gathered, the changing of the seasons are all exceptional.  This game is oozing, gushing, dripping with theme.  On the other hand the frustration level is huge.  A bad card can pretty much take the leader down to almost elimination.  The game can literally go on forever, and there is the possibility of elimination.  It also feels more like you're playing the game rather than other people.

RATING: 8
Best played with four or fewer, as the fifth guy is forced to start out in no-mans-land, and is usually killed off rather quickly.

I haven't tried the "advanced" rules (w/ fire), but it's a decent enough game wiht the basic rules.  Luck definitely plays a role in the game (lots of die rolling going on), but there are some interesting decisions to be made.

The game was going great.  Then a single card wiped me off the board.  Nasty I have no problem with, unbalanced game play I do.  Combat takes rolls and rolls and rolls to resolve (think risk) and I don't mind that.  One card removed the combat and resulted in a crushing defeat.  That card is WAY too powerful.  If I had fought and lost, that's fine.  Being destroyed because player A got death card B?  Sorry, not interested in playing again...

Was a fun beer and pretzel game, but had a couple of large flaws in my opinion. First the game was WAY too long. For as light hearted as this seems, it was about 2 hours too long. The other was that it needs 3 players at least, and as a point I only get games that can play at 1-2 at the minimum.

I have a soft spot in my heart for woolly mammoths, and when I read "You'll have fun; so will the mammoths" on the box cover, I knew I had to buy this game. In our first two plays, everyone who went up against a mammoth was stomped flat! Hooray for the woolly mammoths! This is an entertaining game with hilarious artwork (I wish I could buy a t-shirt bearing the art from the "Amazons" card). If you enjoy caveman antics and can keep your sense of humor even when facing catastrophic reversal, you should play this game.

Faidutti's professionalism shines 20 years ago,by creating a fun game of sweetspot complexity with magnificient cartoon sketches and fulfilling gameplay.Better than Evo.My only concern is that it should have a second victory condition in case it takes too long.Perhaps multiple attempts of instantly owning 4+ tents.

= La Vallée des Mamouths

Het blijft een zeer humoristisch spel.  Door de hulpkaartjes is het ook niet zo moeilijk speelbaar voor spel-fanaten.  Begin er beter niet aan met niet-fanaten, want de gevechtsregels zijn toch niet simpel en het duurt best wel heel lang.

Met 5 of 6 heb ik het gevoel dat je for-ever bezig kan blijven.  Beter met 4.  Alhoewel.

Ik ga het spel verkopen, want het speelt gewoon niet vlot, dus ik wil het zelf liever niet meer voorstellen om te spelen.  Ander en beter.  Plaats ruimen in de kast.

I've played this game twice so far, and both times were very enjoyable.  The theme is fun, but the game can go on forever.  You can be barely hanging on at one point and then quickly move into first place, then get wiped out again, etc.  Either we're playing wrong, or we need to tweek the rules to shorten the game somehow!

Discovered this game Jan 2005.  I played a 5 user session.  What appealed to me was the funny theme, we laughed a lot of times.  It was very hard to go through the manual but I am glad we didn't give up !  Play length was rather long : 2.5 hours for our 5 players session, but this was our first play.

Thought I would love this one -- A civ buiding game where living through the winter is a major challenge.  We played a rule wrong and had way too many kids the first summer, resulting in many starvations the next winter.  The cards felt to me like genes did in Urland, but of course there is no auction for them.  Didn't finish in 2.5 hours.  Probably not worth trying again.

RATING: 7.5
Es un juego ambientado en la prehistoria. Cada jugador gestiona una tribu. El objetivo es conseguir cuatro asentamientos en el mapa. Cada jugador debe gestionar su tribu de manera que se asegure su progreso y su supervivencia. A medida que crece la tribu, mayor necesidad de comida.. que se obtiene a partir de los animales que van apareciendo en cada turno, y a partir de la explotación de recursos naturales. Hay posibilidad de eliminación de jugadores. Pueden ocurrir todo tipo de eventos que echen por tierra cualquier planificación.... así que no es un juego ajedrecístico. La suerte tiene bastante peso, y la victoria, depende de cómo se adapte uno a las circunstancias que van ocurriendo, y de que no suceda algún desastre que lo pille de lleno. Es bastante entretenido. 
Tiene una estética de "dibujillos" que le hace parecer un comic, pero es un juego serio. Volvería a jugar gustoso.

This is a bridging game for your kids because it begins to teach some strategic elements while providing enough fun and randomness to give a level playing field. There are plenty of fun cards to keep everyone interested and some interesting random mechanics. The only thing to puzzle over is the topless ladies on the counters. It is just weird for a fimaly game.

A game which really makes you feel like a Neanderthal and whose style is outright hilarious (although real Neanderthals can't possibly have had much to laugh about judging by the game).  Besides, there's a card titled "Homopower" in it [German edition] -- that alone is reason enough to own it. ;-)

Great design by Bruno Faidutti and wonderfull pictures drawn by Gerard Mathieu.

So funny game, so much luck involved but still... so much strategy.

We don't play with the fire optional rule because because we think it unbalance the game between the tribes and make the animals less powerfull.

We always play with the animal/vegetal optional rule (You can keep excess meat and fish from one turn to another but you can store vegetal products). this make the game very tough for the humans ... most of the time, when bloody war erupts between the tribes the animals decimate the tribes and the game wins against all the players.

So fun !

Funny game. The only thing is that everything in the game is against you (the climate, the animals, the other players).
 Also, the game can change fast (and that´s a good thing). At the end of the summer I have just one camp, one man and an woman (the other had 3 or 2 camps). After the winter the other players lost almost all theirs camps and I was able to build two more camps. The problems is that if this keep happening with all players the games goes forever...

I thought I would love this game also.  Have played two 2-player games and lost both in under an hour.  Fast.  Second time, I lost half my people and camps due to fire.  I might change the rule next time or not put so many eggs in one basket.  Game does have a nice "feel" to it, it does feel like you are living during caveman times.  Too many phases though to suit me.

Misogyny in board game form; lucky it was guy's night.  Chaos reigns as you make short-lived tactical decisions in an utterly random and unforgiving environment.  If you mistake this thing for anything other than a passtime you will be unhappy.  For all the laughs, Valley deserves a higher rating but I'm reserving the top spots for actual games.  Just a bunch of stuff that happens, I grok this game.  NOSTALGIA UPGRADE.  I wish I could play this right now with my old group.  Great stuff.  UPDATE. PWND!!

Talk about a brutal game.  There's a flood - you die. There's a volcano - you die.  Another tribe moves into the area - you die.  It gets cold - you die.  No food - you die.  Notice the theme.  Your tribe spends more time dying than anything else.  You'd think I didn't like this, but you'd be wrong.  First of all, the artwork is awesome.  Second, you really have to think to win this one.  It really is a challenge, and I like challenging games.  I will definitely give this one another try.

Can you say "oog"? Players try and nuture a tribe of B-Movie cavemen (and women!) through a dangerous valley full of wolves, bears, sabre-tooth tigers, opposing tribes, and of course, mammoths! Men and women form new camps and rear new offspring. Tribe members have to be fed via a combination of crops, foraging, fishing and hunting (mammoth steak!). Raids on other tribes can bring rewards of food, new camps and women. First to hold four camps for two turns wins. Rather chaotic, thanks to events and action cards, but great fun.

RATING: 9
Two double-sided modular hard map boards, a deck of playing cards with funny pics and plenty of counters for up to 6 players complete the box. All of quality materials.  You are found in the Palaeolithic era. You have to set a primitive camp and after long hardships augment it to 4 camps to win the game. Goal is simple in theory; in practice you have to discover the art of fire, of swimming, farming and hunting. Do not take things for granted: nature is against you, wild animals want to get a taste of you, seasons bring several events, volcanoes can erupt anytime and the board cannot hold and feed so many players and camps. On top of all these you must take care feeding and defending your camp so as to grow up and give you more inhabitants that will spread out and form new camps. Very funny and interactive play with lots of surprises and unanticipated results each game turn. 

For more events and flavor you have to acquire the French edition of “La Valee des Mammouths: L'extension”

Valley of the Mammoths can be a very, very long game. Too long for what it give you. Very choatic and some random elements. Luck can easily be a factor on who wins the game.

Theme is interesting. The event cards can be a real bitch. You got very little control on what happens with your tribes. Your tribes struggle the whole game. 

If you want to torture yourself playing a game which never ends, this game is for you.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play Valley of the Mammoths any time soon.

I have the new edition by Jeux Descartes. It plays nicely, very dependent on the action cards and a few lucky dice rolls. But a good game of management. I liked the fact that food supply really mattered and that winters were harsh. It's much more about surviving harsh conditions than fighting wars. Fun, but it helps to have played it before.

Even though I won the only game I ever played of this, it was an unenjoyable experience.  I did not enjoy the extremely arbitrary and powerful cards, which completely broke the game; nor the inevitable bash-the-leader-until-someone-wins-by-exhaustion endgame which I so heartily detest as a game design.

Played a few times to settle on this score.  The board offers few optimal placements that can be well defended; the animals come in a random and sometimes destructive waves or if they can be slaughtered award food boosts to the lucky bystanders; like most games of the genre, it pays to keep a low profile and hope for an opportune moment for a final blow and that is if you can manage the vagaries of weather, events and opponents.  Plundering and stealing brides can get old.  And it has for me.

In my one play, I went through two phases with this game:
(1) Wow, this game is cool!  The artwork and cards are hilarious, the theme is fun, and it looks like it's going to finish in half an hour or so!
(2) My God, this game is never going to end, I'm about to get eliminated, my head hurts.  But the artwork is still fun to look at.  

Overall, there just wasn't enough game to keep me interested for 2 hours.  For the first hour, I give the game a solid 8/10.  For the second hour, 6/10.  We'll average it out to a 7.

I highly recomommend this game to gamers and people that like brutal cutthroat games.

Valley of the Mammoths is a game you don't play as much as you survive it.  I can't really say it's a game of skill.  Animals move in a completely random way.  Events can completely kill off almost all of your tribe.  The other players can gang up on you at any time.  It's random as hell, but I still enjoy it, in an almost masochistic way.  It's like life:  You do your best and shit just happens, you try you deal with it the best you can, and sometimes is just down right funny when you try so hard and fail miserably for no fault of your own.  Like when a Woolly Mammoth tramples the crops, you where planning on using to feed your tribe.  When a forest fire roasts your guy that was just trying to fish.  When another players tribe gets killed by a pack of wolves.  In the end the game goes on for to long, but it's tongue planted firmly in cheek fun.            
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Extremely chaotic and luck-driven, but it may also be a lot of fun with the right group or mood. I just happen no longer to be in that mood often. And even if you don't care much about who wins, the game may be a little frustrating at times, when bad die rolls completely ruin your winning strategy. Also, the playing time is very variable and the game often takes too long, especially considering the amount of randomness it has. Besides, players may be eliminated long before it's over.

RATING: 6
A light game where event cards make pre-planning your moves next to impossible.  Fortune cards keep the game fresh as your opponents have no idea what your tribe can do to respond to an attack.  Need to be in the right mood to play this.

The game is centered on gathering food in order to survive and expand your tribe.

There is a lot of randomness, but it keeps the game interesting.

If your tribe can survive the first winter, then you're doing something right  ;-)

Rated mostly from memories of one session that lasted many hours and was started late, late at night. However, some games can be over very fast (too fast), and some can drag on long (too long). With a bit of luck, you get a game of exactly the right length, then the game is very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
I thought this was an excellent themed game, but took a little too long to play.  I'd like to see some kind of point earning system attached to the game and then first person to X points wins.  The bash the leader thing makes the game a little more harsh and dependent on players policing each other up.  If this could be fixed, I think it would be an awesome civ game.

This game HATES the players. I've seen a players healthy, large tribe die in a single turn after a rock slide (played by other player) crushed his camp and a forest fire made barbeque out of his cavepeople. Evil, evil game. And fun to play in small ammounts. Due to player elimination some players may have to sit on the sides a long time if they get taken out of the game during the critical and difficult to survive starting turns.

We had one 6 player game in which none of the players' bands of cavemen survived.  As long as you and your fellow players are OK with the mayhem that this game can inflict, it can be very fun.  If you are playing this one as a deeply strategic endeavor, you are doing it wrong.

RATING: 9
I like this as a 2 player & as a multiplayer. The funny cards make it less serious than the average wargame. The flaw is that it can drag rather than ending, because when one player nears the winning condition of 4 villages, the others attack. A partial fix is to set a time limit, usually 3 years, & award a point chip per village at season end, along with the definite win at keeping 4 villages. I really don't understand why it is rated so low on BGG.

Bought purely for the mayhem. Unplayed, no one's been willing to give it a go yet, but it's been opened--and the silliness is apparent; it looks to be a game of pure messing with everyone in a chaos loving way; get into the spirit and let it go! 

It was a fantastic deal when I picked it up, the art made me laugh. It looks wicked (and like it encourages wickedness), wild, AND wacky. I think, if every one knows that going in, it could be a damn lot of fun.

How to explain it to the group...."Ok, look everyone, expect to die, be crushed, starved, have your women stolen, and to do the same to the other poor b'strds round this table." The key? Laugh it all off and rejoice in the ebullient mayhem.

RATING: 7
Great Fun! My favorite French game. I changed the set-up to everyone choosing a camp that borders the edge of the board because there are definatelly unfair starting positions. Also I changed Animal/Human combat to a maximum of +1 if you outnumber your opponent because at +3 0r 4 it's almost impossible to win. I heard there is errata that corrects some of these small problems on the website. Sold it for $25.

RATING: 5
Update: Nope, not playing again. Random desasters can be fun when they create a good story and if you have a chance to mitigate the results to some degree. But it's not worth playing for two hours until elimination while never being in the game in any meaningful way. At least one player per game will suffer this fate.
---
8 months after trading it away I finally played this game on a friend's copy after owning it for 18 years without ever playing it. Time wasn't gentle to this design. It is chaotic, it can take ages to complete as everyone bashes the leader and worst of all players can be eliminated. Still, I enjoyed my game. Might have helped that I won but it even was fun when an avalanche overrolled my fourth hut on a 1:6 chance. But one player was hit so bad that he was out of the game after four turns. I'll give it a 6/10 and I even regret it a bit trading it away.

Interesting and thematic caveman game. Humorous at points, but ultimately a pointless game. Much like Civ, where random events and animals can just wipe out your cavemen. At the end of the day, the tribe who are luckiest and survive the longest win the game.

RATING: 5
A recent play has shown that this has not aged too well. I cautioned everybody new to the game that they should not expect any strategy, but get ready for a wild and wooly ride through all the bad luck the game and the other players could throw at them. Even I, though, had forgotten how brutally unfair an experience can await you in the valley, and how long the game can seem if you’re kicked out of the race for the win early on.

For a pure adventure/experience game, there is a plethora of newer titles that provide either a quicker game or at least a modicum of viable strategy. Getting something on the table that will eliminate players through no fault of their own while possibly lasting for two long hours is neither realistic, given the reactions of those in our group just introduced to it, nor is it something I’m particularly keen on.

Nevertheless, I feel that this is a game everybody should play at least once, if only to train their capability to accept defeat gracefully. It is rather unique in its unflinching brutality, and the pairing with the excellent cartoonish artwork makes for a very particular kind of fun. Me, I’ve had my fill, and the memories of the eventful times I had in the Valley of the Mammoths will hold up just as well without the game on my shelves.

Looks great!  The cards are hysterical.  It's pretty good, but too often in a 5 player game someone dies out during the first winter before they really even get a chance to play.  Lots of laughter in the box, but sees little attention from the group.  Just not that much fun.

I really want to like this game, but after two playings I´m not sure it will hit the table very often in the future. It falls between the categories of light and medium heavy games. Funny pictures and nice atmosphere, but it´s hard for players to build a base to work from. Perhaps the harsh conditions are too `historical´.

It's sort of a wargame in that you fight other tribes and there can be player elimination.  It's heavily steeped in theme:  you need to feed your tribesmen through hunting, growing crops, fishing or foraging.  There are different events and game effects through the summer and winter months.  Animals come onto the board and move around, some can cross rivers, some can cross mountains, they all will form herds when meeting animals of the same type.  You grow your tribes by having babies and their are different fighting rules for men and women.  

You need to go into the game knowing that you need to survive against both your opponents and the game system.  The events, etc. are largely unpredictable but make for a fun narrative and some interesting challenges.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I bought this game because of the rating here on BGG and the designer.  

I enjoy the game and Knightmare Chess meets Civ might be an apt description. No trade or advancements, but there is conflict, expansion, wild animals to deal with and lots of disasters.  More than enough misery to go around.  Rather cartoonish graphics given the serious thumping that players will be receiving.

A lot of randomness, but good thematic feel, which I found enjoyable but may be a turnoff to some people.  Game system is certainly lethal and can readily kill off all the players, which is probably "realistic" and perhaps "fun" depending on how you like your games.

The best thing about Valley of the Mammoths is the wacky, fun atmosphere surrounding the game.  It's chaotic and crazy the whole time, and it is really built for laughs.  The strange thing is that the game actually has a fair amount of strategic considerations, but this is morphed by the weird marriage to a lighter feel and atmosphere.

While Valley of the Mammoths is fun, it isn't very forgiving, and luck plays a very large role.  If you're okay with things going crazy, and wildly differently powered cards and effects, than you will really get into the theme and humor of this game.  But if you try to focus too much on the strategic elements, which are there, you will often find yourself frustrated by the game itself.  A good fun game, but best when treated as a light experience.

A very fun game to play. It definitely is more of a thematic game rather than standard euro with a paste-on theme. Game mechanics are good too but there is so much unpredictable elements that you cannot plan too much ahead. You really don't want to play this one too seriously. Hardest thing in the game actually isn't to beat up your opponents; Winter is the real killer. You'll be happy for every new summer you see... Only real minus there really is is the player elimination which counts as a minus in a game this long. I really like how the game is fun to play and I rate it higher than most games of this type.

The more players there are in this game, the more cutthroat it is as empty spaces quickly gets taken up. I like the seasons concept as the harsh winter would normally whittle down your tribe strength and even more so when you don't plan properly. What I do not like about the game is that it tends to be a little on the long side. Meaning that players tend to spend a lot of time thinking of what to do when it comes to moving their tribes. The game, while the art maybe cute, has too many fiddly pieces and the rule book is ont entirely clear on certain points namely which animal is which or what the blank wolf pieces are for.

One play, five players, Christmas 2010.

A typical game of the early 1990s, Valley of the Mammoths is an ultra-light multi-player hex-and-counter war game with a cute theme.

There's particularly nothing special or unique about this game other than its theme. Its wide familiarity among Euro gamers probably stems from the the fact that its designer is still popular.

Our five player game was mercifully short, probably because we weren't paying too close attention to ganging up on the leader.

When it come down to it, you can't take this game too seriously but it is entertaining. The game end it similar to Cyclades because the end usually come down to acquiring someone else's huts to win.  That's the only comparison though.  Okay game.

A wild and wacky game of prehistoric survival. The capricious nature of events adds to the experience. Extra credit for the wargame elements.

RATING: 7
This game feels like "After the Holocaust"; the environment is so hostile the other players are mere annoyances by comparison.  Mere survival feels like victory.  I had a hard time rating it because it has definite pros and cons.  Pros: (p1) Excellent theme.  You're always on the ragged edge of survival (unless you're a lucky hunter) and nature is a mother.  (p2) Lots of outrageous fortune in the form of random events.  (p3) Funny as heck.  (p4) Is actually a better wargame than many "wargames" because it models the logistics of a foraging army.  Disperse and you can gather enough to eat, but the other tribes pick you off little by little.  Concentrate and you can defeat other tribes, but you starve (unless big animals come your way).  Cons: (c1) Playing time is quite unpredictable.  (c2) Players can be eliminated, which combined with (c1) can mean ex-players can be watching for a long time.  (c3) Outrageous fortune in the form of uneven game animal distribution.  In my experience the most successful hunters tend to build up the food surplus necessary to gain population and go on the attack.  (c4) A bad player with a grudge can bring another player down with him if he goes on the warpath and doesn't care about starving.  (I know, that's a common problem with multi-player games.)  The cons mean I won't play this game at the drop of a hat (I want to allow for 3 hours), but I've always enjoyed it when I've played it.  It's most fun when all the players laugh at everyone else's misfortune.

Played it at lot at first, but it turned out to be too lucky of a game for me to enjoy. Your entire tribe was at the brink of death every moment, and it was completely out of your control.

I do, however, have a lot of good memories with this one.

A good game with some chaos and fun (like many other ludodelire games).  The rating is 6.5 because unlike the other game, luck is important and you can, even in playing well, be eradicated of the map (even without seen other tribes ;-)  ).

Man, this game gets a bad rap.  Sure it is a little chaotic, but it is a great thematic battle game.  I will say that if you get humped too hard you are effectively eliminated from the game, but if you find that to be an issue, play this as a two player game.  I have no desire to play this with more than three, as you could get caught in the Malachi Crunch quickly and spend the rest of the night watching. 

Quite thematic, with many fun developments, but nothing too out of control as you just don't get that many cards.

I can see how this game could run long if people aren't out to win.  In a larger multiplayer game your interest is in defending your position, and people can keep pegging you to stop the leader from a win (which sucks and is something that we should all realize should be outdated in these games).  With three players that are on the attack, the game should be over quickly.

Lots of fun things going on here.

Great Cards and Artwork, and the way that the elements of fantasy early-human times are all welded together for a choesive game playing experience. This is one of those games where the stunning illustrations on the cards make players hallucinate the game board into a stunning detailed feature-rich visual.

Seemed like this was going to be fun but there's way too many exceptions and irregular turn sequences.  Too much to learn for our group that hops from game to game too quickly.  Print the guide sheets for sure.

It&#039;s too long for such a chaotic game. Many cards are very powerful and make the boardplay feel quite pointless. I would like it better if it would be shorter (or alot less chaotic). The components are great however: they look and feel good.

like Robo Rally this is simply a fun game!  the artwork cartoons are great.  Some tactical and strategic elements here to go along with the luck.  One of my favorite "light" games.

Don't know what it is about this game but I can't get enough of it.  I always want to play.  I actually love the luck aspect of the cards and dice, but I play more for theme and fun than to actually win.  
Update 9 -> 6 :  This was one of my first games ever.  After playing boardgames for quite a few years now, we played it again.  I HATED it.  I am willing to keep the score relatively high for nostalgia sake, but man was it boring.

I've been wanting to play Valley of the Mammoths for a long time, so it was nice to finally try it. I enjoyed it as an experience game, I don't think it's the sort of thing I'd like to play competitively. And it's too long to have some folks eliminated while the rest of us still play, so I'd really only ever play it two player.

Some neat elements here, the way the board fits together in different ways, the way the animals come into the game and merge into herds is very well done. The artwork on the cards is just hilarious, naked guys with their bits hanging out, lots of modern caveman jokes. I love the Terrace card, where instead of normal ground, you can see the hexes of the game board in the background.

I had a hard time figuring out where to rank this game. I don't actually believe in all my plays the group has 'won' a game. We all pretty much go to war, and after a year everyone's dwindled down so much that the natural events and wandering animals finish us off.

That sounds like a bad game, but we have so much fun laughing at each others misery and the goofy cards that it makes for great stories. Like the one time my friend almost won the game 4 times in a single play, but kept having events like volcano's erupt in his face keep him from victory.

It amazes me that so few gamers have an interest in this game! It is so...cool! It combines American and European games in a strange way. I would call it a "Ameropean" game.  The art is fantastic, and the rules make perfect sense. You can play it as a bit of a war game, or just as a territory game.  It really is a surprise when you first play it- you don't expect much, and then BOOM!, you find it is one of your favorite games!

RATING: 7
A game of survival amongst misery and chaos in the stone-age.  Great primitive fun: hunt-n-gather, farm, breed, attack, survive winter.   The two-part map board is double-sided from which four different maps can be setup.  The map is hex-based with four types of terrain.  Although the map is large physically, it feels quite constricted within the game as tribes fan out from their original camps which leads to pretty quick confrontations for new campsites and animals to hunt.  As tribes grow larger the need for food becomes greater, further constricting the map and fueling more confrontations.  Losing battles and a lack of food will result in player elimination, but the game does allow each player a onetime opportunity to re-enter the game with a new smaller tribe.  Combat die rolls, fate cards, event cards, wild animal attacks introduce so much chaos that it is very hard to keep any momentum going and one's position in the game can flip in a blink.

Just revisited this game after a decade+ hiatus and it has aged quite well.  I like the game better now than before, probably because I have drifted away from games with player elimination and lotsa chaos so it feels kinda refreshing.  The game has elements that one might view as crude and/or sexist, but it's quite mild and done with humor.  Player downtime and length of game are what keeps the game from being great. Still a good-n-fun game.

RATING: 5
The fighting/combat is too simplistic, and it takes forever.  Another big concern is finding who this game appeals to: it's off-putting to both family gamers (who find it a bit grotesque and wargamey) and strategy gamers (who find it somewhat silly and chaotic).  So...traded away.

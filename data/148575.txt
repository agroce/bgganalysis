Fun enough game... but I dislike that you have to buy so many packs to put together a playable set. Plus, you're left with tons of dice and cards you'll never even use along with way.

This game is simply a blast. It has what I was hoping for from Quariors, more PVP oriented, customizable teams, and lots of dice! I highly recommend this game if you can find it.

Finally snagged a copy of the starter set from our FLGS. Now I'm just waiting for the booster packs to become more readily available at a reasonable price.

UPDATE: Strike that. We ended up ordering a full set of Commons/Uncommons off eBay. It lacks the fun of ripping open an entire gravity feed of boosters (yay!) but was considerably cheaper and ensures we have pretty much a playable set. We can add to it later.

RATING: N/A
Avengers v X-Men was the first set I bought and I committed early on not to stress to complete the set and I'm glad I didn't. I did introduce the game to a friend and my son and have done some drafting. At this point I have a healthy collection to include a significant amount of cards and dice from:

Avengers v. X-Men
Uncanny X-Men
Age of Ultron
Civil War
Amazing Spider-Man

Justice League
War of Light 
World's Finest

At this point I have stopped purchasing larger amounts and may focus on individual cards and dice.

A game that uses die as a representation of the hero. Favorite memebers of my deck; scarlet witch (SR), goblin lord, falcon-recon, angel-inspiring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I expect my rating to increase over time. I'd rate this higher, except that the quality of the starter's accessories borders on the hilarious, and the packaging of the gravity feed boosters not suitable for cards. The game itself is phenomenal, but you really need two copies of the starter set to have enough dice to fully field a team of those characters. (June 2014, 8/10)

Update: yeah, this is an incredible game system that adds much more depth to the original Quarriors system, lending itself to excellent replayability given the broader strategy. (August 2024, 9/10)

Somewhat fun, but still way too collectible for me. I wouldn't mind it but a lot of points are off here for the fact that the rarer cards ARE, in fact, generally more powerful than the commoner cards.

RATING: 6
It works as a game, but of little interest to me. For a game so apparently thematic, little real story came through - card-abilities appear to have no relation to the characters on the cards. I never felt like I was doing anything beyond rolling dice to beat my opponent's dice. Nice components and an interesting sales-strategy make this stand out from the crowd though. Not a disaster, but not for me.

I like this system. It was very weird at first because I was turned off by the sidekick dice. I just wanted to get in and start Hulk Smashing everything. Of course, it wasn't long before I started bringing in the big guns and realizing that the sidekicks were a perfect distraction for my opponent offering a good balance to the proceedings and evening our sides out. 

What I do like about this game is the fact that the powers feel thematic. The heroes and villains don't feel like a collection of mechanics, but like their powers have dictated what they do on the battlefield. The huge quantity of characters and variations on characters is also a big selling point for me because it allows me to mix-and-match my teams, preventing a whole lot of stale gameplay, which is good because games don't last very long and I'm typically starting up a new one as soon as one finishes.

Interesting game.  I'll never buy it because I don't like collectible games (a.k.a. "money pits") and there wasn't enough to change my mind.  It's an interesting concept.  I can't see a sidekick really stopping the Hulk, but ya got to have a game, right?  I think [thing=129437]Legendary[/thing] did the hero thing better, but this is a nice quick game if you can play somebody else's game.

+ The superhero theme comes through so strong here; Even with the huge amount of luck in the game, your decisions both in team construction and during play will determine how you fare.

I'm pretty open-minded and I know many like this game and system, but I do not.  Rolling and collecting dice and treating the dice like Magic The Gathering cards just doesn't work for me.  Again, many like this game so I'm sure it is better than I am indicating, but for me ... it did not work.

RATING: 2.5
Beautiful dice components with a very basic game system taken from a merger of Magic the Gathering and Dominion/quarriors.

A milestone and Grindstone dice game, using random power rolls to generate an attack/action against an opponent. With more options on newer characters, the game will be less boring. Dice game of this sort usually stagnate as compared to the ever changing ways/numbers/art on card faces.

Since the system has been tried from magic, this game dice it out to mere basics.

The rating is for the designers, that I do not feel their talent here in this design. It felt as a complete rip off.

As a game, I rate it a 5. As I felt the strategy and game play random dicing to be a game that plays the gamer. Nothing like the multi-facet of magic and the decision in dominion. Independently, it lacked in every aspect....fun, strategy, options.

Perhaps if a gamer purchased more random dice, it would provide more options. That is the part I hate in CCGs.

RATING: 7
You can absolutely just buy the base set and have a blast with this game, but of course I had to get too many extra packs and buy some of my favorite comic book characters.  It plays a little like a deck builder, but there's more of a "you vs. the other player" feel as opposed to just playing to optimize your own deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I greatly enjoyed this game when I started. However, it quickly became apparent that the cost of characters relative to their power was far too loose. The presence of any one underpriced (e.g., overpowered compared to the price) character card would basically guarantee a win for one side or another. And the characters don't work together well enough that you can create interactive combos to combat a particular character.

Perhaps there's a variant with more characters per side that would help to render sides towards the mean.

An improvement over Quarriors in mechanics and in theme. Its quite addictive and fun and over rather quickly; but there's still room to find fun combo's and strategy in your team building.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fixes a couple problems with base Quarriors by adding the re-rolls and the global effects, as well as varying the consequences for monsters attacking or dying (go to used pool versus go to re-roll pool)

Then adds a bunch of other bad stuff (collectible-ness, cards that can be actually useless, level being different from cost, and even more randomness in the form of energy types...)

So, it's kind of a wash.

Say no to this game may be better choice.

RATING: 5
Pese a que los heroes Marvel fueron una parte importancia de mi infancia, el juego no me ha terminado de enamorar en las dos demos que he jugado.

La distribución de los boosters y starters ha sido nefasta, pasando ya a la expansión (que no compré) sin haber dado tiempo a asentar el pack básico. Esto no ha ayudado nada. Para colmo de males lo sacan en Castellano próximamente... En fin, todo un despropósito.

Pese a tener una super-rara y cierto material, decido finalmente desprenderme de todo a buen precio.

Siempre he odiado los CCG, y aunque con este piqué por la temática, he podido salir a tiempo sin daños colaterales... algo que refuerza mi opinión de siempre. Son una ruina y cuanto más éxito tengan... peor.

RATING: 6
This is a rather fun dueling game that is ruined by the publishers complete mishandling of the game. By turning it into a collectible game, they've alienated a lot of gamers, and then they couldn't manage the production which further alienated the CCG market. Apologists will claim that production shortages happen, but the publisher launched not one, not two, but three new spin-off lines of the game before fixing the production problems of the first line. The only positive will be finding collections several years from now for pennies on the dollar. That's the only way I'll ever buy into this game.

Extremely poorly written rules that everyone is having trouble with.

This leads to players making up rules to validate their "killer" deck of heroes, of which only 3 might get out.

Favors the low power characters which makes it boring.

House rule more HP and make it fun...

This was the first Dice Masters that I actually played, and its smooth and fun, with cute six-sided dice and mechanics and a collectible marketing scheme that is both affordable ($1 boosters for 2 cards & 2 dice) and also capable of scratching that obsessive itch I used to feel for games like Magic the Gathering. It's harder to find these days but I scored a starter set, and will at some point get some booster packs.

I don't really play this game like a Magic player, in that I don't build teams offline and bring them to the table ready for battle (though I can see the appeal).  Mostly I feel like there is a pretty common consensus as to what the best cards are and rather than devolve into that mess I just like to do little pre-game drafts to assemble the teams.  

In that environment this is a fun, casual, beer & pretzels game that my wife and I both enjoy quite a bit.  There are enough little decisions to keep the mind occupied while the dice rolling/dice drawing makes from some good drama.

RATING: 8
I was never too interested in Quarriors.  Maybe it was the theme, or maybe it was all the crappy reviews it seemed to get.  

The Marvel version was too cool to ignore.  While it may not be "the best" game in the world, it is so easy to pull out and play.  It also happens to be pretty darn fun.

It is a pretty simple battle game at it's core -- similar to Magic the Gathering.  Bring out your heroes and let them smash into each other and see who is left.

Note that I don't really play this game "competitively", where I'm trying to construct the perfect team for tournament play.  I like drafting a team from a random selection of cards and seeing what happens.  More fun that way, with more variety between games.

A much more fun version of Qwarriors.  I like the design and dice, but the random packs are irritating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plays like a mash up of Quarriors and Magic the Gathering with a Marvel theme tacked on. It works well, with the fighting and defending mechanic improving on the Quarriors formula. Good game, though not spectacular, and the collectible nature of the booster packs is not really an issue given their price point.

While the price is very, very good, there's an obvious reason this is cheaper than Quarriors, even with the Marvel licence, and that's the quality of the product. Cheap paper dice bags, flimsy cards that necessitate a sleeve to protect them, and poor printing on the dice with occasional defects add up to a quality of product that won't be a surprise to Heroclix players. Still, a very good game, just be prepared to invest in a few dice bags and sleeves!

Initial Impression: This game feels like more than just a simple reskin of the Marvel universe onto the dice bag mechanisms of Quarriors. My biggest hesitancy with the system is the fiddliness of the dice bag. Although I'm a big Marvel fan, this game just doesn't pull me in. Perhaps a few more plays will help the game "click" with me.

I'll just say this...I haven't been this excited about a game since Heroscape. Our family has been having a ton of fun with this game. We have one starter and less than 30 boosters.

I thought the collectible part would bother me, but it doesn't. In fact I don't think I really need that many cards. Variety is nice, but too many choices makes it take longer to pick teams and get the game going. I'm going to enjoy heading to Target to pick up a few boosters with my boys and then going home to try them out. Although really, all I would like is a few more dice so that I can use some of the characters more effectively and I'm happy. I don't really care about the rare/super rare cards.

RATING: 9
That said, it is one of, or maybe even my favorite, game right now.  I just can't get enough of it.  It is one of three games always want to play three matches of back to back.  I also love the quick deck building aspect of the game.  It takes some time to build decks for Lord of the Rings: the Card Game or Netrunner.  I can build a deck in Dice Masters very quickly.  

That said, there are problems.  I recognize the imbalances of some of the cards, and I understand that the game is far from perfect.  I really can see that some euro leaning individuals would hate this game.  Dice storage is a problem as there are ample dice that can be acquired and it can be annoying to find the right ones.  All of these annoyances melt away when I have built a team or two, and I am ready to play.  It is one of the most fun games I own.

Incredibly fun to play. In my gaming group im the one that has the dice masters stuff, so when we play I do a draft of a random set of cards to see who gets what heroes, that way its a different game every time we play. 20 hero pool and we each draft 8 to play.
There are more then enough cards that no game will ever be the same.

The artwork is so awesome on the cards

My only gripe with the game is the dice are the worst quality dice ive ever seem, and they are all have air bubbles in the middle of the dice.

Not much going on here.  Someone may have to explain to me what the appeal is.  It should be cool, but seems to be only in theory.  The lack of variety in powers and heroes is stifling compared to other deck building type games.  Not to mention the lack of theme integration.

Haven't played Quarriors, so I can't comment on whether or not this is an improvement, but based on the research I've done some of the mechanics seem to have been improved, but regardless of what they've changed it just isn't enough. 

It's a game marketed as an awesome action movie, that is the equivalent of going to the theater, being handed a bag of dice for the price of admission, rolling them for ten minutes, and then having someone come in, saying "that's it. Get out."

Really disappointed.  Still in search of a superhero game for the collection.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Overall the mechanics are pretty solid, except for the fact that defeated heroes get rerolled right away as soon as their turn comes up. Thematically it makes no sense, and gameplay-wise it means that a huge guy can just be repeatedly blocked by sidekicks and other chumps and basically accomplish next to nothing.
If it weren't for that, this game would be pretty fantastic, as it is though, that's a big part of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
I had higher expectations, but it's still pretty fun.  Dice quality is hit or miss along with card print that I noticed.  Be prepared to spend money on dice mats, bags and more cards.  I got a little nostalgia ripping open the $1 packs like baseball cards.  Would suggest ordering up singles from Coolstuff if you want to round out your collection and dice quantity.

3 games of this little beauty, twice with my very willing son, and once with my not so willing wife. It takes a while trying to pick out characters and knowing what everything does, when playing with people new to the game (including me), so it's almost more fun to keep it to 3 basic characters. In the second game, I played, my Gobby just went nuts with his Fielding ability with the sidekicks. He seemed incredibly OP, but I did talk to some people that said there are already some cool defenses against him.I really want to play him against more skilled players, as fielding this against a newb just seems to sap the fun from the game. Do I rate this game high? FOR SURE! Do I rate other games higher? FOR SURE, and it comes down to this learning curve. I don't like where I need to invest so much time just figuring out what characters work together, and knowing that possible opponents need to do the same thing. My FLGS (Boardgame Revolution) are going to start up a monthly tournament, and that sounds like a lot of fun to me. I can learn the game more, and take my boy to play in it as well. My wife probably won't be swinging back to this game any time soon, but she was a sport to play that one time with me.

RATING: 4
Meh, I still don’t care for Dice Masters (I’ve now tried both versions several time; they’re basically the same game). There isn’t that big of a difference between the two editions, perhaps the heroes and dice in this edition is somewhat less polished and interesting? 

The usefulness of some of the cards vary a lot… I think that some cards are clearly a lot better than others, while others seem pointless and some I would never add to my lineup (and others seem too powerful for a cost of 2 etc).

Anyway, Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men has seen a lot of hype, but I’m not buying into it. I think the design is uninspiring and fairly tedious. It reminds me of Magic: The Gathering, which is a widely known and beloved game by many, but a game which I dislike. Also, there is a lot of luck concerning the dice rolls; whether you get enough energy to field your characters – that is, if you even roll your characters…

Really enjoy playing this casually. I've only got 2 starter boxes, no boosters, so I've only played w/the 8 starter heroes. I will eventually buy some boosters once they become available again, but I'm not interested in playing this at the organized level. The environment already looks too much like MtG, where the guy w/the most money spent on the game wins, b/c you need Super Rares to be competitive.

I have 2 starters and one box of boosters and will not be buying more - the collectible model is detestable.

The game itself is fun, with some good layers of strategy and tough decisions to be made, and probably deserves a half, or even a full point higher rating, but there are some flies in the ointment:-

- The collectible model.

- Theme - who is the player supposed to be? I don't really get the lining up of heroes to fight heroes. Surely they could have included some rules that required a hero deck or a villain deck, then it would make sense.

- Some component quality issues - some dice are not inked well, the bags are a joke and the starters should really ship with a playmat.

- The rule book is woeful - completely awful.

- Each version of each hero should have had different artwork - the fact it doesn't just says that Wizkids are cheapskates.

- The collectible model - yuck. Please wait while I vomit.

Poor components. The cards are some of the worst cards I have ever handled. Not to mention they very often come bent in the booster packs. The ink on many of the dice is coming off or has completely come off. 

The rulebook is the worst rulebook I have ever read. 

The gameplay is OK. I have to frequently look online for particular situations I run into that aren't covered by the rulebook.

I tried it solo to get the rules down, but it turned out to be a great game to play solo. 
So much so that this (and Uncanny X -Men) is at the moment my favorite solo game!
It's cool to try different combinations against each other and since there is no hidden info and the the dice rolls make it highly tactical (as most options are only set after your (re)roll) it's a very cool game for two sided solo.

It's quick to set up, quick to play and has an addictive quality I can't quite explain...

RATING: 8
I got into this game because of Quarriors. I find AvX to really improve on the mechanics from Quarriors. As my first CCG, there was a bit of a learning curve to grasp the depth of the strategy, which really added to enjoyment. At the same time, the mechanics are simple enough for me to play with my 8 year old. The main drawback is that at a tournament level, the game starts to feel repetitive since there are a few cards that greatly outclass others. Hopefully this will be mitigated as future expansions come out.

The collectable nature is what kills it for me in the longrun. I'd like to build a playset with some of the DC releases but beyond that I'm going to stop. It takes Quarriors which I love, makes it a 1 vs 1 duel and turns it more into a game which is something Quarriors lacks a bit. There really is a lot of potential with some cards and combos but there's also a lot of chaff in each set. And in true WizKids fashion cards aren't balanced against each other with some just being heads and shoulders better and therefore they drive the meta game for a particular release. The game is great, but once again everything Wizkids about it sucks.

RATING: 5
Probably one of my most disappointing purchases. The game looked interesting and had great review and I liked reading the cards so bought enough packs to play two players using just my dice to try it out. Unfortunately this game just isn't for me. I disliked how the game punishes you for having your heroes attack the opponent, it seemed totally unthematic and turned the games we played into dull defensive standoffs until someone built up enough to break through without lucky rolls by the opponent to get back in the reserve. 

Obviously the game has its fans who enjoy it a lot more than I do. I'm willing to give this game an average rating because it's not technically a bad game, but I can't give it a good rating because I simply don't enjoy playing it.

RATING: 7
There is probably the hyper competitive game here for people who want it. I don't but i'm now convinced there is some substantial strategy here in how you set up your card/dice pool and in the tactics of what to recruit when and how to utilize your offensive and defensive characters. It still feels fairly light through.
-------------

This gets a bump up. My friend has a big box of dice masters stuff now and it is quite fun. Pick a number between 10-20 and draft that many dice and have a slug fest. Its pretty light with some strategy in drafting a good dice combo and some tactics in choosing when to swing and what to reroll but mostly its just fun throwing fist fulls of custom dice and taunts at each other. I also really like the art for the big box cover even if the cards don't do much for me. I see this as very much a casual game rather than anything competitive.

its alright I guess

As Quarriors was an epic disappointment to pretty much everyone I know, Marvel has succeeded to make it into a playable, enjoyable game with its "Fixed" rule set. It has some issues, but the core rules work very well. The dice are nice and the cards at least somewhat capture the flavor of the heros/villains the represent.

The starter box is awesome, the expansions are aweful as they are in a collectible format, they are at least very cheep for each booster at $1 it is at least a reasonable price point. The expansion cards also have a tendency to be mangled when you open them, a big negative. 

Another problem is the designers seem to be utterly clueless about how to properly balance the cards/dice against each other. Often the cheapest card is the best and the strongest for a hero. This unfortunately just makes the other versions of the hero useless. Rarity at least shows little sign of being a mark of power in a card, though some of the rares are the better cards.

With the expansions being collectible, it greatly increases the cost of collecting a complete set, to about $360, if your lucky. With this you'll end up with Tons of unusable extra dice and cards that have little value. If they sold you the dice and cards at the price of the boosters it would only cost about $45 for the set. And you would be able to play it in a manner similar to most deck building games.

If the expansion was in the LCG format, I would recommend buying this game, as it is, I highly recommend against it.

My all encompassing review of Dicemasters: Really, it's the best two player competitive experience out there right now. Careful thought and understanding probabilities goes a long way towards building a solid "deck," and the winner is usually the one who knows how to manipulate the odds well. It's "random" but it is random in a predictable manner, and still capable of producing those once a year turns that turn a sure loss into a narrow victory. Even if I never purchase another booster, I am confident this game will continue to get played for many years.

This is what got me into board games in January 2015.  Such a simple, yet deeply strategic game series.

I hope the rapid fire output of the new sets don't drag this game down with too many options.

I will still buy all of the releases in 2015 (except YuGiOh)

Nearly complete set. 5 of each die, every common, every uncommon, every rare, and one super rare Black Widow. All cards sleeved.

Love it now, but will it last? WizKids seems like they can't make enough to support it and the supply issues are snuffing out lots of potential interest. I patched together the starter contents from three other people, I never found a starter even after months looking.

*Update: Have not played in over a year. Right now LCG or CCG style games are not for me. This game may well be amazing, but I will never invest the time or money to explore this game in the way it was intended.

I enjoyed Quarriors and this is an improvement. This game did raise my awareness of the lack of production Wizkids has in their games. The most disappointing components are the dice bags, which last 1 or 2 games at best. 

I did not get involved with the game due to the collectable nature- and I have enough of that already.

I love building squads to play. I love learning how abilities interract with other abilities. I love seeing Cyclops destroy a whole team.

Unfortunately Wizkids aren't great at making their rules totally clear, and it has taken some experimentation and external research to know exactly how things work in the game. That being said, I love this game.

Interesting reworking of the [thing=91536]Quarriors![/thing] rules set to make it a 2-player game.

It's fun to play, but the collectible aspect of this game (even though the boosters are cheap) is a bit of a turnoff for me. To make two decks, you almost need two starter sets (so you have the important dice 4 times and also so you have access to all the basic actions twice) and around 20 boosters. Standard rules state that you need 15 dice on 6 hero cards, which means you need to be able to have at least three heroes with three dice each (and three with two).

An OK game with bad development and a rushed flood of expansions.  I've heard that later sets got better, in terms of both quality control and balance, but I was already completely let down by the game well before that happened, so was happy to sell off all of the Dice Masters stuff I'd collected.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

My SO, who is a big fan of deck builders, absolutely despises this game.  I find the order of resolving all the various abilities, counting up attacks and counters and so forth, to be a bit fiddly.  It doesn't have the same "smoothness" of a deck builder that makes them seem to play well with even fairly simple, but elegant mechanics.

The collectible model is also something that really turns me off from a game.  If this could just be a well-balanced box set for the same price as Quarriors, and enough dice to field your teams, I'd probably rate it slightly higher.

For how much hassle it is to get a set of the specific dice you need, I also feel like the dice quality should be higher.  These dice feel extremely cheap.

Admittedly, I don't play by the rules. My wife and I play 25 health, 5 dice at a time, random draw. You stop worrying about optimum teams, counters, and attacks, and you get down to what makes this game one of the best in my opinion: a bunch of my favorite heroes duking it out in the most epic, thrill-of-dice way possible.

Edit: having moved away from 2 player games, and having decided Legendary is better suited to my Marvel tastes, I'm putting this up for trade. I have this base set and a gravity feed, and also uncanny xmen base set and gravity feed for trade.

Me and my wife love this game! It is just so much fun to build and play! Yes, it is collectible and that won't be for everyone, but with just the base set and a few boosters you will have so much diversity already that you can play lots of different games. I love Marvel heroes, I love deck-building and I love dice, this game is just amazing. Construct your own deck of Marvel characters, get your dice rolling and try to beat your opponent. 

Also own:
-Uncanny X-Men: I love the addition of more characters and dice, and the focus on X-Men is a big plus for me.
-Justice League: It is great to be able to mix and match Marvel and DC or face them off against each other.
-Age of Ultron: More Marvel characters in this one, some more that I am not that familiar with, but some more interesting abilities and keywords to try and play with.

I have a love / hate relationship with Dice Masters. It has provided me with something I've always wanted out of Quarriors, a competitive two player game. The collectible aspect is okay since the boosters are so cheap. 

However, rule clarification is a nightmare and this goes for all sets. So many card rules are vague and ambiguous in it's wording. Even worse, it's inconsistent. Almost every game I've played at some point comes to a grinding halt just to find some rules clarification because of how a card is phrased.

Underneath the ruling issues is a very good game. I just wish I could play it consistently without having to rules lawyer every game.

Great superhero/villain head to head battling. Lots of fun and very easy to teach. I don't get too caught up in the collectability, though.

I'm not sure about this game yet. Since I haven't played Quorriors I would compare it to Magic The Gathering and Dominion (with dice instead of cards). I like the dice and I really love the theme. There are some interesting decisions and interactions between cards to take into consideration. On the other hand I play a lot of Magic and Dominion and I'm not sure if Dice Masters offers something better than those games.

Magic the Gathering as a deck building game but using dice instead of cards - game play is very similar in principal to the magic card game with "mana dice" (the currency of this game is Power) to buy more dice and power abilities, "creature dice" (your heroes) attacking and blocking and "spell/instant dice" (actions) to enhance attacks and blocks. The rules are well laid out but as with all games with so many card wordings to break the "normal" rules - there are issues with clarity and certainty that require some FAQs and definitive rulings - but you can play the game out of the box with a little application of common sense.

The cards are good quality (but come very bent out of shape in the booster packs) and the art is good (except maybe that the pictures are repeated on each iteration of a particular hero). The dice are OK quality with some colour issues (that does not effect game play) - they are engraved.

Lots of meta game team building options and probably this is where the bulk of the game actually is. Actual game play is fun if not particularly deep (there is no hidden information) - but hey its rolling dice - all very good.

Note: this is a collectible game but you can play in a group with just the starter and maybe one box of boosters - draft or themed decks - you will not have all the rares and super rares (sheesh!) but those cards are not necessarily the best or most intersting/powerful anyway.

Good game although I doubt its staying power.

Got obsessed with collecting cards and dice but not really worth the effort, especially once Wiz Kids started releasing new versions (and base sets) every quarter.  A bit of a financial and logistical strain.   I haven't noticed much of a market locally for competition or collecting, and my games nights are usually multiplayer so Dice Masters hasn't been played in a very long time. 

The storage options also have been very poor.

That said there is something incredibly exciting about the collectible dice experience, opening the dice packs (especially when I bought a full gravity feed) was a thrill.

This is a really fun game if it is played casually and only if so. There is a aspect to this game that doesn't née to be explored, it's a silly dice game that needs to approached as one if you make it to serious then you have ruined it. Don't ruin it.

I want to be able to play this, but every time we have picked it up, we wind up frustrated and annoyed because we know we are playing it wrong but can't figure out exactly where we are going wrong. It's a game that even watching online tutorials/rules explanations/play-throughs hasn't managed to overcome.

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I thought I was going to enjoy Dice Masters a lot more when I encouraged my mom to get this for Matthew for his birthday in 2014. I have enjoyed the games we've played, but so far bag-building just hasn't grabbed me. Plus the collectible nature of this game and other similarities to Magic mean I'd just rather play Magic.

This is a fun game to play, but I'm biased by one of the few themes I actually care about in games :) It's like Quarriors meets Magic:The Gathering. I bought 15 boosters, though I'm far more interested in the Uncanny X-Men expansion in the fall.

Now I just need people to play with in Portland!

This game is fantastic fun! I might have to bump it up to a 10 soon. I'm not a big fan of having to pump more and more money into it, but it is what it is. So, I won't hold that against it in the ratings. My 8 year old son absolutely loves it. And it has him really interested in everything Marvel right now. So, that is an added bonus. I like how the card abilities really seem to mesh with the character's actual powers. To me the mechanics and feel are a blend of Hearthstone and Dominion/Ascension. How can you go wrong with that? Plus, the dice are super cool. All sorts of fun colors and designs. Love it.

I just bought this in my local not so friendly store, and surprisingly the first feedback I got from on of my gamer friends was that it wasn't a good idea because "it was a cheap game and one shouldn't buy games based on price, one should pick what one is going to play and then just go and buy Starcraft The Boardgame". Personally, I'm not rich so I like the idea of spending just 5 bucks for a few dice that will make the game new and more interesting every now and then. And my collection is very much on the heavy / long / ameritrashy side of games, so I need some fillers besides King of Tokyo.

EDIT: In retrospective, this game isn't cheap at all, but it is very good.

Better than Quarriors (wich isn't very difficult).
It's bling, bling ameritrash.
If you're a super-hero fanboy you'll probably luuuuve the game. If not, than this game will fall pretty flat i surmise.
Selling two cards with two dice for a buck will trigger the collecting disorder of many. But at least for me these days i intuitively steer clear of these business-models (fool me once magic, shame on you.. fool me twice marvel dice masters, shame on me..)

RATING: 5
Overhyped collectable dice game. Played using only 2 base sets, which leaves a lot to be desired. The cheap dice seem to be a lot better than the expensive ones. Most games seem to end up in a stalemate. Both players not attacking (which would leave them vulnerable), waiting for specific combo/ability to be used. This style of game does not fit for a competitive head-to-head game, for me.

And then there is the collectable aspect. Not going to spend an additional ~$100 just to be able to play the complete game, which doesn't seem to make the gaming experince much better.

Would rather play Quarriors (which is about as random but not as competitive) if i wanted to play a dice-building game, .
Would rather play Strife or Pixel tactics for a head-to-head game.

A quick Quarriors meets Magic the Gathering style game.  If you played Quarriors and Magic the Gathering then you know the basics of the Dice Masters.

Pros:
+ $1 booster packs (2 cards, 1 common with 1 other of any rarity and matching dice for both cards)

+ Dice work with any copy/rarity of card

+ Game plays in less than 20 minutes. 

Cons:

- Starter Cards needed to play

- Like ccgs, overpowerd decks overwhelm basic decks.

- Drafting (Dice Grabs) can be too random.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

With one simple rule - the ability to reroll any or all dice once per turn - Dice Masters puts a huge band-aid on the mechanics of Quarriors! to make a playable game.

The downside here is the collectible format that leads to much more convoluted rules that kill the accessibility.

Collectible dice continues to bore me. Quarriors was tedious, some monsters seemed broken, etc. Was disappointed by LotR dice game. Really wanted to like that one - co-op with semi-co-op pasted on? Uhhh, meh.

I think this dice system works best for 2 players. Which is where Marvel gets a chance to shine. But it fell flat for me. The feel reminded me of Magic;tG and thus, the attraction for some people between the collecting, combining characters, and mechanics. Came down to dice rolling which was a bit random. The foundation is there, but it has similar quirks that Magic does which gets on my nerves. May play it again but won't be buying.

I finally got to open my copy of the game. I sleeved the cards and I’m ready to play. Still there are 2 things that bother me. 1. The paper bags are a joke, I know the game is cheap but they are ugly and easy to damage. I don’t think I will use them, however, this is a minor quibble for me. 2. When I open the boosters packs from the gravity feed, many cards came bended (lightly) by the dice, I really hate this. I guess there is no way around it but it bothers me a lot.

I plan to play the game soon, the dice look gorgeous. I hope Dice Masters is considerable better than Quarriors! or I won’t like it.

At last I got to play this fabled game :D. As it is very Quarriors! derivative, I wasn’t expecting much, however I didn’t had much fun in my first game.  It was only the introductory game so there is still hope for Dice Masters to get better. As it stands it is a borderline 6.0 for me. It is, without a doubt, much better than Quarriors!, it still has lots of luck but: 1. The game is only for two players, so the playtime is relatively short. 2. Now you can re roll your dice reducing the luck factor substantially. 3. If your dice get knocked off (or were blocked) you will use them in the next turn. All of that contributes to make the game a lot better. Also I really enjoy the Marvel universe (but the theme is pretty thin). All those dice really look gorgeous.

Other good things for me. Fast to setup and Dice Masters has some interesting decisions beyond Quarriors!, namely how to attack/defend.

Still it is a very simple game but it has the potential to be a fun one. I really hope to play with the tournament rules this month. I still don’t understand how you are supposed to build your deck but I will read those rules this week.

On the bad side, some of my cards are really bended. Random boosters bend the cards in different ways, and I hate that. In the gravity feed pack, some of the cards were damaged in the bottom because they stick together or perhaps the sealing machine caught them. On one of my boosters I got two dice but only one card, the missing card was one of Reed Richards so it had the potential to be the super rare :/.  In general, the game quality is regular.

On a personal level I abandoned MtG a long time ago and now I feel I’m relapsing with Dice Masters. I really hate random distribution boosters, but I can attest it is very effective as I have the urge to buy more to complete the set. I’m not sure about the power level of the rare and super rare cards, but I would think they are very powerful, so if I want to play competitively I would need to get them. This is a hate/love relationship for me. 

I don’t plan to play in tournaments (there are none in my country even if I wanted to) but I read there are some tournament exclusive cards. That’s a very negative point for me as I don’t have any chance to pick them up at a reasonable price.

Bottom line, I’m on the fence about this game. It is still early on so I can perhaps sell the game and leave it behind me, one part of me really wants to do this, however the dominant part tells me that I should play the game again to see if I can enjoy it. I wish this wasn’t a collectible game but I guess it makes much more money for Wizkids. I really dig the LCG format from FFG and if Wizkids used it I surely would buy all the expansions for the game.

After more plays, Dice Masters is now a solid 6.0 for me. I’m enjoying my play of this, but I feel there is something out of synch during combat.

The deckbuilding aspect of the game is very fun, however it is also very time consuming because there are many options. I´m not sure I want to delve deeply into it. Perhaps I will copy some decks from the internet. It can be very expensive to form the deck you want because of the rarity of some cards. Also you need 4 dice per card so this contributes to elevate the cost while making useless all the repeat cards.

I’m upgrading  Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men´s rating. It is, without a doubt,  a fun game. 

On the other hand it seems Wizkids Games is no longer selling Dice Master over the internet. That’s a shame because this is the only way I could get them. In my country almost no store carries them and I don’t plan to participate on tournaments anyway. I guess I should thank them because they saved me a lot of money, it seems I already bought all the Dice Masters I will ever have.

Very quick, very tight game, with an awesome theme.  A surprising degree of strategy and timing.  No bluffing here so all about resource management and risk taking.  Sort of like a boxing match.  Components are just a joy to behold.  Seriously - just great looking dice.  And the number one most important factor - damn is this game a lot of fun.

First the game was impossible to find, now there are so many expansions that it's impossible to keep track of them. To me it's Quarriors 2.0 with more rules to keep track of. It's fun as a beer and pretzels game, and it's awesome to buy a booster pack for a dollar, but I have all I ever need of it.

I hate the collectability because I'm a completionist at heart.  The rushed early sets had balance issues, quality issues on the dice, and people chasing Super Rares, but the game is solid.  It's too bad WizKids turned me and my group off by pumping out so many sets in such a short time.  It's also too bad they kept the superhero theme in the collectible model versus TMNT which is the LCG model.

Just overall not very fun game. Mechanics aren't great, all the global abilities get too complicated, particularly related to timings of certain actions, also ends up being costly due to CCG element with new sets being released what seems like monthly.

The kids love it so I love it with them.  Of course I adore the Marvel characters but have gone down the collectability route enough times in the past that I won't play THAT game.  

That being said, 2x common sets from eBay at the low, low price of $3 each, I'm ready to play this game more seriously.  And by seriously, I mean extremely casually with my family.  For enjoyment!

If I didn't already have Quarriors I would have definitely given this a go.  But my experience with dice building hasn't been the greatest.  Although this does look a better game, out of the box it doesn't inspire much.  With its collectible nature and the amount to collect a lot of money could easily be lost on this game.

Will be keeping an eye on it though.

7/6/2014 - So much better than Quarriors (which I still think is quite good). The theme is part of what makes it, but also the combat, which is maybe a little overly complex, but also more interesting for that.

7/12/2015 - Unlike Quarriors, this one only plays with 2, which means it just doesn't see the table for me. I play plenty of 2 player games, but my wife and I prefer the puzzley games over the conflict games.

2017-11-06 - Yeah, I liked my early plays of this, but it's not the kind of game my wife and I are likely to play very often. I might keep it around to see if my little enjoys it, but it's probably going to sit on the shelf.

Roll dice to gain the energy to buy the bigger dice applying to heroes – with the end goal of getting past the opponent's dice enough to power them down to zero. Not a bad game BUT it's a CDG (collectible dice game) and there's a real danger of one day the whole market bottoming out.

PLUS: theme is present
BIG MINUS: collectible game with two very powerful super rares can imbalance the game

It's ok - I think it would be better with the booster packs. The base game gets old quickly.

Original:
Makes me feel like when I first started to playing Magic The Gathering. Everything seems so nice. I think it is MTG but more random (equally, to both players) and easier to learn, thus more unpretentious, at least for now - and for my taste.

Currently I will probably always choose to play Dice Masters over MTG, the only exception would be in a sanctioned tournament, because I still like very much playing MTG competitively. But the fun factor of Dice Masters make it for the casual playing.

Update:
We are playing 15 life/dice and 6 character games. The game is taking a little too long for my taste: 60 minutes. In 50 minutes I can play a complete best of 3 in MtG.

Update:
The "new game hype" passed. I would like to play it more, but it seems it won't hit the table so often.

RATING: 3
I could never handle the mechanics of this game that favour passive and defensive strategies. Your hard earned high-costed characters could be stopped by a single sidekick, thus making combat - in a superhero world - irrelevant.

Oh!, and the collectible aspect of the game trashes the balance even in casual games. You just can´t use any character in your team because there are versions deliberately worse than others.

A good thing is that you only need one card as you can use any dice of any version of the same character. But this doesn´t make a better game, just saves you some money that shouldn't be spent in this to begin with.

RATING: 6
The theme is cool and so is the concept of a Quarriors-style dice building game. What I don't enjoy as much is the fact that it the game tends to end with both players just building up for one big all-or-nothing attack to take the other player down. Or maybe we're just not good at the game.

I played a demo copy of this and was very excited about the release. The game plays very well (I was a fan of Quarriors) and the price point seems extremely reasonable.  Picked this up last night at the midnight release, really happy with the component quality, the condition of the cards I am not happy with packing dice and cards together just mangles the cards.

If you're worried about collect-ability aspect of this game, don't be, from what I've seen some of the commons are better than the rares, the cards get dinged up from the dice before you open the packs so they won't have a lot of resale value, and the starter set ($15) gives you enough options to at least be competitive and win some games.

RATING: 10
This feels like a game that was made for me. The evolution of turning Quarriors into a head to head dice game with Magic the Gathering Combat makes a very rich duelling game. The collectability is present here but handled extremely well and uses characters from fun intellectual properties.

The most random game ever: random booster pack purchases + random die draw + random die roll = absolutely no control.

The die quality is disappointing, the theme is [b][i]absolutely[/i][/b] not present (both players can have the same characters; "global" effects on character cards can be used by both players). Rules and game design seem unfinished. The dice bags are a bad joke. The hype around this game makes no sense to me at all and solely relies on blind fanboy passion.

The only good thing about this game is the low price for booster packs, which then again kind of gives me the impression that this game's main targeted audience are younger players.

Don't get me wrong: I would really love to like this game, as I like dice, deck-building and superheroes, but the parts of this ambitious mix just don't connect and work with each other.

Playing this game does not evoke any superhero atmosphere at all, but rather feels like I already lost against some supervillain and he/she is torturing me.

A fast paced card battle game, that pits two masterminds (you and an opponent) against each other.  You do this through the use of hero cards and action cards in a deckbuilding manner that you must acquire predetermined dice (heroes/actions)during your game play.  These dice help you roll fast and furious to see whether or not you are able to knock out your opponent before they do you.  Begin; 20 Life, grab your heroes to fight with, and the clock starts ticking! This is my favorite deck builder, dice rolling, beat'em up game.  So, if Quarriors and Magic had a baby it would be Marvel Dice Masters!

I do want more characters, but with the starter and a few boosters I do see the theme of the actions and characters coming through and I enjoy the head to head conflict that this type of game presents. It needs pimping (cool dice bags, cool box and cool life counters) but will become a big thing for me I think.

Update: I am really enjoying this so far, I like building the squads (it is so simple with this game) and seeing how they fare against other squads. A lot of fun.

Great game that is hampered by its collectible nature and requirement to keep up with the relentless release schedule. Those factors made me give up on it.

PROS
- Great licensing here allowing you to play DC vs Marvel vs TMNT vs etc.
- overall the dice are very cool.
- quick playing with a small footprint.
- really good fan-made solo variant.
- "Dice building" mechanic twist on "deck building"
- There is some depth to the game if you get serious about it by collecting the "good" cards and/or looking for good combinations.
- Two good, serious players going head to head can be quite the cerebral battle as both attempt to setup combos and defensive counters.

CONS
- collectible nature of the game with tiered cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc) means that it's not a level playing field like a LCG. Some people have cards others didn't get access too or weren't willing to buy in the secondary market.
- Wizkids quality control.
- Wizkids release schedule.
- The game doesn't promote characters as much as just random individual cards... so if you want to play Superman and Spiderman just for fun, their cards could potentially be terrible whereas Cheetah or Aunt May could be amazing cards.
- It's hard to play the game casually because then you miss the depth of the serious game. It can just become a random grind or very unbalanced because of the cards drafted or chosen for fun.
- Related to the above, there isn't any support for the casual player with for example recommended starting teams.
- Overall, not worth the price of keeping up with the game, hunting down cards, list building vs the overall gameplay experience.

This would normally be the kind of game we'd hate because it's straight attacking and there's the luck of the dice. But we LOVE the Marvel universe, and you don't actually lose your characters when they're knocked out, so we found this game is so much fun!

Es un juego muy divertido, aunque no estoy seguro de que sea tan estratégico. LA cantidad de dados hace que sea muy atractivo visualmente y la construcción de equipos te hace pensar un poco al momento de escoger tus personajes.

Great Marvel themed game.  But since it's a CCG, be careful of falling into the trap of buying many boosters.  If you don't want to get into the "competitive" scene then just the starter set will work for you.  I buy boosters simply because there are certain characters I like that are not in the starter set.

RATING: 2
This was a huge disappointment to me.  I love Quarriors and I collected comics for decades.  I also love dice in general (not in a creepy way mind you).  Its the collectible part that broke it for me.  
1)I would rather pay 100$ (I don't really want to pay that much mind you) to have the game rather than to spend 100$ to maybe have the game.  
2)I would also prefer a game that was self contained and didn't require that someone else own the game as well.  I left the CCG world behind me when I entered board games.  I loved that I could just bring a game and anyone could play
3)I don't like the possibility that Wolverine can fight Wolverine etc.  hero fighting hero is just another day in comic book land.  But it takes a special break for a hero to fight themselves. (I mean remember Stryfe and Cable, yeesh what a headache)


Perhaps the 2 is overly harsh.  Could have been the paper dice bags pushed me over the edge.  The bottom line is that its a "CCG" while Quarriors is a drafting game.  I prefer the drafting

I've played it a few times and really enjoyed it; I look forward to playing it more, especially since I now feel like I have an understanding of all the rules, big and small.

About 50% of the dice already have paint chipping away on a side or two--which is annoying, but not a huge issue--and the warping of cards found in every booster pack is a bit frustrating.

Don't really see much of a difference between this and the UXM set so copying my comment: CCG style game but dice-driven. The combinations of characters (and there are loads of them) allow tons of customization and different combos to explore. The theme is strong in what each character can do although not so much in the mechanics of the game itself. You really need to think defensively in this as a strong attack against your opponent can leave your defenses empty, if you're not careful, and susceptible to a route. The rules take a bit to get your head around but the game is pretty well-supported with FAQs, etc.

It started out fun but turned really sour for me after the fourth or fifth play. 
The game can be really unbalanced, even with most of the "expansions". Even if you think you now how to assemble a team, any strategies are largely based on luck and less on skill. That may be a pro for some gamers, but not for me. 

Also, with the release of a ton of extra Marvel and DC Packs, the theme gets muddled and you realize how thinly the theme is pasted on.

I don't know if I like it or not.
I love the Marvel theme and the dice rolling. The problem is the game mechanics. They're good but some rounds feels like both players are stockpiling their dice in order to defeat the other player in one last turn. So it's an arms race to the finish instead of knocking a few dice here and there. This doesn't happen always but sometimes it seems like the best strategy and it gets really boring.

Other than that the game can be really fun and I really like the small custom dice.

What I wanted Legendary to be.  Very, very fun and highly replayable.

Of course, the CCG aspect guarantees you won't have a full game without spending more than 200 bucks, but I just got the dice and proxied the character cards to play at home.

Update 1:  It can be much less thematic than Legendary, as some abilities make a lot of sense and others make absolutely none.  It also sucks that certain characters exist solely to boost others with no identity of their own, such as Aquaman (JLA booster) and War Machine (Iron Man booster), so they are way less useful if you don't pair them with the associated characters.  It is fun, but the collectible aspect of it and the quick production of sets made it overwhelming to store and play in no time flat.

RATING: 6
This is an ok game overall, but I don't think it was worth the hype on several levels:
1. Component quality is really lacking.  I get that the booster packs are relatively cheap, but the quality of the dice is really not great, and the cards in the boosters are typically bent and warped.  
2. For as many people who comment about how easy this game is and how the rules are straightforward, there is a ton of discussion and confusion on the semantics of the cards, requires significant effort for FAQs and errata.  
3. The initial cards available just don't seem to give a lot of variety.  Most cards have really high costs, leaving a limited number of cards to choose from.  When searching for examples of teams people have constructed, there definitely are a handful of cards used in almost every team.  I realize this will change as more expansions come out, but it was a disappointment all the same.
4. I'm just not really into CCG type games.  Hunting for boosters in the hope of gaining all the cards/dice in order to compete with people who do want to spend considerable time and money acquiring every super rare card and building killer teams, is just not my preference of game.

I enjoyed the game play, but I am not sure I want to get into the collectible nature of this game. Even though I love superheroes I am looking forward to the D&D version of the game.

RATING: 5.5
A just-competent-enough game with a glut of niggling little issues. 

1) Marvel theme completely pointless other than to move units. The abilities have no relation to the cards whatsoever. 

2) This is Quarriors, folks. There are of course some rules distinctions, but it's the same stuff in a shiny new package(s).

3) Individual pools that you draft from was done better in Nightfall (even though Nightfall isn't very good) because you draft from the same deck and because there weren't abilities that all players could use printed on the cards.

4) CCG distribution model. Yup, it's here in full force and it's just as odious as it's ever been. 

I can't tell if this game is trying to make itself out to be a competitive game (which it has no chance of being) or just a collectible. Either way, it's not much of a game. Average across the board.

RATING: 8
You roll 4 dice from your bag per turn. You get some basic starting dice that's mostly mana, and an array of cards along with 20 assorted dice matching those cards in front of you to buy with said mana. Mana comes in a few types, but one die result matching the card you want is enough to allow you to spend however many dice it takes to buy it. The cards each have an ability that you get when you use their dice. The character dice have half their sides as double mana, and half are creatures representing them with a cost (in spending dice) an attack and a def hen it's like magic where you attack and defend but your creatures are dice, and once they combat they return to the discard where they re-roll when you run out of dice in your baggie.

I really wish this game wasn't collectible. I really had a great time playing it. I love how they actually got the rights to use the art from the comics.

A Collectible dice-building game. It reminds me a little of Magic: The Gathering in that you use energies to bring your superhero (creature) out and fight for you. I like the design of some of the superheroes that really reminds you of their abilities in the comic. There are a lot of combinations you can build your team, so re-playability is very high.

The game is good, but I dropped it since I don't like the blind collective side of the game and how Wizkids is dealing with it. If it was being sold in a "living card game" style I probably would buy every expansion. But if I would want to gamble with my money I'd be in a casino. (And that's why I don't play magic or yugioh anymore too).

I bought a starter and some boosters, and ended up buying more until I stopped at 90 boosters (there is a sort of logic to that).  It was enough to get a full set of dice (except for the starter heroes - they are rarer than the other dice), a full set of common cards, *one* card short of a full set of uncommons and a handful of rares.  I can't imagine wanting or needing to buy more unless I was daft enough to chase a complete set.

May 2014:  Tried it once with Allen.  Need to play it more to see if I like it better than Quarriors.  Must people do, but I'm not a Magic player so the combat system in Quarriors seemed fine and the fact that Dice Masters has more of a Magic combat system does nothing for me.

I think it´s a bit "cold"; I mean: I like the cards, I like the price, like the theme, it´s a quick dice game... But I don´t like the size of the dices (very small). Don´t like the blue and red airplane barf bags. I´m not very happy with its mechanics. It´s a pity because I think it could be a better game than it is.

13-07-2014. Rated after 3 plays. MdM takes quarriors to the next level but also puts a CCGish aspect to it. Basically you try to attack your opponent with dice of different statistics and special abilities. The dice give resources or can be used to fight/defend with. 

While I think this game is a lot better than quarriors, I do not like it enough to go all-in on this one, given that if you want to play it,  you need to buy a lot of boosters to be competitive or if you want it all.

RATING: 9
A dice building game that feels like a blend between Magic: The Gathering and Ascension.  Really fun, lots of team choices, and boosters are only $0.99.  Even when you get a duplicate of a card it's still good because you get extra dice for that character to use in the game.  Lots of play style choices and there are tournaments if you like that sort of thing.  Easy to learn, cool playmat to download and print.

Dice Masters is addictive. Very addictive. So be warned.
It's smart to think about what you want this game to be. Will you just play it casually with friends? Compete in (local) tournaments? Entertain your kids with some fast superhero action? 
The game's certainly able to play each of those roles well, but depending on your preferences it can become very expensive, very fast...

Since it's a collectable game, with different rarities, completionists may spend quite some money chasing every card in each set. The more casual players don't need to worry, though, as the abilities on many of the common and uncommon cards are as good (some even better) as many of the rares and super-rares.

The good thing about Dice Masters, is that is has a relatively small footprint. You can easily fit your team (dice and cards) in a dice bag and carry that around. Playtime is short, the game can be played in about half an hour and explained in about ten minutes. This means it can be played anywhere and anytime. Which is a big plus for a game, in my book.

You and your opponent will be building towards an attack that outsmarts the other side's defense, in order to deal damage to the other player and get to victory. Most of the time, this struggle for supremacy is an exciting battle of wits (with the occasional gamble). And though some team builds are able to beat others before the opponent even knows what's going on, you can easily remedy this when not playing competitively. Switch sides after a game, for example. Or play best-out-of-five.

Another fun aspect is the team building. I often find myself on the couch or at the table, cards spread out, pondering on a new build. There's so many ways to approach this aspect of the game: you can follow the competitive meta, trying how well you do with current 'top lists'; you can build thematic teams (Magneto leading the Brotherhood of Mutants, Professor X at the head of an X-Men team,...); take a Character you love and build a team supporting its ability;... So even when you're not playing, this game can still entertain you.

Dice Masters is one of those games that fits firmly in the easy to learn, hard to master-category. The basic framework of the rules is very straightforward, but the many different abilities and the synergies you can create while building your teams provide players with ample opportunity for experimentation.

I own 1 Starter and 66 booster packs, all stored in the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCAbm7cKyfY]Uncanny X-Men Collector's Box[/url].

Price gougers and Wizkids' unreliability could very well kill this game for me. The game itself is fun and the satisfaction from cracking a pack is well worth the $1. Awesome dice that are very representative of their respective characters, though where is the Invisible Woman?? The other Fantastic Four are present, but I'd take her over The Thing any day of the week!

Boring game in a flashy package. There are very few interesting choices, and the double randomness of Quarriors carries over to this game. There are so many great customisable games out there, I can't imagine why anyone would choose this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Some of the component quality is suspect (better in UXM). Some of the cards are broken. The card art is a bit lazy (I REALLY want different art for each version of a character.) Some of the character titles are uninspired (to put it nicely). Oh...and it's a collectible game. With all of these faults, I'm not sure how I give this an 8.5, but all I can say is that this game is fun! I love the OP that WizKids supports and the different draft formats. The packs are priced perfectly for impulse buys, and I absolutely have no feeling that I NEED to own it all. In fact, I've done very well in OP without any of the super rares and with a relatively minimal set of cards. (I don't even own most of the rares.) If you haven't tried this one, buy the starter and sets of duplicate cards/dice from someone who wants to get rid of them dirt cheap because they bought 4 gravity feeds (yeah, there's lots of those people for some reason) and jump in!

EDIT: (2017) This game declined for me over time. I like it, but it's not nearly the game (in either design or quality) that Star Wars: Destiny is. (Granted...comparing the two is a bit forced because they're very different games.) I have sold almost all of my Dice Masters stuff at this point besides some of the D&D sets, but I never play anymore.

One of my favourite and quick games to play.
Helps that i love the theme and always brings back my childhood love of superheroes in a game that I can play with my kids.
The base mechanics are relatively straightforward so my kids are able to get into the game relatively quickly and the depth and breadth of characters aids so much flavour to the game. The dice are amazing and the number of combinations makes every game so unique.
I play this mainly to scratch my enjoyment itch and don't get to caught up in finding the best combos and patterns and just love having enjoyable mixes of groups doing battle (like Spiderman teaming with Wolverine and Loki and the Joker). 
It also scratches my collecting itch. 
Some of the dice can be a little hard to read but all up Love it!

Takes the Quarriors rules and with some small tweaks greatly improves upon the original. The inexpensive starter and .99 blind packs make overlooking the collectibility aspect possible. Grab a starter set and $10-$15 of dice packs and have a blast.

Very very fun game, pick up the starter if you can find it (but do try and get it at MSRP, not at $30+ - it's not quite worth that much). Don't let the collectible aspect turn you off from this - though you'll hear people complain about the power level of the super rares, some of the best cards in the set are found in the starter and some of my favorite cards are at the common rarity. There are some odd balance issues, where only a handful of cards are worthwhile to play, and a lot are costed too high to be efficiently played often - I'm hoping that this is ironed out in later sets.

Not a bad Quarriors-style game.

You bring 8 x Character/Equipment cards and corresponding dice (up to 20) along with two action cards and start with 20 life.

Draw and roll 4 dice per turn and use rolled icons (resources) to buy more dice (ala a deckbuilder).

Field characters. Attack/block ala MtG. Knock opponent to zero life to win.

The current meta game favours some of the Ultrarares (Tsarina and Gobby) and if you don't cope with these, the game will be over in 15 minutes. Yawn.

Looking forward to more sets to allow for a wider scope of play.

Overrated, but still decent.  We don't play with the Globals (yet, maybe someday), we draft from three sets of four to form our teams at the beginning, and we also draft 2 basic action dice each at the beginning to start with 10 dice in our bags.  We then draw out 5 dice each round.  That tempers the power of the low-cost characters and increases the likelihood that some of the 5, 6, and 7 cost characters will actually see the table.

Two player collectable dice building game.  Gameplay is relatively quick and sufficiently strategic, and I've always been enamored with the Marvel universe.  I think part of the reason I'm so terrible at this game is because I think of it as "MtG with dice" instead of a deck builder with dice.  

I've put together a two-player duel set, so there's (thankfully) no need to purchase more packs.

Uh-oh, I feel the itch.  I honestly did not expect to like this game.  I thought it would feel exactly like Quarriors and most of the time I'm right on with those feelings.  I've had people tell me things like Forbidden Island and Desert or Castle and Zombie Panic are very different games only to find out that they are essentially the same exact game with very minor differences.  I thought this would simply be a 2-player Quarriors with a super-hero skin.

I was wrong and I want to collect the whole set.  Correction, I will collect the whole set.  Now, I should point out that I didn't HATE Quarriors.  I wanted to like it and even bought 2 expansions for it before cutting ties.  It was always a game that was just missing that something to make me like it and I think this game has that.  Something about getting rid of the Dominion-style central card pool and having players duel with their own combination of available dice fixes it.  In Quarriors the first player to luck into the most Quiddity in a turn and buy the biggest monster won.  In this game it is very viable to try very different strategies and the 7-cost dice aren't always the best for your dice pool.  Especially considering in this game there is no limit to the number of buys in a turn.

So, you construct a pool of 20 dice and the game play is very similar to Quarriors from there.  You roll a certain number a turn, these give you "energy", you buy more dice with that and eventually they will recycle into your available dice pool.  The cost and stats on the dice work the same way as in Quarriors and attacking is essentially the same except you choose to either attack immediately or keep a die out to be available to block.

The collectible model puts some people off but at a cool buck a pop, it's not too terribly expensive to get into compared to others.  One thing I will say in contrast to most people is there is this idea going around that you don't NEED the super-rares to compete.  The super-rares aren't just "cooler" though, they are outright better.  2 of the 4 super-rares are some of the most used dice in the game which you can find out just reading through the forums here.  A less expensive deck will probably lose to a well constructed one containing these cards.  I don't think I would say they are game breaking, but to actually compete you would actually need to stumble into, trade, or buy them.  And the secondary market for these things is already ridiculous.  Considering the small set size and cost of the boosters I find it unbelievable that people are paying 40+ dollars compared to things like Magic where cards need to be really good to hit that price point on release and those sets have 3-400 card sets and cost 3-4 bucks per booster.

Also, it's been over a month since I played and I still can't find this anywhere which is really upsetting, even more so because this initial popularity is keeping the secondary market outrageous.

Same Quarriors engine, but different car around it. Customization and replay value with just the first released set of characters is already off the charts and will only get better. Can play quick games with 6-character teams, or longer ones with a full 8-character tournament-style compliment. It is collectible, so will have to sink lots of money in it if you're a completionist or a serious official play gamer.  What I do like is that many commons are just as good or better than rares and super rares. Boosters are only $1 each, which includes 2 characters/dice, so $50 will get you tons of fun and up to $100 will set you up pretty well to challenge most - until they release the next set, of course...ack!

I really like the dice aspect of the game, I have never owned a "collectible" game before, but I can see the draw. I am hoping to do my best to resist the urge to get more and possibly hold out for the DC version. Having the maximum dice per hero card would be cool though.
Some of the dice that came in the two player starter box were different finish textures (side kick dice) and a slight colour variations in the red, blue, yellow and red (more like not enough colour) I did hear that they Dice masters had issues with the production of the dice and it doesn't really effect the game. Custom dice bags are a must if you have normal sized hands.

I like this and if I can get a 4 player game going it will be great. I havent seen the rules yet...

The game does have a strategy that is slowly emerging - we play solely for theme so no real deck building and as long as you have a low cost character or two to get you started its fine.

I was disappointed when I disovered it was a CCG though. I actually thought that the core set was enough. The game is a 60 pounds purchase. Not 10. Especially when you must get certain characters.
Top tip - I got the basic cards with dice from ebay. This gives me enough dice. Then I just print proxies to play with if I want to use one of the more expensive cards. Fine for playing in the house.

This is a collectible dice/card game.  You collect dice and cards, build a team of heroes and/or villains and battle your opponent.  Each card represents a character in the Marvel universe.  You select also a number of dice to include with each character card.

You start with 8 generic sidekick dice.  You draw dice out of a bag and roll them.  Dice faces include energy for use to play abilities and purchase dice or character faces that you can field.  When you field a character face on a die, you can attack or defend with them.

You also purchase the dice for each hero/villain character in your team.  When you purchase them, you will eventually draw and roll them.  Hero/villain characters are stronger than your initial sidekick characters, so you want to purchase them and draw them.

This is a collectable game.  A starter will give you enough dice and cards to play.  You can buy packs that include 2 cards and 2 dice to add more dice and cards to allow you to build better teams.

I'm just really hooked on this game like I did with Magic:  The Gathering.  The collectable and deck (team) building aspect of the game really appeals to me.  The dice drawing mechanic resembles the card game mechanics of the draw deck and discard pile.  There are also action cards and dice in addition to the characters that add to what can happen in a game.

It's oddly contradictory how a game can be almost entirely random and yet quite satisfying. I enjoyed playing it and was happy to play again, but it's essentially bullshit as a strategic game.

It's also bullshit as a game with blind boosters and rare cards. If you're buying heavily in to this, be prepared to have 40 of something that you don't want and can't trade.

Update: Absolutely the best way to collect this game is to ignore Rare and Super Rare cards, buy a handful of boosters and the complete your sets online. 

I've also played quite a lot now and being able to put together a few sets to take and play against someone else who has done similar is quite entertaining, but it really has to be played in a light-hearted spirit.

Rating up from 6 to 7.5

Further update: The lack of clarity of rules and a seeming complete lack of an FAQ to mitigate the awful WizKids quality control killed off my interest in this game. Once it slips to an occasional game, you spend half your time debating how to interpret the rules on cards. Sold.

I have mixed feelings about the collectible aspect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of strategy in this game.  I was expecting a Quarriors level of decision making, but it's a lot more similar to Magic the Gathering.  I plan to get one or two gravity feeds so I can get all of the commons and uncommons.  I'm glad the rares aren't really any more powerful than commons and uncommons.  That way I can stop before spending $100.

Update: I bought one gravity feed and didn't get any super rares and I even missed out on a lot of the better uncommons and rares, which really left a sour taste in my mouth.  I loved opening all the packs and playing with limited card/dice pools as we kind of did a draft.  But once all the packs were opened and we played a few times, it became apparent that certain dice are much stronger and they were included in every game (Beast 666 and Tsarina are the worst offenders).  The excitement and variety quickly faded.  It certainly didn't help that I only know one other person to play with.  When the next set was announced I had no interest in spending more money, so I sold my set while demand was still high.

Game mechanics of this "dice deck-building game" are fairly simple, but the choices players face throughout are not. Marvel Dice Masters feels an awful lot like Magic: The Gathering, but the collectible aspect is less onerous. A few of the dice have issues with the ink, and a few are designed with colors that are difficult to see, but component quality generally is good. I suspect this will have some staying power ... and will be a hit with my nephews.

My low rating is based on Wizkids poor handling of the game and not the system itself. The gaming system and it's components have marvelous potential, but Wizkids really rushed this to market and only seem to care about money and not a fine tuned product or the community. Between broken cards, ill worded cards, printing errors that are not likely a result of the factory but of the proofs used to set the printings and a general "we don't give a fuck about clearing up any of our fuck-ups" attitude towards the gaming community this one is dead in the water for me. If they took the time to fine tune the rule set and get cards released with wording that did not require a plethora of rules lawyering that they seem not to want to involve themselves in I could easily up my rating to an 8 or 9 but sadly I do not see this happening.

Uhhh, this is fun. You get to control (individual) Marvel characters. Quick and easy and tons of replay-ability.

However, this game is a collectible card/dice game and you need to buy (lots) of booster packs to get the full experience. This is an absolute no go for me! If you want to create collectibles, get stickers with chewing-gum. Don't ruin games with buy-to-win mechanisms...

Bottom line - I have this nagging feeling of owning an incomplete game :(

Finally got a play in of this game.  Initial impression is that it is very fast.  Unlike Quariors or other deck builders, this game is more similar to Magic the Gathering and can definitely result in fast KO, so strategic blocking is imperative.  Out of my 8 characters available, I think I only bought 3-4 either game, same is true of my opponent.

Had a hard time grasping the idea that characters are deployed and out once they've been activated, again more like Magic than Quarriors.

There is massive depth here; the "global" effects seem like they will be really tough on new players, as any given board can have 2-6+ of these effects to keep track of, along with your own abilities.  This is NOT a light game, and I'd weigh it just below Magic in terms of potential interactions and ways to mentally juggle possibilities.

I like it, just not what I expected after playing Quarriors, which is the closest thing I can think of mechanically.  If you like deeper games, grab this, if you want something light, you probably will not dig it.

I'll compare this game to WizKids other dice game Lord of the Rings.  For $50 I got 97 dice, 4 real dice bags, player mats, cards, and a great box to hold it all.  Unfortunately this game is broken and I'm glad I only paid $10 for it on Black Friday.  With Dice Masters I've spent $80 and only have to show for it is somewhere just over of 100 dice and cards a bunch of which are all duplicates.  I then had to go and buy a plastic divided case to hold the dice and a deck box for the cards.  The only thing that makes this palatable is that it is a great game and a lot of fun to play. Lastly the dice quality of Marvel is awful when compared to that of Lord of the Rings.  I do not have a single Marvel dice that doesn't have a flaw where as with The Lord of the Rings I only have one flawed die.

Then the previews, from Tom Vasel and Rodney Smith, started rolling in. And the lack of a Marvel game in my collection hit me.

I ended up with an early starter from my FLGS, and I was hooked!

There is a good game here. WizKids has terrible templating and balancing, but Eric Lang really kicked this into a top notch product from the basic Quarriors design.

The collectible model is a necessary evil unfortunately. Luckily, I have no interest in much past Marvel!

Uncanny X-Men has added a great deal to the game.

I acquired Uncanny X-Men first (as a starter bundle) and have received some AvX cards in a trade.  I'm assuming they can be mixed in and used as-is.  If that's NOT the case I think the differences between the two games are probably very minimal anyways so my rating is the same for both games.  This game brings a happy smiling feeling when it's brought to the table because it's easy as well as deep.

UPDATE January 2015: Happy to trade dice, but Marvel Dice is staying. I bought some Uncanny X-Men stuff. It reminds me of Magic the Gathering with superheroes and dice.

UPDATE: Entire collection for trade, including the contents of about 80 boosters, two starter packs (including one in its original packaging), and some individual dice trades. I have full sets of all the commons, most - if not all - of the uncommons, and a fair few of the rares. Contact me about individual dice.

UPDATE: Back on the trade/sale list. It's a 'meh' take on Quarriors with an unnecessary collectible aspect and unnecessary deckbuilding, which seems to have achieved a cult following due to the rarity of the dice and the superhero theme.

I prefer Quarriors, which works much better as a casual dice bash. If I want head-to-head two-player competition, we have countless better games.

£90 every few months for a gravity feed is too much money for a game of this poor quality.

***

UPDATE: We found the 're-roll' rules. This, and drafting, improved the game. Rating upped to eight. It's a different game from Quarriors, but uses the same system. The starter set is a bit of an immature system - needs waiting until the boosters are on widespread release.

***

Game put up for sale after two plays. I loathe superheroes, which may explain why I'm clear-headed about its virtues as a game system.

It's Magic the Gathering crossed with Quarriors, and the offspring isn't an improvement on its parents. Quarriors is random silly fun - on par with King of Tokyo. Magic the Gathering isn't improved by random silliness.  

To explain my objection in more detail. Magic the Gathering, a serious strategy game, has an unpleasant luck element. You draw land cards, which provide 'mana' to buy monsters/spells. If your lands don't come up, you can lose the game through no fault of your own - a phenomenon called 'mana screw'. Most successors of Magic removed the 'land draw' system to reduce this undesirable randomness.

Marvel Dice Masters DOUBLES the randomness of Magic. First, you draw dice from your bag. Second, you roll them. Some dice faces show 'mana' and others show monsters. If you're unlucky, you draw the wrong dice ('mana screw v.1') and then you roll all land ('mana screw v.2'). 

In a game where people are expected to trade for dice, deckbuild before a match, and play tournaments, this level of random is unacceptable.

The level of strategy is too much for a random dice-chucking game. If you want to spend ten minutes throwing dice, summoning monsters and yelling, you don't want to mess around constructing a deck, trading for dice, opening boosters, etc.

This is pretty much the game everyone wanted Quarriors to be. It is still based more or less on the same system, but with players building their own pool of recruitable dice instead of sharing a tableau, adding a TCG angle to the mix. The game plays smoothly and intuitively, much like its parent game, although the focused head to head combat here feels more swingy than the around the table non-targeted combat in Quarriors.

There are a few strange design decisions as well. Some cards have paid global effects, which either player can trigger. It's a little clumsy, since it can be tough to track and utilize effects on an opponents cards, since they are printed rather small and situated across the table. Also, there is absolutely no faction limitations for team building, even between villains and heroes. This becomes quickly degenerate, as there are power cards that inevitably show up in every build.

That all being said, it's fun and it's cheap, descriptors rarely used in the same entry these days...so it's something to check out, as long as you don't take it too seriously.

Great core set. Wish we just stopped here, as it really had everything we needed for casual play. Now we have a huge collection of cards and dice from all the other Marvel and DC sets too. 

This gets to the table a lot, but it takes longer to set up as it does to play (again a problem of too many cards and dice to sort through with all the boosters we have).

I love Dice Masters. The production quality is high. The collectability is fun, though not required. Even spending $40 on this game would provide tons of replayability. Creating teams is a fun challenge. I do not play real competitively, but it is a fun casual game, with lots of variations possible in how to develop teams. The superhero and D&D themed sets are my favorites.

I pre-ordered this a while back, but because WizKids did a terrible job at predicting how much demand there would be for this game I only just received it. I purchased this as a gift for my 6 year old nephew and it was quite a hit after adjusting some of the rules to make it easier for him to grasp (ignore the card text, energy is all the same, pick up to four characters, same number of dice, roughly balanced characters, and one action card that is grossly simplified). Given how I've played the game is probably a 6/10, but I'm bumping the rating one because with the card text it would definitely be better. I'd be happy to play the game, but I'll probably hold off until the D&D Dice Masters comes out since that's a theme that's closer to my heart.

RATING: 6
Wow, this game is a lot more like Magic: The Gathering than I expected. The designer(s) clearly started with Quarriors and Magic and spliced them together - pretty seamlessly, I might add - so the result is naturally workable and entertaining.

If there are any valid criticisms, I think they're the following:

The game wants to be shorter than it is.  I could play a real game of Magic in the same amount of time - sometimes multiple games - so I'm not sure that Marvel Dice Masters is a good substitute.

Someone within 48-72 hours will hit upon the single best combination of heroes - easy to do, since there are so few card combinations compared to MTG - and then tourney players (and some casuals) will be netdecking like crazy. But if you play with friends who avoid that sort of soul-spoiling fun it won't matter.

The game can degenerate into a downward spiral for the losing player once the scales are tipped.  In my last game, for example, I became locked into a cycle of spending all my energy to put up defending units, so I was never able to improve my dice pool by purchasing more (and better) units. It was a hole that I couldn't climb out of, and it was pretty frustrating.

The game (currently) only supports two players.  I can do lots of things with my 2-player game time, including short awesome wargames like Fading Glory and Quebec 1759, so Marvel Dice Masters wouldn't hit the table often anyway.  My kids avoid 2-player games at all costs, unfortunately, so this is a definite no-buy for me.

All in all, if you've got time, money, and opponents to burn, Dice Masters could be a worthwhile investment.

It's a cool game, but I´m not much on the super hero theme. I bought it because I knew this was a great game system, but I wouldn't have until they released the D&D version had I known about it at the time. Still, I play this game with virtually "any" hero regardless of name or skill, and it's still a blast. Like I said, thematics don't work on me at all, but the gameplay is fantastic enough to keep me into the game. One bad thing though is the fact you can get stuck if your heroes can be blocked and killed by your opponents. At this stage somebody has to take the leap and often lose in return.

We can be very short about the conclusion of this game. We just like it a lot! Short playing time. A lot is going on. There are some though decisions that have to be made during the game. The artwork is nice. The theme just works, you really are fighting the other team of superheroes. You get a lot of components for your money. And just look at the colors of the dice! It’s just fantastic!

Should you run to the store and get a copy of your own? Well, to be honest, that’s hard to say. Just as fantastic as this game is, there are some bad things about this one.

    The base game is not giving you much variation. When you have the base game alone, after 5 plays you’re about done. There isn’t much variation in the superheroes, and there are simply not enough dice in it, to give you the full experience. Lucky here are some cheap booster packs around to expand your team of superheroes and dice.
    It’s a collectible game. If you feel the need to have every single card available, don’t start with this game. We picked up a gravity feed, with 60 booster packs inside. 46 of the 120 cards were doubles. That’s over 30% I guess to get all of the cards. without trading you’ll need about 250 booster packs to get all the cards there are out there. That way you’ll have spend a huge amount of money to get a huge amount of dice and cards.
    The rules are bad written. Reading the rules, will leave you with tons of questions. It’s a shame, because the rules aren’t that hard. But you’ll have to go online to find some clarifications on the questions you’ll have after reading the rules.
    The dice bag are small. The dice bag that come with the base game, are just too small for people with big hands. Also the are made of (enforced) paper. They won’t last forever, if you’re going in and out with your hands a lot. You definitely want too but some descent cloth dice bags.
    The game comes without a playmat. Which is definitely needed to clarify the game-flow. Even in the rule-book, they use a playmat to make things clear. You can download it, and print it out yourself. But why isn’t it inside the game it-self? It’s almost impossible to play the game without playmats.
    The quality of the dice is very low. Corners of dice that are damaged. Numbers that are not painted. Different colors used on the same kind of dice that are in the base game and in the booster packs. Just some issues that there are with the dice. Too bad, because it’s just annoying.
    It won’t fit in the base game box. If you’ve bought a single booster pack, it won’t fit in the base game box anymore, and you’ll have to think about a storage solution.
    Cards in booster packs are damaged. And this really is a big issue. We now that it’s hard too put 2 dice and 2 cards inside some foil without getting the cards bend. If you can’t live with that, don’t start with this game at all.

We’ve never played Quarriors,but from what we have read about it, it’s a lot like this game. I guess if you own Quarriors,you won’t get happy with adding the Dice Masters game to your collection. In total we’ve spend over $100 to get the base game, boosterpacks, playmats and a storage sollution. I guess we also better could have bought the Quarriors game. But hey, what does it matter? The both of us like this game a lot. Isn’t that what’s it all about?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
UPDATE: Got old fast, I don't like how each character is represented in play by a die, I don't like that your characters don't stay in play after you've damaged your opponent with them. I don't like that when you buy a new die it goes into your dice bag and has no effect on play until you randomly draw it. I don't like that anyone can use your global abilities. Also it's collectible so only worth playing with a regular opponent who takes an active interest in building decks (teams). Only recommend it if you're super into the theme, otherwise there are better games.

Original review:

Can't figure out the target market for this game. It's quite abstract and weird to get your head round at first, yet it's actually a simple game. I printed off the game mats and stuck them to some card which really helped.

It plays like an efficiency engine game, it's difficult to react to opponent's strategies on the fly, since any new ability / character dice you buy during the game goes into your "deck" not your hand.

The artwork is good, the game is very colourful and rolling lots of dice is fun! Despite the slightly abstracted mechanics and slug fest, engine building feel of this game, I'm itching to play it some more. I'm not really into comics either!

The more I play, the more it seems too unbalanced, the colour arrangement on the board can mean you literally have one card in the deepest reach of every corner.

Its saving grace is that its easy to pick up and play with anyone, just don't take it too seriously.

RATING: 5
Quick and simple, very easy to teach, but there's a nice element of tension near the end as you hope nobody finishes before you. For such a simple game the strategy is opaque - sometimes I win, sometimes I don't and I don't know why.

Makes sure you play with the expansion (Vexation), it makes a big difference.

No significant differences to Trans America.  The map has rather more double track connections and potential routes across the North Sea seem fantastical.  The grid of connections seems to stand out from the background more.  That is something I would normally approve of, but here the result is unappealing to the eye.

RATING: 6
A light, modest game of connecting cities on a map of Europe.  Along the way, you'll want to piggy-back off other people's tracks to help you make your connections.  

Too much luck in card draw for various city locations, means there are times where you have almost no chance of winning.

Overall, a short, accessible and friendly game to play with non-gamers and families.

RATING: 8
A very simple to explain, easy to play, pleasing train game that played very nicely with six players.  

This is a fine example of a game design hitting a sweet spot wherein there is just enough in the game to enjoy for just about everyone in the...well...world.  

Being a train game, it once again demonstrates (like Ticket To Ride) that there is something curiously enjoyable about connecting cities on maps.  This one has fun with the idea in a very simple, obvious way, that is nevertheless, admirable from a game design point of view.

What I like about this game is that it actually provides the gamer with a very mellow player predictability challenge.  You don't have to blow a fuse trying to predict where other players are going to go on the board; you give it a little thought, have fun with your mellow player prediction, lay your tracks, and sit back and watch with mellow curiosity whether your predictions were correct.  It feels nice when you watch another player do what you predicted (and hoped) they would do.  Then, before you know it, it's your turn again. 

True, I am not going to love to play this game all the time, and the game is definitely not fireworks or exciting, but its design, quick play, ability to play with all groups and group sizes, underscores the fact that this a pretty darned good game. I would rather play this game than Ticket To Ride.

If you like the TransAmerica game, this version may appeal to you.  there are no new mechanics or tesists in the game - just a map change.  The map can be tough and the game feels slightly less refined and balanced than the original, but the game plays basically the same with the same light game play feel.  Overall, not as solid as the original, but a nice alternative looking edition. [GTI: TGCL]

I enjoy Transamerica.  After I gave my copy of this away I bought Trans Europa as a replacement.  Very disappointed.  Whilst it is exactly the same mechanics (a wasted opportunity) the artwork is less attractive and the cards don't show the city locations like Trans America (daft).

I guess railroads in the middle of the North Sea don’t have the same ambiance as the US map generates.  I also added a set of cubes to the components so that players knew who was who.  Not essential but enhanced the game after everyone kept asking who was which colour.

Sold Aug-08, as I don't need as I have bought TransAmerica again.

With identical rules to TransAmerica, which always stays within very easy reach of our game table, this alternate version was just bought to have a different map to play with.

p: And that's what we got, a different map. Not sure it is a better one though. Some people might like the larger spread of cities and the less crowded center of the map, but to me this has become too much a game of "who has the nice city-combo that just about guarantees a win". Yup, there are awkward combos in TransAmerica too, and when you play a 100 games I'm sure it all overages out somewhere down the line, but when the difference between winning and losing frequently results in scores of over 10 points, the initial hand-draw has become a tat too influential. In TransAmerica there is an intense requirement to make the most of every bit of track you lay.   Here that same sense of necessity  appears to be less urgent. In a 3-player game the unbalanced hand draws only seem to be even more of an issue, and where TransAmerica impressed me by how well it scales with any amount of players, TransEuropa's first impressions on me have been far less positive. I can see why certain players would come to the exact opposite conclusion, especially when they appreciate unpredictable swings, but I just don't. I quite like a healthy dose of chaos and luck, but only if they don't become the decisive factor.

Still, it's nice to break out of the east-west straightjacket at times, and this certainly will see regular table-time, but if I had neither and was only allowed to get one of the two I wouldn't hesitate and track down the original, with which I'm only one way from a perfect 10, with this one I've got an extra mountain to cross.

And Glasgow on the east coast. No! Wrong, wrong, wrong.

Even though they play the same, Transeuropa isn’t as fun as Transamerica: and since there’s no other difference between them than the map drawn on the board, the only reason I can find is the setting indeed, the boring Old Continent.

As per Transamerica, but on the european map. Dead simple idea to link up 5 cities, using one or two links per turn. First one to do it forces everyone else to lose points. First to lose 12 points triggers the end game. Still, luck of the draw and the ability to piggy back on someone elses building can make games pretty random.

A nice change of pace from TransAmerica.  Different enough from the original that it's worth rotating in just because my friends love and played the original so much.  TransAmerica and TransEuropa are two wonderfully simple fast engaging games that have great replay value because of the really nice short playing time, high interaction, and just plain fun.  Now I just wish I didn't suck at both games so bad!  UPDATE--after several playings of TransEuropa I can honestly say that this is the better game.  While TransAmerica's map is much more East-West, TransEuropa's map is much more amorphous with lots of locations that might not be difficult in theory but in combination with others turn downright ugly.  The last game I played the player on 1 point managed to finish and cause three players to go down 11 points! Another player went down 4 points also going out, and one player went down three points to 1 resulting in a tie game - at 1 point! That kind of swing was missing in TransAmerica requiring the early game ending rule.  No need for that here! If you liked TransAmerica, you really owe it to yourself to try TransEuropa.

A nice family game in that it plays 6 people (so grandparents can join in), it takes just a minute to learn, and it has a mix of strategy and luck that enables kids and adults to play together.  Plus, the kids learn a little geography.  The components and board are high quality too.

Still, the game is almost too simple.  Each time with it feels like the other times with it.  So I get a bit more bored with it each time.

However, no regrets about buying it:  a 6-person mixed ages board game is a rare bird, and it is great to have this to pull out during relatives' visits.

UPDATE:  Absolutely this is one of our most played games with my family of four and the grandparents.

Transamerica is a favourite (see comments there on gameplay) so I was sure I would enjoy this and I did.  Overall I think I still prefer the original map, though that's marginal.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
All my comments from TransAmerica apply here. 

The reason for the lower rating is due to usability and a less balanced map.

The cards in TransAmerica show you where the city is located, this is helpful when someone doesn't know the city in question. The cards in TransEuropa show you a picture of a monument from that city, this doesn't help you find your city on the map. In a game where you want to keep secret from the other players what cards you are holding, forcing you to scan the map such that everyone can watch you, is not a good idea.

The mountain ranges and rivers in TransAmerica are fairly balanced, creating some more or less equal zones. In TransEuropa, the Scandinavian countries and the British Isles are harder to reach then the other cities in those colours and can lead to players being severely disadvantaged in play. Note, I think very good players can play around that, but beginner players tend to simply give away the game. Which I find unsatisfying.

I put this just slightly above Transamerica right now.  With many players, Transamerica can really drag, but with the sheer number of double routes in the game, this one doesn't do that.  A game this simple should be fast and this one is.  I don't buy into others bagging how some cities are brutal to have....hello, remember Boston?  This is a card game played over several hands.  In card games, sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you.

For such a simple set of rules, this is a surprisingly tense and fun little game. Every turn, you place two route pieces. That's it. The tension is in trying to make your connections and sponge off other people. 

Fun game, my wife really liked it. This is something I might pick up at some point.

While don't absolutely dislike TransAmerica as an ultra-light, but not totally unfun filler, I find this to be a complete rip-off, with horrible art work (I just don't get the appeal of Claus Stephan's 'art'), and thematically challenged (railway tracks on the Mediterranean).

TransEuropa is inoffensive track building. I'm a bit at a loss to explain what people see in this game. I'll admit there is a bit of wait-and-see going on, but how that translates into making winning moves is unclear to me as there is really no way of speeding up your own moves save by latching onto other railroad networks. The only thing which seems to be at all interesting is your initial placement for that in large part decides the efficiency of your later moves, but other than that... No. I don't think I would even play this game with children, although they might like the appearence of a rail network.

RATING: 7
Simple railroad game that plays very quickly.  Trans Europa is a multi-player game that involves connecting certain cities via rail as quick as one can.  This is a good game for killing time at the end of the night or when waiting for another player to show up who's running late.  Most games play in 20 - 40 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This very light game feels like the natural precursor to Ticket to Ride, with players working off each others' routes instead of claiming their own.  It also adds a feeling like gin rummy, in that you reveal your city cards when you have them all connected.

This game takes literally 5 minutes to teach and barely 20 to play.  Simple, light fun - I wouldn't turn down a play in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very light, but also very fast, and no place for analysis paralysis. That's how games should be played! Fast, no thinking, bam! Game's over, next game! 

The first time I played it I was pretty underwhelmed, though. But the game really gets better over time.
The TransAmerica version is playable on BrettSpielWelt.

Recommended with the Schikane/Vexation expansion! It adds some strategic decisions, which is nice.

A lot of people complain about TransEuropa being shallow, and all-luck, no skill - but then why do I win and you don't?

The two player game just didn't work, vexation may have helped but the two player game is far too luck reliant of the card draw. The game won't go for more than 2 rounds so card draw luck generally will not even out.

A 4 player game is better but even still luck plays a big part.

I don't like the Europa version as much as the Americas one.

This is the rating for the base game together with the Vexation expansion.  The rating for the basic game is one point lower.  Nonetheless, this is the game that Ticket to Ride wants to improve upon and fails miserably, adding only length, luck and fiddlyness but no real depth. Here, there is none of that boring automatism of drawing cards one after another almost every round, but an altogether simpler and more efficient system. It is also a lot, lot quicker, which is a must for such a light game that TransEuropa definitely is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much here - prefer Ticket to Ride which is not much more complex (although the latter does play longer) and gives you more control and things to do.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great little filler. I have only played with the "advanced" rules that each player has three track pieces in their own colour that only they may use. This really spice up the game as you can block people and force them to build tracks around your piece. I can't see any reason not to play with it (just use roads from Settlers or put small differently coloured markers/beads on the track pieces).

Update: I now realize that the advanced rules are the expansion "Vexation". Without expansion I'd rate it a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
International edition of Trans America.  Essentially the same game on a different board.  Players take turns placing 2 pieces of track on a triangular gridded board.  First to connect track to their secret agenda of cities wins the round.  The only different rule I can spot is the silly "place piece of track across the VP track" after a couple of rounds has been removed.  Fun fluff.

A good quick game - basically the strategy comes down to who takes the most advantage of the shared network - so where you start from, and when to connect to another player are the big decisions (though where to place track is certainly important).

Rated 9 on first play (in which I lost horribly).  Rating upped to 10 having had the chance to explore the game more.  No, it's not super-complex but simple rules make it easy to teach and fast to play, and the theme is fun if, like me, you enjoy European train travel.  It plays quickly which makes it a good filler, though I never feel that one game is enough.

Strategy is very much about predicting - and using your placing to  influence - what others will build, so it's more interactive from the start than it first appears.

As an added bonus it's a great way of learning the local names for European cities for when you travel transEuropa for real, and the city cards all have pictures of a landmark from that city.

Like Marrakech, another light game I've brought to the table lately, it is fair to wonder how much game is really here.

Such a good game.  You want to know a secret?  Over the course of four rounds, everybody's scores should be almost identical.  The only way to mess things up is to make the game end sooner (ie., ensure that you lose so that somebody else wins).

Ignore anyone who claims that this game favors the first player.  Sure, they get their nth turn before everybody else, but guess what?  That means they benefit least from everybody else's plays, and they don't get an inkling as to where anybody else is about to play.

What a difference a map makes!

TransAmerica is one of my favourite games -- I rate it a 10. I'll happily defend it against accusations of luck-dependency any time.

But TransEuropa? The naysayers are right, the luck of the draw is far too great. The problem is the map -- there are cities that are better than others *in every possible situation*. (The same cannot be said of TransAmerica.) For example, London is *always* better than Dublin, Barcelona is *always* better than Madrid, Tirana is *always* better than Thessalonika, etc.

Very disappointing because I've played TransAmerica hundreds of times and a change of scenery would have been nice.

There is a certain amount of luck in the drawing of the cards, but since the game is short, it is not much of a problem.

RATING: 7.5
Score given is for version with Vexation expansion included. Plays quickly and has some interesting dynamics although getting the balance of how often to play the colored tracks is hard to gauge. Some rounds you simply have farther to go than other people and it doesn't work, which can be a little frustrating, but usually it's an interesting mix of route building and trying to get others to work for you. Short play time is a plus, should make it easier to get to the table.

This is the easiest railroad-themed game I know of.  Very easy to introduce to newbies, but not very compelling for me.

I recently played a 7-player game of TransEuropa, and it was fun -- all cities were in play on every turn, so there was lots of co-operation (and lots of stalling, hoping that other people would get you closer to your destinations).

Broke out the copy of this one finally, for some play comparison.  Like Trans America, this is a nice little train game, especially if you don't have time for Ticket to ride.

The Europe map creates different choke points, and the art might appeal less or more to some (I think I prefer the stronger brighter lines and colors of Trans America slightly on 1st impression,) but the gameplay and flow will be similar.

I expect that playing this with Vexation expansion much of the time would also make the point swings between winner & loser much greater - as I observed with Trans America in some ways the original game may be better (or at least closer) without it.

I still think it would be interesting to play Iron Road someday, but I think Trans Europa is a nice addition/change from the Trans America game, if you love the first one but want a slightly different challenge. It's not a required add-on, and I can also easily see people who owned one might not need the alternate version.

On a very quick take, I'd say this is slightly better than Trans America based on the map changes, but not enough to start this at better than a 7, matching its older sibling.

I played this recently and won in two rounds, having lost no points while two opponents fell off the score track.  I'm told that another game the day before had a winner after just one round.  Either my friends really stink, or this isn't as balanced as it's American sister.

However, in spite of all those who say it's "just like TransAmerica", it's a very different strategy, and the game is different enough to warrant having (or at least playing) both.

This game is pretty much the same game as Trans America.  It still gets a six.  It's light fun, but really anyone can win.  I have noticed (I've played this one about 5 times) that the points people are off by are larger than in trans america games I play.  So it's possible this game will play faster than transamerica (if that's possible).

Quite luck dependent in what cards you, and everyone else, get. Most of the skill is in working out (guessing) what track you can get other people to build for you, and trying to make sure you have track that you need to build yourself when it's your turn. Very light and quite quick - falls in that thin slot between filler and game.

Easy and fun game. Good family game. We made an interesting mistake when learning it; we played one piece per turn instead of two.

Jan09: Well darn, that just wasn't as cool.  I actually really like TransAmerica, but this one just didn't do it for me.

The areas just aren't as smooth.  The east-west run of America works much better than the pie chart of Europe.

I might keep it around for awhile, but it's just not as smooth.  People kept getting cut *really* hard from round to round.  The map just isn't as pretty too.  I don't really like the crayon art.

I came to this (and its parent TransAmerica) late after playing more complex network-building games, and I have to say there's a lot to be said for keeping it simple. It's not Railroad Tycoon/18whatever or the like but it gives you a good buzz in a much shorter playtime.

Scoring over a number of 5-minute rounds is good, as if you mess up one round there will be others to play. (Some network builders can be very unforgiving of a poor opening round or three).

Scores seem to be tight - apart from the odd blooper most players score similarly (I suspect largely because they end up sharing the same network), so I'm not sure how much long term play it has.

A connection game where players join their links into a shared network. You try to make additions that are useful to you while not being as useful to others. While I commend the designer for not heaping lots of extra design elements on a simple idea, I'm not sure that all by itself it works that great as a game. At some point you'll just be down to lowering your score penalty by 2 each turn and hoping the round won't arbitrarily end. As pointed out by Morgan Dontanville the scoring system is also awkward, as getting hit the hardest in the first round (due to bad luck or whatever) leaves you in an almost impossible position.

TransAmerica with a different board. Map seems more random, which exaggerates the scoring issues. Only played Harald Gruber's computer version, but I suspect it may actually be better that way.

[LUP 29-Nov-2006] We have [i]TransAmerica[/i] so I don't see the point in getting this as well.  The graphic design of the cards is not as good as [i]TransAmerica[/i] which has the map and city marked on the map on the card.  [i]TransEuropa[/i] has neglected to include this user friendly feature whilst having the local language version of city names making it doubly hard for people to find cities.  A silly omission in my book.  On the plus side it omits the silly move the scoring line rule that is in [i]TransAmerica[/i] (although not in the BSW implementation I notice).  In the games of this we have played we noticed the scores were consistently higher than we find for [i]TransAmerica[/i].  I am not sure if that is due to the  map of just luck of the draw in the games we played.

There's a little more to this game than first meets the eye, but not much.  Most of the strategy seems to be in the initial placement of your start marker -- after that you just have to hope the other players help you out more than you help them.  If you succeed in that and didn't get stuck with an impossible combination of cards, you should be in good shape.

I expected to dislike this game but there is some enjoyment to be had here!  There is definitely luck of the draw involved here as you draw your destination cities and you can be stuck with a horrendous route but there is some charm in trying to figure out where your opponents might be going and trying to set yourself up to use their track to get to your destinations first.  Vexation adds in a little more difficulty but I'm not sure if it adds in enough to make it worthwhile.

Maybe it is the mathematician in me, but I like this game of building networks. The only down side is that rotten locations can screw you and the game is over before the "luck of the draw" has a chance to even things out.

Although I think the map is better, TransAmerican is more familiar so it is easier to teach to new gamers.

GET TransAMERICA (not this one)...

Cards in TransAMERICA are better since they show city locations and TransEuropa tends to have a number of inaccuracies as to where various cities are (making it tougher to find locations esp if you are visual); thereby making is a slower game (esp if played with kids) and minimizing the educational aspect. As well, TransEuropa can create runaway round leaders because of its high points and its being less forgiving; thereby making it less enjoyable for playing with kids who may feel like they're out of the race too soon.

If you are expecting a classic like Ticket to Ride, you will be sorely disappointed. This game has a lot going for it, but ultimately it lacks any real decisions. It is impossible to prevent or even prolong anyone from connecting routes and once all routes are tied together, it is mostly a luck game with which drags out.

At first glance this game seems incredibly stupid. Give it a few trys though and you will see that there are actually a lot of interesting decisions to be made.As a light game i like it a lot. More effort could have been put into the presentation though (this map is even uglier than the USA one).

A light, accessible track building game that you could teach anyone.  Enough strategy that a better player will win, but the sort of game where a new player is definitely in with a chance.  It's too simple to see our table regularly, but is in our collection because it fills a nice niche when we have the right crowd for it.  We almost always play it with it's expansion, Vexation.  Without it, I'd rate the game lower.

Könnyed vasútvonal építgetős játék. Sok játékossal jó, gondolkodni nem nagyon kell és szórakoztató.
Eléggé kiszámíthatatlan, hogy ki fog nyerni. Hiába gondolod úgy a játék elején a célkártyáid alapján, hogy esélytelen vagy, mert gyakran előfordul, hogy a többi játékos pont úgy építget, hogy azzal neked segít.
Legtöbbször kicsik a különbségek; sokszor előfordul, hogy ugyanabban a körben többen is be tudnák fejezni a játékot.

Exceeded my expectations. Nice, little route-builder. I definitely prefer playing TransEuropa+, which includes Vexation/Schikane. Apparently there are two variations of the Vexation rule: either you get three own track per round or per game. Per round is definitely the better rule.

Suggest.

RATING: 7
My wife received this for Christmas.

Compared to TransAmerica, TransEuropa forces a player to think more in terms of spokes from a wheel rather than east-west.  The rules are almost exactly alike, so the major difference is the game board.

This ain't Age of Steam, it's not Rail Baron, it's not Ticket to Ride.  All the game is is a quick track laying exercise and making your opponent do most of the work for you.  That's all.  The game isn't tough to grasp, and it certainly isn't deep.  If you keep the game in perspective, it'll work for you.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game certainly seemed like all luck at first glance: draw a bunch of cities that are far apart, and you'll do worse than when they're closer together. The end? Well, after reading a few comments and reviews on this game, I suppose I should give it another chance, but I can't say I'm really chomping at the bit to do so.

Like TransAmerica, a great low-complexity game.

Marred a little by having crude artwork on the destination cards rather than a map with the location of the city as in TransAmerica.  This can really matter when playing with non-English speakers.

A good network building game. You need to get your cities connected, but you'll need to work with the other players. But building to your city will probably get them closer to theirs. It's important to try and not be the person who spends their turn just connecting two separate routes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's light and random, but the games are short and I'm having fun playing it. There's a lot of tension into each game, because you don't know to what cities exactly your rivals are going, you don't know if you're helping them or not, you don't know when the game is going to end...

The rules are explained and understood in a couple of minutes and the games should not last more than half an hour.

I don't recommend to play it with 5-6 players though, as people say. The downtime kills the tension and the game becomes too random.

RATING: 6
Simple rail laying game with secret goals. I think this is the best "secret goal" mechanic game I've played. The rules are super simple and game is good if you play it with expansion that adds personal tracks for every player. Rating is when played with an expansion. Without the expansion I'd still rate this as a 4.

This game is awesome! And I don't mind owning TransAmerica  as well! My wife and I play them both interchangeably. TransEuropa is a longer game usually because you play until one player runs off the track (zero pts) and there is a slight difference in strategy, due to the geography differences. Connect your tracks to reach 5 cities before your opponent! Our games always conclude with the losing player taking their train marker down the score track with a dramatic train crash demonstration! Takes the sting off the loss!!!

OWN Jan/07.  My parents bought TransAmerica for themselves for Christmas, stealing from my wishlist.  Therefore, I went with the Europe version.

I do wish it had the usual English names for the cities, even if just as a subheading below the native names.

I like the pictures on the cards.  The maps on the TransAmerica version were fairly unnecessary anyhow, so these pictures of portions of the cities are neat.

Great game, plays along the lines of laying tracks as in ticket to ride without the need for train cards with 1 or 2 tracks each turn.

(The rating is only with the expansion, without it it's 4).
It's a slightly more appealing map than the map of America and not only because I live in Europe. Somehow the Nordic two-rail mazes and Russian peripheria can make your game quite hard. Especially when nobody has no targets even near to you.
'nuff said, TransEuropa is better.

Pretty much the same game as Transamerica. I do enjoy this game also I would recommend playing it with the Vexation extension as it might be seriously underwhelming otherwise. The European map is a wee more chaotic and harder in my opinion, although some argue about this point. The basic premise is a simple as it gets and the game is after all very luck based if you have evenly skiller players which might put more serious gamers off. Not much of a theme either. I do enjoy it however, if only for the short time it takes to play and pick up.

It's quite different to Ticket to Ride because players can share routes (apart from the variant with the coloured tracks).  Lots of fun and easy to learn, lots of luck.

Perguntava-me se havia muito mais para se retirar de um jogo de comboios além do que se consegue com Ticket to Ride; pois bem, estava enganado e TransEuropa é a prova disso mesmo! Ainda mais simples que o anteriormente referido, este é um jogo para chulos, prontos para retirar proveitos da obra alheia. Obrigatório!

RATING: 7.7
A very good game that is very easy to learn but has some hidden strategy.    More options and strategy with more players.  A game that anyone can learn and enjoy with their beer and pretzels. This has a little one up on Trans America because the map is a little more variable with respect to double tracks, also the end game has been streamlined.  No putting rail on the track after two rounds.  It just end once someones train crosses the 12 point.

Pros: it’s fast and turns are quick. Cons the initial placements really can hamstring you. Yes you can make an educated guess on where others will build to take advantage but little too much luck for my taste.

Same mechanics as TransAmerica, but the map is much more difficult, meaning more points are lost each round, and the game ends sooner.

Nagyon kellemes, egyszerű játék a Trans Europa. A térképen 5 színből 7-7 város van elhelyezve, amiket sínek kötnek össze. A játékosok véletlenszerűen kapnak minden színből egy várost és ezeket kell összekötniük. Minden körben két sínt rakhatnak le a játék kezdetén lehelyezett kezdőpontjukból, majd ha más hálózatával összeér, akkor már oda is. Aki leghamarabb összeköti az 5 városát az nyer, a többiek a hiányzó sínek után 1-1 mínuszpontot kapnak. 13 mínuszpontot ha elér valaki vége a játéknak. Ennyi az egész. Gyors, pörgős, bárkivel játszható, hatan is nekiülhetünk. Bármikor elővehető, a szerencsét pedig jól kiegyensúlyozza a több forduló. Tetszett. Erős hatos.

A suprisingly good, fast and, when adding the three colored rails per player expansion, exciting railway building game.

This one's a keeper.

1 play, 2er

This is basically the same game as TransAmerica, with a few changes:
- Europe, obviously; not so good if your European geography sucks, but there are few enough cities (and they are color coded) so it's not so bad
- the city cards, instead of showing a miniature map with the city location highlighted, has a picture of some local landmark; pretty, but not terribly useful for game play

Well since the games are basically the same, I guess people should probably just play the map they're most familiar with. Even better, play that map with the [thing=29432]Vexation[/thing] expansion!

Very light route building game. If you are playing with a group of people who know what they are doing it can start to feel a bit deterministic. Playing with the Vexation expansion (you can just borrow colored track from another game if you don't have it, Catan roads worked for me) does add a bit more strategy to the game and I give it an extra .5 because of that.

A different challenge from TransAmerica.  This map is much more cluttered with terrain.  Do you pay the extra building costs or go around?  Then there is the challenge of locating the cities, well from an American point of view anyway.

Excellent filler game.  Scales well from 2 to 6, and plays quickly even with several rounds.  Easy to learn but several strategies to try.  Great entry game to introduce people to the hobby.

Umm, yeah, this one is Trans America on the Europe map.  I've played a lot of Trans America on BSW, and though I don't really like it all that much, I think it's a pretty decent enough game.

I picked this up for pretty good price at a flea market.  I've always wanted to try Trans America in real life as a gateway game and see what others actual reactions were to the game, but I've never wanted to pay full retail price for a copy, because I frankly don't think all that much of it.

However, at $5 i got it at; I'll keep it to play with kids and family, or the occasional gateway game, but it won't be a staple go to game.

RATING: 5
We play TransAmerica all the time and I really enjoy it.  I thought Trans Europa would be a nice change, but I find it has two problems.  1. the artwork does not include where on the map the cities are and you can spend ages looking in the wrong place for towns, especially ones in the East, that you are not familiar with.  2. The length of routes and accessibility of cities is not so cleverly balanced as in the original and if you are genuinely unlucky with the cards it can be impossible to catch up.

Very simple and very quick game. Would never turn down a game but not really suggest it. I am not sure if there is any strategy to it. It is probably just luck and paying enough attention.

This feels like a lighter version of Ticket to Ride. There's no card drafting and there's a slightly different strategy in that you can make use of your opponents' tracks, but otherwise it does scratch the same itch.

RATING: 6.5
A very lightweight connection game. You need to have your assigned cities connected or as close as possible to the shared network by the time the first person connects all of theirs.

Sure, it's light, but it's a nicely appealing filler. I particularly appreciate the game when played with the Vexation expansion. A good game to have around when playing with folks who appreciate lighter games, or as a decent filler game. Pleasantly fast to explain the rules.

Nice quick, simple family game.  Playable with kids (our older daughter easily picked it up at 6) but has real strategy to it.  I think this (like TransAmerica) works best with at least 4 and preferably 5 or 6, but is playable with 3 as well.  After a number of plays on each map, I think I clearly prefer the way Transamerica sets up, and rate that version a full point higher.

Picked up at Origins 2005.  I have the exact same opinion of this as TransAmerica, so here is my comment on that:

Good light Train game.  Its almost a cooperative game, but it's really about how to best take advantage of other people's work.  There absolutely is some strategy, the problem is, I do not seem to have enough interest in the game to learn it, and my interest level is falling.

Same as TransAmerica but with a Europe board: a simple railroad game, shorter and easier than Ticket to Ride, but much different game, easy to learn, and great for kids. Simple enough to be considered a filler game, to play in between intense games; yet if you play with the 'Vexation' expansion's colored tracks (which came included with my copy), there's a lot more strategy as you can place your three special tracks strategically to gain a tempo or two over your opponents. Out of print and hard to find, so grab it if you ever see one for cheap.

Like its cousin [gameid=2842], this game is a nice light fare for non-gamers.  Best in large groups, that allow for much more capitalizing on other players' track.

Good introductory game for non gamers. Its strength is its quick playtime and simplicity in rules.

It is essentially a network building game. Every player on their turn places track on the gameboard in an attempt to connect cities that they are interested in. The cities of interest for each player is different and hidden from others. 

The twist is that you can use other players track to complete your connections. So the game is about taking advantage of other people's routes while helping them as little as possible with your own.

Great game. Players have a set of hidden objective cities on a map of Europe, and there is a collective pool of tracks that we each use 2 of on our turn. The winner of the round declares when all their locations have been connected to end the round. Rounds continue until a single player misses out on a certain amount of tracks. As players can help each other unknowingly, there is a lot of deduction and a little bit of bluffing. Good, light, exciting and fun.

Players work together building a railroad network, the first to have their five cities connected wins the round - the others lose points for being too slow! After one player has lost 12 points, the player with the most points wins the game!

Trans America - Trans Europes. Potato/potata.
Both are good.

Omits the silly "adjust the train" rule from TransAmerica and freshens up the geograhy and my weak pronunciation skills.  No doubt you can tell my nationality without looking at my profile.

This is a nice and QUICK train building game. Exact same rules as Trans America. I was in a 2 player game that went 4 rounds and kept drawing Roma on every single turn. That was kind of funny.

I played this once and was a little underwhelmed with the amount of decisions required to play it. Namely, very few. Still, for people who are new to gaming or for kids, it would be quite enjoyable. It's by no means a bad game, but just not enough there for me I guess.

etwas netter als Trans Amerika wegen der heimischeren Karte.

Just bought this at Origins.  I love TransAmerica and play it on BSW.  I am looking forward playing with a new track.

Pack con TransAmerica y la expansión vexation. 20€.

RATING: 5
A basic game that is easy to pick up and the main strategy is just to make use of the synergy of other players' tracks as much as possible. The starting player may be at an disadvantage and the final player may enjoy an advantage. The choice of destination cards also makes it somewhat luck-driven. There also is not much theme to talk about. Game components are ok, while artwork is quite primitive.

I had rated this an average game, after a tedious first play with some highly competitive family. I introduced it to some gamer friends, and we had a blast dicking each other over with the Vexation pieces, and the game turned out to be the quick playing filler that I wanted.

Not very different from TransAmerica, although the setup of the cities seem to be a lot better than its counterpart.  I would say I'd prefer this map a little more if I'm pressed to play it (thus the slightly higher rating by 0.5).  Even so, not a game I really care for.

The map seems much harsher than TransAmerica's, but good stuff nonetheless.  I like that the city cards have landmarks on them.  I dislike that they no longer have a minimap, which means that you can't just glance at your cards to form a vague plan for connecting the cities.

Do the publishers and the author know Europe's map ?
Unbelievable.

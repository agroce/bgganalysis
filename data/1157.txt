A silly game with an engaging player board and fun standup figures. However, simple mechanics and 'Munchkin' style player interruption sink this game before it has a chance to swim.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easier to play with a larger group than its predecessor, but ultimately lacks the humour of the original, meaning all but the hardiest gamer tends to loose interest before the end. Its a shame, because in so many ways this should be superior to Kill Doctor Lucky.

The "sinking ship"/shrinking board mechanic is pretty cool, but I think this one still suffers from the same "we played for a while, then someone ran out of failure cards and someone won" problem I felt in KDL.

RATING: 8
Don't know why this isn't rated higher. I love this game. It is a lot of fun and you can strategize to go multiple times in a row. When I bought this game we played it (6-7 player games) multiple times that first two weeks. Every day we played it because we liked it so much. Now that gaming group has moved to different places and I haven't found the right people. But I still can't wait to play it again. Very fun and awesome theme. I love how the board gets smaller as the "ship sinks." Very clever mechanics here.

In our one play this seemed much much easier than Killing Doctor Lucky, although it probably should be since it comes before the other game. Probably best with a couple more people, more roleplaying and a game of KDL right afterwards.

RATING: 2
This game is great fun at first thanks to the puns and jokes. As is kill doctor Lucky. The jokes aren't as funny as kill doctor Lucky, but I think - ignoring the humour- it is a better game. It is a better game for the wrong reasons. There is a mechanic in place to shorten the play time. Which makes you grateful, because once the jokes become boring, there is no more fun to be had and luckily the game will make sure it wil end as fast as possible. Only it still takes too long despite of this.

Why is the game too long? Well, it is like playing Russian roulette. But a long drawn out Russian Roulette. For both games (Kill and Save doctor Lucky) one player will eventually get "Lucky" enough to kill/save doctor Lucky. Not becuase of good play, Just because no fucking reason at all. So it's as deep as a game of goose. A long drawn out game of goose. And, just like in game of goose, occasionally you'll have to skip a turn. Why? Because the game is mechanically broken. At least game of goose limits it to a turn of a few seconds, in kil and save doctor Lucky you can keep skipping turns for hours on end. That is what really breaks both games. 

In short: "Kill doctor Lucky"'s jokes are better, "Save doctor Lucky"' has mecanics that prevent the game of taking 3 hours to play. Because of the lower chance of a time consuming torture, "Save doctor Lucky" is the better game. But don't get me wrong, "Save doctor Lucky" is still TOO long.

I found this a little better than the original and very complementary to it. The gradually sinking ship puts a definite time limit on the game and, in contrast to the original, this game will get shorter with more players ('Kill' gets longer as you add more). THe text on the cards adds some funny touches too.

Played it with 7 players - and it was complete chaos.
In a full game I only got three turns because of all the skipping. This game is probably a lot better with less players; 3-4.

Also, I miss the Spite tokens from "Kill Doctor Lucky", which obviously would be "save"-tokens in this game.

Really like that the boardgame is shrinking as the ship sinks. Also neatly set up with the cards and card layout.

Interesting game in that you play against everyone but you also have to work with everyone when someone does try to go for the win.  Game moves pretty quick, seems to go quicker with more people.  I like that the disappearing board all but guarantees the game won't drag too long.  The game is simple enough to teach anyone quickly, seems to work well with casual gamers.  I like that it supports 7 people but probably works better with 4ish. There is some luck with the card draws but you can plan your moves well enough that it gives it enough strategy too.  Overall good party/filler type game.

Parts of it were cute.  I enjoyed watching the ship sink.  I also enjoyed setting up a ride on the "Doctor Lucky Train".  The flavor text was priceless.

I'm really not a fan of the "pass the buck" game play though.  I really just see no reason to play my own failure cards unless I'm the last person with a chance to do so.  It's just not an interesting decision since I'll always pass the buck on.

NL: het "tegenovergestelde" spel van Kill Doctor Lucky. Nu moet je hem redden van een zinkende boot die steeds kleiner wordt. Heb 'm al jaren, maar nog steeds niet uitgespeeld, want 'm vermoorden blijft leuker...

Okay game. I think it can drag on a bit long just because of all the conditions that need to be met to save him, and how easy it can be to stop it. A lot of luck involved, but still enough strategy that it's not terrible.

RATING: 5
The 'anti-'Kill Doc Lucky' which is itself an 'anti-Cluedo'!

There's a little bit more to do in this spin off game, with the sinking ship adding a good timed element to the game. Interestingly though I found [i]Kill Doctor Lucky[/i] to be more satisfying. Is it just the difference between Kill and Save? Or was the original just right as it was?

Either way game play still feels like you are wasting time throwing cards at the Doc until you finally get lucky and play a card nobody else can counter.

I enjoyed it enough when I played it, but it received little interest and in the end I wasn't sad to see it go.

RATING: 7
It lacks the mean-spirited quality of Kill Doctor Lucky (its actual forte), but the small adjustments make it a more refined, clearly superior game - no overlength, no static players loading up cards a whole half hour, no abrupt ends... it's trickier as well to be close to Dr. Lucky and in the other players' sight without being too close to them. Overall the game is still more entertaining than heady, and more so relying less on the surprise factor of the cards -the jokes are obviously not as much fun (you can't top killing Doctor Lucky with soured cream), but the play doesn't suffer from ignoring them.

I Know I said Killing Dr Lucky is fun, however due to this games unique mechanics its just as much fun to save him. The ship is sinking and you must save the good Doctor, however as the game progresses more and more of the board is submerged underwater.

Didn't like it as well as Kill Dr Lucky, which held together better. Given a choice I prefer the other game and can pass on this one.

I think that this is better than KDL, but still is kind of long.  Once again, tough to bring this out when I have so many other options that are much shorter and at least as much fun.  I like the "sinking ship" mechanic, which limits the game time.  Also, the text on the cards is hillarious, as opposed to KDL where there really isn't any flavor text.  If I were to go for one of the two, this would be it.  Similar, but better, mechanics compared to KDL and better humor factor.

This game has fixed all the problems I saw in Kill Doctor Lucky.  It has a built in timing function (the ship is sinking on you...the board literally disappears...it is pretty cool!) and gets rid of the spite token.  This is a great, fun, game that will appeal to a wide audience. I will admit the cards in the Kill version were better, though.  So they've fixed the game....but they broke the best part of the original (which was the funny cards/story), which kind of sucks.(JW)

I am still not really that into this game. It has it's advantages over the Kill Dr. Lucky but I just don't think it is that great. Long and can be boring on the other players turns. (RW)

I actually think this is a better game than Kill Doctor Lucky -- the sinking ship mechanic is very cool.  But the humor and the flavor just don't match up, so this tends to sit on the shelf.  Too bad.

This does get points as the game which rekindled my interest in Cheapass Games, which probably led to me being the gamer I am today.  So, props for that, and thanks Kim Gilbeau for bringing this on that Jan Term trip to the Bahamas!

This isn't nearly as much fun as kill Dr luck.  In Kill Dr Lucky, you get spite tokens for failed attempts which over time increase your likelihood of succeeding.  In this game, it's more of a war of attrition as you try and fail and hope that someone doesn't have enough fail cards to stop you.  The "ship" does shrink over time which makes getting around quicker but that doesn't really add to the game itself.  It just makes later rounds go faster.  We bought this for our 8 year old since he liked Kill Doctor Lucky and he seems to enjoy it so there's that...

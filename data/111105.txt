My problem with this game is that it tries to do too much.  It's as if a game designer kept adding new features without removing any old ones.  It was fun the two times I've played it, but it's too inaccessible for newer players.  The best part is the story but overall it would probably do better as a choose your own adventure book.

Rating based on one play.

As a lover of co-ops, and having recently acquired my first story-telling game (Mice and Mystics) I was looking forward to this game.  Having watched it through KS, I was tempted to pull the trigger but ultimately decided to wait.  I'm glad I did.

I can see some people loving this game but it simply isn't in the same league as Pandemic, Flash Point or Mice and Mystics.

A neat cooperative storytelling game set in a pulp spy movie setting that actually has a bit of a game behind it. The rules are not particularly well written and do a disservice to a game that is actually rather simple to play. The choices in the stories here make a lot more sense than in Tales of the Arabian Nights and SMERSH has completely replaced that game for us.

My rating for this game will probably NOT change, unless the top end of the rating scale is raised. As of now this is the highest rating possible for me to give it... 

I was a Kickstarter backer. So excited to play this with my gaming group. BEST gaming experience ever. Complete enjoyment. A must buy. A must play.

I really love Eldritch Horror I feel like I'm in the story and everything just makes sense with the way it works. Same with this.  Agents of SMERSH really puts you into the 70s spy imagery.
 
In a word, FANTASTIC.

Does everything Tales of the Arabian nights does, but better. (Well, okay, it doesn't use the 1001 nights as inspiration, but cold war era spies instead)

Pros over Arabian Nights:
-Cooperative
-The timer works better than AN's goals
-No constant pilgrimage or "go home to tell the family" type conditions
-Encounters make a little more sense in relation to what is chosen on the matrix and your advanced skills

Cons:
-Less fantastical setting

Neutral:
-More dice rolling

Obviously similar to Arabian Nights, but a bit detached as you don't get the feeling of personal interaction prior to the event happening.  It's more like you show up in a scene already happening, but not sure how you got there.

Still lots of fun, even if the ending is a bit anti-climactic.

Ameritrash at its finest, with some great storytelling.  Don't bother with the card-based quests, use the Book of Encounters!  Assuming you have a group that's into storytelling, this game is a great deal of fun.

Simple mechanics and not overly long, between 90 and 120 mins.

RATING: 7
The first time I played this, it was with two players. Agents of SMERSH seemed way too easy. We won without much challenge at all. 

I played the second time with 4 people and liked it much better this way. Things seemed more balanced as we needed to defeat more henchmen and intel got removed much more often making the game more of a challenge. We still won, but it was more fun. 

Pros 
- I love the encounter book. The encounters are well written and quite comical at times. 
- Cool theme
-Playing the James Bond Theme Song while revealing your pooled intel is very entertaining. 

Cons
- Sliding your secret mission cards under your player board is such a hassle. I was always afraid of knocking all my cubes off.
- Passing encounters is easy most of the time unless it's an encounter with intel. 
-I wish that the reaction chosen for encounters had more to do with the advanced skills needed to pass (ex. I had the "stealth" advanced skill and tried to choose reactions that I thought align with that trait. Usually didn't work out that way).
-I feel like the henchmen are too easy to beat. 
-The encounter book is SUCH a pain to use. The rings used to hold the book together are constantly falling apart and coming out of the holes in the pages. 
-The art leaves much to be desired.

Far too random and far too much bookkeeping for my tastes. The book of encounters is fun, the rest of the game drags it down.

Update 20160820 - after a few more plays, I've enjoyed this game a bit more; it's possibly just not the game I was expecting it to be when I started. The showdown booklet that IIRC came from the 2nd ed. KS helps a bit, too.

Tales of the Arabian Nights is one of my favourite games, so I eagerly anticipated this one.

Hmmm.  Flavour-wise it's excellent, just what I had hoped for.  Quite happy with that aspect.  If you like TotAN's paragraph-driven gameplay then you'll like this too.  And I do.

Unfortunately in my opinion it doesn't work well in a co-operative setting, where the random results can make a win unreachable for everyone, and there's nothing you can do about it.

Most co-ops are harder to win than 50/50, as they should be, so players can learn more and cooperate better so as to win after a few attempts. However, this game is very close to [i]completely random[/i], meaning further plays don't much improve skill.

ToTAN is like that too, and I don't mind it there. It's "a bunch of random stuff happens to you, then someone wins." Which is fine, I lose this time but I might win the next one. But SMERSH is a [i]very difficult[/i] co-op, so it's "a bunch of random stuff happens to you, then everyone loses." And it will be that way pretty much every time you play, which makes it hard to be motivated to want to keep playing. 

I recommend generously tweaking the rules to make the game easier. If we can get it to 50/50 then I'll be happy.

RATING: 6.25
A fairly straightforward reskin of Tales of the Arabian Nights, SMERSH trades some of that game's literary elegance for 60s spy television. Everything about SMERSH feels slightly overdone; there's a few too many skills, a few too many mechanics to track that inevitably pull you out of the story, and it doesn't purge any of the narrative randomness that can mar a game of TotAN. An ambitious attempt at making a new game in an underrepresented genre but it needed a few more revisions to really make it sing.

I was a Kickstarter backer. I'd seen my favorite youtubers do reviews so when I saw that the campaign for a 2nd edition was running I RUSHED to spend my cold hard suisse francs for EVERYTHING. I mean the 2nd edition base came, the new swagman's nope expansion, a new scenario book, the handpainted dr. lobo bust, and all the kickstarter extras you could imagine.

I was so excited to play this with my students and family and gaming group. I'd told them all throughout the semester about this game where they'd play as characters in a cold war story. We ALL were very excited.

Worst gaming experience ever. Complete letdown. Do not buy. Do not play.


GOOD STORY TELLING GAMES:

I really love Eldritch Horror. Buy that. 

Buy Fortune & Glory. 

Buy Tales of Arabian Nights.

***The 7th Continent*** (a brand new game that looks like a beautiful innovation in storytelling games has now brightened up my boardgaming year. I was pretty bummed about not having a new st game this year BUT it's great to see this coming soon. i'll take a shot on this one without waiting for the reviews.)

Buy ANYTHING but this overpriced soggy steaming pile of cardboard.

GOOD COLD WAR GAMES:

If you're looking for a Cold War themed game I have Twilight Struggle (the #1 game on here for a reason), 

Cold War: CIA vs. KGB, 

and Codename: Oracle.

But Agents of S... in a word: Nope.

C'est la vie.

Take it or leave it for what it is.  This is 90% Tales of the Arabian Nights, 10% Pandemic.  It suffers from a few things:  1) typos and grammar, 2) vague descriptions where the reactions don't seem to match, 3) a sense of uncontrollable future loss if things tip the wrong way at all, which means people get a little antsy about finishing.

However, it is Arabian Nights-like.  The stories are over the top and as long as people can keep their heads in the game and not get distracted, it is fun.

RATING: 7
2016  Second impressions - Encounters are fun (and there are lots of them!) and the game nails the 70s James Bond theme. The game is heavily swingy and random, and bad luck or bad draws during the first few turns can easily doom your entire game as penalties accrue and the villain track drops. It is less the luck factor, instead it is the heavy penalization of normal bad luck in the game that drops down the rating and my desire to play this game.
***Also includes Swagman's Hope, kickstarter promos, and Showdown.

Silly fun. The campy, Austin Powers theme really comes through and unlike other storytelling games (like Tales of the Arabian Nights), this game does a good job at connecting your choices thematically with the results: you can actually make informed decisions on your turn, as opposed to just choosing a random option in the story.

The game is just too easy, though, by far. We've never even come close to losing, which makes it ultimately not very replayable. Fun nonetheless.

RATING: 7
Reasonably fun cooperative experience.  Very random, so make sure you enjoy that kind of game.  The game is actually quite simple once you work your way through the terrible rulebook.  The result of your reaction choices often does not make logical sense - but that's OK I guess for this kind of "experience" game.  Unlike many coop games, this one is harder with more players, which can be a good thing depending on your typical group size.  The paragraph book is a chore - it would be so much better if 8th Summit provided a searchable PDF or dedicated iOS/Android app.  

Overall I am fine with the game.  It's not a favorite, but I'll play it if others want to.

RATING: 7
A well designed and conceived "story game", where the focus is a little more on the narrative than the actual game play.  Due to this, is will obviously draw comparisons to a popular predecessor in this genre, Tales of the Arabian Nights.

However, unlike Tales, there's actually a game here on top of the stories and action-filled adventures!  You are chasing down a crew of Dr. Lobo's minions, collecting evidence along the way to nab Dr. Lobo.  While you;re doing this, you'll encounter all sorts of stuff, with full-fledge stories provided by the adventure book in a choose-your-own-adventure style affair.

Throughout the game, you will pile up evidence which you'll need to win.  However, the amount and type of evidence you'll need depends on how often you fail on various tasks throughout the game.  If you fail too often, you'll flat out lose.  However, once you trigger the game end (by beating Dr. Lobo's minions enough times), you reveal the evidence you collected and compare it to what was required.  If you match or exceed the requirement, you win!

Overall, a very solid and impressive take on the choose-your-own adventure story genre, and one I will likely play over Tales just because there's actually a game with real achievable goals here.

Dripping with theme, but gameplay is random and frustratingly so. The game mechanics make it seem to work but it just comes off as "meh". Maybe if the Intel had some notion of which skill it took to challenge it we could work together as a team to send people places. The end result is a slow version of Pandemic where we randomly rolled dice to see if we beat the "enemy" and it took hours to lose.

I've had one game of Agents of SMERSH and quite enjoyed myself with it. It has that Tales of the Arabian Nights feel but with a bit more game to it. The overall production was fairly good although I found the placing of cubes on top of your current skill value to be annoying: firstly you're hiding the actual number and secondly the cubes are so light that they regularly migrate off the correct values with slight knocks of the player board. And finally, make sure you have the updated rulebook because the original one is painfully bad. Based on 1 play.

Very fun. Like a choose your own adventure novel in board game form. This is one of the rare paragraph-driven games like Tales of the Arabian Nights. It's got much better gameplay than TotAN, but while the stories in SMERSH are good, they're not as completely insane as the ones from TotAN. This is a pretty worthy addition to any collection, and if you like TotAN and wished it had a clearer objective than "just have fun until someone gets 20 points", then this is the game you've been waiting for.

My opinion is based on two back to back plays of the game.  It just doesn't seem very good.  I enjoy Tales of the Arabian Nights, but Agents of Smersh seems to somehow miss all of what I enjoy about that other game.   AoS doesn't seem to have the sense of a character story arc that TotAN always seems to provide, win or lose.  Also, I am skeptical that the co-op format really works for this type of game.  Random stuff happens, and then you either lose or beat the game.  In TotAN, you move through the story and have a sense of progression regardless of how your encounters are turning out.  The Book of Encounters also feels very tacked on.  You make your reaction choice before you even hear any story, making the whole thing seem rather pointless both mechanically and from a storytelling standpoint.

Maybe we were doing something wrong, but my impression is that the game is flawed.  The mechanisms seem unbalanced and fail to support the storytelling aspects.  TotAN's place is secure.

UPDATE: OK, I was playing it wrong.  You can't try to immediately chase down the Intel like Gates in Arkham Horror or infection cubes in Pandemic.  You can take your time and built up your skills first.  But, barring an unlucky series of encounters, you can take as much time as you need, to the point that the endgame may not be much of a challenge.  I'm still not crazy about the experience this game provides.

A nice game in the same vein as Tales of Arabian Nights with a choose-your-own-adventure feel.  You play as a secret agent completing missions in an attempt to thwart a mad scientist.  Over the course of the game you will deal with henchmen, femme fatales, and more as you gain spy gear and complete missions.  Complete the correct amount of missions and you win.  Fail and the mad scientist gets closer and closer to world domination.

I really enjoy storytelling games. Agents of SMERSH brings a co-operative element to this that everyone I've shared it with seems to enjoy. Amassing clues and taking down henchmen ties with the best of sensational spy stories.

Many of the encounters are cheesy. It's partly the theme but it may distract or bother some. The blind dice draws means early success can feel random. A few early losses can really set players back as clue requirements become more difficult.

I really enjoy this game. Anyone who is even slightly in favour of storytelling games should try it as well.

So much fun to be had if you bring the right mindset to the table. This is not a terribly strategic game, so not the right game for hard-core gamers or Euro gamers.

Like Tales Of The Arabian Nights, this is a game of stories and having ridiculous adventures that don’t really add up to a cohesive arc. That’s not to say you can’t still enjoy the hilarity and inanity.

Our group has a great time hearing the stories and revelling in the successful dice rolls.

We need to play with the Showdown! expansion, though, as I’ve read that improves the end game. Plus, I’m more than interested in trying the campaign game.

Been trying to get this to hit the table but have only managed to play it solo so far.  Great theme (70's Cold War exaggerated spy genre) and the storybook element, though very similar to Choose Your Own Adventure books, is fun.  Reminds me of Tales of the Arabian Nights but you have slightly more control over getting your ass kicked in this one.

We like a good co-op game but one of the fundamentals of good co-op games it that they are hard. Unfortunately this one fell a little flat as we breezed through to a victory fairly easily. 

I like the story telling aspects, and I really like the dual nature of the cards. The poker encounters are interesting. There is a huge amount of replayability here as that story book is huge, as are the piles of status cards, and top secret cards etc.  

The die roll mechanic is interesting and unique whereby you pull random dice which all have differing numbers of success on them from a blind bag and then roll them, however resolution is very very simple, did I roll 1 or 2 success from however many die I rolled. Failures on dice actually do nothing.

I will happily play again but I think I prefer [thing=34119][/thing] to this, although there feels like there is more of a game here.

A game that uses some of the same mechanisms as Tales of the Arabian Nights. Unfortunately the stories are just less interesting, I think it just misses the absurdity which makes Tales so much fun. This game does give you more of a goal than Tales, but I think that too works in it disadvantage as the fun in Tales is in making your own story and deciding where to go based on that. It is definitely not a bad game and I enjoy playing it, but I'd just rather be playing Tales.

[i]Feb 2013[/i]: I have mixed feelings about this game. I  really would like to like this game as I enjoy the spy-fi action genre, . The narrative element scratches the RPG itch, hence another mark in the game's favor.
The game play is reminiscent of Arkham Horror.
Randomness doesn't usually bother me, but the forced changes in location were annoying. The End of Turn flavour text didn't match the intel changes and the airport closings.

It's a really cool cooperative game with a solo variant as well. Your objective is to take out Dr. Lobo by hunting down his henchmen. You do this by traveling all over the world hunting intelligence and figuring out where these henchmen are. As the game progresses, the squeeze gets put on you by hampering your ability to travel because the airports begin closing. Before you know it Dr. Lobo is getting pretty smart and you'll need even more Intel to take him out. Don't be fooled just because you have a pile of Intel like I did on my first game. I got stomped by a Double-Agent! There's a lot more to this game than I wish to describe here, but one of the funnest parts is the 1,600 small encounters you may find yourself in (provided you have the book of encounters). Some encounters can be pretty funny. The rules were OK, but I found myself continuously digging through them or searching for answers online. There are some oddball errors on the board and cards (although trivial for the most part). However, despite these things the game is quite fun and for me was very much worth getting.

I love storytelling and I wanted to like this game so much. I just felt it was way too fiddly, but most of all the rules that came with the game were so bad that it killed any enjoyment we might have had. 

Edit 7/20/15: Tried the game again and thanks to the new 2.0 rules my opinion has went from a sad 5 to a much more acceptable 7. I think the game is fun, but a few things lost it points for me and made it a game I would not mind playing (I would have fun), but probably will never own. Some things that bothered me included: game length, space required, component overload (made it a little fiddly), lots of random, and I could never see playing it with more than 2. Also passing the encounter book back and fourth + flipping through it is cumbersome and slows the game down. I know there is now an app, but it should be included in the game and not as a $5 add-on imho.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about it so far. The gameplay is fun, but I question some of the mechanics. For example, unlike pretty much every coop in existence, bad things don't happen every turn. In fact, at the end of each turn usually MORE intel comes on the board, helping you out. And you aren't really penalized in any way I can see for resting to remove your wounds, which again doesn't make much sense to me.
But the encounters themselves are fun so far. I'm just not sure if the game will have the longevity for me to hang onto it.

Soloed [thing=111105][/thing] twice, once with agent Dante Wright (I failed a few tests, faced Lobo without much intel, and ended up losing by one icon), and once with agent Calli Dagger (went much more smoothly, got loads of intel then rushed to the final showdown, but still only [i]just[/i] won). I enjoy the stories in [thing=34119][/thing] more, but I enjoy this more as a game - your moves and choices seem to have a bit more purpose, the outcomes of the encounters are a bit more predictably linked to your advanced skills, the plentiful successes feel satisfying, and the occasional losses are painful but not usually annoying. Definitely want to play again, even if I end up not keeping it.

After 18 months of steady play, during which time I tweaked to find the right balance in difficulty, I've paused to boost my rating. One of my highest scores ever. It overflows with theme and variety, and I like the use of individual skills. The revised rules help, but still come up a little short; even with the geeks' helpful videos you may have to figure out some of it as you go. I've seen some complaints about the amount of chance, but I don't see more than in other strong co-ops.
It does require a lot of space, and you may have to do a little searching in the Book of Encounters, which isn't in strict order. 
You may also want to think about whether all the Status cards add enough to be worth keeping track of. I'm down to about to about two-thirds of the deck.

Poor attempt at immitating Tales of Arabian night and Eldritch / Arkham Horror.

The version with the book is poorer, because the choices you take have most of the time no sense. You see this in Rahdo's videos quite frequently. Your character is supposed to tel a joke, but there is nothing mentioning a joke in the paragraph, or about a bomb, but there is no bomb, etc. 

Tales of Arabian nights and Arkham or Eldritch Horror are much better game. Smersh is a botched game, I think they've spent so much time on writing, they forgot what each paragraph was for. lol

Don't buy this unless you really know what you are buying.

A little bit more to it than Tales of the Arabian Nights, but still not as much "game" as I would have hoped.  A great experience, no doubt, and the encounter writing is solid, but I feel like I would want there to be one or two more mechanics to the game, or some more choices during the encounters.  If the system of this game were a little more like Pandemic or Defenders of the Realm or Ghost Stories, with more cooperative decision-making and more interaction between the characters and players, and you ALSO had the paragraph encounter book thing, then that would really be something amazing.

First of all, this game quite possibly has the worst rulebook I've ever read for a game. And I've read hundreds and hundreds of rulebooks, many of them written and/or translated by people who don't speak English as a first language... Completely unforgivable.

That said, the game can be some fun. You have a little more control over things than Arabian Knights, which is a plus. Somehow the spy theme lends itself to a series of unconnected weird little adventures, so the narrative (such as it is) kind of works. At the end of the day, though, there's not much here--other than the pain of the non-existent copy editing.

If you think this game is similar to Tales of the Arabian Nights, then you are correct.

However, the design of this game is a lot more solid, and your choices have more of an impact. Additionally, you're working together which means you're doing more than playing multiplayer solitaire.

After playing it once I bought it on the spot. The second play through was even more fun than the first.

The rulebook is a bit tricky, but the guides online, or a reading it twice, should be enough to overcome any rule questions.

It's impossible to not compare this to Arabian Nights, so I won't attempt to do so.

It's not as good.

Here's why: in Arabian Nights, the win/lose conditions and the mini-quests are a pretext to open-ended adventure. You have very little influence over your position on the tracks, and so in the end, "winning" is only a signal to stop playing. Then you take stock of the wild ride that each character has been on, and it's a blast. The mechanics are very thin, so the focus is squarely on the paragraphs, at is should be.

SMERSH takes a very similar level of randomness in situation resolution, but adds more levels of gameplay beneath it. But since it's a co-op, the game is necessarily difficult to overcome. So what you have is a game that most often tells a story of how a team of the greatest spies the world has to offer were defeated by terrible evil. For a game that rises and falls on its narrative, this is not a satisfying experience.

To make matters worse, the book's entries are not very well written. They're populated by endless streams of cliche tropes, but that's not the problem; it's more distracting that there are basic editing issues like misuse of apostrophes and grammatical errors. These errors serve to pull me out of the story when I should be immersed.

That said, it's still a fun game. I'm happy to have both SMERSH and Arabian Nights on my shelf, but if you want one or the other, Arabian Nights is the way to go.

I like how you are given just a nugget of what the encounter could be and you have to decide how your agent will react....unfortunately, sometimes the encounter doesn't end up anything like you were led to believe.  The end game isn't particularly satisfying; I think that was addressed in an expansion, but I haven't tried it.

I really enjoyed playing Agents of SMERSH as it really gets me immersed in that 70s fantasy Cold War/James Bond-esque genre. I have played this game several times solo and once with a friend. 

But there are a few downsides. First, the set-up needs a lot of table space (which I hope the Android app would address).  Getting to the encounter is a little cumbersome, but is offset by the encounter itself. The rulebook is a little confusing to use and so I use the compact rules download (available at BGG) as that is more clearly written. If not for these, I would have given a full 10.

For me, the faults do not overshadow the enjoyment of playing the game and I would play it again if schedule allows.

Man this is a fun game. Or should I say 'game'. We played the ending conditions wrong, mostly because the rulebook is probably the worst non-prototype rulebook I have ever read. Someone on the geek has made a condensed rules sheet pdf, get that and your experience will go much more smoothly. However, that did not detract from the experience of playing the game, since it all hangs on the...SUPERB!!! encounters in the encounter book. This is ToAN version 2.0. We laughed and laughed and laughed. So who cares if the rulebook doesnt really explain how the game ends properly :D

Very enjoyable, very thematic and works well as a coop. However, if you didn't like Tales of the Arabian Nights then this isn't for you because the core mechanic is exactly the same - go to a paragraph, set the theme, roll a die or dice and take the usually very random consequences.

Personally, I love these games when they are put together as well as this, even though the game is playing you. Winning or losing is completely immaterial.

RATING: 3
[b]First Impressions:[/b] First, I'll start off by saying I enjoyed this game. Clearly inspired by Tales of the Arabian Nights, The writing in the book is fun, but it feels more of a game than what it draws inspiration from. First a contrast and comparison, then a critique.

Like TofAN, AoS has a big book of encounters that is read out loud to you by another player. But a few of the differences is that with TotAN, the story is about you. And, if you have talented storytellers with you, your story unfolds in a chaotic but congruent manner. There is a large, magical world around you, but the story is about [i]you[/i]. In AoS, it feels as if you are only a part of a story. You aren't James Bond, but you are an agent in MI6. I don't know if it's because of the cooperative mechanics, the theme, or the writing. Perhaps it is due to the mechanical nature of making choices for the sake of successes, and not for your character.

But, just in the same way as TofAN, making choices for the sake of successes is a total crapshoot. When you have an encounter, you are given name of the encounter, almost like a title of a movie scene. You are then given a matrix of choices. Your character has skills (and Advanced skills), and you try and make a choice that would best match your skills, but you really have no idea how the writers intended something to be interpreted and you have no idea how applicable your choice and skills are to the situation. For an example, you may have Driving/Piloting skills, and an encounter regarding a car chase comes up. You pick your choice, thinking "Oh. I totally got this one..." and as the story unfolds and you end up stealing a kid's bicycle to chase down the henchmen in a red Lamborghini. Now you have to try and pass an athletics skill check, but by this time, you've already made your choice, and your agent's physique makes Barney Gumble look like Usain Bolt. And because your driving skill doesn't matter for the muscle coordination of peddling a bike between alleyways and garbage trucks, you failed the encounter, got injured from hyper extension, and the evil Dr. Lobos got closer to finishing his sinister plans. But there was no way you could have predicted the game would have put you on a bike and not a sports car.

But it should be said that the writing of the game can be very, very funny. There was one time another player decided to "Trust their instincts" and they tried to pull the mask off the villain that was disguised as the agency's director. Instead, they dug their fingers into the director's neck and almost got fired. In TotAN, the situations are just funny. The choices are funny. The story arc and chaos is funny. But in AoS, the writing is funny. You either pull off the most over-the-top stunts, or hilariously fail.

I found that there was enough variety in the encounters through one play and three players, that every encounter was fun and unique. But in TotAN, you'll reference the same encounters a few times in a game. And that always held an immersion breaking cloud over the game when it happens. As going into a cave and encountering a genie bound in shackles twice in a game just wasn't flavorful enough, especially if you remember the results the first time.

But one thing TofAN does have over AoS is quality. The quality of writing is almost masterful and the complete stories are stupendous. The components are solid, well printed, and shine. The rulebook is concise and easy to reference. Aos has decent print, but almost all of the components lacked quality or consistency in some way. The main board is blindingly glossy and didn't sit flat, the player boards are flimsy and prone to curl and bend (Which is a huge problem for placing markers). The wood cubes have some knotty defects and one of the decks had a course and uncomfortable feel compared to the other cards. The insert is about 1/8 off from being useful (Which would help with the bending mats components). The rulebook was disorganized and difficult to reference, with some inconsistencies with the final print (The cards have similar problems too). In three players, we essentially had it so the current player held the reaction matrix, another player read the encounter, and the other player was busy trying to reference rule clarifications. For a game with a short book, it was difficult to find answers.

While in TotAN, the game is almost non-existent and lacks any serious depth, in AoS, there is a fair bit of fiddlyness. Some of this is due to the rulebook and component quality, but I feel a couple things could be more elegant and streamlined.

Still, despite the [i]many[/i] faults, I still generally enjoyed the game, and I will have a difficult time figuring out if I want to keep both TotAN and AoS.

RATING: 7
What is a pretty ordinary save-the-world co-op game is transformed by the theme and the card text. The game is pretty similar to Pandemic. Run across the world and make some rolls to see if you succeed. But I really enjoy the cheesy agent spy references. Very cool.

I just wish there was more cards, especially villain cards because I can see the replayability wearing thin over multiple plays.

[Book of Encounters 4/10]
Playing with and without the Book, I was surprised to find that the book weakened the game. Firstly, unlike Arabian Nights, the wording on the cards was so poor. "Pursuit"? "Vendetta"? Who am I pursuing? Am I being pursued? You pick an action with such limited information. It almost seems unnecessary. I would have preferred more cards instead of the book.

Terrible rule system, even worse rulebook. No sense of direction on most turns. The encounters are decision-less gameplay obscured by three layers of randomness. Even the end game is totally random: we have 14 intel tokens, and we need 5! Oh no, we lost, we're missing a walkie talkie, WHICH WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IF WE HAD OR HOW TO GET. 

"But Jon, this is a story telling game". A game is 2 hours of reading the equivalent of 20 pages, and the content is of "so bad it's hilarious" level.

It is said that Munchkin is a good 30 minute game that lasts 90. This is a bad 30 minute game that lasts 120.

I think this game is brilliant.  Though I don't care much for the agents that come with the base box, the Kickstarter exclusive agents are great.  You must have the right mindset to properly enjoy this game, however.  As a whole, this is more of a choose-your-own-adventure experience rather than a game composed of intricately crafted mechanics.  For best results, flip on the James Bond Pandora radio station and send your agent around the world to see what spytastic adventures await them.

I own the Kickstarter edition (2nd edition) with all the trimmings, including the tiny Dr. Lobo bust.  heh.  I think this one is better than Tales of the Arabian Nights, if you ask me.  It is more of a game than Arabian Nights, but is still full of luck; it is a blast if you dig storytelling games.  I also dig the 70s Cold War spy theme.  :-)  I should also note that I like Tales of the Arabian Nights, I just dig this game more.  :-)

I assumed this was a weak, reskinned sequel to Arabian Nights, while playing, and was surprised to find it was an unauthorised clone. SMERSH puts even more focus on the frustrating "pick a verb you think matches your character strengths, then see whether the book agrees or arbitrarily doesn't" of Nights, and because this is a co-op game played against the book, it just makes you resent the book even more. Despite the potential of the genre, the bland ability cards make it much harder to find a player narrative than in Nights.

I really liked this game (even though yes, we did lose).  I think it takes two OK games (in my opinion) and turns them into one great game.  It is a bit like Pandemic in that you are running around the world responding to various events and working together.  But unlike Pandemic the theme isn't just pasted on: in other words, it is just more fun.

It is obviously a bit like Tales of the Arabian Nights because it is a storytelling game and there aren't many of them yet (but I'm guessing we'll be seeing more in the future).  But this game I feel like there is much more strategy and control over what you do, and I just like the theme better.  Also, I love the custom dice, and compared to Arabian Nights the dice actually reduce randomness because you can choose to add extra dice to your roll (for example).

Great game, I enjoyed playing it!

Thematic James Bond spy stereotype story game. Become one of several different UN Agents to attempt to stop Dr. Lobo and his schemes. Players go around the map having encounters and gaining bonuses/taking injuries and other negatives along the way. I have a couple of big gripes: 1st it's possible to lose the game simply by not having the necessary intel at the end when you encounter Dr. Lobo. Intel are random things that you gain through encounters/picking up on the map; 2nd, Everything can go crazy in the matter of minutes. Overall good fun and something I would play again. Encounter book a MUST!

I like this game.  It reminds me a lot of tales of arabian nights, but with more focus.  One of the points that my son made was that tales is rough when you get put into prison and have to just watch the game happen.  That does not happen in SMERSH.  It moves along pretty quickly, though I would like more use of the book for variety.

A STORYTELLING BOARD GAME SET IN THE 1970s COLD WAR ERA.

Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. The game will be able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book that contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix to Tales of the Arabian Nights - or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters, and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game. There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor.

(KS)  A fun cooperative game to play.  You are agents trying to foil the evil plots of Dr. Lobo and his henchmen.  As you travel around the world looking for clues as to Dr Lobo's whereabouts it gets harder and harder to unravel the plots.  However, with good team work and a bit of lady luck on your side with some dice rolls you shall prevail and stop Dr Lobo in his tracks.  The Destiny book is a must have for this game it contains 1600 unique outcomes that are predicated by dice and cards and a players choice of their agents adventures.

I enjoy TotAN more than this one (but part of that may just be my preference of theme) but this game does play much faster, particularly with four or five.  The story line feels a bit more disjointed than TotAN but is still quite an adventure and is quite humorous at times.  The use of the dice for checks is a nice touch to add in some uncertainty...and some cussing at times when the dice don't go your way.

I had high hopes that this would match, or even come close to the experience of playing Tales from the Arabian Nights due to the more interesting theme. Sadly this isn't the case. The experience was rather forgettable, and really wasn't worth the price I paid for the game. The components are definitely not worth the price. For now I will be keeping Tales of the Arabian Nights, but I will always be on the lookout for a better storytelling boardgame.

The star of this game is the encounter book with 1600 detailed encounter descriptions and skill checks.  We had a lot of fun reading these aloud.  The game is very random.  Even in a well played game, you may get unlucky and be missing one of the required Intel tokens.  I like the artwork.  You definitely need to download the corrected rules from BGG as they are a mess in the box copy.  It is very much like Fortune & Glory with seemingly unlimited unique encounters.

Fun game, gave us plenty of laughs at first but grew tired of it. Not really as much cooperation as we expected as each player is doing their own thing with no opportunity to share stuff between players.  Plus the game time is just too long for the type of game. Fun theme, good story-telling, mediocre gameplay. There are plenty of other games we'd rather play before this.

I like Tales of the Arabian Nights a lot. The main problem with this game is that the action you pick makes no sense, and it's very disconnected with the paragraph you end up reading.

Overall it seemed very, very random, with very few interesting decisions, and not much state carrying on throughout the game. So it felt less like one big adventure, and more like a bunch of little, unconnected ones.

RATING: 8
If you've ever played Arabian Nights, you ALMOST know what to expect. However, there are far more decision points; in fact there are actually some, enough so that this feels like a game rather than just an experience.

The WW2 era spy theme oozes throughout, the stories are captivating, and you don't even care whether you win or lose, it's just that fun.

This game is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  We love Tales of the Arabian Nights but it doesn't play like a game as much as just a story building engine.

Our first play was a loss and it didn't matter.  It was still an amazing experience.  I can't wait to play this one with the family and get a game with 4 or 5 players.  LOVE IT!!

Acquired 8/2013. I bought the (first edition) base game when I Kickstarted the expansion, "Swagman's Hope"... how can you not buy a game with an expansion titled "Swagman's Hope"? That more than makes up for the oddball title of the base game, which, if I'd known "Dr. Lobo" was a nickname for Dr. Lobotomy, I'd have bought without waiting for an expansion.

Admittedly, it took us two years to get this game to the table. I now realize that's two years of hilarious fun wasted! SMERSH is an immersive story-telling game about high-profile spies. Very James Bond! Very seventies! But if you are in your fifties and like storytelling games, you will love the atmosphere and humor of SMERSH.

Make sure to start with the updated rulebook though. That first one was simple, but too choppy to get a good feel of how the game is supposed to flow. Better yet, get the app. You'll save tons of time.

I can say that Swagman's Hope made it to the table in under a week. (We are lucky if we get to play games twice a week.) Swagman's Hope is very difficult to beat though. I've purchased the promo box and the the showdown book because this game will be seeing a fair amount of play at our house.

Recommend! (You know, if you liked [or lived through] the seventies.)

RATING: 8
Its book of encounters reminds me of the old fashioned book-RPGs I used to play when I was a child. I'm sure I am going to find it a lot of fun just because of that. The theme is very nice too!

Update: played a solo game with the book of encounters. It is very luck-based, but using the book keeps the luck a little at bay, as you can at least try to choose a reaction that best fits your character.

It is a very thematic game, which is a HUGE plus. On the con side, the amount of luck involved can be a bit frustrating.

For example: on my first solo play, Dr. Lobo has gone to level 7, in which I needed 6 intels to defeat him. I found his location with about 15 intel, but I had NO DOUBLE AGENTS AT ALL and lost the game because of that. I had a lot of fun playing the game, but if someone in my gaming group got a bit frustrated because of this defeat, I would understand.

Update: rate lowered a bit as I played twice more and found the game to be quite easy. I'm definitely going to apply the harder game rules on my next plays.

This is a lot of fun as a thematic and challenging solo experience. Going to play it co-op in the next couple of weeks (and more solo) before adding a few comments and scoring. But even at this stage, with all expansions and particularly the app for encounters - it's a thrilling (solo) ride.

Or a high 6 if I'm in a generous mood. It takes SO LONG for what is basically a left-or-right kind of decision. Suck at Spycraft? Pick the "choice" that sounds the most combative, or vice versa, or whatever. Also, the accumulation of "advanced skills" make the encounters both more and less predictable, in that the electronic skill you've been sitting on all game will somehow give you an insta-win when you sneak into a warehouse or something, or you'll get into a car chase that and your "Diversion" card will give you double the dice for a check. In Arkham, you have the focus mechanic, allowing you to tailor a character towards one end on a spectrum of skills and play philosophies. It's dynamic. Here, not only is your success rate on a given task dictated by a dice roll that you might pass just because, but your probability of a given dice dice pool is provided through another layer or randomness. Also cueing the end-game and still having the possibility to lose is kind of absurd. It hasn't even happened to me and I find it stupid.

The humor and storytelling make this one a lot of fun.  Lately the theme has been a bit of a turn-off, but it should rebound.

RATING: 5
Cool theme. Cool content. Boring game. There are few meaningful choices to be made. Easy encounter or hard encounter? This direction or that direction? Your skill test "choices" are not really choices at all. You just choose the one with the highest probability of success, so the choice is not really a choice at all. The encounters, while sometimes funny, don't create a good narrative because there is no cohesion to what happens. One turn you are on a train. The next you are on a boat. The next you are running from ninjas. The next you are at a bar meeting a girl. The next one you are kidnapped and on an island. Each one individually is cute and themey, but they are, in the end, just random text that is punctuated by a die roll for succeed or fail, or, worse, an auto-pass because you are lucky enough to have the proper skill token (which, in my view, actually takes AWAY from the fun of the game since you don't even have to do anything to pass the encounter). I didn't go into this game expecting it to be Caylus, but I did want more strategy and interactivity than this gave me. In the end, I'd rather just watch a Bond movie.

Overall, great fun!

Got a chance to demo this game at GenCon 2012.  I liked it a lot, and it was fun.  I'm just not sure that a cooperative storytelling game would work with the crowd of people I play games with???

Got the game, really good story telling and fun.  Can be tough, and depends on some luck.  Just like watching a James Bond flick.  Like it quite a bit.  Make sure you download the version 2.0 rules from the files section to save yourself some grief, along with the excellent "Clarified Rules and FAQ" uploaded by WhereAreTheBlackDice.

A neat storytelling game with an unique theme. Not quite as polished as it should be though. While it certainly does have more game in the box than Tales of the Arabian Nights, that game isn't necessarily good. The book of tales really helps hold the whole thing together, and anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about. Plus it lacks any kind of climactic finish at all. You run around the world dealing with henchmen while trying to gather clues, and at some point it's just assumed that you defeated Dr. Lobo. I got rid of this before the expansion that includes the showdown, but again, the design behind SMERSH isn't anything to write home about.

Would rather play Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Yet another cooperative game that involves people moving around the map and drawing cards to see what "bad stuff" happens to them.  Regardless, I actually enjoyed my play of this solitaire and will definitely give it a few more plays.  After a few more plays I just did not care for it.  Sold.

Seems like when you failed, it had really big impact in the advancement of evil.  When you played well and passed, evil still moved forward and felt like the agents were only doing damage control instead of making a difference you were just holding water back with your hands instead of making a dam.

The life of a spy! If you are a fan of Tales of the Arabian Nights, then this game will not disappoint. The main difference between the two games is that in AoS you are trying to ultimately defeat Dr. Lobo and his henchmen. In Tales you are basically wandering the world having adventures along the way. 

I have to say this game is really hard to beat. Others have said it has been easy to win, I just wonder if maybe they have some of the rules wrong. So far, out of four games we have only won once. Possibly it is more difficult to win a 2 player game...not sure, needs more plays.

The board and components are nice quality. The cards are a bit thin and need card sleeves. The round skill tokens are difficult to find and read when you need them...due to their circular text. I miss the fact that you cannot make your skills into a master skill (which was possible in Tales). But the ability to increase your stats on your character sheet and use resolve probably make up for that. I do wish each person had the list of story choices on their own player mats, instead of one card for everyone. This is really one of the nicest features in Tales of the Arabian Nights, that I truly miss in this game. Also, there is quite a bit of wasted empty board space...it would have been nice to have a place for a couple of the decks at least.

Some mechanics that are really great to the game are the closing of the airports. I also really like the intel collection box. The upgrading of stats on your character sheet as you gain experience in the game and the use of resolve are great thematic aspects of the game too.

RATING: 7
A co-op reminiscent of Tales Of The Arabian Nights, but set in the Cold-War, aiming to collect enough stuff to beat the big boss. Move somewhere, decide your action, cross-ref a couple of things based on your location and how you want to approach the test (usually aiming to match with with the advanced skills you already have), look up the paragraph and pass whatever dice-rolling test it provides. The more passes you get, the better your skills get, the more dice you'll roll, the more likely you are to pass future tests. Start failing from the start and you start losing skills, lose dice, and the slippery slope starts. Then reveal a random card which puts out tokens, and you want to get to, and then claim these tokens to win in the end. So it's a total luck-fest, but it's about the ride - you need to be able to read those paragraphs with verve and vigour and bring some zip to the game yourself - it's all about the story your character generates along the way. So, it's good for role-players, otherwise it's just a dull dice-rolling affair for dedicated Euro-gamers. There's not much co-op there in terms of tension or joint decisions to be made - it's very much a multi-solo adventure game. But, I give it an extra point for the amazing lengths gone to with the paragraph book and the ability to provide immersion for those who seek it.

RATING: 7
"Story-telling co-op with fun retro spy theme. Longer than I would like, and I really dislike that the final showdown is (by design) a crapshoot where you win or lose based on some chit draws."

What I like:
- Fun theme, and the stories are entertaining (the book is a must)
- Pretty board, and generally nice components

What I don't like:
- The 1st edition rules are horrible. Download the revised version.
- The final showdown is a crapshoot. For a game this long, that feels wrong. 
- Can run long (our 4p learning game was 3.5 hours)
- Storytelling isn't my favorite mechanism

RATING: 5
The paragraphs read to advance the "plot" are weak, often creating a scene "in medias res" that makes little sense.  There is nothing compelling about the various situations nor about the choices you make as a character.  I found myself zoning out on the narratives and just paying attention to the parameters of the skill tests.

Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative story-telling game in the same vein as Tales of the Arabian Nights.  This is definitely a lot more of a game than Arabian Nights, as you have more choices, the choices seem to matter more, and the goals of the game are more concrete.  The game working against you puts a pressure on the players that isn't there in the more ponderous Arabian Nights.  I think it all fits together pretty well, and I'm glad other people are taking up the challenge of doing the enormous amount of writing required for a game like this.

There are obvious comparisons to Tales of the Arabian Nights, but this is the game I wanted Arkham Horror to be.

Really fun story-based co-operative adventure game. High randomness which may bother some people, particularly in the end game.

The spy theme is fresh and executed very well. The different agents play similarly enough that it makes the game easy to teach, but each has their own advantages which makes every player feel like a valuable member of the team.

I have only played with 4 players so far, but the pacing of the game prevented anyone from having a 'nothing turn'.

RATING: 6
Very similar to Arabian Nights. On your turn, you get a cryptic message like "On A Boat", and you choose an interaction like "Cheat" or "Escape" or "Laugh".  You index these things into a giant storybook, and you get a little story about the secret agent things your character is doing, and then you roll the dice to see if you did well.

The key difference from Arabian Nights is that this game is cooperative.

This wasn't a bad game but it was a very low-strategy game.

I actually like the encounters, but there is so much of this that is to luck that it just drags it down. The flavor text is a lot of fun and if there was a different way that didn't make you fly through the deck of fate cards so fast to figure out your encounter, it may have been less like work and more fun. I don't mind luck but any chance of using strategy at all in this game is thrown out the window by the massive amounts of decks of cards AND dice. Way too much going on here to even think about having fun while playing this game.

I can share the initial sentiment that the encounter narratives don't seem coherent as you play the game, but I've since viewed that: a) the countries represent parts of a book/movie; b) the encounter card titles are chapter headings and c) it is part of the game to try and piece together the paragraphs into a coherent whole.
This orientation made the ride less jolting, and I see some of nods to some spy flicks e.g. Bourne Identity :-)

So far I'm enjoying the adventure, as some of the success involves making logical choice of action relative to your skill level and advance skill capabilities.

Fun storytelling romp with a very strong secret agent theme.  Lovelovelove the Book of Encounters.
That said, it is the nature of these sort of games that the player decisions -- as far as adventure responses -- have little to no strategic value, and that randomly choosing is as good as selectively picking.  I would prefer more control than that.

I judge games based on what they were designed to do.  Some games are grognard types and others are Toys R Us types, while others are somewhere in between.  Just because is lighter doesn't make it bad and just because a game is a deep strategy type doesn't make it good.

Agents of Smersh is a lighter type of game but hits the nail on the head.  It is very fun for the family and accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Which is give a feel for being a spy.  

The Encounter books (I have the Swagman's expansion) adds the atmosphere greatly.  If you like this role playing type of game, you will love this game. 

I found the quality of components very good, the interaction between players very good, the concept excellent.  

As I was thinking about what I don't like about the game the only thing is the manual.  It gets you right in the game without any pre information of what you have.  This is very confusing because you don't know what the heck you are doing and with what.  Thank God for the videos at boardgame geek to actually teach the game because the manual sucks at that.  That is why it only gets a 9.  The authors ought to take a lesson from Fantasy Flight manuals on how to write one.  

But once that hurdle was over, again thanks to the videos on boardgame geek, the game was easy to learn, easy to teach, with a good amount of decisions to be made.  The game isn't going to have you going back to the manual very much, so you don't have a lot of modifiers and crap, just simple do this type of playing.

I really enjoyed this type of game and the designers did a great job developing the game and the Encounter books are a work of art.  Now if they could just write a decent manual, they would have the perfect 10.

What an excellent game that suffers for "POOR RULEBOOK" syndrome (v2.0 fixes this)! The files on BGG for the updated rule book and summary sheets made understanding the true mechanics of this game a breeze and allow you to submerse yourself into the wonderfully delightful story that you experience each time! This game should really be in your collection if you are at all a fan of cold-war era spy movies and tv shows. It captures the flavor wonderfully!

SMERSH is the first game I ever Kickstarted, and sort of watched, with baited breath, while it took the long trip from development to my table. I can safely say it's the game I've looked forward to receiving more than any other.

And its one that delivers on it's promise of being a highly thematic, story driven game, with a strong RPG slant and decisions that will actually affect the outcome of your mission. 

To get a sense of the vivid stories that can come out of this well executed design, see my session report here: [url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/899514/a-tale-of-two-spies[/url])

I applaud the efforts and the many details they hung from the design, all in the spirit of further immersion, from status cards, to secret missions, to specialized skills, to reoccurring characters. When I sit to play a game I am looking to get pulled into a different world and that's exactly what this provides.

I really wish I could rate it a solid 9. (Sadly I can't even rate it an 8. After 15+ plays even the revised rulebook continues to be a source of frusteration and a lesson in what [i]not[/i] to do.

But the end result feels rushed. Graphically, it starts to overflow with small design choices and inconsistencies that really manage to distract and annoy, important details feel overlooked. Surprisingly, there are simply too many type-O's in a game that feeds off language and clean writing. 
The rulebook is at this point, a well documented train wreck. Fortunately the game is pretty easy to grasp and dive right into. 

There is also a fantastic, user-made reference available here: [url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80799/clarified-rules-and-faq[/url]

It feels to me like the designer knew he had created a special game, that the engine was solid and humming, and he just became too eager to get it out to us.

Every time I run into one of it's many blemishes it yanks me right out of the world I'm playing in, and leaves me wishing that he had run the old, fine-toothed-comb over everything a few more times before letting it out the door. 

The other minor (and far more subjective) quibble would be that I wish the encounters were a bit darker and more serious, less Get Smart and more Daniel Craig's 007.

Either way, I have thoroughly enjoyed every single game I've played and this will sit right at the top of my, games-to-play pile, for a long time.. and ultimately, that's the truest test of a games quality that I can think of.

There is some luck you have to mitigate but it is well designed, fun, and has a reasonable play length.  Now I will be playing this with the expansion!

Honestly, this game should lose a few points for the rulebook alone, especially if you are using the Book of Encounters. It's a mess trying to figure out the exact flow of the game.

Now, with that complaint out of the way-
This is still probably the best story-telling game on the market. There's enough of a game under the theme to give players a real sense of choice and accomplishment. I especially love all the different skills and status upgrades. It's easy to really flesh out your agent over the course of the game.

Overall:
Once you work through the kinks in the rulebook, there's a real gem to be found in Agents of SMERSH. I figured this would be more of a niche game but I can see myself playing this on any number of occasions. Lots of fun!

This game for me is just fun to play. It always weaves a story and most of the games I have played have just the right amount of tension with us winning about 50% of the time. But win or lose, for me it is some of those iconic spy moments that come out of the game and has us all smiling and remembering the experience. I am sure it is not for everyone, but those that like a good coop, enjoy the campy days of spies (the 60s) like Our Man Flint or even the Man from U.N.C.L.E. with a little James Bond mixed in should enjoy Agents of SMERSH.

Very entertaining mix of coop and story-telling game. From a pure gameplay perspective it might be inferior to classic coops as Pandemic, but the story part makes AoSMERSH stand out from the coop crowd. In every player's turn you have one little episode (like tailing a suspect and then engage in a fist fight). So the story is a line of rather independent little plots and not one big story line.

This game has it moment sof great story telling and works well if that is what you are looking for in solo game.  I enjoy the fact that the abilities and skills can make real impact with your decisions.  This is not always the case with games of this genera.  However, there is still a heavy lucky factor so the game should not be taken too seriously and thought of as a story game.  Good game if theme and story is what yu looking for no matter what happens.

This is a game that put a story in the box and makes a game out of it. This game will be compared Tales of Arabian Nights(TOAN). Is it better??? Well at the same time of being able to compare these games I don't think you can compare them because of how different they play. TOAN has better adventure story's but Agents has a more live game. What I mean by that is Agents you are trying to catch the main bad guy and you are working together to do so. Also you care more about winning and beating the game.And TOAN you are just enjoying the adventure and seeing all the stupid things that can happen to you before you trip is over and you don't really care if you lose but is more exciting if you win and tons of crazy things happen to you.

RATING: 7
06-09-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Ashes, Ashes, where did we go wrong? I preordered this game from Plaidhat because I was super that it couldn't go wrong. I love Magic.. this seemed similar. I like dice, Ashes has dice.. 

In Ashes, you take a deck of cards and try to kill the other Phoenixborn. Each turn, you roll 10 dice. You use those dice to subsequently fuel abilities and cards from a Phoenixborn, some kind of MtG Planeswalker. You cast spells 'as' that Phoenixborn, with which you try to stay alive and kill your opponent. Fun twist is the spellboard system, which is a set of cards that you play in front of you, which allow you to produce conjurations. Creatures that are instantly replaceable if so desired.. and the focus mechanism.

Regardless, ultimately Ashes fell largely flat for me. I am not sure if that's because I still REALLY like Magic, or that Ashes just felt a little too derivative. I never ever felt that I was playing an interesting game. The decisions were very Magic-y, but the cards are not exciting. All effect-sizes are small, the cards are expensive and the game just allows you to do two things on your turn so it never becomes chained, combo, or something that can cascade to overwhelm. It just was very.. lackluster for me. And I am very sad to say that.

After getting beat by Dr. Lobo every time I played it for the first half a dozen times or so, defeating the evil villain with my game group gave us all a sense of accomplishment.  It's fun to read the passages from the book with accents appropriate to the characters and the game looks great, but do our action "choices" really matter in this players-vs-game system?  I'm not entirely convinced, but it's still a hoot!  This is more fun than it is a good "game."

This is the most immersive game I've ever played.  It draws you right into the world of secret agents.  The gameplay is superb!

Note: The gameplay ISN'T hard. However, the rulebook frankly sucks. One entire deck of cards isn't explained in the main rules at all, and isn't addressed in the FAQ. No. It is explained as a footnote at the end of the Appendix. After the list of Kickstarter contributors, even, which has nothing to do with how to play the game. Yes, really. I have never been so disgusted with a rule book! I should take off a point for the truly disorganized, crappy rulebook, but I just can't, because the game is so much fun! 

Read through the rules and play a few rounds by yourself before teaching it to your friends.  It's absolutely worth it.

What shall I say. I initially wanted to back this game on Kickstarter, but had to drop due to money issues. A year later, I buy a retail copy with the Book of Encounters.

The first game? Absolutely a blast! We lost, but had a great time doing so! I can't wait to play again, and again, and again!

We mixed in the encounter cards with the book of encounters cards. That, my friends, equals a huge amount of variety! 

I really just love this game a lot!

RATING: 8
Very impressed with this! It takes the structure of Tales of the Arabian Nights and brings it into the 2010's by adding a co-op mechanism (let's face it, Tales is not that competitive).

It felt a bit easy and I'm not sure why that is. But win or lose I don't care, I just want to have a wild ride with this one. The co-op part THANKFULLY does not get in the way of the ride AT ALL. You'll get to choose what to do with intel and then have an encounter.

I didn't feel the Dr. Lobo Character was very well implemented thematically. He's the big boss but you never "fight" him. You spend the whole game hunting down his lackeys. Also when you would auto-pass an encounter on a skill you had, you didn't get a "special" success, which was kind of a bummer and would have been more fun.

++POSITIVES++
+Really nailed attaching the "Tales" system to a bare bones co-op engine without distracting from the narrative.
+Your story is always outlandish/interesting/funny/fun.
+Plays REALLY smoothly and in a proper time frame for this game (~2 hours)

--NEGATIVES--
-It's all luck, like ALL L-U-C-K
-Not much interesting gameplay
-Playing with a player bothered by the above two points would bring the whole game down
-Endgame is really anti-climatic
-No "reward" for choosing reactions that are tailored to your skill set

RATING: 10
I love this game so much, I bought it twice! 

I've had the first edition for about a year and my only complaint was that I wanted MORE. So I bought the ultimate 2nd edition with all the Kickstarter bonuses, the Showdown scenario book, and the Swagman's Hope expansion. 

What sets this game apart from others I've played is the depth of the theme and how each time you play, it's a different experience based on the agent you choose and the encounters you must overcome. It can be a punishingly difficult game and often times unfair when luck turns against you, but somehow, I just don't mind. 

Strategy and cooperation are still vital to even a chance of success, even if it just amounts to everyone around the table taking into account probability chances from a potential dice throw or delegating certain pieces of intelligence to certain players. A single random tough scenario with brutal consequences can end the game almost immediately, but even in loss, I don't experience the frustration I've felt with other games. 

There's such a playful sense of humor on display here and so many winks and homages to classic spy films and novels, that it's impossible for me to stay mad at this game. There's also a stunning variety and randomness to the game that keeps things unpredictable and exciting whether it's a gambling side game, having your player abducted by aliens (with consequences that resonate for the rest of the game), or a sinister villain that interrupts your encounter with another henchman. As one of my friends put it, "When they were designing this game, there weren't any rejected ideas. They just put them all in."

If you're a fan of the spy/secret agent genre, I seriously don't know of a better game to have in your collection. It captures the spirit and the fun of vintage Bond, Mission Impossible, Get Smart, and its ilk while perpetuating its own sense of individualized history and canon.

Very impressed with this game.  I'm a big fan of Arabian Nights, so it should come as no surprise that I was inclined to like this storytelling game as well.  Takes a little long, but engaging.  Not nearly as many negative statuses, which tend to bog down Nights, however, a few bad rolls could really sink your game quickly.  I think this one will get played often.

Great choose your own adventure board game! I think I like Tales of the Arabian Nights just a bit more, because it has more random bits of hilarity, but that being said, my friends and I had a blast with SMERSH and will likely alternate between the two games often.

Expansions: Swagmans Hope, Showdown Scenario Book

Fun game, great storytelling. Kind of like Eldritch Horror with an solid Cold War spy theme, with the storytelling a little more controllable and thematic.

Unfortunately the gameplay itself is a little lackluster, feeling like an underdeveloped pandemic system where the challenge isn't properly balanced.

Which is a shame, because the game as it stands is just 'okay', but if that underlying system had been developed more it could have been great.

One of my new favorite cooperative games.  This game definitely needs to be played with the right people in order to get the most out of it.  This is more than a game but a story-telling and role-playing experience.  You have to flesh out your own character and immerse yourself in the story.

The stories are picked almost completely at random (except for the response groups when using the encounter book which are too broad to really use to flesh out your character) which was a little disappointing.  I thought I would have more control over my character's actions and progression with the stories being more of a "choose your own adventure" activity.  The encounter book is almost a required game addition.  It has supposedly 1200+ encounters in it and without it the deck of 20 encounter cards for each continent would get stale after only a few plays.

The rest of the gameplay is pretty neat.  You have to travel around the globe collecting intel and defeating henchmen to learn the location of the BBEG, Dr. Lobo.  You have to balance these well too because each henchman you defeat progresses the countdown to game end (which obviously needs to be done to end the game) but at the same time if the game ends without enough intel you lose.  It offers another nice layer of depth to the gameplay.

The game is nothing but theme so if you like thematic games you will really enjoy this.  The encounters fit nicely with the abilities, items, statuses, etc. of the characters and there is a lot of flavor everywhere.

I Kickstarted this game and was not disappointed.  The components are mostly all very good quality.  The one gripe I have is with the rushed rulebook and encounter booklet.  There are frequent spelling, grammatical, and other typos or missing information (such as section numbers...that are referred back to) and it wasn't really well written to boot.  I needed to print out a Rules Summary here on BGG to clarify most of the game play and setup.

Unfortunately even with a book of 1200+ encounters I imagine a game like this will always have a limited shelf life (unless they produce and release other encounter books) as reading repeated encounters would get old for anyone.  But again, 1200+ encounters should give you enough mileage on this game that that should be a distant problem.

Could have been so much more.

Two things. First, the game is simply not worth the effort without the story book, which I'm told, for some reason, they're now discontinuing?! 

And secondly,why the low rating? Well, I'll put it this way... Much like "Tales of the Arabian Nights" without so much choice or whimsy.

Could have been -so- much more.

RATING: 6.5
Fun storytelling game with whiffs of Pandemic. Players are spies working to foil the schemes of SMERSH, led by the evil Dr. Lobo, by collecting intelligence and battling his henchmen. Encounters resolve to story paragraphs and skill tests a la Tales of the Arabian Nights.

It works well, tending further towards "game" than "story-telling engine" than Tales of the Arabian Nights, but it's still mostly story. My rating reflects my general lack of interest in the genre: for fans, it's a must-have.

Great theme play, but on B movie side.  Somewhat easy to learn, but easy to play.  Game play is so-so, not much to note.  Components are good - mounted mapboard, paperboard character sheets, plastic and wood playing pieces, and not so durable cards.  Artwork is average.  Rulebook was not clear on some aspects.  Game length about 2 hours, which seems a little long.

Having never played a storytelling game before this was interesting and whilst I had fun it's not something I'd choose to play. As such take my opinion with a liberal sprinkling of salt. The decisions on the game map are clearly quite important and the players shouldn't be too aggressive. The decisions in the story segments are much harder to judge. Honestly I never had *any* idea what difference a given choice would make. As such it felt random.

RATING: 7.6
Better as a storytelling game (aka Arabian Nights) than as a coop. I like both Pandemic, Arabian Nights, and Bond/Bourne movies which puts me in a sweetspot for this game. Rating still 'only' a 7.5 as I can see problems with replayability. Though I liked the game and would not mind to play it again. 

As for gameplay, it plays fine but seems to have a tight balance between utterly failing at the game or succeeding easily. We made our first encounters without breaking a sweat, greatly easing our way for the mid- and late game. I could see that it also could've gone the other way around if you start failing some early encounters.

[EDIT 2016] Acquired my friends' copy when he was thinning out his collection. Upped my rating a notch: must say my replay worries have diminished somewhat: yes, it - like Tales of the Arabian Nights (TotAN) - will feel samey each time you play it as the encounters dictate what you do more than your own character, but as in TotAN this doesn't matter as the whole point of the game is getting you into spy mode and enjoy the wild ride. After four years, still a great game, rulebook could be better though as we had trouble getting all the little rules right, when in fact the game isn't that hard at all.

Final remark: this one is much, much better than Fortune and Glory. Why? Because there are henchmen, there is a spatial movement map which actually contributes to the tension as more and more airports close and there are story-encounters which mean theme springs out so much more, where FaG only had it's gameplay (with cliffhanger mechanic) to go on and failed on it. Glad this is in my collection!

One of my favorites in my collection. Great cooperative storytelling game. Interesting humor LOTS of replay value. We have played a half dozen times and not even used the book of encounters. I do use the extra dice from kickstarter to modify when I'm playing the first time with people who won't play a game again if they lose. You can make it pretty easy with a bag full of higher odds dice. With stock mix, it can be very challenging. I would agree with one of the other reviewers that the rule book isn't the most user friendly, but once you know how to play, it takes only a few minutes to set everything up. 

Sept. 2013: Still one of our favorites, with appeal to wider audiences. Looking forward to the expansion.

A cooperative clone of Tales of the Arabian Nights.  I prefer Tales, though, because it's prettier, funnier, and I find the "game" bolted on to SMERSH doesn't add a whole lot to the experience.

One thing I might prefer about SMERSH is that the available characters are actually differentiated.

Hilariously funny co-operative spy themed thriller of a game.

Although it is intuitive and fast flowing, it is far from easy. The tongue in cheek humour lightens the tough difficulty making it less of a sore point when you lose.

The 'choose-your-own-path' game mechanic blends perfectly with the theme creating a wonderful adventure of a game.

Amazing.

My first play was a disappointment. While I expect any game to go over the suggested time on the box - 90-120 minutes in this case - especially when it's your first play, this game dragged to 150 minutes with absolutely no end in sight. I feel as if you absolutely need to attack the Henchmen locations early and often, and yet the penalties for failing if you're not strong enough are so harsh that it could set you back significantly.

The theme is wonderful and I want to love this game. But I need to play it again and see if it's a keeper or not.

Brilliant writing, you can't fault this one for the narrative possibilities or the vibe of it. But the components are middling, and the mechanics are phoning it in as far as I'm concerned. There's next to no challenge in the but of play I've engaged in. If I hang onto this much longer it'll be for the chuckles it affords, and the hope that I can evoke such chuckles in fellow players should I ever have casual players I can bait into playing or wasted hobbyists who deem anything else beyond their impaired minds' capabilities!

Didn't care too much for this one. The theme was there but the game just wasn't any fun. Odd production choices from the oversized dice to the card designs and layouts.

RATING: 7
The blend of storybook with game is a successful one, borne out in [gameid=34119].  This game picks up the mantel with a huge book of encounters.  The title is rather strange, as although SMERSH was a real spy organization, it sounds like an incompetant villain for a children's cartoon.

There's not much of a reason to own both this and Tales, as they're close iterations of the same idea.  Decisions have more impact in Smersh (though still not much) but the writing is a bit better in Tales.  If you're a completist or a die-hard, own 'em both, but you can probably pick just one.  Given the choice, I'd opt for Tales.

Kickstarted

A story-game similar to 'Tales of Arabian Nights' in that you basicaly move around a board, choose an action to take where you land, then read the appropriate passage from a giant book, or a card that will flavor the adventure.

In Agents of Smersh, your goal is to subdue Dr. Lobo and his spy network. You begin with a set of skills which can be improved through the game. You are trying to gather 'intel' in the form of little cardboard disks which remain secret until obtained. You will need specific ones to defeat Lobo.

The fun comes from 'playing' a spy. There is luck involved here with die-rolling and card drawing, but it plays out the spy theme well and the unfolding narrative keeps the adventure fresh each time.

This is a co-operative game, and therefore, quite difficult to beat. But if one is not adverse to luck, and enjoys the story aspect, which is big in this game, then I would heartily recommend Agents of Smersh.

I struggle to see the point of the "Storytelling" boardgame genre - to my mind, that's what RPGs are for. This is a co-operative, spy-themed game and although it can create stories with some fun moments, it takes so long to get there because the boardgame mechanisms get in the way. On the other hand, the mechanisms aren't anything special and don't particularly draw me to the game and if you only wanted to try and beat the game, you might feel like the story fluff was slowing you down. It falls between two stools for me and does not provide what I want from a boardgame.

A bit more of a game than tales of the arabian nights, but I honestly do prefer tales instead due to more memorable encounters.

However, my main complaint is that the game as a whole doesn't give quite as good a story telling experience as Tales of the Arabian Nights.  You get done with that game, and you really feel like you've been through an adventure.  SMERSH just feels like you've been through a game.  It's still fun.

Fun game for non-gamers.  I like the tension that builds up as the stack of cards builds up.   Plays pretty quickly and can be pretty funny if you're playing with someone who gets stuff wrong often.

Probably wouldn't be fun with a group of people who are uptight / argumentative as it's a little subjective as to when you've taken too long.  Good fun with a group who don't really care too much about winning though.

Based on 1 play with 3 players:

There are a bunch of these speed-pattern recognition games out there: Jungle Speed (my personal favorite), Anomia, Snorta / Cluck-a-Doodle-Moo (most directly comparable) but this is one of the better ones. I would put this heads and shoulders above Anomia / Snorta (the former of which gets more predictable as you grow more familiar with the cards and is generally a little slower, and the latter of which required some house ruling by our group to really get the fun out of).

So yeah, mostly this does what it says on the tin and is funnier and funnier the more you and your friends mess up. But I will note that compared to Anomia/Snorta, it's nice that in this one that you're not competing with anyone to say something - so if you're the slowest player at the table it doesn't matter... as long as you're fast [i]enough[/i]. Feels like it might make the game comparatively less intimidating to skeptical players.

I might be biased, however, because our first game had this happen:

>My friend plays a duplicate card, and in a panic, screams "P-P-potatoes!" We all laugh at him, as potatoes [i]aren't even in the game.[/i]

>He proceeds to accidentally shout "potatoes!" [i]three more times.[/i]

>There is much ribbing and general laughter.

>Later, I play a duplicate card. In a panic, I scream "potatoes!"

>We all start laughing until the tears start flowing.

>I'm laughing and crying so hard, that the next two duplicate cards I play cause me to scream "potatoes!" simply because I cannot think of another word.

A+ would play again.

The rules, while simple, are poorly worded. See here for a clearer overview: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/12352412#12352412

Update: Its sister game, Cockroach Salad, is much the same but I think the added slurp/"mmm!" rule on this one is even funnier - especially as it's yet another thing to keep track of. I never use half points, but this seems like a good reason to give it an extra .5

Update #2: I have mixed this with Cockroach Salad. I will never go back. The extra brain squeeze of having to keep the two taboo card rules separate is just too good.

I have played Kakerlakensalat a ton of times since I got it around a year ago or so. However, I haven’t played any of the other versions until February, when I tried Kakerlakensuppe. It is almost the same game with only a small rule change. The consensus in my gaming group was that this change makes the game harder, but I suspect it might be because we’ve played Kakerlakensuppe so much.

A little bit harder version of Kakerlakensalat, because of additional syllables. The components are different, in a sense. The pictures are totally different, but they are basically the same as Kakerlakensalat. You can play it with Kakerlakensalat rules and vice versa.

I enjoy the idea of the game (constantly having to re-think what to say) but the difficulty of judging whether someone's taken too long or mispoken when they said half a syllable irks me.

Light party style game, where you must quickly name vegetables shown on cards, but some are taboo.  

Soup making theme.

Also own the similar [gameid=32341]

I think I prefer the `soup' above the `salad', because of the extra humor produced by the slurping and hmmmm noises.

RATING: 8
A great light, silly, quick filler.  Takes 30 seconds to learn.  This is my favourite, so far, of the series (I've also played Cheating Moth, Tarantula Tango, and Cockroach Poker).  The designer (Jacques Zeimet) also designed the Ghost Blitz series, which I love more, but this takes much less time to teach.

Components: correct ones
Complex: quite easy, focus on the thing you have to say on each card
Weight: party
Players: from 4
Length: less than 30 mins
Opinion: good party if you are in the mood to play it. From your deck of ingredients play one and say what ingredient you are adding, but following the rules of not saying the same as previous player, nor the same that is on the table.
The game is really fun, but you need an appropriate group of players, not everyone will enjoy it

This is really the same game as Kakerlaken-Salat, just with different vegetables and a requirement to slurp or say, "Mmm!" instead of saying "cockroach".  I think my main concern for both of these games is that you have way too many cards and it ends up dragging out a little too long.  Also the judging as to what is too long and what is okay is a little iffy and depends heavily on group consensus and self-policing, which I could see as a dealbreaker for some.

Players try to be first to run out of cards, playing one each on their turn. You must play quickly, from the top of your deck, and say the correct word(s) which vary depending on the card you turn over and what other players have done recently. It is harder than it sounds, it was often very funny. It was great- but I can only imagine myself playing "Kakkerwakker" once or twice a year.

I love all of the Kakerlaken games! This one is no exception! Very similar to Kakerlakensalat, but it has a new twist of interest...slurps and Mmmmm's! I really love this best as a 2 player game where you can actually feel your own brain synapses changing and reconnecting! Hilarious!

Similar to other kakerlaken food. 

Difference between the soup and salad - apart from a bit different set of veggies. Salad has the rule which makes it forbidden to say the word that just been said - while Soup doesn't come with it. Soup however has a rule that instead of cockroach or instead of forbidden veggie you must make a slurp sound, except if slurp just happened in which case you go "mmmm". Of course we combined both rulesets together. But just out of the box I liked salad rules better (and think slurping is for kids, ahem...).

Good party game if you play it with Kakerlakensalad rules. The "slurp" rule isn't my cup of tea, and makes the game more complicated than it needs to be.
For a shorter game, simply count the taken cards as negative points at the end of the game, instead of adding them to your hand.

We played Kakerlakenpoker before, and although it was not a great game, we had some fun with it. When we saw this on Queen’s Day, laying down on a small carpet in the grass, with a price tag of 75 cents, we couldn’t refuse to buy it. After playing this game, I wish we could have refused. The age tag of 6+ indicates that it is a simple game, and there is nothing wrong with that. Simple games can provide a lot of fun, and having fun is the most important thing there is while playing games. But the age tag is wrong. It should be 4+ maximum, which makes it a game that is meant to educate kids, and will only provide fun to adults when they are playing the game together with young kids. As we don’t have kids and don’t have plans to have some in the next 50 years, it will be hard for us, to play this game with the group where it’s meant for. But who knows what the future will bring. Until then, this game will stay on the shelf where it is right now.

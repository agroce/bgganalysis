Wonderful trick taking game that is about how you collect sets. A light and spritely mechanic makes it social, fun and keeps me coming back for more. By the designer of Agricola.

Tricks  are simply by color but if someone following runs out of the color then they may call any new color trump. Plus a few more rules around this. After a round of tricks are done you may spring clean and decide what to bank (as bargains) as long as you take off a minimal number to throw away. 'Irresistable Offer' cards trump anything. And I can't resist the German translation - 'Super Sondern Angebot' (iirc)

At game end you get to spring clean twice. End points are bargains +1 point and junk -1 point. Most points wins and ties broken by smallest junk pile.

Quite a clever twist on trick-taking where sets of a particular number and its potential replacements are collected.  Doesn't excite me as top-flight card games do as the card play seems to lack tension; until very late in the game, any cards won in a trick are potentially good.

[initiall rating: 8] Everyone (well some people, anyway) was raving about how great this was - especially for three players - and I gotta say, I liked it okay, but just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  Then, after a bunch of plays, well... I still don't think it's rave-worthy, but I have warmed to it considerably.  Especially with three players.

[years/plays later]

Solid game, but doesn't wow me anymore (not that it wow'd me much in the first place)

Sticheln in reverse and much less mean.  It's very light, but pretty engaging.  The art seems a little too cutesy for me, but the gameplay is pretty solid.  I'm not a huge trick-taking fan, but since I'm more apt to go for the ones without partnerships, this one works for me.

Their are two kind of cardgames : games with cards en real cardgames like bridge, whist, rummy and skat. Bargain hunter is a real cardgame. Real cardgames normally play fast and have clear rules. Here the rules are clear and the cardsystem is nice, but it doesn't play fluent enough. That's why it will not become a topgame to me.

A trick taking game with a twist. Not sure why there's a theme at all, certainly didn't engage me. Felt pretty dull playing, and not enough control - idea of deciding if you want to discard or trump with any suit is fine, but irrelevant if you have to follow suit anyway. Guess I'd play it again, but I'm not in any rush.

Quite typical light trick-taking game where players try to openly collect certain cards in the tricks and get rid of the rest. Is not bad but there are several other similar games which just do the same in a better way.

RATING: 7
A pretty cool, but unorthodox, trick taking game where you're focusing on winning tricks containing certain numbers.  

The trump mechanic also works very well for the game.  Essentially, you must always match the color led.  However, if you don't have that color, you may call the color you play trump (or you can decide it's not trump if you don't want the trick.

Overall, it's pretty a pretty simple trick-taking game, but comes off as a bit wacky since the goal of the game is a bit different than other trick taking games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
VERY interesting trick-taking game. Certainly not the deepest (the strategies are pretty straightforward), but the way the scoring and trumps work is kooky enough to interest anyone who like trick takers. Even though it's pretty simple, the unique mechanics make it extremely fun. It's light, unique, plays quickly, and since your junk pile stays from hand to hand, allows for more of a long term strategy compared to most trick takers. The only problem is since you're forced to play in suit and you have so few cards and there are so many suits, it really can feel like your hand dictates your plays completely sometimes. I definitely feel helpless looking at my hand when other players play certain cards.

1 play, 3p. Took a few rounds to get it. Clever, interesting, fun game. I was happy to end with a positive score. Very challenging, trick taking and set collection, the two mechanics almost making two games in one. I wonder about the memory element which may limit the altitude of my liking of it, but I do like it.

Great trick-taking gaming with a twist.  Trump can be called...or not...but not by the lead player.  You show everyone what you are collecting...except for what remains hidden.  Easy to teach but deep enough to draw you back.  Quick play that will become the newest go-to card game in my group.

RATING: 7
Schnaeppchen is a bizarre trick taking game that features 6 suits and utterly unheard of trumping procedures where players can choose whether the card they are playing in a given trick is trump or not. The object is not to collect tricks per se, but to collect cards of a certain number. When you take tricks in your number, they go onto your score pile, the rest go into the junk yard, which can be cleared after each hand, with all of a chosen number being removed from the pile with 2 going back into the deck, and the rest onto your score pile. Very strange, and takes some getting used to, but very appealing as well. The large number of suits and small hand size means that the game is almost entirely out of control, but that said, this is short, it's essentially filler, and I really like the original ideas present here.

It might be added that I'm now a convert of the "3 players only" school with this game...I can see now why that number of players is optimum, mainly because it allows you to actually try to take tricks more aggressively in the first couple of rounds of the game. The math is pretty clear: with 3 players you play 6 rounds, and you get 7 clears, which effectively means you can start the game only avoiding 2 card ranks, as the game goes, you have to keep winnowing it down, but I like that progression. In the 4 player game you only get 5 clears total, so the game starts out very limited from the get-go.

Final note: One of the best attributes of this game is its very short length, either 4 or 6 rounds. Most card games tend to play out over the course of an hour or so, but Jagd is more like 30 minutes and a reliable closer because of its limited round number. A nice attribute. I can rate this game a 7 on that basis, because I think of it as high quality filler more than as an actual proper "card game" in the vein of Tichu, Cosmic Eidex, Doppelkopf, and the like; mainly because it is an almost purely tactical exercise.

Update: I picked up the new Bargain Hunter edition. Coworkers liked it enough to commandeer it from me. Takes a few games to really see the game. Fairly subtle. But lots of luck. But I was wrong about "no arc". It's there, but the untrained eye won't notice it.
---
I had heard about this many times and would have bought, were it available. In this case I think my expectations were a little too high, as I was underwhelmed. Sure, it's a clever trick taking game, but I found the lack of control a bit unsatisfying. Gameplay is so simple that there's no "arc" to the hands like there is in many other card games (Mu, Tichu, etc). I won't be forking out the big $$$ to import this. I'd pick it up if it were available cheap, though, and would be happy to play again.

Production: Nice images of various appliances.  Card quality is average.  Cards should have been full-color (meaning the entire card’s background was one color), rather than featuring the colored-suit only in the background of the appliance, and in a suit-specific shape, which isn’t as clear as it could have been.  Play: Very interesting combination of wanting to take certain tricks, and wanting to lose certain tricks.  It absolutely matters what is in each trick, so one’s desire for a particular trick changes as the trick plays out.  Definitely fun, but difficult to play well with a bad hand, unlike many other trick-taking games.  (1+0+3) (3 plays)

Excellent trick taking game that plays well with three or four people. Players are trying to collect treasure (a single number) and avoid trash (any other number) in the tricks won. At the end of each hand, the trash may be examined to convert it into treasure. At the end of a set number of hands your final score is treasure minus trash. Fun, and rather addictive.

A good entry into the trick-taking-with-a-twist category.  Here, you are trying to win tricks with certain numbers in them, as those cards from your tricks will score you points, but the other non-target-value cards will hurt your score.   Unless you collect enough of those to make them your new target number.   Couple other twists with trump make it a game that keeps you on your toes.

Another trick-taking game... blah. Ok, it's not fully senseless but I've found some better ones from that genre -although I've never appreciated trick-taking games very much. 

Idea is to try to get into points while everyone has some certain cardnumber they try to collect from tricks they get. All the other cards in trick go to rubbish pile and it's legal to take a look on them if needed. It's better to have much of some certain cardnumbers there. After the round, everyone who has 3 cards or more with same number on their rubbish piles, puts 3 cards of them to discard pile and the excessive cards are put on the points pile in front of the players that's now showing the new cardnumber to be collected. At the end of game, all the cards in rubbish pile score negative points. Works someway but I rather play something else...

It took a while for this game to click.  I tried several times with several different groups.  My last time playing, suddenly I got it.  This game is awesome!  There's basically a game behind the game.  The obvious trick taking game where you are trying to get your "open" number, but you are secretly choosing other numbers as well that you actually want to win.  As long as you get 2 good cards and only 1 bad card when you win a trick, then you're set.  If you do a good job of keeping hidden your secret numbers, then you can have a good shot of doing this.  This makes it a very interesting card game for 3.  Paid $30 shipped for this, a bit high for a card game, but definitely worth it for this OOP game which works outstandingly well for 3.

I wasn’t expecting much from this Valley Games card game, having bought it as part of a big order when a lot of the publisher’s stock was on a great sale.  But Bargain Hunter surprised me by actually being a pretty good and rather unique trick-taking game.  It’s turned out to be a hit with my children and I.  This older gem from the esteemed Uwe Rosenberg plays quickly (just 4 rounds) and gives each player some interesting objectives.  The goal is to collect as many cards in one specific suite (out of 9 different ones) as possible within each round, but that suite is chosen by each player for themselves, and can be changed from round to round.  It can also be very beneficial to collect a lot of cards from a second suite, while all of the rest will effectively count against you.  Each trick consists of just one card from each player, and when players can’t follow the lead player’s color, they can choose to play another card color as trump – or not.  It can feel a bit chaotic at times, but there’s some cool strategy to be found, and it easily held our interest throughout our first game.  I think it’s one of the better card games I’ve picked up in a long while.

RATING: 10
This is a very interesting game. I'm not much of a fan of trick taking games, but this one is fun.

You're trying to collect items of the same kind, like toasters, per round. The more you got, the better, because those are your plus points (# of cards). But with the tricks you'll take, you'll be getting lots of other merchandise, that will be trash to you, meaning negative points (# of cards). But at the end of each round, you can get rid of some of the trash, specifically 1 type of item you pick. Then the first few cards go on a discard pile, and the rest will be your new bargain item, you'll be hunting for. 

And so it goes for 4 or 6 rounds, based on # of players. Easy rules, but which tricks to take and not to take is a pretty fun challenge. Plus the colorful and funny cards make up for a simple game. Hard to get these days, but fun to have.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (May 2017)

Uwe Rosenberg is among my all-time favorite game designers. Having said that, I no longer enjoy his lighter games. When I began playing boardgames on 2010, I really liked Bohnanza but I no longer want to play that game. Due to this, I wasn’t sure what to expect from Bargain Hunter. As it turned out, the game was a bit better than expected, but still not a game for me.

The game´s box is way too big for a deck of cards, I guess they made it that way to store the rulebooks. It comes with many of them in a lot of languages, including Spanish, but I would have preferred a small box.

The rules of the game are easy to teach. You can do it under 6 minutes. The only tricky part to explain are the sale yards after every round, but overall, the rules are very simple. Playtime is also short, around 40 minutes.

The game´s components are ok. The art is cartoonish, not to my liking but it serves its purpose.

Best with 3 players.

Bargain Hunter is a trick taking game, another genre I don’t enjoy as much as before. In this case, the trump can be the second suit played after the first, the decision is with the player which is novel for me. The contents of the trick also matters a lot as you try to score points from what you are currently seeking, but you are also planning your junk pile for the future. I found the decisions rather easy, but I also feel the game has more deepness that it is apparent at first. The luck factor is high.
 
Bottom line, Bargain Hunter is perhaps a great trick taking game, but I no longer enjoy these kind of games. If you like the genre, you should try it, but it isn’t for me. It is a bit boring and I and I already sold the game.

Nice twist on whist-style trick taking genre.

You can only score for one value of card at a time (imagine scoring only - say - jacks in whist), any player can declare trump suit if he can't match the lead, and the cards you win that are not of your chosen value score against you. (While you can change the value that scores for you through the game, essentially you can only score for one value at a time).

This means you have to be careful not to take too much rubbish when you score cards of use to you (ie. the trick is knowing which tricks not to take), along with an appreciation of how to sour tricks for others.

RATING: 8
Modern trick-taking games often stumble over themselves trying to bring something new to the genre. Bargain Hunter is the exception. Very nifty the way you can choose to call a card trump or not, the way your target cards are changed, and in how scoring unfolds. Very engaging play with clean, interesting mechanics. Solid game. Why Valley Games needed to publish it in a box more than five times the necessary size is a mystery. The packaging choice is extremely disappointing.

RATING: 7
Another odd trick-taking game that I seem to enjoy more than any of my fellow gamers. Players have to follow suit, when a player can’t follow the suit, he can decide if the colour he plays instead will be trump. Each round, players have one of the numbers 1-9 as their bargain that scores points. Every other number remains in the trick stack a.k.a. junk pile. After each round, players can remove one of the numbers from the junk pile to make it their next bargain if they have gathered enough of it. At the end, junk cards are deducted from bargain cards, highest result wins.

The first one or two rounds nobody will know what they are doing as it’s mostly unclear what a trick will be worth. Once past this hurdle, Bargain Hunter’s loose trick structure offers possibilities for clever play although at the cost of some chaos. Three players might be better than our round with four. A game worth getting reprinted but I’m disappointed with the production value of the Valley Games reprint. Too large box, ugly design, cheap card stock. It doesn’t help that rules are included in 8 languages including two Chinese ones.

Only play with 3 players... and if we have 3 at work I want to play Ra instead.  At home with 3 I want to play Big City... so it gets less play time than it should.

RATING: 7
I enjoy the theme of this game and think the card art is kind of neat - especially the super special deal!  Initially it seems like the game will be absolute chaos resulting in tons of negative points, though with good planning you can actually get a pretty good score.  It's important to manage your cards well - the unpredictability of the trumps complicates this task.  The rules are initially kind of odd, especially the whole part about declaring whether a new color played is a trump or not, but relatively easy to learn and makes for a good 3-person game.

                                                   matters, and the theme makes at least as much sense as any trick-taking game theme
                                                   does. Additionally, it plays with 3 very well in addition to working well with 4.

Enjoyable trick-taking game that shines because of the recycle mechanic.  Players have a good pile and a poison pile but after each round they can take 3 like cards from the poison pile and add them back into the deck.  Extra cards with that number are added to the good/point pile.  This allows for some long-term strategy which is rare in a card game.

By now play is so familiar to us that a bit of trash-talking creeps into our games, unusual for us, but in this case very amusing (and even appropriate--ha!). [106 plays]

Trick taking game based on collecting junk. Cards are numbered 1 to 10 in different suits. Each round, each player selects a number from their hand. This number scores them points, all others count against them, but at the end of each round, each player is allowed a &quot;clean up&quot;, to discard any two collected numbers they choose. At game end, another clean up is allowed. Not a strong trick taking game, too many other good ones out there.

RATING: 7
What a great card game that is a bit confusing to explain.  Every 'clean up' round you can change the bargain you are looking for, you just have to discard three of them to start off.  At the beginning of the game you can start off your first bargain for free however.

To collect your bargains every player plays one card, the winner takes all the cards into their junk pile, which could potentially turn into points every clean up round.

A trick taking game at it's heart, with a confusing scoring mechanism, the game really is a blast after everyone knows what is going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (3 players): Pretty unique as a trick-taking game that is played certain number of rounds. Trump can be declared differently to every trick and scoring is pretty clever. You collect certain number in every round that counts as plus (everything else is basically minus) but after every round you may get rid of one set certain number in your minus point pile. You score plus for having more than 3 of it and change your "plus number". I really liked this aspect of the game. 

My biggest complain about the game is that because there is follow-suit and forced-trump -playing, you easily are forced to take tricks in hands where you have a rainbow hand (hand is 8 cards with 6 suits) and are unable to do anything about it.

[b]Bargain Hunter[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8/10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Anyone who has read some of my previous entries knows I am always looking for new card games to introduce to my dad and son, especially trick takers. The list is long [i](Cobras, Diamonds, Haggis, Parade, Potato Man, Sticheln, Stichling, X Nimmt! and more)[/i] and only two had survived more than a handful of plays, but now Bargain Hunter is the third game added to the list. Our regular rotation of card games had been Diamonds and Parade, but now Bargain Hunter is on the list. 

My original write up gets into some of the specifics of game play, suffice it to say Bargain Hunter doesn't play like a lot of other card games. Since the trump suit is determined by players and constantly changing this isn't an easy game to get on your first couple of plays. However; if you stick with it you will find a brilliant trick taker full of difficult choices. Bargain Hunter one of my favorites and while I like it more than my dad and son, it is a game we all want to continue to play. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I've finally found another trick taking game that not only plays great with 3, but was also a huge hit with my son and dad! We play a lot of 3 player card games with Parade and Diamonds being our most frequently played. For the last few years we've tried a bunch of new games and none of them have stuck around for more than a few plays (Linko, Potato Man, Stichling, Sticheln were a few that didn't make the cut). Bargain Hunter will be played alongside our long time favorites: Parade and Diamonds.

It definitely takes a play to figure out how the game works because the mechanics are unlike many other trick taking game since trump suit is very fluid in this game. Clever play will definitely win you the game, there is a lot more planning than appears at first glance. I'd highly recommend seeking this out if you enjoy trick takers.[/i]

50+ plays. One of the best 3 player card games out there. Two things make it special -  the choice of trumping with any offsuit, and the junk / treasure pile score mechanism - and twists this into a non-typical trick taking feel. In the early hands you're trying to win. In the latter you're mostly playing misere. A close watch on what people are collecting is key, as you're trying to discard cards onto them that they haven't been collecting, and being careful here can be the difference between winning and losing. We're still playing this regularly as a 3 player closer multiple times every year.

This is a very nice three player trick taking game.  While it certainly resembles other trick taking games out there it is different enough to be worth it.  I suspect the hype for this comes from the fact that this is a solid game that is strangely out of print.  I don't think it is going to blow anyone's mind, but I do think that it should be in more homes.  I suspect that because this plays so cleanly, people feel the urge to proselytize in its favor.

My copy is a home-made one from Verkisto. 1 play at LobsterTrap 06.

A very old game, supposed to be great with 3. I got a homemade copy from Verkisto, but still hadn't had a chance to try the game!

This is a trick-taking game. There are 6 suits with cards numbered 1-9. From your initial hand, choose 1 card and start your GOOD pile. Player to left of leader leads a card. Then, players must follow suit if possible. If not possible, may play any card. When they play the card, they declare (choose) whether or not it's trump. High-card (or high-trump) takes the trick. From the trick, all cards (any color) whose NUMBER matches your good pile go to your good pile; the rest go to the BAD pile. Play through the hand. At end, look through BAD pile; may discard 1 set of 3 matching numbers; any additional duplicates are added to the GOOD pile, and becomes your new Good number (scored from tricks). All discarded cards are added to the bottom of the draw deck. You play several (3?) rounds, getting almost through the entire deck. On the last round, you can set aside 2 trips. Then add up the points: 1 VP/GOOD card, -1VP/BAD card. Highest score wins.

This was one of the few games I actually won this weekend! It was good, but based on my single plays I really prefer Flaschenteufel. I do want to play this some more because it's a little tricky.

6/10 for now, but I think this might go up some with additional play.

One of the better trick-taking games I have played in a while.  Reminds me of Coloretto in a weird way, since you are rewarded for multiple cards of the same type and penalized for extras.  I shouldn't have been surprised that a game with such interesting mechanics was developed by Uwe Rosenburg.  One of those games where each round of my first game I kept discovering more layers of strategy.

[Queens Game 98 edition] {Shopping; trick-taking, set collection; optimal 3p} Schnäppchen Jagd is a nice combination of set-collection and trick-taking game. It is fun, intuitive and thematic. Player interaction is quite good, too. It's a tactical game with some planning but players usually have to adjust their plan during a play because it's not easy to predict what cards one will collect in future rounds. Good card counting skill will help because you can choose a junk to collect more wisely.

The illustration of the cards is very cute. There are icons on the cards to help distinguish the colors. The box is a little bit bigger than necessary. It's a pity that it's only accessible in German and OOP. It's a good game but it is not worth USD40. I would like to have an illustrated English rulebook!

Printed animal cards from Artscow. This card game has more than meets the eye, but I'll have to play this more to get a better handle on the strategy. Is it just a matter of collecting as many cards as possible at the beginning and then fine-tuning the Odds & Ends or does a more level approach work better? Time shall tell.

Set-collection trick-taking card game.  Not enough interesting about it to make it stand out.

Decent multiple set collection filler.  I liked it.

Fun game. Very good with 3 but still fun with 4, although there are better trick taking games with that number. Own both editions, will probably never play the original now.

Spiffy game. I can't yet figure out whether you ought to take a whole lot or a whole little in this trick-taking game. Scores tend to be pretty close.

Been having more fun with these "traditional" card games, this one had some twists and was overall pretty fun.

This game has more than meets the eye. You need to play it a couple of times. Excellent concept!

Fabulous three player card game that I've been after for ages. Usual counter-intuitive Rosenberg mechanics that fit together to make a tight and clever game.

After first game, feels pretty nice trick game. But hard to say anything wise before couple games more.

I'm not too sure about the theme, but the game is solid (even if I'm no good at it)

Great trick-taking game. Very clever (to be expected from an Uwe Rosenberg game).

One of my favorite 3 player games.  It also plays 4 but 3 is the best number.  It's a trick taking game with a twist.  Players are collecting treasures which is equivalent to a specific card number.  When a trick is taken the treasures that are being collected going into the treasure pile while the rest go into the junk pile.  At the end of each hand you can clear one type of junk out of your junk pile, 2 or 3 get discarded back to the deck while the rest go into your treasure pile changing what you are publically collecting.  Another twist is that there are multiple of each card and when both are played to a trick the second player gets to decide if it's higher or lower.  Also the first person to play to a trick who doesn't have the color led gets to play a card and declares whether that color is or isn't trump for the rest of the trick.  This means each trick can have a differnt trump.  All in all a very enjoyable game.

A rare three-handed trick taking game.  Pasted-on theme can't stand in the way of solid mechnics, though the Special Bargain cards seem out of place.

Ok trick-taking game.

This game is a weird blend of a trick-taking game and a rummy game, two styles of card games that I like, so of course, that gives the game bonus points.  The way that trump is determined (for each trick, no less!) makes it wonky enough for me to enjoy it.

Out of respect for the world's oldest profession, all trick-taking games get a 6 unless they're particularly bad or particularly good.

This one is better than average.  I'm in a cranky mood today, though, so the 6 sticks.

I'm really surprised by how many excellent 3-player trick taking card games there are compared to the standard ones (like hearts, spades and euchre) I grew up with.  This unusual title was a bit hard to teach at first, but once we got the clearing rules straight, the rest was fairly enjoyable.  A good addition to a growing list of card games to play when you're waiting for a fourth.

Delightful skewing of trump-making rules; however, it always feels like this game would have a little more punch if it could be played by more people, so the strange trump choices would cause even more chaos.  Nonetheless, this is a fun game with very cute bargains to collect.

A clean trick-taking game that nevertheless feels unique and has some neat twists. An easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys trick-taking, especially those on the lighter side.

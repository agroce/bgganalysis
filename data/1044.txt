Gunslinger is *far* from perfect, but at the end of a game, when you can close your eyes and see the last couple of hours spent sitting around the game table as they would look in 15-30 seconds on a movie screen, it is unmatched.

Cards are unpunched. Counters are unpunched, a few have fallen off the sprue. Some of the counters have some discoloration, maybe from storage in high humidity. Boards are in excellent condition, no warping or discoloration. Rule book cover has come free of the rule book. Box is intact, but shows wear, especially the box top which has the bottom left corner beginning to split. player aid cards have faded a bit. Legend sheet pad complete and unused.

Owned and only played solo. For a subject that is so lightening fast as man to man gun fighting, the rules are hugely turgid in typically Avalon Hill style. But it does make for a very accurate simulation of the subject. If you can stand the slowness of everything.

RATING: 10
This game of western gunfight from the golden era of Avalon Hill sees the action played out in a wealth of slow-motion detail that Sam Peckinpah would have been proud of. The Gunsmith's Shop and Critters variants from the pages of The Avalon Hill General provide even more detail to this excellent game.

A few years back I took part in some blind multiplayer pbem games that were truly memorable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite game. I particularly like the larger showdowns (10 characters or more) played by email using CyberBoard (either double-blind or otherwise). The color, chrome and level of detail draw you in, and the characters take on individual personalities. The complexity of the rules is an unfortunate necessity, to enable the broad range of actions open to a character/player. Anyway, having played the game since 1982, I'm used to them!

25 Jan 07:  Probably the BEST multi (more than two) player game I've ever played.  A single copy of the game (which can still be found on places like eBay for reasonable costs) will allow up to seven people to play.  With two copies of the game (and a couple of players who know the rules well) you can devise scenarios which allow 8-10 or (even more) people to play.  Little down time, agonizing decisions, differing skills amongst the game characters, just enough randomness to add to the challenge and excitement--this one has it all!!

The only drawbacks to this game (IMHO) are:
1.  Players can be eliminated.  This can be mitigated by playing team scenarios, and letting the players play 2 or 3 characters each, so that if one player has all their characters eliminated, they can "borrow" one from someone else on their team, and continue to participate.
2.  The semi-blind "hunting" rules are kind of kludgy.  We set up additional maps on other tables, so that characters from one team which are no longer visible to any of their enemies can move on that table.  Obviously, we use the "honor system" about what the other characters are doing, though we always have at least one other player from the same team "oversee" the moves.

One of the most enjoyable game. It has a lot of replay value. Very tense situation and fun to play. I still remember the time we play during High School. We each control several characters and do scenario like Bank robbing etc. The optional rules on two stories buildings add an extra dimension to the game. Love the Saloon with the second story which has an empty space in the middle. I still remember the time, that some character get shot and stagger through the railings, falling down from there. Really Hollywood like. If you like western, this is a must have.

I'm only missing about 4 or 5 counters so its no big deal. the play deck is 99% intact. This game takes an 18 second gunfight and makes a 40 minute game out of it. Some folks wont enjoy this (hello, Euros!) but I rather enjoy it. It reduces every action down to the single deck of cards - which serve multiple purposes. Each reload, shot, chance to hit, hit location, damage, and if you're shot, where you stumble and fall - all controlled by the single large deck of playing cards.

This game needs reprinting just for the collectible/nostalgia of it - not so much because it would translate very well to contemporary gaming palettes.

Not a real deep game, or a real strategic game, but it does a good job recreating a western gunfight.  It's a game that can be taught relatively quickly.  There is player elimination and the damage done by each shot is somewhat random, so you've got to be comfortable with a high luck factor.   

I'd say it's a classic beer and pretzels game with a high fun factor.  Our first game played well with five, but took about 3 hours to explain & play.  Player elimination means the first to die is going to have to sit around until the game is over and the next game starts.

It does show it's age and is ripe for a remake/reprint.  The downside of an older game is you do have to look up the damage from each weapon type on a chart.  If  you like this game, Kremlin is another one in a similar vein that I'd recommend.

RATING: 8
This really is a good game of man to man combat in the Old West. Probably not as popular as it should be because of the relative complexity of the rules.
Each turn represents a very short (seconds) period of time in which each player secretly chooses their upcoming actions in the form of a number of cards and reveals as the turn unfolds. There is therefore a good deal of suspense as you don't know whether you opponent is about to make a rush to close combat or duck into cover and start aiming at you.
Players have different 'hands' of cards to choose from depending upon their characters abilities and there is a lot of replayability due to numerous scenarios and the ability to basically build your own.

A tense western-style shoot-em up with old-school Avalon Hill rules. They are mildly cumbersome but serve to simulate the genre. The bigger problem though is the names of the actions you can take.

Downgraded the rating (and ultimately sold my copy) just because of pacing. I think this is a great concept and well-executed for the time, but the 2015 it just moves a bit slowly with the game taking a while to develop if you're not totally into the genre and theme. Still a highly recommended game *if* you're in the niche its targeting but not a general-access one. One of the things I think that's great about it is that it tries to be fairly reality-based, unlike the modern and more genre-oriented western games. The fantasy of the western is a slightly toxic one in the US currently, so it's nice to see it somewhat de-mystified.
---
Not nearly as complex as you think, a fun, brutal, and somewhat realistic simulation of old west gunfights. Double-blind produces an even better game, although with the usual issues with that format (like, one player doesn't get to play).

Complicated game, still learning.  If you learn the rules via the way the book instructs, the first few games may seem a little lackluster.

I have to say that this is probably the toughest comment I've ever posted on BGG.  The thing is, Gunslinger is an incredible piece of design- the amount of detail and narrative it captures in a relatively short set of rules is extraordinary and it is far and away the best western-themed game ever published (and it's MILES ahead of Bang! on every level).  The way time is scaled in the game is beautiful, with every gunfight rendered in slow-motion, Sam Peckinpah detail- some folks might not like it, but I _love_ it.  I love how the events in the game are so specific, I love how there's tons of options summed up on just a handful of cards, I love how you can peek around corners and over water troughs.  I really love the game.  So why is this a problem to write?  Because I think Mr. Hamblen was just way too far ahead of his time on this one- it definitely needs a little streamlining as some of the procedures are a little clumsy- and with modern development it could be not only the definitive western game but also the definitive man-to-man combat game. I was really surprised at how easy the game is once you cut through the Don Greenwood-style rulebook and actually explain it- it's the sort of game where all the rules make perfect logical sense even though some of it (like the time points concept) is fairly opaque at first.  As I write, I find that it's getting easier to home in on a decision about the game- I think it's definitely a "crippled" 10, taken to a 8 solely for some of its more awkward elements.  This is a great game that shouldn't be missed, that's for sure, and anyone with an interest in narrative games, the Old West, or fanfiring a Colt .45 shouldn't hesitate to pick up this classic.  Forget Bang!- it's BLAZING SADDLES to this game's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.

Nice tactical game from Avalon Hill. Innovative game engine of using cards to preselect action types and further defining those actions when revealed.

I think the game is more fun with the less effective weapons otherwise it degenerates to watching people take a single shot and then eventually bleeding to death or passing out while they try, in vain, to remove delay counters.

We only played 3 times and haven't used the terrain rules yet or any of the optional rules.

Hands down my favorite gun fight game.  It gives you that Sam Peckinpah feel.  Time is dialed down to the split second, do aim for the better shot or blaze away and hope to get lucky?  The only downside is with the tiny scale, the scenarios go straight to the gun fight with very little lead in.  But if you want to do the gun fight from Unforgiven, this is the game!

We played one afternoon in a saloon brawl. Within the space of a couple of hours, and less than 40 seconds of game-time, we found the whole range of human behaviors, from the lower depths of misery to heights of compassion and nearly heroism, even if - by far and large - pure grudge was prevalent. To those add gratuitous violence. 

What a game!!! A game where it is better to throw a chair rather than shoot, or by that matter even jab, swing and anything else other than shoot. 

I really want this in my collection, and I won't recommend this because I don't want you bastards from buying my copy under my nose! That is MY COPY!!! :)

I love Richard Hamblen's designs, so this was a no-brainer. Still, I think its my least favourite of his games, certainly lagging behind Magic Realm and Merchant of Venus. It's complex and a bit fiddly and suffers somewhat from the issue I used to have with Car Wars.....too much detail to oversimulate short periods of time (hours of game play to fight showdowns lasting a few seconds). Victory objectives in the scenarios aren't always straightforward and quick player elimination is a problem for long multiplayer scenarios. Still, it's a Hamblen game and lots of fun, despite its warts. Glad I have it and will play it any time.

AH takes on the Hollywood version of the "Old West".  Interesting game system, but became repetitive after a while.  The weapons are well detailed, and accurate in their depictions.  Though, everyone is WAY too accurate with handguns, for this to be a simulation.
This is area that is best suited for computer sims, IMHO.

One of my all-time-favourites!

Despite the impressive rulebook Gunslinger is relatively easy to learn thanks to a step-by-step learning system. Once you grasp the basic system the game is uncomplicated to play and if you ignore some of the parts that cause a lot of rule interpretations, such as elevation or using a lot of obstacles, it plays easily and fast.

Los puntos fuertes de este juego es su intensidad y un gran equilibrio entre realismo y jugabilidad. Las campañas le dan un añadido extra aunque su verdadero punto fuerte es la parte de rol que tiene. Sin embargo, para jugarlo como rol se necesitan varios jugadores.
No es aconsejable para jugadores impacientes y que se depriman si son sacados del juego a las primeras de cambio. La paciencia, el faroleo y tener una vision general de la situacion dan sus frutos en el; en cambio, el jugador de gatillo facil puede ver como sus opciones desaparecen a las primeras de cambio.

Old Avalon Hill wargame that I still enjoy.  It takes a little while to get the basic flow of the game.  Once you do however, the gameplay is smooth and easy to imagine what you are doing.  

The only downside I've found is wanting to do more!  The rules are there, but is structured so you are building more and more to the core rules.  This can make it a little difficult to find the rule that you are looking for.

RATING: 8
Gunfights in the Old West. A game emphazising the 'fun' of gaming over a well-balanced contest. More than anything else it's a game where you have fun at what's happening during the game, and where you keep narrating your tales of woe and success for months afterwards. Luck plays a big part in the game, so don't play if you can't stand being eliminated from the game in the first turn, through no fault of your own. Still, playing this in the right frame of mind makes for a very entertaining few hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was excited about the narrative generating possibilities of this game, and it was pretty fun the one time I played it. But the rules are quite detailed and rather different from anything else I own; in order to get the most out of the game it would need to be played with a regular game group of experience players. That's not how I've been playing games lately, so I think I'm going to get rid of it to make room for more suitable titles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The spiritual ancestor of Robo Rally in that there are five programmed actions per turn (though in Gunslinger one action may take up multiple "rounds" so it is unlikely a player will actually take five actions on most turns), but with a somewhat more complex rule set.  As a game of microtactics it's very good and after a few plays I'm convinced that there's enough roleplaying detail even within a single showdown to sustain a high rating.

The theme is take-or-leave; I'm indifferent to it but obviously the game has more appeal for Old West buffs.

My Game is a "homemade" version of Gunslinger, because it is out of print and I never found a copy cheap enough for me to buy. Played once with beginner rules on PBEM using GameBox. Although, I didn't care much for playing PBEM, I really liked the game itself.

A novel card-based game system that recreates gunfights/combat in the 'Old West.'  Each turn is supposed to simulate six seconds of 'real time' and that is where the game breaks down for me... why should a gunfight that, in real time, takes under 90 seconds play out in 2 hours?  If it wasn't for the added role-playing aspects included, I probably would have rated it lower.

With a bit of tweaking and re-development I'm really not sure why this game system was never used for other types of games... Pro Wrestling, Sword fighting, WWII firefights, etc.

Yer basic hoot.  I don't usually like Programmed Instruction (give it to me all at once; I can take it) and I miss the speed ratings of "Boot Hill" (Greased Lightning??  Holy cow!) but it's still a great game.  Realistic?  I don't know, not being an expert on Old West shootouts.  But fun, most definitely.  I love it when everyone unloads their Peacemakers and nobody's been hit; the antagonists stand there and blink for a few seconds before execising the better part of valor and hot-footing it for cover.

One of the greatest games of all time, I have played this one the most times of all my games, and with more people than any other game.  In depth rules that are common sense, and therfore easy to teach new gamers.  Basically you set your moves one turn ahead and go at...unless of course your hit and just lay there while your opponent takes more and more aim with his gun!  A great game which allows you to recreate just about any scenario you can think of from a movie, or it has actual historical scenarios.  There are eight game boards, and on each one side has a town setting, while the other has a country setting.  Rules include all kinds of weapons (even a gunbelt upside the head), wagons, horses, dynamite, thrown chairs, etc. etc.  It doesn't get much better than this one.

My first 10. A really outstanding game. Gunslinger is like a sergio leone movie. You play the action in slow motion, step by step. After some hours (this is a long game...) you can look backward (rewind) and imagine the scene you created (which lasts only a few seconds). A lot of details. Not so realistic but so lively. I play it with my sons 13 and 10. A must have if you like western movies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clunky old-school AH rules conceal a relatively lightweight wargame of simultaneous action selection. Someone should take a scourer to the ruleset and redo this one - it could really shine in the right hands. Slow motion gunfight has a balletic/chess-like quality which I don't think you'd see in newer gunfighting games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating  for the basic version is a 6. I liked it and it captured the feeling of a gunfight well. It was missing somethings like switching to another hand

I think based on the little info I have on the advanced version 7 is an appropiate rating. Maybe the added complexity wills low things downa bit.  I thought the basic version moved quickly.

Horrible game. First because it's old so it use a lot of old mechanics, like tables, which takes a lot of time to resolve. The game focus more on realism than playability.

Second, it is very annoying to play. The fact that you can program your move with a huge set of cards takes a lot of time to analyse. Programming actions is also annoying in it self. 

Also the delay tokens is pretty annoying because do not spend delay but rather loose half of it. So I have been delayed for at least 4 turns in a row not being able to do anything important.

So the 2 hours I have played consisted in backing up behind the bar, exiting by the window and exiting the map. In other words, it took me 2 hours to do nothing important.

So imagine trying to pick up the money and leave.

One of the best from A.H. Great game, great set of solitaire rules. Pretty easy to design your own scenarios/showdowns. Take any action from about any Historical situation (or period small unit action) or Western Novel or Western Movie and there you go. Cowboys, Indians, Outlaws, Posses, Miners, Trappers, Mountain Men, Sheriffs, Soldiers, Gamblers, Cooks, Bartenders, Saloon Girls, Rangers, Town Folks Bar Swamper, Preacher, Stable boy, School Marm even horses and cattle, wagons & wild animals are all in and can be deadly. They can fight with or against each other, as few or as many as as you want but at least about 4 or 5 is good. Very versitle. Can be balanced or very unbalanced, sometimes tedious but still a blast to play. Lots of on-line support.

Typical for a Hamblen design, there are some neat game concepts here. Also typical (to me, anyway), the rules are very unclear, and a lot of the concepts aren't explained very well. Components are very nice. Despite the initial appeal, there is just not a lot here for me. You'll spend 45 minutes modeling a 15 second gunfight, and whoever gets hit first usually loses (realistic, perhaps, but just not all that fun to play, IMO). I would call this a noble failure.

[played 5+ times]

It's a good simulation of a west figthing. Rules cover shooting, figthing, diving in serch of cover while aiming at your ennemy head.
The side effect is that rules are huge and, like other old games, full of exception: so, before starting you have to read and understand (and explain to other players too) a lot. In order to speeed up this phase you end to play the OK corral scenario (the simplest), that give you only a bit of "west flavour" that this game have.

A fun old western shoot'em up. The rule book make it look harder to play than it really is so when you pick the rules up don't panic. Play a simple scenario first and once you get that under your belt you'll be fine.

Played the first scenario, which was very one-dimensional because of programmed instruction.  It was interesting enough to have my gaming group try a more advanced showdown in the future.  One of the more fun multi-player games from this era, and one of the few with this virtually-untapped theme.

A fun game of cowboys killing each other. Strategy and &quot;goodness&quot; of the game depends greatly upon the scenario. Played this 3 times and I need to play it more to get a better fell for it. Then maybe I&#039;ll raise the score from a 7 to an 8.

Excellent system for simulating split-second actions.  Fun game and very tight.  A little complex for current tastes, but well worth the exercise. Note, this game is a true simulation and not a fun "movie" game.  It's about most everyone dying within the next 30 seconds of simulated time.  As a simulation, it excels.  As a game, well, you might be dead by turn 2.

It's a cross between Robo Rally and Car Wars really, except really slow and fiddly with lots of rules and look-up tables. You have a basic set of 26 or so actions to program (each character may have some special extra actions) and each action costs between 1 and 3 segments depending on how good it is. Each turn, you program actions worth up to 5 segments. Example actions are draw and cock, aim, shoot, run, duck, turn, kick, jab, etc. The result of a shot is decided by card draw (random function of range and how many segments you spent aiming). If you hit, the type of hit is checked against tables to determine how much damage you've accrued.

I can see that when people got proficient with the rules and the programming possibilities, and playing a more interesting scenario with buildings and terrain, that this could be a decent game. There's plenty of boards provided for such. That's a big time investment though. We did have lots of fun - it's not hard to find plenty of sick and off-colour humour with all that cocking, aiming and shooting going off. Taking a minute to resolve each split second move tends to make a mockery of the theme unfortunately.

Based on one play: One of those games where theme is more important then game play. The play is tedious and slow. Also, all your work over 2-3 turns can be wasted based on one card, since at the end, the cards decide if your actions work out and the cards are so random that you cannot really plan at all. Way too much nuances to be fun.

(1 play)  This is a very detailed action simulation of a gunfight.  We tried the first showdown, the feeling of the staredown, trying to decide if you want to knock off a quick shot, or take some time to aim your gun, risking your opponents quick shot taking you out first.  Taking a bad hit, bleeding, falling on the ground, dropping your gun, wild shots.  Could this game be less fiddly and still evoke the very essence of every 0.4 seconds of a gunfight?  I'm not sure it could.  This is not a fast game.  A 16 second gunfight will 30 minutes to play, but every detail, from cocking your gun to diving behind the rock to getting hit in the leg, falling to the ground and knocking off a couple of desparate shots as you bleed to death is played out in movie-style slow motion detail.  If I can get better at the fiddly parts of this game, I think I will like it much more.

I really like the concept this game brings.  But the scale of 2 seconds per turn makes it odd.  I have a suspicion of any game were you spend longer taking your turn that the real thing.  That said, once ou get used to the game mechanics it is a good multiplayer blast.  Lots of scenarios, loads of different characters and the AH standard DYO scenarios.  There is a 'tracking' system that allows 'longer' play but I have not used this.

One of the game I could bring with me on a desert island!
The best Old West themed game you can find ... no doubt.
It has all:
- Details: almost a simulation
- Gunfight rules; with a lot of weapons to choose from
- Brawling rules; saloon melee for example... a lot of fun!
- Campaign rules
- RPG rules; new concept as Fear, Respect ... a Career is waiting you
- Solitaire rules; when no one can play with you
- A lot of scenarios and you can build your own as well

As you can see is a COMPLETE SYSTEM but, most important of all, you'll remember for years the actions played "remember when I was about to throw a table over you head and you decided to shoot at me but your gun malfunctioned??"

BTW it is not so complicated as some people think ... you can start play all scenarios after reading 11 pages of rules (and the first one doesn't count really so you need to read only 10 pages).

I'll never sell this game and I own 2 copies.

PS. If you decide to play solitaire, use the expanded rules (adapted form the original ones) written by Steven R. Schacher that you can find here on BGG.

I love this game.  At first it took a minute to figure out the philosophy of the rules, and then it kicked in.  Great tight mechanics.  The definitive system that settles all of the little niggles of who was hiding behind what and did you get off the shot before he shot at you.  This game should be converted for figures.  Hands down better than any set of miniature rules on the subject.

--Dec2009-- I tend to like Hamblen's stuff.  This one I may have played years ago - but while it looks familiar, learning the rules is the order of the moment.  Hope to get a play before the end of the year.
--Jan2010-- Didn't quite make it (two "let's play with the pieces" sessions in 2009) but we finally got it to the table.  Other than the player-elimination thing (which I can live with) the mechanics are clunky but cool and the background color delightful.  There's a _lot_ of story in a Gunslinger game.  Happy to play again.

Each turn is how many tenths of a second? My impression was that Gunslinger turned an old west gunfight into an action episode of The Six Million Dollar Man. In my imagination you might have some guys sitting around the campfire (probably not aka Blazing Saddles,) when suddenly one of them reaches for his gun. Then a huge black hole approaches over the prairie, warping and slowing time, and at the same time swallowing any enjoyment my usually active imagination could inject into the game. While a creative concept, honestly, the game's just weird.

Ah, the classic wild west game, and you're still not going to get anything better. If you can get through the need for Avalon Hill to overdo the rules then once you put the rulebook down you've got a quick thinking gunfighting simulation that can be a hoot. Players program their actions for a split second in the future and then play them stage by stage. The whole shebang can move quickly with programming and resolution taking but a minute. We're talking quick games here where it's all action, action, action. Introduce a timer if you have to - this game has potential. Fun.

I've made up my mind.  I really love this game.  First few times I'd bring this to the table I thought that is was silly fun, but overall nothing all that special, well, I was wrong.  If you don't mind a game that takes a few seconds of realtime and extends it into    45 min of play time nor a game that allows for you to try not to bleed to death yet and get one last wild shot in before you go, this is for you.  The system is fantastic, while it is kind of random how everything turns out, there is just so much color to it that I can't help but adore it.  Plus AH added such a magnitude of ways to play the game that if you like the basic system you could play this indefinately.  I'm surprised that they didn't put out a medieval version of this.  Really, this is an underated masterpiece, and a manure-cart full of fun.  You'll be talking about you you died for weeks.

Critters:  If feel that perhaps the Critters' trampling power is way too powerful.  They automatically hit.  There is no reason to do a regular attack when you do so much more assured damage just walking into someone.

I recommend playing where standing humans draw 2 Delay cards and if they get more than two delay points they then stagger and fall.  If a Human is one the ground Trample is still way too powerful. Just draw more Delay.

Gunslinger is very, very, very detailed and tricky, but even harder to grasp because of the tiny font, triple column "rule book" (read: statistical list and chart assembly) and not "fun" as a solo experience, though it was definitely a "funny" solo experience.  Like Robo Rally and Space Alert, you program a series of movies and watch bad stuff happen.

My last game, I spent about 20 minutes looking at charts and pulling out cards and cross referencing as my opponent shot me, jabbed me, and (as I tried to get up) kicked me, kicked me some more, and shot me unconscious. So it was a LOT of work to be kicked and humiliated after 30 minutes of missing my shots and trying to hide and reload ... but it was certainly a vivid experience, which means something to me.

People are divided on whether Gunslinger works as a solo game--it comes with a solo system in the original box and my current rating reflects using that system, which works well enough to kill me consistently (if not unfairly), though it did get jammed in loops a few times and required "helpful interpretation" on its behalf (so it could then kill me).  I'll pull this out again some time, and I imagine with living opponents it will be more fun than it was opposite the inexorable (and sometimes illogical) A.I.

So my rating is applicable to solo plays of the original system and may change when I try it out in full and learn whether this can be "fun," but the admirable (if not overwhelming) details of aiming, aiming some more, sticking your head around a corner, loading, which hand holds the gun, the steps of reloading, the kind of bullets going in, the chance of a misfire, the type of misfire, injuries, getting staggered, falling down, etc. are neat even if it the game plays like more of simulation than a game in the solo mode.

RATING: 9
I can't help but love this game.  It is all kinds of clunky, it has cross-referencing of tables everywhere, the art is spartan, but it is one heck of a design.

Like Kremlin, the demand placed on the players is to accept the game as it is, and not be overly concerned about the elegance of how it all works.  This is different from many of the newer designs of this decade, which sometimes go to great lengths to get you to like them (plastic bits, high quality card art, "simple yet deep" mechanics, high tactile emphasis).  Throw all that out the window, and allow yourself to get into the game, and Gunslinger is a richly rewarding experience.  It demands that you like it for what it is, and to be patient with how it moves along.  Like Kremlin, how the theme is integrated into the experience surpasses nearly all more modern games. 

Gunslinger is not a strategy game, and the best players don't always win.  Gamers who don't appreciate a small amount of role-playing in their games, or those who avoid games that don't place much emphasis on playing "better" than their opponents will likely despise Gunslinger.  Gunslinger is about trying to see the dust rise from a foe's body crumpling to the ground.  It is about swinging as hard as you can at an enemy in a bar fight that spilled out into the back alley, only to have your fist miss his jaw and hit his arm, causing minimal damage.  It is about Indians running hokahey across the back of a shed, axe raised, straight for an old prospector who trespassed two days ago.

It is hard to pick up and play, nearly impossible actually.  It is not very accessible, and most likely will not play well in most gaming groups.  The rules are labyrinthine, the components are true to 1981, and the game is chock full of "stop and look this up" moments--the flow is not one.  

But as a game, as something one does to pass time and escape, as entertainment in its truest, most raw sense, it is unparalleled.

OK, should have bought this over Cowboys: The Way of the Gun years ago.  This is much more my speed -- crunchy, detailed, at times savage and brutal.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Only played solo.

Very well done, but I need to play more to get comfortable with the system.

Plays well solitaire, but I imagine it is a blast with other people. 

Update:  Fantastic game!  If you like the Old West and you like immersive simulation, then this is an amazing game.

The rules are dense, especially compared to today's Euros, but they really are laid out extremely well and they allow you to learn a few rules, play and then learn more.

Once you've got the system down it actually is more streamlined than you'd think.

This truly is one of the best games I've ever played. 

Update:  I have since played this several more times with 2-7 players.  The rating stays at a 10.

I wrote before that the rules are dense but laid out well.  That is still true, but what is also true is that there really are not that many rules if you are just gunfighting and only a few more if you bring in brawling.  All of the extra density comes from bringing in extra features like second stories on buildings, complicated LOS, hunting rules, horseback riding and some of the RPG or RPG-like additions to the game.  You really can get this up and running with a new player in 20 minutes without brawling if you use pre-prepared character sheets and know the rules well.

As an aside, people always seem to want to play the 4th Scenario: Thieves Fall Out when teaching this.  I understand the reason as people can start shooting right away (and LOS and Head rules are avoided).  I think some of the fun and narrative are missed when using this scenario.  

Starting people in a small town and having them get themselves into a good position, countering another gunfighters moves, etc. really creates a story and lets the game shine.  It lets people have a fun old-west-movie kind of gunfight.  

And, yes, when teaching this game I always leave out brawling until later.   




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1

Great programming game with a great theme. There might be better games out there, that have more fine-tuned rules (these are Avalon Hill - say no more), and more well-developed game mechanics ... but for nostalgic reasons, and because it simply is fun to play, I still love this game.

This is probably the most thematic game I've ever played; all the chrome really added to the experience, and the tension reminded me of what I think Leone wanted me to feel at the end of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. (That's right, I love this game even though I don't like westerns.) There's also a ton of game in here; the number of scenarios and different ways to play make this a game I don't think I would tire of. The points are lost because every time I've played, something really wacky happened with cards, and even though it's thematic, as a modern gamer, it bothers me a little. However, I've only played twice, so the rating may rise as time goes on.

One of the best games, ever. Brilliantly cinematic, and wonderfully tense. Works equally well with player numbers from 2 to 6, or even more.

The rules are somewhat dated and the mechanics could use some tweaking but I finally got a copy of this game which I've been wanting to add to my collection now for years.  Though I like the simplicity of Worthington's Way of the Gun, I like the detail embedded in this game as well.

Very good condition. Haven't played it yet but will consider trading only for something rare or multiple games of quality.

While a lot of work to play, unlike many other detailed AH wargames this one pays off in play value. One of my all-time favorites and most-played games. Best played in a group. Some online play.

Thinking back on this game made me realize how much it saw the table between 1985 and 1990.  Loved playing out the "historic" gunfights included in the rulebook, as well as drawing out my own from movies and television (I still have the character cards for the main cast of Silverado that I played for a summer).  A gem of a game.

This is basically a miniatures game.  It's too bad it was published at a time when cardboard was the main thing.  It has drama and tension that other miniatures games don't have.  Playing it feels like being in the middle of the slow motion scene at the end of the movie "The Long Riders."  In fact, this is by far the most cinematic game on man to man fighting that I've ever played.

Similar to Robo-Ralley - Great for Role-playing and campaigns.  Slightly rules-heavy but loads of fun.

What can I say...bang bang, you're dead - and so am I.
Absolutely perfect.

Great fun. Very thematic. Rules are a bit tricky, but worth the time. Very brutal, as you can be killed at a moments notice, and then you watch. good in a gamenight environment where there are other games you can jump into after you are dead.

Whoooooooooo *me* wanted this badly...
and I finally got a copy *gloat*

Everything seems ready to play, just the rules to tackle. Should be doable ;)

In the game you pick up a gun, point it at an opponent, and try to kill them (in plotted detail that makes Roborally look tame).  The best game to play when you want revenge against the people that annoy in other games.  I'm particular adept at getting others to stumble into a well.

(Trade Interest: low) extremely fine detail in a western shootout game.  it plays well with two, and i'd like to definitely try it with more.  the scenario based system works well, and the card based movement and actions system is accurate.  the random shot cards are sometimes frustrating, but then again, so is shooting at someone and having them shoot back.

Gunfighting in the wild west.  A more complicated, but certainly fun game if you're willing to devote the time

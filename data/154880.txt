Vudù is an italian party game with a fun theme (lighthearted voodoo magic tournament), where dice are ingredients for spells, cards are curses and a "real" voodoo doll is included inside the box!

Curses are cast on other players to gain points, and force them to act in weird ways: playing with crossed fingers or with a hand on the head or... whatever else.
If a cursed player breaks one of the curses, the caster gains some extra point...

Wrapping it up: it is definitely fun game for kids, and an awesome drinking game!

LOVE!!! This game is so much fun. Great quality cards. Cute little voodoo doll that you pass along to mark who first player is. Nice flavor on the cards and especially super fun instructions to follow. Definitely need willing participants to play though or it isn't fun.

A fun little party game! Makes people step out of their comfort zones to do strange stuff. Makes people smile and a few LOLs come once in a while. That is what party games are all about; FUN! 
Edit; gets really boring after few plays and not all are willing to come out of their shelf to participate. Lowered to 6.

On est un sorcier vaudou et on lance des malédictions sur les autres joueurs. Les malédictions sont des gages, qui rapportent des points de victoire (PVs) quand ils sont lancés mais aussi quand le joueur oublie son gage. Les malédictions demandent des composantes, qui doivent être obtenues aux dés. Le twist par rapport à elixir : les gages sont moins chiants et, aussi, quand on gagne on se chope des malédictions permanentes à assumer jusqu'au bout de la partie, ce qui est drôle. Bien vu.

Party game con meccanica delle penitenze.
Titolo molto simpatico da giocare preferibilmente in una serata "ignorante" e persone dispose a mettersi in gioco.
La durata del gioco dipende infatti da quanto i giocatori sono disposti a sopportare ed eseguire le maledizioni, le quali ti fanno fare punti sia durante il lancio, sia quando il bersaglio decide di spezzarla.
Molto consigliato ai neofiti, ma non per tutte le serate/giocatori

The cards are very funny and also the idea of the ability tests. But in the long run players tends to lose the target of this game and only laugh at the ability "curses". For this, in the long run the play gets boring and loses his magic.

Everytime I played this with other people we had a great time. Remembering all the curses played on you is quite a fun experience. It is also a nice addition to hear your friends imitate various animal sounds while standing on one leg.

If you want to have fun, if you want to let your friend cursed in strange positions, if you want to laugh, scream, sing and make strange noise making all the people around looking at you astonished (it happened, and was great!), if you like all I said before that's the game for you!

Dopo aver passato un'oretta con le braccia distese, perché vittima di una maledizione e tra un gracchiare e uno squittire ho battezzato VUDU come un gioco molto lontano dai miei gusti. Certo, con la giusta compagnia, con il giusto spirito, comprendendone le finalità e tutto quello che volete il gioco potrebbe anche divertire, ma per i miei gusti personali questo nuovo party game di Francesco Giovo e Marco Valtriani dopo pochi minuti di gioco mi ha già stancato.

RATING: 7.75
Such a fun party game with the right gaming group. Placing ridiculous curses on your friends is so entertaining. As the game proceeds you end up with multiple curses that really makes for some humorous situations. For example, we had one person afflicted with curses that made him speak as an aristocrat in falsetto while yelling Bansai and chastising players with lower scores than his own all the while keeping his head laying on the table. We were in tears watching him try to attempt jumping in place when the next curse was cast. I will say this game would not be good if your friends do not get into the dramatic spirit of the game. It will also not be as fun with few players. We had seven and it was perfect for this size group. On the downside the scoring track is contained within the box and it is a terrible solution for keeping track of points. The scoring meeples continually fall off and knock other pawns around so it is hard to remember where they were located. A small cardboard scoring track could've solved this. There are also far too few permanent curses in the base game, another dozen would've made for better replayability.

RATING: 5
I appreciate the idea, not the execution. 
The curses that force players to keep uncomfortable positions are fun: especially when someone gives up, unable to take it any longer.

The problem is that this kind of curses is rare, while almost every other card forces player to... yell something stupid before rolling the dice / passing the voodoo.

This makes the game just an exercise in memory and nothing else. Making the same animal sounds also becomes boring after the second round.

With different curses, this game could have been a hit. As it is, it's something that seems fun at first, but feels flat the more you play it.

EDIT it becomes much better with the expansions, especially with "Double Trouble".

Provato Maggio 2017 a mo di "prova". Confermo le impressioni che avevo avendo letto notizie in rete. Ottimo per un gruppo di persone che vogliono ridere e divertirsi. Non sarà il nostro gioco preferito ma è bene averne una copia a casa per ogni evenienza!

Bought and tried the game at SPIEL '14. We had a really good time playing this game with four guys. One of us had to cross his fingers and legs and I myself had to keeop my arms long.

Plays quick and you're in action for about 30 minutes. If you're looking for a little crazy partyish filler, this game is in the right corner. A little bit like dancing eggs (not that reaction based) or dungeon fighter (not that long).

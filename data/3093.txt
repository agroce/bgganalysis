When I asked my 13-year-old what score she would give this game it was a solid 10.  My score is a little more conservative, but I have to agree with her that it is a VERY enjoyable game.  Some call it a cross between checkers and a memory game, but that's only true if you play the memory variant.  And, honestly the only thing it has in common with checkers is that you can take an opponent's unit by jumping on them.  It really is it's own game.  I haven't played enough games to know if there are games out there just like it.  I just know that my kids and I really enjoy this one.  The design is cute, which is a real pull for my daughter.  The concept is simple enough that I was even able to play the game with my younger kids without helping them much other than to destroy their older sister.  Love this game.

(KIDS) Don't let the cuteness of this game fool you.  It's about taking risking and finding combinations of moves on the board that will get you the win.  There is a decent dose of randomness in unlocking the board, but my first play with my 3 kids uncovered a much deeper game than I anticipated.  This isn't chess, but it seems like a well put-together abstract-style game.

Good kids game, quick and fun.  The only thing that kinda stinks is the early leader can run away with the game.

Quick filler - lots of luck but there is the capability for some skillful play. Definitely prefer it 2 player (or 4, 3 player has the usual problems). Good one for playing with children, although french components are completely language independant.

Really fun with adults and children, easy to learn, plays fast. Perfect for family and non-gamer friends, also really good with gamers who like light games!! Playing with 2 or 4 is better than 3.
[Update] Upped my rating +1 because it just is a lot of fun!!

For me, this is definitely a family game that I play with my son, his friends, my wife and grandma. It is a good strategy game for kids that gets them thinking, but isn't too heavy.

Honestly, I like it too. I'm always happy when my son asks that we play a game of Croak!

Very nice little game this one - Chess inspired I feel as by the 8 x 8 board and having to capture the opponents queen. Bit of luck in what happens to your frogs when you send them out exploring the board as each card is face down and can either be good, bad or useful but once the game is set is a bit tactical as to how you trap the queen. 2 Plays.

Got it to play with the younger kids. The game pieces are great, but unfortunately nothing else about this game is. The older kids quickly figured out the strategy of using the mosquitoes to get extra moves and completely dominated the younger players.

RATING: 5
My youngest daughter had a very negative reaction to being "eliminated".  Granted that his pure conjecture; this is the first game of this type which she ever played.  Crao relies on several familiar concepts and mixes them all up in a neatly packaged with cute frogs.  The game itself is all cut-throat.  Too cute for adults, too rough for the 6+ crowd targeted.  To be fair, my oldest daughter was mighty proud of vanquishing daddy...

RATING: 4.3
This one needs a few house rules, IMO, to be okay for little kids.  First, we play until someone has "found" four froggies with the queen.  The kids don't get the concept of making new froggies yet, so we explained it like that.  We also don't play where one player can kill another players frogs.  If a frog is in a space the other players cannot enter that space.  That keeps a little bit of a tactical component but makes it less confrontational.  Lastly, if a frog gets a pike it is eaten, but the queen is out for two turns.  That way nobody is ever "out".  Our kids like it this way.  Eventually we will graduate them up to the real rules, but they are little right now.

Kind of a hyper simplified version of chess, but with cute frogs and a modular board. The 'basic' rules are far too simple. Anyone over the age of 7 should jump straight into the advanced game.

RATING: 6
A good game to play with children (6-12). A lot of randomness but fast and not devoid of strategy. In fact, a typical game is divided in two part. First, you move your frogs blindly and turn the tiles face-up : fun but random. Then, when a majority of tiles is face-up, the second part begins. This one is strategic. A good way for young player to discover strategic games with a light and funny background.

Vive la Croa!  It is back in print.

This game is enthused with the 'joie de vivre'.  Its light, fast and can be random but you forgive it because it is so much fun.  The game, however, is not without its subtleties - the wise frog can catapult themselves across the board with clever use of card combinations and victory favours those who play the odds and utilise the cards to greatest effect.  Croa is even better if you do your own sound effects, I would love a copy of my own as it would certainly become a favourite with my housemates who are all 25 years old plus.

This is undeniably a filler, but as a crossover between chess and checkers with a dash of random and a funny theme, I find it extremely pleasant in that category and full of tactical choices, deadly mistakes, move anticipation and so on. Fun.

Perfect for what it is; very fast (10-15 minutes), lots of clever opportunities with the mosquitoes and lilly pads, a bit of playing the odds, and even in a losing situation, you can make a last-ditch attempt at a quick win.  And it has frogs in it.  We like frogs.

(1 play)  With only one play, I thought the game was fun, and had opportunity for lots a clever and surprising moves.  Considering how it will work with the kids (presumably at age 6 or so) isn't as convincing.  As adults, we had a clever and surprising endgame.  Will the kids turn it into an irritating slog?  We might hold onto the game long enough to find out.

RATING: 6
I'm wondering why this is consindered as a children's game? Off course, in the beginning there is some luck involved as the tiles are still face down. But if the tiles remain open, you need some clever gameplay to make smart use of the different elements in order to eliminate your opponents playing pieces. It almost felt like chess, but where each square does something different instead of every piece that makes a different move.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a silly insubstantial game that while conceptially fun is just way too random.  The frog bits are awesome and the art is entertaining, but the difference in movement and reproduction is too heavily determined through random card pulls.  One player can have an obscene network while other's lose their turns.  Of course, the arguement can be made that the bad network works as a better defense, but when you can't reproduce and your turns are spent in mud or a pike's belly, there isn't much you can do.

Cutest playing pieces I have ever seen! Perfect as an easy to learn and light family game with tactical decisions. Likeness to (a light and random) chess, which is probably why I like this. That and the components. Cuteness! This one is definitely a gem in its own category.

Everyone with kids, especially daughters, should get this game with pretty frogs, even pink frogs! Shame on you, if you don't.

Not too many rules for such a large economic game.  It simulates the ups and downs of an economy very well, without being fiddly.  I love how all of the systems work together.  But once you have your region (engine) working, the game kinda goes into autopilot.  There aren't many decisions to be made in the last hour and the luck elements of the game become very apparent.  If the game was an hour shorter, I would be all over it.  (Well, but that's what [b]Black Gold[/b] is for.)  That being said, it was a Euro well ahead of its time!

This may be the lowest-rated game of mine that I'd be most willing to play.  I really like the experience of playing this one - the logic of getting the crude, refining it, selling it; the economic model of both markets; the mechanism wherein you can get a "hit" on someone else's turn; the amazingly cool bits - but the game itself is, well... it's just not that great.  It's really just multiplayer solitaire.  The color-coded dice are neat, but because each operates independently, "rolling" them really means nothing - there's no probability curve you can use strategically.  In fact, if you don't roll a lot of doubles, the game kind of stagnates, which is a bad thing in general, but especially bad here, as a regular non-stagnating game is already gonna set you back two hours.  And by the time you get to the endgame, you all get one final round to... what?  To roll lucky.  Seriously, that's what the endgame is - all that building and prospecting and selling and reinvesting and then... you better get that blue 6 or don't get to sell your gas station.  McMulti is not that great, but... as I said... there's just something to it.  Maybe it's the bits, maybe it's the puzzle-y quality of trying to "build" your little corner of the board - more likely it's the rarity of finding a copy.  And it's certainly unlike most other games, well, it *feels* that way, anyway.  I may pass up a chance to play this every once in a while, but more often than not, when invited, I'm sitting at that table, ready to play this arguably-broken, so-so game, hoping to roll my numbers.

RATING: 8
I think that this game appeals to folks that like a combination of American and European style games.  Need to balance the various aspects of a production flow.  First published in 1974 and does show its age, but still a fun game.  I think that in some situations the endgame can drag and be anticlimatic.

There is no catchup mechanism, so if you get behind in the beginning you can be in trouble and can be frustrating as this is a 2.5-3 hour game.  Unfortunately this means that this may not be very enjoyable for people learning the game.

One important thing to keep in mind is that you can only sell facilities that were activated by the dice that turn.  This holds true throughout the game.  I didn't think that the English translation was very clear on that point.

This game is underrated
It worth more than 6
it is better than many other games in the list with higher rate

The reason for that is basically because of the old version which was published in 1974, so many geeks are rating that version which is not good as the new one which was published recently

The closest thing to a pure financial sim I have EVER played.  The mechanics and game are absolutely fantastic.  The only thing keeping this game from being perfect is a solid ending condition and better control of the flow from player to player.

I really enjoyed watching my manufacturing machine do its thing once I had it in place.  after about turn 4 I had everything I needed to churn out the win and all I had to do was sit and watch it work.  It was amazing and fantastic.

I don't think the game is worth the collector price though.  There are enough flaws in it the don't make it worth the price tag.  I would like to see this reprinted as a $50 game, with some tweaks to make it more playable as a game then a financial sim (it took too long to meet the victory condition, and I reached it far before we ever got there).

I find myself drawn to older games, and newer games that mimic that old style. I'm not an Ameritrasher, and if you slap an X-wing or an elf on a box I'll have close to 0% interest. But thematic, real-world games that can run a bit long, be a bit random, maybe even be a little bit broken, but simple and engaging and clever and a joy to experience? Sign me up.

I used to think I didn't like long games... then I realised what I don't like are long, complicated games. Crude is straightforward and keeps me engaged so the length, really, doesn't bother me at all. That's a surprising discovery on my part.

Played three times. First two had events that pounded us repeatedly and made the game longer than desired... yet we all were fully engaged the whole time. In the second game, we had a compliment of four players and the game took FIVE HOURS! We got hit with event after event that crippled us, by the end we were getting repeat events. And yet, we were all engaged, and it was only after four hours did we start to think, yeah let's wrap this up guys. The third play had very few events and three players wrapped it up a nice length, three hours including rules explanation.

While the length may scare you off, don't be alarmed. The game isn't very complicated, turns are super quick and you can't help but be interested in what happens when it's not your turn. I don't normally like long games and I really like this one.

Events are negative and can put you in a hole early if they come out before you've prepared. I'd suggest a house rule to keep the events from coming out too frequently. We played that there was no event possible during the first two economies, and next time I play I think I'll also add a rule that after an event triggers, another can't happen for a while. The threat of event should always be there, but less likely/frequent.

Cool old school economic game.  I like the way you cycle through the phases (recession/rapid growth/depression, etc).  It gives the game a somewhat realistic feel.  Knowing when to sell/buy is key.  Dice aren't as lucky as they are made out to be.  You can buy from the markets.  Like to see on the next play if it ever becomes viable to sell to the markets...I imagine it would be if someone just can't get oil/gas produced.

Hogy én mennyi nem szeretem a tőzsdés játékokat. De ez más!!! Nem is azért, mert nem árfolyamokkal van manipulálva, hanem mert nem annyira a másik kiszúrásával történik a játék folyamata. Kifejezetten élveztem a játékot és bár utálom a kockadobás, itt mégis nagyon ide való volt, hisz mégis miként állapítsunk meg váratlan esemény változásokat a piacon, ha nem kockadobással. Nagyon jó mechanikája van ennek a játéknak és kifejezetten ajánlom. A játék minősége még a német verziónál is kiváló, bár én angol nyelvűt vettem a szöveg miatt. Sokszor újrajátszható és három játékossal is tudott működni a játék, mert az egyiknek el kellett menni a játékból.

Disappointing!  The bulk of this economic game is spent trying to mirror your good board locations (i.e. dice numbers) with the players on your left and right.  It's a simple buy low and sell high game that is full of luck from dice rolling and fairly random price changes (due to rolling doubles).

Roll dice, see who wins.  Awful, broken mechanics.  In the one game I played, everyone went broke on 1st roll.  We ignored that result, but before my first turn I was already hopelessly behind the others.  This is a game?  There appears to be a single, obvious strategy, plus dice to see who wins.  Going first was a HUGE advantage.

Also, some rules were ambiguous or outright wrong, or needed tweaking to make the game playable.  

Some great ideas and mechanics here, but the game is a mess.  Hated this.

Nice hevier style euro in the vein of power grid where you are working around a limited resource pool and things get more and more expensive as the game goes on.  However, unlike power grid towards the end people are pretty much doing the same thing and so if you don't plan well from the start you could be stuck come the later part of the game.

Rating based on one play of McMulti edition.  Liked it much better than I expected, random elements and all.

Seems to be a high luck factor for a game with so much strategy and that takes so long to play.  A single pip on the die in my final dice roll made over 30% difference in my score.

This is a game (McMulti) that I had wanted to try for a while.  I really liked the mechanics, and for such an old game it actually felt pretty solid.   Sure, the die rolls add a lot of luck to the game, but then again isn't oil drilling 80% luck at the end of the day?

I thought that the market mechanics combined with the item placement mechanics made this a pretty interesting game.  I can see how it certainly wouldn't be for everyone, but for some reason oil games just interest me, and this is certainly a good game.

Not sure if I'll purchase the reprint or not.  Probably not, unless things are streamlined and the reviews are good.  But, it was fun.   Initial rating a 7.

The bits are great, the production system is fun (rolling dice to hit assets on the board), and the economy system is very well done with how it changes up and down at varying rates.  The game runs too long though, it has one dominant strategy (sell gasoline), and the news events system mostly just slows down an already slow game.

Overall I think the game is fine and I can see where some people might enjoy it, but it does not appeal to me.  I'm glad Stephen reprinted it so that more of us got to play it, but I won't be keeping it in my collection.

UPDATE: Playing McMulti again recently, I have to admit that this a game that definitely has show its age (I've had to lower my rating a bit). It has fun and unique elements, and timing the markets and managing your pipeline makes for an engaging game. The luck of the dice is probably a little less than Settlers, although striking oil can be a little swingy. I think there are two serious problems though. Firstly, the game just runs a little long. It's not too long in absolute terms, but the last half an hour or so is probably too much. Secondly, there is really only one good strategy - start the game with a couple gas stations and ignore the whole refining/drilling game. The money to be made in retail really dominates the other elements of the pipeline. 

It's still a rather fun game to play every so often. But it's old, and it does show it.

A very cool economic game that's great to roll out once a year or so!  A lot of the game depends on the luck of the die, both for resource production and for economic conditions, but I really don't mind it here.  It's just plain fun trying to rake in the cash via fuel production and buying and selling infrastructure according to market conditions.

I wish the game was slightly more about playing the markets rather than rolling dice, but overall I still really enjoy it.

Too long for the few decisions it offers and showing its pre-renaissance age. Surprised this was reprinted. If you fall behind early on, you'll not catch up again. Covering an island in drilling rigs is a disastrous strategy. Instead buy a refinery and two petrol stations if you want to make money.

This game is loads of fun, once you figure out the proper rules.  Remember: the price of consumer gasoline moves up by the RED spaces, and whenever doubles are rolled, it ALWAYS moves up.  The first time I played, I thought the down arrows on the "Trend" meant the price moved down, but it doesn't.  It moves up.  Only played with 4.  Takes 2 hours with the correct rules.

An oldie but goodie. 

There are some elements of this game that feel dated.  The components have garish '80s color schemes. But the underlying design just works for me.

There is a lot of luck. You're basically making bets on the market, trying to adapt to opportunities faster than your opponents...and hoping that your bets pay off (via the dice). 

The luck doesn't seem out of place, though.  We've played with the rules as written, and with a variant that slowed down (evened out, rather) the changing economic conditions.  I prefer the rules as written, even though large swings can occur. I think it adds to the game's charm.

If luck in an economic game is bothersome to you, this is not your game.

The very definition of a seminal game.  Playing this now, in 2005, reminds me of how I felt when I heard the Stooges after having already gotten into the Sex Pistols and the Damned- that "oh, that's where they got this from" feeling.  You can see the design lineage of this game distinctly in Settlers, but also in other great games like Power Grid and Princes of Florence.  Why an 8?  Because it is, as a friend of mine put it, a little buggy perhaps owing to its own infancy.  The market climate mechanic and events are a little sloppy but the core system is brilliant, particularly for its time.  This game should be in the same strata as Acquire, and should be as widely played.  Yes, it has a very high luck element but so does life.  Plan well and it's not an issue.

Tedious. Tedious. Tedious. If I played again I would like to play with less players. There was too much down time with 4 players (even with your neighbours giving you extra actions). In my view it also had a lack of player interaction. Apart from the domestic and foreign markets, everyone was essentially playing their own game. I prefer games with a higher level of direct player interaction.

RATING: 4
One play - Overrated.  Much more random than even Settlers, I've no idea why this game gets so much respect.  People will tell you there are ways to mitigate the luck, but they are fooling themselves.  Roll bad and you lose.  

Now granted, my one game was described as the extreme, but it was painfully bad and slow.  The game only progresses when you roll doubles ... and we went OVER THIRTY TURNS without rolling doubles.  Resulting in an infinitely stagnating game.  One player missed out on converting derricks into oil wells over the first few rounds.  Why? because he didn't roll the right numbers.  And by the time he did there were several on the board and they were priced well beyond what he could afford.  There was no recovery.  Finally after two hours he asked if we could quit, and with no end in sight we happily agreed.

Given that this was an extreme example I'd be willing to give it another go, but my expectations are much lower.

With the reprint of McMulti in the store shelves it was finally time to bring this classic to the table once again. Back then when I only knew about 20 board games, McMulti was one of my favourites. So for me this game comes with a bag full of positive memories. McMulti has to be the most overproduced dice game ever. You get an ton of awesome components like drilling rigs, oil wells, refinieries, gas statios and barrels. On top of that the game offers a well working market mechanism that doesn't appear outdated even after 25 years. I also like the fact that although there is no direct player interaction, each die roll will affect multiple players. There is little downtime even when it's not your turn. Still McMulti IS a dice game at it's core: If you're out of luck you simply won't get anywhere. This is something you have to accept. If you have a problem with sometimes jut not having any chance no matter what you do, don't play this game. If you can accept the luck factor and like to play with awesome game pieces, you should definitely try this one. (This is for the Hexagames German edition (1988).)

RATING: 5
I already wrote a comment about the original McMulti so I will only address the differences to the new edition here. While I'm very happy to see this game reprinted, unfortunately the new edition made it worse in many ways. First of all, there is the new board layout which is not only incredibly dull but also very impractical. Whoever had the idea to place the die tracks in the middle of all the (now very crammed) component placement areas has probably never played this game. It's fiddly and confusing. Also the redesign is a very sloppy job overall. There are obvious errors in the rules (like the rules saying that refineries produce oil instead of gasoline) and just as to emphasize these errors, even the warning notices on the ziploc bags are gibberish. Furthermore there are rule changes (compared to the original edition) which are not being reflected on the game components: In the original game, changes in the economy are triggered by rolling doubles. In the new edition, these changes are triggered differently but the economy cards still read "Changing the Economy (Dice rolls of doubles)". This game really would have deserved a more thorough job for a reprint. Also I don't like the new rules: Changes in the economy are now triggered way too often making the domestic and foreign markets almost useless. On the plus side, Pegasus Spiele games tend to drop in price so rapidly that the new edition is still a great value for the 10 bucks (Euro-bucks in this case) you have to pay for it these days. (This is for the Pegasus Spiele / Stronghold Games German edition (2012).)

McMulti is, of course, highly collectible (used copies currently listed for $160 to a ridiculous $850). Sometimes I wonder if some of these collectible games are actually any good. Well, I really liked this. There's a bit of luck with the dice, especially in getting going if you're trying to strike raw oil, but it didn't bother me too much, despite getting screwed by it (16 wells--50% of entire space--no hits for like 5 turns). I'd love to someday find a cheap copy of this. I know, dream on.

Market simulation and dice rolling. There is some strategy to timing your expenditures to make the best of the current economic environment and avoiding event cards.

Interesting business game themed on the discovery and production of oil. Each player possesses a 36 space island, which is lined up along row and column with your left and right neighbour. Players purchase drilling towers, oil pumps, refineries and petrol stations and position them on the island. A pair of dice indicates which row and column have had buildings activated this turn. Drilling towers discover oil, pumps produce the oil, refineries turn oil into petrol, while stations sell the petrol for (usually) nice prices. Add in trading on the domestic and international markets, flucuating economies making things more or less expensive, a deck of events triggered by double rolls, and you have a very intriguing game.

Could be one of the best introductary eurogames out there... if it wasn't so rare.
 
A simple economic game of investment, production, and manipulating the prices of two goods. The price system was later used by Friese in Power Grid, and is pure genius. No trading, but great economic choices, adapting to the economic climate, and feeling the hit from random events.
 
Overall it reminds me of Settlers of Catan without the trading, as you stake out areas, upgrade your holdings, and try to squeeze out a victory. 
 
Long overdue for a reprint, if someone could only dig up the piece molds from god-knows-where...

An oil-drilling game that uses the luck of the dice in a fairly thematic fashion, as you hope your oil rigs will strike black gold.   Or, you can focus on refineries and gas stations.   You definitely are given some options that you can mix/match as you like.   It's a pretty basic and somewhat dated design, as each turn is rinse-and-repeat until somebody gets enough money to win.   Has some nice plastic bits, but the Stronghold edition has some annoying production issues with the graphic design:  snake-type tracks, and very important costs & sale prices printed very small on huge cardboard tiles.  It's almost like nobody proofed the game.

2014-09-01 : Normally our group is pretty good in figuring out economic engine games, even on the first play. But not with this game - lots of mistakes were made, lots of things everyone said they'd do differently next time. Not going to rate this until after a second play. 

2014-09-29 : Second game and the main problem with this game became clear : too few meaningful decisions get to be made during a game, the randomness is so high you just need to invest as much as you can and then hope for the best. 

Oh, and the graphic layout of this game stinks - so individual player sheets are a must - another point deducted

Huge disappointment. This game is really devoid of any real strategy. Sprinkle your area with some oil rigs, gas stations, and refineries. Then, hope to get lucky on die rolls. Throw in crap-tastic event cards that basically server to lengthen or shorten the game, and you've got a recipe for a yawn-fest that takes too long. It's basically Catan but you trade abstractly with the foreign and domestic markets instead of each other. There is also much less strategy here than in Catan. Ya.

It's a cool game and the economics and theme are tied together nicely.  There's just too much luck involved.  We were rarely rolling doubles (far outside the odds of doing so) and our gas prices were always quite low.  This greatly slowed down our individual economic engines and the game dragged on.

RATING: 8
This is an intriguing game with mechanisms that were way ahead of their time.  I love the way supply and demand is implemented in the markets.  It's important to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing, because if too many players use the same strategy, it will be hard for any of them to win.

The length and character of the game are strongly affected by how often doubles are rolled on the dice; doubles are like Federal Reserve Bank easing and if you go a long time without them, people start getting long faces, while if you have a lot of doubles, everyone gets rich (perhaps some more than others.)  The presence or absence of doubles also represents an important luck element.  This is not a game that will always be won by the most skillful player.

If you are only going to play this game a few times, you will find the fairly significant swings in economic conditions troubling.  On the other hand, if you play to play it a lot like I have (I probably played it at least 25 times before I started recording plays on BGG, so I've played it more than 40 times,) the occasional games in which you get economic results that are way out in the tail---lots of doubles, few doubles, or doubles that are unusually clustered---provide welcome variety and challenges.

If you have a copy of the English translation that says you move up the number of spots on the Consumer Market corresponding to the big number on the card, make sure you play with the corrected rule:  You move up the number of ***RED*** spots!

Also, be aware that some games have the gas and oil markets misprinted.  Regardless of the colors, the gas markets are the ones one which the prices go from 2 to 60 and the oil markets are those on which the prices go from 1 to 30.

Played at Baycon 2013

I was really dubious about this game but was pleasantly surprised and actually really enjoyed myself.

The random dice roll co-ordinate system for where you strike oil is really quite clever as it means you cannot predict and make a perfect placement each game, initially you have to build derricks and hope to roll where you have placed them. 

I bought a refinery early and so was raking in a lot of profits from refining and selling my gasoline but the other players soon caught up. 

The news events are really nice as they can be absolutely devastating when they go off however, only doubles rolls of 1,3,or 5 will mean they go off so that event that you are worrying about might not even happen.
 The changing economic climate is really nice as it means you can buy low and sell high however the values are printed in a very small font therefore there were a lot of questions about prices and the card got handed around a lot.

Cardboard 'cards' are really nice and thick which makes them very durable and the plastic figures are nice, they mention in the rule book that you are unlikely to run out but if you do to have substitute tokens available, we found we ran out of refineries and had to place 4 petroleum markers on the board to mark new refineries.

Looking forward to playing this again.

Surprisingly good game for its era.  Competes with the best games (Tigris & Euphrates, Puerto Rico, Dominion) for playtime.  Wish it were more commonly available.

The remade game was not quite as good because the change in the central economic scoring mechanism makes it so economic cycles are more predictable.  I would not give the new game the same score.

Considering this is a game about crude oil I actually thought it was rather fun. There can be a reasonable amount of luck involved due to the dice but I think it makes it more interesting. Trying to play the market to maximise your profits is also very interesting. It did seem scripted though (Player 1 buys 36 drilling platforms, Player 3 needs to do whatever Player 2 doesn't do, Player 4 needs to do what Player 2 does, with a little variation) which makes it seem like the game plays itself a little. It can stagnate if the market situation doesn't change as well. Still fun to play though.

There are things that I like about this. I like the uncertainty of the markets...but with a modicum of randomness. You can read the market but you can't predict the market. Sometimes the dice rolls are too finicky and the well prices don't seem quite fair, as it is not entirely thematic that the costs of wells go up incrementally with no release or upper bound, giving the early well builders an advantage. 

Overall, it is an enjoyable experience.

Interesting use of dice--at the start of your turn, you roll dice which let you activate buildings in the corresponding row and column of your board. Your neighbors can use the die that borders their turn to produce, which is neat too.

But to really get started doing anything you are going to need to get your lucky first "hit". You essentially are picking your lucky lotto numbers and putting out oil rigs on those coordinates. If you roll hits an oil rig with row AND column, you are able to actually drill there and start producing oil/making more money. And you could be really unlucky. Like REALLY unlucky. Meanwhile the cost for successful drills increase. Blargh. Not something I care for in a game that can be 90+ minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really this is the precursor to Settlers, released two decades before its more successful cousin. The best strategy is usually to buy oil from the markets and sell from petrol stations on your board. The exploration strategy is much more risky as you can only convert a derrick to an oil well on your turn, while refining and retailing take place on neighbouring turns as well. The news tiles really just slow the game down by taking money from players making the game a little overlong. A ground-breaking game for its day, Settlers just does the whole idea better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a little lucky, and it's a little fiddly with the math stuff, especially at the beginning. I wish the game included starting setups instead of asking new players to do all the calculations they'd need to figure out what to initially buy.  It's also a little long for what it is.  But if it doesn't go as long as our game did (and I've heard it usually doesn't), it's pretty fun for a classic and rather light game. (1 play)

RATING: 9
A classic economic game that's eligently simple, yet with great strategic depth. There's an interesting dynamic market of buying and selling your assets, marked with the occational peak of excitment when luck goes your way (such as striking oil or having the price go up right when you wanted to sell). Even better is that, in the version I have (from Stronghold games), the components are very well made and add a lot to the appeal of the whole package; with over 300 plastic pieces, how can anyone say no?

It's a nice combination of a building/production and an economic game.We played a 4 player game. It's a relatively easy game to play. Some folks may complain about the luck of the dice rolls (for production), but it can be mitigated as each person has their own play area so can choose where to build their equipment. I also liked the way that down time is minimized because on the players turns to your right and left, you can produce or sell as well.Would love to see a reprint!

I really like playing this, but I rate it a lttle lower than I originally did as its not quite got the elegance or coherance of a modern game.  It can sometimes bog down a bit if you dont roll doubles for a while.  Its got some good mechanisms though - the seperate board areas for players, way before Peurto Rico, and the oil/gas markets where the price goes up/down as the barrels are bought, way before Power Grid.  I'd still play this if some unsuspecting innocents wondered along.

It speaks for the design that Crude/McMulti is enjoyable after almost 40 years. Some slight changes in the new 2012 edition add a bit sophistication and probably reduce the randomness in so far as change can be planned for although it is too long ago that I have played the original to remember anything else about it than having fun with it.
The game structure is simple. First, a player can buy or sell goods on the market. Then, a production roll decides on economy changes, events and what will be produced respectively sold to consumers. Finally, facilities can be bought or sold. First to 700 million dollars can announce game end and everybody else gets another turn.
McMulti is a dice-based economy game and the dice will determine if you can win but there are enough investment / divestment decisions to be made that you can lose by your own fault. The influence of the dice can be compared to Settlers but there's no trading phase for players to compensate for an uneven spread of luck. 
Compared to modern designs, the game length / depth ratio is unfavourable and many players will be turned off by old-fashioned mechanisms such as rolling a double will initiate an event. In today's market it will have a hard time maintaining it's grail status now that it is readily available again as a new product and without nostalgia serving it. Nonetheless, it's worth playing as an economic game that has an amount of flavour and tension rarely seen in this type of game while not being brain burning in a calculational way.

RATING: 6
I was happy to finally get to try McMulti.  It was definitely ahead of its time, and it's a pretty fun game.

However, I don't see this ever being a title I feel much like playing, and will not buy the reprint.  There are a couple reasons for this.

First, the game is too long for its weight.  I understand that there must be some luck involved when representing oil drilling, but if the dice don't go your way there is no way you can do much in the game.

Turn order also seems like it would be really important.  The first person to realize that it's a great idea to buy up all the cheap gas on the market did really well, and I don't see how any future games wouldn't have the exact same thing happen.  So it would really pay to go first.

Received McMulti on June 2010. First play was a smashing success.  We played with the normal rules, although I discussed the variant for smoothing the Economic Situation changes.

Explanation took maybe 15 minutes, and the game ran just under 3 hours.  All four of us were very enthusiastic.  Count me as a fan.

For a while, I also owned the new edition.  The new edition has a couple of different rules, making it a bit different.    I understand how some games of McMulti can have wild swings of fate as the economic condition can flip at anytime.  But I feel the "fix" applied to the newest edition isn't to my taste.  The changes come a bit too predictably.

So I prefer the McMulti rules, although I do like the rule (that might be a variant), where you may only sell installations if they are on an activated row or column.

Good economic game, although a bit too long. The way your buildings get activated and also extends to the players on either side of you, is a nice and original touch. Luck of the dice is very important, but can be controlled to some degree. Nevertheless, it will be very hard to catch up if you are unlucky in the beginning of the game and a lack of cash flow prevents you to build a booming business. The game can drag when it takes a long time until someone rolls a double. Getting first to that billion dollars is crucial, as you have the potential to sell more infrastructure (after you announce that you have reached the target amount, everyone including yourself gets a last turn).

Despite the die rolling this is an excellent game. Buy Oil Drills, pump Oil, refine it and sell it as petrol.

It's not a critically acclaimed (best game) kind of game but I REALLY enjoy playing it.  Some suggested variants can balance out the random luck element tailored to a given group's taste.  With 3-players, however, I do not use a dummy roll for the fourth player.  Instead, I just wrap the numbers around (skipping the 4th plyr area) so that each player's roll affects the other two adjacent players essentially forming a triad effect (replicating the normal effects of a 4-plyr game).  This creates a triangle deal during dice rolls where every roll effects all players in a 3 plyr game.  Game flows faster as there's no need to roll for an extra 4th dummy player while still keeping the essence of the game intact, with one player's turn/roll effects two players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Settlers style production but each person has their own board.  As well, other players will only gain half the production capacity of the active player which was an interesting derivative.  The difference of the two dice drives how quickly the game shifts between economic stages and can lead to depression or prosperity or some stage in between.  Improvements can be bought and sold according to the chart on the economic card in play.  The different markets add different selling points although we ran out of crude in our first play as we couldn't get things rolling for quite a while.  This game is a bit dated, but I found it enjoyable If frustrating when probabilities refused to work for me.  

Sold after it started feeling quite repetitive and going for a bit too long in duration.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Crude is a strange mix of an economics game that has a Settlers like production, and better speculation than any other game around. The game revolves around the production, refining, and selling of the titular commodity. At the beginning of the game you are encouraged to build cheap, and then for the rest of the game every move is betting on what is going to happen next. Will you be hit with huge taxes? With the economy take a downturn? Should you buy new buildings now, or wait and hope the price for them gets even lower in a round or two? These are all part of the speculation that runs rampant in the game. Crude is definitely not a game that should be played by someone who wants to have a strategy and stick to it an entire game. You will constantly have to be reevaluating your position on the board and what your next three moves should be. All in all, is definitely a worthy economic game to have in ones collection, but there are better.

A love letter to oil.  A celebration of capitalism which may wrankle with modern sensibilities 30  years after publication (colonise desert island, cover as much of it with drilling equipment, refineries etc).  What no alternative energy system, conservation scheme or fair trade policies?  Forget it, the aim is to make money - buy low, sell high.  Fantastic entertainment for two hours.  The systems flow so well together and everthing works on sound economic principles I appreciated the design elements and with every move learnt a little bit more about the harsh realities of the oil trade.

Where the game stands out in my opinion is how complex information is communicated easily and player interaction is controlled.  If the term usability had been coined in 1974 then this would be the poster boy for the concept.  Highly recommended, this goes onto the long, long list of games I wish were reprinted.

(Played with the variant on your first roll of the two dice if you dont get a double you have the option to re-roll but must accept the results of the second roll - speeds up the game but plays a big part on where you position your pieces)

Interesting for the first 60 minutes, but then began to drag due to repetitive gameplay (think it took us 2.5 hours or so). Probably better with less than 4 players as the game will be shorter - I'd recommend a maximum of 3. 

There can be a fair amount of downtime between player turns otherwise.  Turns take a while as there is limited ability to decide one's next turn while others are playing.

I really like this game as a simulation.   The plastic pieces are great.  The game can go on too long though if prices stay in a depression.  Can't wait to try this again.  I just wish the price wasn't so expensive.  In some ways it reminds me of Settlers without the trading.

Fairly easy rules. Nice plastic bits.

I'd expected this old classic to play better, but our first and so far only game slowed down too much. Just because we rarely rolled doubles, which seems to be essential for the gameflow. Disappointing, because the idea is nice, the game looks great for it's age, and there should be enough tension rulewise.

Maybe I should just trade/sell this one.

A classic game that was well ahead of it's time.  Like many classics it plays longer than it probably should & players rely on favourable dice roles (although really the best managed oil business "should" win).

Players buy/sell resources from/to the markets, convert and produce further resources.  Prices go up & down based upon the current market, supply & demand.  (A mechanic borrowed later by Palmyra & Power Grid).

UPDATE: The game is fun and although there's little interaction paying attention to what your opponents are doing can be very helpful.

This is a good game, and my wife liked it too. Interesting choices for how to build your own little economy. Like the opportunities for razing all or almost all of your capacity and rebuilding later. Of course it is very gamey and far from a simulation.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first game. However it shows that this game is more than 40 years old; many aspects were later implemented (in a more subtle way) in other games building on this one. But that exactly was what made the experience enjoyable.
Would happily play a second time, although our game with 4 new players took over 2 hours ....

Others in my group seem to really like this, but I don't see the appeal. It's got some good ideas, but the strategies feel terribly limited and obvious, while the rest of the game just consists of doling out money until someone declares they have the right amount to win. It is a good looking game with cool components, though, and I'd have no problem playing it from time to time to please the others that really like it.

RATING: 3
I can see why some people may like this game. The basic idea behind it should  be fun. But I find it a bit too random. A couple of lucky rolls by one person and unlucky by another tip the game too far in one direction. I ended up not being able to do anything for about have the game because I got some unlucky rolls to start. 

The think the increasing price of the oil pumps based on how many are on the board is an issue. I wasn't able to build oil pumps my first 4 or 5 turns because of bad rolls. By the time I could, they cost $40 or $50 million. I didn't have the cash by that point so I had sell assets. Meanwhile, one player got 3 pumps on for under $50 million total. It think having the pump prices based on how many are on your board would go a long way to fixing this issue. 

The events seem to unbalance the game even more. Felt alot like Lord of Vegas, which is another game I dislike.

RATING: 9
It might be true that Crude (or McMulti) relies a lot on dice throws and suffers from excessive length at about two hours per play; nevertheless it's a fantastic, seamless simulation game, boasting both a rich thematic background and a very clever construction. 

As far as the topic is concerned, many different aspects of the oil market (drilling, refining, selling to end consumers and local and foreing markets, trends, external events) have been integrated into a rather simple turn structure in which players can purchase oil or assets and carry out actions after throwing two dice. These actions can be carried out on a quadrant of the board, in which one die "activates" a column and another one "activates" a row. It's up to the players to build their assets so that their chances of a good throw are maximized.

This mix reads entertaining but fairly primitive. Luckily there are two more ingredients that give the game a lot of substance: a ridiculously elegant implementation of supply and demand using spaces of the board (borrowed almost three decades after this game was published for the acclaimed Power Grid) and the fact that after a player throws dice and places them on his/her quadrant of the board, these dice mark a row (or column) to be activated for each of the adjacent players as well. These two elements respectively increase the importance of timing in a player's strategy and reduce downtime enormously.

Some interesting decisions, but still quite a random game. I played one game where no doubles were rolled for a long period, so the selling price just kept going down and down until no-one could make any money, and even when a double was rolled, it didn't raise the price enough to break out from that state.

First played in Spring 2007, then again in 2012. Reduced rating from a 6 to a 3. The game seems overly dependant on 1. Rolling Doubles (for increased demand, which randomly helps Gas Station players) and 2. Event cards, which are not absurdly powerful, but still feel like a dated mechanic

Cool economic abstract-ish Euro-ish game. Great pieces; tons of plastic. Good feel to the gameplay. Ahead of it's time for a game from 1974. Best with 4 players. Okay with 3 players. Bravo to Stronghold Games for reprinting this.

Games do take about 2hours. And bad dice rolls can add much chaos to the economy, and extend the game time. Rule book could use some work.

I really enjoyed this, though this isn't quite on the same tier with Acquire and Shark. 

I haven't tried this with 2 players yet.

At Nate's. Kenny, Dan & me.  Close scores (something like 152-142 (me)-136)

I went out first thinking for sure I had it, but other players get those damn extra turns & it burnt me. If I had waited for someone else to go out I think I would have taken it.

Seriously great game. Want to go again.

2nd game even better.  Needs poker chips though. Cash money sucks in any game.

This is a game I'd like to play whenever it came out, but I'm just unwilling to cough up the $100+ or equivalent in trades for it.  Maybe someone will get wise and reprint someday.

I played the "Crude" version of this game.  There are definitely some intriguing investment mechanisms in this game, but the way that dice drive everything feels a little dated.  Basically, the game doesn't feel very well bounded--the economy can end up in a permanent slump or boom (leading to stall as everyone waits for fortunes to change), and runaway leaders are possible.  Despite this, I was definitely drawn into this game, as it really rewards good planning and timing things right based on the economy.  Oh, and the components in this version are awesome.

RATING: 5
A first play with four players. This game is filled with randomness, which is something that is normally a big turnoff for me in a longer game. On the other hand, I really like games with supply-and-demand economics, and Crude has this in spades. It seems that players can take different routes to victory, but I cannot comment on the balance between these routes. In our game, I took a balanced approach, but I was the only player to build an early refinery. The consumer market ended up being great throughout the game and I coasted to victory. 

The friend who taught the game called it a step up from Catan, and I see where he's coming from. There is enough randomness that even a new player could be a grizzled oil tycoon. The components are over the top, naturally and it's a striking sight on the table. Will play again, but no need to purchase. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The first part of the game is rather fun, where you built out your consortium of refineries, gasstations and oil wells in an economic interesting period to invest in especially refineries and gasstations. 

But then it's a sort of dice fest and you just wait until you arrive at an economic period where your asset's value is high enough to sell everything so you can get past the 750 million. This last part takes too long imho and hopefully the events don't screw things up too much for you as there is for example a 'high taxes'-event by whom you have to pay $ 20 for each refinery and $ 15 for each gasstation.

For a game made in 1974, I'm amazed that this game is as good as it is.  However, it still has some of the flaws that remind you of the game's age.  The game and mechanics were interesting, but it felt very deterministic with single-path dominant strategies.  Optimize your grid and let the game play for you.  Not really a game you play, but more of a system you experience.

I was surprised to like McMulti.  Strategic placements of your equipment and rolling the dice for line activation was a neat concept.  The progression of the market, while frustrating, gave the game a nice little element of unpredictability.  Two things felt a little off to me; 1. Our game drug a bit as, at one point, we went 3-4 full turns without rolling a double. At the time we were in a very mediocre market, and all of us ended up strapped for cash. Relying on doubles for game progression could cause this game to overstay it's welcome.  2. Im not sure its good for the game if the player that triggers the endgame (1 billion dollars) gets a last turn.  Decent game however, and one I would play once or twice a year.

Hexagames version with English/German rules. Players build refineries, drilling stations (later upgraded to pumps when oil is discovered) and gas stations. The game is then all about buying and selling crude oil and refined petrol on the markets and trying to create a engine to process these elements. The game is heavily dice dependent (2D6 are rolled and places in a row and column to activate previously built facilities). The game has the 'real life' rich get richer syndrome and it's hard for a player to catch up once they fall behind due to poor rolls (a huge flaw considering that the game might take 2 to 3 hours). I understand the significance to modern-day classics such as Settlers but it's strictly for collectors only. Anyone want my copy?

I'm not really sure why I liked this as much as I did.  It is a multi-player solitaire game, it is rather long, a bit too lucky and repetitive, yet despite these things there is a real charm to the game.  The market system works and it is fun to get your infrastructure up and running.  This is close to Settlers in a number of ways, but as the buildings do different things, this feels more thematic.  There is no good reason for this to be out of print (although, it is certainly not worth the price that it is currently fetching). It's fun to watch the machine run.

We use the house rule where you have another die in the center set at 6, if you match it (or later match or surpass it) with one die you degrade it to a 5 if you match it (or later match or surpass it) with two dice you trigger the market change.  This creates for a smooth growth. 

This could use an updated version.

I liked the theme of this game, but our initial play was quite long for what it was.  Afterward, I found the entry on here about the error in translation, so perhaps on future plays this would be more competetive and fun. 
--- 
I just got to play this one for the second time, and I see a lot of potential for a fun game, but I think it will still take a play or two for strategies.  In this second game, everyone was scattered on where they were putting their money, derricks here, refineries there, and I think everyone was ignoring how to take advantage of the various markets.  Despite the groupthink that one must have pumps to move ahead, I think this game can be well-played and won by utilizing the markets and the economic situations.  Our game sputtered a little bit because of bad economic news, but I still had a great time with it.
---
Hrm. After a third play at BGG.con, I'm really starting to think that McMulti is too long for what it is.  I really like the theme, and the market fluctuations, but since one is relying on dice to produce the income and the economic situation, it seems that the game can drag on for a bit if the die don't come up on doubles to shift the market or change the news.  But, then again, it does have the crappy German wooden dice, which seem to be inaccurate anyway.  I think I'll still pull McMulti out once or twice a year if I can find people to play.

RATING: 7
The game is a race to earn $1 billion by buying and selling crude oil, gasoline, oil rigs, refineries, and/or gas (all with great bits). The board shows 4 6x6 grids, 1 for each player. There are 4 tables between the grids, 2 representing the domestic market and 2 the foreign market (2 crude oil markets, 2 gasoline markets). A central spiral shows consumer demand for gasoline. Players start with $200b, 3 barrels of crude, 3 of gasoline. In turn, make your initial investments and place on your grid. On your turn, first buy/sell oil and/or gas to either the domestic or the foreign market. Then, roll the 2d6, placing pink in it's place on the x-axis of your grid, and blue on the y-axis. (Double 1s or 6s result in a news event; all doubles will change the state of the economy, which changes prices to buy/sell equipment.) Any oil rigs at those coordinates have found oil, and can immediately be upgraded to pumps at a cost of $10million x (1   # pumps already on the board). Look for other hits on the row and column: for each hit, a pump generates 2 oil barrels, a refinery converts 1 oil to gasoline, a station allows you to sell gasoline to consumers. For all sales, the more you sell the lower the price (and vice versa). You are also allowed to sell equipment on the row and column back to the bank, at current market sales prices (determined by state of the economy).

We all really enjoyed this game. It has cool bits, of course, but it also works well. There is some luck with the dice rolling, but you can usually manage it to some extent. The economy also works well, so that some people might specialize in each of the important areas (pumping, refining, selling). There is a nice flow of goods, and logic in terms of supply and demand.

Sure, there's some randomness, but then again drilling for oil is risky and variable in real life.  I like the market mechanics, simple rules, as well as the race to a billion, which reminds me of Rail Baron.  Good classic gaming fun for would-be Jed Clampett's.

A classic. A grail game. An ugly box. Cool plastic bits. I'm not sure how to feel about this, so let's give it a try! Rules are not too complex and seem to offer some strategies to pursue. The initial investment before the game is quite hard on the first game, as you have little to no idea of what is important. But it all becomes quite clear as soon as you're playing.
I had three problems with this game:
- If you get hosed by the dice, there's little you can do. You try to spread your chances of getting successful hits, but when money runs out, there's not much that you can do but wait and hope.
- There seemed to be a rich get richer problem. If you get some successful rolls early on, you get cash to build more, which increases your chances which in turn... you get the idea.
- The game is very repetitive. Roll dice, collect income - if any - and do whatever is needed to optimize chances on your next turn - if you have the cash. It just dragged along a bit.

I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't live up to any expectations I had. And why I was hoping for a gem, I was expecting a playable but maybe dated design. And I think you can safely say that it is dated. But it's not a gem in my book. Far from it.

I finally had the chance to try this impossible to find grail game. Interestingly I tried it on the infamous version (for listeners of GeekSpeak) where Derk backbended Aldie's brand new board and broke it in half (and you'll be relieved to know that the game still plays just fine despite having been hideously vandalized). This was one of those game experiences where you win on your first play against an experienced opponent despite not knowing what you did right, and the fact of your winning makes you question whether the game is any good. I jumped out to an early lead due to some lucky die rolls and a lucky card that was flipped up near the beginning, and I never looked back. I'd like to try the game again, but the experience of running away with it on my first play against a far more experienced opponent sours the game a bit for me personally. It was an interesting money management and speculation game though, so hopefully I'll have the opportunity to give it another shot.

Excellent game of market chaos! It is random and strategic. Many people will not like it, but it has an original mechanism for production and a rather interesting setting for 3 markets that compete for your oil! Components of the new edition are excellent and add to the game play. This is not a game for everyone, especially people that don't like dice.

I don't know.  I kind of like it, but there is definitely a lot of randomness, and you have to make blind decisions that can easily backfire.  The bits are very nice and other players like it a lot, so I'm sure it will come out often, and I'll be glad to play it more, but it's not my favorite.

This rating is when playing with the straight economic condition change variant (which I helped invent).

Without it, I rate McMulti a 2.5; interesting, but ultimately broken about 40% of the time.  The reason is that if you have a long string of frequent doubles at the start, the Gas Station strategy will always win; if you have no doubles for a long time, the Oil Rig strategy will always win.  Only in the middle 60% distribution of the initial series of die rolls do you get interesting games, where mixed strategies can work (as well as the extremal strategies) and what you do within the game (as opposed to your initial setup) matters.

This is the problem that the variant solves.

Even with the variant, I find that McMulti doesn't quite hold my interest these days; it's just a bit too long for what it is.  But, it's worth exploring if you can find it.

(If you're a teacher, McMulti motivates Latin Squares very effectively.)

Clunky betting game from the seventies that feels quite dated in terms of gameplay and mechanics. Goes on too long for what it offers, but feels strangely rewarding when things work out.

I was so entranced with the really interesting economic system and interlocking mechanics that I totally didn't notice until after we finished playing how there is basically zero interaction between players, and yeah, that kind of sucks. Sure, players are buying and selling on the same markets, but those decisions are never made with the opponents' situations in mind. What I did notice during the game is just how random it is, even more so than Settlers, which I really don't mind but it does essentially shape the game. As an economics guy I am usually disappointed with economics in games but McMulti has some really interesting ideas which I would love to see redeveloped or stolen.

I got a second game in. It's really fun to watch the economic system play out, and there is more of a game in timing when to buy and sell than I thought, but my opinion basically remains the same.

Someone described this as "You don't so much play it - it plays you".  The lack of different winning strategies is a big problem and you do feel at the mercy of the game (and dice).  But it's still a game I enjoy in a mindless sort of way.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game from the 70's held up to my modern tastes. Admittedly they tweaked the rules a little to make this re-release play faster than it did originally, but I think even the older and longer version would still be an enjoyable experience. It does a nice job of creating an economic simulation with hardly any rules overhead.

The game can seem a little chaotic your first time through since random dice rolls drive all resource production and conversions. Once you've played through a couple of economic cycles you'll find that there are plenty of ways to mitigate the dice, including ignoring production altogether and just buying crude and gas straight from the marketplace. Experience will certainly make you a more savvy player, which to me is always a good sign that a game is not purely random, even if it relies quite a bit on dice, as this one does.

Even though it was once considered a grail game, I don't think it's necessarily a must play title. I'm glad I have it, but I think a lot of people will tire of the wash, rinse, repeat, nature of the game if it hits the table too often. Luckily, the rules are so simple I think it will be easy to bust it out once every 6 months and not really miss a beat getting back into it. That's a great attribute for a game to have when it is trying to hold on to place on your shelf.

If you like Power Grid and Acquire, this is one to look into for sure.

Good play can easily minimize the impact of luck.  But when everyone uses the same strategy because of it, luck still decides who wins.

For some reason I still like it, though.  It just feels right for the subject matter - random events and all.

Rating on the new Crude version.  Components are excellent with a bit of a map revision for this already excellent economics game.  Not that it was an issue in the old version, but it's also nice to have the event cards in English.

Played old version (Crude). No eye candy but it worked a treat. Takes too long getting to a billion so future plays will be over a set number of rounds or to 700m instead or something. A great economic game.  Have since bought McMulti complete with petrol stations etc.

It must have been great in its day. Now, pretty repetitive and too luck dependent for a longish game.

Some cool ideas here, but I think they have since been done better in games like Planet Steam.

This game is dated, but plays incredibly well.  There are a few things that probably would make it a better game.  Considering it is over 25 years old, it's an outstanding design.

This is a tale of two oil barons.

The first loved his family, tended his garden, donated gently used items to charity, and read poetry on NPR in the hope of uplifting the human condition.

The second foreclosed the mortgages of penniless widows, squeezed marrow from orphans, watched [i]There Will Be Blood[/i] every morning (because "it's funny"), and celebrated vigorously whenever good failed to triumph over evil.

The second guy is the one who invented [i]Crude[/i].  It's long, random, vindictive, and maddening.  It makes me wish that dice and plastic were never invented.

The moral of the story: You can fix up an old lady who was mildly hot in 1974, but that doesn't make her look 25 again.  If I could crucify nostalgia, I would.

Yes it's very random and yes it plays awfully long, but given the choice between this or Settlers, I'd choose McMulti any day.  I like the simulation of the oil and gas market as well as the dice roll usage as an indication of which of your buildings get activated.  However, I don't think I care for how the consumer demand always moves up regardless of the economy type, because the price there quickly outstrips the profits one would make as a crude oil supplier, so much so that it makes no sense not to convert most of your assets into gasoline and gas station.

Definitely could use an updated version and some refinement to the rules.

Played with 2 players. I did not enjoy this game at all. The decisions you have are binary. Buy low or sell high. Roll dice; resolve hits. Then buy assets in low economy or sell assets in a high economy. Rinse-repeat for 2 and a bit hours.

It's pretty boring with 2 players. I don't plan anything except not to buy any buildings when economy is high, but do sell them its high and guarantees money in the next round when it will probably be a recession.

So you end up in a cycle where you buy a load of assets on the cheap; try to get them paying out -- but when it gets high economy you sell your assets and then repeat the process; probably with more cash each time.

I thought the idea of having dice-based economy is going to be fun; its BORING when you suddenly realize you're really not doing anything.  Then just when you've done some actions; boom a random newspaper headline about taxes wipes you out.

The game is very dry and all you have to do is dont spend too much early on. But assuming you do this, all you have to do is time the taxes (because the fixed number of headlines cycle round) then sell your assets before the next tax and when its high economy.

Outside of the binary choice of buying/selling I thought there was nothing to this game and found it dragged out way too long.  Even for 2 players it took 2-3 hours and we weren't getting anywhere.

I would not, sadly play it again.  I would play Brass over this game any day of the week.

The game is a bizarre mix of mechanics.  I think it is really interesting how the different parts of the economic cycle affect the cost of buying and selling hardware and the how the foreign and domestic markets fluctuate.  On the other hand, the use of dice for when the economic period changes, which drill rigs strike oil, and whether you can pump oil, refine oil, or sell gas makes the game very random.  The guy next to you might be able to buy low and sell high whereas you get repeatedly stuck with buying high and selling low.  This really minimizes the opportunity for strategy.

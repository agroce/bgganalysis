Fantasy card game in the vein of Talisman and Mystic Wood. Superbly illustrated, but let down somewhat by inconsistent and idiosyncratic use of language, both in thematic and rules elements. Design and selection of some of the physical components could also be better, although this is more easily fixed.  Gameplay is in many ways a homage to those early fantasy adventure games, for better or worse, with all the randomness that entails. Fans of those games will like it; those looking for a more sophisticated or strategic game along the lines of Mage Knight will be disappointed. Perhaps warrants a 6.5 overall but gains half a point due to the infectious enthusiasm and dedication of its designer. May go up with further play.

This is going to sound worse than it is, but: GoK is a killer Talisman-esque adventure.  It has beautiful illustrations fueling a very thematic (and personal!) story arc mechanically glued together by word-tags and a breezy dice chucking resolution system. You'll be confronting various encounters (and enemies) gathering up unique allies, titles, items and spells to buff you up for a grand throwdown with the Big Bad. IIt is a bit fiddly in the amount of cards and terms. It also take awhile to play - allow for a few hours at least. But on the other wise, it's straightforward in very fun way. Another go-to for an evening of adventure. I like it!

I like the concept, and it could have been great, but I see so many irritating "loose ends" which would drive me crazy thematically. . .for example, it appears you could acquire the title of Executioner without ever having killed anything or anyone - it has no prerequisite. The infamous Doom Shield of otherworldly strength is discarded upon a single one-time deflection of as little as 1 HP. It's like a grab-bag of fantasy elements that end up tossed together without adequate rhyme or reason for my taste. The Sagas, while a fine idea, would best serve the game if they were less specific and perhaps applied piecemeal such that you're not having to squint & pretend their narrative somehow resembles what you've *actually* been doing from round to round. It's simply not organic.
Sincerely glad for the success this endeavor is seeing, but I'm gonna hafta pass.

Highly immersive game. Art is simply stunning. A little tricky to get the rules straight, but a few plays in and it really began to flow well. The narrative storytelling is very impressive for a card game, feels a lot like an RPG. I've onky played solo so far and it's been great. Good length of game time for a solid evening's entertainment. Would like to play with two. As a footnote, the designer Tristan is a huge asset to the game. Very reponsive and friendly and there's a great community.

This will be my go-to Fantasy Adventure Solo game. I very much enjoy playing Gloom of Kilforth and the art is not too shabby ;)
Besides, this is a true Solo game. That is, you only need one character to have a great experience.
Played Solo several times and each time was fun and different! To really appreciate the game one must play it several times as there are quite a few decisions to be made and several things to keep track of.
I also played a 3 player co-op and it was fun too. Two heroes got eliminated by the ancient and the last one won -barely!

2017  Beautiful art and solid gameplay.  Imagine the board, action points, bosses, and corruption concepts from Defenders of the Realm, add in Talisman exploration draw decks and resolution mechanics from Arkham Horror, add a Saga/rumor mechanic to level up characters and add quest and direction to the game, and then just jam pack as mu ch amazing art into almost 300 cards as you can pack in a solid box of goodness and you have Gloom of Kilforth.  The game does play longer than advertised (90-120 mins per player has been my experience.)

RATING: 6.5
Ugh, it kills me that I can't rate this higher. There are so many cool parts to this game: the art is wonderful, the "leveling up" mechanic is elegant and smooth, the theme is cool, the challenges are fun, and I love how you assign a race and class to your character, each following their own unique story. The whole thing gives me a strong Pathfinder: Adventure Card Game vibe, which I greatly enjoy.

The biggest flaw in the game, however, and what almost kills it for us, is that your number of actions is tied to your hit points. This means the worse you do, the less you can do, until you find yourself just sitting around doing nothing, waiting to heal. If you find yourself in a region fallen into gloom, you can get caught in a loop where you can't even rest, so you waste even more turns. The end result is too many "lose a turn" actions, which is incredibly frustrating and slows the game to a crawl. We need to come up with a house rule to fix this, because otherwise the game is great.

RATING: 6
A more mechanism heavy and somewhat overwrought version of Runebound 2nd Edition.  Ania's art is stunning, but that is the only standout aspect of the game.  I like how the game accelerates towards the end as players level up (more action points per round, encounters are easier to beat, etc.), but it is still a long game.  The solo / co-op play is good but not quite as exciting as the competitive game.

If you love Runebound 2e and want something similar, I think you will enjoy Kilforth.  If you find Runebound repetitive and a bit of a slog, Kilforth will not change your opinion.

Turned off by the washed out, desaturated landscape art, couldn't bring myself to buy this.  Too many greys, whites and tans. I like my fantasy games to have bright colors.

Like Robinson Crusoe, I expected this game to have blues and greens and instead the palette is dominated by browns and tans.  I guess people like this kind of thing, but I really don't get it. It's not a woodcut/scroll medieval style, so why does everyone look like I'm wearing brown sunglasses?

RPG-based, fantasy adventure card game.  Awesome artwork.  Can play solo, co-op or competitively.

I primarily play solo and this game is true to its word of being playable in an evening but it gives you a great narrative story as you play.  Just check out the session reports here on the Geek.

For me, Gloom of Kilforth recreates that feeling from my childhood of reading the Fighting Fantasy books by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, only with tokens instead and cards with awesome artwork on my tabletop.

This game provides a great challenge to complete your Saga and level up your character to fight the final Undead Ancient before all the locations fall into Gloom.

I am not really sure how this is supposed to play but we called it after 3 turns because we were constantly referring to the rule book for clarifications.

The game itself has no real way of scaling so one your first step out of the city you could theoretically find the toughest badguy in the game, and get bitch slapped whilst another player merrily skips about slaughtering pixies and fairys and small fluffy non-lethal creatures!

It really punishing and then it adds in a very restrictive time clock. Monster rewards are strange as when I actually manage to kill something, what I get what ...a receipt for an item the monster has in storage the other side of the map? 

The three turns we did play were an exercise in frustration as the rulebook is appallingly unclear, has no index and turns do not flow with any logical consistency

RATING: 3
I had followed the development of this game even though I had missed out on the initial Kickstarter.  After seeing it at UKGE 2017 I knew that it was something that I wanted to have, especially as it could be played as a true solo.  I'm not a big solo gamer but I love Mage Knight as a 1 player but I don't play it enough due to my crippling apathy and the huge set up time and the fact that I always feel I need to relearn the game.  Gloom of Kilforth seemed like a more streamlined adventure game that I was hoping would give a similar feel...  

Firstly, the rules.  I have been gaming for a few years now but the rules to this game seemed to come from a bygone era.  It was full of exceptions, exceptions to exceptions, keywords and side examples.  This did not bode well and during my first play through I had a creeping suspicion that this may be not be a very good game.  

2 more plays proved these initial fear correct: this game is poor, very poor.  I think there is a reason that so much of the marketing has been around the art, as the gameplay is archaic, derivative, random and dull.  This has to be one of the most disappointing games that I have played in 2017, especially after promising so much.  The issues are too numerous to mention, but some in no particular order include the double dose of randomness from dice rolls and card draws.  The reward system that is frustrating and dull, lack of character progression, action point system that strangled your ability to do anything, lack of theme and immersion beyond the art, some bizarre component choices.

To conclude, very disappointing to the extent that I cancelled my pledge for Tristan's next game, 1066.

I own two beta test versions of the game (first and second releases), that I P'n'Ped by myself.

My rating as been changed from 8.5 to 9 since the second beta test version improved the gaming experience.

Since the game is still experiencing an extensive playtesting, this rating should not be considered as definitive.

As a single-player / cooperative card game, Fantasy Quest manages to provide a very satisfying experience. 
The game-mechanics is rather interesting and original, for such a game. The "Artificial Intelligence" to be beaten does not throw at you endless waves of ennemies each turn like in Arkham Horror / Space Hulk Death Angel, as an example. Instead, in Fantasy Quest, you have a limited time to gather ressources, imbue your character with powerful Spells, equip him with magical blades and resilient pieces of armour as well as various useful Items, chase for grand-sounding Titles and bring together a skilled party of Allies.

As your character's strengths raise up, you will be able to accomplish more difficult Quests, defeat deadlier Ennemies, influence the most important Strangers and explore long forgotten Places full of knowledge and even more Rewards to collect...

Meanwhile, you will have to gather many keywords required for realizing your own SAGA, drawn at random at the beginning of the session.
That game-mechanic is very interesting and offers alot of possibilities. 

As soon as your SAGA has been realised, you will get a special powerful Rewards, called a Totem, that is very likely to put your character in god-mode until the end of the game...
Because the game suddenly reveals a boss monster awaiting to be slain... and the clock is still ticking.

Another time, you will have to gather ressources necessary to improve the odds against the malevolent Ancient.

The game ends in a climatic and epic battle very similar to what occurs in Arkham Horror when a Great Old One awakens...

A very good game, that is improving over the time as the beta playtest feedback is accounted for.

As a reviewer, I have the feeling that Fantasy Quest has the potential to become a great product, actually deserving to be published.

*Really* enjoyed my first playthrough, to the point where I could probably argue that my Runebound collection is nearly redundant now that I own this. I need to play this some more, but my initial impression is [i]extremely[/i] favorable.

---

6/18: I gave GoK another play and I'm not sure I would bring this out as a multiplayer adventure game. It extended to a couple of hours, mostly because I'd become more aware of the choices that I had in the game, which led to longer deliberation. This would have been pretty exasperating for another player, and I imagine turns would take a bit longer since the opponent(s) would be factoring into decisions and complicating them as well. Even though it abstracts a few things, like traversal, it's still the same basic structure as the old FFG adventure systems of yore, which also didn't translate well to multiplayer for similar reasons.

At this point, it doesn't stand out as an order of magnitude "better" than something like Runebound with a few expansions. It just collapses it down to a small box with a bit more variety than what a core Runebound game would give, and with less amateur art.

The abstraction of goals to card keywords also produces a bit of a figure-ground conundrum, where sometimes you see the framework of a story, but at other times you're just swimming in tag words and waypoints and trying to loosen the noose of the action point system which is constantly choking away your options on a turn. I enjoy the game enough to notice when I'm slipping out of narrative and can get myself back into it (re-reading my quest line & reviewing what's happened so far), but great games don't have narratives that fade in ways that require constant player investment in fluff text. 

I think the design is aimed at a pre-invested solo adventure game fanbase, which is admirable and it's clearly crafted with a lot of heart. But it also falls prey to some of the fallacies of the genre even while distilling & abstracting them down to a smaller package.  

That this game succeeds with such a distillation is frankly amazing, and anyone picking this up will be effectively "set" with this style of game for awhile. No need to pick up Runebound or Arkham/Eldritch Horror, really.  But for anyone who has already played these, GoK doesn't seem to go beyond what seems to be generic constraints and assumptions about what this style of game is "supposed" to do. It doesn't reach further to create stories in less frustrating or stifling ways.  It just makes them prettier, and more spatially manageable.

After one play, this seems like a step back from even the basic Talisman-type adventure games of yesteryear (to say nothing of the massive improvement in recent adventure games). At heart it's a scavenger hunt, where the cards you need to spawn may or not not be drawn off of a random deck--and then you try and dice to get it. Add to that an obtuse map and a death-spiral action point system, and I fail to see the appeal (past the admittedly very nice art, but even that is undercut by the graphic design).

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc d'aventures de cartes. El mapa es forma mitjançant una graella de 5x5 cartes que representen terrenys (muntanya, bosc, llanura, etc...) per on es mouen els jugadors ortogonalment. En funció del tipus de terreny on entren han de fer front a un encontre, que pot ser un event, enemic, etc... El joc s'acaba quan un jugador aconsegueix derrotar al "enemic" final del joc (s'escull al atzar entre uns quants).

No em convenç el moviment a la graella, em recorda al Pathfinder, i crec que té el mateix problema que aquest: atzar exagerat i poc tema...

If the game is any good, why the designer needs wife and friends to try to play BGG subsystems to promote it?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Gloom of Kilforth is a game built around an older model of play, with modern art and a decently balanced sense of foreboding.

The game plays at a moderate level- players can frequently win, and in my experience have done so near the end of the game time track- so in that sense the play is well-balanced.

The art is really something, and it's a shame really that the cards couldn't be bigger to enjoy it even more.

The sense of control is lacking- players need tags to complete personal quests, enabling the final battle, and obtaining these tags depends on cards encountered.

Players have some options about how much effort to devote to a losing situation, or whether to take on a particular (optional) quest, but the rules are not clear about disengaging from a bad spot if you have encountered an enemy that is beyond you.

It definitely improves upon the bier und pretzels randomness of a Talisman, and offers a better story than Prophecy, but it has it's own quirks.

I do not play much in gaming groups, so the Legacy and Interactive systems in highly ranked Fantasy adventures games do not draw me much; Kilforth offers something enjoyable to me that those do not, but I wish a little more development had gone into cleaning up some of it's little quirks.

Just reading through the rules, session reports and Dorg's initial posts on the different aspects like Allies, Titles etc tells you just what you want to know and confirms the above. I expect to like it a little more than LOTR-TCG as though it doesn't have deck building it has character building, co-op & competitive mode and probably a slightly higher sense of adventure. Definitely something I would have designed myself hence my interest is high, in fact its at the very top of my "Games I want to play list" along with WHQ, which is a HUGE list! 

Update: I constructed and played an early version prototype of the game with 2 players, game went very well overall. I did feel it was just missing a "little something", but I was unable to put my finger on what that was. Note that this usually happens with me with these kinds of card games though, LOTR-TCG and Pathfinder also gave me the same feeling (even Ravenloft did), maybe its my D&D background and falsely hoping to get a similar feel which of course is nigh impossible. At any rate I think fans of those two card games I mentioned will find lots to like here and be pleased with Fantasy Quest

Use actions draw card roll dice; bad stuff happens;  use actions draw cards roll dice and even more bad stuff happens; use even less actions (remember bad stuff happened), draw card bad stuff happens.  Next turn use one action to get one health.  Bad stuff happens.  Use next action to get another health draw one card bad stuff happens. Etc etc.  this is a short summary of the play through video that seemed like a mix between bad and tired  dice rolling mechanics and the luck and chaos of curly from an episode of the three stooges.

First impression is Lords of Waterdeep with more Waterdeep and less Euro. This actually looks really cool, and wonder how it will differ in play from Pathfinder Adventure or other living card games. The Arabian Nights angle makes it more intriguing to me than just another LCG.  Also wondering how it will compare to the Malaise of Deathkeep.

RATING: 4
A game that seems to have come to market about 8 years too late, this would have cleaned up at that point, but tastes and design has moved past this game and it's competition have exceeded it in every way. Sadly there is no compelling reason for this game to exist beyond looking at the artwork. 

Just too fiddly for what it is, and a lot of luck & variance in the game - easy to get screwed through no fault of your own.
Brings no new machanics, and after something like Gloomhaven or Mageknight feels like a mechanical step back in time.

KS 2016 arrived 2017
At last a KS campaign in the true spirit of KS!

Excellent game of exploration with many, many choices and excellent art work.

The random terrain encounter decks make moving around great fun (a randomness which can be reduced by choosing which type of terrain to move to, and therefore the type of Encounter you are more likely to get - stay away from Mountains at the start?). Easy resolution mechanics, but will not suit 'push your luck' competitive fans because opting to take on an Encounter which you might 'just' be able to beat is asking for trouble. Good choices at the start will be well rewarded - and that does mean running away sometimes! Working as a team to fight enemies will also serve to mitigate some of the more difficult enemies - and help get you started.

Get some gold and buying an ally asap works for me at the start - the bag of loot can be too random IMO so often 2 gold from an Encounter is more valuable than going into the bag. Later on it's worth the risk to pick up stuff.

Competitive mode is my current favourite and the automatic levelling up if you fall behind is a very fair mechanic.

I would give this a higher rating but for the fact that it is a much longer game than anticipated.

Disappointing game, but the art is superb. Its a flip a card and roll dice game. Feels like the only character progression is add more dice to your stats. If it took 10 year to develop I hoped it was more then that. More mechanics, more like mage knight

RATING: 5
Takes the Pathfinder formula and adds some additional elements. While those elements are interesting, they add rules overhead and make the game more finicky. The basic game is move to a location, flip a card, roll some d6s to test against an attribute,  and repeat until you either lose or level up enough to take on the final encounter and win the game. This game just didn't work for me. It feels too long and complicated for what it is. There are some neat ideas in there, but they're not fully realized. I really wanted to like this game and I didn't hate it, but I also have no desire to ever play it again.

Amazing game. Just can't get enough of it. Works perfectly as a solo game as much as a 4 player game. Will forever have a top spot in my game library!

Update: This has fast climbed to be among my top 5 most played board games. Game after game and it still doesn't get boring. Every time you venture out from Sprawl City on a new adventure, you get that tingling feeling of excitement. Absolutely can't wait for the next kickstarter that will have some expansions to the game in form of more encounters, events and rewards. 

This game has caught my interest on such a deep level that for the first time I have assisted in the making of fan-made content for the game.

[Played 5 times]

Decent "explore, kill foes, grab loot".

Overall, very repetitive (and since the enemies do not scale, you have some unbeatable foes early and no real opposition later).

Luck has a significant impact (so much so that the competitive version is "whoever starts well will snowball and win").

It's too long for what it is, so it seems better with as few players as possible (e.g. solo lategame, when you have to skip two full days to heal = you just turn two "nighfall" cards; multiplayer = 3 other players with 8 actions each mean you'll spend the next 30 minutes watching them play... not a pinnacle of game design).

The rulebook should have been organized way better (and a game with such a love for keywords needs a glossary).

Amazing artwork.

Nice enough game, rulebook and other things could be improved (the only game I've played where I can see multiple ways to improve it, many of which are easy / cosmetic) but it plays well enough. Doesn't seem to be that varied (the 4 bosses are very similar, the class upgrades have 4/8 that are useful with 3 characters, the saga endings are fairly similar: needing 6/7 of a different attribute). It also has that talisman thing where you get near the end and if you're character is built up enough you should on average flatten the bosses. Felt to me like I was playing a game that looked very nice (aside from the odd card) but hadn't been fully playtested. That said it's OK for what it is and the luck side of things didn't matter as much as I thought it would. A fun game that with a bit more testing / development would have been a fullier package for me. If someone's into roleplaying a game it could work a bit a better, but the core still needs to be there, taking 3 hours to force through the rules first time through probably didn't help either.

RATING: 5
First impression: It's.... ok. It kind of works as a solo game with 1 hero if you are looking for something that is less of a brain burner compared to, say, Mage Knight.
For multiple heroes (and thus for coop play) it definitely needs some house rules to make it work (why can the heroes not travel together? That is just odd and there is no way I will play it coop like that).

The map, while beautifully drawn, has severe usability issues. It is almost impossible to distinguish the backside "gloom" part from the front, and much worse the graphics design is so poor it is difficult to locate anthing.
Partial fix: Turn the map 90 degrees so you can at least read the location names(!)

There is a lot of randomness in the card draws. I am thinking it might be to the point where it could be impossible to win a game if you are unlucky. Whether this is a problem or not is a matter of personal taste I guess. I actually do not mind it too much in a game playing this fast.

Still I am completing a few games, and I might keep it since I have nothing else that compares to it.

Edit: Due to it being rather fiddly I realised I would always pick Mage Knight to play instead. Once your asserts start to pile up there is just too much to keep track of. Sold.

Not an overly tactical game. The emphasis is clearly on firing the imagination to conjure a coherent narrative. Highly recommended although I would rate this lower if I took into consideration the steep learning curve (the rule book could contain more reminders and a separate player aid is needed).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a brand new game still in development and probably the first some of you will have heard about it.  The game is a streamlined fantasy quest (hence the title and sorry for the pun) but yet is filled to the brim with thematic suspense.
It's playable both co-cooperatively and in vs mode and will normally take about 1 hour to play (without distractions).
Your in turn actions and rules are easily remembered, fairly swift (no fights which take 3 days and 90 die rolls to resolve) and after just a few games we were able to play without looking up what happens in certain situations.
There is a wide variety of classes, races and customization available in every game and although you don't level up in the generic sense you can visually see your character becoming stronger as the game progresses.
You aren't disappointed to find yourself with one class over another because the nature of the games and choices available allows you to win in a number of different ways and when the ancient one awakens you don't know whether you will have to beat it over the head, sneak around it or convince it your his friend - the point being, the guy with the biggest sword is not guranteed to win as with most games.
The game is designed in a way that lovers of Ameritrash and Euro's with both be able to enjoy it. 
If you like the fantasy genre and want something different then I strongly recommend that you check this out.
The artwork is currently excellent but unfortunately as the rights are not owned it is subject to change.

This game reminds me of a card based version of Arkham Horror in general.  The way you chase down objectives and fight back the gloom reminds me of closing gates and collecting elder signs.  The end game is different from AH, but still gives me a similar feeling when playing.  The artwork to me is excellent and an attraction point.  The game is very roll and resolve, but if you like that, fantasy, and the artwork the game is worth a look.

Box art pretty ugly. Interior art and component quality absolutely beautiful.
Rules are fiddly and sometimes poorly laid out or with omissions (despite the feel that TH really has put massive time and effort into avoiding these). Makes it difficult to learn and get into which has been a big obstacle to my engagement.
Footprint and layout messy.
Not enjoying this yet and struggling to keep going. I have to keep going back to the rules and trying to figure out what I should be doing and it interferes with gameplay.
Gameplay is move and roll rinse and repeat and the lovely artwork, night sections and character development struggle to stave off the tedium of the mechanism. 
Even with all the artwork and with the flavour text I don't find it that thematic.

KS pledged 27/9/2015. £50.
Arrived shortly after UK expo 2017.
Played a couple of time already and i really like this game.
You have interesting decisions to make, character progression but a finite time.
Rule book isn't the easiest to follow and there is a lot of detail and subtleties to understand.

4 games in.
Thoughts so far.  Cooperative version of this game is brutal. An Ancient per Hero really ramps up the difficulty. The decisions between completing your Saga, keeping the Ancient at bay or develop your party means every decision has to be carefully planned.  With 25 days for your hero to achieve all of this and with random encounters and dice chucking along the way it might sound a bit luck driven.
With ways of mitigating the luck and a sense of character development which makes you feel more heroic in the game, its a game that feels like an epic campaign that plays in an evening.

Conclusion
You have the makings of a challenging , story & character driven game with laugh out loud moments.
If you have the time to commit to learning the game, you'll be rewarded equally.

I was really looking forward to this game, hoping for some unique, smooth gameplay mechanic with a beautiful fantasy setting that had some depth.  Disappointendly, but still fun and immersive at the same time, I found this to be a that blends "A Touch of Evil," "Slaughterville," and  "Darkest Night."  Nothing really new.

There is good theme, but it's dice chucking with a bland success roll that's been done over and over again.  Also some parts of the theme don't really match due to art that is used to represent ur class/character.  I.e. playing as a Male wizard Dark Elf, but the standee is a female wizard which sometimes takes away from the immersion.

Provisional rating. Lovely art, nice theme but very luck driven. Nice solo game if you're prepared to spin the elements into a coherent story. Think it might be hurt in the long run by limited replayability of the place cards, encounters and ancients given the game is pretty much driven by a single dice mechanic. Not sure this would be a good game for more than 2 players given the luck-based nature of the game. Will likely stick to solo plays.

A really promising design. Synthesises a lot of elements from Runebound, Magic Realm and Arkham Horror into an involving, epic and (at lower player counts) fast-playing game. In its current incarnation, my preference is as a solo or 2p game, but could play well with larger groups, particularly who enjoy cooperation. Lots of scope for expansions. Publish this soon!

I am a latecomer to a squad of BGG playtesters for this game.   Printed it via Artscow.  The game is clever.  It shares some similarities in basic structure to Jack Darwid's "Adventures of D" in the use of a tableau of cards to represent a fantasy world, but the fleshing out of character types, classes, skills, etc. is far more detailed and immersive in Fantasy Quest.   The different elements of the game interlock nicely so that you have to pay attention to your character traits to succeed.   As an example of interlocking elements, if you pick up an "item" card, you don't really possess the item, only the knowledge of where in the game world the item is located and you have to trek to the location to pick it up.  So, you are constantly on the move.  Rather than just a grab at ever increasing amounts of gold, the game comes with a selection of over arching quests called "Sagas" which give real purpose to your movement through the Fantasy Quest world.  I can see opportunities for many expansions simply by devising ever more interesting Sagas to embark upon. Tristan Hall has a great design with this game and I hope it finds its way into publication.

Its not terrible and there's some neat stuff in there, but it takes a long time and has a high "slog" and frustration factor. Lots of time struggling to get the right card combos, then having to start over thanks to one unlucky roll. Rules are fairly bad, making the game confusing. Art is lovely, but text is often small and hard to read, and the player standees rarely look anything like the characters!

Gorgeous artwork and tons of replayability. The double whammy of randomly looking for specific cards and then randomly rolling dice to see if you can beat those cards makes this game too frustrating for me. I'm sure if you're not as bothered by output randomness, this could be a real fun experience.

Lots of fun! The keyword approach to completing each hero's personal saga allows players to fill in the blanks to create their own heroic stories. Excellent risk/reward system, forcing players to make very meaningful and interesting decisions. The night cards put the game on a timer, that seems generous at first, but as the world falls further into gloom, the pressure mounts quickly. The art is nothing short of amazing! I hope for an expansion!

Excellent as a solo game, full of meaningful decisions and the right amount of luck involved. Very good replayability as well, and can be played in about two hours. Art astounding. Mediocre as multiplayer, as it is basically the same game with not so much interaction when playing cooperatibly. Not sold on the competitive mode, the end game drags on as everyone is trying to prepare for the final battle, it doesn't feel as much as a "race". The rating is for solo play, which is the only way I will play the game from now on. -1 point if I had to score it as a cooperative game. 

EDIT: Ok, I played it a few more times now, which was maybe a mistake (I may have burned on it), and decided to subtract 1 point from my original score. Indeed it remains a weird and interesting little game. In a sense, It fixes all the bad things Arkham Horror (The Board Game) has: lack of meaningful decisions, no bad luck mitigation, it doesn't (usually) drag. But it has problems of its own: The character levelling is not so much of a choice since there is clearly a "branch" more useful than the other for every class (at least so far). There are some obvious Race/Class ability synergies which, if you're lucky and start with those, you will have a pleasant and smooth ride full of the crunchy choices I talked about before. But if playing "random starter options" in my experience 50% of the time you end up with a bad combination which, combined with (pardon the repeat) the luck of the draw in encounters you are at the mercy of the dice with no strong skill value to rely on. Even spending all fate you have a lot of false starts where you end up dying/spending too much time just to get started, which makes it impossible to win and is a turn off when you're, say 5 turns form the endgame and still haven't gotten your totem (I usually just end it there). Maybe I'm wrong and the designer has already balanced this and I just need to play more to "get" the strategy, but like I said, I'm a little burned out from these experiences. I introduced a little house rule of my own for playing solo with what I consider an unbalanced character (which is totally arbitrary criteria): I regain a fate token each time I overcome an encounter and regain 2 fate tokens when I die. It seems to balance out a little. The problem I have when the game doesn't go my way is that the "penalty" is like going back to square one, it just makes the game drag on and on (like in Arkham Horror), and it may not be a long game but it is not a short one. Also, I haven't played it multiplayer again, I'm still to try coop, but for some reaseon I think that the same things that make this game so much better than Arkham as a Solo experience, make it worse as a "party game" (the only way to play Arkham right is to not take it seriously), So not particularly looking forward for multiplayer in the near future. So, all in all, I still enjoy it but maybe I'll put it to sleep until the expansion comes out. Oh, and definetely play it in a large surface.. This game should have a Playmat ala Legendary to organize everything, otherwise the feeling of chaos makes me more down.

This looks pretty good! 
I didn't back the Kickstarter because of funds, I've a lot of dungeon crawl games already, and it looks just a taaaddd fiddly for my tastes. Whereas I don't mind a few fiddly games, I do want to keep my collection balanced with simpler ones too.
Once upon a time I "had to" have this. Not quite so much now, but still interested.

Solo - gorgeous artwork and perfect playtime once familiar with rules. Enough variety to keep multiple plays interesting and feels well balanced. Weak and helpless at the beginning, 25 days later wiping enemies from the land in one swoop. Looking forward to even more content being added

[Note this is merely my opinion]  GoK is a very pretty card based dice chucker with a fantasy quest theme. You gad about from card to card with limited actions per turn throwing dice against a target number to either battle, sneak or reason encounter cards into your hand. There's a nice rewards choice mechanic on each card (advance plot or potentially get bonuses giving you more dice to chuck). If you don't like random dice rolling this game is definietly not for you. I love random dice throws, Runebound 2nd edition being my go to fantasy quest game, and there is choice of which stat to roll against (affecting how many dice you throw) with each encounter. The titular 'Gloom' is a timer mechanic where each turn one of the 25 randomly placed locations gets flipped to a nearly identical supposedly 'gloomy' looking side which is harmful to your character. It's a fun enough game that uses a good random card placement and keyword collection mechanic. It is a bit abstracted with the collection of needed keywords as opposed to specific goals but if you let your imagination run a bit a nice enough fantasy story develops. To me it plays like a Fighting Fantasy gamebook but without the text, just the encounters. That's not necessarily a bad thing and I did enjoy my game. Is it worth £50, hmm, not in my humble opinion, there are better quest themed card games at a lower price point with multiple expansions already out and many of those don't rely so heavily on random dice rolls.

Hits a LOT of sweet spots for me, from art to well-crafted subsystems that gel really well. It plays relatively quickly, which is quite a feat for a game with epic scope. With a wide breadth of options - both tactically and strategically - it feels like Mage Knight without the neverending setup and teardown, and with far fewer confusing bits to screw up in the middle.

This game sets out to distil an epic fantasy RPG into a game playable in under 2 hours. In this, it succeeds magnificently

This game might just be everything I've been looking for in an adventure game. Among my favorites are Mage Knight, LoTR the Card Game, and Arkham Horror (both board and card game). This sets up faster than those but still has all the depth and flavor. 

Everything about the game is gorgeous. It's fun and you really feel you're going on a grand adventure. I'm dying to get more play throughs.

A "fastest Mage Knight". I enjoyed it a lot, but i played it only in solo mode.
The Play time, in solo mode, has been around three hours.

Very fun epic-feeling game that plays in about an hour per player ---- once you know the rules well.  Fantastic for solo.  Has a heavy Eldritch Horror "feel" to it -- roll dice to test a skill and succeed on 5+.  Love the Sagas that give it a "personal quest" vibe.  The encroaching Gloom adds great tension and strategic decision-making.  Considering the amount of randomness, there is a lot of room to improve your strategic play.  Very happy to have KS'd this.

Had a great time playing this at Airecon. It's got adventure, excitement, peril ( lots of big scary peril) , murder of the innocent, shovels, and most importantly, the suggestion of ponies. Everyone should give this a go. Excellent fantasy game with gorgeous artwork

Very nice adventure themed card game. I esp. like the idea of the "hero's journey".
Needs some finetuning, but for a self-developed, self "designed", self published, non-professional game outstanding.

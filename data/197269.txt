I have played with its basic game and used viaration rules. But also play it alone. No doubt it's a great game. I enjoy it very much.

I so badly want to rate this an 8; it's clever, compact and well-paced. But both times I've played it, there was a runaway winner like whoa.

If making a comeback is as difficult as it seems, then this game, despite being pleasingly short for a mid-weight civ builder, is way too long.

I fell behind in the second age I think and it was *really* hard to catch up after that. Did okay because I had the Espionage card, but this game can be very unforgiving.

Played once. Very interesting, but hard to fathom just yet. I think the changes from the first Guns & Steel (different way of getting wonders, and no longer risk having them stolen, and more non-attack interaction cards) are all improvements, but it felt harder to get going economically. Have to play again to form a real opinion.

Not as good as the base game. This one changed up some of the rules by adding point tokens you can acquire, as well as making it so wonders are built over time rather than all at once. The point tokens are fine. I understand that military cards are almost vital to winning in the base game, but the Renaissance theme makes more sense to have non-military paths to victory. The change to the wonders aren't something I'm a fan of though. It adds to the fiddliness of the game, and there's usually no sense on working on a wonder if someone else is already. The game also comes with rules to combine sets, but I dislike the fact that you have to use the new wonders. It's nice to have alternate cards to keep each game a little different, but on its own, I wouldn't keep Guns & Steel: Renaissance.

Based on one play: There is a pyramid of cards that you can buy, which are the same in every game and you use your cards as either ressources or actions to gain new cards that give you better abilities. Points are acquired in three ways: from actions taken, from cards and from obtaining special achievement. It is one of those engine games that can end quickly so keep your eye on th prise and don't fall for the standard pitfall of over growing your engine.

--Oct2016-- It's interesting.  Player interactions are different; combat not quite as swingy - and yet other interactions are higher touch.  I might like this better than the original.

Too mechanical. But could have done much more with it's cool system.

:) Does a lot with a little deck of cards
:) Tough decisions to make
:) Cool pyramid tech tree

:soblue: Ends too fast with expansion. Should be 2 end conditions.
:soblue: No rules for base game wonders
:soblue: Lack of variety

I play with both sets combined (Renaissance and the original G&S.)  Very thinky and "tight-feeling" game.  Favors short-term tactics over long-term strategy, although both are factors.  At its best after several plays as one learns the cards, the various paths to victory and the key concepts to avoid an early defeat.  Despite having few components and relatively simple rules, this may not be a great casual game - there are few catch-up mechanisms, so experienced players will be at an advantage vs. newer players.  Also contains a moderate level of direct player interaction, mostly in the form of "take that"-type conflict.  If, like me, you consider these aspects to be strengths and not flaws, then I recommend the game.

The additional paths to victory created by the Culture Token mechanic added in G&S: Renaissance enhance my enjoyment of the game.  I would be very interested in another expansion, to add even more variety.

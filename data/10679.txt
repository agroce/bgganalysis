RSS - Definitely will be converting this to LoB rules for the campaign. I've played the opening attack scenario but did not take into account the updated movement rules....

The most accessible RSS game to date (though the forthcoming South Mountain will be even smaller, at one map). The system is simple, but achieves precisely what it aims to achieve.

This is perhaps not the most enthralling ACW battle - the terrain is very restrictive, and the generally poor quality of troops can make it frustrating. But it's a challenge, and a very different feel to the more experienced armies found at Gettysburg and Chickamauga. 

A big plus to this game is the variety it provides. The basic battle would probably not be one with a high replay value, but there are a multitude of options for both sides. If you have the time, the interest, and the space, it's a must. If not, well, it'll probably appreciate in value when it goes out of stock at MMP.

Part of the Civil War Brigade Series (CWBS) with additional rules known as the Regimental Sub-Series (RSS).  There are four games that use the CWBS system with regiments instead of brigades (making the game much longer and more detailed).  I would like to get this game played at some point, but even the VASSAL Player Competitor's Directory Geeklist is difficult to find players.  I've e-mailed several people with no responses.

09/23/10 - Update.  Began my first game of this about a week ago PBEM.  The RSS looks awesome, and I'm now looking forward to LOB.

03/12/11 - Update.  Finished one small scenario (the intro) with petegs from Australia.  We then started the Prentiss Attacked! scenario, got about half way through it, and Pete had to beg off due to family obligations.  Definitely will be looking for an opponent for one of these CWBS games.

The RSS is a great little add on system, but I suspect that this installment of the RSS is a bit fiddly for the full campaing.  LOS is a nightmare on this game's map, with elevation changes, fences, forests, marshes, and thickets all combining into a gob of goo in my brain when trying to decipher whether an arty unit has LOS.  That being said, I LOVE this series, so I won't mind trying to pick it up again at some future point.

Playtested this game several times and played a scenario once more, always as the Confederate. They have a tough road ahead, as they should, given the poor initial deployment by Beauregard. 

The game entries in the RSS are kept fresh by Dave's use of "troubling events" (random events) as well as the fact that the orders writing helps to ensure that almost every game is somewhat different. Then you have the "autopilot" scenario. 

Another note: South Mountain is a great situation, too, and will be even more accessible than "A Fearful Slaughter", with one map and fewer counters (as Chris Milne has already stated).

The RSS system is very complex and recommended for those Monster games players with the patience for detail. That being said, this game is more accessible than the other RSS battles because of its smaller size...(note this system has evolved into new Line of Battle Series...as such I have reduced the rating here. In reality when I will play this game again, it will be with the new LOB rules)

I really like the way the Command system from the Civil War Brigade series has been modified for the regimental scale.  The combat system feels more like Terrible Swift Sword than the current GBACW games published by GMT do.  This is a large game, but playable by two or it would support teams with two people on a side.

This is a good battle at this scale, famous enough to be worth playing but not too many units or too many days.  I've just played Day 1, which took long enough to complete.

Regimental Sub-Series (RSS) games on American Civil War.  An ambitious project that try to bring the war on par with Europa on WW2.  The result is mixed.  Some like it while some don't -for the same reasons: huge maps, thousands counters and the troop order system.

A great monster game that deserves more attention than it gets. As Civil War tactical games go, this is one of the better ones out there. Using a derivative/sister ruleset to the Civil War Brigade ruleset from The Gamers, this game manages to provide a unique enough experience to be a different game altogether.

RATING: 8
The most accesible of the series and probably the only one it would be sane to attempt with two players.  A great improvement over the disappointing brigade equivalent (April's Harvest).

A relatively cheap copy came up in the CSW Marketplace.  It was only a matter of time before I caved in and bought this to complete my LoB/RSS collection.  That was all it took for me to crumble.

Too much good stuff! Based on CWB system (that I personally did not care for). People say Rich Berg's original SPI Shiloh game was fiddly; this one is fiddly squared! Great graphics though. I liked the SPI game much better.

I really like the concept of these 'Regimental Sub System' games, but I think they're just a bit too much work for me. The often massive amounts of units and written orders, etc, are more well suited to a gaming group than just two people. That said, if this is the sort of thing you're interested in, you're gonna love these games. This one can be set up on a large table, at least, rather than in a garage.

Really like how command works in this game.  Waiting for leaders to accept their orders can put a real crimp in your plans.  Good to have a system where the gamer isn't all knowing and leaders react perfectly to whatever you want them to do.
Also really improves solo playability as you are not quite sure what they leaders are going to do.

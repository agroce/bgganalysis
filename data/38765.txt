The games theme and mechanisms fit very well together. The idea that your ‘workers’ that you place on the board represents time that they spend on an activity makes sense; the outcomes of each action are related (e.g. networking improves your popularity and consultancy meetings get you information); and the various improvements and their benefits are correlated (the marketing section helps with advertising while the IT floor gives you more information). However, it still felt a bit ‘dry’ to me. Maybe it’s the theme itself that wasn’t particularly engaging and while I can appreciate the cleverness of the design and how everything interlocks I’m not sure it is sufficiently different to other worker placement games for it to become a ‘keeper’

Useless.  The definition of JASE.

Another game of balancing multiple currencies and not enough time/money to complete your perfect plan.  But here there is no tension, narrative, or really anything to engage with.  I cannot see why I would play this instead of Agricola, or any number of similar games that are *much* better realized.

Avoid.

A really tight economy makes this a nice tense worker placement.  The balancing mechanism for workers makes it less advantageous to build out a bunch of workers, unlike most similar games.

I had the opportunity to play this one at Origins in the Board Room. To be fair, it was completely with prototype parts and this surely hurt my impressions. Still, this one looks like it could be good fun as a medium complex worker placement game. What I enjoyed was the theme which took you from initial business to final success which is more satisfying than (say) Power Struggle. For now, I leave it as above average - but would play again if had the chance.

Ground Floor is an enjoyable economic simulation game.  The primary mechanism is worker placement, and it does that well.  The cost of adding workers is such that it's not an obvious choice that you should always do so, which is something many worker placement games fail to achieve.  The random economic forecasts mix things up and help add variety through plays.  The two currencies (money and information) create an interesting balance act as you cannot just focus on one over the other.

If I had one complaint about the game, it would be that it can play long, at least with 5 players.  That said, it stays interesting the whole way through, so if you don't mind longer games, or if you have a smaller play group, this shouldn't be a problem.

Ein sehr schönes Spiel, wenn auch sehr abstrakt. Oder genau deshalb so schön? Die einzelnen Positionen im Spiel machen Sinn und sind eingängig. Das Wirtschaftssystem ist schön überlegt.
Wie hoch ein Wiederspielreiz ist, bleibt abzuwarten. Jedoch durch die Erweiterung mit den verschiedenen Wirtschaftsszenarien sicherlich nochmal höher.
Besonders gelungen ist das 3-Währungs-System aus den Zeiteinheiten (Aktionssteinen), Geld und Information. Während sich Geld relativ einfach in Information umwandeln lässt und Information auch so recht einfach "generierbar" ist, ist es deutlich schwieriger an Geld zu kommen - gerade später im Spiel mit vielen Mitarbeitern und in einer Rezession oder Depression.

Build a company, hire employees, expand your operations, manufacture [PRODUCT].  I really like most things about this worker-placement game, and though I don't know that much of it is especially new or unique, it all fits together nicely, and is solidly produced as well.

You start out alone, in an office full of quite inefficient rooms and apparently a 9-year annuity rather than a large lump sum of starting cash.  You'll get 4 time units to place around both your own personal board representing your company and the larger shared board representing the other businesses all players can interact with.  Balance your time between immediate payoffs from manufacturing, marketing, and selling goods, and using your resources to invest in employees and capital.

The game manages to successfully build over time, as companies become more productive, more efficient, and your workforce grows.  However, the game ends anticlimactically, with victory being based on points, which come from having the most, shiniest rooms (Actually productive rooms will provide some points, but there are also unproductive "achievement" rooms worth more).  So you spend 7 of your 9 years building a company, making it profitable, and growing it, and 2 years building what I assume are just gigantic trophy rooms for yourself.

The other issue I have with the game comes from the economy.  The economy fluctuates from turn to turn, with a deck of cards indicating the demand for products and the supply of workers.  The backs of the cards provide some information, but still have a range of possible specific numbers.  This all fine, and adds some variation and randomness to what is otherwise a luck-free game.  However, if the cards come up in the wrong order, you can have a very strange economy indeed, one which is driven entirely by the assembly and subsequent disassembly of products for research purposes, without anything actually getting sold on the market.  I suppose this isn't a problem in itself, but since assembly and R&D are both done on a player's board, it makes the game into multiplayer solitare until the economy warms back up.

I love the components in this game.  Everything is construction or building-themed, with a player board and cards that look like blueprints, and a skyline as the main board.  The player boards deserve special mention: as you expand your company, you purchase floor and room tiles and physically put them on your building, expanding your board upwards when you add a floor, and covering an existing room when you remodel.  TMG wisely avoided paper money, opting instead for cardboard chips and wooden blocks for resources.  Also as a weird components note, the box is freakishly sturdy, and I suspect I could use it to store bricks if I needed to.

RATING: 7
Kickstarted and first played at BGG.CON 2012.

Very fun game and oozes with theme.  The really core and fundamental part of the game is about jockey-ing for position around popularity and playing the market correctly, as that will be the primary source of income in the game unless you are a single employee company.  

My one concern is that the setup of the game is more or less constant (can choose from the same bank of office remodel, tenant improvements, and empty floors) with the only varying thing is the event cards which tell you the recession/depression/stable/boom etc.  It is possible that the gave may be able to be "solved" and there are definitely cards that will always be bought first in the game (e.g. Small Market in Puerto Rico).  The one mitigating factor is that there is not a limit of 2 of each office remodel, so each person has a fair shot at them.

That said, we had someone go all employees, someone go with a lone employee, and a mix in between and all of the different strategies seemed to work out well so perhaps it isn't an issue, but only time will tell.

An absolute gem of a game that combines engine-building and worker-placement. For the engine-building aspect, players are expanding onto their business by building floors, upgrading rooms, and adding employees to their business. Players do this to get victory points, to make actions more efficient, to gain access to new actions, or to get more time markers. For the worker-placement aspect, players use those time markers to do everything from acquiring resources (game has two currencies) to expanding their business. But unlike a lot of worker-placement games, where it is first come first serve, many of the worker-placement spots are their own mini-game and cost money/resources to place a time marker. Thus, what others players are doing and are capable of doing becomes very relevant. And because one action may give a certain player a resource, which you need for a second action, you really need to be careful about where you place your time markers; if you place poorly and are unable to utilize a time marker, not only did you waste that marker... you wasted whatever it cost to place the marker. In the end, this is the type of game that forces you to plan ahead, which makes the game-play especially rich but also can slow down the game. 

My only complaint about the game is that there is some luck. Now, I don't want to overstate the amount of luck this game has... because the game tells you the economic climate 2-rounds ahead, the range of products that will be sold under that economic climate, and allows players to sell unsold products next round and/or liquidate them for some cash... but with the tightness of the game-play, it's not unusual for a player to need a certain value to come out. If they get that value... great, they are able to then immediately purchase that improvement/floor. If they don't get that value... they no longer can purchase that improvement/floor (which they already invested in) and may be crippled for the entire game. Overall, the game has little mechanical luck but the luck that it does have can influence the outcome of the game.

Still, the game rewards thoughtful play, punishes bad play, and allows for a variety of different strategies. It also scales quite well... although can be slow with too many players. Overall, it is a very good game.

Sold at 2016 Kublacon Flea market.

First play was with 5 new players (including myself), which led to a very long 4+ hour game.  Towards the end of the game the 5th and then later the 4th player had to drop out due to time constraints, so we modified the rules per player count on the fly (which was very intuitive).  The game flowed much better with 3 and 4 players and is likely best with 3-4 experienced players.  Overall, I enjoyed the game more than I expected.  I managed my cash terribly considering I had knowledge of the upcoming economic conditions--but I understand why it happened and I definitely see a lot of room for improvement in my 2nd game.  It is possible to ignore popularity and still do well in the game.  This is a plus for me since I have tired of economic/civ games where you need to manage/balance every currency simultaneously (e.g. The Capitals).  There is a chance this could move to an 8 if I can actually find experienced players to play with me again.

Ho hummmmm...just another day at the office.  Only one game - with two players - but it was soooooooo dry dry dry.  Like the Mojave.  Beautifully produced, but that's about all I loved about the game.  45 minutes a player?  For conducting business?  If it came down to a decision between this and Power Struggle for an office-themed game, the latter would win out every time...by a mile.

(2-6 players, 25 min/player) You've got a great idea to sell widgets that no one else has thought of, but it takes more than a good idea to make it in the sea of startup entrepreneurship. Featuring simple rules but fairly accurate business mechanics, you'll have to manage what parts of your business to outsource (production, storage, marketing) and which to keep in-house. Grow your business over 5 rounds and see who's made it to the big time!

First Play: (5 Players). Explanation took some time as the intertwining of functions on the player's board and main board took some working out. I was intrigued by the theme because I design and fit out offices for a living, however the game never reminded me of of my job and the catagories for each potential action are completely abstract from reality and each other. Its a good job I don't care about theme because this suffers no examination at all.

As the game chugged on it revealed itself to be a very dry experience. The word 'dry' was used many times. I'd go so far as to say its soul-less. An absolute exercise in accountancy with little meaningful interaction with any other players. Relatively luck free but just not fun.

It seems prone to those who suffer AP. I dont understand why because some of us sped through our turns. Others seemed to switch off as they pondered. The playing time of 90-120 was miles off. Our game took over 210 minutes and we were a turn off finishing it before we had to pack up. However I was willing the game long over after two hours. This really over stayed its welcome and seems massively repetitive over the 9 agonising turns.

Not an experience I want to repeat. I give it 6/10 because the production quality is high, even if the money and info chits are microscopically small. This is more like a very bad day at the office.

I enjoyed the game.  It flowed very well.  There are some randomness issues that I suspect would only really bother someone like me, but which are large enough to turn me off from wanting to play again soon.  It's also easily mitigated, in a way that should work.

The game is looking quite strong, needing only some moderate tweaks.

A solid and thematic, if still dry, euro.  It requires some long term planning but is also tight AND random.  As it is most likely to appeal to strategy game players, the amount of randomness that can significantly impact your play seems like a miscalculation. This is especially true at 2-player.  It is definitely better at higher player counts.

Rating based upon 5-player game. I felt it was like a mixture of Caylus and Agricola. It's kinda cool for how well it simulated companies competition in the real world in many perspectives. 5Player been very intense. However it probably won't shine with 2-player. Such a pity.
After a couple days I kept thinking about how to optimize my moves in gameplay. Although the theme isn't my typical like, the game made me want to revisit it.
Turn order(double as popularity) is important here. I feel it should compensate some for the last two players at the start of game.

Sept 2017 - I enjoyed this but I think my friend Chris is correct with this comment (paraphrased)...it was good and I enjoyed the process of figuring out the game but something didn't grab...

It was missing a true hook.  Something that compels you to come back.  This epiphany hit me after he said that.  We just played a week before, T&E and for the first time, I want to play that again.  It caught me (but I'm not sure where or how).  GF really didn't.  I'll play again as I really enjoyed the theme and it's tight but I just do not think there are any surprised that are going to pop up.  It's definitely a 7 and will play again but I just don't see the potential of it going any higher in future plays.

Nice worker placement with many actions to choose, all of which are good and profitable. Interaction is based mostly on interfering with turn order and using some actions before other players do.

Nothing distinguishable. Runaway leader problem. Once you are a level behind, it's very hard to catch up.

I really admire this game's design. The way that turn order affects your actions both negatively and positively turns the typical worker-placement mechanic on its head. Often you WANT someone to take a space before you. The goods/information/money engine is very complex and interesting, because you always need a little of one to get another and you rarely have an abundance of all three (except I suppose toward the end of the game). 

However, the theme really does not come through for me. You are a landlord, right? Why do you need to buy goods to store in a closet? Why does spending those goods get you information? Why do you need information to buy a floor? Who are you advertising to? And the real kicker: what kind of building is built one floor at a time while its occupants use the floors beneath it? The whole thing seemed kind of stupid to me, and I felt as though we might as well be playing with numbers on an empty spreadsheet. 

On the other hand, on the basis of mechanics alone, I still think it's a very good game. I just wish it had been called "money engine." Now THAT's an original theme!

Economic engine game featuring three currencies, time, money, and info.  Info seems the easiest to gain, and comes in various stages of the game. Money is the most difficult to come by, not only is it unreliable, but in small chunks. The game is very balanced, in that you can gain two of the three, but then the other eludes you. I'm not convinced I need to own, but will keep for a while longer.

Really fun worker placement game where you're running your own company.  There fluxuation in the market which changes how many consumers and workers will be available.  Upgrading your building with rooms and floors helps create combo chains and make it easier to get things accomplished.

One interesting thing I found about the game is that things cost both money AND information.  Having a lot of one doesn't do much without the other.

In many ways admirable -- and a good first-time effort by the designer -- however our first game took really long and the final scores just seemed in a way too low and too close -- like we had struggled for almost three hours to be slightly off each other's low scores. A weird comment, but it didn't feel like the effort. Also, this is largely a well-themed optimization exercise that doesn't seem nearly as much fun as a other worker placement games, some of which aren't as well themed but are flat-out more fun (Stefan Feld games come to mind).

Definitely going to give it another go, though, as first games can often feel long as players are trying to figure the game out.

Preliminary thoughts (after one 4-er) are that it's a good game, but I don't care for the way the Consultation track works. Probably could have used some more playtesting. The two separate currencies in the game (money and information) seem unnecessary as well. Probably could have done away with one of them, as they are spent in (usually) equal amounts.

RATING: 7.5
Rated after 1 play @ 6 players

Despite being called "Ground Floor" and featuring a building on the front of the box, this game has very little to do with building physical infrastructure. It's all about building a company that produces goods and sells them. The measure of success for each company is how many floors they expand their on their headquarters. Instead of workers, each employee has a number of time tokens (similar to shifts in Kanban) that can be used to perform actions. The difficulty in the game is managing the two currencies you need - information and money. The way to make a go at the game seems to be to do everything a little bit and build floors that work well together. I would play this again but not sure that it's different enough from other games in my collection to buy at the current prices. 

At 6 players, the game took 4-4.5 hours to finish.

Has some neat ideas and sort of works, but my first impression is that it might be a little too easy to hose yourself with one mistake.  Strategy is a little fragile, there seem to be balancing issues and it probably needed more play testing.  Either that, or I just didn't play we'll :). But seriously, the other players were concerned that the first player advantage is too much at the beginning of the game, and honestly there seemed to be too much emphasis on the power of popularity.  Game slows way down in layer rounds.  Still, I may give it another shot to see if I end up liking it more or less

Ground Floor is a somewhat interesting but also somewhat flawed game.

There are some interesting decisions to be made and a couple original "mini-game" sort of ideas... but there are more problems than plusses.

First, the game takes considerably longer than advertised... and it also starts very slowly. After things start moving, it speeds up but becomes a little repetitive, where you need to do the same 5-6 actions each round because those were the actions you invested in earlier.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the final scores of the game don't seem to match up meaningfully with how well the players actually seemed to play the core mechanics of the game. Instead, it seems like the game wants you to know exactly which bonus tile you'll want to build in the final round and then play your entire game toward that single end. (And then, you might not get that needed bonus tile... it's hard to guarantee your turn order and options quite that precisely.)

Hit and miss.

Players start a business and attempt to develop it into a powerful company. 

Fun, tight worker placement, or rather time management game, where players take turns to place time tokens out onto the game board to lock in actions.  The tokens, I guess, represent man hours, and are used to add abilities to your business, acquire the game currencies (money, information and goods), and use those currencies to develop growth. Growing your business means adding "floors" to your business, which gives you powers and directs your strategies.  The ultimate goal to to acquire victory points via money and business abilities.  Very enjoyable game with lovely presentation (although some of the fonts on the tiles is very tiny).  Game play is tight and you always seem to be short of something.  I'm a little concerned about game length with 5 or 6 players.

Pros:  I felt engaged the whole time (3 hrs).  There is a lot to think about, and the balancing of cash and files (the two currencies) can be tricky.   Good variety of improvements and lots of options.  The retailing of goods can be very high risk.  That's likely to be a contentious point for this game, but I liked it.

Cons:  huge amount of wasted space on the board, VP icons and helper text are way too small as a result.   Chits for cash and files are way too small.   Graphic design UI could have been a lot better.  Theme is dull and the game lacks a "fun factor".  Mechanisms feel unoriginal. Play time is too long for what it is. I don't expect to play this again, realistically.  The game has no arc or development, and that's a killer in a game of this length.

Played twice. Both times the winner was the player with the "Popularity does not decay" improvement, which may be too powerful?

Painfully dry, and takes much longer than predicted. I admire the mechanics of it all - need to place this worker to get info NEXT turn so that two turns from now I can build an extra floor to be more efficient than I am now - but the length of turns drains any tension.

RATING: 7
A nice, meaty sequential action worker placement game in the same vein as AOE:III or Dominant Species, but I like this one better than both of those. Like those, you place in locations that are resolved in order but each location is like a sub-game in itself rather than just resolution in left to right order in those two aforementioned games. This makes for some interesting jockeying each turn, especially in Publicity as that determines turn order which is important for both placing workers on the next turn but also selling goods on the current turn. 

It’s a tight design largely in part because you frequently need each of the two currencies in the game --money and info -- in order to take an action, and on some turns you’ll hope to get what you need from a previous action space just in time to use in a subsequent action space on the same turn. There's a bit of tempo skill required in managing your money and your info (often getting them on alternate turns), and once the endgame starts, it comes quickly. 

One aspect I quite like is that while like most w-p games, you can get additional workers, but here it can actually be a mistake to hire too many workers as they may end up costing you too much money and time to train them. Most worker placement games only reward you for getting more workers; here it's a careful consideration. 

Also, some caveats. Just like its sister games, this is a long, heavy, and thinky experience that requires players to carefully consider the order things will be resolved or risk wasting a subsequent action. Consequently, I would recommend either playing a turn then restarting or going through a sample turn such that nobody gets hosed on the first turn then struggles the rest of the game and ends up sour. I can’t believe the game goes up to 6P because I think this is best with 3P due to the length and would only play with more if everyone had played before. Our games take about an hour per player, and I wish it were less than that.

Rating is after one play of the PnP so take with grain of salt. With 3 players including rule explanation it took us a bit over 3 hours. Definitely a long game but I'd expect the time to drop.

The theme and mechanics match very well, the two kinds of worker placement (instant and delayed gratification) are very intriguing. I'm already dying to play again.

Oh, I thought I was winning and ended up coming in last, so it's got that going for it...

Update 5/26/12 - Have now played the PnP version 3 times, with 3, 4, and 5 players respectively. Upgraded rating from 8 to 9. This game is incredibly addictive, always leaving me with the urge to try a different (better) strategy next time. Will probably back the kickstarter although the gameplay is so good that no one seems to mind the rough version of the prototype.

Update 4/6/13 - Now have the Kickstarter copy and have played it 4 times. Still in love with this game.

Whoa, whoa whoa, this game is waaaaaay too long. The box lists the game time as 90 to 120 minutes, the geek has it at 90 minutes straight up. Hell no. Not even close. Maybe 90 minutes per player. We played five players and it clocked in around 5 hours. For that reason I docked this game a ratings point. It really bugs me when the listed time is not even close to the actual time. This game even defeated the game cube. I’d like to create a council for the reformation of box list times. Please help me. Sign my petition. 

In Ground Floor you are the owner of a business and you win by gathering the most victory points at the end of nine rounds. You start the game with one employee who has a certain amount of “time” that you can assign to different tasks to gather “money” or “ideas” that ultimately can be used to grow the business for “victory points.” In that sense you are converting one resource (“time”) for either of two different resources (“money” or “ideas”) for points. 

You can hire more employees to gather more sweat equity, but that costs more money. In addition, a business is nothing without ideas, which cost money and time. It’s a nice balance. There are some cool notions in this game. And the different spaces to spend time was reminiscent of the cascading placement and timing in Caylus or Dominant species. I really liked the market and popularity track (in our game I did not spend any time on popularity but still won the game. We decided I must have been a cigarette company). However, the game play was not nearly as deep as either of the before mentioned games but twice as long. For that reason, the game lagged near the end. Did I mention the game was long. 

The game components were exceptional. Stacking the different shapes and building your business floor by floor was satisfying. Plus, the rooms were parallelograms. I like parallelograms. In the end, the novelty of the mechanics wears off about halfway through the game. And, oh yeah, I docked the game another point, because of the designers picture and testimony to his creator in the rule book. Lame.

RATING: 6
Ground Floor is a heavy worker placement and resource management game. The economy is built upon the three basic currencies time, money, and information. Those currencies are not easily convertible in most cases which is something I like in principle.

However, it also means that quite often the exact amount of one resource or another can make a huge difference, leading to longer turns than strictly necessary (or advisable) Combine that with longer turns due to an increased work force and, paradoxically, less competition because over time, many of the most attractive time sinks tend to be on the private player boards, and you have a game that takes longer than it should without really bringing anything new to the table. It works, and works well, but is lacking somewhat in spirit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very good game, currently my favorite worker placement game.

Don't let the economic theme push you away, not a single player in my group likes the theme as such, but all agree it is a brilliant game mechanically.

The first playthrough takes a bit longer, but we can now manage a round at some 20-30 minutes per player, which is manageable.

You are never bored waiting, because the round is broke down into smaller more manageable decisions, which really help the appearance of good pace, and unlike a lot of similar games players never really want to "go grab something while you guys decide what to do".

Warm recommendations.

Rating after 5 plays. Worker placement game, game really takes about 40 minutes per player. +30 minutes for tile reading (1st game), +15 minutes rules explanation. Rate 1 point lower if 2-player or more then 4 players, does not scale well. I would say it's about 45-60 minutes too long for what it is, a lot of rinse and repeat actions. I have serious doubts that anyone really played this with 6 people in testing, it's nice to have extra color choices but I think you will be very angry after playing with 5 or 6 players.

Prelim rating of Print and Play version -possibly will give it another play as a friend has already backed the Kickstarter version, which no doubt Tasty Minstrel Games will make pretty.  Seemed long for a game with ridiculously bland scoring.  Unsurprisingly, this led to a virtual 3 way tie in our 5 player game. The theme and point scoring are pretty horrid unless you're a rock star in real life hoping to someday become a desk jockey that's good at Excel.  Nearly half the game relies on competing for "popularity", which is just a way of determining start player/turn order. 

I found Ground Floor to be surprisingly imbalanced right out of the gate with the last player needing to concede actions on turn one just to get what other players already have (higher turn order, which gives the cheapest hiring rate, the best bonus selection, best building selection, etc..)

On the plus side, the office modules do have a little variety, and I tend to like variable end-game timing.  You can basically try to end the game sooner by going exclusively after floors, although you pay premiums to do so.

In the end, I found it to be as much an arithmetic exercise as game, given the rest of the game (non-turn order) is mostly resource conversions to sets that buy things.

10 years ago I might have rated this a 5, but given all the great worker placement games, I think it's unlikely to hit the table again.

Actually enjoyed this more than I thought and it did not take too long to play.  Rules and grokking took more than it should, although it clicks pretty quickly after that.

A few spaces could have been ultimately fixed for a "complete" 2 player experience.  The rest of the game works well and does fulfill a good 2 player game but having all parts work well would have improved it some.
(Mini expansion with cardboard overlays that go on top of the Consulting Firm and Marketing Bonus anyone?)

Opinion: this is a hard economic game, make a bad decision and maybe you cannot fight for the victory. Although the them is not fascinating, it is really well integrated. Manage your factory to grow and try to sell your goods when you have to, while getting enough information to manage all what is happening.
Is worker placement, but with a different taste from other worker placement games you can find there.
Loved the idea that you have to plan well what you are doing. The popularity track (turn order) could seem to be the most important thing, but it is not, if you manage to do everything when you have to, the turn order is not so important

In our first play, it took a lot of time to understand the rules, and longer to figure out what the hell to do!  Nevertheless, we like it, and it could get another play...

The scarcity of money and information makes for a lot of difficult decisions, even (especially?) on the first turn.  It's hard to figure out how to develop a good economic engine.  You have to know what advanced building floors are available to form a good strategy, but that could be overwhelming for new players.

Ground Floor is an interesting worker placement, focusing on modern business.  Instead of meeples, each 'employee' level grants work tokens based on time worked.
Purchased and actions generally require both work tokens and a mix of twin currencies: Cash and Data.
While it is still fairly abstracted, the theme is clearly born out by the mechanics.
Workers placed on the home board can grant goods, or data, or can be used for R&D or training.
The game itself is an engine builder, and in a way the limited purchase tokens remind me a bit of Outpost- they are limited, generally, and there is a certain inevitable snow ball effect as players snap up tiles that chain together to continue the engine growing process.
That said, this is a solid game, if not an all-time champion.

(08/10/2013) Comment based on one play.

This feels like a very intricate and detailed simulation of "real world" business, involving advertising, public relations, manufacturing, and selling widgets. However, the real goal is to construct "floors" so as to build ever higher and higher office buildings. The additional floors are where most of the VPs are concentrated, but also allow for improvements in your resource-generating engine.

At its core, this is a worker placement game, with many familiar euro-centric game mechanisms, but cleverly shrouded in a tightly integrated theme. The "workers" are actually "time" allotments--hire more workers and you get more action discs. There are three kinds of resources: money, information, and widgets, all which are generated in various ways through action discs, where each can be transformed into the other two, or combined to purchase office rooms or floors, which are sort of like "buildings" in other euros.

In some ways, this game is similar to Dominant Species, in terms of the various types of actions available. Turn order is determined by the amount of "popularity" generated through advertising, but also determines the priority of selling widgets. Like Rails of New England, there is an economic forecast, which randomly determines the demand for the widgets, as well as adjusting the affordability of the worker pool. Further, the game is unique in that there are various economic "scenarios" that can simulate the feel of the "Roaring 20's", "The Great Depression", "The Tech Boom", or other famous economic periods.

As a business/manufacturing simulation, it is heavily abstracted, since the players are all making generic widgets. The process in making them is rather dry, too, feeling like a typical flowchart, but the decision tree can be rather complex, intricate and rich, much like running a real business.

This is a rather good game for a Kickstarter project, with good components, rules, and gameplay. The individual player boards show the office buildings in an isometric view, so one gets the 3D feel of buildings going up as players add floors. Still, one cannot help but realize that this is yet another dry, resource conversion game, despite the rather corporate feel of the theme. It's not bad, but it's not great. Initial rating" "7".

Update (02/21/2014) 2 plays: Okay, this game pisses me off. The game really isn't about manufacturing widgets, like a traditional resource production/management game. It has everything to do with getting enough stuff to build as many floors as you can, along with aligning some of those floors with bonuses. There is also a constant pissing contest around Advertising, which determines the all important turn-order. Ignore popularity at your peril. I am willing to try this again, but have low expectations. 3.5 hours flew by, as this was an intense, immersive game. However, all agreed that for the decisions and enjoyment, it was 60-90 minutes too long for what it is.

Interesting game with lot of long term planning. Played with four players and used included rule explanation 3,5 hours. New floors were entering the game after 5-6 rounds. All players were struggling with choices and game was quite overwhelming. However after the 8th round games tempo was increasing and there was a high feeling of managing. So last rounds were played i high tempo. Overall after one play: slowly played game with lot of depth. Takes many rounds to see the meaning of the game. Hard to come back after wrong planning, but will be better after some more plays, but is it worth it to spend so many hours on this game while there are a lot of other good games......

Game-play offers narrow strategic options. Upgrades only provide minor efficiency so players remain heavily dependent on the main board. It is not possible to focus on a monetary / information / production / construction strategy etc. This lacks of diversity means players are always undertaking the same steps.

There's a lot to get your head around first time you play this hard-nosed business game, but it's pretty simple once you get going. There are 3 currencies: cash, knowledge and time which vary in their scarcity throughout the game. With them you have to build your business engine and hope it runs faster than everyone else's. The theme is about as exciting as accountancy, there's none of the charm of Russian Railroads for instance and the end scoring is tight for such a long game (allow 150 minutes first time you play) giving that '$1 more, I'd have won' feel. Competent without being exceptional.

It is essentially worker placement game with really smart and interesting mechanics (some places for workers will give rewards immediately, some only in next phase). It is simple, yet requires a lot of planning, both long term and short term.

In essence it is great game, but long and requires a lot of thinking, so I will not play it that often (thus 6,5 and not 7).

Enjoyed this game . . . a few thoughts:
- Very engaging, despite a theme that I would have never adopted.  [Shouldn't going to meetings subtract from your VP total?]
- Worker placement, but not really worker placement.  It's "time and resource allocation" and involves a lot of making logical connections between actions and building augmentations.
- Yes, 90 minutes playing time is (very) optimistic - particularly on the first play.  That being said, I was not bored at any point.

The only part of the game that is not good for me is that a key part of the game is positioning yourself to "buy first" heading into the rounds in which new floors become available.  It's a legitimate game mechanic, but it just seems a bit artificial.

RATING: 7.5
A huge sleeper hit of business and economic efficiency euro. Contains an amount of depth that many developers are afraid of matching for the fear of being too intimidating. Indeed, there is a ton here to consider, but oh man, what you have here is one of the best rulebooks I have read, with useful player aids and convenient cheat text on the board itself.

As far as the gameplay goes, it is engrossing and addictive, especially if you are an armchair economist. Powerful and dynamic in its asymmetry. Scheduling around your competition takes cunning. Punishing if you hedge inappropriately or fail to plan ahead (was not until too late did I determine my income could not float my overall strategy).

If I have criticisms, it is how much this can drag if you are playing with AP-prone players. Much like what I traded for it. Seriously, I considered investing in a turn timer because of this one, because I really like it, but I was scraping and the time between turns was little short of suffering.

That aside, I traded away the pathetic production value of the 2E Terraforming Mars for a near-mint KS edition of this, and I do not regret my decision at all.

A disappointment.  And I had such a high hopes for it... :(

Very very DRY game of juggling between 3 resources: money, information and good cubes and turning them into VPs by acquiring floors/rooms.
The game feels very generic and _there_are_too_few_dimensions_ in it.  Very similar to 'Power Grid: Factory Manager' in that respect.

Maybe I would've given it a '6', had the game been shorter.  But when I think I have to spend 3+h on something not particularly exciting, I suddenly cool off.

Clever economic game, a little dry. It simulates well the processes of growing, advertising, production and sale, and also the social behavior, but the victory points have a poor relation with that process.

After 2 plays, I think it needs some adjustements, for example some compensations for the lastest players at the beginning (some extra information point would be good), or the option of building empty flats for all the players (the only way to make an improvement without losing a department in the office). In any case, the game is too long, we spent 4-5 hours. For this I'd rather Wealth of Nations or Automobile.

Rating based on 20 - 25 plays.  Ground Floor is probably my favorite new game of the past year, dating from Essen 2012 through September 2013.  It's the best business sim out there, and every game plays out differently due to the changing economic climate which dictates how many products will sell and also how quickly businesses can expand.  I find the game to be very, very underrated on BGG and, IMHO, it should have been a strong candidate for many of the game-of-the-year awards but, perhaps because it was a KS game, it was largely ignored by the gaming cogniscenti.  Too bad, because this is a really top-flight game, only the 11th game I have rated as a 9 or higher.

Played the print and play with finalized rules.  This is not a heavy, deep, or complicated game....in fact for me it was overly simplistic and therefore way too long, tedious, and boring for what it was.  The choices are obvious, theme is more boring than dry white toast..and you guessed it the theme is painted on.  

Painted on theme is fine for me as long as the game is exciting but this game made me want to claw out my eyes from the sheer bordom and I only played the two player version.  By the way, the rules as they stand now for two player are not good, some of the elements of the game become extremely trivial, or don't exist in the two player...

Update after 2 years and 13 plays.

Ground Floor continues to impress! The length is an issue and does prevent if from hitting the table very often. However, it's long because there are non-trivial decisions to be made and the game rewards planning in advance and making every dollar/info count. 

The thing that continues to amaze me about the design is the level of variability in such a deep and thematic game. The market really influences your decisions and changes your play style, not to mention the event deck from the overfunding expansion.

-------------------------------

Very solid game with interesting, thematic, and unique mechanisms. The main downside is the length; even with experienced players I can't imagine playing this with 6p, I think 4p is the limit.

The game is an economic engine builder with two secondary resources (money and information) which must be converted into VP. There is lots of variety in what you build and which economic forecast cards show up. If the playtime could come down to 2 hours this might be a 9!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Where to start with this game... I have played once the full version and had a strongly negative experience. We played with 5 experienced gamers and it took a little over 4 hours. I lost interest after about 90 minutes which hilariously is also the time stated on the box. 

It's a pure economic snowball engine game with a business theme. There's a hr dept and accountants etc. just like at work. I'm can only assume that the theme is aimed at someone else because if like me you work in a corporation you may find this just very similar to your day job. 

Summary:

Way too long, by about double. 

Not much happens in the game- very poor narrative arch. 
A 'business' game where money is not your goal, your after vps which is weird. 

Poor graphic design choices- where is the 1st floor? The floor guide starts at 2nd floor which makes for a very weird rule regarding the end game conditions (the game ends when a player builds the 5th floor, which is the 6th floor!). 

At the end of the game I sat back and said "is that it?" The game far outstayed its welcome and did not provide much in the way of entertainment, original play or excitement in the mechanics. 

Dry and dull, avoid.

RATING: 7
Ground Floor comes with an attractive graphic design that speaks to me. Economic games are among my favourites. Hence, my expectations were comparably high and Ground Floor almost was able to meet them.
Players have to maintain a steady flow of two main currencies, money and information in order to build up their company and purchase new floors as main VP condition as well as economic engine. New workers can be employed and goods have to be produced to be sold on a volatile market. Each worker comes with a limited time budget that has to be attributed to the various actions. Basically, it's worker placement with a following resolution phase. Actions in your own company can be resolved immediately giving further resources for the next actions. Planning ahead is important to not end up with too few of any currency in the various phases.
There's a lot to think about and getting a working engine up in the first half of the game is crucial. While I enjoyed the game, the second half can drag once you're locked into certain patterns. At times, it felt like going through the motions to reach the end without many important decisions left. It would help if players get faster with experience to speed up this part. 
I'm not sure yet if the game is good enough to warrant rare four hours of game time for a single game. It bothers me that the achievement floors are so similar that it's mainly a matter of who gets one more of them deciding the game. Many actions aren't as tight as I wish they were. From reading through the forums I get the impression that there's nonetheless enough meat in this to allow widely differing strategies although the single variable element is the random setup of the economy cards.
Ground Floor gains the title of "First enjoyable Kickstarter game".

I was completely annoyed by this game from the beginning and it didn't let up at all. The main problem I have with the game is that player order is so important that it seems ludicrous that there is no compensation for turn order in the beginning of the game. The game centered completely around turn order and I can't imagine it ever playing out differently in the future.

I have to admit that I am also biased against Tasty Minstrel Games in general. It probably sounds really dumb but it really bothered me that the author's name is on the board. I would have never noticed had I not already been irritated by the game, but that little detail pushed me over the edge.

感想：
1. 主題性唔錯, 有商業競爭感，也有公司發展感覺。由收集消息。再由增加公司知名度，從而影響銷售業績。最後有消息有錢自然公司發展好，就擴展公司。還有受社會環境影響，是一個滿完整的主題。
2. 互動性低, 主要在爭知名度。但整過是各主各做事。
3. 3種資源轉換，策略程度只算中策
4. 規則量中等，但較瑣碎
5. 主要缺點，每場受環境因素影響而令策略不同。但在一場遊戲，9個回合重覆度高。去到後期其實已經機械性運轉，令我覺得9回合太長

RATING: 7.8
Tentative initial rating after first play. We spent a good bit of the first play figuring out how the rules worked and how things interacted. Looks like multiple paths to victory and the ability to always do something even if not waht you want. One or two improvements feel very powerful but way too early to tell if overpowered (eg PR firm). Don't think there's a runaway leader issue but perhaps it's possible to put yourself out of the running through bad early choices - not sure yet. A little fiddly bits and sequencing but not over the top brain melting. Definiteyl a game that at least 3/4 wanted to play again and we saw getting a lot faster once every had a play under their belt

There's a lot going on in this game and it really takes a couple or so plays to grasp it all and figure out how it all fits together.  And frankly, I'm not that crazy about the way this does the things it does (getting files, building popularity, making upgrades, etc.).  There are other games out there that do this sort of thing in ways that are more engaging to me so I don't really have the desire to put the effort into playing this enough where I could possibly get more enyoyment out of it.  I think I'd rather play something else.  But I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it.

It's a game that demonstrate pretty well why real life is boring.

In a summary, it's puerto rico with Worker placement. There are some cool ideas, like you can build floors that gives upgrade to your company, but I just don't like the game.

There are a lot of special powers that either come from buildings or either comes from worker placement. So most of the time, you are confused by the choices and possibilities.

Second, there is a certain lack of structure and consistency. For example, I like the "Empty Room" floors that could be used to placed certain rooms in them. But you have other floors that comes with their special powers. Be consistent, if a floor is a special power in it self, then all floors should work this way. Personally, I would have preferred that each floor allowed you to have 2 rooms.

Calculating the floor cost is also very confusing. I would also have liked to possibility to manage various kinds of companies, like those focusing more on goods, while other could be focusing more on services.

I think placing time on your sheet and in the central board is just very annoying. Using only your sheet would have been better, but it would have reduces interaction between players.

Finally, the board is too big, there is about 30% of wasted space on the board with nothing on it.

Not sure how fun this game is considering the theme is about office work...:-)  There appears several valid routes to victory and the different starting abilities may help push players to those avenues.  Some of the main board actions require a bit of cooperation.  The interaction/decisions between using main board actions which are fought over to some degree versus your own board can be interesting.

The thematic disconnect is incredibly annoying: You're a CEO of a company and you're going to build it up so that, at the end of the game, the one with the fanciest office wins. What??

Ignoring that, it's an OK worker-placement game. The balance between money and information is definitely interesting, and so is choosing to play on the main board or in your own personal board (that gets improved actions by building new floors). 

Ultimately it suffered from the same problem with games that are all about pre-planning your turn: You need to balance in your head the resources you'll need for your turn, and if someone changes something unexpected, you may get shut out of your main actions (selling, building).

The different floors give interesting powers that lead to very different strategies. However, the actions themselves felt too abstracted out: spend time in a meeting to create an idea, spend time in manufacturing to create supplies... And the floors just give more efficient actions.

A very nice, heavy game with a theme I like.  My only reservations are the amount of interplay between actions (which is why it is heavy) makes me not really want to teach it to others and it looks like a decent amount of downtime between turns, if you play with a larger group.  The actual flow of the game is simple so that is a plus.

A solid game that while seems complex on the surface, the mechanics are actually quite simple. But it just wasn't really all that exciting. And the 90 minute play time is bogus. Granted a first play with 6 people would take more than 90 minutes, but it took us over 4 hours and no one was dragging their feet. 

Clearly the version I played was not much to look at so I cannot comment on that experience.

3 player game, took 2 hours, PnP copy. Heavier economic worker placement game. I can see elements of Puerto Rico (purchasing rooms for extra abilities and points), In the Year of the Dragon (jockeying for turn order) and there's also the nice worker placement system where you can place to different areas of the board (which are resolved in different ways) or to your own "buildings" - I don't know any other game that works like that - maybe a little like Endeavour. It's a very clean and tight design, has the Agricola/ITYOTD feel of never having enough stuff. I liked the market too, the way the prices are set is very interesting.

I've only played it once and I enjoyed it.  A worker placement game like many others.  Some aspects of the game seemed a little fiddly while others seemed pointlessly added as mechanics to an already busy game.  Of course, it's really hard to tell accurately after one play.

Overall, I would play this again and had a lot of fun playing it the first time.

After two games, I have to say this is probably one of the finest economic games I played in a very long time. Yes it is relatively long (3-4h with 6 players), and yes some turns you have to make lots of small moves, but the purpose is always there. And the competition between players is constant. Instant crush.

Impression after one play. 

Very pretty game with good quality components. 

Pretty heavy euro WP with some mechanics similar to Dominant Species. 

There are a lot of interlocking mechanics, which makes for some interesting decisions, but I have some serious concerns. 

Going first, both at the beginning of the game (which is random) and really in any round, is far too important. Also, certain upgrades just feel overpowered. For example, the Publicity Firm (I think that's the correct name) upgrade may be broken as it gives the players lucky enough to snag the only two such upgrades an outsized advantage in popularity, the single most important thing in the game. 

I think there's a decent game here, but I also think it may be plagued by too many issues that should have been ironed out prior to release. 

I liked it enough that I could be convinced to give it another shot, but unless I see some things I didn't in my first game, my next will be my last.

Kickstarter game. Too complicated and long game. In this game you build you office and manufacture goods and sell them to world. Game has some very good ideas but usually always less is more (Maybe expection is Yngwie Malmsteen whose in some interview says that he thinks that more is more). If this game is little bit simplier and quickier and smoothier, we can talk very good game, now we cannot.

I really enjoy this one, but my wife isn't as big of a fan.  I can see how it may play way too long with more than 4, but I enjoy the unique theme and economic aspects of the game.  There is a lot going on, but it feels unique within my collection.  I'm afraid that my wife's dislike (or indifference maybe) of the game may keep it away from the table, but it'll still stay in my collection.

Economic theme, but in essence just a regular worker placer. Solid game, but not all that special. You can translate any theme into a worker placement game. In that sense it reminds me most of Manhattan Project. And some doubt about replayability. It becomes samey after a few plays, I am afraid. But only one play, rating will be updated after further plays.

One play.  Seemed like a decent game.  A little long with 5, probably best with 3.  It's a worker placement Euro with 3 currencies to manage ($, time, and info).  Wouldn't mind playing it again with 3, but probably won't seek it out.

RATING: 8.5
Possibly my favorite heavy-ish economic game I've played.  The theme seems a bit uninteresting at first glance, but it melds so well with the mechanics and choices in the game that it just feels right.  Various options are tight and very well balanced.  Excellent component quality and art are certainly a nice plus.  Plays long with 5 or 6 players, but otherwise scales very well with all player counts.

A very serviceable economic simulation.  The iconography helps quite a bit and the theme comes through quite well, except your industry is very generic.  The central board is rather ridiculously large.  Some of the text is pretty small.  But the box has a lot of stuff in it.  Money and information quite tight.  Worked well as a two-player game for us; really tough decisions on making sales.

2016-08-13: Interesting worker placement and economic game, featuring mechanisms demonstrated from a number of other games. Incredibly difficult to maximize and see a clear path to victory, especially as some information is only revealed when resolving.

Worker Placement w/ immediate benefits resolution (e.g. Agricola, Caverna)

Worker Placement w/ delayed sequential resolution on a shared board (e.g. Caylus, Dominant Species)

Worker Placement w/ variable resource/worker disc costs (e.g. De Vulgari Eloquentia)

All that is combined w/ engine-building via upgrading your office building, as well as self-directed pricing and market-based demand, makes for a lot of interconnected parts.

Somehow, it feels like there's always too much to do and not enough tokens, or not enough money, or not enough information, or not enough spots for use. I can see the game variability as the sequence of market conditions changes, as it would dictate when the cash injections occur (via market demand).

The Marketting/Popularity track was probably the least intuitive aspect, although it still makes sense -- just our least-enjoyed part of the game (but still very necessary).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game has some unique ways it handles the worker placement system.  The retail and advertising sections can be a bit confusing the first rounds for new people but I like how it fits the theme of what it is trying to convey.  My only downsides is the length of play (3-4 players is the max) and the small little rules that can be easy to forget.  I think the theme is overall good for this game.  Only hurdle is making the supply cubes feel like some sort of product you are selling.

I like the idea of a worker placement where you are placing time rather than workers.  I also like the mechanic of managing 2 resources (money & information).

Advertising mechanics is very cool. And the game actions chosen by players, shifts a lot, depending of the game evolution. To play again, and this time, I'm sure, in less time.

Despite the business management theme being yawnsome for some, I actually like the theme, which is nicely presented and tied together. It's better than the gameplay, which I would say is solid worker placement with a few economic style twists. Gets a bit repetitive and never sparks to life.

RATING: 6.5
Gioco interessante, ricco di opportunità e strategie. Molto carini anche i materiali che si incastrano bene per la costruzione di alti edifici, gioco con ricca interazione. Croce e delizia del gioco è a mio avviso il numero di giocatori, in 6 infatti trovo si scopra la maggior bellezza del gioco sfruttando tutto i potenziale nell'accaparrarsi per primo costruzioni e azioni. Al tempo stesso giocarlo in 6 rende i tempi d'attesa troppo lunghi e le partite un po' stanzanti. Infatti il secondo difetto è che una pessima partenza condiziona fortemente il risultato finale, e spesso già verso metà partita si intuisce il risultato finale facendo apparire gli ultimi turni un lenti e stancanti. Un gioco che a questo punto consiglio in 5 giocatori ma dopo un paio di turni di prova per chi non lo ha mai provato.

A True Euro - Worker Placement game that is absolutely excellent! The theme of this game is so great as you truly feel like a start up business owner in the sense that you want to do every thing and grow you business in every way possible but there is always a shortage of resources in one form or another. This game revolves around making lots of decisions on how to best use your time and few resources. This game can be a real brain burner as you try to optimize your time markers potential. I highly recommend keeping a piece of paper and pencil near by to plan out your turns especially in the late game.

RATING: 6
A pretty dry theme, building up a business, which is actually an overlay for an engine building game. Here you need to build an engine that will efficiently garner you information and money, the two currencies of the game. Your decisions at the start are whether to do it directly (gain straight increases) or indirectly (get more employees to allocate to worker placement spots to gain the increases you need). And that's the game bit that's worth exploring. Towards the end, it's a matter of who can cash in fastest to get the big Puerto Rico bonus type buildings where the major points are to be had. The normal worker placement tension is diluted because you've got your own spots to fall back on (which can also be upgraded). There's some randomness in how much money will get awarded each turn (the flip of an economy card) which can have a turn delaying effect for someone on the wrong end. Because you get so many workers to place, rounds seem to go a long time, leading the game towards a long playing time. You're engaged throughout (because the challange of building an efficient engine inherently does that), but it's a slog, and the lack of thematic excitement doesn't help a looong play time (for what it offers) seem any shorter.

The type of game I enjoy. I really like that players start with companies specialised in different htings, and so fat I had the experience that these really help defining a strategy, which is an element I really enjoy: players being able to pursue different and dynamic strategies.

Excellent with preatty easy rules. Eager to play it with more and different numbers of players.

There is a lot going on when you first read through or have it explained to you. The best route is not obvious and it takes a few rounds to see the possibilities. Also there can be a lot of down time so be prepared or choose the correct group of players. I would suggest playing at 4, as with 5 or 6 the downtime was the worst part, since the game itself is quite fun.

Many have complained about redundant themes in Euro-type games.  "Enough with building castles and trading in the Mediterranean". Well, Ground Floor is about building a corporation in the capitalist western world.  Instead of building ships, we get to send workers to a meeting to get information.  Yippee.  I despise going to meetings, so why would I ever want to simulate that in a board game?  Ground Floor features 2.5 to 3 hours mimicking boring tasks in the corporate world all so you can save up enough money and information to build 5 additional floors in your corporate skyscraper. I will take shipping in the Mediterranean, thank you very much.

This is sort of a worker-placement game, but it features more workers than you typically see: each action space has a prerequisite of placing a certain number of workers there at the same time, so you kind of have to manage your workers like resources.  These resources will get you money and information, which are in turn used to upgrade your rooms (personal action spaces) or buy floors (which either give you more personal action spaces or end-game bonuses).  Where the game kind of fell flat for me was the difficulty in doing anything worth points: only rooms and floors are worth points, and to get them, you have to go through a complex cycle of resource-gathering.  And if the "build" spaces are taken, oh well.  It's not a bad game, I just felt there was a disconnect between the action of the game and the things you needed to do to score points.

If you like playing a hard, very cutthroat game, this is what you are looking for. If you're not short on money, you'll probably miss information and even if you have both, you still need that damn supply-cube if you wanna produce something at the factory. And if you have all, you can score some points and start all over again :D

Besides that, it's a good thing to invest in popularity as it will give you a bonus (maybe small, but can be very important difference to have or not), which off course will cost you some money and info :s

I like this kind of hard games, even the fact that it's as dry as the Sahara doesn't bother me. But I would never play this with more then 3, because gaming time is a tad too long, 2 hours would be perfect, but if you're beginners you'll probably need 2,5. 

If you're beginners I can also strongly recommend to use the predetermined economic forecast, otherwise it can really be too hard.

Edit: played it a second time with the same players and gaming time was beneath 2 hours this time.

The rulebook in this game is difficult because they make their own names for normal game elements and it obfuscates how easy the rule they are actually describing is. The graphic design makes the important areas barely visible on a board too small for 4 players let alone 6. The game forces players in last to pay more for their actions. The timing of when you pay what is split between when you place your worker and when the action is resolved in the next phase which is also needlessly confusing. The game has two resources to manage, money and information tokens, which blocks your ability to build new things in a way I found to be frustrating.

I think the game material doesn't support the game well enough. Some icons should be done better in explaining the game play. Ground Floor is a worker placement and there can be a lot of workers what have to be placed, a bit too much. And the theme is really unappealing to me. The office theme also makes the names between the tiles or actions spaces too little distinct. Confusing situations are close.
I like the planning and this comes with some nice mechanics, like the way you sell the goods.

This game impressed me greatly on my first play. It's very heavy and pretty dry, par for the course for a euro. That said, the mechanics are interesting and so (surprisingly) is the theme. Build a business from the "Ground Floor" you start with a unique improvement making a certain business-related action easier for you. Build your building up, giving you more options and power and try to get your goods to market and sell them. It's not... "fun", but it is satisfying.

Tight worker placement game, with some nice touches.  One of the things that I like best is the fact that having more workers costs you more money, so it's actually feasible to not pursue a 'more workers' strategy.  Usually gaining more workers in a worker placement game is a win/win.

Excellent components.

If this game has been released ten years ago it would probably be in the top ten on BGG.  As it is, it's just another well-designed Euro with a few different paths to victory.  Don't get me wrong - this is a highly polished and very good game, it's just that the market is overcrowded with game like this.

Includes the 'Overfunding Achievements', of which I have a spare copy.

Very tight, heavy economic game. It's a bit hard to see how everything works together at first glance, but this game has a nice flow between the actions which just make sense, especially to business savvy players. It will definitely take at least one practice play or some excellent player aids before Ground Floor gets moving at a decent pace, but this one is well worth the entry barrier.

Worker placement, economic development. Nothing terribly new here, but all very nicely done. The modern theme is a change from all the over-used medieval-merchant stuff, and the rules and mechanisms mostly match up well with the theme. The production art is excellent. Reasonably good as a two-player game, unlike many games that make the claim but that really don't work well with two players.

Boring theme (at least to me), but this is really quite an interesting game with not just one, but several, really interesting tweaks to what at first appears to be fairly standard worker-placement mechanisms. But I've only ever played this twice, both in 2013 - and while I enjoyed the first game, the second, with a different group, did not go down particularly well, and I definitely enjoyed it less. While I do think it's quite a good game, it became apparent that it was never going to be played again in our group - so we sold it.

--Apr2013-- Rather longer (and more subject to post-action resolution randomness) than I might have preferred.  There are some cool mechanisms here; the market is delightfully nasty, for example.  I'd be more inclined to forgive the randomness if the game was 2h long; but at 5h, I'm inclined to prefer something with less accidental screwage.  I'd be content to play again, but I think I'm quite happy to not acquire a copy.

It feels churlish to give this well-engineered game only a 7, but in the end the theme cost it a point (I want to pilot a starship or toil on a medieval farm, not run a corporation!)  On the other hand, the "floors" were a genius bit of graphic design.
I was also slightly unnerved at almost winning a game in which I pretty much didn't interact with the other players at all after about round 2 - I did non-stop R&D and did no marketing and only a couple of small sales for cash flow.  I do wonder if I was missing something.  (I suspect it may have been that other players didn't make the most of my always being the last player in turn order.)

**Disclosure** I worked as the Game Developer on this game.

2/14/12: Long overdue update. This game has been finished for a while now, and is finally going to come out later this year (2012)!

It's become a very strong resource management game that I very much enjoy playing.

Old: This game is getting better and better. Hopefully David doesn't mind my meddling and pestering him to change certain things :)

12/18/09: Played a 2p game today with the latest rules... it worked well! Hard to tell if it'll still take too long with 4 players though.

Good game - lots of interesting decisions to make - theme fairly dry, but well integrated, so you do feel that you're building up your company, and competing in the market for sales and building company popularity and so on. 

Put it this way - I want to drastically trim my collection - this one is a keeper!

This game has a lot going on.  Resources are tight, which I normally really like in a game, but it's weird how they work in this one.  Info starts tight, then it seems that it switches to money becoming tight.  I thought it was ok, but my first play was with six and I certainly won't be repeating that.  Way too long with six for what you're getting out of it.  I'll try it again, but right now, it looks like it's headed for the trade pile.

I really enjoyed this - I played with 2 and 3 players.  With 3, popularity becomes more of a value ... I like worker (time) placement games and while this does a lot of the same things as other WP games - I'm so glad I own it now.  Not sure there are multiple paths to victory though ... you score for building stuff.  It feels more or less like a "race" game to get the best stuff at the construction outlet.  Still a very fun game.

Tight worker placement and resource management game.  The theme and mechanics work well together, the artwork is good, and the decisions are tough.  Rules are not overly complex, though.

Revised rating from 7 to 6 (2013)

Slightly dry worker placement game. Enjoyed it for quite some time (quite liked pretending we owned various corporations) but there just isn't enough there to keep things interesting. The decisions are rather one-dimensional and there's little player interaction. The theme is different, the components are gorgeous and the Kickstarter edition came with a free game! Very little to complain about really but it's just dryyyy.

This is a pretty long but interesting worker-placement economic game where you're building up an office building. Everyone starts with the ground floor, with 6 offices each of which give you a different ability. Players are randomly allocated to get the advanced form of one of these rooms. 

Each round, collect starting income -- varies based on your company size. Then, players take turns allocating action discs (you get more based on the number of employees you have). These can go on the main board, or in the offices of your own building. Actions are resolved only after all have been placed, and do a variety of things such as: earn money or information (the 2 currencies of the game), produce resource cubes, sell cubes, upgrade rooms (to better versions of the starting rooms), add floors, grow the company (get more action discs), etc. Selling of cubes and cost of employees is cleverly handled with a combination of 2 things:
- a random deck of economic forecast cards: each tells you the number of goods that will be purchased that round; it also affects the cost of employees that turn. 
- a supply grid, where players place their goods cubes at a price of their choosing; goods are sold from low price to high, up to the number dictated by the card. Any unsold goods drop in price.

The game ends at the end of the round in which any player builds the 6th floor. 

The economy is pretty cool and the game works well; but it was just so long! I don't mind a long game, but this game may be longer than it should be. Probably faster, though, with repeat play?

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed this game and I had never even heard of it until I played it.

The game is a reasonably deep worker placement game where players are competing to become the most successful business.  The main source of points in the game is building floors into your corporate building.  Each of these floors provides points and special abilities for the building player but costs quite a bit of resources as well and each floor requires more and more resources.

In service of building these floors there are a lot of things to consider.  There are two main resources to manage, money and information.  If you get a lot of one, most likely you will be short on the other and both are needed for almost everything.  You need to balance hiring more workers (and training them) for more actions but also affording to pay them all and have money left over to actually take those actions.  The primary way you make money is by producing and selling goods but to do this takes more resources and also considering the economic market.  Your company's popularity dictates turn order and also provides once-per-round special bonuses and determines which companies customers will buy goods from.  There's even a decent amount of interaction as you compete for popularity, actions spaces, customers, and those once-per-round bonuses.

Like I said, I quite enjoyed it.  There was a wealth of interesting decisions to be made and it would take many plays to mine out everything this game has to offer.  Very fine addition to the worker placement market.

A standard worker placement game made interesting by the economy deck that significantly changes the volume of money available to players. I like the spartan/modern art style though I don't doubt some people will find it dull. I thought there were one or two design flaws on the main game board relating to how your time(?) actions are placed and the interconnectedness of regions but once re-explained it works fine. My first few turns were utter pain as I wasn't getting the system but once it clicked I had a surprisingly good time.

RATING: 4.5
Visually, the game is superb, and it has a cool setting, but mechanically I think it falls short when compared to other worker placement games.  

In particular, I think it's inconsistent in terms of complexity.  Building your resource engine is a straight-forward affair (though there are a few ways you can go about it) and how to build towards victory points is completely apparent, but the mechanics for determining turn order is a convoluted and initially confusing mess that bogs down the pace of each round.  And turn order isn't even all that important (apart from the 7th round, when the limited bonus-scoring floors become available for purchase).  I'm not at all averse to complexity in games, but here it sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise simple ruleset.  Too bad, because I thought the rest of the game flowed pretty well.

Note: I've only played it once and it was at the end of a long day of gaming/travel, it was a 6-player learning game, and a few players had some major AP going on.  I'd be willing to accept that my first reaction was dampened by these other factors.

RATING: 8
A very heavy (pun intended) economic simulation game.  You spend time counters to generate money and information, which you use to purchase raw materials and eventually sell goods in the retail market.  Economic forcasts determine the number of consumers (and how much product will be sold) as well as the price of new employees available for hire.  As you progress you upgrade your office, and add new specialized floors to your building.  A very thematic game with beautiful components.

I've played this twice so far and I have to say it's awesome! There's just so much stuff to do and it's very hard to balance your resources and still manage to earn points. 
Another bonus point is the component and box quality. The game comes in a really sturdy, cool-looking box, and I can't say a single bad thing about the production quality of anything here.
The game art is also very good.
The only bad thing I can say is that the box says the playtime is 90-120 minutes, but one of my plays was over 3 hours and the other - over 4. While I don't mind longer games, I can't really see how this can play in the indicated time.

After my first play I am not disapointed. This is definately a heavy economic Euro with an amazingly well integrated theme. Many people will not like the theme (building a company), but there is no reasonable argument that it is not well integrated. Game rules and placement/scoring mechanisms all tie logically in an intuitive manner to the theme.

I found the game to be engaging and sufficiently complex to keep my attention for the duration (it is not a short game). Downtime can get rough as players increase employees and begin to analyze the various paths available for each round.

The end game becomes a mad scramble to build as much as possible in the last turn or two, but it is not a surprise (i.e.; you can plan for it).

I had some trepidations about this, as I had never heard of it before, and I have a rather healthy skepticism about Kickstarter games. Initially, it was a lot of information coming at me all at once and I wasn't taking it in very well. Chris was getting a little ticked that I kept asking stupid questions. Once we got past the rules and into the game though, things started making sense and I got a feel for the game.

And... I liked it. Quite a bit actually. This game is well designed. Thematically it's great and something a little novel. It's a riff on the classic building a tower motif, but it's building a corporate office building and all your builds fuel special corporate advantages as well as vp's. The game design is solid and all makes a lot of sense (except the round track, popularity track, etc weren't entirely clear at first, that's the only design element I think could really be improved). And the building tiles get the Bob Wilson stamp of approval (and he didn't even see the extra floors yet).

RATING: 7.5
[thing=38765][/thing] has so many things in it, that the only way I can give you a sense of the game is to enumerate the phases of a round, the standard actions in the players boards and the possible actions in the main board, without elaborate on them, after all, the explanation of the rules took no less than 1 whole hour.

Phases of turn:
- Receive income (money, time of employees, and folders/ideas);
- Hire employees (paying cash and folders/ideas according to the level of the market - the more hirings, more the value of new employees increases, as the market gets hotter);
- Schedule business (for actions done on the personal board you get the results at the same time, but for actions in the main board, they will be dealt in order, after all the employees time have been allocated). Also, the players can, anytime during this part of the phase, make one or more office remodel (which makes the actions in the personal board better);
- Conduct business (the actions are done, in order, on the main board);
- Reorganize:
a) downsize (by choice or obligation, if the player cannot pay the employees - in the highest level);
b) reset time markers (according to number of employees);
c) Update boards:
c.1) stock the warehouses;
c.2) adjust popularity (everyone descend one space);
c.3) assess job market (adjust how many unemployed workers will reach the market);
c.4) forecast economy (this gives an indication of how much products will be sold in the retail outlets).

The default actions that can be done in the personal boards are:
- Assembly (produces products for sales/trades);
- Training (makes a new employee becine an asset within the company - his/her time will be avaiable in the next round);
- Storage closet (not an action, just a space to store the resource produced by the action of assembly);
- Meeting Room (produces folders - which represents ideas, information);
- Research & testing (transforms the resources produced into folders/ideas);
- Advertising (makes networking, which can increase the popularity of the company/product).

The actions that can be done on the main board are:
- Consulting firm (which may ultimately generate folders/ideas);
- Advertising agency (have three ways to act: networking, print or broadcast - the three work in different ways: networking requires more time put into it to work; broadcast gives imediate increase in popularity, but it costs money and ideas);
- Marketing bonus (the most popular companies/products receive a bonus, chosen in order of popularity);
- Warehouse (by paying cash or information, the company gets products to develop/sell/trade later) ;
- Factory (which produces the product that maybe sold in the next action);
- Retail outlets (the players, in reverse order of position in the Factory - from last to first - put their products to be sold, and must take into consideration the forecast of the economy, trying to assess how many sales will happen - the companies with the most popular products sell first, when the products are in the same cost grade);
- Construction company (the buliding of tenant improvements or the building/acquisition of new floors, which allows the company to have new or better actions).

Simple, no?

Well, the rules themselves are not the most complex, but the interactions between many of them, especially the consideration of time and cost required to perform certain actions, makes the decisions harder to be made. Because it is necessary to weigh in the possibilities of the other players (how much time/resources they have), and also the order the choices will happen in the actions of the main board, the level of popularity of the other companies, and much more. This is a hevay game - so many possibilities and options.

[thing=38765][/thing] lasts for 9 rounds or up to when someone manages to include the 5th floor in his/her company (which, in our game, only happened in the 9th round - but I guess it can be done in less) - and, to translate in human time: around 210-240 minutes. The production value of the game is quite high, with components and pieces of remarkable quality.

Torn between a 6 and 7.  Kind of dull, but a great system, just a solid euro game.  Not an economic game at all.  A tight euro. 

At a certain point, why not just play Caylus?  

This one earns points for being super solid and being able to handle 6 with a relatively short playing time (2 hours).

But... it's just solid.  There is not much tension outside of budgeting the two resources.  You can jockey for board position a little bit, but it's kind of lame.

Not sure.  Rating might go up if I play it again.  For such a low rating I am sure interested in trying it more.

(Feb 2013 - after 1 play 4p) - This is a worker placement game set in modern times - no cavemen, no inventors, no fantasy setting.

The game plays very themeatically and builds up through the rounds.  There is a lot going on, but learning the mechanics was not too overwhelming.  Learning the interactions and how to build your "engine" might be a little trickier.   

I had a fun time with this one and think it might be much more "competitive" with 5 or 6 players.

體驗當老闆的辛苦，要錢要人要資訊，這三樣是遊戲中的主要支出與生產項目，要建設要知名度，這影響了公司的營運模式與市場接受度。
第一次玩，也沒當過老闆，會有一種不知所措的感覺，究竟要先找員工，還是賺錢賺資訊，一開始認為起步是重要的，但事實上方向很多元(圖板動作5個，公司的基本起始動作就有6個)，玩家間的競爭是一直在進行的(知名度、員工、金錢與資源)，不太會有滾雪球的狀況。
知名度的晉升是這遊戲的特色之ㄧ，是加分很多的機制。
知名度將造成在市場的強勢，像是口碑良好的好牌子，但要反轉這一切，並不是困難的。在遊戲中可能一不小心，就會造成空轉幾乎一回合，會有一種公司將至破產的錯覺 XD
但在後期，玩家們都成長的差不多時，本來應該競爭平凡的時期，卻種有一種不過癮，或是疲乏的狀態，這可能需要多玩幾次才會知道，這究竟是怎麼一回事。
是值得一試的好遊戲，講解時間約30~45分鐘，遊戲時間:30~45分鐘/人

First play:  Loved it.  Worker placement (time) to collect resources (money, information, and supplies) to earn more resources and buy floors in the building(victory points and additional actions/benefits).  The rules are simple, the rule book is clear, well written, and great examples.  The scope of components plus a big central board with some actions plus your private board with more actions was a little intimidating for the wife.  My 7 1/2 y/o son grasped it, and came in second place.  Great game for the non-confrontation-euro-worker placement fans.

Kickstarted

I do not know anything about running a business, but this game has put me close to feeling like I am doing just that...starting a business from the 'ground floor' and progressing through marketing, consulting, goods management, sales, etc., until I have myself a high-rise glass and concrete monument to my achievements.

When I play this game, I find the time goes by quickly...even though the game itself does not. It can run about a couple of hours, but there seems to be little downtime and I am always thinking ahead, so my engagement in the game keeps me occupied until I am active. 

"Ground Floor" is also impressive in how each thing I decide to invest time into affects other elements of the game. Finding truly good combinations of upgrades (remodeled rooms/floors), with special abilities afforded by those same upgrades is part of the attraction of this game.

I would recommend this game to a euro gamer who enjoys planning and who is drawn to the theme of Big business.

Good worker placement game. Interesting choices using the business model. I like the consultation system and the selling goods especially.

Nothing particularly innovative, but the pieces fit together well enough.

The game was interesting and pretty thematic, but too long with five players.  Might be good with three.  Tight economy without being ridiculous.

Seems like a very solid game on initial play. Plenty to think about and interesting decisions most of the game.

For a business major who loves WP games, this might just be the perfect combo. Great game and happy I kickstarted.

Excellent business game. Played twice.  Takes a long time to play though

Long, complex game, whose rules are not so difficult (I learned it starting at my bedtime, and still managed 2nd place out of 5 players), but whose large decisions are wonderfully tough, but comprise numerous smaller, easier decisions.  Thus, the pace of the game is not too bad.  I suspect that someone afflicted with analysis paralysis might make this game misery, but even with 4½ new players (the game-teacher had done most of a solitaire 4p) working very hard to play well, our first game was only three hours, and every second of it was challenging!

I'd like to see a short-play variant posted down the line, for those times when you want the intensity, but don't have the time; however, I think that like [thing=42052][/thing], once all your players have played it several times, the game length will make a sudden drop of surprising magnitude.  I think it will be a smaller percentage reduction in this one than in Vinhos, but still significant.

Also, I love the way the component design enhances the experience!

Only issue is that player that fall behind seem to be stuck behind.  I've only played one game with 5 players, I think it may be better with 3-4

Some nice elements, but too long, and didn't like the market element.

Little known gem of a worker placement game. Game's largest fault is it's a little too 'on the nose' theme-wise. Not everyone wants to be a business manager on their day off :)

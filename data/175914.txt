I'm going to declare this as my first ever 10 on BGG!  Which will also make this my #1 game and the game I am always wanting to play.  Would also like to try it with 4-5 players to see how it scales and plays out on the bigger board.  So much depth, yet so simple to play and everything just makes sense and plays out very well!

I understand where others say "it's a drafting game that you don't know what you're building towards" which I think holds a large amount of truth in it in terms of how to approach the initial 1/3rd of the game (if not longer) with the accumulation of workers for your economic engine of sorts. There is probably 1/3rd of the game where you're focused on cards and getting started on the board, but determining what to do there falls out of a co-dependency with other players (as does when to have that switch in focus and balance). There is a certain amount of an engine building or a workforce management that you work on at the beginning and then there is this transition into board focused spatial play. In that regard, it sort of reminds me of a more complicated Lewis & Clark with staffing and card usage each turn with the spatial piece of The Great Zimbabwe added in and a slathering of generic euro engine building layed on top. One area that it different from TGZ is there seems to be a certain amount of runaway/snowball effect that the milestones provoke and the underlying question is "who can runaway faster" as the end post you're reaching for doesn't change, so delaying getting a milestone isn't to your benefit if you're going to try and incorporate it into your strategy. Conversely, because anyone who meets a milestone's condition that turn receives it, there is a dominant pathway of recruitment that provides for an advantage..

Compared to Indonesia (the other heavy econ Splotter I have), this feels slightly more tactical, much more euro-y (build some semblance of an engine, crank it as hard as possible, try and run away with it, etc), less permanent (due to how marketing happens and things sort of turn quickly as a result of changed demands and a better ability to forecast what's coming) and less opaque in it's decision analysis. I would say it's less opaque as well in terms of just saying "well is this a good idea or no?" By no means is it a simple game, just a general comparison of the two titles (not all of that is bad, just different). 

Conversely, the plethora of things you can do is almost dizzying in a wonderful way, even if there are two areas of strategic pivoting (once at the onset of the game, and again after about 8 turns when everyone is up and running for a bit). It is much more dynamic with price cutting/raising and changing demand via marketing expiration piece make for a really interesting twist on interaction, and I find it more interactive than either Indonesia or Roads & Boats. Slightly stronger 7 than Roads & Boats (primarily due to interaction and play duration), not nearly as interesting to me as Indonesia (which I say is a 9). It rises above "generic heavy euro" but not by much.

Our favorite game of 2015. We couldn't stop playing, it's hugely compulsive.  Even yesterday we played 3 games one after the other (each lasting about 2 hours with 3 players and $800-900 in the reserve). I'm already looking forward to our next play.

There are so many options - in our very first game we found it slightly daunting and difficult to know which way to jump: there are a huge number of combinations of staff and milestones to consider. But one game is enough to give you a grasp on the roles available and the significance of the milestone bonuses.

The randomly generated map and the dynamic nature of the marketing campaigns and property development means you get a different game experience each time and opportunities to try out different strategies. But it is certainly the case that bad choices made in the first couple of turns could see you struggle for the whole rest of the game.

RATING: 9.5
Lots of intro games played, have yet to go on to play a full game in person, but can't wait to. We're just getting started with this one! 

A surprisingly easy to pick up economic game with a great theme and lots of depth. The wide array of recruitment options gives a sandboxy feel and you can get quite creative with strategies. Later on things get more involved with more demands flying around and people's rosters growing, but it never feels bogged down. 

A modern classic, could climb higher.

edit: the full game is very satisfying indeed, can't wait to play more.

So, how surprised am I that I like this game? Pretty surprised! About the third turn in I thought I might hyperventilate - what do I do? What do I do? I forced myself to take a deep breath. You're learning. It's OK. Just try something. Very, very fun. I have a plan for which employee I'll hire first next time.

Finally got the chance to try this game. It's just not for me. The design is too harsh & unforgiving. This is a game where the more experienced player is guaranteed to win, and I understand some enjoy that, but I wasn't particularly thrilled with that. You can literally lose this game on the first turn (...and every turn after that), but you continue playing. Additionally, the game is extremely hostile and I felt there was no way for anyone to get ahead without harming another player. Most of the game comes down to mathematical calculations, which I found rather dull. That said, it's a well-designed, excellent game. I'd recommend it to the right person and I understand why so many folks love it. The low rating is based on how hard it'd be to get me personally to play the game again & how little I enjoy it; it's not a reflection of whether I think it is a good game (which I think it is).

RATING: 6
2.5 plays / 3,4 players (0.5 Intro play)

LIKE: Deep, deep game. Interesting theme. I enjoyed the first-to-get milestones. I also enjoyed how marketing was used to game demand, based on area and duration, it added some interesting aspects.

DISLIKE: Can be cutthroat, and players can get shut out to the point of being eliminated, because better efficiency from an opponent can cause a downward spiral for other players. It's a medium-long game, but manageable with 3 players. Fiddly towards the end, moving tokens and counting cash. Can be a table hog. Employee combos need to be known to play well against experienced players.

OVERALL: A good game, but I feel the all-or-nothing aspect of food deliveries is too punishing for this length of a game. I wish some of the bookkeeping was smoother, the CFO slows the game way down. I like The Great Zimbabwe better because of the shorter setup time and smaller table space. Getting efficient trainers seemed almost essential for a long game, but I do like to see if there's alternative strategies.

[2-5] An incredible game that pushes the players to balance a wide range of processes (food production, marketing, networks, payroll, tech/training tree, discounting, etc) and really makes the brain burn! I love the art direction and the ways in which the mechanics are all in support of the larger thematic play. On our first day we played two introductory games followed by a full play. We loved it.

RATING: 6
A deep game that does not disappoint strategy and theme wise as usual from Splotter but this is probably the best game in my experience that they have produced. Not only does everything immerse you into the idea of running a food chain but the strategy you go down can sink you just like in real life if one lacks the ability to adapt to a changing market. The rules are the biggest surprise as usually Splotter games are very complex to teach but this game was quick and easy to learn for anyone of a regular boardgaming level. And the way of choosing facedown by each player the length of the game by the variable amount of money in the bank needed to exhaust to end the game adds a whole new level to strategy than just a standard amount of turns. Also, running a food chain is a unique theme that is fun to roleplay if one is so inclined. 

Downsides is the game can be brutal and one can find a downward spiral of dropping behind the leader if a decision was not thought out far enough. The game also takes a while to play, 2-4hrs depending on player count. 

In conclusion, a great game with immense theme and strategy to boot. Can't recommend it enough with it's cool theme and fun gameplay.

RATING: 9
Wow!  What a great game!  It's an interesting exploration of supply/demand.  One unique element is that players must provide or establish both the supply AND the demand.  The tech tree of the employees creates a number of additional strategies and opportunities that interlace with the supply/demand underpinning.  This leads to some complicated interactions and extremely provocative timing considerations since there are inherent delays in most everything (especially the demand side).

One criticism is the play time and that's pretty inherent to the overall engine.  I'd be reluctant to engage in a 5-player enterprise, though one key part of the turn is simultaneous and many other parts are automated (still, players will respond to other's actions, leading to the potential for significant delays).

Another criticism is the components.  Rather low production value for the price, but then it is a Splotter and the game is more than good enough to get over this hurdle.

I have a few longer, heavier games that I absolutely love and it tends to be the game length that is prohibitive in getting them to the table.  I will pick up a copy of Food Chain Magnate and I expect it will fall into this category.  It's an excellent euro that you really should try.

This one is a very good surprise. Ok, not so surprise at all since it is a Splotter game and what I played from them (Just Antiquity) is amazing. They really know how to hit the people. This game has a lot of paths to make your way to the top and a lot of information, the game is punishing, but in the end it is very fluid and usually you know what you want to do. I played 2 times and I'm very satisfied with the results of my food chain.

This game is fucking incredible. You need to play it a couple times before you understand why, but once you see the way everything works, and the myriad of paths open to you, the playground it offers is just SO damn perfect and enticing. Seriously great design. You can LOSE this game, which makes some people sad, but just concede and run it back (while keeping in mind that it is possible to come back late, just not probably until you've played a few times)

I have the bgg accordion/whiteboard pack. I drew the missing infinity symbol on the back of tile 1, because I'm not a monster who needs it reshipped from the netherlands for something so minor

Excellent heavy game, with a good pace and lots of player interaction.  Unfortunately it's extremely unforgiving so newer players or players who make a tempo-related mistake can simply be eliminated in favor of people who didn't - that said, it's definitely an expected and reasonable feature if you know that's what you're in for.

The theming works really, really well and the graphic design of the cards is fantastic (the board's pretty barebones but it works).

One of my favourite games. Vastly variable set-up although the opening strategies can get a bit limited as you gain in experience, it's very open-ended once you get going.

Try and stay at the same experience level as your play group or you might find you outclass them and it's difficult to handicap. There's no catch-up mechanism and it's not terribly forgiving for the inexperienced or if you make a mistake. If everyone is playing at the same level however it's a fantastic game for all involved.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game, and I did.  At least until half way through the game when we discovered that the game had a huge and utterly ridiculous design flaw, which entirely ruined it.

It's possible to spend half of the game building a perfectly good engine for making money, only to have someone - in a single move - completely destroy that engine for the game.

This isn't just bad planning, mistakes or bad luck - this is just a basic flaw in the design of the game.  

In our very first play, we had a situation where a player was competitive for the first half of the game - but one move by another player just killed the game for that player (and it wasn't even remotely aimed at hurting the player), who then spent the second half (about an hour and a half) of the game losing money (no matter what they did) and it was really obvious as soon as it happened that this was going to be the case.

Apologists for this horribly overrated game will argue that you can avoid this situation [i]once you know about it[/i], but you shouldn't have to [i]plan[/i] to avoid a clear flaw in the game.

Long games with such a huge flaw should be avoided like the plague...

Ok, I should know better, but after a fairly brutal first game I'm going to rate this one as there isn't a huge desire to play again - too long & too much downtime, which I don't see improving significantly with familiarity. It's undoubtedly clever, and has some wickedly humorous touches regarding market forces & competition, but for me  it felt too big and sprawling. My other main gripes are that the milestones and single availability cards simply rankled, as did the forced completion of full orders -  customers might see advertising for beer, burgers and pizza, but should they really have to buy them all or not buy anything?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with the milestones despite being my first game and managed a narrow win. Very thinky, heavy and absolutely brutal if you make mistakes. Really like it. The paper money and the board stink... But it's a quality game.

Edit: the £69.99 RRP for this price is wholly unacceptable when it has paper money and really mediocre board tiles. This is a shame as I love the card and "player menu" design as well as the wooden components. And the gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. But I doubt I'd pick up a copy of this at that price.

This game has everything a great game needs. Great replayability, loads of strategy, a ton of player interaction. 
This is a no luck 100% strategy game, and it can be extremely non forgiving. Also, this game should never ever ever be played with ppl who do not like confrontational games or take games too seriously. You will screw players over and you will get screwed yourself after loads of planning and preparation.

No soy un jugador de Euros pesados, pero este juego está increiblemente bien hecho. Es un euro pero con un tema que se respira en el aire, es muy temático después de todo.

Es un juego con mecánicas no tan complicadas para comenzar, pero con una profundidad estratégica increible. Y puedes haber jugado un par de partidas, pero el juego cambia mucho con cada mapa, por lo tanto no existe estrategia ganadora única, y pueden ganar jugadores que no lo han jugado antes.

La estética de todo calza perfecto, lo único que choca al inicio es lo feo del tablero (hay que ser sincero), pero después te acostumbras y vez que todo calza.

Simplemente me fascina.

On the box it says 100% dice free, which is exactly why this game appealed to me. The only randomness in this game is during setup, which can be quite random and lead to some very interesting scenarios. Once you've gotten over this bit of chaos the only other factor that can destroy your plans are your opponents. It is one of the most competitive games I've played. There is a big difference to being an experienced and a new player in this, as new players are bound to make oversights in a game that has so many equally important decisions.

This game is not a 10 to me as it is simply too heavy and too long to get to the table regularly. Which is a shame as I adore it to bits.

While there is an economic element to this game, the logistic and drafting elements are the most defining and influential ones. This is a game about creating demand and fulfilling that demand to earn money, which is essentially victory points. To do both things efficiently, players must draft and upgrade their employees, which are represented by cards. But that is only half of the puzzle... the other half lies with the abstract/logistic nature of the game board, which dictates the access/distance between players' restaurants and the houses/vendors. 

Furthermore, this is a VERY interactive euro. There is no safe-place in Food Chain Magnate... players can undercut you, advertise products that you can't fulfill, and deny you access to high-tier employees. This is a game where a single mistake can have a domino effect where you end up firing your high-tier employees, which took you several turns to train. And there are no catch up mechanics in this 3+ hour game. 

And like other Splotter titles, this game is very low luck. In the beginning of each round, the cards/employees that players choose are done by simultaneous action selection. And while this may seem like rock-paper-scissors... in reality, players know what others are attempting as everything is drafted/upgraded openly. Furthermore, because high-tier employees cost salaries, it's rare that someone would have so much flexibility that you couldn't make an educated guess on what they would play. And even if they did, you can manipulate turn order by having empty employee slots.

The last element, which I really like about Food Chain Magnate, are the milestones. Basically, these are bonuses that are given to players who are first to accomplish one thing or another. And these bonuses become unavailable after the round in which they are first obtained. Functionally, these milestones create a focal point, which creates tension, and encourages player to adopt different strategies. 

Overall, this cut-throat interactive euro isn't going to be for everyone... but it is the type of game that I love to play. And perhaps most impressively, the game isn't that complicated compared to the meaty decisions it manages to create. This isn't a relaxing walk in the park... this is a walk in a mine field. 

That being said, the game isn't without criticism. From a mechanical point of view, there is little I can find fault in. The most notable criticism would be that the game can slow down with intense competition. But from a component point of view, Splotter has made some bewildering publishing decisions...
• The milestones should have never been printed on cards. It makes an already cluttered game even more cluttered.
• There is a good chance that goods will run out in the game. Food tracks should have been included. Furthermore, food tracks make the game less fiddly as players are often obtaining/discarding food. 
• The cards should have had iconography on the right/left borders so players can see them while splayed out. Trying to plan your turn, with 20+ some cards, is simply obnoxious without laying everything in the open (and of course, this is suppose to be done in secret). 

In the end, Splotter delivers substandard component quality at a huge premium. Many people defend their component quality by highlighting how rare/niche their games are. But with so many heavy euros coming out each year,... with much better components and lower prices... I don't quite buy it. Simply put, I think Splotter is stuck in the past, which is preventing their designs from reaching their full potential.

Tough decisions and great gameplay.  Actually I thought it was quite easy to learn (I did not read the rulebook the game was taught to me). Sure it can be intimidating but the game is tons of fun.

Has not hit the table enough.

My first splotter game and I really really love it.  Mean, challenging, and unforgiving, but so rich in decisions (and theme).  There is something really satisfying about managing a huge stable of employees who all specialize in different things.  The milestones are also a real stroke of genius and really make for juicy decisions opportunities.  

Can't wait to play more.

Nagyon régen éreztem magam ennyire bénának egy játékban, de lehet hogy csak azért, mert a játék nagyon bünteti a hibákat, amikből pedig elkövettem néhányat. 
A szerzők komplexitást tekintve nem hazudtolták meg magukat, bár ez könnyebb kicsit, mint az eddig általam próbált 2 játékuk. Egyébként ez az Indonesia-nál kicsit jobban tetszett a téma miatt, de az Antiquity-t nem veri.

Pozitívumok: van rövidített mód... akit esetleg riasztanak a szerzők 4.2 nehézségű 5-6 órás játékai, azoknak jó hír, hogy itt van egyszerűsített változat is. Mi csak a pénzmennyiséget csökkentettük, egyébként teljeset játszottunk, de még így is 3 óra volt tisztán 4 fővel (plusz másfél óra szabály), hogy a maximális 1400 pénz helyett csak 300 volt játékban. Nagyon ötletes egyébként a teljes játékváltozatban a pénzösszeg meghatározási módja, még sehol nem láttam hasonlót: a játékosok titkosan közösen határozzák meg, hogy mennyi pénz kerüljön a játékba (mindenki választ előre megadott összegekből, és ezeket összeadjuk). A szerepek többsége tematikus, de a marketing kampányok a legjobbak, a repülős meg a adóvevős pl. tök eredeti.

Negatívumok: nem a legszebb játék. Mint már írtam nagyon durván bünteti a hibát, az elején fonalasan hátrányba lehet kerülni, bár a mi partink alapján ez le is dolgozható. AP veszély hatalmas, sorszáma van a házaknak, a kampányoknak (amik ez alapján következnek), számítanak a távolságok, bármikor le lehet rakni új éttermet, új házat, ami felborít mindent... 5 játékosnál mondjuk a 10-dik körben, amikor 30 kaja kerül fel körönként a keresleti meg kínálati oldalon is és mindenkinek van 20 embere... nem is folytatom:) Ja, és a felüljárók grafikája zavaró, mármint hogy nem lehet elmenni alattuk.

Akit nem riaszt az AP, és az hogy szívatós tud lenni a játék, annak ajánlom feltétlenül, tényleg nagyon jól össze van rakva, pár apró hibát leszámítva tök jó játék szerintem.

Food Chain Magnate is an economic gamer's game about the fast food industry, set in the United States in the 50s.
It has two main mechanics: it is a drafting game, where each player must react to others' actions and the objective becomes manifest while playing; but it has also a very strong spatial element, conveyed by a modular board (giving each game a very different feel).
It has a steep learning curve (and mistakes are paid harshly: the game is very unforgiving!) and the downtime between turns can be quite long. Apart from these drawbacks, it is a very very solid economic game, with a sandbox approach. One of the best of the past year.

Initial Impression: Although the components of this game feel like one step up from prototype, I like the clipart used for the cards and absolutely LOVE the menu Player Aid. This is the way all games should do player aids. Overall, this game has many interesting decisions and paths to victory. Not only is player turn order important, anticipating opponents' actions is vital to acquiring milestones. This will undoubtedly shape your strategy throughout the game. I've only played once so far but find myself frequently thinking about the game and the  possibilities it provides.

I've played 4 player once and 2 player about 5 times so far. I find that the strategies are totally different, which makes playing with different numbers of people really interesting. Working out how to try and create demand for only one type of good so you can out supply your competitors is definitely difficult and the milestones change up the game a lot. I love the art style, it's beautiful and you can make so many jokes behind the art, little things like the women are the low level cooks and the men are the expert chefs. All the women are HR and all the Men are management, really encapsulates the 50s era.

I would recommend this for people who like resource management games with no chance elements and that have played board games before. This is not an entry level game. I think its best played with 3 or 4 as you essentially have to copy the player in a 2 player game or fall very far behind.

Sidenote: We felt we had to Nerf the Guru in a 2 player or the person who got him would dominate the game every time. We changed him to only be able to upgrade a single person twice but still have 3 possible upgrades.

Probably the best game of the year. Heavy, many different strategies and mean gameplay. It may have a problem of lacking a catch up mechanism. Players may be out if game to early in the game. 

Updated: lower my rating 
 from 9 to 6.5. Played this game 3 more times, and we did not finished none, because at middle game one player had the lead and everybody knew he will be the winner. This game has a very serious problem of run way leader, and the richest gets richer even with players at the same level, and does not have any catch up mechanism. I will play one more time, but if this happens again, I will sell my game and lower my rating. Its only me the only one who sees it?

Updated: each time I played it the less I like this game.

RATING: 7.5
First Play: Watched the Shut up & Sit Down video and was surprised and encouraged when they said that the game mechanics were simple and quick to pick up. After my first game I must say that this impression is very misleading. Why?

Well OK there are some very simple and regimented steps to each turn but the options   are vast, first with regard to who to recruit and the branches that stem from those early decisions. Those decisions impact on the milestones that are achieved and they have knock on effects for cash for the rest of the game. It's fair to say that you can lose this game in the first 3-4 turns. 

As a result game #1 is a learning game. Gaining the global understanding of how it all hangs together took me 75% of the game. At that point I was earning $20 a turn whilst the experienced players were hauling in >$100. I suggest that a dummy round is a very good idea, maybe two, just to see how the milestones are earned and the importance of recruitment and training. 

I really want to play this again but this is a painful example of a game where experienced players will utterly wipe the floor with first timers. First timers need to be warned of this and given as much pre-game strategy advice as is feasible.

A fantastic game about producing food to meet demand in your neighborhood. This is a game that isn't heavy on the rules but has so many different choices and different paths to victory that every turn matters. The game is brutal and so making a poor choice could set you back significantly possibly with no hope of ever coming back. It demands that you watch what other players are doing both on the board and with their employees and that you react appropriately. Stubbornly sticking to any single strategy will mean a guaranteed loss. The game just gives you the sandbox to play with and you and your fellow players are free to run your food empire however you like within it. 

An instant hit for me. The light rules, high interaction, multiple victory paths, and even the theme are just perfect. Due to the fact that the players really dictate how this game flows, that also means if you're playing a game with people of different experience levels it's going to really throw the balance of the game off. Not uncommon for bigger games but FCM seems like it would be especially prone to that. However, if you play this with other "serious" board gamers it's an awesome experience.

If I could marry a board game, I would convince my wife to move to Utah (where polygamy is still a thing), and live in some strange union, with some gaming buddies thrown in.

Barring some kind of dominant strategy, this has the potential to unseat Princes of the Renaissance, which already disintegrates my scale, as my favorite game. Just impossible to get this out of your mind. Seemingly limitless openings for creative play.

This was the game we were waiting for our third player (Sander) to arrive. An incredibly tight, vicious economic game where you can literally be out of contention in the first turn. Placement of restaurants is key. Brian dominated by basically hiring like crazy the first 8 turns or so while Sander and I finished small orders. Brian was then able to steal our customers with his multiple Discounts. So many strategies are forming in my head as I write this. Never place Marketing, let the other players do it. Get the Fridge Milestone. Go for super discounted food. This is the real deal heavy game. Splotter continues its impressive run of gaming (to me at least). Roads & Boats and now this. Indonesia is coming soon, can't wait!!!

Two playings, felt MUCH more in tune with the game on the second play than the first.  Worth noting my first play was with several experienced players (5 player game) and I was the most experienced in my second play (4 player game).  Very eager to play again, though I have a worry that at this point I largely grok the strategies.  Still, there appear to be a lot of situational tactics yet to uncover, and seems there may be sufficient variety both in board configuration and in other player's actions that the game will stay interesting for quite a few more plays.

Initial impressions:

Interesting game.  The most superficial complexity I've seen in a Splotter...ever, or perhaps on par with Antiquity.  This is probably a deeper game, which is a good thing.

Many aspects of other Splotters are present here, the most obvious being from TGZ, but major overlap also with Duck Dealer.  The hand management system would be better with a +1/+2/+N number at the base of the black cards, so you can simply mentally think 3+1+2+2=8 cards, rather than forcing a summation of N-1 approach - it's just an extra bit of overhead mental arithmetic when I'd rather focus on the game.  Similarly, either a player board with the milestones and cubes/squares to indicate which ones you have rather than a handful of cards which can be hard to see in a glance, as well as a board to track how many waitresses and price discounters and drinks/food a player could maximally play, would help a lot.  But perhaps the components for these would be cost-prohibitive.

I found the components and color palette absolutely gorgeous here, from the board to the menu to the card art style.  I'm really not sure what anyone has to complain about.  I've had some difficulty mapping restaurants to their owners however.

As for the game itself, there is a good deal going on - there are a lot of tempo plays and long-term strategic decisions early, which shifts to an almost entirely tactical game with few decisions for the last 3-4 turns as you are carried by the momentum of what you have chosen at the start.  It's all just posturing and trying to eek out that small edge over the competition at this point.

Milestones are incredibly important, some are so important that you can lose the game simply by not achieving one in time, depending on your focus.  I'm not sure how I ultimately feel about these, I'm never much of a fan of all-or-nothing mechanics.  It is the weakest part of the game for me.  I would rather see something where you the first to achieve gets the full bonus, then the next turn "half" the bonus, and finally it is removed.

Anyway, it is an interesting and exciting game which will warrant exploration for a dozen or so plays, at least.  Rating could climb to a 9, or could drop to a 6, depending on how my dissatisfaction with the milestones progresses over time.  Probably not going beneath a 4, probably not going to be in my top 10.

RATING: 8
I had been looking quite forward to playing this as it has achieved almost legendary status in heavy eurogame circles in no time at all.

Be aware that this game is a major tablehog! Be aware that this game is unforgiving! For instance, the guy who first gets to earn $100 get a free CFO, which increases his earning a further 50% on subsequent turns. No catch-up mechanisms here. If someone is pulling ahead you need to focus on eliminating his income possibilities.

I find it quite interesting that an economic game like this can be meaner than many of the ameritrashy games out there.

Anyway, this an extremely well designed game that plays differently to anything else I have tried. It is mechanically simple, but you have a ton of options and timing your actions properly is difficult and brainburny. Recommended for heavy gamers, but probably not for most other people.

I like the idea, especially how players build their management team and I look forward to exploring that more. Overall, I'm not sure this will be a game that I am excited to play over and over again. It is very long and also includes a heavy dose of confrontation and "stealing" near the end. The stealing has more to do with adding products to stores to lock others out of selling to them. I can handle that just fine, I'm just not sure I really want to deal with it. That's especially true when the game lasts 2+ hours.

Really good economic game. The flow of the game could me more elegant and there is a lot to organize (shifting cards, placing wooden tokens, ...) every round.

Original and, potentially, brutal game.  This is definitely not multi-player solitaire.  The ramp up is gentle but once things get going, the competition takes off like a rocket.  Money will be disappearing left and right while you scramble to meet needs, gain an advantage over your competitors through clever marketing and hiring, and deploy new restaurants or homes.

Yes, the board is bland (but effective).  But the rest of the game design is quite clever. 

It's a brilliant, highly original, and unforgiving game.

This game is absolutely fantastic. And deceptively simple. Your hire some dudes, and then you play these dudes in a tree-like fashion in order to get every ability they allow. And if your the first to get some of these abilities played, you get extra special abilities that will change the way you play. That's it.

But then this game is all about reacting to what your friends are doing to the game. There's so many different ways to win it all but it always adjusts depending on the state of the board and what cards everyone has access to. Because of this, you end up watching everyone one pretty intensely and your always engaged - but your never waiting for long because turns are really short.

---

Bumped this down a couple ratings because I never get to play this anymore. It's just too long and the fun is VERY group-dependent...Some people just can't wrap their head around it. Coupled with the fact that this game is so punishing if your not good, this has lead to some real lackluster games.

So I'm at a conflicting point with this game. I love what this game is and can be with fellow players who are bright and engaged...But if it weren't so much on the rare and expensive side of things, I'd perhaps consider selling it

I really enjoy the card play and engine building in this game. Sadly, my wife is turned off by the bland board art and indeterminate game length. It is hard to talk her into a game at all. My only concern is the scripting of the opening moves in a 2 player game. The general consensus appears to be that there is a clear opening strategy that must be followed to be competitive at all. That disappoints me a bit and ruins the true "sandbox" nature of the game for me. This hold the game back a bit in my eyes.

Five plays in, the game is really starting to unfold in some really interesting ways. So far the reaction from playgroups has been positive, with only two players from a really one sided play not satisfied. 

That play had an inverse effect on me however, it really made it apparent to me how many different paths to victory there are and how important every single move you make is. You're mistakes hold you back while propelling your opponent forward, and good decisions can't be overcome by suboptimal plays.

The biggest flaw of this game is its steep learning curve. This steep learning curve coupled with the unforgiving nature of the game can be a problem for some, but if you're okay with hitting the ground a few times before you can fly then it's almost a moot point.

Whoa! This is definitely the heaviest strategy game I've ever played in my life. Chvatil's Civilization is not that heavy... I thought this is not possible before I finally have played FCM. Very mean game with negative interaction all the time. Very brain burning, very difficult to start. But this is kind of the game that give You satisfaction every time You sell something and when You beat Your rivals which is super hard to do. I love USA so when I saw that game designers decided to put this idea in 50's in USA I knew it is no brainer for me and I need this so badly. Great game!

Game design that makes me angry:
 - While it's an interesting twist to have players choose either a longer, medium or shorter game via hidden reserve cards, that's pointless because it's your first action in the game and can't be interacted later. You should not incorporate a Rock-Paper-Scissor mechanic in a long strategy game! You might guess the other players' reserve cards, but you have already had to commit to a certain build order. Some build orders can branch later, some can't. So you'd choose a build order that can branch, but there's one answer to every gamestate how you should branch so where's the game in that? It's more of a work situation, you shouldn't play by intuition. Game design that awards AP! Hurray!
 - The game is NOT interactive, but a race! It's just that some BOs (build orders) require certain other players to do something first to work (which you can't plan for). The seemingly tactical gameplay is overshadowed by the power of 1x employees and milestones, which are way more gamedeciding than careful tile-placement and opponent interaction.
 - The game is 100% open information. You can sit down and calculate your way to victory. You actually should. This makes it similar to chess, but without focus on tactical positioning, which is mostly irrelevant! What is the board for anyway? There's much added complexity without much gain.

Brilliant thematic pure strategy beast. Tons of fun and painfully delicious choices.  Surprising in all the best ways.

Hard and rather long, sometimes creates noticeable downtime. Interaction seems low, but it's just cleverly hidden in game mechanic: every turn you may steal customers from all across the board.

This is a game that I think about often between gaming sessions.  For it to do that, I give it a high rating.  

Update: lowering rating slightly.  After many plays, the 'endless possibilities' and strategies stopped seeming endless.  I think you reach the point where everyone becomes aware of what moves there, how to counter, and the counters to the counters.  Still a great game, but now its all about moves and countermoves, and guessing at what your opponents will do.

5x5 2017.  Really interesting combination of sort-of deckbuilding/tech tree and sort-of pick-up-deliver route stuff.  There's a lot of complexity but after a couple games it's pretty easy to get the hang of it although it is punishing if you don't know what you're doing.    I like the variable board set up and games do play out pretty differently depending on your opponents and the board.  Meaty, deep, strategic, and really good.  Despite all this, the game is heavy enough that, while my groups can play it fine, they have trouble playing it well.  And it's an issue because the game is long, takes practice, and more experienced/better players will definitely win so it's a tricky game to get to the table and actually have a competitive game.

Shamelessly stolen from a geekbuddy...

It's a drafting game where the desired object is only gradually manifested through the play of others. I often felt like I was building a car while not knowing exactly what course it would have to run. The Milestones provide some nice strategic pressure, and, of course, in my own car building I was determining the course as well. The balance between overarching strategy and tactical maneuver is fabulous (especially because tactical pivoting can be drafted as well). Couple that drafting game with a killer spatial element, and I think Splotter may have its best game yet.

Una delicia de juego. Cada jugador gestiona una cadena de comida rápida. Es muy interesante cómo se seleccionan las acciones. Se trata de formar una jerarquía de trabajo con cartas  y cada carta permite hacer una acción. Hay contratadores, productores (de bebida y comida), entrenadores (para subir de nivel el resto de las cartas) y un largo etc. Además, hay una serie de bonus que premian cumplir determinada condición y una vez que se otorgan (a quienes cumplan la condición en el mismo turno) ya no están disponibles en el juego. La ayuda tiene pinta de menú de hamburguesería. Luego hay un sistema para generar demanda (mediante campañas de marketing). Muy completo y entretenido. Un auténtico rompecabezas. Eso sí, penaliza mucho los errores... y cuanto antes se produzcan, peor. Yo de momento he jugado una partida, y en el primer turno ya me quedé sin opciones. Solo apto para jugones. Te puede explotar la cabeza. Es un juegazo.

Heavy.

Key points: Streamlined (for its weight), fun theme (and good use of its budget art), deep, full of conflict, no luck (though simultaneous actions), good arc progression, punishing, works well with 2, and plenty of breadth in your strategic options.

RATING: 7
It was pretty solid. The game played fairly smoothly once it was set up, in spite of the large number of components. I liked the mechanic of competing for customers, and how your advertisements could end up generating profit for someone else if you weren't careful. 

I suspect anything but the shortest version would be way too long for me. Even that dragged a little bit.

While this is certainly a well-crafted game, I think games that just feel like math puzzles are not that exciting to me. I need a significant element of randomness for replayability, fun, and excitement. 

This theme also has zero appeal for me. Nonetheless, the gameplay is compelling enough that I'd play it again if given the chance.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome heavy strategy game. Not overly complex, with tons of choices that are not simply a tweak of familiar mechanics. The staff tree, with the ability to re-org every turn, is awesome. Very cut-throat as well, with the ability to completely lock out someone in a round depending on the cards played. You can leverage specific advertising to set demand and override competitors, pricing to cut out competitors, and the race for the powerful bonuses is awesome. 

Only knock is really the graphic design on the map tiles: totally seem like they are prototype components, especially for a game with the high price tag. Made of flimsy cardboard too, and the paper money is no better than Monopoly money. The menu rule pamphlets and the design on the cards though are great.

Can't wait to play again: can easily see this going to a 9 or higher.

Edit 08/13/16:  played three times now. Awesome, awesome game and bumped to a 9.  I think the only thing that will prevent this going higher is it is SOOO cut-throat. Discount 1 extra dollar over your rival? You can steal every sale and have a $200 swing no problem. At times the commensurate reward / punishment can outweigh the difference in strategic performance.

Edit 08/20/16: Another game. Still great, but what's taken this down a slight notch now is the 'sandbox' part of the game is actually a huge misleader. There are specific paths you have to take at the start or you are right out of the game. Still extremely fun.

Splotter does deck building..sort of...

Based on 1 play. Learning Game. Huge learning curve! Brutal game conditions. Shades of Indonesia. Splotter's best title since Indonesia.

SO SO SO highly thematic. All the rules are so intuitive because the game is so thematic.

Downside: one or two players will know they are going to lose and there's nothing they can do about it. This can definitely have a runaway leader, so the losers have to spectate for a few hours. 

Drop from 8 to 7. Second Play. One player got eliminated. And the prices just kept dropping. A dominant player can control selling everything for a very low price. We quit because after 3 hours, it would have taken another 3 hours for people to be selling burgers at $3 then $2 then $1.

Early days, but this game may well be, or at least up there with the best non-wargame I have ever played. Blends all the elements seamlessly together. Components are great, balancing visual appeal, functionality and theme together. Highly interactive, thematic, fun, fresh, dynamic, rich deep decision making and excellently designed and tested. We only have touched the surface but one of those rare games that you will probably enjoy even more the more you play it. In stark contrast to those overhyped, flashy games that after a couple of playings you realise there was actually not much of a game there. Update: A genius in games design and innovation. Can't think of a better designed game I have ever played. I understand some people may not like the harshness and runaway leader/blowouts but thats a feature not a criticism when you put full control in the hands of the players. Game is perfectly balanced and every move has a counter and is swingy enough that you can still make comebacks. Like "Food Chess".

It's official, Splotter has laid an egg.

As I saw this title become Splotter's deepest foray into the mainstream of the hobby, I became suspicious.  Indeed, of the four of their titles I have played, this is clearly the weakest.  Not a bad game, per se, but it features substantial downtime/fiddliness (particularly during endgame) and runaway leader syndrome.

The genius of Splotter has been the subtlety with which they introduce player interaction.  The typical euro player - possessing all the social skills of Frankenstein - struggles to deal with that interaction.  He feels such an urge to react to anyone who frustrates his carefully prepared path to victory that, rather than shift to an alternative path, he seeks vengeance.

As a result, the multi-player solitaire titles multiply.  Who can build the most efficient engine to rack up VPs?

Splotter's other titles have overcome this with increased fluidity of play, i.e. paths to victory that are less clear and more easily masked.  FCM, however, is anything but fluid.  Innumerable posts on BGG attest to importance of the first hire (if not the first restaurant placement).

Given the lack of fluidity, the player attaining the early lead can be stopped only by coordinated action.  

I'll play it again, but only to appease my game group.

I thought it was much better with four players than with three players. 3 is still very fun but with only one radio advertising one item is going to be overwhelmingly important and the bank likely to break the turn after the radio is played. This will give the person who chooses what to sell with the radio a huge advantage. I suspect the two player game would suffer from that as well. I'd love to try five players as this game is great fun!

Have played it several times now and what a brilliant, unforgiving game Food Chain Magnate is. I love it. It's absolutely brutal, punishing you for making mistakes early to the point you can be completely out of the game halfway in. The strategy is in avoiding this, and while you're going to definitely have some terrible experiences because of this, there are some great ones to be had if you stick with it.

It's an objectively excellent game that is unfortunately not really my style: too long, a little too abstract, and way too punishing. The economy of the game is fascinating, and the fact that it's all pure information makes me intrigued to play it more to explore different strategies. Unfortunately, the length and depth of the game are hindrances to getting it to the table, because neither I nor my husband want to potentially sit around for 3+ hours watching someone else wipe the floor with us.

This game is excellent. Be warned, you may transform a gaming buddy into an enemy!

There are so many different strategies that you can follow, and they are all dependent on what your opponents are trying to do. If you plan ahead, you can really screw up your opponents plans. This game can be infuriating, in a good way.

I'll have to play it a few more times, but it seems like after the bank breaks the first time, that the game really starts to snowball in favor of those in the lead, and that there's not too much people who are behind can do except to pick someone else to grief for the remainder of the game. 

My only real complaint is that there is no in-box storage for all the pieces, no trays or bags. And after adding myown Ziploc baggies for all the pieces, the box doesn't close. For a game this expensive (I paid over $100 on Amazon, because it's out of print), I would expect better storage.

That said, the game is totally worth it, and is a new favorite in my group.

The first Splotter I learnt. Online at that. The online implementation at boardgamecore is really good. Can see how it might take really long in person and with AP-prone players but it's just such a smart design that I can't wait to get a copy and try it face-to-face.

First live play was good fun. One player played it for the first time, the other player who owned this copy had played once before. I won because I went the guru radio strategy and they didn't counter it well enough, or rather, they had some infighting which benefited me.

Looking forward to more live plays. with two new/newish players, a 3p play only took 2.5 hours so it was quite alright.

Interesting heavy Euro with a surprisingly well integrated theme !
I found the action selection system not very interactive and the opponents decks building difficult to follow.
I did not understand the order of play choice mechanic (we all always played the latest to be able see what others do before playing), and the pace of the game was very strange to me : very slow at the beginning and very fast ending with an unexpected end.
Good experience overall.

I really enjoyed the deck-building aspect of hiring and training employees to fit into a corporate structure, and I'm a sucker for economic games, so I enjoyed that as well. There is also a TON of player interaction in this one: competing on prices to lure customers, launching marketing campaigns to influence demand, etc. It's a great aspect of the game, as you're always responding to what the other players are doing, and trying to carve out business for yourself.

My only main gripe is that Splotter is always pretty bad at physical component choices that make the games way harder to play than they need to be; the players not only have to learn a challenging game, but they also have to overcome unnecessarily poor component/usability choices. I'm not talking about art quality here, as that's totally subjective, but rather decisions that affect a player's ability to be able to be able to easily find and interpret important game information.

In this case, the milestone cards are so important to be able to see and read, but they provided no way for players to easily do this, even though it's easily solvable, and solvable in a way that makes the entire deck of milestone cards unnecessary, saving on table space. Speaking of which, the game takes a ton of table space, which was also partially solvable in a way that also solves the milestone card problem (I've posted an image showing this solution).

Most Splotter games I've played have this sort of issue, where the games are great, but they don't think about usability, taking away from the game experience. I like some of their games so much that I fix them with homemade modifications (I also made numerous graphical changes to my copy of Antiquity that makes it easier/faster to play by just those component mods), but most people won't want to jump through those hoops. It's a shame since this is all easily avoidable if they'd take input from someone with an eye for usability. Their playtesting shouldn't just be about game play, but also ease of play from a component perspective.

Anyways, I'm ready to play more of it to explore the game, as it's a lot to take in on the first play, as expected!

Wow. The number of options available is just on the edge of complexity for me, but the theme makes it so easy to understand and digest how to play. It is very intuitive. The menu player aid is inspired and easy to follow.  

The milestones force players to either react to other hires to not fall behind on a certain path, or specialize in something the other players are not doing. It is definitely true that not getting your share of quality milestones early on is going to be tough to recover from (or from the initial placement). I think this needs to be explained to new players, but I just don't see that as much of a problem. 

I also love the tension between a short and long game, and the type of organization that benefits. I love the interplay between the organizational tech tree and the cutthroat competition on the board. 

It is a savage battle to market stuff that people can't yet produce, to work to undercut them on price, or build a new restaurant right in their territory, or new houses near your own. There are so many options to pursue, and it is all in reaction to what everyone else is doing. 

And I just love the theme and feel of it. Great game.

Almost as much fun as being a MacDonald's management trainee. 

I'm not a fan of efficiency engine games or of this incredibly dull topic. This game really divided opinion in my game group. Some players absolutely loved it whilst I felt it was totally devoid of fun and not something I will play again, hence the 2. The menus are well produced and the other components are okay. I found the road layout difficult to interpret and that's not a good thing when your first task is to place a restaurant in the optimum location for proximity to houses, etc. The milestone cards are vital if you want to do well. It seems that if you don't get off to a good start you'll have difficulty catching up and that's not great in what can be quite a long game.

Players are continuously adapting strategies to the current trends of the market. The game is so cruel and takes quite a bit of experience to be competitive. It is definitely unique and great, it plays great with the right crowd and 3-4 players.

:tobacco: :( :) :D :D :D Sometimes it takes someone standing outside the echo chamber to really grasp something that whooshed over your head. In my case, it was my wife, who listened to me describe Food Chain Magnate for the better part of a minute before saying "Oh, you mean 'Food Chain' like a chain restaurant, not like carnivores eating herbivores!"

I don't know if the double entendre was intentional but it's remarkably apropos; Food Chain Magnate is a rough and tumble survival of the fittest game, at times fully capable of making Dominant Species (which rather more explicity embraces that theme) look like the got-damned Ungame.

It's not wrong to point to the various progenitors of this game: 18xx's purely deterministic nature, closed economy and finite bank, Indonesia's vertiginous feeling of solid engines upended in a single stroke, a dash of pick-up-and-deliver (minor twist: the customers come to you), a bit of deckbuilding (without the hand-to-hand randomness), and a wonderful "restructuring" mechanic that functions both as simultaneous action selection AND tableau building all at once. Other stuff I'm probably forgetting off hand. Le Age of the Race For The Indonesian Galaxy's Dominion and Robber Barons.

In many cases, a game with this many ideas clanging around in it would end up being a hot mess, or at least the dreaded Less Than The Sum Of Its Parts. Not so here. The surprising and delighting thing about FCM (given its popularity among the economic-game crowd -- gotta be honest, we're nerds even by nerd standards) is that it is -- kind of accessible? Not that intimidating to learn? Attractive and fun? Even kind of silly?

I'm as surprised as you.

Now none of this to say that it's easy to pick it up and start playing well. Screw that noise. You have a starting decision to make in turn one. You can easily screw it up and spend the next two to three hours with the game metaphorically sitting on your chest saying "STOP HITTING YOURSELF! STOP HITTING YOURSELF!" And just because you managed to not blunder on turn one, don't assume that turns two and three are going to be a church sangin' with the supper on the grounds. And by the time the various players' various plans begin to truly come into contact with each other, that sweet little engine you built off in the corner, hoping no one would notice? Yeah, someone notices. And your engine shifts directly from fifth to second gear with all of the ease and subtlety you'd expect from an engine shifting directly from fifth to second gear, and you're forced into a desperate scrabble to adapt your entire business model while simultaneously, you know, making money selling hamburgers, which two goals can prove to be durned tricky to pull off in the same turn.

First Impression:
Wow.  I tried my hardest to approach this title with a clear head, but couldn't help but be charmed by the lovely graphics and clever design.  Given their track record, I'm content to error on the side of optimism in an initial rating.  There is so much to like here.  I'm a little worried about the Milestones--that is, they seem unnecessary in an otherwise clean design.  Surely staffing locks players into their strategic paths with enough of a hold to make tactical pivots difficult.  But, again, given that it's a Splotter, I'm inclined to trust the added chrome.  In a very strong year, this could be my favorite title so far. 

Also: I suspect that this title will also reach a lot of new players-especially considering the nice artwork and fun theme.  But, make no mistake, this game is a bloodbath. My favorite move of hte night was aggressively using marketers to invade my opponents base with products he couldn't give them.  It locked up his profits for turns while he was forced to lay off a third of his staff until he could build another restaurant.  

Update: 
My fears about synergistic milestones were overstated.  They work just fine and give the first few turns some nice strategic consequences that extend beyond the tactical snipes of most other business game.  That said, they aren't prescriptive either.  Tactical flexibility is just another organizational asset that can be developed or ignored.  

Update:
A couple plays later the game's connection with TGZ is becoming much sharper. They are very similar games, though after different things. Ultimately, I think the cool things about TGZ resolve into a rather neat auction game. FCM isn't like that. It's a drafting game where the desired object is only gradually manifested through the play of others. I often felt like I was building a car while not knowing exactly what course it would have to run. The Milestones provide some nice strategic pressure, and, of course, in my own car building I was determining the course as well. The balance between overarching strategy and tactical maneuver is fabulous (especially because tactical pivoting can be drafted as well). Couple that drafting game with a killer spatial element, and I think Splotter may have its best game yet.

[Apologies for the redundancy of these remarks, I'm just hosing impressions for a possible future review]

RATING: 9
Excellent and rather unique forward planning game with a solid theme. There are several clever bits that fit together: the milestones that create the strategic asymmetry but also a strong incentive to follow the other players,  the discount + distance demand capture competition, and the limited snowballing effect, since money today and money later is the same and your engine development is around command slots and recruitment and training speed. 

I found the game a joy to play, and a bit of a brain burner. One needs to be mindful, that you might lost the game in the first 15' and then have to endure 2-3 further enjoyable but non-competitive hours. That's the Splotter philosophy, so I'm ok with that.

Overall, super effort and a strong place in the permanent collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
FCM is a game that almost feels like it is played in two halves. The first portion of the game is all about angling for the special game length Milestone cards that will craft your strategy, and putting your corporate hierarchy structure into place. The second portion involves actually getting things done on the board by stimulating consumer demands, collecting / producing the items needed to satiate those demands, and out-angling your opposition.

As is standard for Splotter, there is a fair bit of heavy lifting in the logistics portion of the game, but this really isn't as heavy on that as many of their titles. The biggest aspects seems to be the ever nasty positional play (last early is good to follow the leader and not miss Milestones; first is good later for selling stuff, most of the time at least) and the difficulty involved in balancing production, with demand stimulation, and maximizing price.

For a game with so many interlocking mechanics, FCM feels like it is cut from whole cloth. The theme, though ridiculous in some ways, fits the game to a T and makes it easier to understand what is going on. Marketers make people want stuff, the food producers and drivers pick up that food, your staff can help set prices: lowering them in competition heavy markets, or raising them dramatically if a monopoly exists. The intricacy is in the timing, and what starts out simple ends up being considerably more complex by the end as turns get longer and the decision trees get broader. You can play a lean company that just sells a few things to the right people at the right price, or you can play for a longer game with a huge structure and massive production capabilities. There are zero random factors involved in the game itself after the initial set-up and turn order draw.

Length-wise, this seems better with less, I wouldn't want to play with more than 4, as the "each player takes their turn" system means that each player adds about an equal amount of time to the game. You really want at least a few people at the table to really get the competition flowing properly, but too many and it bogs down, especially if the corporate structures get too big.

Also, as is usual for Splotter, but perhaps even moreso here than usual, a mistake early can really put you down in this title. Every turn involves planning / making moves that will affect the next one, and because of the extreme power of the Milestone effects getting behind very far early will put you out of the game in a hurry. For games of this sort, I think of this as a benefit, but many people don't like games that lack any sort of catch-up, so be aware.

I quite like it though, and it has the benefit of being pretty fast playing once you get into it. Repeat play seems like it could get a 3 player game down to 2-2.5 hrs. tops, which is great for a game of this heft.

Aside: the Milestones really are the heart of what makes this game fun. Unless you are graduating to this from something like Ticket to Ride, just play the full game from the start; otherwise you'll be missing out on too much of the game.

It's very good, it's not $250 good.  This game is the most monstrous game to set up and explain but once you get going it's very enjoyable.  There are so many elements and strategies to work with and no real aggressive competition to end friendships.  It's complicated but simple at the same time and that's the beauty of it.

A very deep economic game once you get into it. This has definitely got a number of optimal opening sequences that will not be apparent to new players. Can stagnate in the mid game and become a very drawn out battle of attrition.

A cutthroat game of outbidding and outpricing your opponents. No catch-up mechanism, but that's to be expected from Splotter. The milestones are an interesting addition, even if they seem so very powerful. Going wide and tall both seem viable paths, and the evolution of the game is entirely dependent on the players' actions. Last, but not least, the cynicism permeating this game is brilliant: no wages for entry-level employers, people don't want anything unless it's advertised to them, and waitresses break ties. Excellent.

Very good game, but I feel bad when teaching people the game and often say "We'll play until you look at your hand and say 'Oops.' Then we can restart the game." Rewards experience with the game, which I appreciate, and contains a lot of depth for the simple set of possible actions. (The difficulty in teaching is what knocks it off of a 10 for me.)

I can see why people like this game, but it didn't strike me as the second coming of gaming, which is what some of the early reports have sounded like. First off, I don't like tech trees in games, but I know some people do, so that's just me. The core system works, and there are definitely some interesting things there, but I really really don't like the milestone system, which is core to the game (or at least I expect fans of the game to claim so). Rather than having goals with rewards for having achieved something that took a lot of effort, like in many games, there are many rewards for completing things that are rather easy, but give permanent bonuses. I really disliked this. There's a quick gold rush for the cards in the first few turns, and if you screw that up, it's game over, 4 hours later. It's quite plausible that if I played without the milestones cards for my first game (as recommended in the rules, in fact), I would have enjoyed it more. I would also probably have preferred playing with fewer players, and playing only the first half of the game. Then layering in both the complexity, length, and more players. But I suspect that I would never like the milestones cards, particularly because it requires you to pay attention to all of the specific exceptions to the rules that each player has (if you want to actually know what players can do and not play multiplayer solitaire), and it's a lot to try to keep track of. Never mind trying to keep track of what cards each player has. No one expects to keep track of all player cards in a game like Dominion, but in a zero-randomness 4 hour game, those who can and do keep track of such things are at a distinct advantage. Those who can't or dislike the effort of doing so are at a disadvantage. I personally prefer  games where I can easily observe all game state, both common state and player state.

RATING: 10
Amazing game. This is the first Splotter title I've played, and it is fantastic. Initially I thought this might be an 8 or 9, but after 7 plays and discovering just how many completely different strategies were viable approaches to victory, this game easily jumped to a 10.

That said, the game is certainly as brutal and unforgiving as reviews generally indicate. I've had more than one loss whose cause I can trace directly to a single mistake on my part. In some games this would be frustrating, but for some reason in Food Chain Magnate I find even these losses satisfying. I could see that my strategy had the potential for success had I but executed it better.

There is also immense satisfaction in correctly predicting an opponent's move one turn ahead of time and then hard countering it.

I'll be keeping my eyes open for other Splotter games to try out, because if Food Chain Magnate is any indication, their designs live up to all the praise.

Take an ounce of splotter, throw in some great market demand mechanics, add a hint of deckbuilding, but avoid that husk that leaves that a terrible aftertaste (random draw and big money strategies), add programmed actions, but without the major penalty clauses, top it off with a "tech tree"/employment hierarchy to die for. More or less a perfect game for me. I need to try it with salaries to be certain of that.

RATING: 3
I base my opinion of this game on two plays. The first play I won by being in a corner of the map where no one else could sell anything. I already noticed during this play that the game is extremely cutthroat competitive and I would probably struggle if I had to go to a pricing war with my fellow players. The next play was exactly so. The whole map was one single road network, two of the players had -5$/-6$ to their prices. I tried to find tactics to counter this but nothing worked. Everyone produced 6-12 of each food and drink item per turn. I just sat there selling nothing for like 10+ rounds at which point I was so fed up with all of it that I quit the game even though it wasn't finished yet. First time ever in my twenty years of playing boardgames.

I can see how this game can appeal to those players that like games where all the information is visible and nothing is left to chance. I, on the other hand, utterly loathed this game.

Rules, components and artwork are ok, no complaints there.

A great but ruthless game. There is sheer fun in being a maniac food chain owning capitalist overlord. The game suffers a little from mental management of what is due to come off where. I was a little turned off by the simplistic 20's style design at first but it grows in you.
Would recommend putting more money in the bank for your first few games just so you can see more of the corporate ladder and other mechanics that can only appear later. I feel token quality could be better and certain rules need a little clearer explaination. Would recommend this to boardgames and a few people who have a bit of game mechanic knowledge under their belt.

Notes:

Food Chain Magnate gives you everything you need at the start of the game. It is up to you how you use them. Elegant, but simple rules. BUT don't let that fool you, it is a ruthless, cutthroat game that will leave you bleeding, even more than a men on a map style game. You have to pay attention to what your fellow players are doing during their turns. You need to pay close attention and see how you can manipulate their turns to your advantage - generally by following their actions or player order. There is not candy and unicorns in business. Bottom line is, "You will buy my lemonade, you will like it, even if you don't want it!" The only downside for me is that the theme does not appeal to me, and the components, they are drab - this is mainly related to the game board tiles, they feel like a prototype. Visually dull.

RATING: 8
The game's choices are somewhat overwhelming on a first play, and I suspect one's first few games will be dedicated mostly to coming to grips with basic strategy paths, discovering what's efficient and what's not.

After that, it looks like it'll shine, with all sorts of opportunity for reaction, interaction, screwage, and brilliance. Others' comments about it being possible to lose the game in the first few turns seem eminently plausible, but unlike Chicago Express, I don't *think* that'll bug me here. For me, much of the satisfaction  was in having plans come together or in successfully throwing a wrench into someone else's plan, either of which ought to be possible while battling for 3rd place rather than 1st.

I doubt I'll ever own a copy: it really wants an experienced group (or at least one that's past the "overwhelming options" stage), and I don't think it'd hit the table often enough to create one.

I think FCM is quite possibly a 10, but I'm reserving judgement until after a few more plays.

This is not a game for players having disparate degrees of experience with the game.  Give newcomers a game or two of sandbox play, before pitting them against others in serious play.

One of the beauties of this game (and there are several) is how one can look at all of the employee types, resource types, and milestones, and completely overlook how that mundane-looking little board can drive the game as much as anything else (if not more).  After just one or two plays, the board looks completely different to you than it did before, as the ramifications sink in.

A thoroughly engrossing game.

I'm not good at this game. I get the theory, but when it comes down to it, I'm just not good enough at anticipating what people will be doing next turn, and this is particularly bad in the early game when people are milestone hunting. So why have I rated it a 10? Because I really, really want to play it again and again, even though I'm awful at it. Seeing a strategy executed perfectly, and then crushed at the last minute by someone who anticipated it - that's pure gaming excellence.

This wasn't as heavy as I expected.  The rules are very simple, but you REALLY have to know what you're doing or else you can totally ruin your game.  So maybe it's best to describe this as "unforgiving?"

Still, when you do know what you're doing, this leads to an incredibly tense war game.  There's lots of back and forth, surprise attacks ("You're advertising for pizza?!?") and empire building.  I've really enjoyed our handful of plays, so this is sticking around as the Splotter game in my collection.

Perhaps few other games depict so well the reality of an enterprise company as Food Chain: 
The struggle for the best prices and for the establishment of the nearest shop to consumers, the importance of the advertisement, the know-how, the investments in bussiness management vs basic workers and, in the end...the need to lay-off!...
Some cons are relationated with a bit difficulty in understanding the "philosophy" of the game and also with the calculations of distances between different shops and consumers, it could be easer. Also, (although modular) the board could be more appealing and the game could be cheaper...

I love engine building games, and this game definitely scratches that itch for me. But what I also love is that you have to watch what employees your opponents are hiring and make appropriate moves to counter them early, because it can be difficult to recover from mistakes as it takes 2 turns to react (and it might be too late by them). Can be very cut-throat (which I would normally hate), but I somehow don't mind it as much in this game.

I was interested in this game because of the pseudo-deck building mechanic of hiring employees but Food Chain Magnate not only does that beautifully but does a whole lot more as well.  This game has endless numbers of possible strategies, and all of these strategies can be completely ruined by the tactical maneuvering of your opponents.  This game definitely requires you not to just play your own little game, but be extremely cognizant of what your opponents are doing and how you can best drive their corporations into insolvency.

I think it's best with four players, it still plays great with two, but it's a bit less nuanced when you only need to compete for milestones with one other person.

[24 Feb 2017] - 9.5 (5 plays)
I love this game. Right amount of player interaction, a good amount of decisions to explore and just enough rules to make decisions in the game meaningful. There are a number of tactics out of the gate that can be taken with hiring employees and enough variation in the maps to give you different things to explore. The game also moves quickly and doesn't take a huge amount of time to play once you get the rules down. The art style is a perfect throwback to the 1950s diners and does it very well. The wooden pieces are way better than colored cubes in most other euros. Can't wait to play this game more.

[14 Sep 2017] - 9 (10 plays)
I still enjoy the game but it's brutal. The last game I played I made some rookie mistakes in the first two rounds and I knew that I lost by the time we flipped the reserve cards. Towards the end of the game I was picking up steam but there was no way to undo my mistakes in time. Obtaining milestones a round before others and matching their milestones is critically important. You can't get a good engine going without those abilities. You also need to know before the game what you want to pursue so you pick the right reserve amount. The rating drop here was for the game being too brutal to introduce to casual players. It seems mean to teach them, beat up on them and then never have them play the game again. Works well for players who want to make repeated plays to explore the game to it's fullest.

[27 Nov 2017] - 9 (12 plays)
Finished up this on my 10x10 challenge for 2017 and keeping the rating at a 9. This last game I tried to win with just Waitresses and was pulling in $50 a dinnertime but the reserve was too big and gave my wife time to get the big money selling food. It really is a game that will let you know well before the final count that you messed up and lost. Sometimes that makes it a tough sell and probably what keeps it from being a pure 10 for me.

Moving up the rankings for me as one of those games that hit a lot of sweetspots and does so really well, especially with the interaction and theme coming in strong. And while it might seem minor, I really like how everyone sets their structure at the same time and then has to play through it on that turn. This cuts down on the AP, but still allows for some in-game flexibility on how you carry out those actions, eg. who do I train and hire, or what and where do I advertise.

[July 2016 - 9.0]
It's quickly becoming one of my favorite games, but does have some drawbacks.

First, the positives...the strategy and replayability in the game seem pretty endless. Right off the bat it's about how the board gets laid out to determine what strategies might do better than others, especially in advertising.

I love how it combines deckbuilding, area control and engine building with no luck involved. It's like Dominion, but you chose your hand to play each time from your entire deck.And while that may seem powerful, it really takes some time to get your engine going. The area control on the board can shift turn-to-turn and it's really dependent on the advertising -- that's the turf battle. Sometimes, it might seem like a solitaire game, but it really is highly interactive.

The negatives... I love the theme and design on the cards, but the art on the board tiles is lackluster and I think the tiles themselves should have been larger in size.

The game is also pretty harsh if you make one or two mistakes, which can put you out of the game pretty fast, which isn't much fun for a longer game.For that reason, players should be all around same level.

The dinnertime counting up of the distance, discounts and other modifiers can be a little fiddly, but once you get the hang of it, it gets easier.

All in all a great game and fun to experiment with.

As we were packing up the game after our first play it hit me...

It's Indonesia! They fixed Indonesia! 

Ha! I didn't even know it was the same designers! The theme is totally different but I had this strange sense of familiarity throughout until it hit me. There were always things I loved about Indonesia but it felt flawed, and not just by its overwhelming length and the almost unusable components. FCM is the total conceptual reboot it desperately needed.

And what a great game it turned out to be. I absolutely love it. 3p took about 2.5 hours, amazing feeling of ramping up throughout. It's like they took a normal tech tree and pulled out 2/3 of the cards. Every step up is huge but it all feels balanced. 

Just brilliant!

How can I give this game a 9?  I'm not sure, but for some strange reason I liked this game.  I had no idea what I was doing.  I hate how there are so many cards you need to know at the beginning of the game.  Marketing, production, and delivery (on the board) was opaque to me.  It's got serious screwage.  This is the type of game I should hate, but I ended up liking it.  Probably a day later, I started thinking about this game some and realized where my understanding of it was struggling.  I think it is clicking more now for me.  Looking forward to reading the rules before my next play.

Few small rules errors on first play, this is an eight after a few plays, but may go up with additional plays. 

Heavy, but not that complex. Brutal and very unforgiving of new players. If it's your first play, I'd recommend rotating the board tiles so there aren't too many cull de sacs; and ask whoever who has played before to guide you through placing your restaurant, as if you get this very wrong there's a good chance you will lose the game. And also don't gloss over the milestones in the rules explanation as you'll want to scoop a bunch of these as quickly as possible. 

There is a high price point on this game for what you get, though the components are nice -  in fact I pretty sure you could break the components into two halves if you meant to only ever play with two/three and give them to a friend if people do that) as there is a super abundance of cards. The milestone cards should have been smaller cards, or cardboard tiles to save on table space. I probably wouldn't want to ever play with five - four plays long enough, three is probably the sweet spot.

I love the art, the map tiles are spartan, the box is nice and compact - which will be a bit of a squeeze to put the cards back in if you decide to sleeve them.

Also the variable play time based on reserve cards can be bypassed by doubling up the starting money (at 50/75 per person) at the beginning and playing until the bank is broken once, that will fix your play time at something around the 2 hour mark dependent on player count. As I don't really like the idea of sitting down to a game that may take 2 hours, may take 4, especially on a school night. 

This is a provisional 8, though I have the feeling that this is a game of Powergrid/ Brass like quality with a theme (and I am actually from the Northwest of England so get extra giggle mileage from Brass) that's more accessible, simpler than brass, equivalent in complexity to Powergrid but less math homework like, more intuitive and (in my opinion) fun. Though I'll check the fun factor rating on replays. Also it plays excellently with two, which is a massive plus.

Regarding table space, with a print out of the milestone cards on the back of the menus (later editions only) you can stack the cards and rummage for them; same with the employees, you can stack them by colour rather than type and you have shrunk the space needed with only a little additional fiddle.

Addendum: Few recent plays have confirmed my initial rating, Its great, though I don't know if I can take it's rating higher as with new people this game can grossly alienate, making a second play unlikely. Basically it's simple but opaque and things tend to escalate quickly, leaving you feeling a little bit dumb. You can fail at numerous things often at the same time. Though I don't care, it's still my favourite economic game and after several plays the surface is still unscratched.

Not nearly as heavy as I was expecting. Mechanics are all very straightforward, but the decisions are where the weight really comes from. One wrong plan and your restaurant becomes a ghost town, nothing left but echos of a time immemorial when customers once bought your lemonade. Although it's tough to get what you want done, making your employment tree every round is quite entertaining.

This game is too good. I personally like the graphic design. I think that a board cluttered with art would do more harm than good due to the calculations made in the game.

Tickles my gaming balls with a feather plucked from the blessed dove itself. It is fantastically strategic, deep, complex but accessible at the same time. Every turn has you scratching your chin. Players will coo in admiration of each other's masterful plays and laugh at the tug of war opera that grips attention relentlessly from start to finish. I find this game to be utterly brilliant but it doesn't get a 10 because it can be so brutal. It's not a fault of the game itself but someones's fun can be soured quickly and irreparably from a bad sequence of moves. FCM is punishing and good players will always beat newcomers. But that is the game.

FCM is undoubtedly an amazing game. When you play it, it is breathtaking as to how much you have to think about at any one time. 

You are building an organisational business structure and a bunch of businesses and advertising campaigns on the board - the type of employee you employ determines the actions which are available to you. As usual in a good Euro, you want to do all of the actions and hence employ all of the types of employee, yet you can’t. Decisions decisions. Delicious decisions. 

And this decision space is huge. It demands a long-term strategy accompanied by short-term tactical timing decisions. Yes, it is all about timing. Miss that optimal timing and you may get cast adrift. 

And so this game ticks so many boxes that you can come to a conclusion that it could possibly be the perfect game.

So what’s not to love? I do like this game and I respect it enormously. It is the cleverest and deepest game I have possible ever played. It has a perfect balance of strategy and tactics, with no random elements at all. Yet at the moment it is a feeling of awesome respect rather than genuine love. I can’t yet love the game, like I love many other Euros. Why?

1.	The game is brutal. Fall behind when trying a strategy which doesn’t quite fly, or you slightly miss the precise timing of a round in the game, and you are out of contention. For a game which lasts many hours this could be soul-destroying.

2.	The decisions are fairly overwhelming at times and for someone like myself, without the super-intellect to work out the implications of the options, it can feel frustrating.

3.	The game models the complex business environment so successfully that sometimes I feel like I am at work. Working in the Marketing field as I do further promotes this.

4.	It is fundamentally an economic business game. These games often feel a little emotionally cold to me, even when the gameplay is as good as it is here.

5.	It is a long game. 45 minutes per player is optimistic. There is a lot to do on your turn and the downtime could be considerable, although there is always much to think about as the others take their turns.


If I compare it to other Essen 15 releases then I enjoy playing Mombasa and Ponzi Scheme more, the former for its simpler decision space, and the latter for its simpler interactive economic mechanic.

I am looking forward to more games of this masterpiece and will enjoy exploring it over the coming months. Will I ever grow to love it? Time will tell.

Epic and it is complex, but I don't think too difficult to follow once a few turns pass. It's heavy strategy though, and a few wrong moves can drastically set your plan back, as can other players messing with your intentions. Fun though and I'm excited to play more.

Great diner restaurants simulation placed in the 40's. It's a heavy euro economic board game with fantastic decision making mechanisms: choosing right employees, investing in marketing, tracking demand, fighting the competition etc.
The only drawback is lack of seamless catch up mechanic since runaway leaders are almost impossible to catch, and awful UX design choices. For that price I would expect much much more.

Food Chain Magnate is a very involved Euro simulation.  I've played twice now.  It was pretty fun with four players, albeit a bit long.  It was terrible with five (too long and unforgiving if you fall behind).  I suspect three players is the sweet spot on this one.  For a game of more reasonable length, I'd suggest dividing the sum of the initial reserve cards by half vs just taking the sum, especially for four+ player games.

It's one of those games that's very punishing if you make a mistake and fall behind and for a game that's 3-6 hours long, that's just not acceptable to me.  Extreme rich get richer mechanics.  Very few ways to regain lost ground once people can snatch up any order from any house across the entire map due to multiple locations or discounts.  I might play this again, but not any time soon.

I was a doubter: about the price, about the art, about the gameplay. Consider me convinced.

I enjoyed this.  There seemed like a variety of strategies that could work.

Milestones are a must, you need to get a couple to have a fighting chance, otherwise the other players have a leg up on various actions.

The employee tree was interesting, although it seemed kind of pointless since there wasn't any difference in placing people at different levels.  It makes it easier than just having a set number of employee slots since that gets messy for the black card that add slots, but also take up a slot.

I still don't understand the whole engine and what exactly is a better move than the one I'm doing, but this is still a good game.

I really like how the differents elements are integrated and bring a solid package. It is a sandbox where the balance is in players hands. You will have to adapt your organization to the changing board but there is a certain inertia : recrutment, training and marketing will only be effective in the future.

Lot of choice, lot of direct interaction (marketing is such a powerful weapon) for an unforgiving game.

Terrific game.

Wow Splotter, way to make an incredible and cutthroat game.  This game is pure capitalism in a box.  Businesses compete and the losers are brutally beaten down in the fight for the customers' money.

The milestones are all worth fighting for, the hiring/training menu is genius, and the graphic design (while stark) is perfectly functional and non-distracting from the brain-burner that is this game.

RATING: 8
No doubt a brilliant game and perhaps a masterpiece. But when it comes to "fun", I have only given it 8/10.
I love deep strategy games but the reason I only give this 8 is because... the paths to achieve what you are trying to achieve are so obtuse that it introduces confusion at the rules/mechanics level, such that you're not just timing things to beat your enemies, you're timing things to beat the game.
The best part of the game is hustling for position with the other players, but unfortunately you need to ensure that you get the game mechanics right too. I wish I could have the hustling without the obtuse rules, although I appreciate that it is the obtuse gameflow which make the hustling possible!
It really is brilliant, but perhaps not everybody's cup of tea. I'll happily play it and it is incredibly unique.

Sein Name trifft den harten Kern des Spiels: FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE ist in jeder Hinsicht ein anspruchsvolles Restaurant kapitalistischer Planwirtschaft. Ein sehr erwachsenes Spiel. Zum einen, weil es ein ökonomisches Profitstreben und Marktdenken einfordert, das keine Fehler verzeiht und einen knallharten, aggressiven und reaktiven Wettbewerb forciert. Konsumkampf. Zum anderen, weil FCM jedes kindlich-magische Element vermissen lässt. Hier zählt das schonungslose Business. Der Aufbau der eigenen Personalstruktur zum Abverkauf von Fast Food ist Deckbau Premium, der dem organisierten, mathematischen Verstand desto mehr entgegenkommt, je länger die Spielzeit durch eine prall gefüllte Bank bestimmt wird. Auf einen Schlag lässt sich zum Schluss der ganze Fast Food Markt exploitationmässig abschöpfen und in einem erbarmungslosen Streich eine Partie gewinnen. Vorteil Vollprofi im bedingungslosen Kapitalismus. Der Style changiert zwischen genialem 50er Jahre Wirtschaftswunder-Look und der funktionalen Nüchternheit eines Knochens, was im Mix das Spielgefühl gut widerspiegelt. FCM ist von erschreckender Autorenprofessionalität und einer thematischen wie strukturellen Brillanz, die keine Wünsche offen lässt. Splotter bleibt seinem gehobenen Ruf gnadenlos treu. FCM kann so brutal sein, dass einem der Mund offen stehen bleibt, der mit einem kalten Cheeseburger gestopft wird. A McDonalds Boardgame Experience.

Food Chain Magnate is my choice for the best heavy game of 2015. I think that if I had more opportunities to play Food Chain Magnate at home then it would have placed higher on this list. That said, the game is interesting in that although its quite deep the gameplay is simple and clear. These kinds of games are interesting because you can think that you know what you're doing even if you don't. (I don't)

Fascinating  & complex economic euro about running a food chain franchise.   Game is played by doing the following each turn  -  setting up an organization,  hiring new workers, producing product, planning new marketing campaigns,  building new housing development, opening new restaurants, selling product and then paying salaries and lastly creating demand for product the next turn.  

It definitely captures the feel of trying to out-think what your opponents are going to do next that is the reality of running a business. The fact that you create demand for product to be fulfilled the following turn as well as waiting a round to play the new workers you just hired requires careful planning and reading of your opponents plans.  Very punishing of mistakes.

I was excited to try FCM, as it is the first Splotter game I've played. Will it live up to the hype and the luxury cost? Some pluses: It has a nice theme, great wooden components, and overall is solidly designed. It's the solid design of a heavy economic game such as this which I think gets people who like this style of game so excited. For me, the game was very boring. The first few rounds really grated on me as I discovered how to play optimally.  A few blundered moves at the start really made me feel like I was set back for the rest of the game (fortunately, this wasn't the case so much in this session).  Eventually I grasped the basics of placement and then figured out the marketing and selling mechanics (which can be quite obtuse at first but work okay once you've got the rhythm down pat). But the whole tech-tree of employment was overbearing and the card-play lumbered along. The game felt like it crawled at points.  When players got nasty with each other it felt more annoying than  deliciously frustrating. The constant mathy-ness of figuring out whose restaurants attracted which houses was a plodding experience. And when you get down to it, I found the game just plain ugly. To summarize, I don't think this game is broken at all- it works extremely well for many people. My rating is based on personal enjoyment and also how messy and clumsy the game feels at points. For me, Food Chain Magnate overshoots my definition of "fun".

Punishing by design. During our first play, one person was definitely having fun (he won by $500+), one person was frustratedly trying to catch the fun-haver, one person was bored and crushed, and one person made a mistake on the 2nd turn that had him on the sidelines for the whole time. This might be ok for a game that takes 45 minutes. This one took 4+ hours. 

All of the constituent parts of the game are interesting, I loved the theme, and I do think it's a well designed game. But what it adds up to is a brutal, unforgiving experience where it's hard to imagine a session when all of the players at the table have a good time.

This was disappointing. There's no creativity allowed in the player actions. To be competitive you have to play copycat - taking whatever action others do to try to steal their milestones.

The art is strategically ugly - thematic and brave to make a game look like this but pretty blah aesthetically. Overrated.

Each turn can be exhausting--you have to pay attention to everyone else, or you will get crushed. Lots of logistics to keep track of, even down to the order of houses and marketers. The game also takes up plenty of table space, even with an organizer for all of the cards. That said, it's a magnificent game, oozing with theme and brain-melting strategy. It's ruthless and highly interactive, and feelings will get hurt if you don't like anyone to interfere with what you want to do. Our first learning game took something like 5 to 6 hours (4 players), and when it was over we were all exhausted, but we all said we'd love to play this game again, soon. Went home and couldn't stop thinking about different strategies to use next time. Made me see my other games in a new light--mostly, that I didn't want to play many of them anymore.

Just a fantastic game, and want to play it as many times as possible.

Couple introductory plays. Wow. This game has me as excited about a new game as I've been in some time. The strategic depth looks amazing. Really looking forward to exploring it.

Update: after a couple additional plays, still enjoying the game a lot. The tactical and more impressively, strategic depth are quite impressive. Many layers, and everything can be countered. You're fighting for advantages that usually don't last long, but if you're good at anticipating opponents, can put you ahead for some time.

The core engine is cutthroat and interesting (purely endogenous demand) but relatively simple.  So good impressions there.

I'm on the fence about the milestones system.  It's not my favorite mechanic to have targets that provide special powers you have to artificially plan upon.

What a great game! Totally cut-throat, build a fast food empire and bully your way to success. The mechanics are reasonably easy to learn but learning the cards and rhythm of the game well enough to be able to plan ahead is a bit mind-boggling. Takes 3 hours to play. Bought in May 2016.

First Impression (3.21.17)
I had a knee-jerk distaste for the theme and art in FCM. But it being a Splotter and at the top of so many people's list, I decided to acquiesce to Chris's desire to play it.

General Thoughts: 
-Overall, I'm not sold on as taken with it as so many are but I will try it again.
-The component quality is really good, much better than I expected. I kind of came around to the art but I still find the theme really off-putting. 
-The rule set isn't terribly complicated but I need to read the rules to better understand some things about distance, marketing, and a few other edge cases. 
The player interaction is really mean, which is great, but it can also see it making for games where a couple good turns midway or later in the game could put someone so far ahead that it forces you to just call it.

Out-standing Negatives:
-Adding the reserve money for the "2nd" round at the beginning of the game seems really off to me in that it's supposed to have strategic value but, as everyone starts off the same, it really doesn't. I'd prefer to just say at the beginning this will be a short, medium, or long game, or figure out some other way to add reserve money.
-Downtime during the 9-5 phase gets exponentially longer. The game really starts to drag. 
-Although the planning and decisions are difficult, I don't find their is much in the way of tense moments. It's like, "Oh, you stole that soda and pizza from me. Okay." I guess there's a bit of it in the poker-style bluffing of "what am I going to play this turn" but the way people reveal their employees for the round doesn't let players experience tense moments. 
-Starting with no money and the ability to hire just one person makes the game a very slow burn. This added to the feeling that there weren't really tense moments. 
-The training tree, with the majority of cards only being able to be trained via Managers gets old and further inhibits the speed of the game.

Opinion: ok, I am a fan of Splotter, said that this game is as good as Antiquity, Zimbabwe or Indonesia for me, a top. A very well integrated theme and, although the long explanation, everything runs really smooth and with sense. You manage your enterprise as you like.
There are many things going n in the game, select which milestones you will go for, select the workers you need and use for the round (taking into account the spaces you have), position yourself in the map, produce and create demand...
You finish the game with really good sensations

The card play is delightful. I don't like how constricted the early game feels, but after that it really opens up.

I spend lots of time trying to think about which plays my opponents will make. Correctly predicting their recruits, trainings, and corporate structure are key to doing well in FCM. I find this exhausting. It requires lots of concentration to keep track of all of your opponents and predict when they will do a new advertising campaign or undercut the prices on their burgers. Because of this, FCM feels a bit more like work than many other games.

It is heavy. It is very tight and strategic. It is very unforgiving. I understand why so many people love it. The game just isn't for me.

Excellent game without luck and very high replayability.
I love games in which I don't know what's gonna happen from one game to the next and Food Chain Magnate is one of them.  Other games have high replayability because of how the cards come out or another random element.  This one amaze me because the only thing random is the initial setup of the board.
I love how you recruit and train employee in this game.  There is so many possibilities!  I want all the employee but I can't have them all!
I also love that the players need to make marketing otherwise there is no demand.  You can really mess other player's plan by marketing something they don't produce!
The 18 milestones for being the first to do certain things that gives a one time bonus or a special power for the rest of the game also change the strategy and help make each game different.
The only negative about the game is that there seems to have a runaway leader problem.  In most of the games I've played, the winner had at least 200$ more than the second place.  Because there is no luck, a player that make an early mistake will have no chance to win and will have a tough time for the next 2 hour.
I love the game nonetheless and want to play again after each game!

Interesting mechanics, original theme, simple and clear rules, deep strategy. What's not to like? Well for one I really don't dig this game, the theme just doesn't grab me and I find it difficult to play properly.

FCM is one of the most interesting games to come out in years however its complexity, playtime and ruthlessness will not appeal to some gamers.  It is a worthy addition to the Splotter canon.

Unfortunately, though I think this game is utterly ingenious, I can't get it to the table for a number of reasons.  1) it takes up a LOT of room.  2) It is very fiddly, and my playgroup had a hard time dealing with it and got a very negative reception.  Still, I personally look forward to playing it more if it is possible.

This is one of the more elegantly designed games that I've ever played. It's also one of the most strategic; I suspect if I played this with anyone else I would get trounced. This may not have the broadest appeal, but the integration of the theme with the mechanics, and the challenges of the decisions were fantastic. I didn't mind the art at all, as it gave me that 1950s fast food feel.

It is as unforgiving as advertised, with a lot of front-loaded decisions that can haunt you forever; fortunately, though, the game is not as long as advertised if players play reasonably briskly.
This is a delightful economy game, with lots of ways to manipulate both the supply and demand. Add your personnel management to the mix, and you've got a lot going on--which helps alleviate the time concerns further. This is by far the best Splotter game I've played.

How to do training alone got us stuck for 30 mins trying to figure out what the instructions meant - tookwatching several but finally found one youtube that explained how and im not sure we would have ever figured it out otherwise - such a simple thing.

Fine game with a real nice card mechanic and a refreshing and cool them. However, all the counting in the "Dinnertime" phase breaks it down by a good amount. It takes too long and is a bit too fiddly.

As bland as the board and tokens look, the overall graphics and layout is just great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Unbelievable game. Brutal... merciless about mistakes, but so much fun. Very interesting decisions and lots of player interaction. Absolutely worth the price. 

It will take a couple plays for new players to conceptualize how to handle their first few turns to get an engine going and how to counter different player moves. However, I wouldn't say the game is "heavy" in the sense of requiring knowledge of a ton of finicky rules, and the amount of game knowledge about strategy a player needs is much less than something like say Twilight Struggle. I taught this to my family who have been confused by games like Pandemic Legacy (I'm pretty sure I've had to explain how the Researcher works about 20 times at this point), and they were pretty up-to-speed after one play. Generally simple and intuitive rules.

Milestones are HUGE in this game, do not sleep on those. They grant huge benefits, especially in early game where missing out on the right milestones can really hurt your plans for a while. The importance of milestones and the significance of management trainees as the gatekeepers before all of the most powerful staff are the two biggest things I recommend teaching.

Depending on how you read it, the lack of women in management positions could be considered satire of 1950s culture or actual misogyny. My group chose to read it as the former, but this may be a sticking point for some.

Who will like it:
Strategy fans who like rich games filled with interesting decisions. Players who like player interaction and don't feel personally slighted by other player decisions that can ruin their own plans. People who like to strategize about contingencies, line up a turn that accomplishes several goals, or sabotage their opponents. People who think engaging in a burger arms race after a radio advertising campaign is hilarious. People who are willing to shell out more than average for a board game.

Who should skip it:
People who can't deal with having their plans dashed. Table flippers. People who don't like to be attentive to the turns of other players. People who aren't looking to pay about double what the average board game costs. People who aren't looking to play about a 3 hour game (though interestingly my games were closer to 2 hours after the initial game, so take some of the longer estimates with a grain of salt. Time spent thinking about a turn definitely dominates amount of time resolving a turn here).

Food Chain Magnate is pretty darn cool: it's a competitive fast food economy in the era of booming fast food. It's quirky, it's vicious, and surprisingly pretty straight forward for a game of its weight.

As the newest Splotter on the block, this game offers more of what they boutique publisher is known for heavier Euro fare with a focus on economics, logistics, timing, and positional play -- all of which pulled together by a sensible theme. FCM does not buck this trend but rather pivots on it a bit. It's closest relative, the Great Zimbabwe, has a closed economy, but not here! Money is earned, money is spent in ways that are open (who knows where that money goes, its the American dream/nightmare!) -- in turn, you are *almost* wholly responsible for your revenue... if it weren't for everyone around you undercutting your costs, advertising products you can't deliver on, or even hiring key staff before you can! The small-ish map means that every game has players coming into inevitable competitive and collusive relationships: this is where the fun occurs! Throw in a bit of typical Splotter turn-order shenanigans and it is tense. As an economic game, it provides milestones (i.e., powers) as an incentive to not treat the structure strictly as a snowball: this encourages many different approaches (e.g., early food spoiling means you get a freezer for keeping up to 10 food items between turns - great if demand surpasses supply!).

While this isn't the most mechanically accessible Splotter, the congruence between theme and mechanics create a real sense of narrative that many players may already be familiar with. Splotter definitely has a hit on their hands with this one.

Played one introductory game and one full game. Both 3 players. From reading the rules it was clear that this was an extremely elegant game in terms of its design.

The mechanics are very thematic and are very easy to grasp. Creating your corporate structure each turn is so elegant and engaging that it just does it for me. 

The artwork is phenomenal. Some people are complaining about the design of the board but I think it's completely adecuate. Also, best player aid ever!!

Grasping the rules is easy although mastering them is quite hard. Very unforgiving if you do some mistakes but when it works its that much more rewarding.

Overall a great experience. Only downfalls I see is that it's a game that you can only play with people that have played before unless you are learning it at the same time. Also for your first plays read some strategy guides if you don't want to completely screw yourself in the first turns.

I like the card mechanism. I hated how much time it took to set up the game, how much space the layout of many, many different stacks of cards needed. I did not like the ganeboard with the counting of fields to calculate from which restaurant a customer buys.

Really can't give it a full and fair appraisal after one game (5-player at that) but my general thoughts are it's an interesting idea with a generally unenjoyable gameplay experience. It doesn't help that I don't particularly enjoy most eurogames.

It also feels overhyped as "sandbox-y", particularly when everyone then acknowledges "you can make a bad move early on and then you are screwed for the game". Which is probably down to the milestone mechanic that I strongly dislike.

But, like I said, I've only played it once and maybe things will be more competitive and interesting next time. Yes, I'm willing to try it again.

RATING: 9.6
I love how the rules are relatively  simple to grasp but the play can be very complex/deep. The initial board setup is random, but the cards available for purchase is the same. Your strategy very much will depend on what other people decide to do. If you play in your own corner of the board and are oblivious of other people's actions/plans, they could very well muscle in to your area and steal your customers.

The rules recommend the first game to be without salaries, milestones, and breaking bank only once. An intro game seems to be about 8-10 rounds, which is 60-90 minutes. I've started mentioning this when teaching because the end comes much sooner than people expect. Players tend to spend a lot of time hiring people to hire people to hire/train/train/etc, and by the time they are ready to start selling things, the game is over.

I've finally gotten to play the full game and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Can't get enough. I find myself jotting down notes on what I project I will do current turn (because I don't want to forget when it comes to my turn) and for planning what I might do or try to do in future rounds. These notes constantly are shifting based on what other players do.

An economic game about building a supply chain from scratch and then creating demand for the product. There's the potential for a very good game here, with just one problem: this game is massively punitive of disparate player skill. You may think that's the game you want, but there's at least the potential for a severe runaway leader problem and with no catch up mechanism you can easily find yourself chugging along in last place while opportunities multiply for the leaders. Early moves are just crucial, get it wrong and you may as well not play the rest of the game (shame there's no way to liquidate your company). This is a very tough game to rate, it's a heavy thinker and with players of equal skill this could be a classic, but for most groups I'm afraid it's simply broken.

This is really reminiscent of the Great Zimbabwe, in that there are sources in particular parts of the board and transporting the goods is the main thing. FCM, however, relies much more heavily on your ability to predict how things are going to shake out based on spatial map rules.  I can't do that at all, which is a little frustrating and befuddling.  Additionally, it's really hard to change your strategy in the middle of the game. Still, this is an interesting system and I like the cards. (1 play)

Rather pricey for what's in the box, both in terms of quality and quantity, but  makes up for it by being a finely crafted game.

Comments:
I have a few concerns about it. For one, the opening hires seem to be pretty heavily scripted, with quite a few options seeming to be bad or at best highly conditional. Second, new players are going to get DEMOLISHED unless they are either incredibly talented, or read a lot beforehand. It takes a session or two to really grok the game, and it makes no secret of the fact that new players are playing badly. They will lose, it will not be fun, and it will be a slow death.

All that being said, the game is wonderfully intense. From start to finish you need to be watching and reacting to everyone else. If you don't keep an eye on your vulnerabilities, they will be exploited mercilessly. If you can find a table of players that enjoy that sort of a dynamic, this is a great fit. Fatigue has been a real issue in my games so far, as one mistake can end things for you. It gets tiring to be constantly trying to telescope the game out multiple turns in the future to figure out what you need to build toward.

Fun is the wrong word, but it's close. The best way I can phrase it is that this game is fulfilling. If you win, YOU won. If you lost, YOU lost. That sort of direct control over your fate is both exhilarating and terrifying.

Rating it a 7 for now, but I could see it rising with more play.

That being said - there is a "barrier to entry" issue with the game.  Not knowing the right way to start off is super-punishing.  We had to play a trial first several turns, scrap the game, then start over.

I can see where having several people who know the game play a full one (or several) would be terrific.  However, this kind of game is not for everyone.  Not good for a group of players with mixed skill levels, not good for casual gamers, very thinky.  And the theme may not appeal to everyone - it's cute and somewhat original, but not inspiring.

Best Euro I've ever played (sorry Terra Mystica).

This game is the antithesis of 'multiplayer solitaire' and I love it. Extremely interactive. Perfect information. Multiple strategies.

For how incredibly mentally-demanding this game is, the rules are fairly light! Probably most brilliant is how this game all but negates "optimal strategies" given its huge emphasis on player interaction (and reaction!) with its modular setup.

Artwork is wonderful. Minimal, perhaps, but the graphic design is brilliantly cheeky ("100% Dice Free!"). The player aids shaped as diner menus was the kicker.

Not the explosion of tiny square pieces like Indonesia / Antiquity / Roads & Boats. Plenty of wooden food tokens and SO MANY CARDS. The table-space needed for the cards is one of the most unreasonably large I've seen. At least the rest of the game is fairly tidy!

Unreasonable card space aside; the game is a lot less "fiddly" than, well, probably any Splotter I've played. Maybe Greed Inc. was more ergonomic but there's so much more in Food Chain Magnate. A problem with Splotter games in general is the amount players tend to fiddle with pieces is more than average; FCM seems to be very minimal in this aspect (except for laying out the humongous card space).

Every mechanic in this game is ingenious. Reading the rules for the first time, every part of the game seemed to do something clever for the game. For example, while this is a game that ends when the bank runs of money (player with most wins), the bank has to run out *twice* because of secret "reserve" cards. At the start of the game each player is given a set of these cards, each has a different amount of money. After picking starting positions on the main board, each player secretly chooses one of their reserve cards to be a portion of the money that fills the second bank (that is, the total amount of money on players' chosen cards is the second bank). The full amount is kept hidden until the first bank empties; obfuscating the game length but still giving each player a portion of control to that length.

The game is built on twists of normally mundane mechanics, and FCM is so much better for it. The action economy is a twist on deck-building ("there's no deck, but instead..."). There are permanent-yet-limited-in-quantity benefits players can grab that is a twist on achievements. Competing in selling goods isn't just "lowest price sells" (the twist is that your consumers will by more expensive food and drink if its closer than the other chain...assuming you have all the food and drink they want!)

While longer than Great Zimbabwe, this one is quickly becoming my favorite game among Splotter's designs (otoher ones played being Roads & Boats &cetera, Antiquity, Indonesia, Greed Inc., Indonesia). Considering Zimbabwe and other titles by the designer are some of my favorite games of all time; this is high, high praise.

This is the Eurogamers version of a kickstarter minis hype game. But instead of paying buckets of dollars for loads of plastic, you play buckets of dollars for a very poor looking game because it's a "hipster boutique" board game. 

Long, prone to runaway leaders, and not a lot of fun. This game seems to get by on hipster cred more than value for money.

Incredible game, one of my favorites, the thing captivating me is that you can do Everything! I mean: you choose your own path to glory (or bankrupt) here, I see plenty of interaction, building new restaurants and adjusting prices could be very mean to others, in fact I've always seen at least one player going really bad in each of my plays so far, but then it was never me, so I see it like a natural selection, the best business man win at the end. And there is a hell lot of choices to do here, who to recruit when to do it, when to fire people. To win here you have to be really efficient, and meanwhile you cannot "kill" another player you can slow down the their economy and this is really good from a game. In some others I miss this part, I like Terra Mystica, but I lack that direct conflict you can have here. I mean if someone is selling a lot but at a high price and winning, you can outbid him selling cheaper but blocking him for 2-3 turns at least! Love FCM

This is one of the best games I have played in the past decade. It's an exception for me, in that the length and rules complexity* are so worth it. I love how theme-y the game is; it makes the rules seem intuitive. I also love the art and graphic design, and this game has one of the best player aids I've ever seen. 

*The rules complexity is really not that bad, but it's there. There are a lot of steps in a turn, and the game is overwhelming to new players because of all the cards. 

Half the game is an efficiency thing where you're "building an engine" to make more stuff than your opponents. That's fine, and rather brain burn-y, and you'll be best off if you can anticipate what your opponents will be doing. But the heart of the game is in the other half -- the advertising --  which leads to wonderfully intense interaction. It feels like freakin' warfare. But with burgers and pizza.

This game has teeth. First-timers will likely lose by a lot to experienced players. An early mistake can take you out of the running. I don't consider these bad things, you just need to be ready for an intense game.

Sensacional juego de Splotter Spellen. 

Se trata de gestionar una cadena de restaurantes a varios niveles:

El primero en cuanto a la estructura de empleados que tiene tu compañía. Una treintena más o menos de empleados diferentes que puedes ir mejorando, algunos cobran dinero a final de turno y hay algunos únicos durante la partida.

Por otro lado sobre el tablero que representa la ciudad estarán los restaurantes y las casas de la gente que viene a tu restaurante a comer, lo que hayas conseguido publicitar en turnos anteriores, de modo que son los jugadores los que establecen la demanda. Y claro, para darles de comer tienes que haber producido esa comida con tus empleados.

Finalmente, existen una serie de hitos que son para el jugador o los jugadores que durante un turno sean los primeros en conseguirlo, genial vuelta de tuerca que provoca que la planificación de a por qué hito vas sea importantísima

Juego buenísimo en el que el tema está muy bien ligado con las mecánicas y fluye extraordinariamente bien. Si quieres ponerle una pega, como te descuelgues tienes muy difícil engancharte a la partida.

RATING: 6
I was stricken by the originality and charmed for the 1st hour of my play.  Almost a 'wow' effect.
But later on I grew tired of performing the same activities (produce/do marketing/sell) over and over again.  Yeah, you do them in different variations and combinations.  Competing with other players, ruining their plans (and vice versa) at the same time.  Hiring very different personnel who can guide you in specific directions, in the process.  STILL, I didn't feel enough variation in my turns.  They felt 'samey'.

I guess I'm just not excited by the optimization as well as the tactical competition to satisfy households' needs both of which the game provides.  The most interesting and promising part is building your company roster by hiring people with very different skills and thus forming the strategy your company will adopt but this is only a part of the game...

Pros: quick playing time (2-3h), simple rules (as for a Splotter game), the dynamics, minimal downtime.  A zillion of cards with milestones and people to hire is a superficial deterrent. 15 min. into the game and all becomes totally managable.

I might be tempted to try the game in the future but I won't be suggesting it.

A hand management game at its core with a devious area control mechanism on the board. FCM punishes poor play and rewards taking advantage of opponent's mistakes. There is no catch up mechanism and runaway leaders will occur even between equally skilled players.

But never before have I seen a tighter design. Every element blends well together, every action feels important. There is no wasted space or "fat", it is an exceptional experience hampered only by its difficulty curve and massive quantity of flimsy components.

I loved the way you collected and managed employees with the cards, and the milestones were really cool, since you can generally make sure you get the ones you really want if you're careful but it involves watching everything your opponents do. You have to be even more careful about the board stuff. It seemed like you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get sales going and it's easy for an opponent to jump in and undercut you, which definitely fits the theme. It's also very hard to react to if you don't see it coming ahead of time; it usually takes multiple turns of no income to get back into a position where you can make money. So I can see that being really frustrating for some people, but also a big plus for others. I'm sort of on the fence about it. Generally I like a little less aggressive amounts of interaction, but here I found myself really enjoying the potentials for jumping in to someone else's market and watching for others trying to do the same to you. Definitely one I'd love to play more to see how different games can evolve and try new strategies.

Update: It's losing a bit of its luster for me. I'm really not a fan of the scripted openings, and just in general I feel like there's nothing too unique about it other than the multiple turn delay between when you choose to make an adjustment and when that comes into effect. But I feel like if I want a tight economic game of jockeying, there are a number of better options (Arkwright, the better 18xx). Also, there are some really involved procedural parts that if you want to be playing your best you'd probably spend a lot of time counting out, but that would make the game drag a lot. Still good, but there are enough blemishes for it to be out of the top tier for me.

This game is truly fantastic!  I've loved many of Splotter's past games but they hardly get to the table. This game does yet played and thank goodness due to the cost. Unfortunately, The production is typical Splotter, not very good and the graphic design is just not good. I won't even bring up (as I'm doing anyway) the $125 cost of what is essentially a card game. Still...this may be my new favorite game, top 5 most likely, top 10 for sure. I don't regret paying the price I did but I wish this was more easily available at a lower price point.

A deep game with simple rules, love the theme and the mechanics. 

It can be a little cuthroat in that you can take hard fought customers away from other players by undercutting them on price and/or opening/moving a store nearer to the demand to the point where a player could end up selling lots of goods one round, to selling nothing the next.

It all fits perfectly within the theme, but I am not usually a fan of cuthroat mechanics, so I don't know how I'll feel about the game in a few plays time.

RATING: 8
This is a fun very very deep game with great theme.  Each player is running a fast food business in a small town.  You have to make the food, stoke up household appetites with ad campaigns, and then compete to feed them with the closest and cheapest food.  Every round you choose which employees to deploy and a lot of the strategy involves which new employee types you recruit each turn and which you choose to put into play.  There is a lot of outguessing your competitors which makes for high drama.  An especially interesting twist is the milestones wherein the first players to perform a certain action (friendly ties) get a permanent reward that is often quite powerful, reinforcing the multiple paths to victory aspect of the game and powering often intense races for certain milestones.  This is a Splotter game, which is a Dutch garage outfit that is infamous for well-designed games with poor components.  In this case the components are good quality and reinforce the 50's theme quite well.

Food Chain Magnate is one of the heaviest games I've ever played. It has some drawbacks - players can take commanding leads or become all but removed from the chance of winning well before the game is over, the art quality is all over the place, and the amount of "following procedure" to resolve rounds can drag the game - but there is definitely a deep gameplay experience in this box with clever engine-building in the form of the org chart, multiple paths to victory (thanks particularly to the milestones that drive players to pursue certain paths), and plenty of challenging and interactive tactics to consider throughout the game. It may actually be a bit too much for me, but I can't wait to get more plays in to learn to appreciate the game more than I already do.

This game is like tetris, in that the more you play, your mind starts calculating it in the background. I've dreamt about this game - no joke. As your experience grows, your tactics will as well. It's not just about one strategy that you play solo. You may have a strategy, but you'll need to adjust it as the game goes on to react to the actions taken by your opponents. Love it. Top 10 for me.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2016)

Splotter games are always unique, even the ones I don’t like have had fresh and innovative ideas so I’m always open and excited to try more of their games. Food Chain Magnate has very good reviews and I’m happy to report I really enjoyed the game.

The game is very expensive as is usual from them, but I don’t mind much about that. For once, if I like the game then I REALLY liked it so it is well spent money, and If I don’t like it I can sell the game and recoup the money I spent in the first place.

The theme isn’t exciting for me, but it works very well with the game mechanisms, still this is a very minor issue to me.

The game components are ok (which is bad for such an expensive game), but, if you compare them with previous Splotter games, they are really good. They are improving and that’s great. The art is ok and it serves its purpose. In any case the components and art are always secondary to gameplay for me. It has great player aids. The graphic design works very well.

The setup can be a bit annoying and it requires a big table to play.

The rules aren’t complex, but there are many rules. You can explain the game under 20 minutes. Playtime is around 3 or 4 hours, still as the game is so immersive I don’t care much. I think it´s best played as a 3 player game, with more players the downtime begins to be annoying.

Food Chain Magnate offers a plethora of good and interesting choices (Which worker to recruit?, Which worker to upgrade?, When to upgrade?, Which workers should work this phase? Which product should I buy/generate?, Which advertising campaign should I play and where? Who is delivering the same products as me?, Which milestone should I grab?). You also need to analyze when the game will finish or it can upset your plans (I lost this way, I needed one more turn to win but had I realized the game was about to finish I think I could have won as well :D) and that’s great! Zero luck factor, a huge plus for me in an strategy game. To me, Food Chain Magnate has a medium-heavy weight game.

The game can be mean in the sense that your plans can be for naught and all your food can be lost, I love it :D. This can happen very easily if you don’t watch your opponents moves, so the game is highly interactive, you are always fighting for the limited demand. As is usual from Splotter, one mistake can take you out of the game (this is a positive for me).

The replayability factor of the game is high due to its modular board. It is a bit reminiscent of another great Splotter game, Indonesia.

Bottom line, Food Chain Magnate is a winner in my book and a keeper for me. I really want to play it again soon and I’m pretty sure my SO will love it as well. It can perhaps get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. It is a satisfying Euro game with very interesting decisions and no luck, just my kind of game. 

Current Rating: 7.5

Phew. This game is daunting. From the almost blank box to the dry rulebook, Food Chain Magnate is an exercise in board game teaching and learning discipline. But the visual design, game design and delicious, delicious strategy all come together in what is now my favourite heavy game. Abuse your friend's expensive radio marketing to sell your cheap cheap chain pizzas, or make a mom-and-pop Lemonade stand run by volunteers. Create demand for things your opponents can't produce, and run a beer and burgers Mafia in your own corner of a tiny town. One of the best things about this game is the stories that it creates by virtue of its fantastic mechanics, and that is what will keep me coming back again and again. Like a deep-dish pizza all to yourself, FCM is oh-so-heavy but oh-so-delicious and truly satisfying.

Fun theme, strategic gameplay.  My one knock after not that many plays is that it seems like a player's first couple moves are really important and making a bad first move can sink an entire game.  Games sometimes end early due to a mercy rule where one player is clearly going to win.

The card play is awesome, but I feel like the way the board works is a bit fiddly.  Definitely more of a gamer's game.

Fantastic game. The only criticisms I would make is:
1. It is not super accessible to new players. I have played with a few people now who seem quite overwhelmed by the choices and strategies available to them; and
2. What is with there being 6 cards for some milestones and 3 for another. This is not a cheap game and you really do expect a premium product. It was a bit of a letdown in that respect.

Otherwise, fantastic game!

Oooh..where to begin.
The combination of missed rules and info overload at the beginning of the game caused major confusion and poorly played early turns.  With that, this is a pure asshole euro. Not "I'm gonna kill your troops" area control asshole as in Kemet or Cry Havoc, but pure sneaky "I'm gonna steal your shit" kinda euro similar to that of Dominant Species. Those who complain about the solitaire experience of Agricola or even Terra Mystica will adore the interaction Food Chain Magnate offers. 
There are several worker paths which can provide fun exploration of the game. Turn 1 storage seems a necessity, but from others' comments, it's merely a crutch for noobs. I can appreciate that.
There is no catch-up mechanic, so early mistakes simply mean you lost. That's a significant difference between FCM and Dominant Species.
We'll see if this has enough legs to warrant enough plays for the group to completely 'get it'. I doubt it will, but we'll see. If I get more plays in, I suspect this game may reach an 8 or 9. But after my one play, I believe there are plenty of other tried and true great games that deserve my attention. Back to the first sentence, this may be a case that the first play semi-spoiled my experience.
Wooh! After a second playing, I am done! I appreciate why others enjoy the interaction and constant changing game state this title offers. There's most likely a solid title here for those who enjoy their euro with heavy 'asshole' player interaction, but I prefer that mechanism in my area control games, not Euros.

Dense mechanics, but in an extremely satisfying and (mostly) elegant way.  Engaging, complex choices balancing corporate structure, marketing and food service mechanics, made more thrilling by tough inter-player competition.  The reward of setting your structure /just right/ to steal customers from your neighbor - I can't remember a gaming moment so satisfying.

Only downsides are 1) excessive setup time and tabletop needs; 2) lots of mechanics and their interplay to master (not a downside to me, but to some); 3) unforgiving to new/young players -- early bad decisions can wreck you, made worse by 4) long game times.  Last partially mitigated by player choices, but only partially.

Downsides restrict when it can make it to the table (and with whom), but the experience itself is worth it.

my main complaint about this game is the ratio of parsing the game state to the decisions is pretty high.  mid/late game it is just really difficult, but completely possible, to parse exactly what is already going to happen the current and even the next turn, but also what the players going after you are likely to do.  this parsing is insanely difficult though sometimes.  so when you screw up it feels not like the other players outplayed you but you just failed to count correctly or failed to see one single move into the future.  it's like when you make a bonehead move in chess and immediately get your queen captured.  OOPS, well we're 3 hours into the game and I just screwed everything up with that bonehead move.  Guess that's game over for me.  not exactly fun.  I guess next time I will take 10 minutes to make every single microscopic decision on my turns..

RATING: 10
Not all Splotter games are great, or even good, but they are always interesting and without exception worth trying. The best games create an open play space with a few boundaries (without a lot of rules overhead) that allow the players to invent creative strategies and form their own journey through the game. Clearly these games are not for everyone, but for those who get excited by a truly blank palette of possibiities at the games' beginning, no one does it better than Splotter.

FCM is just such a game, possibly the game with the most open game play and possibilities of any of their titles (or very close to Roads & Boats in this regard). I have not scored any of their games a "10" before now, however, because there is always a little bit of awkwardness in some of the details of a Splotter game, which I don't mind but it keeps it from getting a top grade. FCM is really a smooth and streamlined realization of what they do best. Every turn was filled with "ah HA!" moments and "holy crap" realizations of what is possible. In our first game, one player made as much money as the rest of us combined, which enabled us to talk long and excitedly about what he did well and where we went wrong. There will always be great conversations born out of games of FCM and always something new to try. My top ten of all time needs to make room for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Thoughts after 1st play (3ply session):

I was hesitant to pick up FCM for quite sometime do to what I saw as an over-emphasis on engine/deck-building, combo-creating card play, and the overall number of cards. I tend not to like a game with a million upfront options and lots of actions to choose from but rather prefer a small menu with a limited set of actions to hone. 

I found my first play of FCM to largely be what I initially feared. An emphasis on engine/deck building with tons of options, a growing number of action possibilities, and more semi-direct player interaction on the board. I see how everything still comes down to undermining your opponents on the board; however, the time spent on building and ramping oneself up toward board shenanigans is a little long for my l taste. Rating 7.

Thoughts after 2nd play (4ply session):

Wow that was easier and faster (we didn't play the reserves though just $400 for 4 players). I focused largely on board development and built my structure in response to how I wanted to utilize the board. I did mimic some milestones of one opponent whose restaurant was close to mine, but otherwise I focused on maximizing the board. My path was a combo of discount manager and business developer with some minor cooking/advertising. I won $260-60-50-30. Rating 8.

Thoughts after 3rd play (2ply session):

Played through the first bank with my wife tonight (just $200). It was her first time and she ended up with more employees, 15-11, and more milestones 8-7, than I but I used the business developer to build two houses, add a garden, and coupled it with a radio campaign and burger cook to sail to an easy and quick victory. My wife commented that she was actually understanding it by the end. However, when asking her about playing it again she ops for other Splotter's. Rating 7.

Thoughts after 5th play:

Well I think this is settling at a 7 for me. I admire it more than like it. I just don't enjoy building my corporate structure, the time it takes to upgrade from one thing to the next. I have the same issue with Antiquity; it takes multiple turns to implement something. I like it once it gets going but the first half of the game is just boring to me.

General Thoughts:

I think FCM, like many a Splotter is a brilliant design. This is the most interesting and interactive engine-builder I've ever played. I can see why this is so immensely popular. It combines a fresh take on a popular mechanism, deck/engine-building, with an intuitive theme, fast-food business, with goals to be achieved (milestones), and board play that has potential for nasty play.

That said I definitely prefer other Splotter's, particularly TGZ. In FCM here seems a shift in emphasis toward more longterm engine building and planning vs the more instant reactionary play and direct player interaction and interdependence of TGZ.  While there are still board shenanigans to be had, they are easier to plan for (most things are a turn away) and nobody can directly impair your engine vs TGZ where things occur that same turn and people can render your craftsman obsolete.

RATING: 6
Tenative rating based on around a dozen plays thus far, half of them on-line at the excellent implementation at boardgamecore.net.  Very heavy economic game with a big learning curve that is very unforgiving.  Zero luck factor once the random board is set up.  Enjoying the challenge of this one despite getting my butt kicked a few times, right now I would say it's quite possible the rating could go up with a few more plays.  The main aspect of the game I like best is the recruiting/training mechanism which works smoothly and is very intuitive.  The one negative aspect is that it can be an all or nothing game, meaning you can go from winning to zero or even negative sales if you get in a situation where another player can outproduce or undercut you, and right now that's an aspect of the game I am somewhat uncomfortable with.

EDIT;  Dropping the rating down from 8 to 6.  This game has fallen totally out of my play rotation, mainly because of the one unrealistic negative aspect:  if one company is doing a little bit better at generating sales, they tend to win 90-100% of the business, not 55-60% as would be the case in real life.  Think it might be better as a computer game.  Also, a pain to set up with all the different cards,

A bit on the dry side for some and I need to play another 20 times before i say it has a scripted beginning, but the refrigerator, marketing, hiring, and training miles stones seem very powerful if you can get all of them.  Certain openings seem doomed for the long game, and others seem necessary for the long.  The problem is in my two player games I went for the drink strategy, followed by the radio strategy followed by ceo and i just overwhellmed the other player.

Have to play it with a physical copy, but my impressions i collected while playing the online version of it are, that this game is absolutely awesome. So much is going on. So many decisions have to be made. No 10/10? - Yes. It's really a great game, but the lack of luck is, mostly for new player, deadly, because every mistake made during the first rounds may hurt you the whole following game. So, if one player started better at the beginning, it's most likely for him to win.

RATING: 6
I love a lot of things about this game, but I also dislike several things. The action selection is excellent as are the multiple paths you can take in the game. You have to carefully watch your opponents and try to benefit from their actions. Maneuvering around their actions is challenging and brain-melting fun.

However, the game is extremely fragile. Seemingly slight missteps can have catastrophic effects. A small miscalculation can take you out of the game. Player elimination is not in the game, but it essentially is. It is not uncommon for a player to be completely without hope of winning by the mid-game.

I have other concerns about the balance (especially the first to $100 milestone). But I hope that with more plays some of those will prove to be unfounded.

Ok, I have to hand in my membership card to geekdom. The new Splotter is not for me. I fail to adore the special skill combo building, I'm even annoyed by the heavy snowball effect. I was reminded of Outpost, one of my worst gaming experiences. I have no desire at all to figure out the best starting moves, to fine-tune a long-term strategy, to read the board, to find killer moves.

The milestones offend me most. For a comparison, in [gameid=171623] every player is handed one really strong skill. In Food Chain Magnate the first player to reach a certain milestone gets awarded such a strong skill. Unless all players know what they do and which milestones are most important, it is entirely possible and probable that after the first three or four turns the game is already decided by the distribution of the special skills with a single player claiming most or all essential skills. Many players will love this. I'm turned off by the requirement to learn this. 

The seemingly open nature of the game initially is not as open as it makes believe. Classic Euro engine building is a must: recruit, train (or vice versa), followed quickly by marketing. The sandbox starts only after the initial moves when the key milestones are distributed. At that point, Food Chain Magnate already lost me. The interesting part which should follow with equally skilled players will be lost on me.

RATING: 6
Note: The game is complex and sophisticated. I am personally not there yet to enjoy such a complex game, but I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys playing these kinds of games. The game is well-made and fun but has lots to consider and plan. It is definitely a great game (but just not for me, sadly).

RATING: 9.5
Adjusted score upward after 20 plays. It'd be a perfect 10 if the first 5 rounds of the game weren't so scripted. However, there's a very solid system that this game was built on. I've attempted to bend and break that system but it still holds up. The game runs fairly long (if we could remove the first 3 turns that would likely help), but the game provides the resources that prevents the game from going into a stalemate.

Card drafting like Dominion, coupled with elements of area control and economic management, with a very nasty take-that element.

Pros: Fairly simple gameplay mechanisms but with deep important decisions.  Highly interactive.

Cons: Very unforgiving to early miscues.  This is especially signifigant since this is a longer game.  Its presentation takes the 50s theme too far and comes across very bland.

Conclusion: More tactical than strategic.  Needs multiple plays to be played well.

There is a really good, solid game here, but I don't get all the raving for it. It's just a bit too heavy on tech tree to me, with some of it not making logical sense, meaning you were constantly delving into your "menu" -- which was useful and laid out well. For the price point, the production quality and components did not do it for me... bland and boring. Will play again for the challenge, but it didn't delight me like Power Grid and other heavy games often do.

Muy buen juego económico. Divertido el ir contratando gente y ponerla a trabajar cada turno. Creo que tiene bastante variabilidad de una partida a otra y varias estrategias, aunque no descarto que tras jugar varias partidas acabe siendo siempre igual.
Además estos juegos donde en los dos últimos turnos se hace mucho más dinero que el resto de la partida obligan a ir con una estrategia pensada desde el principio.

Not a bad game, but not too much fun either. Reminds me a bit of Schoko & Co. Nice aesthetics and usage of theme is certainly better than BGG description lets you expect. The economic engine works very logically and the same can be said of the tech tree apart from some of the employee functions being questionable. At least CFO is questionable. Player aids are also a big positive. The gameplay is just very repetitive and one dimensional. There can certainly be several strategic approaches, but once you choose your path it is one dimensional. There may be some tactical fighting towards the end, but that's it. You probably could stop the game a long way before the end because there is a certain rich gets richer syndrome going on. I also am neither fond of the inflexibility regarding pricing your goods nor the imbalance coming of the milestones feeding the rich gets richer syndrome. This would have been a lot more enjoyable if the bank had been emptied just once.

Fascinating game. Simple ruleset, but leads to unfathomable depth. I am in love with the organigram-building mechanism, which has so much potential. The demand aspect, meaning that goods don't have value on their own, and how many strategies can come out of it is mind-blowing. The options are many, and despite its length, I feel like playing it again right after I finish a game.

Food Chaing Magnate is an amazing economic game about well... running your own fast food chain. The rules are fairly easy to grasp since they all make thematic sense. Once you have gone through the explanation, you only need to reference the player aid. So mechanically it's not difficult to play at all. But achieving milestones, the timing of when to hire which employee or the decision when, where and how to compete... those are so important that it is really tough to anticipate their impact in your first game. The tiles may look a little bland but I like their clean and functional design and just love the rest of the components. The wooden bits are cool and the artwork on the cards is spot on. Highly recommended for anyone who likes heavy Euros.

Good game that is very brutal and harsh.  It requires an investment of many plays to become familiar with it.  One thing that slightly bothers me is that there seems to be just two standard opening moves to make if you want to be competitive in the game.  Also, I'm not crazy about the fact that having people crash your party is such a big part of this game.  I'm willing to continue playing this game but given the nature of game play and the length of time a game takes, I'm indifferent about playing this again.

RATING: 7
The most interesting new game I've played this year, with a lot to recommend it - but also a few important flaws.
It feels a lot like the supply and demand game Automobile should have been. The most important innovation is letting players determine the demand themselves, which is one of those excellent ideas that only feels obvious in hindsight. This fundamental core of the game, involving managing supply and demand to try to undercut the other players, or to carve out a unique but lucrative niche for yourself, is fantastic. In particular the ability to create markets for certain specific combinations of goods is fascinating, and offers a much richer set of decisions than the "sell x, or y, or z" decisions found in similar games.
Unfortunately, instead of emphasising the fundamental interaction to fulfil demand between the players, a lot of the trappings get in the way of it. Both the milestones and the management structure serve, in different ways, to limit players' future options. This shifts decision making from questions like "Should I increase demand or production? And of what?" - which are based on interacting with other players on the shared board - to significantly less interesting questions like "What specific ordering of hires do I need to have the correct option for two turns' time?" - which are based solely on managing one's own board. In a similar way, the milestones serve to limit players' future options by making certain plays much more desirable - and so shrink the decision space for the later game.
It's difficult to see what purpose all this serves. While one can make the argument that experienced players will be fighting each other for future opportunities, why not make these opportunities clearer to begin with, so that players can get on with interacting with each other instead of with the game system?
Overall, it's a fascinating game. I keep thinking about it, and would be interested to play more given the chance. But I suspect I won't be able to get rid of the feeling that the system could have been so much more interesting in a more streamlined form.

RATING: 9
I've just played a few "tests" so far, but it looks very promising. The only complexity to the game is the depth of strategy, because it has really simple and straightforward rules. The playing-aids are close to perfect.

I've seen that some complain about the design and components. I don't agree. Maybe €80 is a hefty price, but the design fits the game and I appreciate the retro touch it gives.

The only con I can think of is the fiddly setup of all the sets of cards and the space it takes on the board. It's not really a con, but a unavoidable effect of the mechanics.

Start from a high rating of 8.5. Too high?

---

After a couple 2-player sessions all I can say is "wow". The number of possible strategies and counter strategies are numerous. I start to love the tension of dealing with all what you want to do, but the limitations added by the organisational structure of employees.

This game could very well get an even higher ranking by time. 

Up to an 9.

I didn't expect it, but everyone I've played with so far want more and soon. People get hooked. The game proved to work perfectly well with max 5 players as well. Not much downtime and constant tension.

Very cutthroat pure economic game. The game has many openings, and I expect at high level play there is enough there to differentiate and feel like you're never playing the same game twice, even if using the same combinations of cards. Game length can vary depending on player card choice at the beginning (cool mechanic) and the AI for selling food and drinks is solid, and primed for abuse by the players. Keep adapting and staying ahead of your opponents in this one. I can't see myself purchasing this, given the price tag and the components that come in the bag, but it's such a great game. This one made me really think about Power Grid. If I played this a dozen more times it could be a top 10 easily.

Based on one 3-player game.  I can see why people like this, but it's just not my kind of thing.  In order to play competently, you need to start the game knowing & understanding most of the jobs & all of the milestones; I didn't, and sort of muddled through, but don't have any interest in improving, nor in playing again.

The same night, we also played Imperial (also low/no luck, similar length).  Although I did worse in Imperial [i](hard[/i] last instead of distant second in FCM), I had a great time, and want a rematch.  Imperial gives you a very simple framework, and leaves all the complexity in playing the other players; FCM gives you a page-long sequence of play and three or four dozen stacks of cards, each with special powers, and with various synergies you need to figure out before your first move.

It has meaning, the theme is strong and the artwork (game tiles aside) works really well.

Das Spielprinzip ist recht einfach. Jeder versucht seine Fast Food Kette zur erfolgreichsten zu machen, bevor die Bank pleite geht.
Alle Spieler überlegen sich am Rundenanfang, wie sie ihre Unternehmensstruktur aufbauen (Welche Karten sie ausspielen). Manche der Karten erlauben weitere Karten zu spielen, andere erlauben Burgen oder Pizza zu machen, wiederrum andere machen Werbung für Produkte, dann gibt es noch Fahrer, die Getränke besorgen können, Servierdamen und und und. Nachdem alle Spieler ihre Karten gewählt haben, sind sie der Reihe nach dran um sie auszuführen. Produkte die man produziert, kann man nur verkaufen, wenn Kunden auch das Bedürfnis dazu haben, was wiederrum duch Werbung erschaffen wird. Dabei kann eine Werbung die ich schalte die Bedürfnisse von Anwohnern wecken, diese dann aber wiederrum zum Konkurenten gehen, weil der einfach näher oder billiger ist.
Leider kam bei uns dieser kompetative Ansatz erst kurz vor der ersten sprengung der Bank und somit nicht wirklich zum tragen. Das kurze Spiel ist daher nicht zu empfehlen.
Ich würde mich aber nochmal zu einer längeren Partie überreden lassen.
Ein Spiel das ich kaufen würde, ist es allerdings nicht, da wir bei der kurzen Variante schon 1,5h gespielt haben und wir lange Spiele einfach nicht oft auf den Tisch bringen. Ausserdem gefällt mir die Optik (Grafik kann man es nicht nennen) des Brettes nicht. Die Produktionsketten zu produzieren gefällt mir aber sehr gut.
-> Es hat mich auch stark an "Dungeon Petz" erinnert, bei dem man kleine Viecher züchtet, die Bedürfnisse haben (Käfig reinigen, spielen, Fleisch/Salat, Magie...) die befriedigt werden wollen. Allerdings ist die Mechanik deutlich anders (Worker Placement).

Presently my favorite game.
It is a heavy strategic game with no luck element at all and you have to carefully plan several moves ahead. On the other side, the game is very interactive, even cofrontational and you must not ignore what your opponents are doing. 
The rule book is lengthy but well written and once playing, the rules make a lot of sense and are rather intuitive. The playing aid is excellent in content and artwork and you won't have to look in the rule book anymore.
One concern are the milestone cards. They are important, but there are many of them and it is difficult to keep track of when you earn one.
Artwork is refreshingly different. 
Best played with up to 4. A 5 person game can take very long.

For a game with a 4.2 game weight this was actually fairly easy to learn. Also, while presumably in the normal game you can be punished very severely for playing poorly in the beginning and your first few opening moves seems to somewhat lock you into a strategy, at least in the intro game there felt like a greater sense of direction despite the numerous card stacks compared to something like say, Agricola, where I've seen players really flounder without doing anything. My biggest issue with the game is that while there are 3 different drinks and 2 different foods, they all feel very samey and so while there are certainly different strategies you can pursue with the pseudo tech trees of training workers, the general feel of the game may feel the same each time (and as always I wish there was variable setup, as in more than just the board). However, I was quite pleased by the level of interaction: you can actually advertise for houses your opponents are serving to make their demands so exorbitant that your opponent can't meet their demands, you can snipe the customer base of opponents from them or leach off the demands they generate from advertisements, or try to monopolize a food type while selling at high prices. Also, something I didn't realize from just reading the rules is that the order of which house looks for food first can be quite significant, and you may have resources you would want to spend on a more lucrative, later house be exhausted too early. Such interactions can make turn order quite important so you can react to your opponent's actions, and can also make it hard to just plan things out by yourself. The cutthroat nature of it feels quite at home in the capitalist 1900's fast food chain theme.

I like the building up your hired staff with the pseudo tech tree of the workers. Kind of afraid there is runaway leader (while there is more upkeep for more workers, I think generally it is still better to have more), but gives an engine building feel. Also you starting with only your CEO gives you a few rounds to get a general feel of the game before things get crazy.

Obviously didn't play with the milestones, but think they would give you more reason to try different things from game to game.

I thought the artwork would bother me, but actually the card art I think fits with the style well, and the colorfulness of the wooden pieces adds some vibrance. The only think that really bothers me is how bland the board looks.

A.K.A. Ricochet Robot with an income stream.  This game was tough to rate for me as there might be a good game in here (obviously there is considering my rating is an outlier).  But I hate it.  I hate it so much.  I've played about 5 times now and hate it a little more each time, mainly because it makes absolutely no sense to me.  

If you don't mind spending a half out each turn trying to figure out where the billboards reach and what the range of your restaurant is relative to your competitors, go for it. And that's before you start thinking about your strategy for selling the burgers.  The amount of time spent thinking about how the game works compared to the amount of time spent thinking about strategy is WAY off for me.  So it's not fun.  It's just torture.

A sandbox game if I've ever seen one.  Plays very asymmetrically with different skill levels, but very rewarding in the open-ended-ness of the whole operation.  Very few economic games force direct competition as much as this one does.

One of the densest games I have ever played from a strategy standpoint.  I got trounced in my first play through, but I am intrigued for the next.  I don't know which way I am going to break on this one yet. Update: got trounced on my second play through, as well. This game really frustrates me as I can't seem to stop making operational errors. It is undeniably brilliant, however. Very high ceiling in terms of replayability and strategy building.  Update: third play through found me figuring out some things and doing better.  Definitely a super heady and impressive game.  I am a bit turned off by it visually, however.

Very solid Splotter Spellen game.  It may be their best release to date.  Components are very nice, especially the cards with the 50's theming.  The board is functional.  It is relatively easy to learn and the mechanics are streamlined.   Criticism of the art is a little silly.  It very much fits the 50's theme.  

I will say the that the game starts very slow.  It can seem that the it might never end especially with new players.  But the game does accelerate to the end very quickly.  It has a sandbox feel as there are so many choices.   Once a few players gets their engine going, the game accelerates to the end quickly.  

This is my number 3 game out of 555 unique games played over the past few years.  I love this game.  It seems that all paths have their strengths and weaknesses and you have to react to what other people are doing.

Having said this, it is a bear to teach (45 min to 1 hour) and it has a learning curve.  With newbies at the table, the game can result in runaway wins for one player with one player running away with it.  5 player games often go 3 hours.

RATING: 2.5
Only played it online at boardgamecore.net.  Played 2p and 3p, with all features.  Unforgiving.  That single adjective best captures the nature of it.  Feels like work and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.

This is a game like Chess and Go in the sense that a difference in skill determines the winner every time.  The question then becomes: (1) is it worth investing the time and energy to master it and (2) can it be played with a group of friends of unequal skill level with everyone (including the less skilled players) enjoying the match?  My personal answers to both of those questions are no.  I already have a hard time when I win a game with friends where they did not enjoy the ride, I don't think I would be able to emotionally handle or enjoy winning a 3-4 hours game of this against less skilled players and/or lose a 3-4 hours game of this against more skilled players.  I also believe that with repeated plays a series of preferred openings will be apparent (as in Chess), and knowing/memorizing those openings and sticking to them will be needed, limiting the illusion of individual freedom.  Perhaps I am just too lazy to work when it's time to play, and this game requires work and gives little room for the kind of social interaction I enjoy:  the auctions, bluffing, negotiating, social deduction, and opportunities for shock and laughter that I anjoy.  I don't usually like to have to think three/four steps ahead and plot out the different outcomes to figure the best action, I like to follow my instinct, and here it will almost guarantee that I will be inconsequential, like playing Chess against a master relying on one's instinct only.  Last -- every time I play I feel bad -- games are supposed to be fun, and this one somehow makes me feel miserable both during and at the end, and no amount of cute graphics is going to fix that.

First impressions : 
no game surprised  so much as this title recent years. 
The first play, I didn't understand what I was doing, but I a was already blown away !
very streamlined rules ; no exceptions, a jewel of board game design.  Good theme. Original game play.
Tactical and strategic possibilities are overwhelming.
Very deep and interactive game. 
I really need more plays of this wonderful game.

update after 5 plays : 

Short description : chess 2.0  with a food taste

Long description :   
-Unique pick-up-and-deliver game
-Fantastic spatial and card puzzle with a twist.

The game is excruciatingly difficult : 
 - Every turn is an optimisation exercise in job choice, money management, food production (5 different ones!), marketing, payroll, available number of slots, jockeying for turn order position next round...  If you fail in one category, you are maybe already in trouble !
  -  It's a merciless race game ; you always have to be aware what the other player's goals are; not only to grab the milestones, but also to see if you are  behind in the race of the tob jobs.
Keeping up with the pace of the other players is important. 

The game rules are streamlined ; excellent integration of theme and mechanics. 
But make no mistake : you need at least 10 games to have a  grasp of  the spatial subtleties of the modular board, jobs and milestones. The relative importance of the jobs and milestones  is heavily influenced by the initial board position. Delicate balance between short term and strategic goals. 

The game starts very slow, but suddenly accelerates with incredible speed. You desperately try to follow the insane pace of the game ; it boils down to struggle for adaptation versus going your own way...unless you are ahead in the race. Then you can rule the waves. 

The game is very unforgiving ; one error... and you can hope to do better next game !

I went deep into research on this one before purchasing because the price tag was hard to justify.  Turns out it's worth the money.  I lost hard.  I knew I should have started with the early Recruiting Girl or the early Trainer strategy, but I didn't--someone started waitress and I needed that bonus money to pay $20 in salaries first.  That hurt me the whole game.  I felt the pressure of having a competitor next door that I just couldn't beat.  I slowly formed my head-cannon family-operated business and worked my way to getting the first radio marketing... only to have my opponents blitz billboards across town while supplying all those refrigerated pizzas and burgers they hoarded!  The beauty of this game is in the stories you tell afterward.  The ugly is the setup and cleanup.

Played once. Interesting and want to play again, but not sure of a rating just yet. Building up your engine is fun, but the game can suddenly be turned on its head by something you or an opponent does, that takes some getting used to.
After two plays, I tentatively rate it a 7: usually willing to play. I thought I had a pretty good handle on the game, but once again something unexpected happened and I couldn't sell a single item in the last two rounds. This is unusual and interesting, but also frustrating. I guess I need to get better at this game and then it might be great (if my opponents are also getting better), I'm willing to keep trying.

This is a game I've been seeking for a long time. Great strategy, economics, complexity. I struggle with the beginning battle over the first few milestones, and the often swift and brutal ending. A player can come back from nothing and win by hundreds with the right move, and while you should be able to block this with proper strategy, it's a lot to keep track of. I mean, I should've seen the guy hiring 2 truck drivers and a zepplin drive with the double radio campaigns... (Starts thinking about more strategy) 9 for the frustration, but seriously what's a 10?!

I won't get into too much detail since it might as well be a giant review, so I'll just list my main issues:

- Horrible artwork with a drab color scheme does not warrant the high price tag

- Runaway leader problem, mainly due to a silly mechanic centred around "sell all or nothing"

- Way too much clean up and set up.  With the numerous amount of card piles, there is no tray or anything to organize them well so it takes up the entire table.  Again, this is a game priced at a premium, this should've been included.

- A game with simple mechanics that overstays its welcome.  The only difference between the beginning of the game and end of the game is higher numbers.  Instead of producing 1 burger, you produce 8.  Hooray.  Like Risk, you're doing the same thing over and over again for several hours.

- Too much downtime, especially if you're not leading.  As I've mentioned in my previous point, the longer game is just higher numbers.  You have 5 or 6 slots filled with cards?  The person before you has 12.  They will take 10 to 15 minutes to finish their turn.

- Unforgiving to the point where you can tell who can win before the bank first breaks, making the length of the game burn into your psyche.  Even after 3 hours, the rest of the table conceded (we were about 2 or 3 turns away) because it was obvious who would win.

Probably the worst game of 2017 and makes me question how this mess of a Eurogame managed to get the praise and high rating.

Comments: After 1 play with milestones, I have to say that there is A LOT going on in this game. Yes, the game is intuitive. True, the mechanisms are not overly complex. But, there's still a ton to keep track of and look out for. I found that, in order to teach this game (after reading the rule and watching a play through), I still needed to walk through the directions step-by-step rather than paraphrasing. That said, after just 1 play, I could probably explain it in half the time. The gameplay is quite interesting in that it is *extremely* slow building, which I'm guessing is supposed to simulate a slow start to a new business. In other words, for the first 3-4 rounds, you are not completing the full round because you haven't fulfilled all the stages. That's quite rare. I'm used to this in the first round, but not first several rounds. It didn't bother me though. In fact, I enjoyed that slow build-up, especially while I was learning the game. I wonder if I'll enjoy it as much in future games, or if it will feel "scripted." Either way, I'm curious to find out. Another thing that you should be aware of is that this is a LONG game. With 2 players, both playing for the first time (including setup, takedown and rules explanation), this game took about 4.5 hours. So, be mindful of that when you are considering breaking this one out (and we are not typically AP prone). I can see how the game is unforgiving, but at the same time, my wife went being ostensibly out of the game, to taking a commanding lead in one turn. So, for all it's "harshness,"  the game is quite swingy, which can be good for catch up. Last, I will say that the game has a sandbox feel. The variability in strategy seems nearly infinite, with so many career paths to follow. That's a good thing in my mind.

Do I like the game? Yes. Do I love the game? Yes. The components are awesome, with the little food tokens and cutesy pieces. It definitely evokes a 1950's theme. I really like the card backs, the thick rulebook, and most of all, the player aid. For a Splotter, this game is top-notch. Even the box is quite sturdy and a good size (Treefrog size). Most importantly, I feel like I'm running a 1950's fast food chain. A home run! I can't wait to play again.

I can respect the design, but that's about all i can say. FCM plays like a lifestyle CCG game if you ask me. The learning curve is pretty steep, and first timers will get destroyed. Gameplay is pretty boring, and the board isn't much to look at visually at all. Not quite as bad as some make it out to be, but after 4 hours..yeah it had me comatose in boredom.. so much fun i can hardly stay awake.

Played once, love it, and can see why it has been getting critical praise.  I think I was the only one in my play group that preferred Indonesia to this one (also recently played), but I like both.

Bought from funagain games flash sale 12/12/16.

Amazing game that maintains a high level of tension with every hire and decision point.  Every action really has far reaching consequences.  This does, however, work against the game a bit, as it results in scripted openings (Recruiting Girl 1st turn to get first to 3 hires).  However, the game really does open up.  It's sandboxy a-la caverna, but your opponents' play / competition for milestones / map layout do give some direction.

The "career paths" (aka tech trees) are my favorite part of the game.  It feels somewhat like leveling up a character in an old school RPG and teching their skills up.  This constant cycle of recruiting / training / producing ensures that the game has a smooth sense of escalation that results in satisfying amounts of building.

One of the great concerns with FCM was its ability to be mean.  This usually comes from the ability of an opponent to steal business with more effective advertising or price cutting.  While it is competitive, it doesn't feel mean.  Rather, the timing of advertising gives you a 1 turn warning, allowing you to plan a counter strategy.  It's not mean on the level of something like Dominant Species, where you're tearing down an opponent.

Art on the cards is great and thematic.  However, the tile art looks like something from a prototype.  Our enjoyment of this was greatly increased after making Chris Cormier's upgraded tiles.

+ High Interaction
+ Lots of tension
+ Career paths offer variety and satisfying sense of building
+ Highly thematic mechanics
o Highly competitive, but not destructively mean
o Very sandboxy, but the board does offer some direction
- Scripted openings
- Tile art

An extremely unforgiving game, especially in 2 player and where there is a difference in experience levels.  The vast array of choices dissuades analysis paralysis, but the critical nature of some decisions throws it right back in.  There is no catch up mechanism, and the possibility for massive swings makes this game more brutal than any dudes on a map game that I've ever played.  Like walking a tightrope across a spiked pit.

There are some fun decisions but this is overwhelmed by the inherent danger, and constantly changing structure is fiddly.  Many other games I'd choose before this a one. And I'd refuse to play it 2 player again - I miss it though that much of a masochist.  At least at 2 player game can be resigned, but getting stomped in  3 player or 4 player game would just be tedious.

Lots of components and bits.  Nice artwork.

There is a lot going on in this game!  Things happen fast -- well, not /fast/; unlike The Great Zimbabwe this game has a baked-in lag time between doing something and seeing the result -- but turns can be absolutely devastating.  We're talking sledgehammer body blows here, folks.  Turn order management may be more key than in TGZ.  The money snowballs and will probably end the game a turn or two before you think, until you get used to it.

Card racks are essential.  Laminated milestone chart is essential.  Foodstuff supply tracker is essential.  I don't usually accuse games of being fiddly but this game is fiddly without the aforementioned items.

A preliminary rating. 

The game is as described in the rulebook: unforgiving. If you make a mistake, you hope your opponent will make a similar or worse mistake. There is a lot going on and a lot to think about when playing this game. The choices are numerous, but you can't take everything you need. You need to make a choice and try to get the other players in your flow. Sometimes the game is also about bluffing/taking risks, just (2nd) guessing your opponent and planning accordingly (and hopefully it turns out good).

I'm still not sure if I like it... Need to play more! :)

[b]2016-01-09 8.8[/b] After 2x Intro 2x Full Plays:
Great strategy game where every. single. move. matters. In the proper full game, the accomplishment of initial milestones define your general strategy for that particular game, but player still has to pay close attention to the board and seize opportunity to sell. Unlike typical engine-building games, if your build up is not quick enough, other players might break the bank and force a game end. Each game feels different and scales well across different player count as the board size changes. The level of "cut-throat-ness" is the group's choice. One could play a mean game and screw with others' target households without direct benefit to oneself. A good tug of war in the closed economy, this game would have got an even higher rating if it doesn't reward the experienced player that much.

Tenuous - only keeping due to it being a "Splotter"

Good but eh, something is irksome in a bad way compared to my favourite, Zimbabwe. 

It's far less abstracted and more sprawling than Zimbabwe (the closest parallel that I know of). Clearly  there are aspects shared by both in terms of logistics and utilising your few but powerful special powers. Removed is the auction and the "sloshing" of money between players (this is much closer to a snowball-type game, but straddles the line as your engine is never anything more than a hard fought positional advantage), and the theme makes this game instantly much easier to grasp (after all, market, sell, earn money isn't a foreign concept, while gift-giving in Zimbabwe kind of is).

What makes this game for me is the spatial aspect - it doesn't feel like an afterthought like it does in Keyflower, but really is central to the game and that's how it avoids becoming a strict snowball efficiency-race. So you hire, you market, you train, you fire, you produce and sell and do your best to maintain an advantage on the board, always a step ahead of your opponents - or the opposite, you lurk just a step behind instantly taking advantage of the possibilities they open up.

A great game, I like it better with 2 players than I do Zimbabwe, with more I don't know (though I think I like Zimbabwe more due to its compressed abstracted and "purer" nature, but this is more accessible).

UPDATE: Zimbabwe is just a whole lot better than this, though this is still great

Finally got my chance to play two player.  Yeas, it is really a good one.  A bit clunky when you get to the deliveries, but the card play is excellent and the economy works well, as does the choosing of the game length.  And, yes, it can be brutal.  We took about two hours, so not too bad.

A heavy euro that actually delivers in its theme! Overwork and underpay the employees in a giant bureaucracy. Make your own Hooters with an array of waitresses. Who needs actual food? Price gouge your customers, market an apparent Coke addiction in the neighborhood, and bankrupt your rivals by undercutting them constantly. The game is a cut-throat brain burner, and I actually enjoy the 50's aesthetic of it, even if the board is a bit bland.

Great game. Especially enjoy the early buildup and race for the first milestones. Choosing my first workers reminds me a lot of clients in Glory to Rome.

Only deduction for me is the very long playtime. Also, checking who sells what and for how much gets quite tedious. That said, we did not really notice the time most of the time.

Rating based on the intro game. Pretty interesting puzzle here. I really like the way hiring, training, and marketing take a full turn to be realized, giving opponents a chance to react. Likewise, turn order is critical in screwing people over. I suspect salaries and milestones will really change this game up, possibly for the worse for me, as the decision space becomes larger and I fail to keep up with people who are smarter than me, but I'm eager to try the full game.

Update: Played the full game 6 times and I'm loving it. Upgrade 7 -> 8 with good potential to go higher. Surprisingly fast playing. Stay flexible and you won't get punished much. Thinking about this game a lot and always want to play it more.

This game is brutally difficult and wonderfully engaging. I love the puzzle of building my organization and trying to keep up with the "milestone rush".

Some further thoughts:
I find the beginning of the game a little daunting, as it's easy to take a misstep there and get left behind. I also wish there was a bit more tactical wiggle room later in the game, but perhaps that's down to my still limited experience. I don't see either of these things as problems with the game itself, but it does mean I need to be in the right mood to tackle it.

Food Chain Magnate has a lot going for it. I like the variability of the modular board and the tremendous variety of paths that seem to be available to you. The theme is excellent and well integrated into the game. The rules come together in a surprisingly intuitive fashion.

But there are some limitations. Our first game was a whopping three hours, most of which was just watching the leader extend his lead. I don't mind that this is a "punishing" game, requiring good play to stay competitive, but there should be a way to hasten the end--or slow the leader--when an immutable blowout is underway. In addition, this game has the annoying and tiresome feature of the super-combo tableau of cards, in which someone chains together two dozen actions in a row while everyone else sits and watches. Finally, the calculation of who delivered where got old, repeatedly counting the same number of spaces between restaurants and houses, adding price cuts, checking Waitresses over and over again. I feel like this part of the game--and probably others--could have been streamlined.

In the end, Food Chain Magnate almost feels more like an "experience" game than a hard core strategy game I really want to sink my teeth into. It's sprawling and has a lot to explore. I kind of just want to have fun with it, but I'm not sure how much that's really possible.

This is only my opinion and I know that most people will disagree, will point out that I'm wrong and that this was just a one game experience, but all this is subjective, I know what I like and I didn't like all these things... was expecting something else and was hyped and got pretty disappointed...

There were to many things that to me are important in such a long game that just don't sit well with me and I have to say that I feel that people would be much quicker to judge these aspects that I mentioned if this wasn't a Splotter game... if this was any other company game I bet the number of threads talking about these things would be so high that the game would be doomed!!

Even though the presentation looks like a proto-type, the game is an incredibly tight, tense, competitive business simulation. The way the "Dinner Time" phase plays out is  fun, interactive and surprisingly elegant.  The complexities of the interactions allow for some deep, strategic & tactical planning with regards to the employee tech tree.  

Player interactions in this game are confrontational and frustrating: player 1 creates demand, player 2 steals those customers away.  Player 1 creates demand for lemonade, player 2 negates it by also creating demand for pizza.  For a game that requires so much planning and investment, the "take that" elements can be extremely unpleasant.

FCM is both an abstract placement/route connection board game using tiles and an engine builder where you build up an organisation structure from company CEO downwards, recruiting new staff and training them though their career paths to develop their skills and effectiveness. The theme is that of food production, marketing & sales to meet demand either faster or at a lower price than other players. The game length is determined secretly at the start of the game and revealed once the bank goes bust for the first time. We played the longest game possible. I just love this game as everything you do impacts something else etc etc etc. I went for a lean mean organisation and only had 10 employees at the end and finished a close second in a 3 player game. Downtime with 4 player is a known issue. The sweet spot is apparently 3 players and the game is very brutal if you make errors. This stands out as my favourite Splotter game by a long way.

This was my first Splotter game, and I wasn't really sure what to expect going in. First game was planned to be a full game, but we decided to call it shortly after the bank ran out the first time.

This game is excellent. It combines so many things I like into a single game, and while it can be a little long and fiddly, it really strikes a chord with me. The tech tree/deck builder hybrid that makes up the central core of this game works incredibly well, and I love how you have to balance all the different jobs in order to do well. I do think that the achievements can sometimes reward the rich a little too much for my tastes, but this does encourage repeated play and coordinated take-downs to improve your play.

My interest has been sparked, and I plan on checking out other Splotter games if I find any available.

UPDATE: Other Splotter games don't measure up to this one, in my opinion. That being said, I've played this more using the full game rules, and I have to admit that this has really blown me away. So many choices, and only a few can be made every round. The lack of any luck outside of the initial setup may ultimately be the one thing against FCM, but otherwise this game is amazing. Definitely a 10 in my book.

Tricky game, huge learning curve, opaque and frustrating turn order and scoring process until you get used to it. Quite unforgiving until you start to see what you can do and what your opponents are up to, then it becomes a tough struggle with opponents in all aspects of the game. I haven't decided if I like it or find it really rewarding. You should be able to calculate a strategy and comparison with opponents on sales but it's a big effort to do so.

RATING: 6.5
You are the CEO of a restaurant. Each turn, you have to decide what type of people to hire, then you decide what type of beverage and foods to produce, then if you want to advertise and finally try to sell your food while undercutting the competition. 
Your org chart can only fit a certain size, and so you have to balance your restaurant size with paying salaries to expand. There are bonuses for achieving certain milestones, such as the person to hire the first waitress or first person to dump food to get a fridge.  The bonuses help you pay for things throughout the game.

The summaries are printed out like a menu, and the game components are nice.

However, it is not a very forgiving game. I've played twice, but never finished, since it seems to take around 4 hours to play. One person can get a lead such as by building  garden, and if people don't react properly there can be a runaway winner. Like The Great Zimbabwue, there is a calculation part of where you move your food to sell, and you have to count and optimize. I'm not fond of those games where you have to slow down and look around and start optimizing, especially if the graphics of the board are not entirely intuitive. Granted, you have to play a couple of times to understand roads and houses and blocks. But it is a bit of a chore to do that and it slows the game down. The Splotter Games generally get really good ratings, but they don't seem to be my type of game. On the other hand, I do like the idea of the org chart and how to try to make it as best as possible, so I like that aspect, but I dislike the selling of food phase. I'm willing to try again, but I have to be in the right mood for it.

The gameplay is a 10.
The components are probably a 7 (great cards, ok board, terrible money)
Even so, I rate it a 10, because it's the only game that I can't stop thinking about after the gameplay ends. I just want to play again and again.

Strategy is deep. It may be a bit scripted at the very beginning, but the game is so long, that doesn't seem like a problem. Diversification of strategies come quick. You can trace every result back to a decision you made, good or bad.

The tech tree combined with area control is a great combination. I didn't think I would like the cutthroat nature of the game, but I turned out loving it.

Just not my kind of thing. A graphic design that could charitably be described as perfunctory and at least twice as much bookkeeping and setup time as I like in my games are just the start of the problems here. More damning is a ruleset that only flirts with thematic consistency, leading to oddball outcomes (the way that marketing is handled is particularly strange, for example, as are the feast-or-famine results of the feeding phase). Ultimately the game seems to be centered around gaining player powers via reaching milestones and maximizing a (somewhat nonsensical) tech tree, so there's theoretically a lot of room for replay and depth of strategy. In practice, said tech tree just results in dozens of rules exceptions for each player to keep track of. Ultimately, the core round structure and range of options is fairly unappealing and not terribly fun, so I doubt I'll return for seconds.

I love the cutthroat nature of this game and how you can be out of it with a couple of bad plays. It's a nice change of pace.
It's unforgiving for new players.
I do feel the game is slightly broken with 3 players, with only 1 type of certain personnel, but it's still good if you are playing with people who are aware of it.
I also feel that the game doesn't need to be taken to the end, after it is clear who the winner will be. People can just stop and start again. That is one of the criticisms this game has and is easily avoided.

While Splotter Spellen is not a company known by the aesthetics of its games -quite the contraty, in fact- I loved the fifties infography. The wooden pieces are cool. The board it's quite insipid but pragmatic. I only disliked the cardboard marketing tokens. The player aids in the form of long diner menus are just great. FCM is certainly the best looking Splotter “spiele”.

It's a heavy economic euro about managing a food company and competing with your rivals. It also presents you some goals or milestones that will tempt you to deviate from the ideal/planned strategy in order to obtain powerful effects that can change your game.

The core mechanism -and also the main attractive one- is how to manage your staff tree. You recruit, train, specialize, use, fire and pay them. Everyone has a special effect, allowing you to manipulate almost any area of the game.

Food Chain Magnate is a heavy euro game, but it's also very thematic. The mechanisms provide a believable abstraction about getting food and drinks, advertising them and selling them. The interaction is quite intense; right from the bat, you compete for the milestones that will produce key permanent (or instant) effects. A few turns into the game, you will start a fierce price competition with everybody until the very last turn. During all the game, you will also fight for the very important turn order.

There are many things to like about this game. My favorite feature is probably the many diverse strategies it promotes.

On the other side, it's a very long and quite unforgiving as well. Usually some players will find themselves out of the race early, and this game is not fun at all if you're not competing (there are other games where you can still have fun creating your engine or doing other things; not this one though). Also, every player chooses their prices secretly when choosing the active staff, and then everybody reveals them at the same time; this creates a random effect that doesn't fit well in such a heavy game. And my last complaint, I can see this game reduced to a price competition, about who can sell cheaper; in that case, it can drag a lot, because games are played until the bank runs out of money, and that can take a lot of time when players sell cheap.

Giocone della Splotter Spellen. Bello, entra tra i miei 3 preferiti della SS con Bus e Indonesia. Il gioco è più semplice del previsto come regolamento, anche se la spiegazione non è corta. La principale difficoltà sta nel prendere confidenza con le molte carte in gioco, mentre le meccaniche e dinamiche sono tutto sommato immediate. Calzante l'ambientazione che riesce a calare i giocatori nel contesto e lo fa divertendoli. A rendere il gioco molto gradevole sono le numerose strategie attuabili, la folle corsa alle principali Milestones e la durata imprecisata della partita. Questi elementi rendono il gioco longevo e rigiocabile, anzi mette proprio voglia di rigiocarci spesso. Ci sono però un paio di cose che non mi gradisco, oltre alle imprecisioni sulle carte 'infinito' delle prime edizioni e il numero insufficiente di alcune Milestones (niente di realmente grave ma inspiegabili se paragonati al prezzo), trovo la grafica e il materiale di quello che dovrebbe essere il tabellone di gioco poco gradevole, così come alcuni componenti quali edifici e giardini. Carini invece i disegni sulle carte anni '50. Sulle meccaniche non ho grossi appunti, giocando in 5 giocatori si avvertono tempi morti che con l'esperienza comunque un po' si riducono. Trattandosi di un gioco della Splotter è destinato a rimanere in auge per molto tempo, il gioco ha sorprendentemente avuto già diverse ristampe. Il gioco ha vinto meritatamente il premio Magnifico 2016.

Rating after one play: I really enjoyed the simple ruleset (for a Splotter) and yet how deep and wide open this game is. I'll have to play it many times more to explore all the various strategies. We all sort of just copied each other the first game and the person who didn't got left behind. 

9 for now. Strong chance at a 10. 12/23/2015

Yep, this is a 10. It's fantastic. It's the first game in three years to challenge Trajan's #1 spot. Feld still holds for now, but we'll see.

Lo coloco porque empezamos a sacarlo a la mesa (dos partidas por ahora en el grupo). Aunque todavía estamos lejos de tener formada una opinión definitiva al respecto, ya lo veo saliendo muy seguido en las próximas reuniones, porque promete una experiencia extraordinaria.

En esencia, es un juego muy pro e implacable (unforgiving), donde hasta la primera decisión tiene enormes consecuencias para el resto de la partida. No sé cómo enfatizar ésto. Es pro e implacable al punto que Caylus parece un gateway en comparación. Por supuesto, en lo personal me resulta extraordinario, por más que nuestra última partida hayamos hecho cualquiera. Y no cualquiera a nivel de las malas decisiones que cometemos en las gameplay por acelerar el paso de la partida en vivo. Hablo de CUALQUIERA con mayúsculas, en el sentido de
"COMO NO LO VI!!! LRPMQLRMP!!!! "

Yo dupliqué al tercero, pero Lepo me ganó por 400 mangos (una tonelada de plata). Pero lo roto no era el juego, eran los jugadores.

Lo interesante es que pensándolo y conversándolo después, pudimos entender todos los caminos que podríamos haber tomado y qué infinidad de combinaciones te ofrece el juego para que cualquier jugador pueda encarar cualquier tipo de situación. Es una engine asombrosa.

Ese nivel de opciones estratégicas lo logra sin tanta complicación. Las reglas no son tan complejas para un juego de tan tremenda profundidad. Podés entender cómo jugarlo y jugarlo de una sentada si alguien te lo explica sin demasiado detalle. Claramente el desafío es dejar de ser horrible en tus decisiones, una propuesta que me atrapa completamente.

Si, la producción es meh en términos de componentes, pero esa engine tiene toda la pinta de una obra maestra.

Tengo que volver a jugarlo YAAAA

RATING: 7
There are some interesting dynamics re who's going to produce what next turn, who's going to meet what demand, and at what price ... which then help you decide whether you should be competing to meet the demand that other players have created through their marketing campaigns and beating them to the punch with lower price, or going your own way to create your own demands and meeting that instead for higher revenue. The game seems loaded with brain-burny if-then scenarios. At the strategic level, it seems to be one of determining how many turns the game will go and when's the best time to switch from investment (training up your mgt hierarchy) to revenue generation (with the best guys you've got) and will that revenue be enough to win the game when the bank runs out, and can you sustain that revenue once other people's big guns come out to play. Which can make for devastating end-game plays where a player thinks they'll be making money but get swamped out. This isn't a game for the feint-hearted, and can leave a bitter taste. Lots of interesting exploration options though.

RATING: 5
Not nearly as dynamic as I had hoped. Early game is just "who's going to successfully rush Guru vs. choose a slummier strategy". If the Guru players rush Brand Directors the game gets even less interesting - now the Guru players decide the 2 or 3 things that households will demand for the rest of the game.

I realize the Gurus aren't uncounterable, but I am uninterested in playing again after < 5 full games. If this is Splotter at their best then I'm unimpressed. Give me Agricola any day.

RATING: 1
Rating is for the ridiculous price, poor components that dont warrant that price, worst looking board I jave ever seen, and the tedious Spock clones that populate the FCM forums (REPRESENTING the game) and can't take a price joke without going all Hannibal on you. I finally bought my first micro badge for FCM, but it's sarcastic. Based on components, this is a cheap ass 'envelope' game that should sell for $20. Splotter is running the biggest scam in gaming right now.

RATING: 10
Latest release from Splotter ...another classic in the making ...top quality components ...top quality game play that I suspect mirrors the trials and tribulations of the fast food industry...only this game will not make you fat, give you type 2 diabeties or metabolic syndrome...unless of course you want to stuff yourself with said products whilst playing this game ...

Only thing missing is the chemist milestone ...after all most fast food starts its life as a series of chemicals in a lab ...not a kitchen ...

Love this game and would like to play it more. I feel as though the more I play it the more I like it. DO NOT play this with someone who is a sore loser because this game will not hold your hand. One turn can put you behind for the entire game.

RATING: 9
Really rich, rewarding game that offers a lot of planning and multiple paths to victory. Possibly the CFO seems a little overpowered but we haven't played enough to be certain.
The mechanics are so new and interesting, adjusting your hand turn on turn is a game in itself
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I have only played this game a few times, but that is unfortunately enough. It's a good implementation of really interesting mechanics, but it doesn't allow much variation. Yes you can use several different strategies to win, but every game still feels to much the same as last time so you get done with the game quite fast. 

I don't like the fact that getting the customers is mostly one takes all, and it is really hard to catch up and steal customers from the leader. I would have liked a map where distance made more difference. 

Even though all the negative aspects above I really like the game, thus the high rating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game with unique mechanics. Strategically very deep. Punishes mistakes and poor play. The game can be mean at times in that players can adversely affect others. My opinion is that this does not negatively impact the game, however new players are at a considerable disadvantage especially with regards to the milestones (e.g. Knowing which to pursue to align with strategic descisions).

Currently, would not turn down a game.

This was a tough one to rate.  I respect the design a great deal, but it's simply too much of a muchness for me to want to play it more.  I will happily do so if one of my groups brings it out and wants to play it, but I won't be the one suggesting it.

RATING: 6
The rules are not that complex, the game play is as decisions you make early can haunt you later. You hire employees to sell food on the map to houses but the complexity escalates really quickly as what you sell is effected by others. It is also very difficult to catch up if you get far behind even if you try to gang up on the leader. The game can be very long especially for those behind as catching up can be insurmountable. For an economic engine game there are much better ones and less repetitive ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
About as close to perfection as you can get. Simple in its design and execution, yet almost limitless in its middle and late game strategies. The retro artwork is not very common, which makes the game fun to look at. What I enjoy most is the very low reliance on luck. If you win, you earned it from out thinking your opponents. You lost, you have no game mechanism to blame other than your brain.

RATING: 6
A pretty decent game. There are a few issues though. The first being some of the balance with the goals. Another is the shite components for the exorbitant price. These guys must be pocketing at least 40 Euros per copy they flog. I found the whole rejigging your business structure every turn tactically interesting but really taking away from the flow and theme of the game. There doesn't seem to be an engine if you know what I mean. 13/03/16

Update: yeah still an 8. Still feel this is getting more praise than it really deserves. CFO is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Should be pretty much over before then if players have any idea. 18/3/16

Update: yeah probably best if I rerate to a 7.5. The issues I've described still resonate poorly with me. 30/3/16

Update: on reflection I still think the 50% bonus for getting to $100 first is a little OP. The nature of just getting waitresses without production and getting paid seems daft too. Still not a bad game just thematically... well this is basically an abstract with a slapped on theme.

Food Chain Magnate is Another heavy economic game from Splotter in which you're trying to produce and sell food and drinks to customers, subject to travel restrictions on a map board. More than anything else, though, it's an HR management game--most of the decisions revolve around deciding who to hire and train on a tech tree of labor skills. Players must not only produce the food items, but also use marketers to create demand for them. Other roles include managers that let you have more employees, HR people that let you hire more people, trainers that let your employees advance up the tech tree, and other miscellaneous roles that let you build more restaurant locations or even erect new houses for customers. The game rewards early action with a number of achievement cards that provide a permanent bonus, mostly for diving right into production, but investing in infrastructure early on may yield more flexibility down the road. It's definitely a difficult game, and you have to be quick to react when others create demand. I enjoyed this, but got caught flat-footed several times as the game state changed and I was powerless to adjust accordingly.

2-5. Good with two. Maybe too heavy for my taste. Takes too much time? Splotter Games. 50ies theme, which I like, yet with ugly and empty retro graphic design.

RATING: 9
One play so far with the introductory rules. Quite an interesting game although I think it would be much better with the milestones. Felt a bit weak without them. I look forward to more plays of this game.

Kind of annoyed with the production issues (missing infinity symbols) and the lack of milestone cards with 4+ players. Not really a big deal, but just frustrating.

Also, my box came with a very large dent in the bottom right corner. Still very serviceable, but it's very dinged up.

[b]Update[/b]: Finally after a very long time do I get another play in, this time with 4 players. We played the full shebang with milestones and everything. I have to say I was quite impressed with the game. Keeping track of milestones was a bit of a pain since they were much easier to get than I realized at first glance. The differences in map tile positions can be quite varying offering very different marketing campaigns as well as what drinks are available. Not sure how drastically different each game is going to be, but I think you have a lot to mull over each time. Bumping this one up a notch in rating. Now I need to play 2 player again with everything.

Extras: Card holder and milestones boards. All cards sleeved in FFG American standard.

I'm a kid on Christmas eve excited to receive my copy of FCM tomorrow!  I haven't been this excited in years.  I've played once in person and a few times online (our league is in its third season).  I LOVE THIS GAME!  If there's a negative to the game, it's that I spend so much time thinking about the game that it's difficult to attempt simultaneous plays, as I just don't seem to have the working memory to parse multiple games.  Otherwise, I'd definitely be playing in the BGG league too.  How can I rate this game other than a 10?

Complex game, usually described as 'unforgiving'. This simulates establishing, marketing and managing a fast food outlet. It is an impressively detailed simulation; to the extent that it looks like rather hard work (to play).

RATING: 6
I really like Splotter games-- they are really well thought out and usually have variable routes to victory, which I really like, The learning curve is a bit steep, and my first play of FCM suffered since I placed my first restaurant badly and by the time I realized how bad that placement it, I had a hard time course correcting. I would definitely play this again though and probably my rating would go up with more plays.

Awesome game.  Adds some tech-tree goodness to a spatial element. I am not as crazy about the reverse order of the phases (it is a neutral for me). The planning required because of this element hasn't gone over well with some members of my group, though, so it may not see much table time. It is a bit too heavy for my partner as well.

(1 play)  I really enjoyed the management and people aspect of building the company, and the establishing of market strengths in the early game really made the theme for me.  It was fun to target specific milestones and compete to get an early advantage in the market.  The central game board was a fiddly mess of counting and figuring out edge case rules - the end result being not very fun or dramatic.  The other components of the design more than make up for this shortcoming, but wipe and re-build that part of the game and there may be a top contender somewhere in this design.  A re-theme wouldn't hurt either.

Have yet to play this game in person, but I've played plenty of games online and it's absolutely perfect.  There is no defined "best strategy" and besides the initial go to move (recruit girl) the game is so vast in how you can win.  I've never experienced this in a game before and it's crazy how many experimental strategies I can fathom for this game.

Finally played it in person and it's a million times better in person.  This game will be in my library for a long time, and surprisingly the game is easier than I thought to teach.

RATING: 6
I know it's hard to probably judge this game after only 1 play, but these are my findings:

In my 1 play I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of our game, I actually thought Splotter would finally have made a game I could really enjoy and was worth his high selling price. But the last 1/3 completely destroyed all the good feelings I had before. So a little reconstruction of our game:

First you have the inevitable race for the milestones, which is perfectly fine as you can chose to follow or to go for something different. But then the game sort of splitted up: where 3 players played 'positive' and already invested in advertisement and production in the hope to get some income, the 4th player sort of builded up a powerful engine, getting his sole income from waitresses, but for instance he could hire a person and upgrade it twice in the same turn, which gave him a lot of flexibility. So while the others created certain needs, he made a super factory, baked 8 pizzas and 8 burgers and collected all the drinks he wanted in a single turn and then positioned his restaurants cleverly so that he would fulfil all demands. By doing that, there was 1 full round where he simply cleared the board and made almost $ 150 as he had off course also a CFO. And the round after that he fulfilled 3/4 of the demands. We had played 2 hours at that point and everybody simply knew that player would win: as his card engine was by far better, he could anticipate to everything (if you would take a Discount Manager that gives - $3, he could simply do the same AND some other stuff), but the game still lasted for 1 extra hour and there was only $ 600 extra in the bank :s

That brings me to the 2 major concerns I have with this game:

1)  If you wanna win this game, you have to be the better leech. You simply have to let others make the efforts (like advertisement or building gardens) and then make sure you take the profits from their sweat. And off course you can argue: everybody can play like that, which is off course true, but then then you can ask yourself if that's the kind of game you wanna play? I certainly not.
2) For me this was the first game, but the others had played 3 more games in total. In all of these games there seemed to be a breaking point at a certain moment: 1 player who could cash in big time after which everybody knew he/she would be the winner. If the games end shortly after that, that's not an issue. But if the games then still lasts for so long you could easily play a fun game instead (like in our case still 1 hour, and I'm horrified by the thought there would have been $ 1200 in the bank reserve at that point :s), then for me that's a big problem. 


It certainly leaves me puzzled: the first 2/3 makes me intrigued about this game, wanna found out more. But the last 1/3 says 'keep it in shrink, the resell value will be higher'.

Only downside is the display of all the cards can make the required playing area quite large, especially with more than two. External add-ons help to mitigate this.

Not one of their top three games

Steep learning curve. Might actually go pretty quick with experienced players. Pretty cutthroat.

Not yet sure about the "bank breaking" aspect. 

Avoid playing with 5 people. Best with 3.

If you like playing the same game over and over, this is good. But if you will only play it twice a year, avoid this. The round structure is straight forward, but so many cards to be aware of. If the games not fresh, it's much harder to have a functioning strategy. The fact that it's very unforgiving to mistakes compounds this issue

This game has some interesting ideas. I really like the way you build up your organisation and how this influences your options and strategy. One the one hand, this game intrigues me, and I'm curious to see how different approaches will work. However, I find that I'm not really enjoying the game when playing it.

So far, all of my games have been landslide victories for the one player that turned out to have picked the best approach. They never felt tense. I am confident this is cause by our inexperience, but I don't find the game fun enough to learn in these circumstances.

A major issue for me is how difficult it is to change your strategy combined with the huge swings a succesful attack or a mistake may bring. It is not a fun game to lose. I am also a bit dissapointed in the milestones, as most of them seem to support a specific strategy and are supposed to go out during the first few rounds. I was expecting them to be goals to work towards.

To say this game is unforgiving is an understatement. Through no obvious fault of your own, other player's actions can effectively eliminate you from this game, and that makes for a terrible time. In my first play this happened to me and I was ready to get rid of it. People coaxed me into playing it a second time, and this time, it sang to me. It's a deep strategy game where you need to be carefully tracking not your opponent's current moves, but what moves they are lining up to make on their next turn. One mistake can cost you the game, and it's a wild ride while you fight tooth and nail to make money each turn and not let your opponents steal your customers out from under you. This is a game where one moment you feel perfectly safe and are doing well, and the next moment you are up against a wall, teetering on the brink of destruction. Absolutely work more than one play. The steep learning curve can be conquered. Don't get discouraged and you will be rewarded.

RATING: 4
Dropped rating for several reasons:
 
1. Early player elimination is quite possible
2. Length of game. In today's day and age there are so many great games, if I'm going to play a 5 hour game it better be  really worth it
3. Race for reward cards scripts the early rounds and determines your fate for the rest of the game. Some rewards are unbalanced. Controlling the radio tower is too powerful.
4. Lack of control: Things can happen to you in this game that are hard to forsee. If they happen, you have zero control of them by that time. They will crush your company and eliminate you from the game and there is nothing you can do to stop it. I would be ok with this part of the game it if it was a 1 hour game, but at 4-5 hours that's too much for me. In our second game, I got eliminated after 3.5 hours, and it looked like the game could go another 2 hours before a winner was determined.

10 - I held off rating this because I was worried that my feelings were based on how new to me it was and that the excitement of the hunt was increasing the enjoyment.  After 6 plays I can only confirm that this game is phenomenal and I wish I could play it more. When you start getting into pricing wars the math can get fiddly but the game is outstandingly fun despite that.

A really good game. I hesitate to go to "great" because it has all of the typical problems of a multiplayer game. Runaway leader, kingmaking, etc. And then the game tries to be a very serious strategy game, which it is. A lot of deep and fun systems. I actually think the theming and art is super fun. But the problem is that its a super serious game in this multiplayer free for all shell. That's actually what makes the game punishing and unforgiving. There are actually plenty of games with the strategic depth of FCM, they just aren't multiplayer FFA. That said, its still really fun and a lot of strategic depth.

UPDATE 10/10/17: Played my first 4 player game yesterday. Was really fun. The game is definitely on par with games like Blood Rage and IA, both of which I really enjoy. Very different reasons why I enjoy those games, but the level of enjoyment is similar. This game is much more difficult to understand and I'm still trying to understand a lot of the late game strategy. 

UPDATE 10/11/17: Played my 2nd 4 player game yesterday. One person did not have fun at all the entire game because she got so behind. The flaws of the game are showing again. I'm not a person who doesn't have fun when you can't do anything or you're losing... but quite a few people are, and I want to play with them. I like the strategy of this game, but it needs some more lightness in it so that strategy can be combined with just fun so that people of different stripes can play together. Maybe I'm returning to my roots of strategy dice chuckers where the dice mitigates the punishing aspects of the game, but where there can still be quite a bit of strategy.

After one play of Food Chain Magnate I'm uncertain of exactly how I feel about this game. It seems immensely deep which I usually enjoy, but it seems very difficult to learn and do well. The game is mostly known information which I like, but there is so much stuff going on to keep track of that it was very hard to figure out what I should be doing, much less pay attention and try to predict what my opponents would be doing. 

The rules weren't that bad, but given all the effects of the various employees in the tech tree and the various achievements that are vital to the strategy of this game, it is pretty impossible to absorb them all during the first few plays. Alternatively to play well means to study and learn all those cards before making any decisions so you can lay out a plan. 

So all that is to say this game has a massive learning cure that means it really will only be fun when played among a group of fairly similarly experienced players. And actually given how zany the first few games can be with snowballing effects, it likely only really shines once you are playing with a group of experienced players. 

So the real question is was this game interesting enough to make me want to do that? And the answer is no. I liked it and will probably play again--but I will likely resign myself to the same fate that befell me in my first game--I will get crushed by the more experienced player with little idea of what to do better unless I put in the effort to really learn the game....and while I was more than happy to do so with other games, this one just feels more like work to get to that point. 

In the end I just don't find this game one that really makes me want to play it again and explore the depth it does offer.

The game is interesting, but a bit too fiddly (as one would expect for a Splotter) and chaotic (a single waitress or price reduction for one house could change the value of all future deliveries dramatically). The milestones feel odd; they are probably intentionally very strong to encourage differentiation in strategy but feel almost game-breaking. Graphics are otherwise good, but the map is ugly.

Excellent.  

The strategy is deep without being overly complex, and the modular, randomized map adds enough variance that the way to approach the game changes each time you play.  No single strategy is completely dominant, and there always seems to be a way to regain the upper hand on an opponent.  Doing so happens to be immensely rewarding, as there is no real element of chance.  

For example, flooding the board with demand for a product the opponent has difficulty producing can stop his or her strategy dead in its tracks.  Likewise, an opponent with dominant store positions can be undercut in price, creating a price war - and in the race to the bottom, a crafty player can increase demand and raise their own prices, thus making a killing on sales when opponents can't meet the volume of demand.

The flavor is unique and fun, and the retro 50's art style is fantastic.  I could go on and on, but I imagine you get the point.  

The only strike against this game is its length, which sits around 4 hours, but if game length isn't an issue for you and your group, then I highly recommend this one.

Pros:
1. Corporate Structure. This has a great mechanic of building out your employees from the top down. Poor planning on who you select as employees and how you build your structure can really hurt you.
2. Interaction. This game has great player interaction on the board. You can steal business from other players. You can move in to capitalize on another player's advertising. 
3. Brain Burner. This game is a super euro. Everything is deterministic. You will be thinking hard to puzzle out what to do.
4. Starting Locations. Where you choose to start your business has large implications on the rest of the game. This part of the game can be it's own little mini game.
5. First Hire Bonus. If you're the first player to get a certain type of employee down, you get a bonus. Other players can get the same bonus if they hire that employee in the same round. This creates a great dynamic of do you follow the path of the player a head of you to get the same bonuses or do you branch off to keep them from getting other bonuses.

Cons
1. Round Resolution. Resolving who gets to complete which orders can be extremely time consuming. You have to count out who's closes, where's the advertising, which restaurants produce, which routes are you taking to pick up drinks, what's the current demand. There's many things that interact on the board that can cause the resolution to be long and confusing.

Summary: This is a great brain burner of a game. It's fun to puzzle out how to boost your restaurants and steal demand from you opponents. It's one of the rare euros that actually hits a home run on having the mechanics fit the theme. Unfortunately this is a hard game to find for sale and it's fairly expensive. If you can get your hands on a reasonably priced copy. I highly recommend it.

RATING: 9.5
Truly excellent business game.  The rules are not complex, although it can take half a game to completely understand how demand is generated and how prices and distance work.

But it is also a game that can punish early mistakes, and they are easily made by the inexperienced or unwary.  In fact, it's very hard for any player to avoid making any mistakes; you just hope that your own mistakes aren't important ones!

I love the clear graphics and appearance of the game.

If it loses half a point anywhere, it's because putting tokens on the board then taking them off again can be a little fiddly; that a computer implementation that runs the marketing campaigns and mealtimes would be perfect (so long as it wasn't too fast for me to understand what was going on!).

A month later and another 6+ games and I remain firmly of the same opinion.  Except that I'm getting better at populating the map with tokens, and calculating which customers eat where.

Definitely my favourite business game.  Power Grid?  You're fired!

I won't rate this yet as I've only played it twice. 

This game is exceptionally good at providing tons of options and huge reward for thinking hard about your moves. It's the kind of game where, even after 30 plays, you'll still be learning new techniques.

My only concern is that playing it well requires you to look through opponents' cards, add-up a lot of information and generally do a lot of 'checking'. This won't be a problem for cyborgs or people with ultra-casual friends, but for mildly competitive human beings like me it can be a massive drain.

RATING: 8
Great engine building game with very good thematic integration of the mechanisms. You draft the actions you can do (i.e. hire personnel) and upgrade them (i.e. train your personnel). This upgrade-tree is the main engine of the game.

You first create demand for fast food and then compete with other players for the customers, by lowering the prices for your food. The board-tiles create a nice map with interesting topology.

You can earn extremely strong bonuses by achieving different tasks first (milestones). Because of this, the first games might be a bit hard for newcomers, since they can underestimate the engine building and the utility of these bonuses.

Update: After  about 5 face-to-face plays, most of which we did not finish, I lost a bit  interest in FCM, since  the physical handling of the components is extremely fiddly and time consuming (demand tokens, money, choosing which cards to play; adiministration of dinner time;  everything with new and kind of AP prone players is a bit too much then), even in comparison to other Splotter games as Indonesia. But then I played a few games online (boardgamecore) and I love the game. The spatial element, price wars, extreme swings; FCM has it all! The game is both tactical and strategic and you need both to win. 

The game  can play out extremely  differently: Sometimes players independently race to who can build an effective engine faster and other times it becomes highly interactive.

Two highly innovative mechanisms make this game a true masterpiece: First, the combination of price and distance to determine attractiveness for customers. Second, advertising of food instead of companies. The combination of both make the game highly interactive and interesting (I admire this as much as the merger mechanism in Indonesia). In consequence the game can become extremely mean as players undercut each other prices.

Even though I like the gameplay as much as Great Zimbabwe, I have to lower my rating a little bit due to handling problems of the physical implementation. Nevertheless, FCM is a great game.

RATING: 5
Hugely unforgiving system. This is an example of a game that you need to study beforehand and create a strategy before you play the game. Learning by playing is not fun, unless you want the game to last for many, many hours. The frustration caused by this game can be just huge to new players.

Since the milestones are removed from the game after somebody takes one of them, there is pretty much zero flexibility in strategy, you have to plan everything from the beginning, and since it is a Splotter game, you can ruin somebody's game if so wish.

The table space requirement is huge. Every player needs to have some sort player aid for the Milestones, thank god there is already one for the other cards.

I'm not particularly a Splotter fan - I've played a few of their games, and have enjoyed most of them (Antiquity, Roads and Boats, Indonesia), yet without being wowed by any. I wouldn't have been particularly interested in FCM - but my wife decided she wanted it and bought it back in January or February. It arrived soon afterwards, and I read the rules, but never found a chance to play.

I finally got a game in on the last day of June - not with our copy, but with that of another member of our local games club, who I didn't even realise had it but had a game all set up when I turned up late that night. I was of course more than happy to play it, so there we go.

Ultimately my reaction was not dissimilar to the other Splotter games I've played - a very interesting design which I'd be more than happy to play again, but without feeling particularly drawn to it. It will certainly take many plays to get used to how all the various elements of the game interact, and find good strategies - and I can't imagine being unhappy to play this if the time is available. Yet nor do I feel I'd go out of my way to play again. I have reasonable hopes that this may grow on me in future plays however.

A experiência foi horrorosa, terrível, dessas de ferir a dignidade. Não consegui fazer nada, não vendi nenhum lanche e terminei zerado.

Não quer dizer que o jogo seja horroroso, na verdade ele tem várias sacadas muito legais. Toda a mecânica do jogo é absurdamente temática, faz ele ficar fácil de aprender, tem muita interação, não tem um monte de regrinha e exceção, e é um jogo que vc sente que está jogando algo novo, diferente de tantos outros.

Mas tb é um jogo muito livre, deixa tudo muito solto, então vc fica livre pra cometer merdas homéricas tb, ainda mais em partida inicial. E pra piorar, quem está em vantagem tende a aumentá-la ainda mais (talvez pagando os salários, isso seja amenizado), então quem está perdendo pode acabar passando metade do jogo só assistindo.

Jogaria de novo? Com um pé e meio atrás, e com o jogo completo, torcendo pra não cometer os mesmos erros novamente pra não ser vítima de tal massacre, ainda mais que o jogo completo são 4 horas, e isso é muito tempo pra sofrer. Mas acho que não é pra mim não.

[u]The positive[/u]
(+) The art: you hate it or you love it, I love it. The components are real good quality with nice colorful wooden food markers and different types of bottles and a huge amount of really nice cards. However, the map tiles could have been printer on thicker cardboard. The player aids which stand on the table as 'player's menu's' are great.

(+) This game bursts of interesting player interaction. Since marketing campaigns promote food and not brands of restaurants, players are offered so many interesting ways to approach marketing and ways to react on other players marketing effords.

(+) The action system is nicely integreted into building up your company structure with cards. This also offers plenty of opportunity to build up a successful company in many different ways: will you go for a small company mainly focussed on producing some goods and reaching some critical milestones early, or will you build up your company into a huge monster, losing some time in the process but gaining a lot of flexibility and offering some real strong action possibilities later on? Both strategies can be very powerful and there are multiple ways to approach both paths.

(+) The milestones: so many of them, and still so powerful. You can feel the tension at the start of the game when people are trying their best to snatch away as many of them as possible!

(+) At first, I feared the random map-tile placement would possibly result in uninteresting map layouts, but this concern proved to be unjustified. Thanks to the many crossroads, a limited amount of 'bridges' and a few special road layouts, the random way the city is built results in interesting layouts offering different strategies each time a new map is formed.

(+) Very structured and logical rules. It takes little efford to teach and understand the game

(+) The game offers some real satisfaction when after carefully planning and building up your company and working the market, you see money flowing in so you can train your staff to achive more powerful actions.

(+) The game flows rather smoothly and turns go by quickly, this game does not have much downtime. Action selection happens simultaniously and all the actions of a turn are resolved together one player after the other. Little to no downtime

(+) Detail but a sure positive: The box is just the right size to fit the huge amount of game components in there. Thank you Splotter for not taking up more space than necessary in our games closet!

[u]The negative[/u]
(-) One critical error could have devestating results on a player. The game offers no way to catch up again after you made a serious mistake, but it offers the competition multiple ways to completely and utterly destroy a player lagging behind. Personally, I don't mind an unforgiving game, but you risk this happining to a (new) player each time you bring this game to the table and you can be sure that this person will not have a nice evening, which also reflects on the others.

(-) You need a *lot* of table space. Our 6 persons dining table is barely large enough to fit all the different cards. Luckily, you lose some decks early in the game when milestones are reached.

(-) Game involves quite some bookkeeping at the end of each round when food and drinks get sold. For each house you have to count out distance and price, when gardens are present price gets doubled, but bonusses are not - all that sort of things tend to break the smooth gameflow a little.

[u]Tips:[/u] 
(*) Don't ever lose sight of the milestones early in the game
(*) Watch out when training staff: a level 2 card will require a salary and if something goes wrong and you don't earn enough money you will immediately lose the trained card (unless you reach the training milestone reducing salaries). Upgrading too many cards too early could be a critical mistake.
(*) Marketing is hugely important in this game. A player dominating marketing could bring havoc to others and huge revenues for himself.
(*) The first few turns are very important. Bring focus as to how you start up your company: small and fast to market and produce a certain type of food/drink and get you the marketing milestones and first burger/pizza produced or errand boy played or a firm in which you train and recruit more staff offering more powerful actions later on and granting more flexibility and milestones related to recruitment and training.
(*) Always watch for what the others are doing and build your strategy around that. Successful strategies depend on the map layout and the way others build up their food chain structures
(*) Price wars can be devestating. Watch out when a player gets the ability to produce a wide range of many products and then drops his prices.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Very intersting and smoothly flowing game which offers plenty of very intersting player interaction. Easy to teach and a reasonable game time compared to the contents offered. It offers different strategies depending on how the city gets put together and what paths opponents chose. It will satisfy heavy games solving the puzzle of efficently building up their company and playing the board correctly, but it will ruin players who lag behind or make the mistake of overshooting themselves too quickly.

At first, I was tempted : pure strategy game, realistic, strong thema... but then, I realized the 2 first turns have to always be the same for all players (we all agreed on the fact and usually set the game such as those 2 turns where 'already played'), then I got quickly bored with the lack of randomness : once you have played it, you can only play it better... it's like reading the same book again and again until you know it so well no one can ever challenge you, especially the newbies.
But, more over : for the price they sell it, an Excel-sheet-look-like game is a real piss off... seriously, there is a slight limit between lack of originality and real couldn't-care-less attitude  : I usually play for fun, which is not easy when the game looks like what I work on daily!

always interested, more now that the deckbuilding is a typo. maybe pool building is there, but its not Dominion for 4 hours at least.

update: Very fun and original mechanisms for doing what one sees everyday when they go to work (if working in such a business). So many options! There is a lot going on here, and like TGZ it has a spacial reckoning as well. 
The cards are takens and added to a pool, but they are always at your disposal, not a random draw. Being able to navigate through all the ins and outs of a business-tier is important of when to train someone to a higher position, especially if they are leaving managment to do so.

The beginner game is a very nice addition, so that those on the fence can have a taste without diving in for 4 hours. The taste is very good as well, but not as hard to stay afloat as the full game, which is quite unforgiving if you don't watch out.

I liked the sound of many of the mechanics, but the game did not work for me at all.  There is a steep learning curve, which is fine.  What's not fine is that when someone starts doing well, other players may get locked out.  A strong engine doesn't just snowball, it also squashes other players.  With 2-4 hour playtime, it's not acceptable to get locked out for a mistake on turn 1 or 2.  It's also definitely a game where winners take longer and longer turns while losers take shorter and shorter turns, so it's quite tedious to be losing.

But I still find elements of the game fascinating....just not in this combination.

RATING: 10
FCM is at the top of the food chain when it comes to unforgiving, brain-burning challenges. This is one of the few games which asks me to directly engage the other players' thinking in a manner somewhat similar to chess: the variable board forms a kind of modern terrain, the information is all available from the outset, and the opponent's thinking is revealed through his/her play. Although obvious the games differ enormously the feel has distinct parallels for me, personally. Can't say enough good things about it. But as with chess, players of differing experience levels will have a tough time having a competitive game. This is one of the greats of modern board gaming!

Dont expect a new player to sit there 2 hours while they have no chance at winning. This game was shit with 2 players don't bother. Dry boring theme, no real catch up mechanism or close scores at the end. Way too many cards that could be easily replaced by a good player boards. $120 too much. Need to try a bigger player count to gauge how it goes.

--Oct2015-- Very interactive, engaging, and fascinating.  There's a lot to consider here: possibly too much for a first game.  But the decisions seem both real and meaningful:  the evidence of my first game is that distinguishing good patterns from bad is vitally important,  and that good play triumphs over bad.

A game that is heavy due to the weight and power of every decision.  Like other Splotter games, this gives you an experience that doesn't feel like it's "on rails" in the way that most other games do.  You must think on your feet and predict the actions of opponents who are doing the same, and the effects of mistakes can be drastic.  This game should be played with players who will be interested, want to win, and are not the sort to get upset about the outcome, as runaway victories and huge swings are very possible.  This is not to say that this game can't be played casually.  However, if the attitudes of the players don't align, it's possible that the presence of a single player who plays to win and is not being "nice" will (even inadvertently) destroy the plans and potentially the experience of another player who is experimenting or playing casually.

Another of the sort of engine-building game I am apprehensive about playing, play badly, and have no interest in studying to get any better at. Luckily, I played with friends and that made the experience fun, despite the game. 

Learning to manipulate a complex, artificial system that purports to simulate something is just something I'm not interested in. The milestone cards for those who first do something, most especially, hinder novices from competing at all with experienced players, and give the appearance (an accurate one from what I have read) that there are really just a few avenues for winning in this game. 

The theme doesn't do much for me either here, although the game's graphic design is spot on for those who enjoy hearkening to 1950s U.S. fast food. Price rough all well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like the graphic design and the theme, the varying economic interplays as players games develop. Scripted first turn choices suggest a bit of a problem with design, but the game really does open up after that, and I guess there's scope for an experienced player to try something different and make it work. Find the number crunching a little bit tiresome, especially as the end draws nearer. Not to be played when tired, and depending on your day job, may bear an uncomfortable similarity to actual work, which again depending on your attitude to that may or may not be fun.

I loved the other Splotter titles I've played, but this one has serious problems.

-Way too long. And doesn't justify it's length with awesome gameplay mechanics. There are some interesting mechanics, yes, but not 4-5 hours worth.

-Way too much upkeep and bookkeeping. This would be a 20-30 minute game on a computer, and that's just annoying.

-I like tight, brutal games, but this one is a BIT too far in that direction, in that a player can get put out of contention in the first 30 minutes or so, and then sit there for 4 and a half hours hating life. Terrible.

played only one intro and one full game but constantly thinking about the game.. so that's a good sign.  Classic Splotter and feels like it combines many nice element from many of their top games to create this neat package.  Rule isn't overly difficult and game play less fiddly than any of their previous game so that's a big plus too.
Update: Over 10plays in and still learning so much about it.  I still haven't used several employees or used effectively..  I played 4 teaching games back to back in one weekend all against different opponents learning it for the first time.  It went down really well and throughly enjoyed every single game of it.. if that doesn't make any game 10 nothing would.

First splotter played.  I am in, 1 2 player with wife and 1 4 player.  I taught 4 player to 2 new players and came in last, but was having a blast.  As described some early mistakes (which I saw quickly were mistakes) set me back.  Had me thinking about the game well after playing.  4 Player game with explanation only took about 3 hours with 600 reserve. 

This could be up there with TTA, but need to get more plays in.

Az Indonesia és az Antiquity után a legmagasabb helyezést elért Splotter játékot is volt alkalmam kipróbálni és ahogy a két eddigi játékukban ebben sem kellett kicsit sem csalódni. A játék teljesen egyedi nem is igazán tudom mihez hasonlítani. Célunk a kezdő kis éttermünket felvirágoztatni, esetleg új üzetlek nyitásával a kisváros hamburger, pizza, és három folyékony nedü igényét kielégíteni. Érdekes módon az igényekkel is nekünk kell foglalkoznunk a játékban, különböző kampányokat kell indítanunk, hogy a lakók érezzék, hogy ezekre nekik szükségük van.  Még a város házainak növelésével is kisérletezhetünk, hogy a mi bevételünk nőjön az új lakók beköltözésével. A tematika itt-ott azért nem tökéletes, mert pl. a pizza és a hamburger a semmiből keletkezik a szakácsaink által, míg az üdítőket a kifutófiún kívül a város lerakataiból szerezzük be. A játék két fő része közül az első a dolgozóink menedzselése. Renteg féle munkásunk lehet, akik fejlődőképesek is és egyre jobb tulajdonságokkal rendelkeznek később, ha képezzük őket. Vezetőként 3 dolgozót tudunk irányítani, de menedzserek segítségével később akár 20-30 főt is vezethetünk egyszerre. Rendkívül jó mechanizmus, hogy minden körben mi döntjük a dolgozóink közül, hogy kik jöjjenek az adott munkanapon dolgozni és ezzel a stratégiai mellett a taktikai is fontos szerepet játszik a társasban. A játék másik fő része a véletlenszerűen létrehozott térkép, amin nagyon fontos az üzletein jól elhelyezkedése, mert vásárlóink minél közelebb szeretnék elfogyasztani az ételeiket és italaikat, így ahhoz mennek, aki közelebb jobb áron árulja ezeket. Vannak mérföldkövek is a játékban, amik tulajdonképpen arra szolgálnak, hogy a teljesen egyforma kezdés után gyorsan különböző stratégiákat adjanak a kezünkben. Aki elsőnek teljesít valamilyen mérföldkövet, az további bónuszt kap. Nagyon ötletes a játék vége feltételének bekövetkezte is. Van egy pénzállomány, amit megszerezve még egyszer bekerül egy adott mennyiségű pénz a játékba, amit a játékosok úgy döntenek el, hogy titokban kiválasztják a 100-200 és 300 dolláros kártyák közül melyiket adják be és ha ez is elfogy váltja ki a játék végét. Abszolút több utas a játék, rendkívül fontos az időzítés. Talán egyetlen dolog nem tetszett benne, hogy van egy olyan mérföldkő, illetve dolgozó (igaz, őt elég nehéz kifejleszteni), ami, illetve aki azt tudja, hogy az adott körös bevételünket 50%-al megnöveli. Kár volt bele ez a runawayleader dolog. A végső ponthoz mindenképpen kell még egy játék, de előzetesen legyen 8-as.

Rating is for a partial play of the game. We played a 2-player introductory game and got the rule for a billboard horribly wrong -- it should affect a house it is touching, not just the tile with a house in it! This made it much easier to generate demand, and led to a lopsided win for my opponent. Despite this, we enjoyed the mechanics, and the planning needed to make anything worthwhile happen, and are going to try it again, now that we know what we are doing.

Not nearly as 'heavy' as everyone keeps saying it is. The actual rules are very simple and intuitive. I know some people have a problem with the art style but in person, I find it charmingly retro and very clear/easy to understand at a glance (the simple retro art style actually helps keep the chaotic table a little less chaotic). It's cut-throat and a bit longer than it could be but it's never not interesting. The board layout and player decisions make each game feel very different and I enjoy exploring all the possible strategies a lot.

Probably my second-favorite Splotter title, just behind Roads and Boats. It's a great economic game, and I love how you're building up your employee hierarchy like a tech track while also drumming up both supply and demand for the marketplace. There seems like lots of ways that you can win this one, and I hope that I can get it to the table from time to time.

1 play, 4er

As usual for Splotter games, the rules themselves are not especially complicated -- it's all in the play. We used a blend of the intro and full games: $75x money in the bank, and with milestones. The intro game starts with $50/player in bank, the full game adds an additional variable amount as per players (secret) choices. The game ends when the bank is empty; the player with the most money wins.

Players start with one restaurant on the randomly constructed board. Each turn, players lay out their cards in an organizational hierarchy, with themselves (CEO) at the top and their employees below them (like a flowchart). You can send some people away on vacation, too. Employees can do a variety of things:
- managers can supervise other employees
- some can hire new people, or train those not currently working to higher-level employees
- improve your ability to collect various types of drinks (from sources on the board)
- cooks produce pizzas or burgers
- alter prices for goods sold
- advertisers create demand, on the NEXT turn, for the goods you produce
- etc.
Turn order adjusts every turn: more nimble companies (with more empty employee slots) go earlier. On your turn, all your employees act. The first player to do various things (e.g., first to place a billboard, first to produce food, first to play a waitress, etc.) gets a Milestone card: a permanent power useful for the rest of the game. Actually, everyone achieving that Milestone during the same game turn gets the benefit -- so you MUST keep an eye on everyone, make sure you are keeping pace.

After everyone has taken their actions, the houses on the board consume goods according to their current demand. They go to the restaurant that has exactly what they want; if multiple, then to the closest and cheapest. Restaurant owners earn for every food/drink sold. Then, everyone pays their employees.

Wow, such a neat game! It is, as usual, pretty unforgiving. There are a lot of gears to turn, and you can't get too far behind or it seems it would be impossible to catch up. I managed to play so poorly that I didn't get ANY milestones until quite late in the game ... DON'T DO THAT! As you'd expect, I was a distant last place. The game feels a bit like Antiquity: choose your own unique power, here based on the Milestones you go after; mostly you're playing on your part of the board doing your own thing, until you realize you can really screw with the other players by building in their direction (dump/pollution in Antiquity, marketing here); turn order manipulation (manned carts going later, vs unfilled employee slots going earlier) can be key at certain points in the game. I think there were similarities with The Great Zimbabwe as well, but I've only played that once (long ago) and don't remember the details.

Very good, tough, economic game!

RATING: 6
This is a game of players competing to have the best fast food joint.  This is a nice, original theme which is what initially attracted me to the game.

The primary game mechanic is based on hiring and working with different types of workers.  Your workers do everything from advertise to cook food to open new restaurants to train your existing workers.  The rest of the game is based on map placement and management to ensure the residents of your sleepy 1950s town buy from your restaurant over your competitors.

This is a reasonably deep game.  There are lots of ways to get business over your opponents.  You can advertise and cook food that they don't, you can lower your prices, you can open restaurants closer to them, etc.  And by managing all these things properly you can even have your opponents do some of the work for you.  For example they can advertise a certain food product and by opening closer and cheaper to that household and making that product you just got the business your opponents worked to make them hungry for.

That's the part I liked the most.  How there were different ways to acquire business and distinguish yourself from the competition.  The rest of the game outside of the fun theme and multiple paths to fast food victory didn't sell me as much.  For one the game is incredibly unforgiving.  One mistake can pretty much hose you for the rest of the game.  At that point you're pretty much hoping your opponents also make a mistake but there's very little way to recover on your own otherwise and that can make for a pretty poor experience playing out the remainder of a 2-3 hour game.

The other thing I hate about games like this is by the final few turns there's not much you can do.  Especially on the final turn there's only a couple workers that will earn you money so you can be left with a handful of employees that do nothing for you.  This makes the end game a lot less interesting.

Finally, I have been very unimpressed with the quality of all the Splotter games.  Their printing is atrocious, with every cardboard chit off-center.  The minimal art design of this particular game might be excused as intentional style but really it just looks cheap and lazy.  This is especially inexcusable when you consider the high asking price for the Splotter titles.  The excuse I always hear when you bring this up about Splotter titles is that you're paying for the quality of the design not the quality of the product.  No!  That's not how it works.  You don't pay for the perceived quality of the design, you pay for the actual product you are buying.  I've never gotten a discount for seeing a shitty movie over an Oscar winner.  And that's even ignoring the fact that as of yet I've been pretty unimpressed with Splotter games.

Thank you to my Spiel Portugal's friends. Gift on my 40th birthday.

Played twice now and still deciding what to think exactly about the game although these two first plays had already given me some clear perspectives on it.

There are some neat ideas or concepts in the game that I like. Same thing happened when I played Great Zimbabue. Overall it's a tough game with a lot going on. Players should really have the same(ish) experience level on the game in order to make it slightly fair to each one.
I don't understand the first decision on what card should we pick with money to add into the bank. If I need a longer game I should go for the higher card, if I need a shorter game I should decide for the lower one. Ok. But how do I know at the start of the game which is the one that I should decide for?

Another thing that bugs me, among a few others that I won't specifically mention, is the Milestone on the 50% plus profit. Even if stupid, I can agree that once you waste your first good (drink or food) you get a fridge. It's something we can argue about, I mean, as a valid reason to award a player for doing so, but fine. Now the goal of the game is to make money. If you're making money it's not something special that you're doing. It's not that you decided to go different from what other players are doing, no! you're playing the game. And you're playing well. Why in the world should the player(s) getting 100$ receive a solid advantage after they already have reached a solid advantage in order to win?! It's the exact opposite of the so called catch up mechanism logic? Should we decide to split the game in two fronts, the others that got the milestone as a premier league for the game and the others as a first division trying not to get last? I am very confused about this.

Lots of accounting, lots of components - this game might be better as a computer game. Also some downtime, potential for AP and very unforgiving. Like many allegedly "completely skill based" games, the game can be decided by one slight miscalculation, or by effects of the other players' agency that are unintentional. Partly because of this, I think it might be a bit grief-y with experienced players.

Enjoyed it on the whole though. Liked the HR deck-building aspects. Would play again 2 player.

Preliminary rating.

Seems like a wonderful evolution of ideas from earlier Splotter titles with some new twists too. Players control competing restaurant chains in a 1950s dystopian hell where the only food options are pizza, burgers and three kinds of beverage. Customers will buy based on a combination of price and distance, with demand dictated by various forms of advertising.

Competition is heavily dictated by turn order constraints, manipulation of price and manipulation of supply and demand; it's also important to build the company, however, and acquiring a burger chef now means deferring an opportunity to get, say, a HR manager for greater efficiency in future hires or a coach for training.

Key to strategy are the "milestones", overpowered bonuses for being the one of the first players to perform a task, such as a permanent +$5/pizza bonus (on a normal base price of $10) for being the first to advertise pizza. In practice, these work a lot like Zimbabwe's gods, but because they aren't so exclusive it's possible to jockey for them -- probably in exchange for passing up some other advantage.

If that sounds like it could lead to scripted play, board variability and player dynamics make that unlikely to have a problem. My only real concerns are about the difficulty keeping track of what other players have, but they're minor. A few plays in, Food Chain Magnate is looking like my game of the year.

Enjoyable!  Fun to get the game off to a good start with the "refrigerator" and "$15 in salaries free" bonuses.  Still a bit of a mystery what constitutes good placements.

Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain. The focus is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system. Players compete on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales, and on a job market for key staff members. The game can be played by 2-5 serious gamers in 2-4 hours.

RATING: 6.3
I don't like the "first to have played" bonus system which clearly unbalances the starting outset. So it's not about building your small burger joint into a fast food chain as I had initially thought, but it's about exploiting card combos and ruining opponent's setups through certain countermeasures.
Not really what I like in an economic game.

Really enjoyed playing the intro game, which is a simplified setup where you don't have milestones and don't pay salaries, which allows one to learn the game. I managed to get a lot wrong initially so did quite badly. It does have one flaw that annoys me in games, in that if you've made a mistake in your planning, you can land up with nothing to do on your turn. This always annoys me as it effectively excludes some one from the game for a period. I need to play again to see if that was just because we didn't really understand how to play yet or whether this might still happen with more experienced players.

RATING: 7.25
Based on a single play. Will most likely change, potentially dramatically.

It is an interesting economic semi-engine building game. There is a lot going on and it is kind of a push and pull between other players doing supply and demand. My problems stem from the fact that the Milestones exist. They seem to almost force decisions in the first few turns and later (especially the $100 one granting a CFO) turn into a run away leader problem. Yes, it is possible to catch up, but getting 50% more money when you're the first to hit $100 is huge.

I think the game just might be better without milestones, although that might limit overall specialization and "first mover" decision making. Maybe some limitation of which milestones are in? Either way, it isn't a bad game, it is just different and overly complex.

Really enjoy some of the mechanisms (like the tech tree / hiring tree) but others (milestone, bank breaking, variable ending, and drink collection paths) seem a bit tacked on. Need to try it again with experienced players to make a full decision though.

EDIT: Have 2 more plays the game has definitely improved. When people know what they are doing the game is much better and more interesting. I question some of the balance choices of the game and the starting few turns feel scripted (due to the bonus "technology" cards you get), but it is still a very interesting title.

This game blows me away. I normally care about the aesthetics and the art in my games quite a bit, but I can barely even give it a second thought when playing this because I'm so immersed in whats happening. I normally stray away from games that are unforgiving of early errors, but this game just feels more thrilling because of it. Even when I'm not playing, I'm thinking about strategies more than any other game I've ever had. Everything that every player does matters to everyone else and it makes the game so very enjoyable from start to finish and makes the game feel much shorter than it actually is.

It's nice to have a heavy game that isn't heavy due to the complexity of the rules. I find it very satisfying to build up my restaurant and play this game as cutthroat as a real businessman would. I've yet to play this game and not thought about it for a long time afterwards. The only major downside is the playtime. I would play this a lot more if it were shorter.

I have the 5th printing preordered, but was able to play this at Dice Tower Con 5.  WOW!  I love this game!

I absolutely love the theme, the artwork has a 1950's vibe to it and fits perfectly.  I personally do not mind the board art, it serves it purpose fine, although a few of the guys I was playing with were complaining about the roads and "neighborhood" art looking very plain.

The game play is complete strategy, with absolutely no luck involved.  As of right now, I will always play this game.  My only concern is that it is such a heavy game, that it won't get as many plays as I would want.  I am anxiously awaiting my preordered copy so that I can get this played with my regular game group.

1/1/2017: I have played this twice so far, and really enjoy both plays. The rules might be a bit overwhelming to take in initially, but once you start playing, it all makes sense. The brilliant part of the game which also provides variability for each play is the "milestone" elements. I really like this game so much and this is the first Splotter game that I played so far. I certainly want to play more of this game to explore the depth of this game.

One thing that I would suggest is to have a print outs of milestone to be used instead of using the cards. There are some files that have been posted on the file section within BGG that you can use for the milestones.

RATING: 10
Wonderful. I don't want to overstate my opinion, but the joy this game brings me is embarrassing. It can be painfully unforgiving and require a bind-bending amount of forethought to play well, but the delight I get out of both the theme and mechanics overcome what otherwise may be a daunting task. Most of all, it's the type of game that invites me to play it again and again: I want to unravel its mysteries and explore its depths. If that sounds overly poetic, I have no defense.

The game's strength is twofold. First, you have to plan your corporate structure out ahead of time. In this way, the game feels very much like a modern Euro. Hiring employees and building up your company feels vaguely like deck-building. While you never have to shuffle your deck, looking for synergistic combinations is a must. That said, comparisons with deck-building games are overstated. [i]When[/i] to hire an employee is just as important as choosing [i]which one[/i] to hire -- and that is very much dependent on not only your own strategy, but those of the other players as well.

For the second, and true strength of FCM is in the player interaction. Having a strategy of your own is important. Left unchecked, a player with a successful strategy can run away with the game, and quickly. But that's the key: you can't let anyone out of your sights. The game demands interaction. Otherwise, the whole thing can snowball out of control. If you don't believe me, try a two-player game against an experienced player. You won't know what you're doing, or how to stop the other person. You'll come away feeling like the game is yet another exercise in discovering and executing the perfect set-piece. But it's just not so! You have to play the second half of the game just as well as the first, and that means learning how to run interference with a vengeance. Plan, and then adapt. It's a tall order, but possible.

However, the game isn't perfect. Despite a bevy of options, there are only one or two opening moves that make sense long-term. Sometimes the random board is a bit lopsided. And of course you can find yourself in a situation where you've made enough mistakes that you're likely out of the running fairly early on. None of these flaws are enough to keep me away from the game. I suppose if you're the type of gamer who demands that all players have a chance of winning from beginning to end, you'll want to avoid FCM (for sure!), but that's not generally something I look for in my game selection.

Finally, what this game needs is a way to manage the ridiculously large footprint it requires in table space. Fans are already coming to the rescue with dry-erase boards and card holders, which I highly recommend. If all else fails, there is a very good online implementation.

If you are a fan of business games with high levels of interaction and room for multiple strategies (none of which can be be easily encapsulated because they are all dependent on the particulars of the board and actions of other players), then FCM is worth the entrance fee.

This rivals Colt Express in terms of theme integration with mechanics, but does it in a much more complex and interesting way. There is so much depth to this game, both in the strategy and the theme. I feel as though every design choice was intricately weighed against the theme to see if it would not only function as a well oiled machine, but also tell a very particular story, and that it does. This game is a work of art. The art portrays a 1950's light slapstick take on the rise of corporate America through franchisation. This is what Monopoly aspired to be, a quirky insight into the pitfalls of capitalism. The game is cutthroat, demanding, selfish - all of the things it's theme encapsulates. The tropes are as clever as they are funny, and as eminent in the gameplay as well.

RATING: 9.4
The most strategic of all gamer's games I have played so far, period. The game plays astonishingly light once the rules are clear. I never played anything like this before. There is almost zero luck, it is extremely interactive (in a harsh way), the old fashioned look fits the ridiculously well integrated theme and I simply LOVE almost everything about it. It feels original and complete, satisfying and emotionally involving. The one complain I have is that I cannot imagine to play this with more than 3 or maybe 4 non-AP-prone players for it could easily take 4-5 hours then.

This is not my type of game. Too long for what it is, needs serious streamlining, early mistakes are too crippling, and it's horrendously overpriced considering the prototype-level components.

I do like a couple of ideas here, though. The milestones are neat and they essentially offer asymmetrical play but with the players deciding which "powers" to go for. And the way you build your deck and play cards is novel. I would like to see a proper game utilize those elements, and maybe add some level of randomness. I'm not usually fond of zero-randomness games like this.

Rating could go down to a 3 because I don't plan to play again, but keeping it higher for now because of the two things I do like.

A deep, highly-rewarding economic game that offers unique round-to-round tableau building as a way to represent daily operations of your food-chain empire. There are an infinite number of paths to take in strategy. And it somehow stays balanced. I really like that the game can blow up and give you a player who springs to the top, essentially breaking the bank. When this happens, the game ends. Which is refreshing from many other economic games that can give you a runaway leader, and drag on for a couple futile rounds. This kind of game is what I love about the hobby. It's brilliant, and well worth the cost of entry.

RATING: 10
What a unique masterpiece of a game. The whole way you recruit people to you fast food business then arrange them them in a structure simultaneously with the other players to carry out your strategy that turn is amazing game design that I can see working in many other games in the future. I love the components though I wish the map board tiles were of better quality and had better artwork. But this is a minor quibble when the game is such a piece of genius. Plays great with two and up. Can't enough of this game will be added many more plays in the near future.

After two games, there's still a lot to take in, but if you like the Splotter school of game design, this will be right up your alley.  I really like how they managed to incorporate so many weird little rules into what appears to be a straightforward structure of events.  At a high level you are hiring/training/cooking/getting paid/paying salary/advertising, and each of these phases are easy enough to understand enough on their own.  Mash these things together, and you have a great Splotter game.

You run a fast food operation, the actions you perform on your turn are the employees in your hierarchy. what makes the game great is that all events and objects on the game are deterministic, nothing happens by chance or without the players initializing it. Very cutthroat.

There's no way I can fairly assess this one after only one play of the "easy game".  I'd definitely like to give this a real go at some point, but my initial feeling was that it is too mean and too expensive for me to buy.

My wife would absolutely love this game right up until someone screwed her over with an advert for something she doesn't have, then she'd never want to play it again.

So it remains a game that "I'll happily play someone else's copy of", that opportunity just hasn't come back around yet.

Very good game! It feels very thematic and I feel very immersed in the fact that I am running a fast food chain. Also stays very true to the time the game takes place during. 

You have to play it with the right crowd that don't mind being able to lose in the very first round and having to play 3-4 hours more. Extremely cutthroat. 

So far I'm a little concerned that price reduction seems to be king. We've seen folks go for lots of waitresses or heavy training and market control, but usually the guy with the lower prices adapts pretty easily and just steals most of the market. Also some milesstones seem very strong and kinda lead openings in a certain way. Still though there are many many options and it's a great well made game!

I don't like this game as a two player as the Guru/Radio strategy seems too strong.  As a 3-5 player game this is an incredible game.  

There should be a lot to delve into, a lot of paths to victory, and a lot of game state analysis. 

It has a tech tree which is always enjoyable.  It has nice tradeoffs.  A great theme, great graphic design, and excellent rules to theme matching.

I'd be surprised if this doesn't end up a 10, and a top 5 game for me.

This game has swings of who is controlling the game, which can cause massive amounts of frustration and hopelessness.  I tend to enjoy games that do this.  Other games I have felt "hopeless" is Tigris and Euphrates and Innovation.  Obviously, this is longer, more complicated, and shares no similar mechanics with the aforementioned.  It's just a similar feel when I'm losing.

This game really forces you to to pay close attention to the other players moves and potential moves because of these big swings.  This game has really made me notice how middle weight euro's tend to start out forcing you to pay attention to other players, but by the midgame you are locked into a strategy and there is too much inertia to do too much to other players plans without completely abandoning yours.  Food Chain Magnate is not like that (sometimes, the games can vary from session to session), which can make a session filled with frustration because it is filled with "I really should have seen that coming" moments.  Familiarity with game states and understanding the timing of the end game is critical.

There is a lot to love here.

RATING: 7
I've been interested in this game since the get-go. It's the latest Splotter game which immediately catches my eye. The theme and artwork was also very appealing to me. And the more I learned about how it played the more intrigued I was.

There are essentially two parts to the game. The first is a competition to advertise and sell fast food. There's a fierce competition to create demand on the map and then be the guy who can fill that demand. There's lots of ways to compete in that race, from advertising food, making food, competitively pricing food, moving/creating new restaurants to be closer to customers, developing new houses that might want your food, etc. This is the part of the game that really bends the brain.

The other half of the game and how you do all your stuff is related to your org chart. You hire, train and put to work all sorts of employees who do lots of different things. Every round you select the staff that will work that turn and they do their stuff.

The game starts with players selecting how much money will be put into the bank when it runs out of money the first time. This determines the length of the game. After the bank breaks, the new money comes in and the second time the bank breaks is the end of the game. You won't know how long the game will be until the reserve funds are revealed, so your strategy might not work with the game length.

Their are a ton of milestones, mostly for doing X first, where X could be one of a multitude of things. These usually give you some super cool bonus power that only you (or anyone who achieved it the same round as you) can do. This is a huge part of crafting your strategy in the game.

The game is tricky. You can be doing horribly, but manage to pull off a cool combo and suddenly surge into the lead. Or you can be set to have a great turn, but then have another player suddenly pull the rug out from under you by changing customer demand... or suddenly being able to serve your customers in your place. The opportunity to make big plays is potent, so planning ahead and having a massive plan come to fruition is potentially game-winning. I felt like there was a massive depth to the game that I couldn't begin to scratch. It's going to take several plays before I know how to navigate this game.

About [thing=175914][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=175914][/thing] is an economic game of building a company in order to gain money by serving food and beverages to the people of the town. It is a game that requires players to make an engine capable of attending the needs of the people and creating them, using for this several workers.

The rules aren't all that hard to understand, but the game offers a lot to think about, going from positioning in the market, to hiring, training and putting the employees to work.

Once the few akward first steps are taken, the flow is smooth and everything connects well. All was left to worry the players is fierce competition in an overcrowded market, and all the paths [thing=175914][/thing] offers in order for you to became one.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There is a lot to be said, so I won't. A really simplistic summary is: you will build a company. For this you start by hiring and training people. As a CEO you can oversee up to 3 workers. In order for your company to grow, it will be required more mid-level management, VPs and others - these can oversee more workers, making your company larger and more able to deal with several aspects of the food market: preparing food, buying supplies, marketing, developing new business, opening new venues and so on. And, especially early in the game, there will be competition for the milestones: the first to do some things (like the first to make a pizza "the original!", or to market a soda, or to put a waitress to work, and several others) will gain a nice bonus from that point on, and they can make a huge difference.

Players can only put to work as many people as they have "open slots" considering the amount of people the managers can handle. Each of them will activate during the player's turn, in the order chosen by the player. To train employees, they must be left out of the round (not used).

With the marketing campaings (that can be done by billboards, mail, airplanes and radio), the people of the town will start to want things - pizza, burguers, soda, lemonade and beers. Once they want something, they will go to the restaurant that can fulfill their need, no matter the distance, but they must be able to go there using the roads. Now, if two or more restaurants have what they want, then they will go to the cheapest, even this one is further away, but the price different drops 1 for every tile the family must travel, so they might decide to go with the costier just because is so much closer.

A family (household) can want more than one single thing, like burguer and lemonade. And will only go to a place that can fulfill all its needs or it will stay in the house and eat mac 'n cheese.

Players gain money by selling stuff (standard price: $10 per item), but the value can change due to milestones, princing managers, discount managers and luxuries managers. After dinner time phase (the selling phase) it is payday, and each worker that has a money icon on it must be paid $5 - it is possible to layoff people that you don't want to pay or can't.

Then the marketing campaigns, started earlier, affect the houses in their area of effect. After this, there is the clean up phase, when all the workers are returned to the players hands and the next round will begin.

The game proceeds like this until the money in the bank ends for a second time. The player with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Where to even start? There are loads of decisions made every turn and round. Going from work placement (using the employees) to positioning billboards around the city and what try to sell using them. To make it easy, there are four main and constant decisions to be made throughout to play:
a) Who to hire;
b) Who to train;
c) Who to put to work;
d) What to sell and at what price.

This may seem simple and it is, to understand, at least. Is a normal chain of business and everyone gets it. Still [thing=175914][/thing] gives a big set of choices within the choices - for instance, there are 32 differents workers! Plus considerations about slots to put workers, how to cut the competion, the best way to use the marketing, how to reach more households, to sell more, etc.

It is a very rich game regarding decisions to be made. And is all open to the players - there is no luck, events, surprises - except, of course, those made by the other players, which can sting much more.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Almost complete control by the players - highly strategic (As advertised: 100% dice free);
- So many paths to follow it reminds a food court;
- The allocation of the workers in a organizational chart is simple, effective and thematic;
- Great level of interaction between players;
- Random arrangement board ensure an even higher replay value;
- The graphic design for the cards and player aid are superb.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Steep learning curve;
- Significant downtime, as players do all their actions in the Working phase one at a time, and considering that is in this phase most of the decisions are made, lots of time can be spent waiting;
- No catch up mechanism - if you lag behind, you will be close within the year.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
I'm in the food industry - with two partners I own a food truck. It is a small business, but several of the challenges faced in the game are the same we have: marketing to customers in strategic ways, pricing accordingly to the competition, and meeting demands. It emulates this challenging business smoothly and with some neat choices.

In [thing=175914][/thing], while you run from the macro point of view, there are parts of the business you won't have to deal with: no suppliers chain to negotiate and deal with; no concerns about safe work environment or legislation; no worries about standards or quality of ingredients, nor health issues; and I could go on. [thing=175914][/thing] isn't a simulation of the business. Is an economic game, that uses some extracts of the industry to create a frame to fill with theme and mechanics. And it did just that, and very well.

[thing=175914][/thing] is a heavy game, but most definitely not a dry one. It is filled with choices, competition and colors. The graphic design ties everything together and the mechanics, after some rounds, went into "shadow mode": you are playing, and not worrying about rules - you just want to sell some burguers and soda, godammit!, but those bastards of the Xango Blues Bar keep cutting your business with its waitresses and working almost at a loss, until they run you to the ground. Maybe its time to go to new regions, investing in regional manager and finding some houses with gardens to attend to. Notice? Players think in "real" names and options, not in rounds, phases, icons, etc.

Therefore, [thing=175914][/thing] goes very well recommended for those wanting a well done, heavy and complex game, with lots of heart, put in a not small playing time (around 3hrs). Not for everyone tastes, sure, but our brand director is working to make you hungry.

one of the best euro of 2016 season in multiplayer category. Heavy, unforgiving, cruel, real business simulator. I had doubts about boring theme but when I gave it a chance it blew up my mind. The whole week I was immersed in thoughts about strategies, counter strategies, tactics, precise timing. Authors made a fantastic job creating the whole system that works simply brilliant. Probably only 2 cards are not essential and rarely used. I put this game in my top5 of all times.
Minor negatives why 9.5:
- uses too much space on the table. Milestones could use more compact solution than cards (use great idea of insert from BGG user to fit on one table)
- slippery paper money. You have to double count
- unequal size of map tiles (small issue)
- extremely pricey for components inside. Ok, for a good game you have to pay corresponding money :)
At the end: Respect to designers for the compact box. No air selling what is rare these days

This is a purely subjective rating. Managing the barrage of cutthroat, negative player actions just is not for me. I already disliked this in Cyclades and Kehmet, but they are childs' play compared to FCM. It's all just so much "in your face". The achievements in the early game make the first turns feel scripted (with everybody going for them), but at the same time like you are building up a disadvantage that is hard to recover from. Still, I can see how there is a solid design in there that some players may enjoy.

After two plays this is one of my favourite new games. It's unique in terms of the theme and the mechanic of building up your corporate structure every turn.

This is a game that's great if you're in the lead or close to to the lead. If you're not, you have no chance at all of coming back, and can be painful to sit through while the others battle it out.

Definitely has some really neat and innovative ideas and despite a rather lengthy rule book and complex rules, it's very intuitive. Almost no rule consults are needed after someone learns how to play.

Components are sub par.

Do not play with 2. 3+ is good.

Central mechanic of cardplay is quite engaging - lots of reasonable options with tough decisions.  The boardplay works but is on the weak side; it actually feels overly randomized such that there will often be worthless areas and newbie traps for placement.  Turn order is also somewhat awkward, with it taking up a decent chunk of game time for something that is a clear choice 80% of the time.

Overall I'd say it is overly complicated, but I still enjoyed playing it.  The negatives don't weigh it down too heavily, and it remains engaging for most of the game (though can get a bit lame ducky at the end couple of turns).  It's a bit long but not horribly so - 2ish hours with my level of AP on a first play is reasonable.  (Though I did play online - I could see it being a bit of a management nightmare in person.)

Very interesting.  Love the spatial element and how highly interactive it is, you have to be watching everything that your opponents are doing so you can continually try to keep a step ahead of them, or at least not far behind.  Interesting with the race to bonuses, though the balance feels off on them.  Still, can't help but feel like the game is a bit unfinished overall.  I wonder about possible imbalances, hard to stop runaway leaders, component quality is lacking, and I wish some of the mechanisms made a bit more sense realistically.

After one play of the introductory game, I'm chomping at the bit to try this one again. More Splotter awesomeness. I am concerned that the full game might be too adversarial for my partner, however. When we play R&B, we avoid conflict, but it seems likely unavoidable in FCM.

As far as cutthroat economic games go this is the best one I have played. Surprisingly simple rules. Multiple paths to victory and fierce competition using all means necessary to undermine competition and grab the market. Add the need to maneuver your position in turn order and always planning one round ahead. Simply superb but one could lose a friend or two in this game :D

Only one play, but very very good after that one play.  I went to bed thinking about this one, and woke up thinking about it.  After 15+ years of playing these games, that almost never happens anymore.  The opening strategy is very rich, and choices develop well from there.  Comonents are better than the run-of-the-mill Splotter title, which also helps.  The advertising creating the demand is a wonderfully intuitive way of creating chaos that is manageable by good play.  This game is as much about planning for all eventualities as it is about min-maxing a particular strategy. Really looking forward to more plays to see if this holds up.

The most interactive engine-building game you'll ever play- you must constantly keep an eye on what your opponents can do lest your plans get flushed down the proverbial toilet. The modular board truly makes every game different!

I'm not sure if the tiny Splotter print runs will hold it back, but this game is an easy top 100 candidate if it manages to get any kind of circulation. It has the usual spartan graphics found in most Splotters, but the retro 50's theme of the game makes it a feature that feels completely appropriate. Gameplay is as deep as any other of the legendary Splotter releases I've played, but this one is much easier to slide into because of its unique deck-building/action selection system.

Basically, you draft a few cards every turn (which represent employees) and then play them in future turns to execute actions on the main board. These employees perform a wide range of actions in supplying, advertising and managing your business. You are limited on any given turn by how many executives you have on the payroll. The more supervisors you have, the more workers you can utilize. Of course those supervisors don't do much to advance the business on their own, so while you are training them up it is almost impossible to make sales on the main board. Stay small and you can generate fast profits serving whatever the local neighborhoods want. The trade-off for staying small is that you will never have the manpower to expand into new markets or create new ones.

Figuring out how to outmaneuver your competition is an absolutely fascinating puzzle. Sell cheap? Offer a full service wait staff? Ad-bomb a neighborhood and turn them onto a completely new offering? Every one of these can be effective and every one can be countered by a savvy opponent. Yet the game never gets complicated. The actions are very straightforward with minimal rules overhead. The game also has a nice strategic arc. Early turns are simple and easy to plan, with each newer turn growing a little more intense. As the game turns the corner into the final rounds, it becomes an agonizing chess match trying to lure customers away from your opponent's establishments. Just when your organization is on the verge of becoming to large to handle, the game ends. It's damn near a perfect play length.

RATING: 3
This is the most fiddly game I've ever played, if anyone calls Sentinels Of The Multiverse fiddly again I will hit them in the head with this game's box as many times as the furthest diner's price + distance would be to house number 15 if the house has gardens and there is a discount manager at work but also a luxury manager but no counting the bonus from that milestone you got last turn. So as you see the way you have to count distance on a weird map and add prices which have modifiers to it to determine where people go ... for every single house is tiring as hell. It also makes the game either unplannable or headhurtingly AP-prone
The tech tree is the interesting part of the game but that takes up insane ammount of table space and is again fiddly as hell. What really makes me dislike this game though is how advertising works. In a game this detailed the fact that your ads don't sell your products at all, they just generate demand for a type of stuff anyone can fulfill ... which not only is unthematic for me, but from a pure mechanism standpoint it is a hotbed of kingmaking. For example I got most of my points because someone mistakenly (because - again - it would be a chore to count distances and shit) advertised in a way that was good for me and not for him. That is not elegant design at all. I kind of understand why this "do whatever" kind of sandbox is appealing to people but for me it's neither good design nor a good experience.

One of the most demanding and unforgiving games I've ever played. And although there are some things about it that I'm not particularly fond of (e.g. it can suffer from runaway leader problem), overall this is an amazing design. There's absolutely zero luck here, everything depends purely on your strategy. I love the tight competition over the customers and the complex decision-making. Obviously it's not a perfect economic simulation, but the HR and marketing aspects are handled extremely well. This game just oozes theme! I love it.

The retro-look of the game is fantastic. Some might find it to be too simplistic (to the point of being prototype-like), but I think that the graphic design just fits the theme perfectly.

Blige. There aint't a lot of luck in this game. Mechanics are simple but the brain workout is somewhat harder.  Some may be turned off by the plain artwork however it is just right, anything more will make it too busy for the brain to cope with.  After only a couple of  games we are not even scratching the strategy surface, looking at it through one eye is about as much as we are doing.  The more you play the more you see and the more you want to talk about it.  True, it needs a big table, if you haven't got one get one! The designers are nothing short of genius. Makes my heart beat faster just thinking about it. Pure adulterated genius.

I haven't played a "full" game of this yet, but the more I play it, the more I like it. In the game, you're building org charts, producing marketing campaigns (to drive demand of goods), and then satisfying demand (to make money).

This was the first game where we paid salaries and used reserve cards, before I had only played short games. However, we still didn't play with milestones yet and I'm glad we left them out for now. In this game, it felt a bit one sided as I managed to get a lot of the good one-of cards and used them to really push into the lead.

Tentatively recommended, and even if I had a few games under my belt, this isn't for everyone.

Odd and heavy card driven euro on a modular city board to grow your fast food empire in the city. Build your org chart of hired personnel cards with special abilities from trainees, short order cooks, truck drivers, marketing staff, recruiting personnel. Those not on the job are at the beach. Meanwhile, you are running a multi-media advertising campaign to generate demand for your menu from planes, mailboxes, radio, & billboards. Produce the food to meet the campaign driven demand depending on the different range logistics of the ad programs. Customers are also price and distance sensitive. Any wasted food goes to the freezer or thrown out. Make payroll, move restaurants to better locations, new houses of demand pop up here and there... Woof. A lot going on. Retro '50's themed game look and feel. Love these guys and there game niche is so unique in theme and mechanics...but... I have trouble grasping and explaining these games, so I don't get them to the table often enough. Mad respect though. A cutthroat longish game involving many systems where everyone's strategy is played out in the open to be the first to trigger the victory condition by breaking the bank for mad stacks of cash yo.

This is a cut-throat business game; you will cook,market and sell food items to homes on a map. You will need to recruit from a wide variety of potential employees, mostly cooking staff, marketing staff and management/HR staff. You will also want to develop the city board by placing advertisements, building new restaurants and commissioning new homes to be built.  You may find a niche in the market and make a ton of money by raising prices, or you might get undercut by an opponent and make nothing.  This is not a game for playing nice.

One play of the basic game without salaries or milestones.  There's not a lot of game there in the basic game, but all I can see the full game adding is struggle and length.  I don't think I'll play it again.

Edit:  OK.  I was wrong about the full game. Salaries are manageable in a variety of ways, and, instead of just adding length, the milestones give some nice perks and also shape each player's strategy.  The game is still a bit overwhelming in its openness and it's hard to tell if what you're doing is leading to victory (like many Splotter games), but I see some goodness here and I'd play again.

Theme/Art:
The theme is great, running a fast food chain is pretty unique and fun. The art is not the best I have ever seen (the map looks pretty bland and boring), but the card designs fit the theme well.

Production quality:
Very solid. The game consists of a lot of cards (which feel nice), cardboard tiles and tokens, and wooden resources.

Replayability:
The map is set up randomly, which makes every game different. The secret bank cards determine the length of the game, and you can go for quite a few strategies with the amount of different employees and milestones.

Depth/Difficulty:
It's not a difficult game, it's actually quite easy and straight forward, but you have to know what you are doing and keep track of your components and adapt to their plays.
I weight it 4/5

Strategy:
You need to know what you are doing, what you are going for, and how you will prevent your opponents from interfering with your plans. I also strongly advise that you play with people of equal skill, because this game is VERY unforgiving. If nobody knows what they are doing it should be fine, if everybody knows the game, it should also be fine, but if one knows if and the others don't there is no way they can win, because at first you don't realise how important milestones are and how quickly you can change where all the people on the map eat.

Luck:
Basically none, aside from the randomly generated map.


Food Chain Magnate takes about 1 hour per player and is an absolutely fantastic game. I love how you have to create your own market by advertising goods, only to find out another player sells the same for a lower price and you are unable to sell your burgers.

This game is good enough to warrant the reputation it's built. I liken it a bit to The Gallerist -- both of them are quite easy to actually play, but to play them WELL is a whole different story. I love the little wooden bits here (and there are a lot of them!). The player menus were a great idea, and they're super useful. Each phase is laid out step by step on the front, all the employee types in the middle, and all the milestones and marketing info on the back. Thematically, all the employee types make sense except for one (why would a zeppelin pilot be able to pick up drinks?!) and that's awesome - it really feels like you're building a company.  For downsides, #1 is paper money. I HATE paper money.  #2, even though there are lots of employee cards, I feel like there's going to be a "strategy to rule them all" in the beginning, and each game won't start to feel differently until strategies diverge a bit after most of the milestones are gone. This has been true in all my plays so far -- it might be group think, but a little research reveals the same ideas.

Excellent heavy euro.  The blend of mechanics and theme is seamless and superb.  The intricacies of how the mechanics play out is fascinating.  You make your play, and then the game mechanics take over and you watch (somewhat helplessly) as events play out.  Very tense.  You really have to be foresightful to even stay afloat in this game, much less command a lead.  This and the tension of what will happen due to the players actions that turn make the game extremely engaging.

RATING: 8
Main game mechanics are fabulous and extremely thematic, e.g. the hiring, the corporate structure, the choices consumers make, the price cutting etc. Player interaction is high, though mostly indirect. 

The choosing of bank reserve cards at the start of the game seems odd as the game requires players to adapt to one another's actions from turn to turn. There is a lot of mental calculation required when considering the state of the board and this leads to substantial downtime. More calculations are required during resolution of dinnertime, which bogs down the game. There are no catch-up mechanisms, so once a player is behind, it is difficult to recover. Some time is also required at the start of the game for the tension to build up.

Most of the artwork are nice, but those of the main board and the advertising boards are rather plain. Downtime can be long, particularly in the initial games and with more players. Game component quality is above average.

Got excited by this one at first but it is an intimidating beast of a game. It feels a bit like work when playing this one, I started with a high rating but I'm not sure if I want to play this all that much.

I'm staring to get back into this game, still not 100% au fait with the rules let alone seeing through the strategies but getting there.

After 5 plays I've settled into really enjoying this game, I'd play this any time, win or lose I always find Food Chain Magnate entertaining.

Wow is this game good.  Of all the games I have played, this does the most with the least.  The rules are pretty simple and straight forward (minus some translation ambiguity that is easy amended by reading the forums and errata), but this game hard to actually play well.

The game can be brutal if you mess up and small miscues in your short-term tactical or long term strategy will be costly.

But man, is it fun to play around with.  Such an open, nonlinear game that allows you to execute many different types of strategies... it's really a rare game that allows you this much flexibility to explore and discover each play (and be ruthless to your opponents!)

Hay juegos que los miras y te devuelven la mirada, y ya sabes que tienes que comprarlos. Food Chain Magnate es uno de ellos. Un vistazo a la portada ya te dice que lo que guarda en su interior va a ser muy especial. 

¿Quién no ha querido alguna vez ponerse esa horrible gorra de vendedor de hamburguesas y lanzarse al mercado medrando en el mundo de las cadenas de comida rápida? Los meeples de refrescos tienen la forma de las "Nuka-Kolas" al más puro estilo Fallout, los personajes que pululan por las ilustraciones llevan esa acartonada alegría preholocausto nuclear tan típicamente americana, incluso existen recompensas en la línea de los Beneficios del videojuego.

 Aquí no se trata de matar mutantes sino de hacerse con el corazón de los clientes, creciendo sin medida y amasando cantidades ingentes de pasta - de pizza y dinero -. Si aderezas las partidas con algo de jazz la experiencia ya será sublime, y si es sacada de tu Pip-Boy 3000 mejor que mejor.

Just as punishing to bad starts as people say. But I do love this game. It was fun to sit there and try to out think your opponent every turn. After the first few turns each person starts to develop their own spin on their corporation. Having a late turn order is definitely a must for being able to keep pace and out perform your competitors.

Purchased after watching the full play-through by Heavy Cardboard, reading the (mostly) stellar reviews, and finding out that there was one last copy at [url=http://www.milsims.com.au/]Milsims[/url].

[b]1st play, 3p[/b]:

Spoiler: It really lived up to the hype. While there are some fiddly rules to remember, it isn't a particularly difficult game to learn, but I suspect it will take you some plays to find out what to focus on during the early (answer: milestones!), mid and late game. There is also a lot of potential for player aggression through the form of manipulating demand and by placing new restaurants, forcing others to balance price and supply to overcome those hurdles. The org chart (a different take on action selection I suppose) is a mechanic I'd love to see in future games.

Initial rating: [b]8.5[/b]

[b]Bonus[/b]: Here's a couple of things we did wrong:

1) "Cards reporting to a manager can only be normal employees, not other managers." We actually ended up with a huge tech tree.
2) [after the bank breaks for the first time] "Whichever number occurs most determines the number of slots all CEO’s will have from the next turn onwards."
3) "... if you have a radio campaign running in phase 6: place 2 goods of the type advertised..."

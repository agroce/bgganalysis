GAME: Pax Pamir
RANK: 1036

RATING: 8
I can see where it riffs on Porfiriana in the design, but I find it is more stable in terms of achieving a win, and victories are less likely to just sort of hit you out of left field. Second, the card design follows a defined system and figuring out what others have at a glance is much easier. The last stand out thing is that this is fundamentally different in terms of action utilization than it was in Porf which was more building stuff in your tableau than ability building (through actions available on cards and the current regime). The momentum that the game carries in terms of having two actions per turn and a limited hand/tableau size means you have to spend excessive time in collusion to stop someone, but outside of that, the game just sort of ends (as Porf does). Compared this to Porf where you are more likely to be able to stop someone, but the chance of a surprise victory is greater; Porf swings around faster being my main point. At a deeper level, I find Pamir (and an even greater degree, Ren) to be focused on board state instead of hand based gotcha/shenanigans as Porf is. Pamir bridges both of it's chronologically released siblings in that pulling up the tableau allows you to subtly shift where you're going to reinforce things and "re-deploy."

Downside is, the calculation for the Topple rules is really tough to internalize and convoluted for some reason. It's look at the regime, then board (to determine which influence is to be counted and whether players are even eligible), then influence and figuring out when people can win and when someone else buying the topple to nerf it is cumbersome at best... Porf had half of the effort; straight influence based on regime. In Porf (assuming you knew what people had in their hands), you could quickly do the calculation as to who was going to win once you knew what to look for. I don't have that ease with Pamir.

The nation-building rules are interesting in that it does mean the game is going to go longer, but also that jumping ship off of your current loyalty seems less harmful (e.g. Russians win the first, British win the second, so you jump ship to the British to take your Russian VPs and go for the win on the third topple). I think in some ways that saves lower player counts, and in others, I find it reduces the critical tension surrounding keeping folks in check and that was always such a great thing about the Pax series to me. I'm not sure how this would actually function at 2p; just jump ship to your opponent's loyalty after each topple and work on them that way which is very different from higher counts and Porf/Ren in feel. I'd be interested to try it I guess.

Speaking of player counts, where as I find Porf to easily be premium at 3p, this leaves something to be desired at 3, and takes too long for what it is at 5. That said, I find it a more interesting game than Porf, even at the expense of being a more complex game in practice... I see this ultimately settling out at a high 7, low 8, *especially* without the nation building rules which I'm not really a fan of.

Clean and clear, the iconography and flavour combine well on the cards. The card 'map' is a bit naff, however, I appreciate how Sierra Madre Games focus on keeping costs low in doing this (and would definitely buy the board if I had a group really into this and Pax Porfiriana). As a tableau game it takes up a lot of space on the table and really should be seen as a board game rather than a card game due to the importance of a few spatial concepts. 

There is a lot of complexity here between the closed economy (great! no snowballing), understanding Regime changes and Topples, influence and the various interactions between subtypes of cards. You will need to have a player who understands the flow of the turns, and the flow of the game, to really appreciate how the mechanisms interlock. Expect a messy first game. 

I think this is definitely a 4-5 player game, but it might be the best of the 'shifting loyalties' games - I include Dead of Winter and A Study in Emerald - I've tried so far. In some ways, it's the multiplayer Twilight Struggle I wanted! This is because you need the push-and-pull of influence within Empires and the threat of changing alliances to represent the theme. As a 2-3 player game the mechanisms work but the dynamic loses tension and intrigue. 

At this stage, 6 with 2-3 players, 8 with 4-5

I had imagined that Pax Pamir would only be Pax Porfiriana in an Afghan coat.  It is rather more interesting than that.  Chief among the changes is the introduction of a much more significant geographic element.  The success of a topple is measured by the presence of troops, roads and loyal tribes on the map (plus loyal spies elsewhere).  Those things may all be eliminated in military campaigns, an action that many cards offer.  

The cards themselves are less cluttered with information and benefit from the use of large, clear icons.  I am slightly ambivalent about this as the clutter in Porfiriana provided great thematic flavour and greater variation in card abilities than is evident in Pamir.  

Pamir's economy is very different also. Money is almost a zero sum game, with a drip feed of new currency coming only when certain cards are played.  I like this, it gives Pamir a quite distinctive focus on boots on the ground and espionage.

On early acquaintance, Pamir is less of a wild chaotic ride than Porfiriana, it's narrative isn't as strong, and yet it may very well be a better game.

Production quality is good and the artwork is pleasing.  As usual from Sierra Madre, the rules are a mess.

Probably a good game in here, but my one play just seemed like hard work, I didn't really know what I was aiming for or how to get there. The rules aren't hard I just couldn't get my head around what to do. I also don't really like this kind of 'sudden death' multi-player game.

RATING: 5
An admirably complex, card-driven scrum with cubes and factions depicting, it seems, a power struggle for Afghanistan.  I did not feel invested in the theme or the mechanics of the game enough to feel that the game was fun.  Moving cubes around from card to card, to spy, or assassinate?  Not particularly exciting.  Building roads and fighting for cities?  Zzzzzzzz.

My general distaste for the theme and the mechanics of the game was amplified by a sense that in our four player game, the two players who began the game working for the same faction, had a decided and predictable advantage when it came to winning the game.  The other two players, playing for the second and third factions, perhaps must then form an alliance of convenience to prevent the other two from dominating the ability to win the game.  Still the odds definitely favor the two playing for the same faction; one of these two players is much more likely to win the game.

And yes, games which start with such asymmetries (regarding odds of winning the game) are quite common, and readily acceptable, with respect to war games. But since I am no longer an avid war gamer, the starting asymmetry in this game actually felt like an annoying game design flaw, which is essentially to say, non-war gamers are likely to find this aspect of this game annoying.  

And yes, I know, it's not a flaw, it's a war game!  It's that way by design!  It's hard to win when you start as.........that is why it's so much fun trying, etc.  For me, that's zzzzzz.  It is likely hard to win chess when you start the game without your knights, so I should try the game this way, and enjoy it?

A little bit less arcane than Porforiana, and every bit as bitey. The empire mechanisms mean that you do have some temporary bedfellows, so the early game is a little less brutal. Really dig it.

Longest playing of the pax games and least chaotic this still packs a compelling punch and I want to play it a lot more.  With 2 it doesnt seem to work well, topples are too easy (very hard to defend against) but with more it is amazing.  Rules wise this is possibly the lightest but I think most people will grasp a bit more of what they are doing with Porfiriana.

Need to play more, but my initial impressions are that this game really doesn't work for less than 4 players. With 2 players the map felt too open, getting the majority of influence was too easy, and there wasn't much tension at all. Maybe more plays will help me see more strategy, but right now I don't feel that this comes anywhere near Pax Porfiriana as a 2 player experience.

I cannot recall a game I understand so little after six plays.  Will I play it again?  Yes.  Have I any idea what lesson the designer is trying to teach?  No.

I hear that the theme is political "chaos."  Politics are inherently chaotic; the opportunity in gaming is to understand why past leaders made the decisions that they did.  I have little idea what factors were driving the decision-making of Afghan political leaders circa 1850.

Compared to the glorious mess of Pax Porfiriana, this seemed like a lot cleaner design. First impressions though is that it's also less engaging and it fell a bit flat, despite the subject matter being much more interesting for me, though perhaps partly due to high expectations.

RATING: 9
Re: player count, I now have some experience with different numbers, and I think unlike Porfiriana, Pamir really wants 5 players or as close as possible. Fewer works fine, but 5 is the most interesting game I think.
---
After 3 plays, I'm finally petty comfortable with this one and enjoy it. I don't think it's quite as compelling or narratively interesting as Pax Porfiriana, but it's got a lot going on and it has the nice mix of a lot of chaos with a lot of control; you can plan and plot but have to cope with a chaotic situation, same as the earlier game. I think the military/area control game isn't quite as interesting as one might hope, it adds a bit of whack-the-leader but it's not too bad, and unlike the COIN games, it's possible to play out a power play and actually win on an early topple  card. I like how failed topples lead to power vacuums and mini-resets.

It still has a bit of persnickety complexity to it, but it's not too bad, on par with Pax Porfiriana.

I'm still trying to figure out where the sweet spot is, player-count-wise. Porfiriana plays really well at lower player counts, 3 or 4, and 3 may in fact be best. Pamir seems to want more because of the 3 different empires involved; but maybe not. I really want to try it with 3 to see how it works. The pacing with 5 players is not great, it can be a little slow especially when a topple shows up and people start doing math and figuring control under various configurations. It's not terrible, but the quick pace of 3 player Porfiriana is pretty appealing so it would be nice if Pamir worked at small player counts also.

For me, Pax Pamir fits into the same niche as GMT's COIN games, but I like Pamir much better - the asymmetry is much cleaner, rules and strategies are more comprehensible, the game is more playable, and it's much more realistic.
---
Played twice, and still don't feel that qualified to rate, which is interesting. Less rules-y than Porfiriana, but more complex, intricate, and directly confrontational. It also feels, interestingly, like you have a bit less control. But it plays faster. Not quite sure what to make of it.

It also doesn't help that the setting is a bit more obscure; people (in the US anyway) know stuff about the Mexican Revolution, if only enough to just get oriented. The Afghanistan setting is much more foreign. Although the texture of warlordism and competing great power interests are familiar in their echoes through modern times, the details are different enough to be disorienting.

Although Pamir is quite interesting and I've enjoyed it, I don't think it captures the same magic as Porfiriana.

There has been some debate about the ideal number of players. I've become pretty convinced it's 5. Porfiriana I like with smaller numbers (3-4), but in Pamir I think with the 3 different factions that need backing, and with some odd asymmetries developing at 3 and 4, I really think you want 5 players. This comes with its own hazards of course - downtime, length, and making it much tougher to make a power play to win - but I do think you want the max for the game to work the best. If you have 3, just play Porfiriana.

RATING: 7
If you've been intimidated by other Sierra Madre games due to their very heavy and complicated nature, this is a good one to try out, as it still has all the theme and historical detail while remaining fairly accessible (at least for a Sierra Madre game).

In Pax Pamir, you'll pledge your allegiance to one of three nations, and then work to position that nation to win the game while having the greatest allegiance to it. You'll send out spies, build infrastructure, tax the other players, shift your allegiance at opportune times, etc, all to try to sway the game in your favor.

If you're a fan of getting to build up a bunch of stuff for yourself and admiring what an awesome job you did, this game will likely be frustrating. You're always messing with other peoples' plans, and they're returning the favor, so you can't get too attached to anything you do. However, if you want a good, fairly cutthroat game of tactics and seizing opportunities, this is a good one.

RATING: 4
I'm sure some will say that the game requires repeated play to see how awesome it is, but I am unlikely to give it those repeated plays. This games iconography is all too much, with many many moving parts, all in an effort to solve a puzzle (how to win a topple). The strategy seemed fairly obvious (crabs in a bucket), which really just meant the game felt like a Rosewater puzzle once the Topple cards revealed themselves.

I played with 3 players. We all kind of settled into a faction and then stayed there until someone won. I suspect (due to the pigeon hole principle) that the game would be more fun with 4, however, friends have told me that 5 is painfully long, which makes me nervous about 4 (3 already felt long).

It does look really cute in its little box though.

Mechanically, this is more akin to Renaissance than Porfiriana. Money is agonizingly tight and handled in an interesting way -- new money is very rarely injected in the game and very rarely leaves circulation either. Like PaxRen, your growing tableau gives you access to additional actions printed on cards, but there are a variety of reasons why you cannot perform a PaxRen style long chain of card activations under most circumstances.

Like the other games in the Pax series, the core rules of the game are straightforward and the game moves at a tidy clip when you've had the rules explained to you. But the learning curve is murderous. After a couple of initial attempts, my first impression is that the game is designed to frustrate and punish you if you play with little strategic look-ahead, more so than either Porfiriana or Renaissance. With 6 or 7 games under the belt the game might feel a little less like having my nuts repeatedly slammed in a drawer, but I want to stress that I basically mean that in a good way.

I think I like this one a little less than PaxRen or PaxPorf, but only a little, which makes Pax Pamir a truly excellent game.

Further thoughts (January 2016):
The release of the game has given me a chance to approach the game with a little perspective. I can't tinker with any rules or adjust the deck's distribution any longer. I was actually a little reluctant to play the game after getting my copy for fear that I'd find something that two years of development hadn't unearthed. But, after a couple of months, Pamir found its way back to my table. I'm happy to say that I still genuinely enjoy the game. The semi-structured alliances and the tableau-powered area majority game still feel fresh and challenging. I love the theme and the feel of the game and feel like it nicely captures its subject. 

Though the design met many of its original goals, I can't help but by dissatisfied by some elements of the final project.  The learning curve is steep--which is a shame, because when you get a few experienced players together, the game hums along quite briskly and weave a damn good story in the space of an hour or two. I'm very gratified that many players are willing to invest the time and effort the game demands.         

Original Designer Comment (March 2015): 
Pax Pamir is a riff on Eklund's delightful Pax Porfiriana. In its current state, the game is much more concerned with emergent alliances and power-brokering than its predecessor. Players manage portfolios of political, intelligence, military, and economic resources and attempt to aid Russian or British interests or else help form a new Afghan Empire. Because of it's broad focus, the game is designed to be played with four or five, though it plays well at lower counts.

The game plays in about the same time frame with a similar weight.

This one caught me by surprise. The board interaction puzzle is superb, and the possibilities for deep tactical play only limited by one's experience with the game. This game is a continuous balancing act, a semi-coop with a punch, made even more intense by the closed economy system. Terribly confrontational and obtuse, yet terribly enjoyable. There is a lot more in the Pax system that we have seen, looking forward to the next incantations. Highly recommended.

I'm currently leaning towards saying that this is a better game than PaxPo. Certainly, the people I played with had a lot more fun on the first playthrough than my fumbling first attempt at PaxPo. The streamlining of card abilities to a set of standardised icons simplifies gameplay a long way. The semi closed market makes money all the more scarce, but money is only a means to an end, so overfocus can leave you high and dry. Interaction is through the roof, with spies committing covert warfare and military campaigns. The new victory conditions work really well too. The game ended in a draw, but if I'd known what I was doing, I'd have been committing more covert campaigns to rip up enemy roads and push for a commercial victory. Very impressed.

An amazingly rich card game for such a small box. As a matter of fact, the box should have been a bit larger. Then they could have stashed enough playing material in it. With only 10 blocks per colour, which have to serve as tribes as well as spies, and only 10 cylinders per colour, which have to serve as armies as well as roads, one quickly runs out of playing material. The game booklet suggests to just take a block or cylinder from somewhere else on a card or on the map to perform an action. This sucks...but I have to admit it is the only thing about the game that sucks. The game itself is wonderful and really deserves a better treatment material-wise. When I play it, I therefore add extra blocks and separate roads (all cylinders can then be used as armies).
The players are Afghan tribe leaders who pledge allegiance to the Afghan, the British or the Russian empire. They muster support from the Afghan tribes by placing them in 1 of 6 regions and develop the country by building roads between these regions. They try to protect these assets by placing armies and sending spies to bribe or assassinate their adversaries' loyals (cards in a tableau). Winning conditions themselves change as a consequence of cards being played. Players have to pledge allegiance to the right empire at the right time.  A challenging game not easy to wrap your head around.

I played Pax Pamir once recently (and it's predecessor once as well, but a few years ago). I didn't hate it, but I've no particular desire to play it again. It's very thematic (in card text and possibly effects as well), but very abstract in the board mechanics. It seemed very difficult to wrap my head around any coherent strategy, and the scoring is just plain convoluted to the point of frustration. 

Perhaps with more plays, it gets better, but I really don't care to find out.

Edit: FWIW, this was a 4-player game with all newbies.

One play (and haven't played Pax Po) and very hard to judge. Difficult to get your head around the rhythm of the game and what you're trying to achieve and how to achieve it.

Was making sense towards the end - it's a game of careful and wary manoeuvring punctuated by surgical strikes for the kill - not a Euro and despite the cubes those who like to push cubes around in set-collecting, resource efficiency, VP generating games are going to be disconcerted. 

I haven't entirely convinced myself that there is a good or great game lurking in this but I haven't given up hope - I was left asking what is the right group to play this with - it's not for Ameritrashers, Euroists, wargamers or....?

After four plays (none with four players though) i find this an interesting game and an interesting topic but a game that doesn't quite fire on all cylinders like Porfiriana did. The victory conditions are bit more obtuse and so people tend to not really have much a strategy in play. With Porfiriana it was very easy for me to explain to new players what they should consider doing, here it just ends up as rather aimless chaos. It is still a very unique game and worth a look on that alone.

---------------------------------------------------

provision rating. Not sure if i like this more or less than Porfirana. The playing take that cards against your oponents but compensating them with victory points is gone, there are fewer cards in the game, and the player characters are nameless. But on the other hand the visual design is superior and the game brings its own subsystems to the table, a map with units on it, spies and vying empires. All interesting, not played enough to give it a good shake yet though.

It is a very good follow up in the series in that it is quite different to the original. Worth owning both.

Though I can see why many people prefer Pax Porfiriana to this, PP just goes in too many directions at once for me.

This one is more spare and austere and leave you a tenuous path forward and never enough resources to do what you want.

I like that.  I consider it a feature and not a bug!

Good game! 

Need a few more play to determine a final rating.

2015-12-10 : Most heard sentence during our first play : "if only I had 1 more action then ..." which is exactly what you want in a game. For a Phil Ecklund game the rules here are only medium complexity, but all the elements of the game interlock in pretty complex and fascinating ways. The balance of the game shifts with everything you or your opponents do, so you have to constantly be on your guard as to what's happening. There is literally no downtime in this game.
Only negative point so far is that it suffers a bit from the "Kill Dr Lucky" syndrome where it is upon the player right before the one about to win to stop him.

Pax Pamir, like its sister game Pax Porfiriana, is a brilliant sandbox for player creativity. I’m becoming increasingly numb to euro efficiency games and more receptive to games that offer a place for players to be creative. Both P-P games offer this type of experience in their own wonderful ways.  Like Pax Porf, the framework of the game is building a tableau of action cards with a heavy dose of player interference and attacking -- and room for really clever play. 

The most salient difference (at least for me) is the limitations on hand and tableau size. That is, in Pamir, you have to build your allowable limits for cards in hand and cards on table. Compared to Porf you can't do as much on a turn. But here’s the fun part – the actions on cards are free if the right government is in play. To put it simply, if the blue government is active, then blue actions are free. So you can take your two allowable actions and then several blue actions. Maybe you play a card to change the government first then take a bunch of free actions then take your second action and change the government to something else.

The point of your actions is to win as either the Brits, the Russians, or the Afghans. You ally yourself to one of these and try to have them be dominant during a Topple. The actions allow you to take money from other players, spy on them, wage war against their pieces, and otherwise mess with their plans. It’s taken me a few plays to grok the different actions and the timing of things such that I’m not vulnerable. Some players may bail in this period due to frustration. I had some games, for example, where players were able to tax and spy on me in ways that felt like they had my d*ck in a vice. I’ve subsequently learned how to avoid that and actually put the squeeze on other players. At least I hope.

And it’s so not obvious how to get to victory. In fact, I’m finding games like the two Pax games and A Study in Emerald have a sharp dividing line with people which I attribute to how they put the onus on players to figure out both ends of the equation – what will win me the game and how do I make it happen? Until they grok the experience, players may feel “there are no good options” but it’s just that they can’t see things clearly yet. For me, I love treading water until I find that right moment to catch the wave of opportunity and make a play to win. [i]Chicks dig surfers, man.[/i]

Lastly, I want to mention that at least for now, our games are much quicker than Porfiriana. We can knock out two in the time it takes to play one of Porf. Perhaps as we get stronger at the game and stretch out the experience deeper in the deck our games will elongate. For now, I enjoy the shorter player time and resetting for another match.

Pax Pamir tells the tale of the great game in 19th century Afghanistan between the Russian, British and local Afghan empires.  Players play Afghan tribal leaders with shifting alliances between the empires.  This is done through commercial, military, political and espionage actions to bring one empire to power.  The winner is the tribal leader with the most influence with the winning empire.

It has some similarity to it's predecessor Pax Porfiriana in it's market drafting and tableau actions, but is definitely it's own game.  Probably the most significant differences are the closed economy, the importance of the map and the two tier topple conditions (one for the empire and if an empire wins for the control of the empire).  

Like it's predecessor, it will take a few games to understand the nuances and subtleties, but is well worth the time investment.

RATING: 7
UNO with theme. There are four colours. You win by having the most of a certain colour and play a scoring card. But you can also change the wining colour and play the scoring card in one turn and finish the game. 

Just like in UNO. 

But it is not fair to reduce the game to this. It is a game about shifting alliances that is quick and fun to play. A game that tell stories. Where there are many options and opportunities for the taking. Using the situation and other players actions to your advantage is key. It is a good social activity for a group to engage in.  

Beware, there are many bad game design decisions, it feels like it has not been play tested at all and the graphic design I really poor. It is game where cards are not balances and where unfair situations happen and the game can get stuck in a strange state when nothing can be done. 

But if you can live with that and not care so much about winning and more about having fun, then this might be a game for you. And if you think it might be too complex, it really is not. Buy cards, play cards to get a majority…there are many small rules added that make it impossible to remember all rules but those rules are not all that important anyway. I can´t help wonder how this game would be if it was also “good”, would it then loose some of it´s appeal?

A most excellent design. Four types of cards, four types of victory and the mechanics fit together logically and thematically, weaving a narrative in the process and does a pretty good job at illustrating how political infighting easily leads to ruin.
Not really made for two players as it tends to get a bit lopsided, but it's such a good game that it's enjoyable anyhow.

Im not sure how to rate this. Very in depth which is good. Not sure if i say playing was fun but perhaps winning was satisfying. Which is good for the winner but the other players are perhaps left unfulfilled. It was a challenge to win but not a "yippee!" moment. The first game will be a struggle for everyone to learn and therein lies a  problem. With so many people games to choose from at our get togethers we wont be playing this game back-to-back, and Ill have to reteach it to a new group next time. Meh. Definitely lends itself to a solo variant.

Wow how excited I am to have a Sierra Madre Games game in my collection. I just LOVE the cards and components and the general feeling of it all. I still have to play it extensively but what a small jewel this it. 

My only gripe is the size of the box. While normally I like smaller over bigger anytime, just a slightly bigger box would have allowed to sleeve the cards. 

UPDATE
I've been playing this some lately. While the rules are not the easiest things to grasp in a single game, after a couple of games - as long as I'm doing everything correctly - they should be no issue. 

The issue is how to play effectively. It is not easy to know what is the best course of action any given turn since the game may change significantly during the course of play. We'll see!

Another thing is how this scales to many players. 5 players games looked a little chaotic and cramped, while maybe 4 is the right number of players for this game. 

UPDATE
OK now, this is definitely growing on me, and I'm starting to love it. It is truly an intricate gem of a game. Such a story, such a struggle is made for epic novels... this is the nearest thing to a card game DUNE can be. 

UPDATE
By the way, the expansion is FANTASTIC. A nice game has now acquired a soul. Afghanistan of the Great Game comes to life. I could feel the heat, could hear the elderly whispering, I could smell the scents of the Afghan night. I truly felt like a leader of a mountain tribe. What a game!

As is obvious from the name, the card play (hand management, market, and tableau) and Phil Eklund's development on the game, Pax Pamir's provenance is certainly from Pax Porfiriana.

That said, Pamir is more buttoned up mechanically and seemingly less chaotic than Pax Porfiriana. Both excellent. This is a good addition to the budding line.

well, I like the original Pax, but I can think of at least a half-dozen eras I would like to see with a follow-on game and this isn't one of them:

-Renaissance
-Rome (i.e. Republic of Rome)
-Solar system exploration (i.e. High Frontier)
-Full imperialism era, not just Afghanistan
-Rail barons/transcontinental railway
-Pre-WW2 Europe (capitalism/fascism/communism)
-Medieval Europe (i.e. Empires of the Middle Ages)

given the mental overhead of a PE game, it would really help to have a more mainstream topic to sell other gamers on.

RATING: 8
Pax Pamir continues in the tradition of Pax Porfiriana in presenting a great deal of creative dickery in manipulating conditions, negotiating with others, and ever shifting temporary alliances. The closed economy here is also brilliant in that money is not only extremely tight, but money always changes hands, sometimes forcefully if you try to stockpile money too fiercely! Also, the map not only locates the action as it happens (shaping what can be done where and when) but also largely helps to visualize who is or could be winning the game under diverse situations. Two actions per turn means that it is possible for the game to keep moving at a decent pace as well (so long as all members around the table play by the seat of their pants (and announce publicly "I win next turn if" statements); this is especially the case as the board is as volatile and fickle as the players who sit around it.

Eklund's games continue to be impenetrable and troublesome. But no designer meshes theme and mechanics so well. Pax Pamir puts more emphasis on manipulating a board with each player's tableau interacting with each other. It makes for a difficult time watching other players across the table and what their cards are doing.

RATING: 2
Pax Pamir is straight out of the Carl Chudyk-school of game design. It features minimal components crammed with information, both a steep learning and skill curve, rules that are mechanically complete but don't flow well, a set of disparate mechanics that don't provide clear paths to victory for anyone other than seasoned players, and wild swings in positioning. I intensely dislike this style of game and Pax Pamir has nothing in its mechanics that provokes a positive response from me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One play only with 4 inexperienced players that ended early with an economic win on the first topple that could have been blocked easily by players with more experience.

To me, it's more intuitive and easier to teach than Pax Porfiriana, but there's still a lot to take on board to assimilate how all the pieces fit together and come up with what looks like decent play - but hey, it's a Sierra Madre game and that depth is why I like them.

Can definitely see the possibilities in how the various win conditions mesh with the card play and I really like the spatial elements that are not in PaxPo.

Rating is provisional until I've played another game or two.

Initial 2 player experience: 

This could become a favorite game. It's too early though for me to decide. Much will depend on my experience of 3 and 4 player games. What I wish to know before I set a higher rating:

- how well balanced is it?
- will it be to chaotic for strategies lasting more than a couple of runs?

Update: hm, this could be a gem...

After a gaming night with friends: Pax Pamir is hands down a fantastic game! Wow, we had so much fun with how loyalties worked with one or more tribes sharing common interests, how sudden a regime change could change the map totally and so on and so on.

A brilliant strategy game with temporary alliances and a challenging situation changing each turn. I won't say it's overly tactical, but you need to be flexible and constantly think of a couple backup plans if there's a change in the political situation you couldn't expect or the market doesn't refresh your way.

Compared to Pax Porfiriana, which leans a bit more towards the economics, Pamir's focus is more on the spatial aspect, units on the map and how the spies make their way through player tableaus. Not sure which one is the better game, but because of things being a bit more out in the open Pamir feels slightly easier to grasp.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Took me a bit to wrap my mind around the scoring and card interactions but after the rules were understood, I really enjoyed this iteration of the Pax system. I may prefer this one over Pax Porf after one play of each - need to get in more plays of each! May be better with higher player count. Wish it came with a board (board comes in deluxe version of Pax Porf. as it works better than the card map. Type of government determines available free actions which are available outside of your normal two actions. Money can be fairly tight.

RATING: 9
Shockingly good with 3 players. Our 3-player variant promotes a longer game and avoids the 2-1 faction split. (We play with the Honeymoon variant but not Weak States):

1. We randomly assign starting loyalty such that each faction is represented by one player. Each player then takes a starting loyalty card corresponding to their random assignment.  

2. Turn order is established using Initial Market Score for each faction, with turn order proceeding from the lowest score to the highest.  Initial Market Score for each Faction = Total RANK of Patriots of the Faction in the Market - Total COUNT of Loyalty Prize bands of the Faction in the Market. (In the case of a tie, the faction with the left-most Patriot would score higher. Before scoring the initial market, slide any Patriots in the first 2 columns over to the 3rd column so that said Patriots are guaranteed to be available for the player going third.) 

3. The first player to win ANY 2 Topples is the victor and ends the game immediately.  Otherwise, after 4 Topples, the player with the most Topples wins.  The A1 tiebreaker is used as in the base game to determine the winner of a tied Topple. The A1 tieabreaker is also used to determine the victor of the game, if, after all 4 Topples, there is a tie in most Topples won.

Plays like Pax Porfiriana however, the symbols are cleaner and easier to understand.  It is a set in central Asia in the 19th century.  

Played this with 5 players and must admit it ran way long.  It got to the point where I needed to get up and do something else when it was not my turn, I was so bored with the downtime.  I need to play again with few players.  

Right now, I think Pax Porfiriana is the better game.

Phenomenal game where I feel I just scratched the surface.  The rules are challenging, especially the ones that are not part of the routine actions.  Takes at least three full plays to nail them down (especially the often forgotten ones for events that happen only few times during the game).  So many ways to play/strategize make it highly replayable.  5 or 4 players with Nations Building rules makes for a very long match (so far between 3.5 and over 5 hours).  It is a very different game for Pax Porfiriana with whom it only shares the name.  Can't wait to get this to the table again.
By the way, this game is brutally cutthroat.  The level of destruction and the fluidity of the board and power balance is something to behold.  The game gets better with every repeated play and is very replayable.

What a great system!  All of the information is public to all players, so it's the way in which a player uses his/her tableau of characters, armies and enterprises that make the difference.  True strategy with no luck and I love it!  The economic system and card draw is excellent and I can see this system being used in many other simulations. 

The game also lends itself to some great story-telling as events and actions lead to other events, causing knock-on effects across the board.  And the game is never the same... great replay value!

I like this game but don't look forward to teaching it! I think you need 2 or 3 games to get past trying to learn the rules and start expressing your strategy / tactics through your gameplay. That is for most normal people. I have played it 6 times and am still unable to express myself. I am surprised the game doesn't have some sort of facility where the three empires (British, Russian and ... well two empires and the Afgans) can choose not to align themselves with you the player. Nobody would align with me. How can I enjoy it so much but be so inept?!

A great card game, that is made better by the board that comes with pax porfiriana ( I cannot imagine playing it without the board). 

I found it a little easier to learn than Pax Porfiriana which goes to show how bad I am at that game. I think the map board is key to this as I found it much easier to visualise the geography of the game on this as opposed to pax por's card tableauxs.

Great game, looking forward to playing it loads more, as is everyone who plays it with me as one of them will win!

I can see why people could really like this game, I really do: lots of actions to take, it takes clever cardplay to succeed (the victory condition is difficult to meet), and every game will follow a different path...  but it reminded me of a longer, more complicated/heavy version of Fluxx. For my taste there were far too many fiddly rules things to keep track of not only in opponent tableaus but the main board, and the rapid changes in winning conditions made the 2-actions per turn limit more frustrating than fun. This is not a bad game in itself, but it is a bad game for *me*.

This game recreates "the great game" of England and Russia vying for control of Afghanistan. Its a drafting game where you build a tableau (Think 7Wonders). Each card give actions that help you secure influence in Afghanistan. Whats great is that people can work together, but winning is NOT based on which empire wins, but based on your loyalty points. A complex but Richly rewarding game.

Edit: I have now played one 3 player game, two 2 player games, and several times solo. I really like this, in particular I like how each of the cards pertains to a specific map location, and how the player tableaus serve as the spy network map. I'm not sure about the sort of anything goes negotiation in the game. I understand what the designer was getting at, but as described on a strategy thread here, this kind of negotiating can lead to Topples never happening. It has not been a problem in my games so far, since I'm not a heavy negotiator, and the people I have played with haven't been, either. I love the layout of the cards - there is a learning curve to the game, but the icons make it relatively painless.

Above all, I am impressed at how different this feels from Pax Porfiriana. Porfiriana is one of my favorite games, but I didn't want some cheap reskinning of that game. This is far from that. It feels like a brand new design to me.

Has finally arrived, and looks beautiful. Seems quite a bit different from Pax Porfiriana, lots of new concepts. Love the card layout. Still absorbing the rules, but I am very much looking forward to playing.

8.0 Rating is preliminary, based on a few solo plays, two handed and against the AI as well as a sense of Cole Wehrle and Phil Eklund's other designs.

It plays quite differently than Pax Porfiriana.  It's less messy and chaotic feeling with all of the same kind of potential for player interaction.   

That said, I didn't really understand the potentialities and energy of PaxPor until I played with other people who were looking at the cards differently and found new and interesting tactics.  Looking forward to some group play with this one.

UPDATE 8.5 - this game is cleaner and more formal than Porfiriana, so it lacks some of the joy/sexiness but it's also very different, and I'm happy to play them for different reasons. Really a great game.

A bit mystified after a first play. Having to be allied with a faction in order to improve that faction's standings makes it harder to swing-and-win as in PaxPor, but I should probably give it another shot or two, as I remember PaxPor didn't knock my socks off on the first play either.

RATING: 9
A lot going on, yet every mechanic is a necessary piece of a tightly interlocking system. Unlike Renaissance, I never got the feeling I could wander off and do my own thing for a while. It's constant jockeying for position. I also like how lining up a monster turn needed clever preparation (saving up regime change cards, etc), as opposed to Renaissance's steady growth of action efficiency over the game where once a combo is built it can be executed every turn. The indirection in the victory condition is an extremely interesting aspect that  we haven't explored much with our 3 player count, but which I expect will add a whole extra dimension to the game.

A masterful riff on the Pax system developed in Pax Porfiriana. The addition of the board play and the various unit types give the game its own unique flavor and challenges. The twist of players operating as local tribal leaders attempting to curry favor with the major players in The Great Game is a refreshing perspective.

One word of warning: my initial plays felt a little like something was missing, as they often ended prematurely with most players at the table scratching their heads. That said, more experience improves the game immensely. Even more so, the expansion, Khyber Knives, completes the game and realizes all of its potential. I recommend playing with the expansion as the default mode of play.

RATING: 4
A reimplementation of Pax Porfiriana, the game is set in the 19th century where the British, Afghans and Russians are fighting for dominance. You first chose a loyalty based on the setup cards. You then have 2 actions to draw, play cards or use the action abilities of the cards

Some of the actions include taxing other players, assasinating cards, or taking away cards, so it is chaotic and can lead to unfair targeting.  My experience has been with 5r players, where I was left crippled in one game with no recourse and it was not very forgiving and I had no chance to come back.

Some people really like the Phil Eklund games. I just go with the flow and try to enjoy the narrative and the history or science behind the games. I am not a fan of the randomness or the chaos, but as I mentioned some people swear by his games. I will try them, but they are just not my cup of tea.

[ImageID=247533micro][/floatleft][b]Pax Pamir[/b] designed by [person=35585][/person] and [person=174][/person] (High Frontier, Pax Porfiriana)

In Pax Pamir, two to five players assume the role of Afghan tribal leaders navigating the winds of colonial power in "The Great Game". If either the Russian, British Empire, or Afghan is able to achieve supremacy, the player with the most influence in that empire wins.

An [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21663260]expansion[/url] for Pax Pamir will be available in the Fall called Pax Pamir: Khyber Knives.

Would be better if the rules were clearer, if the game came with a board, and if it had decent player aids. So really what I'm saying is that the box is too small! Purple star cards were too few and too critical. The cost of changing loyalty was just a bit too high and it seemed to me that the mid and late game play was channeled.

This is a slow and confusing game. There are a lot of rules that need to be followed, the cards are seemingly more complicated than is required.

The win conditions are predicated on you having local tribes on the board, but the cards to get those tribes on the board are far too rare and the rate at which you can kill the tribes is too easy.

A wonderful game. The possibility space is as exciting as it is wide. Easily the most accessible of the Sierra Madre Pax games, though there are lots of little rules - don't expect the game to be played correctly unless you have an experienced Pax player at the table.Also be aware of the living rules which are slightly different. Yet to play with the expansion, but it looks great,

RATING: 8
Pax Pamir plays quite a bit easier and is easier to teach than Pax Porfiriana - largely because of the uncluttered card design. The game play is similar but also very different than Pax Porfiriana. I prefer the theme of Pax Porfiriana to this one but this one seems better developed. As with every Phil Eklund game I have played, you'll spend your first couple of games just trying to figure out what to do. However, unlike his Greenland game, you won't be killing off your people as you are learning this one. I have both, so I am happy!

Second in the Pax serie.This time it's the Great Game between the empires of Britain and Russia, with Afghanistan caught in the middle. 
As you lay cards in your tableaux you increase your personal following (spies and tribes) or the power of the state you're currently loyal to (troops or roads. The trick is to have the most influence with the strongest empire at the right time.

A masterpiece of game design that made me question a lot of more expensive games i bought over the years. Better intrigue and political maneuvering than other games 20 times its size. no game is ever the same as you play the great game in the 19th century Afghanistan. The Knives of Khyber improves upon and already stellar game by adding events, capability cards that give players unique abilities if they manage to activate them. JUST BUY IT

RATING: 9.33
Newly discovered but instantly one of my favorites.  The layers in this game never end.  While the great empires vie for supremacy, you struggle between yourselves for influence in those empires while weathering the endless cycle of regimes.  You can have the best cards, the most tribes, the most cannons, and still lose because you were outmaneuvered by a player who tipped the empire they are loyal to into supremacy.  This is a game you win by scheming, inspiration and opportunism, not victory points.

Having your available actions determined by the cards in your tableau is one level of brilliance.  Having a whole mode of actions be free based on the current regime is another.  Sending spies to travel through the tableau of other players is another.  And the struggle on the map between armies, tribes and roads is another still.  I could play this game a thousand times and still be discovering things about it.  A true masterpiece.

RATING: 6
This is a very solid game that comes in a very small box. The general idea is that it takes place during a time that England and Russia were beefing over Afghanistan. You play an Afghani who's goal is to have the most influence with the winning side when the government collapses. Through which cards people buy, you can shift your allegiance, you can shift what the winning conditions are, and you can take actions on your cards, some of which will not count against your action limits for that turn depending on what the current victory conditions are. This is absolutely a complicated game where there are wheels within wheels, and on your first play you are not going to have a clear idea of what looks like a good action, let alone how to keep your opponents in check. 

By the end of the first game I felt like I was starting to get a sense of things, and I could see how this is a deep, well designed and rewarding game. That being said, this game just isn't for me at all. Maybe it's just too wild, but I didn't find the experience of play enjoyable in any way. I'm still working out why that is.

This is definitely one of those games that will take you at least an hour or two of combined rules explanation and play time before all the mechanics finally click together in your head.
But when they do, you'll feel the mental fog dissipate, and the sheer tactical complexity shaped by historical nuance contained in this game will unfold before you.

RATING: 7
Somewhat cleaner design than Pox Po (despite the truckloads of important, but not exactly intuitive, rules) but not as fun. 

I really like the card interaction, the intrigue created by having partners while still trying to win, and by the limited actions that keeps the game moving.

What I'm not totally convinced about is the winning conditions - the game seems to be more about preventing others gaining Supremacy (usually the player to your left!) rather than trying to win yourself. Towards the end of our five player games there was endless discussions about how to prevent X or Y from winning. You didn't even want your alliance to win because the other guy who plays your alliance was ahead in VP! Perhaps this is what the designer was attempting to do with the overall feel of intrigue and subterfuge, but it did feel like a slog for someone who has limited patience for negotiation games.

The Nation Building option is good - makes we want to play a 2/3 player -  but I think I may play around with house rules to make the 5 player game more enjoyable. Perhaps an easier way to achieve victory?  Overall, love to play this more, but this is going to be Con game (or solo once I get the rules) as getting opponents is super difficult.

RATING: 8
Rated after two 2-player games.

What a heady stew of history, brinkmanship, and subterfuge! Not to be undertaken lightly. This is a game where you'll spend the first couple plays doing little more than pulling levers to see what happens. And then pieces start to click together. How to set up an economy. The uses and limitations of espionage. Tribes, roads, armies. Every element of the game can be swept aside by another element. Your plans struggle to make headway against entropy. But it's all there, all the tools you need to set up an avenue to victory and grab for the win.

The presentation is excellent. The cards are handsome and well-designed, and the mounted map (that comes with Deluxe Pax Porfiriana) exceeds what I've come to expect from games with such small print runs.

On the downside, there are some unintuitive mechanics like taxation and roads that stick out awkwardly. And while the designers have made efforts to use every bit of available real estate (cards, the board) to offer rules icons and summaries, Pax Pamir is crying out for a full-sized, color, dual-sided summary sheet of all the game elements and actions. That would go a long way to making the first couple plays smoother.

RATING: 9
„Pax Pamir“ ist ein Kartenspiel für bis zu fünf Personen, das die bisweilen als „The Great Game“ bezeichneten Auseinandersetzungen zwischen dem russischen Zarenreich und dem britischen Empire um Afghanistan zur Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts behandelt. Jeder Spieler stellt einen Stammesfürsten dar, der sich um Einfluss bei einer der beiden Kolonialmächte oder um afghanische Eigenständigkeit bemüht. Gemäß der Sierra Madre-Devise „More with less“ haben die letztlich sprachunabhängig verwendbaren Karten, die jeder Spieler auf einem zentral ausgelegten „Marktplatz“ erwerben und seiner eigenen Auslage einverleiben kann, sowie die Holzwürfelchen und –zylinder (diese befinden und bewegen sich auf den Karten – auch der Mitspieler – und einem Afghanistan und Umgebung darstellenden Spielplan) stets mehrere Funktionen, deren Nutzung abhängig ist von jeweils herrschenden, im Spielverlauf oftmals wechselnden politischen Verhältnissen. Bestimmte politische Rahmenbedingungen erleichtern oder erschweren das Ausführen durch Karten gewährter Aktionen. Erlangt in einer der maximal vier Wertungsrunden Großbritannien, Russland oder Afghanistan die Vorherrschaft, gewinnt derjenige Spieler, der bei der vorherrschenden Macht über den meisten Einfluss verfügt. Zwar ist der Aufbau einer eigenen Kartenauslage das Herzstück von „Pax Pamir“, dennoch ist das Spiel in hohem Maße interaktiv und konfrontativ: Der Spieler kann u.a. seine Gegner „besteuern“ (d.h. sie ihres Geldes berauben), gegnerische Spione beseitigen, Karten stehlen oder durch einen plötzlich initiierten Wechsel des politischen Regimes alle Pläne der Mitstreiter über den Haufen werfen. Die (im Gegensatz zu „Pax Porfiriana“) sehr übersichtlich gestalteten Karten erlauben hierbei stets, die Möglichkeiten der anderen Spieler im Auge zu behalten und seine Taktik ggf. umzustellen.

RATING: 6
A fascinating game that is not nearly as random as other games with Phil Eklund's name on them, but still has a lot of the theme introduction and riding-the-waves type of tactical reaction.  However, the information horizon here is longer, and the game generally more stable, so there is more chance to plan ahead, forge political alliances, and very low chance of feeling locked out.

There are a lot of easily forgotten but very critical special case rules.  That hampers but does not prevent my enjoyment.

It might be a better game than Porfiriana - with more interesting tactical choices particularly with this whole actions-on-cards thing. But I found it more abstract, the theme less engaging. Would have to play both a lot more to be able to make a fair judgement though.

As another gamer here put it:

"Pax Pamir is straight out of the Carl Chudyk-school of game design. It features minimal components crammed with information, both a steep learning and skill curve, rules that are mechanically complete but don't flow well, a set of disparate mechanics that don't provide clear paths to victory for anyone other than seasoned players, and wild swings in positioning."

I love this type of game. Nothing about the decisions is easy. It rewards repeated play and newbies aren't expected to do particularly well. It's so crammed with information it's practically dripping and oozing theme from every ink pore. Wonderful stuff. My kind of game.

Complex drafting card game in which players are tribes that are loyal to the British, the Russians or the Afghans, during the struggle for control of the Pamir Mountains in the XIX century.The victory conditions change during the game; nevertheless, to win you have to be loyal to the Power that holds supremacy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impressions (after 3 plays): Relatively easy to learn, teach and play compared to Pax Porfiriana and Pax Renaissance. However, the more streamlined play comes at the cost of thematic immersion, which is deeper in the two other Paxes. One of my plays was a two player game and we both chose to be loyal to the same faction. This particular game session felt a bit wonky, since it simply boiled down to a struggle for influence, with the two other factions having no presence or much bearing on the game. My two other plays were four player games and had more interesting dynamics. 

At this point I do not see Pax Pamir replacing Pax Renaissance as my favorite in the series. However, it looks like a great game which I am eager to explore in more depth.

After having played Pax Porfiriana a couple of times, I got to play this.  It has a different feel with the closed economy and a tangible map as opposed to PaxPor's abstract one.

"Pax Pamir is a follow up game in the tradition of Phil Eklund’s Pax Porfiriana" this time set in what is now Afghanistan. 

i REALLY REALLY liked this game. fascinating subject and intriguing game play. see also PaxPorf below. there is very strong geographic component to PaxPa vs Pax Porf. the geography really came to life visually on the play area. i loved how tension mounted as cards were played into the alliances (British, Russian, Native) to indicate influence, reminding me a *bit* of Konig von Siam. i can see PaxPa and PaxPorf taking time to master! i loved them both but the geographic elements give PaxPa a slight edge for my tastes.

Cole Wehrle has created something special in Pax Pamir.  It uses some of the same systems as Pax Porfiriana, but it is definitely its own game.  Playing one helps in learning the other, but there is a lot that's new in Pamir.  It benefits much more greatly from a board, to name the most obvious difference.

Mine was an incomplete 5p game that we called after several hours.  I enjoyed that play notwithstanding the length.  

I wish I had a group that was devoted to the Pax games.  I like them a lot and can see how I might like Pamir even more than Porfiriana. The trouble is getting them played.  With a game like Pamir, designed as it is for larger player counts, getting it played will be doubly difficult.  But arrange a game, invite me, and I'm in.

3 plays, only the last one with the correct rules!

Wow, such a cool game! I think I may prefer it over Pax Porfiriana, but I've barely played that so it's hard to know for sure. This is a game that's hard to describe! You have multi-use cards, a bit of board (spatial) play, and a lot of unique cards (only a subset of which you'll see in any given game)! Somewhat chaotic, very thematic, with so much to think about!

RATING: 6
First game was 4p and completed (improbably and by a hair) on the first topple. That was a little dissatisfying as basically nothing had happened, though the improbability of it made it kind of exciting.

The beginning of the game (and the entirety of this first particular game) feels very slow. The board is empty and players have almost nothing. In theory the particular cards on offer in the market should provide some direction, but early on you're just buying things to get a little foundation in the various arenas (military, spies, etc.); there's little in the way of interaction or opportunities for tactical cleverness.

It is curious how easily and frequently the regime type (and thus the win condition) can be changed.

Compared to Pax Porfiriana, Pamir feels more abstract, less like a simulation. I do appreciate that individual cards do not have unique characteristics that you have to read, and you just look up the icons in the manual. I also suspect that the take-that screwage is less brutal in Pamir. It seems more committed to being a strategy game.

I worried about a King of Siam comparison, and maybe I still should, but Pamir makes vastly more thematic sense and shouldn't (I think) feel as directionless.

More play needed.

...Welp, I don't get it. The game does a great job of making Afghanistan seem like a barren wasteland: There's usually not a lot on the board. It's not just that you have limited opportunity to put things there, but that it's so easy for armies to destroy anything that hasn't been properly defended. Placing units on (prescribed places on) the map is like a secondary bonus when you play a card into your tableau; getting the card played is typically the important thing, and trying to get armies there to defend the stuff is not top of mind. (Especially roads! To really defend them you'd need armies at both ends, and on top of that they hurt more than they help because they can make you vulnerable to getting taxed!)

The situation is similar with the espionage game, where spy cubes run around across the tableaux. Your cards are vital, especially the political ones that permit a larger tableau. You cannot protect against assassination (or bribery, which is more expensive) without the counter-espionage ability that kills other people's spies; maybe it's my imagination but that ability seemed really rare. My second game devolved into thermonuclear war at one point, just with the spies and cards.

In any case, what is the long-term strategy in this game? Since your allegiance and especially the win condition is so flexible, I suppose it's just to try to keep as many roads to victory open as possible. When a topple appears in the market, there may be extremely little time left to do any further positioning. Whether you can at that point secure a win or prevent someone else's win seems like it will be due to good tactics at best, luck at worst. It does not seem likely that having a good strategy over the course of the game will be able to put you in an unassailable position, due to the strength of offense and the ability of others to gang up on your personal assets.

There is an interesting factor in that Afghan units are totally spared when a topple fails. (A topple can either succeed, ending the game; be discarded after languishing in the market due to nobody thinking it advantageous to buy it; or fail, when someone buys it but no one can win.) This makes me think that the Afghan loyalty is the "best" and people might gravitate towards it. (However, it is also no good to be in a situation where a fellow Afghan-loyal player has the right to tax you.)

This game struck me as incredibly long. Did I think too hard about it? The deck isn't that big but you don't necessarily draw from it every turn. If people aren't buying, the market stagnates (and this is the game clock).

Speaking of the market, it isn't very exciting. Lots of one-star cards which are mostly trash; even if they're free, they need to fit in your hand or your tableau. (Though actually, having said that, it might be an OK move to "buy, play, immediately discard" crappy cards just to get a unit build, but I dunno... It would take up your whole turn, and wouldn't work with spies.)

I may try to tweak the game. I like that it's easy to learn (compared to Pax Po), and I like the things that could potentially occur in it.

Very impressive. I would recommend playing with more than three players to ensure loyalties are competitive.

It takes on an anti-coop feel when a topple card is close to being purchased as everyone discusses the best way to kneecap the upcoming player so that he can't win. I love the sense of being involved with some terrible plot each time we play as I array my forces of a slave market, a colonial militia, and a Polish adventurer against the cold world of 19th century Afghanistan. Play Pax Porfiriana if you have fewer than 4 players.

As a fan of the pax series I find pax Porfiriana to be a bit more fun and zany, while Pax Pampir is a bit better mechanically. I also strongly recommend looking at the expansion, Pax Pamir: Khyber Knives.  This expansion enhances this game to where I believe it becomes the best Pax game.

So original! Really cool.
The 3-layer conflict: economic, warfare and inner agents. Amazing! 
This game gives me the feeling of 30 hours of play in Sid Meier Civilization (video game) during 2 hours! I mean the ways of interaction between players' races in SMC.
Pax Pamir is a game where you have to think like a small political leader and make really clever and elegant moves to win.
Amazing new theme and a lot of interesting educational text on cards.
Bravo, Phil!

Definitely a slight step above Pax Porfiriana in terms of how complicated the rules are. But it's a more rewarding experience in the end, because there's more represented on the actual play board and less in the player's tableaus. Would recommend with 4-5 people, maybe not 2-3. It's playable, but I feel like it loses a lot with no negotation, and not forcing two players to be in the same empire. Still very playable as a direct war game with 2-3 though.

+ Pax Porfiriana / Pax Pamir board.

Very good "sequel" to Pax Porfiriana. As good as and possibly better than its predecessor with the addition of a map and more streamlined gameplay.

Great game. Quite different from Pax Porfiriana and also simpler, more direct and faster in many aspects. You have to pay much more attention to the other players. I love the supremacy-loyalty victory system and the majorities aspect with the map. The spies are very important. A great game for 4-5 players groups. Another great step in the Pax series evolution.

The early rumblings about this game were that it was a simplified version of the Pax Porfiriana engine and one that it was destined for even more popularity than its predecessor. While it has achieved that in some circles, overall it didn't seem to make quite the expected splash. Now that I've played it, I see why.

It certainly looks simpler, the cards are fairly uniform in appearance and there is no text (except the usual Sierra Madre historical flavor text) at all. The iconography is easy to understand and there aren't all that many symbols to learn, so in that respect, it is actually easier to understand the cards than it is in Pax Porfiriana. The simplicity ends with the iconography. The rules are full of minutiae and on first read, it seems like an awful lot to remember. Fortunately, there is a small player aid that while again, is filled with iconography...it is all very clear and covers nearly all of the hard to remember bits.

There are also a few special powers for certain card types that aren't specifically called out on the cards. None of them are complicated, but it is easy to forget your tax shelters or military spies. It'll all click after a few plays, so it's not a deal breaker but it will mean the learning curve is fairly steep.

That's really all the complaining I have to do about it. The rest of the game is, like Pax Porfiriana, the work of a mad genius. There are so many things to consider, so many layers of info to process that it almost feels like a sand box. It's hard to figure out what to do or when to do it, but it's never frustrating. Every action, no matter how randomly you decide to do it, creates more opportunities or more problems for opposing players. Trying to solve those problems yourself opens up a whole laundry list of tools you hadn't considered before. Most of these involve spies, which are by far the most interesting part of the game.

Spies operate via a very unique system. All of the Pax games revolve around tableau building, but in Pamir, the player tableaus actually create another game board. Spies move from tableau to tableau, parking on opponent's cards to gain influence, assassinate or destroy them, or even in some cases, straight up steal them. There are also counter espionage actions too, allowing troublesome spies to be eliminated before they can operate. It's like playing a completely different game along side the one you first started.

This one is going to be a classic. Get it while you still can, especially if you like info-packed historical simulations.

What a great, great game! Insane amounts of strategy in this. Just had an amazing 4p game with twists and turns. The "Nation Building" variant is a must. It's quite hard to learn and even more harder to do well in but it's all worth it.

I can't wait to play more Pax Pamir with the gamegroup that we play it with. The more we play this, the more the experience will be when everyone knows what they are doing at all times. Or atleast they think they do. :D

Two solo plays.  Lots of possibilities with this one.  I wonder if it will have that feeling of nastiness that Pax Porfiriana brings out (Which I love).

RATING: 9
kind of a German version of Risk, that is to say, it is pretty much a complicated game (it took me three sittings to learn the game well enough to play it for the first time), very confrontational (the first time we played this game, we ended up fighting), and the goal is to dominate other players (having said that, the complexity is the ingredient that makes it fun, as other players almost always can do something to hold you back from wining).
the design is very good, and you always have a multiplicity of choices, which can never be enough on a board game. in contrast the designers have done a good job doing this simple: there is only three types of tokens (cylinder, cube, and coin) but each can have two or more functionality. types of cards are also simple, there are six types (anatomy cards, player cards, regime cards, loyalty cards, topples and favor cards) most of which are just simple indicators: player cards are just a quick over view of some the rules and having an individual identity in the game world, while loyalty cards indicate initiative and loyalty at the start of the game (which has a bonus if the selected empire wins), regime cards just indicate the current regime (political, economic, military and intelligence), topples trigger a possible end game, and last of all the 93 anatomy cards which ... that should prove my point: it is well designed but horribly complicated when you face it for the first couple of times.
graphics are also very good, there is a picture plus a short history lesson, which is good for there will be times when a player can make up his/her mind.
I particularly liked the mechanics which keeps the chance factor to a minimum, there is no dice and every card (which is shuffled) that turns up, goes straight at the sixth column which makes it very pricey to acquire at first (ah ... the Bazaar, that is genius, prices are not set in stone and change during the game, and you have the opportunity to foresee the market). there is also the possibility of making deals with other players: we have used it sparingly and as the last resort, but it worked out pretty great. all of that makes the game well balanced, and the possibility to change loyalty can change your fate in one turn.

I can see why others might like this game, but it wasn't for me.

Pros:

- Really nice graphic design and components, although the text on the player cards is too small.
- Some interesting mechanics, particularly the use of the mode and the impact icons. 

Cons:

- It just felt like a lot of huffing and puffing for no actual gain or enjoyment. We hadn't even got to the first Topple card before I'd pretty much lost interest.
- The rulebook that shipped with the game wasn't too good. The living rules v1.2 were better, but we still ended up having to refer to the various unofficial play aids that have been produced (thank you to those people for taking the time and effort!).
- Although there are some interesting ideas and mechanics, it didn't (for me at least) add up to a particularly engaging or enjoyable game.

I wouldn't want others not to try it though. One man's meat and all that.

This is one hell of a game, and while its roots in Pax Porfiriana are visible, this stands on its own without any trouble. I would like to play the heck out of it, and am lucky to have friends who want to explore it with me.

I love how there are so many options, alternatives, incredibly tough choices, and how the game rewards creative, and imaginative thinking. This may grow into one of my absolute favorites. The Pax series is one to keep your eyes on!

Oh, and I love how Sierra Madre Games leave me feeling like a more well-rounded person after delving into their titles. They teach me about periods of history I may never have researched otherwise. I adore the heck out of learning this way.

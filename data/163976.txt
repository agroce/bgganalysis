Fun game to play with friends between heavier weight games. Enough going on to give some thought towards strategy, and variation between games so it definitely has some replayability. Great theme and artwork too, overall a game which made me happier having played it so it's definitely one I would recommend.

Exoplanets is a medium-light game, where players create their own planetary system on the table. Players add to the common star, tiles which represent various planets or moons (that protect planets or help create life). Each of these tiles/planets give a different number of tokens (water, atmosphere, asteroids and light) and each planet has their climatic condition, which allows us to create life on these planets. Players can also interact trying to interrupt opponents planets by using space effects, by space tales or fulfill goals to earn more points at the end of the universe. But the players need to know that they are all creating mutual planetary systems.

Nice euro that plays in a short ampunt of time (12-15 minutes per player).

There are elements of "take that" effects which I normally don't like, but in this game it felt ok.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
This one offers a new and unique theme for sure, which overall works pretty well with the mechanisms in the game, but the game simply has to much downtime between turns.  Not being able to see what special power / scoring tile you will get really makes it tough to plan before its your turn, and causes the game to feel too long for what it is.  Overall wouldn't mind playing again, but not something I would probably ever ask to play again.

RATING: 6
No deja de ser un euro, pero la tematica de la creacion de planetas esta tan lograda que tiene bastante encanto.
Bastante necesaria la inclusion de las expansiones Gravedad y Space para ampliar los tiles y tener alguna opcion de cambiar unos recursos por otros.
Personalmente una de esas joyas que dudo que sobrevivan a su campaña de kickstarter y por ello me siento feliz de ser propietario de una de sus copias.

Played a full game demo at Origins 2016.  I'm still undecided, but certainly enjoyed it more than I thought I would based on my previous knowledge of the game from watching a video when it was on Kickstarter the first time.  Also the U.S. version is currently on Kickstarter and is going to fix some of the issues with the current version.  I think Alex is backing it.

RATING: 5
Ultimately kind of uninteresting.  It's less of an area-control competition, and more of an exercise in doing the best you can with the random resources, random goals, and random "take that" powers that you happen to draw.  The whole experience is therefore not very rewarding, as you are very much at the mercy of what you draw.  Surprisingly, the decisions are interesting at the start of the game where you have a couple of choices for where to put your planets, and you can decide whether or not to pursue any given goal.  Late game, you have less choices on where to put planets (so less control over your resources) and less opportunity to complete the goals you draw (so it's really up to the random draw if you luck-sack into something useful or not).

Love the look of those tiles tho ...

Great game that plays fast and provides quite some interaction between players.
Backed it up on Kickstarter and I am quite satisfied with the results.
There are a lot of Combos to make to net some points which make it a puzzly game to find the most suitable planets to allocate and space tiles to use/work towards.

The minor expansion of Gravity enables to reduce the tension between punishing plays and brings an alternate mechanism to get necessary resources providing a nice Eb & Flow.

This is a light innovative euro-game. The players take the role of a creator in a far away planetary system. Fortunately one does not have to wait  hundred of thousands of years for creating a planet or life on it. It can happen in one game play. For each type of evolution be it a planet or life or species on a planet, players score Creation Points at the end of the game. The winner is the one with the most points. Easier said than done. 

The Universe is chaotic and results unpredictable. No play is similar to another one and there are so very many different factors involved that playability is assured.  The player mat helps for sure the game play and procedures because one has to monitor effects taking place on specific orbits around the star. Each player creates a planet by choosing randomly from a bag and places it in orbit. This gains him resources like energy, water or gas. Each planet needs specific resources for life to thrive on it. So far things are easy. 

Conditions on planets are formed accordingly to the space environment around them or next to them by space tiles. Some space tiles are threatening to life, others are beneficiary and some might make life more complicated and difficult to evolve. Some space tiles will give bonus Creation Points on certain orbits or planets and other will decrease your scoring. The game ends when all energy resources from your star are depleted. The number of resources depends on the number of players. I own the KS version and the add-on stars which certainly augment a lot the flavor of an otherwise bland core mechanics of play. 

With the expansion rules for the add-on stars, the kick-starter space tiles and gravity tile, there is more interaction between players, more variety, more options and more unforeseen results. The only down fall is that the more players participating the more one has to wait for his turn to come and this because when a player's turn comes, he is faced with various choices and dilemmas for which he has to find the best option. 

In general this is a nice approach to education for the evolution of planetary systems, a fun time being a creator trying to evolve life on an imaginary space world and a pleasant recreataion.

I played only once but the game is amazing: simple rules, a lot of choices, nice artwork. This is euro-style game, with several nice mechanics (e.g., goals tiles that may be spent as upgrades or downgrades of certain planets, instead of getting VP for them).

I am waiting for KS!

This is interesting. I liked the look of this and a lot of the reviews said it was quite cut-throat... Our game was not at all cut-throat.. indeed the cut-throat cards seemed quite underpowered for the amount of resources you needed to spend to get them into play.. and you opponent could quickly undo any damage you are able to do.

I think I need to have a good look over all the FAQs on this one as we had a lot of questions that the rulebook didn't answer. 

Overall its a fairly short and quick little game and I can see plenty of replayability and plenty of options for this one. looking forward to another game of this.

Great theme and ideas, just needs more space and time to develop into its fullest of ideals.

There are elements where there are designed incentives to encourage player interactions, but then the punishment for doing those things can be even greater (ie laying space tiles), as well as missed opportunities for more player interaction (ie more with piggybacking/sharing a same planet tile).

There are some interesting ideas behind this game, but all in all it feels very underdeveloped in every aspect.

It could be cleaner, tiles should say what they do and get a better balance. There's not much you can do, no way to make cool moves and it's pretty much completely random.

Nice idea, cool concept, but badly executed.

Fun quick game about creating a solar system and populating it with life. Select planet tiles from the bag or reserve pile and place them in the solar system. Collect resources, create life and play a space tile to alter the system. You only have so many life tokens so there is tons of strategy especially with space tiles altering the solar system and your strategy throughout the game. Component quality is good and the tiles are small so it doesn't take up a lot of table space. My only complaint is the hideous new cover art and I regret not getting the play mat.

After a couple of plays, this one hasn't really caught me. The mechanisms are well thought out, but somehow it doesn't really excite us. There is a bit too much of a waiting game, and the spoiler-moves are too powerful. We haven't tried it with the kickstarter-extras yet, that might change thing up a bit

Each of us had five tunes, so really a kind of filler. Lots of disk variations, but that just made it feel very random for scoring. Some of the gameplay fine but did not set me aflame. Still, it is short and in the end easy to understand so would play again.  Not sure I like that life can automatically form everywhere, as i think there are some requirements that cannot be met by every planet.  All the little, tiny, hard-to-punch-out round markers were a bit of a waste.

First scoring after prototype play. Create life on distant planets and complete hidden goals. They may change each round, but still you can decide which ones you want to keep. 

Variety of decisions to be taken, as you can expand system with new planets, create life on existing ones, or even grow it to create species for more points. But keep in mind that you have to stay focused on your goals, as the time is limited. The central star of the system grows old and its energy (yellow markers) is depleted each player's turn.

I have played about 3 2 player games at this point.  While I enjoy the game, it's not as good as I was hoping with 2 people.  I see potential for more conflict with more players, but there doesn't seem to be any need in the 2 player game because there are plenty of places to put your life markers without needing to fight with someone  (so why would you?).  Looking forward to playing with more people and possibly revise my score.  I may also try making the universe more limited or adding more turns to spice the game up.

Update:
After you get the hang of this game, the two player game gets a lot more competitive.  Also, I've played a 4 player game at this point and can say it is very smooth and enjoyable.  The board is just a mess when we're done with all the modifiers, a very interesting game.

RATING: 4
A simplistic area majority with no second place, in which the goal is to have other players not accidentally go where you want to go (because of randomly drawn goals they might have that you can't see and thus cannot play around).

A game that lives on its theme with terrible theme integration, no attempt at mirroring any aspect of the target theme, and no emergent story.  Seriously, my six-year-old refused to play the game because of how inaccurate it was.

The best parts of the game are barely adequate, and most of it is mildly frustrating.  Not an atrocious game, but nothing going for it.  It's a core mechanic that might be part of a fine game if elaborated and themed more appropriately.  As, the only good thing is the pleasing art style, but it's not something that will carry the game on its own.

A very engaging game about resource collecting, and achieving small goals for points. Each turn, you place planet resources depending on its adjacency and orientation, and displace a space tile which provide a goal, or alters conditions for a planet. The energy resource markers from the star in the centre provide countdown timer. While the potential exists for some take-that gameplay, most of the game is about trying to maximize resources in order to develop life and evolve species that align with your objectives. There is some synchronicity in a few of these goals, but it is largely luck in drawing the right space tiles. Fortunately, there are loads of points to be achieved even without them.

Novel theme and execution, but there are definitely better abstract tile games that I'd rather play. The star abilities added randomness without much depth and there really wasn't a whole lot to think about on a given turn. I recommend a copy of Taluva or Carcassonne instead.

Not that terrible, but way too light and too short (serves better as a filler, which is still totally unsatisfying). I like the artwork/production, but gameplay is just not nearly engaging enough - boring, boring, boring. 

Did I mention this game is boring?

Great components and a very good game of area control. It is a little complex, and you need to make good use of the space tiles. The game becomes more strategic with theuggested variants in Thule book, but the default rules are also well put together.

Unfortunately, just bland.  The game mechanisms don't do anything to capture the theme, and all that is left is a fairly stodgy bowl full of very simple resource gathering and cube pusher mechanics.  Like macaroni cheese.  With no cheese. 
The other problem worth mentioning is the use of tiles.  These can wildly adjust the player scores: undermining strategy and, as usual, leaving the last player in a position of power.
Nice artwork, but taking up increasingly valuable space in a collection that doesn't need shelf packers.

Good theme. A bit too random. Very pretty art,  Didn't feel like enough meaningful choices during the game.

Its a simple simulation of universe creation. The making of planets and its life forms. It has good components and simple game play.

Love how quick and easily it plays. It fairly zips along with some decent decisions to make. Trick is to remember what it is you want to do and not discard stuff you need.

Language dependency: medium

Easy rules and astonishingly beautiful components.
Other thing that I like about this game is the amount of negative interaction ]:->
Unfortunatelly, there is too much randomness - on one hand it ensures longlivity, on the other winning in most cases dependens on luck.

I would treat it as a final game of the evening, when everybody still want something to think about and be a-holes to each other, but doesn't care about winning anymore ;)

Sci-fi territory builder with tile placement and area control. Create planets with varying and interrelated climates of gas, energy, and water. Interactively compete to wipe out or populate these planets with new species as the solar system evolves and expands. The distinctive characteristics of the game are the jagged edged round tiles representing planets that can stack on multi-use goal tokens to create a rule-breaking benefit. I also like the shared nature of the communal solar system as players try to outmaneuver each other. Picking up the personal goal tiles as you play one of your drafted planets is a great variation to the mundane common method of drawing from a stack. Push your luck aspect deciding whether to go full out and deplete all your resources in a single turn big move or to hold back for more surgical strikes.

played at celebration of boardgames 2015.

It's a nice little game, I quite like the theme, but after 2 plays I felt it a bit too luck driven.

Got a second hand kickstarter copy for 9000 HUF @ 2016.10.11
note: actual play count of my copy is -2 (we played this games twice an the 2015 Celebration of Boardgames)

It's such a simple, simple game. Don't let the rulebook size fool you. The tiny little summary on the player aid tells you almost everything you need to do, as long as one person knows the triggered rules for the special tiles.

RATING: 8
Long 18xx with expensive track and a few different types of companies.  Tunnels are an interesting addition to the tile set and the red-to-red bonuses make long-term planning essential when developing track.

I have no idea how to play this game well.  There are enough moving pieces that I have little experience with that I don't yet understand the benefits of features like starting the regional railways vs the majors.

10/2/16: New edition finally out.  Has it's own entry.

11/20/15:  Reprint has been separated into it's own entry.  Yippee, finally managed to track down a copy of the original.  I know some people that can just play session after session of this game and don't want anything else.  Note the SE corner of the map as some issues and is probably 1 hex row longer than it should be.  This was corrected in the reprint.

7/27/14: Now targeted 2014 release.
6/22/14: Targeted October 2013 release.

I gave this a ten after just reading the manual.

After actually playing the game, I know for sure: this one goes to eleven. Seriously. And I don't even really like the movie this quote is from.

Preliminary rating of 8. It has a few interesting mechanics... normal trains that degrade to hex trains as soon as the next train-level is purchased, mountain and tunnel companies that don't count against your stock limit and pay great fixed cash (40 and 10 respectively), destination stops to get the remainder of your cash, and a very expensive map. Although I found the stock market flat, 1844 is an excellent Engineering game.

1880 and 1844 are my 2nd best 18XX (1830 is #1). Not easy to play though.

RATING: 9
So much chrome it can be hard to see the game for all the chrome. 4 different types of companies, 4 different types of capitalisation, 2 different types of trains, floating score boards for mountains, tunnel and mountain "shares" that don't count to paper limits, an incredibly textured and subtle map, actually interesting private companies (sadly unusual), and a delightfully giddy balance between very long term planning and shorter-term optimisations without the idiocy of (say) 1870's 12-trains. I haven't played enough to give a formal rating across several of the player counts, but I'll try and update this comment later as my experience with the game grows:

2-Players: 4.5
3-Players: 8.5
4-Players: 9
5-Players: 8.5
6-Players: 6 or 9.5 -- I don't know

My early concerns on the game being overly programmatic have proven unfounded. Instead I find it delightfully dynamic and am very pleased to own a copy. My only complaint is that I'm not entirely sure the game is worth its length, however I'm not complaining, not yet.

RATING: 9
Fantastic 18xx game. Its a big and long game, though, and its pretty easy to get lost as the networks expand. This is a game that really requires your full attention and concentration. 

Its been hard to get to the table, but I hope to get more chances to play. It feels like there are a variety of strategies to pursue.

This is one of the awesomely epic 18XX. There's a lot of different company to play here, lot of things to track, and lots of chrome. But not just chrome, the game could be maneuvered around it. 

- Dynamic Priority deal and player turn
- 7 different types of company (not just private and major)
- Couple bonuses on run
- Interesting train type (and rusting system)
- Not really brutal stock trashing, but still possible to do. 
- Stock left in poll decrease price.
- Must do highest revenue route.

This is clearly one of the heavier 18XX. Not for newbie 18XX indeed. There's too much decision path to be made, and lots of mistakes can be corrected if you do the right thing. But some of them are not obvious. 6-8 hours is clearly the correct time.

After a first play (5p under 7h) I can only say that this is probably the most interesting game on the 18xx series I've played. There are several mechanisms that I really enjoyed like the steal of the trains after the OR set and the original priority deal.

On the gameplay I find it a pretty constructive game rather than a destructive game a la 1830, which is a good thing considering all the things that are going (3 different company types, mountain companies, tunnel companies).

In our first play we've managed to keep it a little bit under the 7 hours, so this beast will probably have his chance to get the table more often than I thought.

Great!
In first game(s) it's a bit overwhelming, so definitely not for casual playing. But with right people and enough time, this could be The One.

Got several fresh ideas compared to other 18xx games I've played (eg. turn order, few kinds of companies). However it takes definately too long (13 hours for a first game) to be enjoyable.

I'm dying to give this one another try.  There's so much going on in this game that you could play it every week for a year and still find something new on every play...unfortunately it takes a 10-14 hr investment for that payoff.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Simply marvelous, very rich, engaging, well considered. Of the 30+ 18xx games I have played since 1986, this is the best.

In contrast, 1853 is the worst. I have played both the original and the reprint.

A really big 18xx with different types of companies and trains, and even clear pieces for tunnels.  A lot going on here, and a fascinating experience.

RATING: 8
Takes the operating round complexity up to 11, a bit like 1841 takes the SR complexity up. One play told me nothing about how the game is really won though, and it's too long to get on the table often.

RATING: 10
A great new 18xx game.  Two huge innovations - foreign investors steal a train at the end of each set of operating rounds, helping avoid the poison 4 (or other) train nobody wants to buy, and the player order is determined by money.  Very interesting mix of companies with different number of shares available as well.

RATING: 6
I had fun, and the game is well designed.  But 1824 was the last 18xx game I played prior to to this one.  I thought 1824 was more impressive.  They both are about railroading in Austria, and while they have differing features, cover the same basic ground.

For me, I preferred the cleaner design of 1824.  1844 is a sprawling design, with LOTS of companies, and some non-intuitive train rules.  It felt like more work than 1824.  Also I got the feeling 1824 was a 4-5 hour game, while 1844 is more of a 7-8 hour game.

1844, played in summer 2011.

Very interesting 'advanced 18xx' with a huge banquet of options. Not for the faint of heart. Played once over 3 evenings in summer 2011, taking about 8hrs +1hr of rules.

Features:
The map is large (2-3 times the size of 1830) and has a lot of mountains.
Trains downgrade into 'H trains' that can only travel n hexes (e.g. a 3H train can only go 3 hexes):
3s turn 2s into 2Hs
4s rust 2s and turn 3s into 3Hs etc.
You can opt to buy a H train instead of a regular one, and they are slightly cheaper (this is typically done when you know they are about to be downgraded anyway).

There are:
*6 normal companies,
*3 regional companies split into 40/20/20/20% shares (can only buy H trains)
*5 'Pre-state' companies split into 50/25/25% shares. The first 5T causes the 5 Pre states to merge into the Swiss state railway which inherits all the cash, trains and tokens of the Pre States. Pre state 50/25% shares are converted into 10/5% shares. Share values are adjusted to $100, so if you are over/undervalued you get compensated or must make up the difference (that is only a small amount of money). It also comes with a free 5H train and some money.

There are revenue bonuses for doing north-south or east-west runs.

Another feature of the game is that companies only get half their capital when floated, the other half is released when they reach their 'historical destination' (except for Regional companies), a few hexes away, but it can be expensive to get there.

Furthermore, there are mountain companies which are like private companies and exist as a single hex that acts like the red off board locations but in the middle of the board. They pay $40/turn to the owner, and boost revenues by $10-80, depending on the phase. Also we have tunnel companies, which are similar to mountain companies but only pay $10 to the owner, and boost revenues by $10/city for a train that runs through the tunnel.

RATING: 7
Playtime: ~3-5 hours

Comment: This is a medium to large sized map of Switzerland and you've got a ton of stuff to do in this. Being able to build tunnels and have little mountain private companies is interesting. I think there is quite a bit to explore in this game. It's one of my favorite medium length ones. I really can't wait for Mayfair to release this one.

[b]Update:[/b] After another play of this, I realize how freaking slow this game is initially. The 2 trains slowly disappear and only laying 1 tile a turn feels incredibly slow, especially on this large of a map. Money is super tight since everything costs tons of money. It's a good game, it just feels REALLY slow initially. Also, the component quality is pretty subpar even for a low print game. Everything is paper thin and nothing is really that great. The map looks nice, but everything else is pretty low quality.

Optimal Player Count: 5

Plays well with all counts except for 2 and maybe 3. Typically with 18xx games you'll want 1 player less than max and 1 player more than minimum.

Lots of chrome in this game!  I was stupid and opened up a company on my own down in the south at the start of the game.  I would like to try the game again with a different strategy.  Overall, it is one of the better 18xx titles and one that should see more play.

This is a really gem. I like different companies, tunnels, mountains and the way PD is determined. The game lasts ~7h. There's a lot to do but still I think it is a bit too long. This would be perfect if it would fit in 4-5h time slot.

This is a great addition to the family of 18xx.  The mountains, tunnels, 4 share , 5 share, & 10 share companies make for interesting decisions.  I like the way the auction is done (in order everything is bid to completion, then you move on to the next one).  However, I would like to see future titles get away from the 1830 blueprint for private companies.

RATING: N/A
Well that is certainly a game with a lot going on.  I don't know why but it just seemed to drag on.  I guess it's the difference between the one and two tile lay games.  Plus the H trains make it hard to make a decent payout at anytime during the game (but I guess it doesn't matter since everybody is playing in the same pond).  I'll need to play more but my first impression wasn't great. 2010/06/13

Lots and lots of chrome make this game interesting, but also puts it firmly in the "medium length 18xx" category.

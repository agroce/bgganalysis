It's a decent Euro, just really dry and pretty much themeless. It's called Quebec, but it could have been called anything really. Although I admit that the cascade scoring mechanism is a nice new way of scoring that's quite interesting and unique.

Unlike any other game I’ve played: buildings can be assigned variable point scores, VP majorities cascade from one scoring domain to the next, adding workers to someone else’s building brings valuable advantages.

RATING: 9
Demoed at Origins with my daughter. A very solid, well thought-out game. There is purposeful emphasis on interaction, with each player contributing workers to their opponents' buildings to gain important benefits. You must carefully place your Architect in a place that will benefit others (but not too much!) in order to attract their workers to complete your building. Unique and enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Quebec is mechanically very straightforward.  Aside from using one action to take a leader, your available actions boil down to moving your architect to complete a building and start work on a new one or place workers, usually to contribute to the construction of someone else's building.  Placing on an opponent's building is made worthwhile by gaining you a special action.  An architect move is sometimes forced by running out of workers (it gains you three from the supply).

Quebec layers on interest with a choice of five leaders, who bring varied and useful special powers, a strong spacial element (your largest connected group of buildings will score way more than your others) and a novel end of round scoring for five areas of influence in which the player with the majority in one area "cascades" some of their cubes into the next.  All this and making a leader's life difficult by withdrawing cooperation provides plenty to chew over.  My one reservation is that the game doesn't really develop across its four rounds and hence feels like it plays a little long.  

Production quality is good.  Credit is due for producing decks of event cards with explanatory text in each of three languages. The Artwork runs from dull (the box) to pug ugly (the board).  The English rules are well written.

RATING: 6.5
Initial impressions after one 4-player game: Nice looking area majority game. Although there is nothing random in the game the end result is very chaotic. The game has much interaction because in order to get a bonus action you must help someone else with his building construction. You cant really make a long term strategy because everything depends on what the other players choose to build (meaning the actions that they  are 'offering' to you). The game tries real hard to establish its theme with pictures of the real buildings and by putting historical names on the events and leader cards but in the end it still feels abstract because nothing of these matter in terms of gameplay. The new(?) cascading mechanism is quite cool and powerfull if noone tries to stop you. The leader card that you pick each turn can change your playing style. I want to try this again.  
Update: Played a 5-player game last night. There was more competition for area majority and I tried to stop others from creating long networks of buildings. Still we havent tried the event cards. What do they add to the game?

RATING: 6.8
A bit more of a brain-burner than I was expecting and perhaps moreso than I thought it was worth.  It was fine but perhaps just a bit dry for me.  By the mid-game I knew that I was playing to not finish last out of the five of us and that it was going to take some work for anyone to catch the leader.  To [i]know[/i] that much that early is a bit disappointing (in terms of the game - to me that's a weakness).  I just managed the former but no-one managed to close the gap on the leader.  Others in my group liked it so I would probably give it another try, but I'd hope it showed me more the second time around.

The board has to have one of the most poorly designed I have ever seen for a board games. The background, a nice painting of Quebec, is drowned out by thick, contrasting lines of colors and poorly designed iconography. The theme could have been any theme at all. The mechanics are convoluted. All in all, this is a mediocre game.

RATING: 7.5
On the surface, this game will strike a familiar chord with many gamers.  It is approachable and well bound in its play.  However, within just a few turns of the game, players find that what was clear and obvious has become deceptively challenging.  This is a rare treat for the die-hard gamer.  A quick-ish playing game that surprises you in its level of sophisticated interaction and long term planning.  This is the kind of game that can have you furl your brow and remark on your head hurting all while still being fun.  Definitely worth trying.

Everything seems to fit in this game. Fluent gameplay, a lot of interaction and everything seems logic. Difficult choices to make : choose the right building to place your architect, but then you can't profit of the extra's. If your building isn't attractive enough, other players won't come to your architect. Original but powerful cascade effect in the counting.

AWESOME!

Finally got this one to the table.  Rules are great as we had no issue with them at all.  

The game is exactly what I love in games.  It flows, there is room for tricky play.  You have planning to do, long term but yet you are working on a round by round basis.  In our first game, the three of us played very different games and the game was decided by 3 points.  I can't wait for the next time I can play this...I think my rating will go up from 8.5.

Aug 2016 - It is a 9 now.  I have not played it with any less or any more than 3 people.  After 5 plays so much has been reveled in how to play.  One of my favorite thing in games is the players can drive the time of the game and this has it.  Watching someone just go building to building to gather up usable workers as well as making sure you, and others, are not able to connect in a long chain is brutal.  It's just a crazy game.  Long term strategy and short term tactics are at play in this.  I'm looking forward to playing this with more, soon.

RATING: 5.5
The game is incredibly abstract, dry and dull.  Primarily, it's a game of observation, worker placement and timing.  You get 1 point for each worker in the five regions, and the scoring of the regions is sequential.  Additionally, if you win majority in a region, half of your workers move to the next region; in this manner, some cubes can score again and maybe a 3rd time if you're lucky enough to win the next region.  This leads to a pile-up of cubes and face-offs/brinkmanship in the early regions.  I'm not fond of this type of game with constant fighting (cube buildup) over a few valuable locations while the remaining 75% of locations have very little appeal or usefulness.  Some of the locations become more useful with time, and there are several ways to manipulate the pace/tempo and available actions... but the game is just too dry, abstract (e.g., recounting cube majorities), and boring for my tastes.  The timing of when/if a building is completed on a given round can have a big impact on majorities in the 5 regions.  Completion of buildings is "at will" and ends cubes (if any) to the 5 exterior regions and impacts majorities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is definitely a soul-less cube pusher.  The theme is very pasted on.  That said, it is two area control games in one with a lot of balancing.  There are 4 centuries.  Each century you need to complete building for the end-game area control scoring AND you need to get cubes into the different regions of power for that century's area control scoring.  All this happens by convincing other players to contribute to your buildings so they get bonus actions and cubes into the regions of power they want.  So far I've only played this two player and it played well but I think it will be even better with more.  A solid area control game cube-pusher.

Just played it with 5 and it played great with 5 as well.  Leaders tended to go quicker, though the neutral architect was never taken.  It seemed like there was more screwage in the 5 player.  I didn't find screwage to be high but at least one other player found it too high for his taste.

Keeping this as my one multiplayer area control game.

An abstract...fugly psychedelic board that could have been anywhere else other than Quebec.

The cascading scoring is kinda cool. 

Not sure about the longterm replayability.

Fast play time. First play with 5 players only took 1.5 hours. 

After 4 games, it's holding up. Seems to have different paths: play the cascade or play to have a large contiguous area. It can be played in 1 hour.

A very interesting, uniquely themed Euro with one horribly designed rich-get-richer mechanic. Some people love the cascading scoring, but it can be extremely punishing, and really takes a few plays to understand. 

One early mistake will plague a player for nearly the entire 2+ hour game, and there is virtually nothing he/she can do to recover from it. This also makes the two-player game abysmal, as with a tiny early lead, one player can crush the only competition. Too bad, because the game looks great and has a really original historical theme. Sold.

RATING: 7
Very cool game which I'm unsure I can really compare with anything else out there!

Players send architects out to construct buildings for points, each of which triggers a special ability for any player that helps with the construction.  When a player decides to move his architect, he gets some points according to how many folks helped out with the construction.  So, essentially, when you place an architect, you open up a special ability for other to use, but you also get more points the more people you attract.  Cool stuff!

Helping out with construction also eventually gets your workers sent to an area majority-type scoring, with a super cool "wave" mechanic in which the winner of an area gets to send some of his cubes to the next area to be scored, possibly helping to win majority down the line.

Ok, so my quick overview probably is very unclear, but suffice to say I found it all to be very good!

RATING: 4
A theme I wanted to love. Not my home town, but the capital of my home. Unfortunately, someone forgot to put the theme in the box.

You use cubes to move your cubes into good positions in the scoring areas. The big twist is that the areas score in sequence and some of the winner's cubes cascade into the next scoring area letting them score the cubes twice. Except, that's a very dull twist and cements this game into the soulless category. A shame.

It doesn't help that the board is hideous.

An acceptable cube-pusher with a few layers of action. Borrows the El Grande idea of recruiting cubes from your general supply to become your available cubes.

RATING: 7
Rating based on the full game, sans events. And with half the table totally not into it. Seemed decent to me. I boils down a multi-dimensional area control (basically 2), where one dimension is controlling spaces on the main board (building buildings) to create a large connected personal network for mass end-game points, and the other dimension is scoring of 5 different zones of power at the end of each of the 4 rounds. Scoring there is fairly friendly, with every cube in every region scoring for 1VP, with the catch being that the majority in one region gets to flow 1/2 of their cubes to the next, for additional scoring. There a nice synergy of players feeling compelled to help each other build their buildings, given the benefits which are awarded only for helping others rather than yourself. So it's important to setup the right incentives. You only have 3 basic things you can do on your turn, so there's not too much to get bogged down on, even though there's zero randomness in the game after setup. At lest without the events. I'll probably play once more without events, with players who actually want to play, before rolling events in.

RATING: 5
When I first read through the rules of Québec I was intrigued by the majority mechanism which saw influence from one scoring sphere being moved on to the next prior to scoring the new sphere. That meant that with careful positioning of one's influence, a cascade of points could be unleashed: quite an insidious mechanism. 

And indeed, in practice it turned out that it was indeed insidious. What I hadn't counted on was the game built around it. I was hoping for something with Metropolys-style parsimonity and simplicity of actions, but regrettably this didn't turn out to be the case. In fact, I had left out much of the rest of the game—strange but true. The authors decided to create an incentive-based mechanism to entice players to ‘open up’ mini-actions (of which there are about 15, all different though not in a complex way) in exchange for more points as other players used these actions more often. The catch is of course that the player who ‘opened up’ a mini-action cannot himself take it. In my trial game, the players relying on the majorities scored so well initially that it became hard to see how the point reward for opening up a mini-action would be at all competitive; I trust that the design team balanced matters, though. 

Now incentive gaming is not a silly gimmick, even though its application in games is rare. Unfortunately, compared to the games I know where it is used, Québec is a quagmire of little actions and chaotic point and majority whirls, making it truly hard for a player to estimate what his best course of action is. The ‘carry over’ mechanism, so clear and powerful on its own, now only served to confuse matters further. And we hadn't even played with the even more chaos-introducing event cards!

All in all, my fellow players and I did not enjoy ourselves very much. And that is truly a pity. I am quite certain I would have enjoyed a simpler and streamlined version of the mechanisms, so basically a majority game with just the overflowing (albeit a bit more elaborate to make it sufficiently meaty for a standalong game); or a game with regular majorities and just the incentives (albeit a smaller number of them). The combination... no. Québec to me is too much of a good thing.

[b]Update[/b] A second attempt a long time after the first wasn't very pleasant as manipulating the cascade seemed rather pointless because setting it up was so mercurial. But as I thought about it some more I realised that it really isn't [i]that[/i] important because you can obtain at most 20 VP extra, namely at most 5 spilled over cubes which get counted again for at most 4 times. This is the VP difference that needs to be made up, apart from having more or less cubes in the zones of influence, of course. And how do you do that... well, by building stuff. Ooooooookay. Need to schedule another go and see what happens then.

[b]Update 2[/b] Well, quite simply, the game actually becomes moderately enjoyable... but also painfully linear in execution. Because of the limited number of ways to score points the various rounds feel very samey after a while; it's fairly easy to select the buildings up for construction in such a way that others will help you erect them because those others [i]need[/i] the ability you're offering. There isn't sufficient extortion to make this, in theory, great principle, work as well as it could; and the game suffers as a consequence. Which is in many ways too bad, as there has been a lot of effort involved in getting the historical accuracy correct.

I guess I'm just not that interested in the history of Québec. I've upped the rate in any case to reflect my improved understanding of the game's mechanisms and strategies. 

[b]Update the Final[/b] Let the game go.

After two plays: the heart of the game does seem to be "get cubes on the board quickly", but the details of how/where you do this and when those cubes go to the scoring zones turn it from an optimization exercise into an engaging game. The cascade scoring is an interesting mechanic (and plays out well); the timing tension of receiving active workers is a less obvious but probably equally important / interesting element.

Play is, admittedly, fairly dry; most turns are "put some cubes on the board, which lets you put other cubes elsewhere on the board or score a few points" - it has good top-layer theme (chrome) and foundation theme (underlying mechanics reflect some of the core dynamics of what's being simulated) but virtually no mid-level representational theme: taking actions doesn't at all feel like actually doing in-theme things.

Four-player felt notably richer than three-player.

This is an enjoyable game with several different paths one can take and interesting decisions to make. The theme is quite lost, once the game gets rolling, but I found the gameplay to be fun enough that it really didn't matter. There is no luck and everything is open information.

Quebec offers unique gameplay feel to it with the scoring mechanic and with the semi-cooperation feel, as is present in Brass. As with most good games, there is often several "good" moves one can do, and it results in difficult decisions.

1 Spiel zu fünft: Schön verzahntes Design ohne viel Thema. 
Es gibt eine Reihe von kleinen Dilemmata, z.B. Setzt man den Architekten auf einem sehr begehrten Gebäude ein, kann dann aber selber nicht mehr die Funktion nutzen, oder achtet man stärker auf zusammenhängende Gebäude? Setzt man die Arbeiter bei einem Gebäude ein, dessen Aktion einem viel bringt oder da wo man in die Bereiche kommt, wo man viele Siegpunkte durchs Kaskadieren erhällt?
Trotz gefühlter geringer Aktionsauswahl hatte unser Grübler für ordentlich Downtime gesorgt, ansonsten zügiges Gameplay. Jeder macht immer nur eine Aktion reihum; oft kann man schon im Vorfeld überlegen, was man als nächstes macht.
Insgesamt aber etwas destruktives Spielgefühl. Ich ärgerte mich häufiger, weil etwas nicht so aufging wie erhofft, als dass ich mich freute, weil etwas gut funktionierte. Schön ist, dass es die positive Interaktion gibt, wenn man Arbeiter in Gebäude von Mitspielern schickt.
Das Spiel lebt klar von dem Mechanismus, das Thema tritt im Gameplay sehr in den Hintergrund und wirkt austauschbar.

This could be an 8 but one of the leader cards feel a bit overpowered.  The red one that lets you send your workers to any region.

Nagyon jó játék. Jól kitalált, jól összerakott. Fix 4 század, minden század végén értékelés, de két trükk, hogy az értékelés minden században ugyan a citadellával kezdődik, de aztán mindig mással (más területtel) folytatódik, és halad körbe, valamint a többségben lévő játékos kaszkádol, azaz az ott található munkásainak felét átviszi a következő kiértékelendő területre. A végén még egy végső értékelés, ahol kiderül hogy kinek h sikerült értékes, és egybefüggő házakat létrehoznia. A kerületek mindegyike más és más előnyt ad, így az építkezésnél annak kiválasztása, h melyik házat építsük meg : nagy szerep neki, hisz ha jól választunk sokan akarnak besegíteni az építkezésbe, s így értékes házunk lesz. ha rosszul, akkor kutya sem megy arra, kénytelenek vagyunk mi... és persze fontosak a vezetők is, plusz pontokat hoznak, ha ügyesen használjuk őket. Minden játék más, egyrészt a felpakolás, másrészt a századok miatt.És akkor még ott vannak az események is....izgalmas, érdekes.

This started off well but ended up falling flat for me (as opposed to a friend who pretty much hated it from the get-go). I found there was an interesting way of using buildings on the board to combo actions before your opponents did but in the end all we were doing with these actions was pushing cubes to the corners of the board so as to score them. The buildings were labeled religious, commercial, etc but in fact were merely purple, yellow, etc. Just a cube conversion game where points are counted in .5s and 1s so you could calculate which move would give you the most points per turn.

Whereas I found tension in using the buildings, they get "used up" and flip over such that there are fewer buildings available each turn. This mean that there were fewer and fewer options available each turn and the choices got less interesting and more restrictive. By the end we were all feeling the pinch of "I have sucky options". Not a good arc for a game to build to and similar to the way I felt about Belfort.

Only worthwhile with 5 players.

I waited a year before rating my own game, to let the dust settle a little. As the designer, I am obviously biased, but I still wanted to say that after many, many, many games I still enjoy this one a lot. I wouldn't say the same for of all of my designs, but this one really rewards repeated play. You'll keep discovering new layers of strategy after 20, 50 or even 100 games. Moreover, it's a very interactive game. This, in my opinion, is relatively rare for games with strategic depth and will make this one stand out in your collection.

Some people complain about long turns and Analysis-Paralysis. I find it strange since one goal of the design was to offer few options every turn. Sure, sometimes the best option is not obvious (would the game be fun otherwise?) but IMHO reduced choice is the best way to reduce AP. Give the game 2 or 3 plays and see if the AP goes away... It may just be a question of learning what the actions do and how they are disposed on the board.

Finally: thanks everybody who rated and commented on Quebec. It's always a pleasure to read you!

Talán az eddigi legjobbnak tűnő area influance, amivel eddig játszottam. Persze még kell vele játszani, hogy ezt biztosan ki merjem jelenteni, de elsőre nagyon tetszett. Kevésbé királycsinálós, mint a többi, és színek, plusz akciók, építészek kombinációja, mindig más-más lehetőségeket, mérlegelni valókat nyit. A szabályok elég egyszerűek, ematt akár gatewayként is ajánlható, bár maga a szabálykönyv elég nehezen értelmezhető.

Fascinating player interactions with replayability infused by the placement of the buildings each century and the events.
"Moves as offers" is a fascinating mechanism to games that should be easier to find than it is. This plays as a sort of trading game without any player negotiation. Players are constantly evaluating the cost of taking particular locations because, while they can gain buildings to add to their main group, they also lose the opportunity to use the action themselves.
The cascading scoring gives players a great goal post in between centuries and there is a significant interaction between success in cascading one century and difficulty in the next.

Works very well, but it's much heavier than I usually choose to play (we played the full game). With 3 players one player tended to dominate in the cascades - luckily that was me - but I can see that there'd be more competition with more players and the other points streams would be more viable.

A fun area-control game with novel "cascade-down" mechanic which makes it a hard game to plan ahead and a real brain burner. A good kind of brain burner though... the kind that makes you feel you've had fun even if you lost and your brain hurts like hell afterward. I also like the art in this game a lot.

I'm a little worried that other players have far too much control over reigning in a leader. No matter how good your decisions are, you will not win if players do not help build your buildings. 

That concern aside, however, and I find the decisions in this game deliciously fun. Balancing which action you want to perform with what color sector you want to send your workers with which opponent you don't want to assist in building is wonderfully challenging! Games that make me weigh competing factors like these are always going to provide me an enjoyable experience.

At its heart it's an abstract Eurogame about majorities. While the mechanics are nice it turned out to be a brain burner. As each of your actions effects 3 layers of the game (immediate effect / later effect / options for your adversaries). So don't play this with A/P prone players as they try to figure out all options and counteroptions... The cascading mechanism is innovative but creates also kind of a runaway leader problem. I found the icons printed on the board too tiny. Basicly a good game but a little to dry for my taste. Rating may change with further plays as there is now only one game with 3 player under my belt.

While the setting is different, the theme and goals are similar:  construct the most prestigious buildings and gain power and influence within the city’s spheres of power.  Fortunately, Quebec adds some clever twists and mechanisms that help make it rise above the dozens of other similarly themed games.

It is a game filled with tough and often taxing choices.  It is a game that offers a variety of strategic options with many viable paths to pursue for victory.  There are many opportunities for clever plays that can yield significant advantages and surprises.  In short, it is a very rewarding and rich gaming experience.

Played for the first time last night and really enjoyed this game. Simple and clean rules, actions and mechanics, but there is a lot to consider with each turn. You have to consider the end game scoring, the event cards, lure others to help you complete your buildings when you know it will help them too. Knowing when to take which leaders is another thing to consider, as well as worker management.

L'originalité du jeu provient presque exclusivement à mon avis de la mécanique des cascades de cubes. Le nom de Québec ne caractérise le jeu que par le titre, cela aurait pui s'appeler n'importe quoi. Les différents emplacements de Québec où on peut mettre des cubes auraient pu provenir de n'importe quelle ville à n'importe quelle époque et pour n'importe quel thème. C'est quand même un jeu intéressant par sa mécanique.

I appreciate that there are "interesting" decisions to make and I think it is a unique game however I did NOT enjoy this game-I felt like the cascading mechanic is almost pointless (at least in a 2p) as it's not even difficult to build up a wall (all you need is more than 5 in the next zone to at least tie which will keep the cascading player from continuing to cascade) and the rules were HORRENDOUS and my husband thinks (and I tend to agree) that this game is complex for complexity sake.  The area control ON the board is the priority but the game makes you think the area control in the zones is necessary and it truly isn't.  I think if a few rules were changed/fixed it would have been a much better experience.  Planning to trade away.

A big, hairy Euro-game of worker placement, long-term strategy, tradeoffs and low margins. It has only initial randomization and no hidden information (under the blue rules). I like this game, but I'm abnormally terrible at it. T

So, we played it a few times, and it didn't really stick. I think the main problem my group had is that one or two players will have obviously lost on main groups in the first two centuries and will have little to do for the rest of the game. Even when that isn't the case, the game lasts about an hour longer than it should; there's a lot of "the same" throughout the game. I liked it while I had it, but have now traded it for something else.

Solid game, very difficult valuation of measuring the attractiveness of your architect vs its benefits. You want to play it in a location which will benefit other players so that they will want to help you, but not so much that it is detrimental. The cascading effect is a neat mechanic for providing a variable sized bonus to the majority owner of an area which can be compounded by controlling multiple adjacent areas.

The board looks very busy though, it is quite possible to make a mistake in this game simply because you overlooked something (often it is the cascading effect, of cubes already on the board)

RATING: 8.5
First and foremost a mid-weight euro, BUT, it has a lot more historical theme than most euros. If you read the designer diary you can see how historical theme drove some of the rule details and the theme is present in a very detailed way in the production too: each of the many gorgeously illustrated building tiles is an actual historical building in Quebec City.

The game design is innovative and the alternative strategies are appealing to think about. There is a spatial "network" aspect, an area majority aspect, and a "construction of buildings" aspect. But add to that two overlapping layers of optionally helping others on their buildings: for an ability perk, and for investment in the area majority. And on top of all that there are special ability cards and event cards. And then finally there's arguably the most original mechanic in the game, a winner's perk of cascading down to the next area majority zone of influence.

08-07-2014 - Meh, I didn't love it.  I think we were playing it wrong though, and it does still have that going for it.  Perhaps if I play correctly I'd like it more.  But I just wasn't attracted to it.  I thought it looked bad.  There are so many games to play.  Not sure I'll play this one again on purpose.  It was interesting in that you claim buildings you think everyone will want - but you won't be able to use them yourself.  I've never seen that in a game and it was pretty fresh.  But still, the art is just so bleck and the game play wasn't that engaging.  6, and that might be a bit generous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game surprised me, because when I read about the cascading mechanic, I thought that would surely lead to some runaway leader issues. But, amazingly, the placement of cubes and flipping of buildings leads to a good balance in the corner zones and people play effectively because they know how dangerous a cascade is. Yet, I've done well even ignoring the side zones and instead building up my powerful major region during a century, or just concentrating on gaining victory points through the blue leader card. Great tension between you getting prized real estate, but then your opponents getting the bonuses. 

Three games in, all of them tight and thrilling, and I'm still eager to play again. A little on the long side and definitely prone to AP. Have not played with the events, have not played 4 player.

Update: Summer 2017. This is always the game I yearn to play, and whenever I visit my friends in Boston, this is a definite game to bring and play repeatedly. Sure, analysis paralysis creates 3 hour games. But they're so intense and satisfying! Friends, however, do not like the events (at least, the negative ones). My favorite game currently. 8.3 -> 10

RATING: N/A
Very interesting game.  It's very much an abstract cube-pusher, but there is a lot of subtle interaction.  The open question after one game is how varied the strategies (at least within an century) can be.  I suspect we did not use the leaders to their full potential.

RATING: 7.5
Took a  while to figure out the actions but once you do the  game moves pretty fast. the game would benefit greatly with a cheat sheet summarizing the benefits from aiding the buildings / use of leaders and scoring at the end. although this will surely be unneeded after a couple of plays.

I think this game + such a cheat sheet makes a recommendable gateway game.

A couple of days after playing it my feelings are mixed. the game moves at a good pace but you do not have a feeling that you accomplish  something. 
Games for me have to be fun or give me that feeling. this is somewhere right in between; for now my rating of 7.5 stands but it is likely to drop.

I like it but am slightly put off by how the actions play out, and it can be frustrating when yours don't get picked. This is to say that the game can back you into corners.

I do need  and want to play more to see how I can control my fate better.

RATING: 7
Area majority has never been an interesting mechanic to me, but Québec combines it with worker placement in a clever way. The values of bonuses for contributing to others' buildings change constantly with the situation, workers active, workers left for the current round etc. so there is a lot to keep an eye on. 2-player game works really good too, and is actually a tougher game of timing than the "regular" multiplayer game, since both players have control over the neutral architect's movements, and can exploit it in their own scoring and bonuses gained. Too early for me to say anything about replay value, but so far I'm impressed and enjoying learning the little subtleties involved.

The "theme" is pasted on just about as brutally as the hideous "districts" are superimposed on the otherwise good-looking board. Don't believe the "60-90 min." on the box, play time is usually about twice that much.

It's a very dry euro style game that mastes no sense with the theme. There is so much variable that it is very hard to predict what is going to happen. It's also a visual mess and it is very not color blind friendly.

There is only 1 good thing I found about this game is that like in Caylus, people can help you to gain some benefits. So if you have the right gaming group, you could end up with players advertising their buildings like "Invest here, it's good for you" Or "invest in my building and I'll invest in yours".

But if you play with a serious group of players and do not have that thrash talk, it could be completely boring.

An odd one, this. It was a lot of elements that shouldn’t really work together, but somehow do. There’s sort of worker placement, sort of area majority, and an interesting balance of cooperation and competition. The theme is the historical development of Quebec, but you’ll have to take their word for it; it’s largely an abstract cube-mover. On paper this shouldn’t have done much for me, but it was pretty neat and engaging.

It is a simple action selection game where on your turn you can put out an architect to build a building.  You can contribute to building a building which gives you a special action depending on where it is on the board.  You can also select a leader that gives you a special ability.  The interesting mechanic is how the scoring happens at the end of a century.  You score different zones and if you "win" that zone, some of your scoring tokens move to the next zone that scores.  This is not the only way to earn points, you can also earn point by building building and creating building zones.  It is a very unique game.  It has a family and advanced mode for scoring.  I would say that the family game is family weight and you can play it with kids.  Once the kids have the mechanics down you can move to the advanced game.  

It may be a bit abstract for some players taste, but I really liked the game.

A mix of Area control and worker placement, the nice theme about building the city of Quebec through 400 years feels totally pasted on like most worker placement games. The mechanics are actually interesting, including the cascading effect, however the end of game scoring based on large building zones feels totally random at the end of the game. Players will pick buildings hoping that other players will build on them thus giving them points, this is compensated by the end game scoring I suppose, but in later rounds no one wants to build on other player's zones so the game becomes a bit boring.

Unique mechanics of cascade scoring. Love the struggle of both trying to erect buildings near your own for end game scoring yet also in areas that entice other players to help you complete them.

Choose your building locations wisely, workers can be hard to come by if you get low. Pay close attention to how the cubes cascade from one region to the next.

Lots of good decisions to make.

It was an ok experience, the board looks horrific in my opinion, which lessen the flow and the mood of the period (1759).  The game mechanism, on the other hands, are truly innovative, but a little too much going on at the same time for it's own good, in my opinion.  

Nonetheless a must try if you want a good Euro with a real history behind it.

This is an area control game, themed after the development of Quebec from 1600. You use your architect to attract other players to play on your building, which makes the building more valuable. However, at the end,  one main grouping of adjacent buildings count for scoring, while your other buildings score less. The area control part comes in when cubes go to different zones, and every cube scores a point. The new idea in this game is the idea of cascading: if you have a majority in a zone, then half your cubes, up to a maximum of five, can go to the next zone to score. 

You also get additional actions if you play on an opponent's building. 

There are lots of choices to make, when choosing your additional actions, or deciding which building to start. It's a fun game, and it tends towards the 2 hr mark. Rating may go up slightly with more plays. There are many possibilities during the game, but you do need a balanced approach when scoring your VPs. I'm also looking forward to trying this game with the event cards.

Although the theme may be unappealing to many, the mechanics in this game are extremely interesting. Basically, you need to provide other players an incentive to give you a bigger advantage. The cascading of VPs into the next categories also provides a unique scoring dynamic, which may allow an underdog to pull a big move to steal the win. This game is definitely different and has been severely underrated in my opinion. However, although the available actions are simple, the symbology may seem a little complex and the game board visually looks heavy.

The waterfall scoring for places of power is awesome. The contention of putting your workers on someone else's building, thus potentially giving them more points, or moving your own architect and thus not increasing your building size. I like this one a lot.

I finally read the rules for Québec. A geekbuddy said it reminded him of Hansa Teutonica, which is what caught my attention, but I do not see the similarity, either mechanically or spiritually.

---

Oh man... I wanted to like this. But if I were to ever go full-Barnesian and label a game a drab cube-pusher, this would be it. Every turn gives you some reward for your effort; different decisions result in only the tiniest of optimization opportunities, measuring in theoretical half-points. Scoring at first appears innovative and unique, but any Real Gamer can easily brush aside the wispy curtain of opacity and directly calculate the mathematical effect of each particular action. 

In addition, this game desperately tries to impress you with it's historical theme, right down to the dates of events portrayed on the random event cards. Each building in the game is a real Quebec building constructed during the relevant century. The only problem is: none of this has ANY influence on actions you take in the game. The beautiful buildings are flipped over at the start - I couldn't choose to construct Château Haldimand if I tried. And once it is constructed and flipped over, the art is covered by the player's VP token. And the districts, which are so important to success, and historically themed and named, are only named in the rules. On the board it's, "I'll do this thing and that thing," not, "I am going to influence the Jewish District so I can shift my power base from Religious to Political."

Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

RATING: 6
It's got some interesting deviation from the usual going on, which is generally a good thing, but its downside is that at its core, you're relying on other people to score. You open a building, which has three slots. If another player deposits cubes in one of the slots, they get the building benefit, which is usually to add cubes to one of the scoring areas but could be other stuff like getting more cubes or various ways to score VPs directly. If you go to a slot in your own building, you don't get the benefit, so that's generally not good. The more filled slots, the more building VPs you'll earn for it at the end of the game. And the faster they're filled, the faster you can open up another building. Of course if no one goes there, you'll be helping other people complete their buildings and helping them get VPs, but you'll be missing out. So you need to choose which building to open very carefully. And hope that people don't king-make against you. On the flip side, there's a continual trade-off on your turn about getting the benefit of the building vs which scoring area your cubes will go into when the builder declares the building closed (most in an area is better, as per usual) vs who you're giving building VPs to. In a competitive game, I'm not a fan of this game style because your result often seems too dependent on other people's play, whether it is or not in actuality. While the downtime isn't too bad, this continual decision point always has people pondering the tradeoffs, so it's not exactly a fast game either, and it probably goes a round (20-30 mins) too long for what it offers, given each round is much the same as the previous - do buildings, get cubes out, score cubes, repeat. How this has any relationship to Quebec at all is totally beyond me, which is another negative. Call it "Abstract Euro" and leave it at that. I didn't mind exploring it, but it also feels explored after one play.

Got this game when it came out and played it a few times. There are some good ideas like the cascading mechanic and literally watching a city grow before your eyes. However, it doesn't have what I would call "staying power". It is just not interesting enough to withstand repeated plays. In fact, it has been so long since I last played it, I forgot I still owned a copy!

This is a fantastice Euro game with some really fresh mechanics that I've not played in any other game.  The "cascading workers" in the zones of power is really neat.  It's also something you have to keep an eye on, and also something that can gain you a lot of points!  You send worker out to buildings to both gain bonus actions and influence in those zones of power, but, you are also giving other players potential end-game points when you do that.  Then there are also Leader cards that give players unique, and strong, abilities each round.  And also event cards each round that change the game up a little every single round.  Lots of brain crunch, lots of fun!!

RATING: 5.5
Based on one play: The mechanics do not seem to flow well together and the board design makes it hard to see all the possibilities. You place cubes on the board in an attempt to complete buildings, but to get bonus actions you need to build on other players locations (with the exception of some of the special powers). Then once completed, the cubes used in the buildings move to one of five locations which will trigger an area majority battle at the end of each round. The powers do not appear to be equal and it gets frustrating to be stuck with one for a whole era.

RATING: 7
Quebec is one of those competitive games that involves a lot of teamwork--players propose buildings to be built, and then try to entice other players to help them construct those building tiles with tiles' cube requirements and special abilities.  You'll get end-game points for your network of connected buildings as the architect, but the builders will get special abilities and have their cubes sent to one of four area-control regions for used cubes to compete for in-game points.  These area-control regions have a hierarchy: the winner of each region will get to send some of their cubes to the next region down the line to get a boost there.  It's all very interconnected and works well.

Quebec feels like an older game than it is. The rules seems a bit creaky at first, and the muted color palette is a little funny.

This is a really interesting area control game. Like in Co2, one player starts a building and the other players put cubes on it, which will give you more points and give end of round scoring advantage for the players who helped, but unlike Co2, the mechanic worked here and people felt the benefit to themselves was worth the points for the other player.

The four big corner areas are colored in the same way the buildings are, so when a building completes, the people who put cubes into the buildings add them to the corner area that matches the building. At the end of the round each of those areas get scored 1 point per cube you have, and then the player with the most moves some into the next corner for them to score again.

The colors are a big garish, but they are effective in identifying which buildings effect which areas. It's a chaotic and fun open information area control game, and the abilities of the different buildings when completed give great twists and turns along the way.

We played the "Complete" game, three players.

One of the ugliest board games I've seen in awhile. The artwork itself is attractive. The lattice of circles superimposed on the map is is really ugly. This is unfortunate and ironic considering that Quebec City is arguably one of the most beautiful cities in North America. Of all the faults in this game, I think this is the one that made our only game a lacklustre experience.

This game is a cross between tile laying, area majority, and worker placement. The tile laying part involves trying to build the largest contiguous group of tiles on the board. Each tile is adjacent to a space indicating a special action. This is where the worker placement comes: when a player wants to build a tile on a particular space, other players can place workers on that space and use the special power adjacent to that space.

The area majority part involves what to do with all those workers that are placed on spaces. When a tile is built on a space, all those workers on that space are sent to one of four zones for area majority scoring.

My friends and I did not feel compelled to try this game again; the complexity of mechanisms in this game does not offer a corresponding depth of strategy. There are two main ways to score points: building a large contiguous group of buildings or exploiting the area majority mechanism. The process by which one goes about doing them are not compelling and very fiddly to accomplish.

Typical of Ystari games--sinfully dull and ugly art direction, exceedingly dry gameplay, and a totally lack of connection between theme and mechanics above and beyond what is even typical for euros.

That said, this isn't a terrible game, it's just not a very compelling one.  It tries to be a light game, but it has so many ways to get players in scoring positions, that it can get bogged down in AP. For a game that is ultimately light fare, that's not a great attribute to have. 

Also, the game's dryness and abstract nature run counter to using this as a family/gateway type game.  I can't imagine this game going over well with the casual set. 

Might suffer from a rich get richer problem as well.  Someone in our group was concerned that the cascading rule was the area where that might be problematic in this, but it's my belief that the end game scoring is more symptomatic of this, since players are awarded bonus points for building a high number of adjacent buildings. Since these score anyway, why should players get an additional reward?  Would have to play more to see if this is an actual problem, or if it's balanced by the game's co-op mechanisms.  My hunch is that it isn't, but I'm not a number cruncher so take that with a grain of salt.   

Anyway, there are just so many better area majority games out there that even the few novel twists this game has--which are no great shakes anyway--just aren't enough to elevate this game over classics like El Grande.

Wonderful game of building Quebec. Use your architect to build but other players will want to contrubute to get the buildings benefit. Gain influence in different areas; religious, political etc which will convert to points at the end of each phase.
Has the lovely element of : getting rewards = helping your opponenets!
Also the cascading 'influence' scoring makes it important to get a strong presence in the right areas.
Randomly selected event card for each of the 4 phases give a variety to each game.

There's only a few small quirks keeping this from being a truly great game. It seems there are rules in place to keep player scores close to one another until the very end of them, which makes finished building chains -extremely- important. 

I love the tension in picking leader cards. You can get the benefits immediately or you can wait for an opponent to grab first and earn free workers for waiting. Event cards are nice to keep things fresh and prevent points from getting too leveled out. 

Overall:
There's a lot to love about Quebec. I find it works best when you include ALL of the advanced cards. Pay close attention to end game points and you'll have a better time.

Usually I don't care too deeply about whether a game is deeply themed or not.  Maybe I'd like this one better if I felt it matched up with some sort of theme. But I really am just putting cubes on a board here.

Or maybe I'd like it better if the graphic design was less opaque. Two plays in, and I still feel like I'm translating a crappy French novel into Klingon. I prefer to not have to ask repeatedly, "What does this do?".

I will play it again if asked. My gamer pals are gung-ho for it. But I will play for them, not for the game.

I think of Quebec as "inoffensive area control". Yes, you are jostling for establishing buildings on the board, but it almost always befits you more to contribute to your opponents in order to get some sort of bonus ability. So, you are assisting them in completing their structure, but there is some incentive to do so. Maintaining this balance is an interesting puzzle. I wish I could try this game out more, but there are somewhat quicker, less convoluted area control games that I would rather play.

Basically it's El Grande with a twist. There is a nice mechanic of figuring out which buildings the other players are going to want to use the benefit most (at least early on - later you pretty much are focused on taking the buildings that are connected to your largest cluster). The area majority also resets every rounds, so you don't have the build-up of lots of cubes in each section like El Grande.  Definitely worth checking out to give a fresh life to area majority.

While I do like the chaining of getting points based on the categories and the interplay among the players to help each other out a little bit based up on the bonus actions that you take, but it does seem to take a little long and the point scoring is just indirect enough that I'd rather play a more straightforward area control game instead.

Quebec works pretty well aparently and it came up as one of the good ideas of this year. The cascade efect on each scoring can be a blast if used properly by every and each player because if only one player uses it the game gets too easy for that player. Components are cool enough but the map is very uggly. Almost absurd! Still, it's a keeper!

I'm the kind of guy that needs theme in his Euros.  I'm not saying it needs to have dragons or spaceships, there just has to be thematic reasons for the mechanisms.  This is why I love [thing=31260][/thing] and despise Stefan Feld.  Quebec had absolutely no thematic justification for anything.  It was the epitome of pushing cubes to get victory points.

The mechanisms weren't terrible.  An interesting concept was that you unlock actions by "constructing buildings", but only other players can take the action you unlock.  And when you take the actions of other players, they get a benefit from it.  So that was kind of cool.  Another interesting concept is that there are 5 different regions that score points each age that score in a certain order.  Whoever has the most cubes in a region gets to move half of their cubes to the next region.  So, there is a cascading effect where you might be able to win 2 or 3 regions in a row and score a lot of points.  Cool concept.

In the end, none of these concepts were groundbreaking enough to justify the complete lack of thematic justification.

The mechanism for gaining victory points at the same time you are giving victory points to your opponents is interesting.

This is an interesting area control game where the areas you control give special benefits to other players if they help you develop them. And building anything gets you cubes into the majority fights that happen at round end. There is a constant struggle between how much does your move help yourself and how much does it help someone else. Throw in some role selection for spice. It's a little bit of an odd mish-mash of things going on, but it worked for me. I enjoyed this quite a bit.

About [thing=91984][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=91984][/thing] is a game the passes by 400 years of building the city of Québec. And there is no better way to represent this than adding cubes to circles, then send these cubes to other circles, and score some few points in the middle and much more every century. You can almost feel the maple.

Anyway, [thing=91984][/thing] mixes work placement with area influence. For most of the time, players will be adding cubes to help build things (and activate the place to do some other action), or starting new buildings (to gain more workers and gain some points, while also sending the workers there to the related area of influence). [thing=91984][/thing] isn't the most intuitive of the games out there, but is hardly one too complex rules-wise.

This meant that, in spite of the explanation of it runs a little long (as it must encompasses all the different abilities of places, the powers of leaders, the cascade effect when scoring influence areas, and some other things), when playing the turns have, usually, a very nice pace, going briskly between players, as each person has one action to do each time, and although the action of a player can prevent you from doing what you were about to do, changing to something else isn't as hard as it could be, since, most of the time, there are plenty opportunities open on the board to be used.

Putting workers on other players buildings has a nice duo effect: it helps you, since it will activate the ability of the place, and, later, when the building is finished by the owner, it will send your cubes to influence one area, which is most of the reason of everything that is done in the game. But also you are helping the other player to gain points, as the more spots a building has covered before being closed, more points the owner will gain at the end of the game. I enjoy very much this sort of positive interaction in games, in which both sides gain, it is a matter of you gaining more to make it worth it.

Overall, [thing=91984][/thing] is very interesting, providing interaction, decisions, options and paths to victory, all wrap in a pretty unique game.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player has the cubes "on hand" and in the reserve. In each turn the player has 4 options of actions:
- Finishing a building and starting a new one (of course, at the start of the game, only start a building, without finishing other, is possible). The player takes 3 cubes from the reserve and put in on hand. All the cubes on the building go to the proper area of influence (religious, political, economical or art), accordingly to the type of building. Finally, the building token is flipped to its completed side and the player puts a marker to indicate its value at the game's end;
- Add cubes to a building: the player puts the required number of cubes (from 1 to 3), from the ones on her hand, on the building tile. She can then activate the ability of the region the building is in. It is possible to put cubes without using the ability (this normally happens when a player adds cubes to her own controlled building);
- Put a cube directly on one of the four areas of influence - not in the citadel of Quebec;
- Take a Leader card - the player also gets the a number of cubes to the hand equal to the number of already taken card (therefore, the first to get a Leader gains no worker, the second, gains 1, the third, two workers, and so on).

Each player does only one of these actions on her turn. Every one goes on doing actions until one of the two triggers to end the century happens:
a) All the buildings of a century are finished and a new one, from the next century, is started;
b) A player has no more cubes, both in hand and in reserve. In her next turn, after this happened, the century will end.

Once the century ends, a scoring of all 5 areas of influence will happen in a given order, that changes accordingly to the century, but always starts with the citadel of Quebec. Here is where the cacade effect takes place - the player with the majority of cubes in an area gets to send half (round down, and up to a maximum of 5) of her cubes to the next area of influence. And yes, this can make the same player have the majority in the next area as well, and the effect will trigger again. In the last area of influece of the century, there won't be a cascade effect, of course, but, instead, the cubes there will go to the players hands, which is good to allow the use of abilities of buildings and getting ready to influence again more promptly, as all the cubes remaining on the other areas go to the reserve of the respective players.

All the cubes in the areas of influence, regardless of majority, will score 1 point. The cascade effect only helps players score cubes more than once.

In the end, after 4 centuries, after the cubes in influence areas are counted (for the fourth time in the game), there will be another scoring: player will gain points accordingly to the buildings finished - the bigger unbroken chain of buildings of each player will score fully (using the numbers on the token), and the others buildings of them, not connected to the chain, will score equal to the number of stars on them. Finally, the player with the most prestige (points) will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Many decisions are done throughout the play. Not only which of the 4 main actions to pick from (usually will be adding cubes and starting new buildings), but also subsequential decisions. For instance: ok, you decided to finish your current building, as it is full. This is a decision, and on its own it can already have some complexity to it: if you don't finish it, the cubes (probably from other players) will be stuck there, unavailable to them for as long as you keep that building unfinished. Also, the timming might not be right, as this "only one action per turn" makes everything become priorities: yes, finishing the building now will allow you to take a good spot to continue a chain of buildings, but also will prevent you from adding cubes to a building that might be full when your turn returns, therefore you might not be able to do the ability it allows, which can have a big effect on the majorities of an area. Or start a building, while good for you in the long run, might benefit others more, as usually you can't use the ability of a building you own, so starting a new building is basically giving the others more opportunities.

But ok, you decided to finish your current building and start a new one. Then comes the subsequential decision: where to start a new building? As I mentioned, you want to make a big chain of completed buildings to score more at the game's end, however, you don't really want to start a building with a too useful action of the others, but can't pick a truly bad one, as there might not be interest in helping you build and you won't be able to gain points from it, or too few points. Or maybe you want someone else to open a building in a certain place, as you want to use the action there.

The same is valid for the adding of cubes to a building. It has an immediate effect (the ability of the region of the building), but also, once the building is finished, the cubes there will go to an influence area. Normally you will want to make use of buildings also thinking in gaining the most of it when it is finished, in order to score better once the century is done. Therefore, even a worst ability can be more interesting to be done, if it will allow you to send cubes, say, the economical (yellow) sphere of influence.

As you can see, [thing=91984][/thing] offers a lot in the field of decisions, and the cascade effect in the scoring of influence at the end of each century adds a layer of decision without adding complexity, and it works very well.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Allows for a lot of positive interaction between players, with just some light blocking as negative ones;
- Many and layered decisions to be made throughout the play;
- Small downtime, as players do a single action each turn;
- Unique cascade effect, which give more weight to decisions;
- A rare area influence/control with almost no bash the leader.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Big box, making it difficult to move around;
- Colors and the way the buildings are set up make difficult to see, at a glance, all the information needed;
- Plays best with 4 or 5, numbers that can be hard to achieve to some;
- Several areas abilities, the unique scoring and powers of leaders make the explanation a challenge to be done quickly and for everyone to remember the information given.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Did I mentioned already the maple? Yes, maple leaves brushing your feet and clothes, in a the afternoon breeze. The smell of syrup, and wood being cut. The sounds of construction and life happening all around. A bustling city becoming greater. Well, none of this is truly in [thing=91984][/thing].

[thing=91984][/thing] isn't a thematic game, nor even tries much to be (it maybe be more using the Event cards), though the Leaders cards do have the nice touch of adding names of persons of importance of the time, and the way the order of the spheres of influence is resolved at the end of each century has a link to the shifts that happened on the grand scale of the city itself. Still, you won't feel that while playing.

The feel of [thing=91984][/thing] is a mechanical one - you think in plays considering benefits, what others are doing, what they can do, and who is influencing where and with how many cubes. You are in a constant struggle trying to keep the number of cubes on hand and on reserve in proper number, as cubes on hand serve to activate buildings and they go from the reserve while using the abilities of regions - so you need to have enough cubes in both places to do well. There is also a fight for influence, specially due to the cacade effect, and for places on the board, due to the chain of buildings. Most spots are coveted and timming issues are pressing for the whole game.

In the end, [thing=91984][/thing] isn't the tightest of games, not for the work placement part - there is usually several good places to use -, and not for the are influence part - all cubes will score, regardless of majorities. While this doesn't add up to make the most tense, cutthroat, hard or stressful game one will find, it does make for a nice experience, one with little AP, few moves to hurt others, with a good pacing and filled with important (yet, not brain-hurting) decisions. Very recommended game.

More complex and therefore not as streamlined as El Grande which is still my favourite area majority game. What is better in Québec is the mechanism of weighing helping others out against the colour and action it gives you and them.

As a Canadian, I was very much interested in this game. And while it was good, it won't make my buy list. Players allocate their "architects" onto buildings, which then can be allocated cubes to build them. If you help build buildings where your opponent's architects are, then you get some extra benefit depending on where the building is on the board. When buildings are completed, the cubes are placed into the corners of the board, where they earn points, and majorities get extra points. So, the difficulty lies in that you give your opponents points when you help build their buildings, but it gives you points for for majorities.

It's unfortunate that the game's gorgeous artwork doesn't show very much, as everything needs to be colour coordinated for scoring, and that colouring overpowers the art.

(after 1 5p game) - we played with a random setup so there were some situations where tiles were not getting "contributed to" as one would expect.

Overall, a little deeper game than I imagined, but after a round (100 years) it was all clicking and I was looking forward to a second attempt to improve my initial builds, etc.  It is a cube pusher, but it does offer a unique experience.   

Caution - there might be some AP issues.

Quebec has some interesting mechanisms that remind me a little bit of the same style of games like Age of Steam, Container, Hansa Teutonica, or Upon a Salty Ocean.  There's some passive-aggression, some careful manipulation of resources, and most of all, you have to manage the timing of your action so you can best benefit from them.  It has a certain unforgiving nature, but it also provides multiple paths to follow to accumulate points.  It has very little randomness to the game, and is a nice 120-minute, angst-ridden game.  In other words, this is SO my kind of game.

Rather abstract city building. Four rounds of area majority. Buildings give special actions, and helping to build for other players' buildings add to the majorities.

Medium to heavy weight Euro with a theme that will appeal to Quebecans or Quebecians or Quebecites or whatever they refer to themselves as if other than Canadian.  Beautiful tiles and board that's essentially about area control.  After multiple plays including with the event cards I've upped my rating on this one.  It's a sleeper/hidden gem that shouldn't be missed.

Very good game that is a combination of worker placement and area control, but sort of neither.  

First play was with three and it played very well.  Might be slightly more chaotic with more, but I suspect it will play well with 4 and 5 too.

it is too hard to read what's going on in this game, it is too convoluted, fractal, and the map is horrendous with lurid colors. almost blinding. you build there to have an action in another place to put cubes in a third place that fall into a fourth space if you have enough but the next turn everything's changed. too much for too less

Ieder jaar weer wordt het voor spellen lastiger om origineel uit de hoek te komen. Een spel als Québec lukt dat aardig.

Spelers bouwen aan de stad quebec (whats new?), maar dit gebeurt vooral in harmonie. Spelers kiezen gebouwen uit die zij willen dat gebouwd wordt en de andere spelers mogen meehelpen. Deze medespelers krijgen een speciale actie om te doen en de bouwer krijgt uiteindelijk punten voor het gebouw. Ook tussentijdse puntentellingen zijn aardig gevonden.

Dit spel is zeker een spel waar ik weer zal aanschuiven als het op tafel komt.

A fun, sneaky, jockeying-for-"area"-control game, which is driven by a lot of non-controlling placements on controllable buildings that have been started by those who want to control them.  There are enough cogs moving in this game to make it [pleasantly] difficult to manipulate perfectly, which means there are nearly always sneaky avenues to accomplishing something helpful.  The scoring-with-a-half-life of the "domains" is delightfully unusual (the closest I've seen to this is [thing=12188][/thing], which cycles through the areas for tie-breakers, but doesn't pass along cubes), and manipulating it can be of great importance, but every bit as difficult as manipulating the other mechanisms of the game.

Gameplay is quite fast, considering all that delicious complexity, allowing Québec to deliver an excellent gaming experience in the time advertised on the box — a rare bit of verity!

The entire board is composed of colored spaces for the buildings.  During setup, the buildings are shuffled, and placed on the board randomly by color.  The only differences between the buildings themselves is the era (1–4) during which they are available to be started; their position determines what ability they confer to contributors.  …but the era number is a huge factor in play, because you want to maximize your biggest chain of buildings.  More cleverly and specifically, you want to maximize the point value of your most valuable chain of buildings, so just flitting along for minimal points is extremely ineffective — for chaining purposes, anyway….

A brilliant game, which I look forward to playing more!

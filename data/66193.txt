But overall there is a huge amount of randomness.

RATING: 6.5
Not bad at all. While you can play this like "Just roll some die and place it somewhere", the inclusion of the worms tokens can make this a war of attrition, where players invest worms to skip a turn until one of them runs out of them. With two players, the control over another color makes for even more strategic choices when to roll which color to take up a space in a specific ant hill.

Juego de dados de Feld. Mucho mucho más ligero que otras de sus creaciones, pero también de los mas divertidos

Partidas bastante rápidas con lo que no llegan a cansar y se suele jugar revanchas; muy familiar, de hecho si teneis niños también lo pueden disfrutar.

Muy recomendable

[ESP] Un entretenido filler con dados. Creo que la baja nota que tiene es simplemente un castigo para Feld que suele hacer juegos absolutamente estratégico. Pero como las cosas hay que evaluarlas por lo que son y este es un filler encuetro que es uno que cumple con todo lo que debería. Muy bueno.

RATING: N/A
I really enjoyed the first play of this. We played 5 player and no one had played before. It had some interesting strategic choices. The only bit that felt like a Feld game was the final scoring, otherwise it seemed like any number of other silly dice games. Not a bad thing, I would definitely break it out any time we were killing time between meatier games. Also the dice are really shiny and I ended up with an extra black die and the black die are supposed to be white, but that's neither here nor there. Also, the black, green and blue look similar when placed on the board near each other.

Not a top 100 for me

Juego muy sencillo de dados. Cada jugador dispone de cinco dados que debe colocar en tres posibles tarjetas. Una vez que colocas en una tarjeta. Las tarjetas tienen varias filas con un número variable de casillas y una vez que has colocado un dado en una fila, el resto de los dados que coloques en esa tarjeta irán a esa fila. Cuando todos los jugadores han agotado sus dados, se evalúa quien tiene la mayoría de puntos en cada tarjeta y se lleva el premio asociado. El siguiente en las mayorías también lleva puntos. Además, cada tarjeta premia un determinado número (cada dado con dicho valor que coloques te otorga un "gusano", que sirve como comodín para poder volver a tirar un dado o como un punto al final de la partida). Por último, algunas celdas también contienen objetos diversos. Quien más objetos diferentes tenga al final de la partida, se lleva 10 puntos. Además, por cada pareja de objetos iguales, se puntúan cinco puntos. Es un juego sencillito (chorrijuego, que diría kintaro), pero está entretenido para rellenar esperas.

Mar 2011:  This certainly is a luck-heavy game, but not TOO long to really be a problem.   The boards and graphics are cute, and the trade-offs between token tiles, worms, re-rolling, and choosing columns with lot of dice are interesting.  

Still, in the end this is all about who rolls the most 5s and 6s.  No amount of strategy can beat a player who has an abnormal number of good rolls.

Initial rating is a 7.  No interest to trade for or purchase at this time.  Would like to play again though some time.

I must say, I was very skeptical of this one after reading the rules, but it turns It Happens was a pretty neat little dice-rolling filler.  There are more interesting decisions than I'd have though at first blush.

Basically, at the beginning of each round, you flip over three anthills, each depicting several columns of dice.  You roll a die on your turn, and add it to one of the ant hills, gaining resources for placing your dice on specific spaces.  The catch is that your first die in an anthill must go in the left-most empty column.  Once you place a die in an anthill, you can then only place later dice in that anthill in the same column.  So, each player can only place in one column per anthill.  This often results in a bit of a game of chicken, as you usually have your eye on certain columns that contain the resources you want, but you need other players to claim the left-most columns to allow you to place in a column that is further to the right.

In addition, at the end of each round, the player with the most pips in each of the 3 anthills gets a bonus.  So, if you claim a column with only 1 space in it, you are less likely to win this bonus than if you claimed a column with 3 spaces in it (and thus the opportunity to place more pips in that anthill).  So, it's a balance of getting the resources you wanted, while also winning the pip majorities if possible.

There are some other little things that make it interesting as well, like the opportunity to make re-rolls or pass your turn for a cost, but those are the basics. 

Overall, some interesting decisions that weren't apparent at first blush.  It's also simple enough where you could easily play it with your family, but with enough interesting decisions for the gamers to enjoy.  Good stuff!

This is probably the lightest Stefan Feld game in existence.  It is easy to teach/learn and plays quickly.  The artwork is whimsically funny, only wish there were more cards to choose from to add variety to the game.  Another "go to" game for my kids.

My only wish would be that there were more cards available for more replay value.  As is, seeing the same cards every time isn't all that exciting.  The dice rolls add enough variability to make the game worthwhile.

I created a microbadge for this game: [microbadge=35287]

Players take turns rolling one of their five dice, and committing it to an ant-hill.  When all dice are placed, totals are resolved and victory points are handed out for first and second place on each of the hills.  Bonus symbols can also be won, as well as worms.  Worms grant re-rolls, and are worth a point each if held to the end of the game.  Symbols pay out for diversity and sets.  Fun, fairly mindless game - rolling high should help you do well - gets harder if you don't!  Cute production and graphics.

I picked [thing=66193][/thing] up as a freebie from Queen on KS.  And I am glad I did too.  It's a lovely little game which once again reminds me to ignore BGG ratings.  It is a dice game which can be played by ages 7+ yet has enough interesting decisions to satisfy most Gamers, whilst also allowing aggressive play to hamper your opponents should you wish to.  Yes high dice will help, but it ultimately is dependent on good tactical play rather than a bunch of sixes.   Stefan Feld does it again, and this time proves he can design intuitively simple games.

This one is interesting. There are restrictions on where you may place your dice and so this on will work best with the full compliment of players as other wise large sections of the board are completely inaccessible, which is a shame if the items you are attempting to collect occur in that part of the board.

Otherwise this is a simple enjoyable dice placement game where by you score points for rolling certain numbers, score points for most pips on a board section and there are bonus points for collecting worms and other items that litter the board.

I had read some good things about this game but the name turned me off.  When I saw that Michael Menzel was the artist I bought it.

It is an appealing, filler/family game that is light, but still has enough strategy that I enjoy playing it.  It is only 20-30 mins, and I think it plays well with 3, 4, and 5.  Just a 5 minute rule read and you're ready to play. (We set it up, read the rules, and played two games  all within an hour.)

It is a dice game, but clever placement and manipulation of the dice, provides some balance against the luck.  

I really don't mind that the theme doesn't hold together, because I like the play.  But why is an anteater excited about finding an old shoe or broken glasses in a termite mound, and why would they be there at all?  Why and how did an ancient Egyptian, Gold Pharaoh or a large stereo speaker blasting out music get there?  Are termites bigger, and stronger, and more cultured than I thought?

"It Happens...." is an obvious play on words that doesn't really fit the game.  So I have to think it was named this just to get people's attention, and generate sales because it is supposed to be funny...like little kids in the movies saying bad adult words.  This game is for ages 8+, so I think they could have used a more appropriate title--and saved the name for a real, down-on-your-luck game targeting young adults & older.

This is another game where the box, although not large, could have been so much smaller.

I do like the game, and it's a keeper.

If you're buying this because It's a "Stefan Feld" game, you will be disappointed. If you buy this because you're after a "family friend (except for the game title) dice rolling bit of strategy lite and easy hey It's not actually a bad game I think I would play it again cause It's pretty quick and cute and there is something in it" game, you might be surprised that you like it. Rated a friendly 7 (19/2/13). UPDATE: Rerank to 3 SF (7.164, April 16). UPDATE: Call me shallow, but the title is annoying (A kids game with an implied title of Shit Happens??).  Plus, not a great fan of the ant theme and that it is a family game I will probably not play it as a family game.  So, sold (Rating 5.724, Jan 17)

Stefan Feld, the family game designer?

That's more or less what we have in It Happens. (FYI, I don't understand the title at all- it's innocuous, and doesn't seem to relate to the game a bit)

This is a game about optimizing die placement tactically, and hoping you capture enough VP's to win.

There are a set of 12 cards for dice, and each has a number of blocks to place dice.

Each card has a 1st place and 2nd place award of differing amounts, and players place dice on the card with the highest sum of dice winning it.

The cards also have pictures in some of the blocks, and placing a die on a picture either gains a token for set-collection or a token which can be turned in to re-roll a die one time.

Naturally, the theme is anteaters and termite nests. (??!?!?!!)

It has a Haba-like appeal with the deliberately cartoonish artwork, and the length of play to roll and assign the dice through 4 rounds is still quite quick, so you probably won't lose a little one before the game ends.

It certainly seems like Feld was just experimenting with dice placement here; it got so much better with other Feld games like Macao, Castles of Burgundy, Bruges and Bora Bora.  

But this is a family game first and foremost, and it was never intended to burn your brain.

This was intended for young people to have a game to playable with their families, to have a game gamers can take out and play quickly with friends, to fill a niche in the German game market for original games that the US took up with pop-o-matic games that re-hashed older traditional international games.

I don't find it offensive, problematic or anything but a quick little game for mixed company, and I think this would fit pretty well with gamers looking for games to play with young children who can add several integers (up to 20 or so at most).

It's a friendly little match to try to put your dice best, and may the smartest and luckiest anteater win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(12/31/2013) Comment based on one play.

An uncomplicated Stefan Feld design that uses dice rolling probabilities for a humorous, fun game, that seems to be the precursor the Castles of Burgundy.

It plays sort of like Yahtzee, but you only get to roll your five dice, one die at a time. On a player's turn, they must allocate the die to one of three play areas. There are twelve play areas, coming out in groups of three, for four "rounds". Each play area has five or six columns of spaces for the dies, and may vary in number of rows from one to four. Some spaces have symbols, where, if covered, the player receives a token with the symbol on it. Collecting sets of two or more is 5 VP, while having the largest variety of all the players is 10 VP. Otherwise, players are competing on each play area by allocating the most pips. Each play area gives first and second place VPs, and bonus "worm" token for allocating a specific number of pips. Worm tokens are 1 VP at the end of the game, or can be used to skip turns or re-roll a die.

The theme is almost inconsequential, as it is about ants, ant hills, and aardvarks, but the artwork is well done and very funny. The oohs and aahs will come from the random die elements and allocations, which tickles the gambler in all of us. Aside from the heavy luck element, there are some meaningful decisions. Play is quick, and the overall length of the game is just right at 30 minutes for a light filler that works for gamers and non-gamers alike. I rate it a "7".

This is a light game, but it might surprise you with its decisions. At a glance, the rules seem so restrictive that you might imagine that there are no choices to be made. But in every game I've played of it, nearly every decision was difficult. When to place on a card, when to go for points, when to go for items, and when to go for worms. Even when to reroll a die or pass (by spending a worm).

Totally random dice game, but pretty enjoyable at that. I'm notorius against dice games, but since the winner and loser are chosen completely random, you can't be mad if you lost. Tough luck. Might even play again.

Stefan Feld has designed a lot of great games. This isn't really one of them. There's a cool concept here of dice placement with different placement options every round, but it just feels half-cooked, as though it was published before the usual development process of play-testing, tweaking, etc. could take place. This stays in my collection because I'm a Feld completist, but I'll happily tell you that it's his only less-than-great game.

Little, easy filler game. Has some easy to understand tactics (like using worms to pass to see what other do and to get in a diffrent pillar). Don't need to play it all the time but every once in a while is fine
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not your typical Feld. Sure, it has dice rolling, but the dice aren't used as randomizers and high rolls are distinctly better than low rolls. There are some decisions to be made, such as on which of the three cards to place your die (do I tank on this card or fight on, do I grab a symbol chit), whether to use a reroll token, and whether to pass and make another player go first, but those decisions are fairly light.

If played with the full player count and the right group (probably including some younger players), it could be an enjoyable game, in the vein of a slightly more simple Las Vegas.

This game has deceptively simple rules, "roll a die and place a die." However, you can only place your dice in one column/ant hill on each of the three cards AND on any given card you must place in the column furthest to the left. Dice placement can potentially earn players worms, or let them pick up artifacts that are used for set collection, and ultimately contributes to area majority. Die manipulation is limited to rerolls which are limited to the number of worms you have on hand so thoughtful die placement combined with risk assessment/management are the best bet.

This game has a surprising amount of hard choices for a light dice-rolling game. It is a delightful family game with a completely unique theme and humorous artwork.

RATING: 5.5
It Happens... is OK, but it will not displace any of my favourites.
The players take turns placing a single dice at a time onto cards that show varying scoring opportunities. Some spaces provide points, others give tokens that can be spent as re-rolls. There is little strategy, and few tactics beyond simple probability assessment. It is a children's game, but can be played by adults as a filler.
The cards are bright and have cute illustrations, and the dice are standard plastic d6s (although the green dice in my set are so dark they look black except in sunlight). The box is about 10x bigger than it needs to be.
All in all, it is OK. Not going to surpass [thing=41][/thing], [thing=45][/thing] or [thing=15818][/thing], but pleasant enough.

RATING: 7
A pleasant dice rolling game with an element of chicken. It's a bit slower than the usual dice game because each player only gets to roll one die on their turn. They then must decide on which of the three boards to place it, and there's only one place on each board they can put it, or spend a VP to re-roll, or to delay a turn, hoping someone else will take the space unwanted allowing you to go to the next space. You're aiming to have the most pips on a board or to land your dice on spaces that give items in order to earn bonus VPs at end-game. So it's simple - hope to roll high, choose one of three options each turn. Your decision will be affected by what other players roll and what they place. It moves fast-ish but still feels like it has a decent decision to make each turn, always a good thing. It goes the right length to make it decent filler territory.

Componentes engraçados, uma temática muito original e uma arte perfeita, num jogo no qual o número máximo de opções a tomar são 3 e muitas vezes somos robots com uma única hipótese de escolha, o que é uma sensação sempre desagradável; felizmente o jogo é rápido e suficientemente diferente para se levar com agrado. Suspeito que tenha sido uma das inspirações de Rudiger Dorn para a criação de Vegas, não acham?!

This is an interesting filler type dice placement game.  At first there doesn't seem to much decision making but then it clicks a bit.  Not a deep filler but is entertaining.  Played with two which was okay but  this game is at its best with 5 but with less is still fun and this one will probably get played more as time goes on.

(+) Quick to set up, explain and play
(+) Nice artwork
(+) Offers some tense moments and some strategic thinking

(-) Bad die rolls kill the best of strategies - the game suffers from randomness, but in a light title such as this this is only a minor problem
(-) I'm afraid 'Perudo' ('Liar's Dice') is a similar game, but it offers better player interaction and a better experience compared to 'It Happens'

Got a brand new copy for $5! Another Feld to the collection.


2plays: We played two games back to back, and that is always a good sign. Played with 2 and 3 and boths counts are fun, but I suspect this game is at it's best with 5. The dummy player does work very well with 2 though, the artwork is hilarious, pieces are nice, and everything is just charming, but there's some nice little decisions to make. A filler we look forward to playing more of.

Decent game, but not what I want in a filler-style dice game. This is just too slow: it's a little annoying having to just sit there and watch everyone else take their turn (since dice are rolled at the beginning of your turn, and [i]then[/i] you must decide how to allocate them). I do, however, like the basic game play, which creates some tension as players try to force each other to take the less desirable columns on the anthill tiles. At the same time, they must balance getting the tokens they want against earning the end-of-round bonuses.

Neat game, but just felt too slow.

--- Summary ---
Each round, reveal 3 anthill tiles. Each shows a unique set of columns of different heights, showing various icons.

On your turn, roll one d6 and add it to one of the tiles:
- if you're not yet on tile, you must choose leftmost empty column
- once you're in a column, can only add to that column.  
- if you cover an icon, get the matching token (if available in Supply)

At the end of the round, the 2 players with the most pips on each anthill score VP. Then, draw 3 new anthills.

At the end of the game (when all anthills have been played), score VP for your sets (1 of each type of token; or 4 of one type). Most VP wins

A very pleasant little dice game that has some touch choices.  I like how you have to manage your timing and also your die rolls.  I'm thinking this may be a "more the merrier" game, but it works pretty well with 2 as well.  I like the use of the extra dice to act as a dummy player.

As a simple unassuming dice game this this goes a long way with its charm. Kids and nongamers will love it, gamers probably not so much. Gamers should probably check out Pickomino instead. But if you are looking for something beside Yahtzy this is an excellent choice. A few more choices and a lot more fun! And maybe best of all, you dont roll, reroll and reroll again! Instead you use your dice to take area control over the cards. So there you go, area control with dice.

If you're curious about this, don't let a reading of the rules put you off.  What may seem overly simplistic and restrictive in the rules actually holds some tense tactical maneuvering and timing choices.  The options the worms give you (reroll or pass!) elevate the game.  As in [thing=13642][/thing] and something more recent that's slipping my mind, procrastination is much more powerful and interesting than it seems at first.

Not a bad game, but there are better ones that do basically the same thing.  The secret role selection was interesting, but perhaps a bit unbalanced depending on what the other players do.  I'd play it again.

Update:  I appreciate this one more and more.  Great depth/length ratio.

After three plays I have made up my mind... this game is not worth playing. It's too fast and chaotic for the strategy game that it wants to be. I had fun when we were all discovering the game together, but when a group with varying experience of the game plays, the bad aspects come out. It also has the dumbest name in recent years. Too bad, because it is a very nice looking game.

Count me in as another fan of Castle for All Seasons. I bought the game based on a read of the rules and noticing the nifty role mechanic. But after playing a few times, I'm really liking the choose your scoring while playing aspect - very fun and feels very unique. This game physically *looks* like Pillars (a game which I really don't enjoy) and has unfortunately a very similar theme. But in fact, plays much different and much faster. I still would like to explore this one alot more.

1st play: I came into this with very low expectations after picking it up for $5 used at the End Game auction.  I was very pleasantly surprised - The actions took a little time to adjust to, but the game played really quick and has an interesting twist on hand management.  This feels like a combination between Stone Age and Concordia, with building various building types on the board while trying to guess which roles other players will pick.  Really cool game and the artwork is excellent.

2nd play: A very good game that plays quickly and has great interactions, solid decisions to make and solid mechanics.  The balance is strong and trying to predict what roles other people will pick is great.  I describe the game as a cross between Concordia and Stone Age.  Knowing when to play Master Builder and pull your hand back is an art and can decide the game, where in most games, getting your hand back is a dead turn.  Really cool.

I'm not convinced about this one.

For me it feels like the final scoring section ripped from a more fun game.

All the mechanics and bits work fine (and the shaped goods really are a neat addition) but I just didn't feel it.

Plus, it feels weird taking something off the board when your build - I demand 3d buildings!

Worker placement game? Yeah, been there done that.
Role selection game? Yeah, been there done that.
But it is the combination of these tried and true elements that makes A Castle for All Seasons such a wonderful game! In terms of role selection, it's my favourite game of the genre, light years ahead of Citadels and Puerto Rico. In terms of worker placement, it pounds Stone Age back into the stone age. The level of player interaction is quite high, and the luck level is non-existent (unless you're playing the winter version of the game). Due to the simultaneous role selection, I believe it is impossible for anyone to master the game, and rest assured, no matter how many times you play it, you WILL make mistakes! It plays very differently between two, three and four players, but it also plays well with any number of players. One of the most graphically beautiful boardgame I've ever played.

There are a number of weird design choices in this game, including something simple like not indicating the order in which cards activate on the cards themselves; a simple number would have made this much clearer. Gameplay in summer is somewhat underwhelming. Hoping the "advanced" winter version is slightly more interesting.

RATING: 6
The art is beautiful but it is Michael Menzel so there's no surprise there. The game looks good on the table with lots of resource pieces and cardboard punch outs for each location you build. But for what seems to be a simple worker placement this one does get over wrought in its own mechanisms really quickly. You don't just build the building you take control of it in some way. It is difficult to explain. Granted the game play isn't difficult or fiddly to keep up with like in Caylus. But it just bogs down in a few mechanisms that seem to be made complex just to make them complex. And complexity for complexity's sake is something we hate in games.

Very playable game.  Quick rules, even quicker play.  I technically appreciate the art but would appreciate more contrast for usability.  I don't think it brings much new to the table.

I'd be willing enough to play it again if asked but feel no instinct to request or own it.

Gorgeous, simply gorgeous, artwork and components.

The game is so simple, but the trick is to figure out what you're supposed to do, what is the point? It took a couple games to figure it out, and to realize that it plays much differently than the game appears it should (for those who've played worker placement type games).

Not bad, but also not easy.

Initial rating, based on playing once. _Very_ tentative rating, this, which could swing up or down quite a bit still, but for the moment I'm rather hopeful.  There seems to be a lot of subtle strategy here, with careful timing and watching your opponents being absolutely crucial. Resource limitations due to "exact change" can be agonizing (in a mostly good way?). The game doesn't really seem to have enough rounds to properly build up anything engine-like, either, but somehow it still works quite well. Felt short, even if our initial game lasted quite a while.

Essen '08 purchase.  To GS Apr-11.

After one summer side play colour me disappointed.  I won comfortably in a three player game with my opponent's understanding the game much better than I did.  I played no workers into the resource areas, but made frequent use of the Master Builder which gave lots of points as my opponents were necessarily in building mode.  The two games I was reminded of were Cuba and snap!  I am not a great fan of Cuba either as I am not convinced of the value of the buildings in that game, with my last three games one on a no building strategy.  I sense the same type of imbalance here.  As I bought a copy of ACFAS I will play again to will pay again to confirm view or otherwise.

Second play, used the winter side.  I insisted we finish the game when one of my opponent's suggested we give up halfway through and move onto something better.  Enjoyed the second game slightly more, but don't envisage playing again.  Too much luck and ‘take that’.  The game has only twelve turns with four players, which leaves the impression that the game is only half finished, literally and in the game's development.  A shame for such a nice looking game.

Beautiful board and components by the same illustrator as Stone Age and Cuba. Plays quick but ultimately lacks the depth and replayability of other similar games.

Szerintem ez a játék simán megüti a Stone Age szintjét, meglep hogy ennyire alul van értékelve. Ráadásul a szerencse szerepe is jóval kisebb... Egy kis Citadellás szerepválasztás keverve egy kis Stone Age-es nyersanyaggyűjtős-építőssel (kocka nélkül)... Nagyon jó az összhatás! Elég sokféle győzelmi út kínálkozik, szinte minden épülettípus nyerő lehet. Fontos bizonyos kártyák jó időzítése, talán túl sok is múlhat 1-1 döntésen.
Kétoldalas a tábla (tél, nyár), szép, igényes és még egyszer: szerintem alulértékelt.

I bought this game because I have a couple of weak-points: I love worker placement and wonderful artwork. When I read the rules I was a little disappointed: this is not a worker placement game (it's based on role selection), and it felt rather dull. Anyway, the components are so gorgeous I had to give it a try... and I discovered a good game, perhaps limited in different strategies, but very enjoyable!

Race to gather VP.  No direct player interaction.  Can affect the way others play by building bits of the castle or not building.  No way to prevent others from building other than resource denial.  Resources seem easy to obtain either through Stone Mason or Trader.  Nothing to write home about.

Played with 4 players.  Game is better with 4, but it just seemed like there are games that do the same stuff better.

Great design where all seemingly independent mechanisms interlock in a beautiful way. Every turn you have to choose your path taking into account many variables and weighing your different needs against each other. This makes for a tight game full of agonizing decisions. Add the beautiful design and the added variety when playing the winter version and you have a winner in my book.

Played once, and we said after that session that it was a good game. But we we never felt the nedd to get back to the game. Three months later and we still have only played once.

Mechanics-wise there is nothing wrong with the game though, on the contrary it is quite nice. Weird.

I had trouble wrapping my head around this game of worker placement.  Also, I was annoyed at the psychological element of guessing when other players were going to build (and playing your master builder card).  If you guessed correctly or got lucky, you could get as many as 15-20 points from the master builder, but often you would get zero or 5 points.  Need to try again and just do stuff instead of turtle-ing and collecting resources (that I ran out of time to build with anyway!).

Yawn. Nothing new here - pretty board (although I prefer stone age) but that's about the limit of the appeal. Typical euro, blind action selection (which are pretty abstract), then resolve the tactical puzzle to turn cubes into points. 

Exact count to purchase was a pain, and the value of stuff annoying (no '3', 1,2,4,5 ... why?) whole thing was tedious. And blind action selection isn't my favourite mechanic, you have to gamble on what your opponents are doing, but there's enough options all of similar worth to make the 'guess' just that. Luck out and you can steal vps or get resources cheap (and maybe screw up their building plan), get it wrong and you can't,

Overall - dull. Playing the game, just felt I'd much rather play stone age for this sort of worker placement, collect resources to buy vps type of game.

For a game that is a rehash of old mechancis, CfaS is outstanding.  The balancing act between money and building resources mixed with the hidden role selection makes this an excellent game.  What's more this scales very well from 2 - 4 players.  I've heard complaints about 4 player games not giving you enough actions, but I don't see it.

A game with simultaneous card reveal, where you show what you want to do in the game turn. Is fun to try to outguess the other players choices.
Plays quick, and has a good tension towards the end.
Can be a bit rough on new players as there is a minor problem to get up on the same points as others have if you fall behind.

Hooray, another castle building game.  With resources.  And little meeples.  Whee.

On the bright side... it plays fast, which is nice, due to the simultaneous play of cards.  

The game itself offers numerous paths to victory, so it's certainly replayable with different strategies.  The "master builder" bluffing also adds an interesting element of interaction to the game.  

Overall, a solid game, although I wish that there were a few more different cards that could be played to aid in replayability.

I first played Castle for All Seasons at my gaming group, with 3 other players.  And it was good - very, very good.  Some chaos, due to the simultaneous role selection, but not too much, and the game definitely had the feeling of "way more to do than can be managed in one game."  Turns go very fast in this one - basically, choose a role, then execute, then repeat x 12.  Given that a role will likely get you resources, money, OR allow you to build, you can see that building many buildings in a game is not an option.  Instead, you have to try to gain an edge by sharing points with others, seeing who is building what and possibly cooperating.  Good stuff.  It was an immediate must-buy for me.

Well, once I bought it, and played it with 2, I was somewhat disappointed, mainly because the 2 player game makes you use 2 roles per turn rather than 1.  So the feeling of "too much to do" not only disappears, it is totally blown away.  By the end of a 2 player game, most of the buildings will be built - period.  You will have no problem collecting resources.  Instead, the game becomes about timing, blocking, and optimization.  Is that a bad thing?  No, not at all.  In fact, once I adjusted my expectations, I'd still say this is an excellent game with 2.  It just doesn't have what I love about the game with more.  We tried playing with the 3 player rules, which does work, and gives the original flavor, but we discovered that it simply unbalances the game, as certain buildings become too weak, and so certain "correct" strategies emerge.  The winter side adds some spice for 2, whereas it is probably unnecessary with more.  This is a great Euro, and I  recommend it for 2, but if you get a chance to play with more, go for it.

Rating might be a little unfair, it might be better than that, but it has (in my opinion) the flaw of being both a major AP trap as well as being pretty random, as role selection can be very swingy. It might be a game that simply has to be played on a timer for the simultaneous selection portion, but even then the buying/paying actions can be work to figure out. Anyway, I think it's well put-together, but I think it's just too reminiscent of other, shorter, much superior games (San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, Pillars of the Earth, Aladdin's Dragons) to be worth the investment.

This is pretty much just another get stuff to build stuff and score points for it game, which is fine, but I didn't particularly enjoy the way this one works.  The game is very swingy due to table randomness, which is a factor I typically don't enjoy much.  The case is pretty rare when I enjoy the "everyone play a card face down, and then reveal them at the same time" mechanic.  Guess right on a card play and you're in good shape... guess wrong and it can kind of blow.  Factor in that you only get 12 card plays per game, where you only make incremental progress each turn, and the swinginess just doesn't balance out.  Also, the scoring for some of the board positions can be kind of crazy depending on how things play out.  It's cool that there are multiple paths to victory, but the correct path in this one can't really be planned for.  You pick a route and hope the other players help you out enough to win.  The game still manages to not be terrible, but that's about it.

RATING: 6
Relatively simple role selection game where one has to balance the resources on gets between building for points or money. There are different ways to score points at the end besides building stuff, but you have to dedicate workers for those options. The choices you can choose from during the game are pretty clear and one of the things that i noticed is that the game is mainly about being able to guess what others are going to do (and take advantage of that). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a solid game, it all works, however, it shows that too much parasitic conflict is the same as none. The scoring is so intertwined that most of the time thinking out how any move affects the other player's scores isn't worth it and you just go for it hoping that it earns you more points than them.

RATING: 7
(Based on 1 play with 4 players) - Very satisfying light Euro. Could see the rating rise with more plays. Not a lot new here but everything meshes together really well and feels smooth. The thing I like most about the game is how fast the endgame creeps up on you. You get very few actions per game which means you have to make the most of them. Good stuff!

Another excellently done worker-placement game with incredibly beautiful visuals.  This is a hidden gem that I think has not had as much publicity as it deserves.

I nice cross-blending between worker placement and hand management, with a fair level of "guessing" about what your opponents will do.

2 player plays uniquely different than with three or four players due to the double action each round, AND the fact that the "Trader" will most likely deliver at least two goods to each player each time he shows up.

An excellent game.

They ought to have named this [b]Stone Age Sans The Fun[/b].

The game has is just too ripe for AP. You can not plan ahead because you are losing and receiving resources while you wait your next turn. When it is your turn you can only buy things for the exact amount and have to use three different resources. 

I also find that this game goes counter to my theory that any euro game is better if you re-theme it with zombies. However, not even rotting man-eating zombies would be able to save this one for me.

This game has garnered several comparisons: Cuba, Stone Age, Pillars of the Earth, Mission Red Planet, to name a few.  While this game, like many others, shares mechanics with other games, I don't think it is similar to these.

There are workers but they are not used in the usual sense of worker placement - they aren't placed, resolved, withdrawn, and available for placing again each round.  Instead, they can be placed by the Trader (to help gain resources) where they will remain until displaced by another player's or placed into a building.  Once in a building, the worker is there to stay for the entire game.

Game play is basic: accumulate resources, build buildings, decide when and where to place helpers for end game victory points.  That said, there plenty of things that help this game stand out: the interaction between player cards, the relation between buildings and the helper locations, limited resources, and the inevitability of helping another player.  

Much different with 4 than with 2.  It's harder to accumulate resources and more difficult to manage building in a way that gives others an advantage in placing into copper spots.  The Master Builder earned more points.

Pretty much combination of many mechanics. At first when I read the rules, it seemed blend pretty well. After playing it though, it's clunky. It's harder than any other game to see the immediate result of your action, thus forming strategy is more difficult.

Most of us after playing it didn't really know what could we do differently. I mean, we didn't really catch why we were lost, or worse, why we were winning. 

It's not a bad game, especially the board is absolutely gorgeous. The rule are simpler than Caylus, but the strategy is harder to form than Caylus. Very not intuitive game.

Targetted to be a quick filler.  You play an action card to collect resources, collect money, build buildings (VPs), or buy helpers (VPs). The game seems to end just as it begins to get interesting.  But that doesn't mean it is short.  The first play is longer than you'd expect because of the requirements to build a building.  You need exact change + 3 different types of goods.  Also, when a building is built, it opens up "helper" spots which all do different things.  So the first play takes awhile to read and understand all the options.  Could go up with repeat plays.

At a high level, it's so similar to Stone Age that I can't see owning both, but I'm happy to play either.   This has the same artist, same feel, and many of the same bits from Stone Age.   Instead of dice and worker placement, there is role selection (which works exactly like Mission Red Planet) which allows gathering of various resources and building the tiles on the board.   There is a little bit of worker-placement here for big end-game scoring, which can make the game a bit swingy perhaps.   But, it has the advantage over Stone Age in that it is a fixed-length game.   If you like Stone Age, you should try this.   If you don't like the dice in Stone Age, then you should still try this.

The Master builder card really rubbed me the wrong way.  I hated that players could get a ton of points on a turn simply by guessing when other players were going to build and by doing nothing else.  I hate the leeching of points. There are so many situations that occurred dealing with this card that infuriated me.  When 1 player plays master builder and 3 players build, or when you have no choice but to build and give points to a player you don't want to, netting you fewer points.  And of course, when you play master builder and everyone with lots of resources decided not to build.  If it was just a few points, it might be fine, but it rewarded so many points that made it seem like a lot of play hinged on the guessing of when to play or not play the master builder.  So, the combination of the euro-like play with a double-think hinge just didn't work for me.  

On top of that, even though it's only supposed to be a 45 minute game, the restriction on the 3 resources for building leads to a lot more natural analysis which extends the gameplay beyond it's welcome.  I basically felt I would work really hard to figure out optimal collection and building strategies only to have points leeched from me, so the optimization wasn't worth the analysis.

There is no luck in this game other than who is the starting player. There is chaos but that is mitigated if you are good at deduction. I consider this to be a good thing. Everyone has the same set of cards in their hand at the beginning of the game. A round will begin with simultaneous card selection. These cards are resolved in a specific order like Citadels and Mission: Red Planet. Like Mission: Red Planet, there is a card that let's you get back previously used cards. Deducing what card to play based on what you think others will play is at the heart of the game.

Resources have a set building value of 1 (sand), 2 (wood), 4 (clay), 5 (stone) and there is a 'wild card' resource as well (silver). Resource acquisition is strange. You can commit a worker to gather resources when a card comes up (which is somewhat like typical worker placement games), but you can also acquire opponents resources or take them from a communal fund. The direct interaction comes from the fact that, you can actually kick out opponents workers from resource gathering, under certain conditions. Also, when you lay a certain card, your opponent has to sell a resource to you if they played a certain card and for just one piddly coin. Resources are used to build buildings and when you build them you will get victory point or money. Some buildings when built will open up spaces for workers. If you pay to take up those spaces it will help you during end game scoring. 

This game is not long and not overly complex (but there are better games to use as gateways games such as Stone Age). Despite that it has a lot of tough/interesting decisions to be made packed in it's short time frame. It's not the most elegant and some might say it's contrived. Some might also say it's a bit 'mathy' in a similar way that Power Grid is mathy. I can agree with this, at least, for the first few plays. The thing about it though is that after repeated plays you'll generally remember good combinations of resources for specific buildings. You have to keep in mind that you will always need 2 sand, 2 stone, or a sand and a stone for every building you wish to construct. The reason for that is sand and stone have odd numbers for building values and all building values for buildings are even numbers with a minimum of 3 different types of resources needed to make a building. Also silver does not count as a type of resource because, it's 'cashed in' for any one of the other resources. It's kind of contrived because the building cost to construct a building must be paid exactly by the resources, meaning not only do you not get resources back if you were able to overpay, but it's against the rules to overpay with resources.

The set up of the game is pretty fiddly.

I think ACfaS is a decent game that is pretty short and doesn't feel like a generic worker placement. I wouldn't call it innovative either, but I like the mixture of mechanisms in this game.

I played this one a lot more than my interest level would indicate, and that's because I was traveling for work at one period and would play this on BSW to pass the evening in the hotel room. At first, I found it quite original with the way you reserve VP slots that you won't know the value of until the game is over. However, some are great! and others suck! such that that consideration wore off quickly. While, there is a bit of deduction and gamesmanship in selecting your roles, there's also a fair amount of random screwage which can produce some pretty big swings that are not necessarily due to good play. After a few plays, I'd seen all there was to see.

Rating represents 5 plus 1 for the fact that I got several plays out of it.

I particularly like the components in this game; the tiles covering the buildings, the resources, the board and the cards are all of excellent quality.  There are also some nice ideas, but at the end of the day this game has little to offer that you won't find in another resource management game.

There are some interesting facets, such as choosing the right action at the right time and making sure you plan and time all of your actions correctly.  At the end of the day, Castle reminds me of a cross-bred [gameid=120] and [gameid=24480].

That isn't a bad thing; what is a bad thing is that there are so many similar games that do this - [gameid=34635], [gameid=24480] and [gameid=18602] for example, though they do allow different ways of resource-gathering and action selection.  Having said that, it won't stop me from playing again; Castle is a fairly good experience marred only by its competitors.

RATING: 8
I had this quite a while before playing it - the rules put me off trying to teach this one.

It's actually quite a simple card play -- take action game.  Each player chooses an action card and plays it simultaneously.  the actions are then carried out in a set order.

There are resources to collect, which in turn allow sections of the castle to be built, each giving points or money as a reward.  
Following building, workers can also be placed, at a cost, into areas of the castle which, all give victory points at the end of the game.

Ha már ennyi pénzt öltek Menzel grafikáiba, meg a kétoldalas táblanyomtatásra, akkor kitalálhattak volna hozzá valami minimális szabálymódosítást. (Pl. más az ára, meg a körvégi tudása az épületnek). Persze ez kicsit szőrszálhasogatás, mert ha csak egyoldalas lenne a tábla ugyanezárt az árért, akkor nem lenne gondom. :)

This is a good solid Euro.  Nicely produced bits, lovely looking board and includes expansion.  It seems to have multiple paths to victory which is nice.  And yet, it is not completely compelling.  If it were a Beatles song it would be Nowhere Man. So, I would play again, but probably not suggest it.  It's a 7 in a world where you only really replay games of rating 8 (April 2013). UPDATE Still not compelling enough to take off the shelf and yet still a keeper - weird (Rating 6.821, Jan 17)

A clever little game, that rewards players who can play their cards more efficiently (both for their own gain and to interfere with their opponents' plans) and can manage the delicate balance between resources and money in a very short number of turns.
The game gives a lot of satisfaction to those who grasp the multiple strategic possibilities at hand and put them in practice. People who don't like too many calculations could be turned off by the building mechanics, but all in all it has a light-medium weight.
One special mention goes to Michael Menzel's breathtaking artwork (one of the most beautiful boards I've played).

A game similar to Cuba in many, many aspects: cards with complex roles, buildings erected for resource cubes, Michael Menzel artwork, pre-set number of rounds etc. It doesn't have the elegance of Cuba but is almost as good and entertaining. One big advantage is that the rules are somewhat simpler (although the manual isn't the best of its kind...).

I played it and had a good time. Not great - good. And maybe I'll play it more often in the future. Who knows...

The game grows on you after the second try. I've improved my rating as a result. It does, however, seem a bit short when playing with two or three players: it needs the full complement so that the traders and other interactive cards have a decent effect. I would add three or four more turns to the length.

RATING: 8
This game plays much quicker than I expected and much quicker than most other worker placement games.  Being quick is neither good nor bad it is just surprisingly quick and worth mentioning.  I played two rounds with 4 for the purpose of getting the basics of the game.  Then I played a two player game.  In the two player game one must keep aware of the worker action order as it is more critical as you play two workers in each round.  Very similar to "Mission Red Planet" in terms of mechanics, in my opinion you do not need both in your collection.

This game is over before you know it.  I'd like to play it some more as I don't think I have a good feel for it yet.

A Castle for All Seasons uses a theme we've all seen before and mechanics we've all seen before. That said, it uses them very well. This is the game I wanted Pillers of the Earth to be.

The relatively short playing time is filled with tight, tense decisions. There are multiple paths to victory and you will never be able to pursue all or even most of them.

Medieval theme where you trade resources for points; I don't think the expression just another soulless euro was coined when this came out, but it fits the bill quite well. Normally, this wouldn't be a red light for me, but it doesn't seem to be enough progression in the game, in est the game rounds all seem to be too samey for me and it become boring at the end of the game. There is role selection in the game where all players select one character from their hand (each player has 8 cards to chose from) and reveal them simultaneously. I don't think that it works particularly well because there are not enough interesting options, but can screw a player. But if you take that away from the game, there isn't much left.

If I wanted to play a similar game, I would go for Havana instead. While I haven't played that game it seems to do the same thing, but has more game to it in less play time.

Played once at Essen 08. Nice artwork, in the vein of Pillars of the Earth. The game itself is one of resource management and worker placement but with a twist in that on their turn a player chooses a role to enact and only some of the roles allow a player to place workers, while others let them gain resources or build buildings etc.

Nothing new essentially but I'd be happy to give it another go.

Another game of collecting resources and building something for victory points.  Has elements of Stone Age and Race for the Galaxy/San Juan.  The overall game is nicely designed and works pretty well but for me it is a bit too frustrating.  My main problem with this game is the mechanism of secretly selecting a "role" and then simultaneously revealing the outcome.  This works well in many games but here we have some kind of "rock-paper-scissors" problem: A mason only works good if someone else has selected a worker.  A masterbuilder only works good if someone else builds something.  A worker is nearly useless if one or more other players select a mason.  I realize that many players actually enjoy this kind of mechanism but it's simply nothing for me.  Maybe I'm just too stupid for games which require me to guess what other players are about to play this round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have been pleasantly surprised by A Castle for All Seasons, as the well-worn theme had me fearful that the game would play much the same as many other games utilizing a similar storyline.  Fortunately, the blend of mechanisms -- both old and revised -- gives the game a fresh feel, and the choices it requires and tension it evokes in such a short timeframe are substantial.  I’m happy to see the company supporting the game with additional event cards, as this will insure it will continue to make regular visits to my gaming table, whatever the season may be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The worker placement part is minor, but there is something from "Stone Age" in the way resources are used for building, and the role selection is borrowed from "Mission: Red Planet". Nothing new, and the gorgeous art by Michael Menzel probably makes it seem better than it really is, but it has a good and solid combination of old mechanics. Maybe the interaction between some cards gives too much weight to guessing, but it's still a very entertaining game.

RATING: 3
Completely awful.  Recycled role selection mechanism tacked onto worker placement mechanism.  Throw in needing exact change to buy things and you have a real loser.  The theme is..... building a medieval castle!  Holy cow, so original!  

Honestly, it is like a game designer lost a bet or something.  I can't believe it has the rating it has, but I guess if this is the sort of thing you like, then another highly derivative version is what you want?  

UPDATE:  I haven't played it again, but I feel compelled to update and make note that as the hype engine died down on this one, its rating actually settled into something reasonable.  The early high rating of this game was a great example of the board game "cult of the new" hype engine gone mad.  The game is a derivative and bland piece of crap which worked, but had no soul, originality, or anything interesting.  

It came out when people were pitching tents in their pants every time the phrase worker placement was used, and had an inflated rating for a time because of that.  

I stand by my rating of a 3, as this is a game I will never play again.

First of all: this game plays very differently from Pillars.
It's fast, quite cerebral with 2 and very fun with 3 or 4 players.  Guessing what others are up too is not that difficult, the comparison with Citadels is adequate.
Strategy/time ratio is really good.
Also, the second board feels like an extension *included with the base game*; it is not needed to enjoy the game, yet is a nice and subtle change from the base board.
A nice change from games that feels unfinished and that get fixed with the extension.

RATING: 5
A very 'tight' game with only 12 turns (for 4p), that is reminiscent of Stone Age, mixed with Princes of Florence. It mixes the mechanics of worker placement and resource gathering, along with building. However, the plays must be ultra-efficient, like in Princes, since you only have a limited number of moves. The interesting mechanic is the blind selection of roles that are on the cards, which dictate what you can do, a la Race For the Galaxy. It's quick at 45 minutes, but it is a challenging 45 minutes. Many things to consider. Will have to try this again. Initial rating: '7'.

Update (02/10/13): Okay, it's been five years. I still think about the 12 tight turns, but I don't care enough to seek this game out anymore. Dropping to a '5'.

My first reaction to this game was that there are so many choices, and having read/heard nothing about the game going in, I was lost as far as strategy at first.  The game isn't that hard to catch on to, although I'm sure more plays will make the intricacies and interactions of the cards more clear.  I can say this, it appears that there are definitely several paths to victory.

I don't usually like short games but this one manages to:
-- not be just a card game
-- not be too repetitive
-- have quite interesting decisions (e.g. second guessing the other players based on what they have in front of them)
-- have a good theme (in this case really helped by the great components)

And I really love games that have 'events'.

My one annoyance is that both sides of the player aid card are important so I had to keep flipping it over (i.e. about 96 times during the game).

Seems lik it´s over too fast, you don´t feel like you did anything at all. Only one action a round is not that much to do. A lot depends on guessing what the other players will do this turn, sometimes resulting in turns in which noone can do anything. 
It looks very nice and plays out in about 60 mins. If someone really wants to play it i could be talked into it again.

Take the 'blind action' mechanism and mix it with lots of very unthematic mathematical calculation and you'll have a good idea of what this mediocre Euro is like. Yet another get resources, build and grab the best spots game that's been done better so many times before. Don't play on the winter side of the board as the winter action cards throw a lot of randomness into the already unremarkable mix. Nothing here is for me, but analysis paralysis freaks will have a field day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels sort of "generic Euro"-y to me.  There's a bit of simultaneous action selection, a bit of predicting what the end of the game will look like, some rather abstracted building and the ability to gather materials.  The rule about building with at least three different material types is interesting, but not much else is new or exciting here.  (1 play)

Turn order resolving duplicate cards can have a huge impact, and your opponents choices can add a lot of chaos to the game. Also, working out what resources to use when building something requires you to think/guess far ahead, which can lead to some long thinking times.

The alternative (winter) board seems like a missed opportunity. If you're going to go to the cost of printing it, it would be nice to see some more interesting rule changes.

A couple of plays with 3 and 4 players. Castle for All Seasons has the, by now, all too common theme of constructing a major building (castle, cathedral) in a middle-age setting.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Castle offers something a little different from the norm - the very modest playing time and the scoring mechanisms.

I played this four times at the WBC. It took four times of playing to actually get all the rules correct even though this is NOT a very difficult game to understand. Maybe the rulebook was worse than I first thought. Anyhow, after two plays I was done with the game. Then I saw someone struggling to read/understand the rules, so I taught him to play. Later he told me about a few of the rules that I had taught wrong and decided to give it one last shot with all the correct rules. I should have quit while I was ahead, I didn't need to play it a fourth time as my opinion didn't change a bit. It really is just a rehash of mechanics that we've seen before with a few new things that I just didn't find all that fantastic.

I really wanted to like this game.  The board is gorgeous and is brings to mind Pillars.

With 3 other players in the game the Master Builder is too powerful.  I did play it once 2 player and found it more enjoyable.

Many have grumbled that this is a melange of mechanisms seen before in other games, and there's truth in that. However, it's still a well-produced, fun, quick playing and challenging game balancing resource management and (in particular) character selection.

Very impressed with my first play of this game!  It's tough gauging an experience around one play but as I really started to understand the game in the later rounds I started to apperciate the subtle tatics surrounding it.  As mentioned many other times nothing about the game is terribly orginal but pulls many mechanics from games I love to play into a game not so bad itself!

**update

Well I've played this a few more times and I gotta say the last game did not go over with the group or for that matter myself all that well.  I'm going to try this one out a few more times but I'm strongly considering putting it up for trade.  bumped down to a 6.5

Good game, as this may look like a worker placement it really isn't.  You place your workers on the board to reserve VP for the end of the game scoring.

RATING: 6
Compared to the usual suspect Pillars of Earth this one is easier and quicker to play once you got through the various cards and options where you could place your workers. On your move you basically make only one choice of a card which happens for all players simultaneously. This central mechanism is close to Adel Verpflichtet or Säulen von Venedig but the relations between the cards played are less strong here with the exception of the Master Builder. This card can decide  the game in favour of one player if other players all choose to build on this turn. I'm not sure how much room there is for differing strategies as all buildings and worker placement areas are available to all players and most of the areas even have the same value for all players.

I like this game and stick by my rating of 8, although I ultimately traded it away.  

I like how the game plays; I like the turn phases and I like the decisions required to activate different characters at different times. I like the variety introduced by the Winter Cards, I like how the resources are allocated and I like how the building value of the resources can make it a little tricky to buy the building that you have your eye on (you can’t "overpay").

Where it went a little thin for us after a few plays is that the strategic paths chosen didn’t seem to differentiate enough.  It seemed that no matter what strategic approach we took, it all kind of evened out in the end. It is also possible that we just totally missed it...

Just like a summer blockbuster, you know exactly what you're getting in this typical Euro game.  Medieval Europe?  Check.  Castle-building?  Check.  Michael Menzel artwork?  Check.  Efficiency with basically interchangeable resources?  Check.

So, a terribly boring theme and recycled mechanics, but A Castle for All Seasons (if you only count summer and winter as seasons, which I guess we do in California) somehow takes the bland and makes it interesting.  I think it accomplishes this in two ways.

First, the simultaneous selection is a fun mechanism that I enjoy.  The doublethink involved is fun and it's so delicious to rack up a bunch of points for free with your Master Builder because your opponents don't have the time to waste to not build.  Which brings me to the second point - the speed of the game makes this much more tolerable than other similar games like Pillars of the Earth or Stone Age (with which this game shares almost identical artwork for certain resources).  I can see how some would say it is too quick, but I like the speed of the game.

RATING: 7
If this game were longer, I would rate it much lower, but despite how complicated it looks, it really just takes 45 minutes to play.

Players take turns selecting roles and building a castle. There is much similarities to Mission: Red Planet, where the roles dictate the player order and the cards can only be returned to the players' hand by a special role. MRP was better for me, more thematic, lighter and fun.

Castle for All Seasons is pretty good, but has a lot of rules for such a short game. Also, the math for building points was unique but quite irritating. The role cards would definitely have been better with a bit of text on it. I think with a bit more plays, I would appreciate the game more, but as it stands, for such a quick game, I'm not sure about the time investing spent teaching the game.

The cardplay mechanism is interesting, and the differences, however minor in some cases, between the cards make for some hard choices and multiple paths to victory. Love the coop-tition of some of the city spots. Love the small mechanisms, like the building costs and the trader, which are tricky but filled with decisions Also, the quick gameplay makes it quite interesting. 

Could use variable set-up however. As is, you could play the cards in the exact some order every game, if you think it's the optimal thing to do.

Way faster than I anticipated.
It stil leaves some nice time for planning ahead and a couple of different strategies, but I thinkit suffers just a tad from the "rushed" feel of the game.
The theme and feel of the game is Epic, and it's over too quick to be anything of the sort.
Well designed, however, and I am sure there are myriad strategies my groups have not even touched on in the handful of plays I have.

I cannot be certain yet, if it's near the top in its line...
Caylus>Pillars>Cuba>Castle...?

I do like it better, overall than Cuba or Pillars, I think.  Stone Age and Caylus are strong, however...I'm not quite certain yet...

Played once, 4 players.  Slightly disappointing.  Maybe I had built this up too much in my head, expecting a super worker placement game, but this had a couple of mechanisms I really dislike.  Specifically, a players worker can be kicked off their location pretty much at the whim of another player.  This annoyed me more than once.  Plus, I normally hate simultaneous action selection.  Here, it's not too bad, really, since you WILL get to take the action you choose, you may just not get to use it like you wanted.  I did like the mechanic, that each role can be used only once before the recycle mechanic must be selected.  I'd play again, just to be sure, but I'm not rushing to buy it.

RATING: 6
Decent worker placement game with a bit too much unplanned player interaction for my taste which can lead to chaos and inadvertent kingmaking.  The master builder cards and various reward spaces in the castle force people to choose whether to give players points or deny them and forgo their own plans.  Although there is some art to predicting others' plays and playing your pieces accordingly, there also seems to be a fairly significant amount of randomness.

Short. Simple. 

There are so few strategies in this game that once you begin to dominate one you've got a huge advantage. Get your foot in the door to what seems to be the only other strategy, and you've got a lock.

So let me get this straight: There's the tower strategy, house strategy, the "hope people don't place too many  helpers" strategy, and the "please god don't let people build too many buildings" strategy.

It's a total dud. Some of the bonuses simply don't pay enough. I mean, who exactly isn't going to try and play as many helpers as they can or build as many buildings as they can? Perhaps they're trying not to help people using those strategies, but then what are they to do?

I was a runaway leader when playing this and I can honestly say that 3 experienced players were left with a game that was not even as good as Stone Age. 

I know they're going for family style games these days but this one needed to bake a bit longer in the over before they served it up.

Solid euro--hand-management, using variable character powers to obtain resources and convert resources into points.  Beautiful board and art, well produced but not too fiddly.  I can't get over how pointless the 'winter' side seems, other than to show off more board art.  The six winter (event) cards certainly add to the game, but there was no reason to reprint the entire board on the reverse.

Rating after one play (rating may go up).

This game looks a lot like "Pillars of the Earth" and plays a bit like "Stone Age". It also reminds me of "Elasund" somehow, but I don't really know why.

It also has a bit of Race for the Galaxy in that you must choose your actions simultaneously, and if choosen properly (or luckily) you can benefit greatly from the choices of the other players.

RATING: 6
This game is everything I wanted it to be, from the beautiful and evocative art to the way it subtly evokes its theme. It sounds more involved than it is from a read-through of the rules -- once you start playing, it feels like it's over before you've gotten started (in a good way).

Every turn is a constant push and pull; you have to gain resources to use them, but there's the risk of gaining fewer than you expected. What everyone is plays is hugely important, and timing matters a great deal. You can plan ahead, but you have to stay flexible at the same time; missed opportunities hurt.

The gameplay is tight, entertaining, and, although simple, offers a lot of depth. The role selection mechanic is sublime, combining Citadels and Mission: Red Planet in a way that perfectly fits the game.

The game board is one of my all-time favorites. It's gorgeous, the vertical format is novel, and I love the way it feels like the castle is coming to life as you play. It's a board that errs towards being artistic -- usually a problem -- without sacrificing usability in the least bit,

I kept this for years because I loved the theme and presentation, but it never got played. Sold.

RATING: 6.5
I like this game. To be honest, it doesn't really fulfill a niche in my collection. I have at least a half dozen other worker placement games that do similar things. The primary draw in A Castle for all Seasons is the simultaneous card play. It's nothing revolutionary. Simultaneous revealing is not unique either. I can find that in Jamaica, Chinatown, Dice Town, Libertalia, Fresco, etc. However, when you combine those elements, offer some interesting building choices and feature great art (Michael Menzel) with quality components, you have a rather solid game. It's not sexy, but I like how simple the game is: pick a card, everyone reveal at the same time, and carry out actions in a certain order (think Citadels). It's fun and light, and if I feel that way after playing it with only 2, I can only imagine how much more I will like it with 4. 

Update 2/13/15: 

After a second play, this game has dropped quite a bit in my esteem. The scoring lacks balance, the card play is more random than clever, and the play time is too long for what it is. Having so many other games in this category that do similar things, but do it better, I don't know if I can justify keeping this one.

RATING: 6
07/14/09 Played a three-player (summer) game, once. There is strategy in this game. But there is also a *very* large dollop of guessing. If you can guess what character card your opponents will reveal each turn you're going to do well. If not... you'll fall behind. So if you don't care for that blind bidding/bluffing aspect this game may frustrate you a great deal, because it does have a large impact on play.  

The artwork in generally nice. Relative to the game's duration and its "lightness", the rules took quite a while to explain. Also I think they went a little icon crazy. Most were OK, but a few were not easy to figure out. Overall I think A Castle for All Seasons is nice, solid, Eurogame. It doesn't break any new ground, and is generally inoffensive. Probably a good fit for those still relatively new to German games. For the old pros - go with Pillars of the Earth. 

Some of the cards are lacking some text/icons (e.g. "max 2"). 

I look forward to playing the winter side of the board, to see what the event cards add.

08/04/09 A second three-player game; summer side.  04/03/10 Played a three-player game; winter side. I enjoyed what the event cards (that came with the game) added to the game.  10/09/10 Ditto.  02/11/12 Played a three-player game; summer side.  02/16/13 Played a three-player game; winter side. 05/10/14 Played a four-player game, winter side, with all 12 event cards. 12/05/15 Played a three-player game, winter side, with all 12 event cards. 03/05/16 Played a three-player game; summer side.

Very beautiful artwork from the same illustrator as Stone age and Pillars of the Earth.

The game play is quick and quite intuitive.  You select a card from your hand and play it with the other players.  You then resolve your "worker" and interact with the other players workers.  Ressource management is everything in this game.  

I had real fun playing it even if it was on a prototype board.

Update : Now that I own it, this game shows that a game can be quick to play and still a lot of fun.  I don't know for others, but I find the mechanism of role selection to be quite reminescent of Race for the Galaxy....which is a very good thing considering Race is my #1 game.

Not the greatest economic/worker-placement/city-building game, but not a terrible game either.  I always found it psychologically frustrating to build up resources and buy a building just to gain access to worker spots (most buildings don't count for any victory points by themselves).  There's just something that feels wrong about that mechanic, even though it works fine within the game.  We sometimes play it for a change of pace, but it's never the first thing suggested.

Fun Castle building game that feels different to the other games I've played with a similar theme. You build not only to score points, but to also open up scoring options that players have to invest money to take, and whenever you build you have to have exact value in resources and they have to be at least three different kinds, so you need to balance out taking higher and lower valued materials. Plays best with two players simply because you as a player get to do twice as much than when you play with three or four players.

I remember settling for this after I couldn't get my hands on [b][GameID=24480][/b] in several math trades.  My cursory research seemed to indicate that they were essentially the same but I was wrong, to say the least.  This is resource management with a dash of roll selection mixed in, but neither mechanic is done with any originality.  It's a "FrankenEuro," in that all kinds of attributes of these types of games are slapped together, and then seen if they can walk.  This one just didn't for me.

Better than expected. Reminiscent of Stone Age, both aesthetically and for the somewhat abstract way resources become points. Has a little bit of Citadels feel to it, in that you're trying to guess your opponent's role choices each round to leech off them or protect yourself. 

Very nice little game.

RATING: 5
Hmmm.

It feels familiar - I mean worker placement, it's not like that's unique. And yet the role cards ala Citadels adds a nice layer of strategy as you try to second guess the other players at the table. Good stuff, but still not as tight, focused or interesting as Pillars.

Me gusta este juego ya que mezcla 3 de las mecanicas que mas me gustan de los Euros: seleccion de rol, colocacion de trabajadores y gestion de recursos. Ademas tiene buenos componentes con un diseño grafico al estilo Pilares (el mismo ilustrador, Menzel) que hace que entre por los ojos. Ademas sus mecanicas funcionan muy bien.

A different type of a worker placement game. Instead of using your workers each round again, you assign them once and for all, and then play character cards to gain the materials you want, so you can build aspects of the castle.
Bluffing between the players for the character selection make the game different from others of the same type, but in the same time it may repel some players.

If you like blind-bidding games than ignore my comments - you may like this game quite a bit and that's fine. Personally, I HATE games like this where you choose a role and hope that the other players didn't screw you over. Too many times you can be hosed by another player choosing a role that affects you negatively, wasting your turn. Add to this that the design is terrible, doing everything in its power to make the game difficult to play and you have a game that I can gladly live without.

Collect resources to construct buildings, with lots of outguessing included. There are clever interconnections in the ways the resources move around, but otherwise there's nothing new or special here. The best part is that you get only 12 turns in the game (or 15 with three players), which means that you really have to think ahead, and that the game is very quick.

The English rulebook is a bit unpolished, but still quite decent anyway. There's a weird usability bug with the cards: The cards are always resolved in the same order, but still they aren't numbered at all. It's also difficult to keep track of which cards the others have played already, because the numbers are missing, and the names of the cards aren't written on the top of the cards either.

My first playing left me wondering that the game might depend quite a bit on groupthink, and that choosing the scoring places for your dudes is a combination of a crapshoot and a game of chicken. The game is probably more polished than that, but I'd rather not be having these kind of suspicious first impressions. I'll probably give this another try anyway.

EDIT: Tried another time with three players, and had to lower the rating. With only three role cards per round, the resources don't move around enough, and the gameplay feels lacking.

On first impression, I'm rather taken with Castle's assorted ways to score and the bluffish but not uncontrollable action selection. There is a mite more strategy than is normally demanded from this type of game, with an early commitment required to place your workers on high-scoring positions.

However, it appears clear that it's a game that has only really been balanced properly with 4P, and as little as one or two 'psychic' plays could be enough to undo 90 minutes of gaming when playing with 3P. It's not a 2P game.

I was surprised by this - it is both lighter and quicker than I expected. The artwork is superb, and components top quality: it is beautiful.

The game features secret role selection, resource collection, resource expenditure, scoring for completed sets of resources. The rules are reasonably straightforward and simple enough to teach. It might not be my first choice to introduce a new player, but it would be a good "next" game to show a newbie.

I found minor problems distinguishing some colours (I'm colourblind) but with decent illumination this was solved.

There are many similarities with [thing=57925][/thing]: if you already have one, the other is probably redundant.

I really like this game! The board art is as beautiful as Stone Age and the game play is as easy as Thurn and Taxis! You are building a castle! And through your hand of action cards you may collect resources, build a part of the castle or buy a seat in the castle for end game scoring! A quick medium weight game, thats strategic and most enjoyable! The 2 sided board provides a summer and winter castle variation to the game that should enhance replay ability.

Simultaneous role selection to choose between getting resources / money or building stuff in the castle. If building stuff, you choose between VP's or more money, and you also get to pay to put dudes out into castle jobs, in effect setting them up for one of the many different end-game scoring options. Which you'll then work towards making as big as possible. There's a double-guess element as to when to play your Master Builder character - it gets your characters back but you aim to do it on a turn when lots of other buildings are being built to get bonus VPs. You're pretty much locked into your strategy by mid-game and then it's a matter of continuing through. Turns go quick. It didn't feel overly competitive, pretty much playing your own game but trying not to give points to other players while you do it, until ... your resources start getting stolen, someone beats you to where you want to go and your game is down the gurgler and you're looking around to see what's left to do and how to pick up the pieces as best you can with only a few moves left. On the upside, there's different scoring strategies to explore, with a map variant as well. On the downside, the game can easily cause pain and gritted teeth if you're the collateral damage.

Good game! After a reluctant first game I wasn't sure about it, but I did play it with inexperienced players, which seems to make a big difference. After playing it with the usual group at last, it really started to shine. Right timing for the role cards so that you can place the helpers in the best places is essential. A good game that will see many more plays before going back on the shelf on holidays.

Gorgeous board! Menzel at his best... on both sides. Love the golden summer and the melancholic winter!

This game is like Stone Age in that you collect resources with different fixed values and convert them into victory points.  The game art was very nice, and like Stone Age, the resource bits were shaped like what they represented.  However, the game itself seemed pretty bland, and strategically it seemed a bit shallow.  There was some simultaneous action selection luck, particularly with the Master Builder.  I tried the money strategy when I played, it seemed like it might be overpowered.

***

A CASTLE FOR ALL SEASONS looks stunning. But already owning PILLARS OF THE EARTH – do one really need another “worker placement-medieval-building” game with Stonemasons, Master Builders and artwork by Michael Menzel?  

Reading the rulebook, I spotted more apt connections to STONE AGE and RACE FOR THE GALAXY. That was a bad sign, as I think STONE is only half decent and RACE is less than that. But when eventually playing, CASTLE proved to have a character of it’s own. Compared to PILLARS it’s brisker and trades away some amount of long-term strategies for tactics. Timing is arguably more vital in CASTLE. But most important – it’s a different type of game.

Using resources in CASTLE is similar to STONE AGE, but in CASTLE currency is just as important. You need resources to build with craftsmen, but you also need money to place your “helpers” in end score-options. In STONE food wasn’t nearly as crucial, it was pretty a straightforward affair collecting resources for buildings/civ-card. Perhaps STONES multitude of end scoring paths is a sign for more possible strategies, I just know that CASTLE has actual interaction between players and a more interesting end score. Also, CASTLE has the right playtime/variation for this type of game whereas STONE feels “samey”.  

(STONE has dice-luck, CASTLE has some unpredictability when playing the Master Builder card – will others build this round so I can score for their buildings?)

CASTLE bears resemblances to RACE in the way role cards are played. But in CASTLE you are interacting, not just racing to complete your own puzzle. Some might dislike that players don’t sequentially “answer” each other’s actions: every action is determined by secretly selecting a card and play it simultaneously with the others. But it works better than in RACE; there is more to win from other players if you pay attention to their actions. And given the fact you can’t reuse your different types of card characters unless a Master Builder is played, you have a better hunch here what others might play. Given the fact that the options gets fewer with every card played, CASTLE has just as much resemblance with NOTRE DAME.

CASTLE is roughly on pair with PILLARS, but different. Theme aside, it shares some things with STONE AGE but CASTLE is quite the better game. And – luckily for me – it's no RACE FOR THE GALAXY.

I enjoyed this worker placement game.  It has some interaction.  The rules are easy to learn and I like how it has a limited number of rounds, so easier to get played.

Some of the later placements aren't equal for what you pay for, so I'm a little disappointed there.

For a worker placement, it's more vanilla vs other ones.  It's a fine game to play, however doesn't excite me like others.

This is definitely a game that I'd like better with more players (played with two only so far.) This is another worker placement/resource management game. With two players, the decisions never felt particularly tight -- there were always resources to be had and places to build when you wanted to (even when playing two cards apiece.) With four, I think the game would be a lot tighter and more fun.

Nice Worker Placement game. The rules also include a bit of "hidden role" selection, but it is limited, kind of reminiscent of "Mission:Red Planet".

My wife loves this game, it will see lots of play, I am sure.

I played this game again and for some miraculous reason, I did enjoy it after all. It plays quick and the action choice mechanism is interesting and quite balanced when it comes to the interaction between player and makes things like turnorder very important for your strategy. It takes  a while to grasph all the different possibilities (worker placement for VPs) but once you get it, it's cakewalk. I can see how some people might feel this game gives you too many options without doing anything to influence or steer your decision through events / phases etc, but there are always the winter cards to mix things up. Gorgeous artwork and a nice theme round this up. Good stuff !

One word: uninspired. Another word: generic. That pretty 
much sums up how I feel about this game.

ACFAS takes the citadels mechanic of secret role selection and combines it with a worker placement game that is reminiscent of Caylus.  The result is something less than competent. Where Mission Red Planet succeeded in taking the blind role selection into the area control genre, ACFAS largely fails in implementing it into a worker placement game. 

One thing that struck me as odd is that a lot of the strategies depend on the help of other players to score points, but most likely they are going to avoid that. So there ends up being 1 or 2 optimal places to put a worker and everything else is less than good. It also seems extremely restrictive to forbid overpaying, and turns all building decisions into tedious over calculation. 

Playing this game seems like a waste of time when there are so many great alternatives: I’d take Citadels and Mission Red Planet over this any day.

RATING: 7.8
In A Castle for All Seasons you are endeavoring to build a castle.  Each player has some workers, some role cards, and money and they each play a role in achieving victory.  Each turn players simultaneously choose a role from their cards which determines what they will be able to do that turn.  Each role may only be played once until the special Master Builder role is played in which all players get all their cards back.  The roles allow players to gain resources, money, or build structures in the castle.  Without resources players cannot build, without money players cannot gain the abilities of the structure they erected.  There is a careful balance of strategy one must employ.

Two of the builders allow players to place workers in the castle, for money, which will net them points at the end of the game.  One of the builders gains points for building, while the other gains money for building.  Three of the roles add resources and allow the players to build a building for half of the victory points.  The Master Builder allows people to get their roles back while also gaining 5 points for every structure built that turn.  Players cannot directly interact with each other, but in choosing which buildings to erect they may effect the worker bonus of another player.  No two games have been exactly the same, each one offering opportunities for different strategies.

RATING: 6
I think this is much better face to face for one very important reason; You can physically divide your resources into certain pile values. This really cuts down the arithmetic during the game and speeds up play significantly.

Reminds me of a cross between Kreta (for the card actions), and Pillars of the Earth (for the worker placement, resources and theme). I prefer this over Pillars because it does away with the luck problem with placement order from Pillars and final card purchases. This is simple, but gives you a decent choice of what to do each turn and plays fast. There's a bit of player interaction - observing when the Master Builder has been played by other players and reducing your building that turn, plus the usual worker placement grab, etc. A solid game with some variation. I quite like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It looks like a worker placement game, but it doesn't feel like it.  It is more a resource management one in which players pick their actions using a deck of cards, with some bluffing and looking for the best timing.  The workers are used to buy different bonuses to score at the end, but have very little impact in a normal turn gameplay.  A [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=208&Itemid=1]Castle for All Seasons[/url][/i] is frenetic; you are not even warm yet when it is about to end, and the last turns are a race to do something with whatever you have in the hand.

A játék hossza roppant érdekes. Ha ránéz az ember a táblára, meghallgatja a szabálymagyarázatot arra gondol, hogy jó hosszú sok tervezést igénylő játék mellé ült le és itt van a nagy tévedés. Fix körök vannak (2,4 játékos esetén 12, 3-nál 15) és elég hamar pörög a játék (kb 60 perc). Mindenki titkosan kiválaszt egy szerepet a kezében lévő kártyákból, majd felcsapják és egy előre meghatározott rendszer szerint végre is hajtják ezeket. Egy kicsit lehet gonoszkodni a másikkal, de annyira nem vészes a dolog. Minden összefüggésben van mindennel ezért nagyon figyelni kell a pillanatnyi állapotra a táblán. Vannak erős karakterek ha megfelelő időben vannak kijátszva. Nem csak szép, hanem tartalmas játék.

Hmmm, only 1 play and that was only a 2p game.  Not bad but it didn't quite grab me.  Great components and the board is beautiful.  Seemed like a nice blend of mechanics and very well balanced, but with 2 players you get 2 role selections each turn = more than twice the amount of thought.

Must watch what the other players are doing and stop any one player monopolising any given thing.  A fair amount of indirect interaction.

Am looking fwd to try with 3 or 4 though as I think I'll like it a lot more, but won't readily be going back with just 2.

I'm not sure why I don't like this. Perhaps I was just "Euroed-out" when I played it. It IS clever, and the simultaneous play of cards is neat (cf Hoity Toity amongst others) but the pasted on theme is pasted on VERY thinly. I won't give it a bad rating because it's probably quite a good game - and maybe I'll like it better if I ever try it again but that won't be soon.

Contrary to what its epic cover might suggest, A Castle for All Seasons is a tactical game which is playable under an hour. At the heart of this resources-to-VP affair is an action selection system similar to that used in [thing=18258][/thing] and [thing=124361][/thing]. Players play actions from a hand of cards, but may not reuse the same action unless the hand has been refreshed. The refresh action also allows you to leech off your opponents if they are constructing anything, so a bit of sneaky timing helps.

The rest of the game comprises standard Euro stuff tweaked with varying degrees of success. On the brighter side, I like the ability to choose which endgame scoring objectives will be available. But then you also have to deal with the finicky cost requirements for construction which simply aren't [i]fun[/i] to calculate at all. 

Gameplay aside, the rules are fairly complex for a short game, and Michael Menzel's art looks a little too busy this time round. Overall the game leaves a hollow feeling; the designers clearly tried incorporating several innovative design elements, but many of them are half-baked and don't jibe together well.

Looks can be deceiving: this is a role selection victory points race in worker placement clothes... Bought solely by looking at Michael Menzel's amazing artwork and the premise of being a castle building game. Turned out to be a role selection game (e.g. Citadels, Puerto Rico, Carson City) with a lot of interaction, and minimal worker placement. It is a very quick victory points race in a set amount of rounds; you will need to decide quickly on strategy/tactics in the first rounds. Prone to AP due to resource & VP path calculation. Excellent component quality. As I had other expectations of the game, the initial disappointment required a few plays to turn into "mixed feelings": quite the 'odd' game in my collection!

Kicsit Mission: Red Planet, kicsit Stone Age jól összegyúrva, gyönyörű megvalósítással kétoldalú táblán, két különböző játékmenettel. Rövid, könnyű szabályú, szerencsét mellőző játék. Igaz, hogy újdonságot nem igazán tartalmaz, de egy jól működő játékról van szó, ahol jól meg kell fontolni egy-egy szerep bevetését. Egyértelműen többfajta út vezethet a győzelemhez. A játékosok ugyanis egy kastélyt építenek, amelyhez minden körben szerepet választanak. Építenek, nyersanyagot gyűjtenek, esetleg pénzt szereznek. Csak kis konfrontáció van benne így pároknak is ajánlható. A pontszám még emelkedhet is.

[2011-09-26]
A pontszámon nem emelek. Marad nekem ez jó játéknak. Igazából meg kell érezni a másik vajon milyen szerepet választ. Akinek jó a megérzése az lesz ebben a játékban a jobb. Tetszik, de nem lesz nagy kedvenc belőle. Úgy gondolom egyértelműen 4-en lehet a legjobb.

RATING: 7.5
The name is a lie.  This is really only a Castle for Some Seasons, two to be specific, which is a real disappointment.  I feel like I got shortchanged a bit.  Now, I'm sure they will put out the Spring and Fall expansions, but then I'll have to fork over more money to complete the set.  

I'm pleased, though.  They really pack a lot of game into 45 minutes.  It has a tough little economy and every action is valuable.  It kicks the poop out of anything that Hoity Toity ever did.  

Yes, it's your typical Euro, you know, building a castle and all that, but it is a good one.  The system plays quickly and there is a fun group-think as players are secretly choosing interactive roles in order to squeeze out money, resources, and VPs where you can.  

In a world overstuffed with Michael Menzel worker placement games this can look a little misleading.  Yes, you place workers, but really for the most part you are just paying to reserve VP bonuses for the endgame.  So, this is mostly a game of efficiently playing your special power cards to get money and resources for building buildings which reveal costly VP hotspots.  

I'm not going to go so far to say that this game is original, but it certainly isn't the standard fair that I was expecting. 

I'd like to give this an 8, but the friction from making exact change with three different goods can be quite cumbersome. I am forgiving of it as I see its purpose and appreciate it there, but sadly it slows the game down significantly.

One of those games that always seems to be over too quick. Within this very fast play time, you will find yourself:  attempting to guess what your opponents plans are, managing your resources as best as you can, building parts of a well illustrated castle, placing workers, attempting to sneak extra victory points on some turns, interacting with others, and in all just having some really warm, awesome euro-fun. Castle for all Seasons just does it for me - in a way, it has much of the strategic and tactical depth of a longer affair packed into a quick, nimble little little game. Kudos to the designers. Some folks have found this game dry and luckless. I say the dryness does not parch, and the lucklessness is not a minus, but a big ol' plus sign.

It's not a bad game. It's just that the replayabily is lacking. After five games, my desire to play again is very low. It does have some great mechanics: the variablity in paying resources is a great feature. But the game as a whole is just too samey after multiple plays.

Definitely want to try this again, although I'm not sure I need to have it.

RATING: 7
This game successfully and smoothly melds many different gaming mechanics into one fun, very "thinky" game that I quite enjoyed.

The game starts as a simultaneous hidden role selection game much in the same vein as Race for the Galaxy but with those roles you take worker placement, resource gathering, and building actions.  The different roles and the different bonuses they convey seem well-balanced and thought out to provide a good range of different ways to play.

The most original mechanic in the game are the building requirements.  There are 5 resources that each have different values (1, 2, 4, 5, and wild).  In order to build you have to match the build value exactly AND use at least 3 different resources.  This makes balance important as you not only need high value resources in order to build the more expensive improvements but you also need the lower value ones to nickel and dime to the exact value.

There's no variety to this game, it's set up the same way every time, so it would probably get old after a certain number of plays.  However, there is a few different ways to play this game and a lot of analysis to tackle that should bring with it a decent amount of replayability.

Played with 3 players
I liked the game. I think of it as a normal resource management game but with some interesting decisions. The timing to guess what to play is something that I agree is not concensual but it's a good mechanic in my opinion. I don't like the building that allows players to trade for 5 resources. It seemed too much strong.

Feb. 14th 2009
Played again with 3 players. A bad experience due to some "out of the game issues" but the game revealed itself the same with a certain amount of curious decisions, specialy the timing of using the master builder and the constructers. There's not much in this game to be played more than a few times a year but it's not a bad game either. On its side is the fact that it does not take too long to play and turns play very fast.

I still have to play the winter version of the game but I'm not sure if it'll make the difference. I guess I won't be doing so for the rest of the year mainly because my gaming group doesn't like it at all - so it seems - but I'll try to play that winter version before making the decision of trading it away or not.

It's just the same old story.

researched purchase.  this and lancaster were my 1st two purchases not based on friends influences.  i had joined bgg and started searching and viewing games and getting used to the website, checking out all it had to offer (& i'm still learning things). i liked the simultaneous action selection aspect, i like castles.  i like that this also plays fairly quickly, not a 3 hr slog.  and i liked the game bits, sand, wood, brick stone and silver and funny looking meeples.  and i still enjoy the game.  i don't win often but the game has enough tension and the feeling of "if i had just 1 or 2 more rounds".  funny note though, after i bought this and showed it to our gaming friends, they said they had the game too still wrapped in shrinkwrap which they got as a freebie at Origins.  funny.

Ultimately, I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with this game, but I do know I dislike it greatly.  I could never figure out what was important to do toward winning.

A freebie from Buckeye Game Fest 2010. (It's GOOD to belong to CABS!) Unlike what usually happens with these games, instead of tossing it on a shelf at home I ripped it open and ended up playing it twice, 4-player and 2-player. Not a bad game at all once you get used to the iconography. It feels about as heavy as Stone Age. Collecting the resources seems almost like a separate game from the building and strategizing of which spaces to buy. I've noticed people I have played with tend to all play the roles in mostly the same order.

In mezzo a montagne dalle pareti scoscese si staglia la silhouette di un monumentale castello. Una fila di mercanti si snoda attraverso il portone; il brusio e le urla attirano parecchie persone speranzose di trovare lavoro e cibo. La piazza è piena di bancarelle e il magnifico castello cresce attorno a loro. I giocatori sono costruttori che, turno dopo turno, si avvalgono di lavoratori ed aiutanti nella maniera più conveniente per conquistare punti vittoria, partecipando alla costruzione del castello. Quello che sarà più abile meriterà la vittoria e la protezione del castello.

RATING: 8
Worker placement Euro that provides enough strategy and challenge to raise it above the plethora of games in its particular genre. The gameplay revolves around using character cards to acquire resources which in turn can be used to construct the buildings contained within the castle. The buildings themselves produce victory points but there are several other ways to score too, many of which are only revealed at the end of the game, which can result in some surprise victories as a supposed runaway winner can often be surpassed at this juncture. There are issues surrounding longevity - after you've played the game a few times you've seen pretty much all it have to offer, although this is alleviated somewhat by a double-sided board which introduces a winter variant and includes a number of 'negative' events that have to be dealt with thereby introducing another level of strategy. The artwork by Michael Menzel is excellent (as we have now come to expect from any game he has worked on) and deserves a special recognition.

As close to a perfect game as I've played so far. I just wish a) I was better at it, and b) that I could convince more people to play it with me!

I love the simultaneous role selection, the balance of having to gain resources and collect money, the trade offs between building for immediate VPs and building for money to score end-game VPs, I love the parasitic point scoring from other people's work and I love that you can set yourself up so that other people have to score you some points if they want to score themselves more.

An overworked repurposing of leftover Stone Age components.  Wholly lacks the simplicity of its predecessor.

Oh - and it reminds me more of Citadels . . . I hate Citadels.  Let's get all the game designers together and call a truce on game mechanics that allow the leaders to play keep away and pick the pockets of people trying to catch up.  Can we do that?  Great.

This is an interesting role-selection game with a castle-building theme.  For a fairly tight time frame of just over an hour, there is a lot going on, with plenty of interaction.  As with other role-selection games, players will have to predict what their opponents will choose in order for everything to come out just right.

I like this quite a bit. Castle for All Seasons combines role-selection with resource/building and worker placement in a cohesive package that's pretty tense throughout. I've played with some folks who complain about the cards that steal resources or give points players when others build, but it's not random. Guessing what other players will play and adjusting your role selection accordingly is one of the mechanics at the heart of this game. If you are unwilling or unable to to change up your play a bit, others will take advantage. I'm looking forward to trying this with the expansion winter cards.

Castle gives the impression of a strategic game in what is a choppy tactical experience.    Critical house rule: reduce the "three material" rule to a "two material" rule to remove the most annoying math.  Menzel's artwork is gorgeous and nearly worth a point.

First Impression:
A strange unintuitive euro.

There is definately strategy in this castle making game, it's just hard to find it. The art and overall production is great.

The game is extremelly convoluted for no reason. Simple things like gathering resources are a chore, and all the mechanisms appear arbitary and disconnected. Despite the excellent artwork the theme struggles to carry through the mechanics.

This game really gave me the impression that it is a mess, mechanics wise. I'd like to give it a second try, in case I missed some hidden elegance, but I'm not exactly having high hopes.

It is a crossover between Pillars of the Earth and Citadels. Components are excellent. The game although it has simple rules, it is heavy. You have to really think your actions. Maybe too much thinking (I am not particular fun of "building with at least 3 resources that their value is exactly what the building needs"). If you want something more advanced than Pillars of the Earth, then Castle for all Seasons is an excellent choice. Still I prefer Stone Age over Pillars and Castle.

About [thing=38386][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
In [thing=38386][/thing] players are building the castle for the king. It is like the whole game passes in that corner of [thing=18602][/thing]. During the game, players will use a hand of cards (everyone has the same) to do actions. Once a card is used, it stays in the table, until the Master Builder is used, then all the cards are returned to the hand. Is basically the father of the card play in [thing=124361][/thing].

By acquiring materials (wood, sand, bricks,  stone, silver) and money, players will be able to build parts of the castle (like the gate, the defense towers, houses, the well, the castle itself, etc) and position apprentices, in order to gain end game bonus points.

It all works very neatly, smoothly and ends in briskly 12 rounds (for 2p and 4p) or 15 rounds (3p).

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At the start of the round, everyone will choose one card to use, and the reveal of which one is it is simultaneous. Then, in turn order, each will activate.

There are Workers cards take allow you to gain materials and build for 1/2vp; the Trader allow to gain materials each time a Trader is used (but your own Trader can be taken out); the Messenger nets you money; the Stonemason can buy materials from Workers used in the same round by other players, can build (to gain points) and allows to allocate apprentices; the Master Builder makes you take all the cards back into your hand, and each building that is made during that round earns you 5 points (it is, truly, like gaining moral by just showing in the picture); and others.

To position an apprentice is necessary to pay money. Some spots for them start open on the board, and several others open after a building is made (as it now exists and can be used). Apprentices only give end of game bonus points, they don't help during the game.

The game ends after 12 or 15 rounds (so 12 or 15 cards will be played), and the person with the most points (from building for points, by the Master Builder and by apprentices) will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Several. Which card to use is the most important, but not only in itself, but also coupled with: [i]when[/i] to use it. A Stonemason is better if used when someone else reveals a Worker. A Master Builder is great when the others want and have loads of material to build - a good and timely use of it can net you 15 points, which almost the same as building the Castle!

Timming is also important when taking materials from the tower and when building stuff - not only because several of the constructions are unique, but also due to the spots it might open for apprentices.

Which material to take is important, because the rules require that, for each construction, three different materials must be used, and the value required to build it must be exact. With this even the lowly sand gets to shine, with its 1 value, that can make everything add up.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Not the quickest game to be explained, due to the several character cards, but once everything is in place, the game flow is a breeze, going in a steady pace and its 12 or 15 rounds almost seem too short;
- Nice level of interaction between players;
- Smart gameplay filled with choices;
- Gathering materials and building is easy - there is no stress mechanism in the game (no feeding, spoiling, barbarian attacks, etc). Even in the Winter side, which includes events, some that can be bad, there still isn't pressure above that of the game getting near its end;
- Language independant;
- Superb art, both in the cards and on the board, which is a truly a piece of art - and you get two sides;
- The production value is really high, from the bits to the board and cards;
- For some the Winter side is a must, in order to have more emotion; for others, the Summer is the proper way to go with this light euro - luckly the game comes with both options.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Not all that thematic (we courted the Princess with sandbags, for instance);
- The manual can take several seasons to be understood.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a construction site, only that the buildings are made of lego. It is so easy to build in [thing=38386][/thing], that the challenge isn't in doing it, is in doing it better than the others, as everyone will achieve near their goals. Do you want to build the Castle? Chances are that you will. If someone do it earlier, well, you will still be able to gain nearly as much (or even more, depending on the types of materials you have) by making two other parts.

While timming is key in the game, even playing one step behind, can make you go well enough if you are still able to make use of good actions and have enough (money or materials) to use spots opened by others or build/allocate because someone didn't use the opportunity earlier.

In spite of me saying [thing=38386][/thing] is chill, I have seen people claiming the contrary - that it is, in fact, stressful, due to its short nature of only 12 or 15 rounds/cards used. Yeah, but this would imply that most games with finite and given number of rounds to end, is also stressful. [thing=124361][/thing], for instance, with its card trigger is much more stressful to me, since its unkown nature of precisely when it will end, makes for more tension.

[thing=38386][/thing], even on its more fierce side - winter -, is still like a lazy summer afternoon: you sip a cold drink, walk by a construction site, look at how things are going, say "good job" a few times, make some obvious observations, and then gain 5 points for being there when the King looks by the window. Maybe it's not easy to be the King, but sure is to be the Build Master in [thing=38386][/thing].

RATING: 7
Inoffensive, entertaining game without a big WOW factor. Maybe even a bit unremarkable in this day and age (the post Agricola/Caylus/Cuba/Pillars age). Still, the game plays somewhat different from other resource/building games, in that you play a role each turn whose effectiveness depends on the roles that other players simultaneously select (Mission Red Planet style). Others aspects worth noticing are the game's short length and the beautiful gameboard. I just do not like it as much as, say, Cuba, because it is (even) more mathematically inclined.

One play, the Summer board, Spiel 08.  This is at heart a worker-placement game, with placement constrained by the set of role cards available to each player.  Mostly the WP mechanism leaves me cold, but here it didn't bother me, and it's the cardplay that makes the difference.  Also, very pretty, and nice to have the double-sided board.

RATING: 7
I had been under the impression that this was strictly a worker placement game, and I'm glad that I was disappointed in that respect.  There's certainly a worker placement element to the game, but I find it interesting that it's something that's in the control of the players during the game, since some placements aren't available until players build a particular building.  Player turn order can come into play at that time, but there's a neat timing element in how you play the roles to best help yourself during the course of the game.  My first impression is that the game is well balanced, since I made a bone-headed selection on my first turn, and still managed to take second place by one point against someone who knew the game.  In addition, it works better with more players, since the competition among all the spaces on the board is a little too open, and I have to say, I wasn't thrilled with the added chaos of the Winter variant of the game.  Still, I would gladly play this again.

role selection like Cuba with a couple of Stone Age* ideas: the resources have numerical values that will add up to buy point tiles (*like the huts) and the areas on the board become various ways to score endgame VP (*like the cards)...it plays lightning fast, so you have to make every action count and there's some synergy with giving each other points and try to guess what other players are going to do so you can play off of their action...cool game

RATING: 5
Completely unimpressed.  Another resource acquisition game with players competing to build structures and to buy special victory condition spots for points.  The interaction resulting from the simultaneous action selection cards can be interesting at times, but everything else is fairly commonplace with nothing unique to call its own.  The helper spaces within the castle seemed unbalanced for the most part, with the market extremely overpowered followed by the main gate and the stable.  Pretty much everything you do during the course of the game will end up giving someone else points.  I was particularly underwhelmed by the end, even to the point of hoping we got the rules wrong (which we did at least on one occasion).  Have no desire to try again.

This was a fun game. I love the command cards mechanics, although it's an ugly game. The board is ugly, and the few minis each army has are mediocure. I'm also not a fan of having my army split between a few large minis and a handful of cardboard discs. 

I don't see this game getting a board or components upgrade any time soon, so I'm hoping someone else takes this game's command card mechanics and throws them into a beautiful game someday. Hasbro, you suck.

(Update: Yes! I discovered Concordia & Century: Spice Road use comand cards)

Really cool Command Card system here which you can set up some pretty cool combos, and asymmetrical play for six of the iconic D&D giant species. I bought the Premium Edition and felt the painted figures were worth it, and the art on the board is also pretty good. Card quality and art could be improved, as with many of the D&D licensed board games put out through various companies. But the mechanisms here are solid, clever and fairly strategic, and it's well worth checking out if you like dudes on a map style games, this one with a unique flair influenced by other modern games rather than another RISK.

Love this game with 3 or more, I don't understand some of the reviews, one in particular that slaughtered the game. I did wonder if they were just playing a different game. If you play with 2 which is possible this is about a 6.5. You can play it but it is not as engaging. Otherwise a very enjoyable and thematic area control game with some great card play.

I think this game has a lot going for it.  It has nice miniatures (deluxe pre painted) with translucent plastics.  It has a very interesting game mechanics where you play a series of cards and the benefit of the card depends on the cards to the left or right of the cards.  All 6 factions are extremely asymmetrical and there seems to be a story unfolding as the game culminates to the end. The only few Cons of the game that I have is the fact that it can be kind of hard to determine which cards and giants belong to which faction but overtime,  I am sure this will fade with more familiarity.  I imagine that the regular version with solid colors  that are starkly different would be easier at a glance to distinguish the different factions but again, over time I am sure after a few more plays this will not be an issue.  Only the Giant Champions are miniatures and I sort of wish the other giants which are just disks/pogs were also miniatures but I realize this is probably not practical or feasible. I like the game a lot but I think I would  prefer Kemet, Cyclades, or Scythe over this if asked.  Still, this is a solid game and lots of thematic flavor.  I am glad to have this in my collection.

A sleek and interesting hybrid design that leans strongly towards the Ameritrash half of its personality. Feels like a mashup of Cthulhu Wars and Runewars, which is great. Really dig the main action hand mechanism and the strategic choices it imparts. 

Best part of the game is the asymmetry and the narrative events tied to each race. The injection of story into a dudes on a map game is pretty solid. Looking forward to playing this more for sure.

It is allright. Not very bad. Not very good. Quite clever asymetry and mechanics (which i really like) are going head to head with preety "dont know what to do" tempo of a game.

RATING: 6.7
The game has, of course, some interesting points, like the hand managment of cards relationated with the available actions, the particular goals of each monster race, etc.
However, the outcome of each combat always takes some time because it´s not so easy to calculate and often is the origin of doubts in gameplay. The game is also a little fiddy so, especially when playing with 6, there is great downturn.
Assymteric powers are normal in a game like this but when a player gets a power (a spell) that, out of the blue, overrides a nuclear rule, it can be somewhat frustrating.
On the other hand, there is somewhat more dependence on dice than it was supposed and the board is no more than an excuse to physical put the players in contact, since there is no much advantage in fighting for area control.
Also the game drags for several hours (some 3 or 4, with inexperienced players) and the theme doesn´t quite appeal to me, so i might well skip this one. For this kind of game i rather play Blood Rage.

This game is intentionally unbalanced for thematic reasons. While it makes sense within the fiction it makes for a poor game.  It also has a brilliant card mechanic where each action you take impacts the next but you don't cycle through the cards enough times and are incentivized enough w/ powerful card to refresh you cards rather than building up the bonuses till you play through a your cards and have to refresh simply because its your only card left.  Story events give each race a unique mechanic and story to unfold but these exasperate the imbalance in the game.  In short the mechanics are brilliant in theory but don't quite work adding up to a rather frustrating and lackluster game.

Yes, it is a bit eurolized and the mechanic of 'some cards give bonus for playing early and some for playing late' is a very interesting one.
But in the end this is basically a "I attack and roll dice to see if I win" game. It also drags on a bit too long, but not terribly so.
The more I play these the more I'm convinced that I've grown out of it. The 'excitement' of rolling a critical die is almost 100% irritation nowdays. Other things excite me in boardgames now like the "oh! oh! oh! I see an engine opportunity!" and "Hope he doesn't take that tile before me. . hope! hope!" and "Hmm, If I place here, he doesn't get to use his special building. muahah".

Initial rating: 5 (the interesting card-mechanic lifts it a bit, would very much like to see it in another game)

Very asymmetric "dudes-on-a-map" game with some Euro mechanics. Each player has a set of command cards that limit their actions in a good way (they can't just attack every turn) and provide bonuses according to the number of cards played before or after. This creates some interesting decisions but also a bit of a script, as you will usually want to play certain cards early and others later.

Victory points are gained by defeating enemy units and completing private or public events. Public events usually consist of moving to a given region and spending a rune of the indicated color. That brings a very significant randomness, both in where the events must be completed and in the runes you get.

With fewer than six players, you are strictly limited in the selection of races that can be played. In a three-player game, for example, you must play with fire, frost and hill giants. This is somewhat frustrating, but it's supposedly required for game balance. However, the game is still not properly balanced, which has been acknowledged by the designer.

The unplayed races have some units put on the map during setup, causing an odd situation in my three-player game. As it was less risky to attack those neutrals, there was no combat between players. The combat system is well done, but with spells, special abilites, bonuses, rerolls and changing of results, I feel it takes longer than it should and really slows down the pace. A more streamlined system would have worked better. We finished the game a bit under two hours, but it felt like more. It takes longer with each additional player, since the victory point pool that serves as a timer increases, and I can't imagine playing it with six.

The highlight of the production is, of course, the miniatures. Some are really large and look very imposing on the board, especially next to the giant slayers. The problem is that there are just two of these champions for each race (and it irks me that the two are different for only for one race). All other units are represented by cardboard tokens that don't mesh well with the miniatures and obviously don't look as good on the board. I honestly would have preferred regular-sized miniatures for every unit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The cardplay and the asymmetry are really well done and very fun. The game is all about grabbing the neutral areas, though, and combat (while perfectly serviceable) is very flukey when it comes to dislodging defenders. It's hard to reliably wipe out even a modest opposition force, so often the next in turn order will profit from a failed attack. Couple that with the fact that the points from random events will  be showered on players somewhat arbitrarily, you have a fun game with clever bits where the actual points are doled out in a very unsatisfying manner.

RATING: 3
For me, who has zero experience of the world of D&D, and beeing a eurogamer, was "lured" into this game by they saying it had euro-elements in it. Bashing other players, and get bashed back for points, quite randomly determined by the roll of up to seven custom dice is really not my kind of fun. The map is just there for being in each others way reaching "events" that get you points. There is no point it turtling an area, as that doesn't get you any points, you are just denying other players points by doing so. There is really no sense to playing defensively, just get points by rampaging through the lands, just hacking and slashing! if that is your cup of tea, I'm totally fine with that, just don't lure me in!

Dudes on the map game set in a D&D fantasy world. The card command mechanic is very interesting and reminiscence of how Concordia's cards are played. The twist here is in the sequence of cards played. Certain cards played earlier or later will give bonuses to the command. I like the simplified battle system too. The race asymmetry in strength and objectives are well balanced. 

I have a few issues with the game though. The leaders and regular giants are just tokens yet the champions are these huge "miniatures". At least have some consistencies in playing pieces, publishers!  Also at lower player counts, the NPCs felt a little weird like they're just waiting to be slaughtered. I didn't like this about most dudes on the map game and its the same here.

So close to being a great game. Unfortunately, the card play lends itself to players doing a bit of everything without being able to focus on a particular strategy. While the different races play differently and add variety, multiple games with the same race feel awfully samey.

These minis are indeed a smaller scale than the standard D&D minis. Premium - as they are painted Mini's (reprint is coming as they have been sold out)

Based on the story first presented in the Storm King’s Thunder adventure from Dungeons & Dragons, Assault of the Giants is a new board game designed by Andrew Parks for 3-6 players. Players will need to command armies of giants as they wage war throughout northwest Faerûn. Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.

Assult of the Giants is a decent game in the realm of the Chaos, Cthulhu Wars, and blood Rage. it's mainly about defeating enemies on the board and being in specific areas to complete Events. Simpler than most games of the genre, it may be different enough to find a few occasions to land on the table. Better played with 5+.

RATING: 8
An outstanding card-based play mechanic combined with high production values makes Assault of the Giants a wonderful experience. The asymmetric clans are well balanced and each player will take different paths to victory, ensuring a unique play each time. I love the spatial element that changes the ability of the card depending on where you play it in your tableau. The game scales well to many player counts too, filling the NPC regions with the unused clans in a defensive role, ensuring every game is filled with conflict and customdice chucking.

Don't let the D&D name or giant minis fool you, this is a deeply strategic game with plenty of game under the hood!

Pretty fun dudes on a map game. I really love the giant miniatures that come with this game. I don't normally fawn over miniatures, but these ones are huge! They aren't CMON quality, but they're on par with Fantasy Flight, if not a little better.

The game itself is pretty fun. I like that turns move along at a fast clip, and the order in which you play your cards is cool. It gives me kind of a similar feel to Concordia, though I liked the system far more here.

However, despite all these things, this game doesn't really stand out to me. With games like Blood Rage, Kemet, and most recently Cry Havoc on the market, it's difficult to put out a game in this genre that really feels fresh and different. Assault of the Giants, except for maybe each individual team's central quest, doesn't really do anything all that different. You move around, you roll dice in battle, you turn things in (or fight) for points, and, worst of all, this game falls into what I consider a very unfortunate trend in these so-called "asymmetrical" games, where while every team is different, they're all basically the same. One team might have stronger units, even if there are fewer of them, while another has strength in numbers. It's all been seen before, and while I do appreciate the D&D theme here, I just wasn't that invested in this game. It moves along at a pretty quick pace for this type of game, but honestly it just feels like a second rate Chaos in the Old World, in my opinion, and I'd much rather play that.

While it’s supposed to be a clash of armies, there isn’t enough combat to justify that idea. Also, it does not feel like armies. Played with 3 players, the game is not very exciting. Also, most of the pieces are disks, except the champion. A huge miss on the component side.

1 Play - I loved opening the box to see those big minis, but then...  then I ended up using mostly cardboard discs. The champions (minis) didn't even end up being at all crucial to anything I did. Um... okay? Disappointed on that front, but okay... the gameplay was not too bad. Though I think this game needed to go for about another 30-40mins to actually feel fully satisfying and having really had some battles, with regions passing ownership a few times. Area control is not ultimately a priority as there are no 'end game' or 'ongoing' victory points awarded for this, only for killing things and holding specific regions at the right time. This mission or objective style of scoring works for the game. The hand of cards is interesting, as you balance playing cards for optimal effect, with playing them with will optimal timing. The play I had was with only 3 players and the NPCs were kind of boring. I can imagine playing with more players would be a much more rewarding experience, with many more betrayals and negotiations. Some of the art design on the tokens and cards are not visually gripping and I would say the miniature sculpts are not the most brilliant I've seen either. Overall, as a big fan of the 'dudes on a map' game genre, I would happily play this again, though much rather play others.,

I'd been trying to get this one to the table for a while, and finally did, but found it somewhat disappointing.  It looks like a dudes-on-a-map / area-control game, built around a central hand management mechanic similar to Spice Road.  However, it features the clever idea that each card you play is more powerful the more cards you have played on previous turns, up until you need to take a refresh turn to pick them all up and start over.  This leads to ordering your actions being a tricky puzzle, where you want to delay your key actions until they're powerful enough to achieve what you want, but need to figure out how to use the intervening time usefully. Unfortunately, the actual scoring of points is highly random-number-dependent, as your two sources of points are eliminating enemy units in dice-based battles and completing events that require you to be in a specific board region and spend an appropriate rune resource, which are drawn randomly.  In our three-player game, we never drew a green rune, making it impossible to complete those quests. Trade mitigates this, as you can force other players to exchange cards, but it didn't help very much in our small player count game where the right cards were nowhere to be seen anywhere on the table. Overall it left me feeling unsatisfied, a heartbreaker with a really clever central mechanic, and then periphery that is close, but only adds up to okay instead of amazing.

The components didn't help, as they have high production values, but only middling design.  Each race has regular and elite giant tokens, but they're not marked as such—you can only tell which is which by looking at both and seeing which one is worth more.  The cloud and storm giants have very similar background colors, and the icon that supposedly distinguishes races is mostly covered up by the units' costs.  You have two plastic champion giants, which are basically a third tier of giant, only marginally better than your elites, but they garner much more attention than your leader, who is a larger disk and whose special power is important to your faction. It clearly shows that they added the champions to have minis to get attention, and then made design decisions based on component limitations (champions can't be wounded, since you can't flip them like disks, and you can only have one in a region, since you can't stack them like disks).

RATING: 5.5
I was very disappointed in my first play of this.  The theme is fun, the big minis look great, and my group loves dudes-on-a-map area control.  But this was a sloppy mess. Some of my issues:

1. The pacing in this game feels very off.  Slow, ponderous, constricting.  The action card system has enormous potential, but for a game about area control, the limited number of move/attack options was painful.  

2.  A lot of unnecessary gunk which interferes with a clear understanding of how to pursue a strategy.  Spells:  totally unnecessary fluff.  Elite vs. regular units:  unnecessary.  Champion and Leader:  confusing and unnecessary. Giant-slayers:  unnecessary.

3.  Combat system just a bit too complex for what is ultimately a dice-fest.  Either make it less random/slightly more complex (card driven?) or simplify further (to something Risk-like).  As is, we felt this was overly cumbersome for being very random.

4.  Quests are problematic.  Your race's personal quests are going to play out the same every time.  And it really is in your best interest to pursue them.  So that leads to a constrained strategic narrative (do "this" or else).  The random quests anyone can do ultimately favor the lucky - whoever happens to control that territory when the marker lands there.  

PERHAPS if some of the systems were slimmed down or eliminated and the game facilitated the bash-you-in-your-face gameplay that its advertising, this could be a hit.  As is, overly complex, fiddly, unsatisfying.

This is a hand management/mini-questing game of feuding giant clans.  Each player plays a different giant tribe with asymmetric abilities, goals, and strategies to play the game.  All this takes place on a map and most of the goals involve being somewhere on the map with a certain resource to spend.  The most interesting part of the game for me is the card play mechanic.  Each player starts with 9 command cards, 8 of which are very similar with other players and 1 is pretty unique to that giant clan.  Each card played gives you a main ability and then a supplemental bonus, usually based on each card played before it (and sometimes each card played after).  So there is a lot of strategy to be mined on when to play a card.  And like with many games with similar card play mechanics there is a card that gets all your cards back but here you get to act with NPC giant killer figures each time you take back your cards to harass or even kill your opponent's units for half points.  No turn ever needs to feel wasted.

I definitely feel like each giant tribe plays differently and has their own strengths, weaknesses, and best course of action to earn points.  This does have me wonder about game balance though, certain giant types seem easier or more poised to collect points faster than others.  And speed of gathering those points is even more important considering game end comes in the style of Race for the Galaxy, there is a point pool and end game is triggered by that pool emptying.

The game doesn't seem to last that long at all which can be good but two things bother me about it, setup is a bit of a bear.  No matter the player count you always use pieces from all 6 giant tribes so there is a bit of setup for each game, an incongruous amount of setup based on a reasonably briskly paced game.  On top of which, like I alluded to previously, some giants seem to have an easier time accelerating into points where others require more setup.  If the points eventually evened out this wouldn't be such a big deal except the way the game ends makes it a bit of a race and faster point gatherers have an advantage.  Also, there is a bit of luck involved which again, the game doesn't seem to last long enough to balance out luck of the draw with setup for the resources you need.

Quality is pretty good with the caveat that I have the pre-painted set.  Although, hell, talented painters might prefer the unpainted (and cheaper) set and put an even better coat of paint on them than WizKids did.  But the figures, of which there are two per player plus the giantslayers, still look good and the rest of materials, dice and cardboard tokens mostly, is pretty decent which is saying a lot for WizKids which typically I don't have many good things to say about their quality.  I do wish there were figures for the giant lords as well (or even instead) but still, what's here looks good.

I've played this once. It's doubtful if I will play it again. There is a good, asymmetric area control game in here. Somewhere. It's just buried under mounds of unnecessary fluff. Consider that almost everything about each of the 6 giant races is unique: leader abilities, stats, victory point scoring conditions. Then add in a deck of unique spell cards. Three NPC giant slayer characters all with unique abilities. I can see that the designers must have made these decisions in the name of theme, but they have sacrificed simplicity and transparency. I often find that clear and simple wins the day in terms of getting games back to the table. Assault of the Giants is nothing like that from the perspective of explaining all the different abilities and exceptions in the game. The ironic thing is that the theme evaporates under the weight of different rules exceptions - players in my game were focussing on what they needed to get done to score points, not how this related to the overall Giants D&D storyline.

The highlight of Assault of the Giants is easily the action card system, which rather brilliantly makes every option considerably more gigantic than it would have been otherwise. Even so, there are far too many problems and little mediocrities that prevent it from entering the ranks of the best dudes-on-a-map titles.

Okay, after another play my enthusiasm (below) is tempered a little. A few things after a second play:

The element of luck. At most you can ever roll seven dice during combat. So far in my games people tend to keep their army together as one big fighting force. So when going up against a champion who has nine defense, the luck of the dice plays a pretty big part. Maybe you roll ten or so hits, but on his counterattack he rolls a few shields and a bunch of hits, meaning your force can be destroyed while the defender takes no damage. All based on the roll of the dice.

If you take a few wounds or some of your guys get destroyed in a battle, you're open to having someone else come in and kill the remaining guys, getting easy points. I know this is a common issue in these types of games but it seems especially prevalant in this game.

Besides the dice, there can be a pretty big luck element with the resource cards. As the Fire Giants I needed a yellow rune to complete my first event (alternatively I could occupy a specific location on the map, but that location was occupied by a large enemy force early in the game). For the first several rounds I didn't draw any yellow runes nor did any other players. When some finally came up, they were used pretty quickly before I could try to trade for one. This means I never had access to one of my primary ways to score points and one of my strongest units. Other players happened to draw the right resources at the right time and could easily complete their events, giving them points and sometimes other benefits. It feels like there should be a "discard three resources to count as any other card" rule to help combat the luck of the cards.

Going along with this, there's a bit of a "pick on the loser" issue. I played a six player game and it seems like the intent is for the Hill Giants (the weakest faction) to just roam around and collect food, largely left alone because they're worth so few points. However, given the luck of the dice, it was usually a safer bet to pick off some Hill Giants for a few easy points instead of taking on the larger guys (and possibly having your own army wiped out) so the poor Hill Giants kept getting beat up throughout the game, and they were the only target of the Giantslayers. The Hill Giant player didn't have a great time because of this.

My first impression was that one of the great things about this game is the ability to play 5-6 players easily, but now I'm wondering if it would be better with just four players. In that case you just have the four strongest giants in the game, maybe making things a little more even.

There's still a lot to like but the luck factor and the "pick on the loser" aspect aren't ideal.

---------------------------------------------

First play impression: This is the best dudes-on-a-map game I've played in a long time. So much to love here.

[b]First a quick warning.[/b] One reviewer took issue with the way that your champion can just shrug off most damage during a combat. When teaching the game to my group I made sure to emphasize this, so players knew what to expect. Knowing this going in, it's not an issue because you either try to avoid other giants' champions or you wait to attack until you have a sufficient force.

On to the game: There are some similarities to Cry Havoc that have to be addressed. Both games are asymmetrical, the card play has a similar feel, and both games are a race for victory points. However, this game is infinitely better than Cry Havoc, which was underdeveloped and had a really ugly presentation (the board, the green/orange/red gems, etc).

The card play is much better in AotG. You always feel like you have good options and you can plan for the next few turns based on how the cards work together. In Cry Havoc the luck of the draw could largely decide the game and you had to try to maximize your few actions the best way possible. The card play here is similar to Concordia, so the rules overhead is pretty low since the cards spell out exactly what you can do on a turn.

I've only played AotG once, but the factions here feel a lot more balanced. In Cry Havoc only two of the four factions were able to achieve victory among experienced opponents.

Dice! Though I'm a huge fan of Blood Rage, I generally feel that a good dudes-on-a-map game needs to have dice. Some newer games in the genre, including Cry Havoc, have tried to use diceless combat but they generally lose out on a lot of excitement, surprise, and the speed which dice can provide. The dice work great in AotG. The attacker rolls dice, uses any modifiers, then the defender does the same, then you assess casualties. It works great and it keeps the game moving right along.

Speaking of moving along, this game just hums along and downtime doesn't seem to be much of an issue. We played with five new players and no single turn took more than a couple of minutes.

The player count. I'll have to see after more plays, but it seems like this game works better at the higher player counts. I'll usually only play Blood Rage with four players, and Nexus Ops maxes out at four, so it's nice to have a game of this nature that works well with 5-6 players.

More about the gameplay: it's nice to have a little more going on than just killing other guys the whole time, but not too much going on. Most of your points will likely come from killing other guys, but each clan of giants has additional ways to score points and there are different neutral events that let you score points. The events are similar to the missions in Blood Rage, where you want to occupy a certain area and hold it until your next turn. Your personal goals tend to require you to move around, maybe collect certain resources, and play a card that is specific to your clan.

The only negative I can think of is that there can be a decent amount of luck with the neutral events. Sometimes an event comes up right where a giant is located and he already has the right resources to claim the event. Other times you might be on an event location but you just don't draw the right resources and there are no good options to trade for them. Will have to see how true this holds for future plays.

Overall I'm just really impressed with this game. After the disappointment of Cry Havoc I'm glad to have a solid game of this type. Rating based on my initial impression, could go up or down with more plays.

Played at 6 players, and felt badly flawed. My instinct is that 4 might work better.

What I've heard about the command cards sounds good, and I like the sound of giant minis.

It felt like Small World meets Concordia, but it's much more Small World than Concordia. I'm not a fan of Small World, so this game isn't for me. The bottom right of the map felt much more open than the top left. I'm curious about that design choice. I might play again, but I would never own this game. It's not my thing.

1st impression: Interesting take on the modern style of dudes on a map - tight map, not too much happens when you lose combat, a selection of non-combat objectives, etc. Action selection deck is always fun, Resource cards that are random is a bit weird, but mitigated somewhat by having a (forced) trade action. Spells and variable player powers add interest. Dice-based combat manages to be both simple and fiddly. Feels quite random so it's probably more suited to having a lark with gamer friends than a rich strategic experience. Is lighter than the current 3.77 complexity score.

Ameritrash in it's purest form. Fun but fiddly area control game that highly rewards conflict. The theme is great and I like the idea of each race playing differently.  A lot of minor rules to keep track of. The miniatures are pretty solid and are the reason for the high price tag. The rest of the components (card quality in particular) are horrid. I don't like the way the dummy player plays in a game with less than 6 players. Still very fun and interactive. WizKids, step your game up on the card quality. Between this and Tyrants, I feel like I've been robbed after purchasing.

Innovative use of cards to create a progressive system of card ability power.  Got the deluxe painted version.  Good but not great paint job but still nicer than plain but if you want to paint your own, go with the standard version and save a few bucks.

Using BGG's rating system, I give this a low score because, FOR ME, this game is not good.  I suppose the mechanics of it are fine, and the miniatures are fine (although they are apparently fairly fragile as one was already broken in the game I was playing, and I think it was only its second play).  But this game is definitely not my style; too confrontational.  I suppose I could play again, but I will try real hard to avoid it!

Preliminary rating after one play. 

Quick-paced game, very tactical, not very long to get into and not very long to play. I love the action system along with the simplicity of the combat resolution.

On the minus side I felt the dices were really subpar as I find hard to see what's what. I dislike the combat result booking system and wonder why a second set of dices was not included instead. Also, the unique dice could have been made more interesting rather than a small variation of the standard dice. I might order new dices for this game, because the game otherwise is really good.

really liked this one, played first game last night.  felt a bit like cthulhu wars lite, but very mature game design, great decisions, very assymetrical, FAST game play.  want to play this again many time.  The only thing that was a miss for me was I feel the action cards should be more assymetrical, but still a worthy keeper for the collection.  I think I like this better than cry havoc

A nice asymmetric game, enjoyed playing it. Looking forward in playing with a couple of different races.

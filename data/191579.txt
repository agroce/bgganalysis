This is a great entry point for dicemasters, but really, just go buy 2 destiny starters

This is exactly how I wish they had released all of the Dice Masters sets, fully contained and ready to go, you can use whatever strategy (dice amount) you want without needing that collection element. Granted, it's cute to rip open packs and hope for those super rares, but more importantly I just want to PLAY, and this plays just as well as most of the previous sets, plus it's a great way to intro a newer or younger player without throwing booster boxes in their faces or telling them they don't have enough dice for a normal team in their Starter set. Got a TMNT playmat with this, and plan to use the four Turtles as my team core, and then accent them with some of the Batman characters.

Really disappointing Dice Masters set unfortunately. Didn't enjoy any of the cards really.

Dice Masters is a great game system and the TMNT set is the best entry point into the game for new players. I love this game and if Dice Masters sounds at all interesting to you, pick this set up!

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I'd rather play [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123607/puzzle-strike-third-edition]Puzzle Strike[/url]

Rather than go for the starter set and additional boosters, this edition of Dice Masters includes all the dice in a single box so that you can play the four turtles as you wish. Unfortunately, the box is missing enough of a difference in rules to make it worthy of play beyond two players.

PLUS: all in one
MINUS: rules are still aimed at two players despite having four similar Turtles

Really glad they put all of this series in one package instead of the usual collectible style of Dice Masters.  Makes it accessible and easy to jump into.

This is ranked lower than the other Dice Master sets for a few reasons.  I wish there were fewer blank cards.  I don't like the inconsistent art style.  As a stand alone this box should have had more dice fore each character, I wound up buying 2 sets.

This is my introduction into dice masters and enjoy the fact that you get a complete set. Good balance of characters available, though this did make me want to buy the other complete sets as well. Need to note however that my significant other refuses to play this with me and most people I played was kind of meh on the game. I for one think it is a very entertaining experience.

After a video review: The game seems interesting. It's similar to MTG, but this one is non-collectible and stand alone. Which could be a good thing for me.

It's also very similar to quarrior, but now you can attack your opponent.

The only weird thing is that people seems to be able to mix up heroes and villains in their same dice pool which is weird.

This is the first Dice Masters set that is completely self contained, what you get in this box is the entire collection so no gravity feed packs are necessary. The set itself is nicely thematic (although why there is two versions of Splinter is beyond me) but a little simple, however this makes it a really nice entry point to the game as everything you need to play AND customise your game is right here in the box.

I am a big TMNT fan. Never played Dice Masters, but i guess they can be mixed. I like the classic cartoonist splinter, april, rockstead, beebop in this one, but i guess the 2017 addition has better game balancing? I'd like the 2016/2017 versions to be mixed...

Not my favorite set, but still good. Convenient that everything comes in one box and you don't need to buy boosters, but a little annoying that the max dice is 3 for these instead of 4 like most cards in most other sets.

My third attempt at Dice Masters, and I actually came away feeling satisfied! Turns out all you need is enough content in one box, and the game actually works pretty well. I applaud WizKids for this model, as I really dislike having to hunt down certain cards and dice. There are still a couple aspects to the game I don't care for...mainly that attacking dice go away if they deal damage, and how it's difficult to buy the really expensive dice...but otherwise I really enjoy this game. I'm even considering picking up other Dice Masters stuff to add variety to this set.

A solid 8 in gameplay but it gets a hard 9 for being a complete set. Can't imagine this game is very fun without max dice.

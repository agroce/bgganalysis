I enjoyed this stripped down version of Keyflower more than I expected.  The most notable casualty is the system for moving resources around a village (hurrah!).  The tile abilities are also simpler and less varied.  The contest in ending a round early is for a slight edge in a random draw of meeples and maybe for a river tile.  Still there are essential elements of Keyflower like the mean auction system, and the need to prioritise between developing your tiles and getting new tiles, between costly actions now and keeping a reserve of meeples for next turn.  

In the art department, Key-world's bucolic countryside has been concreted over and replaced by handsome images of London landmarks.  Production quality is good.

In Key to the City – London, each player aims to develop their own London borough based around their home tile, using the large hexagonal location tiles. With the use of "Keypoles", each location tile gives victory points and may generate resources (skill tiles or connectors that connect two location tiles). Connectors and skill tiles can be used to upgrade location tiles for additional victory points and productivity.

Take all the fun out of Keyflower and remain with the boring VP salad: that's Key to the City. It's not entirely boring thanks to the Keyflower mechanics, which are great. But then I might as well play Keyflower. ;)

Played and bought at Essen 2016.

Oh how I like how this game looks like. And it plays very easy and simply. Bidding for tiles with meeples, generating resources and building your own part of London is just great. It is also on the light side so most people should be able to enjoy it. The rulebook could have been written a bit more intuitively and the resource symbols on hexagons as well could have been drawn in a simpler and color coded in a more friendly way. Also flipping tiles with connectors on them can be a bother. But those minor details aside this is a nice game that can appeal to many a player. Solid.

Key to the City is in some ways an improvement and a downgrade from Keyflower.

To begin with what I consider downgrades, as compared to Keyflower, I miss the green Keyples; I miss the Keyple-generating tiles; and I miss the hidden end-game scoring information. 

I don't miss the resource moving for upgrades; I don't miss the road-based tile-laying; and I don't miss the three types of resource tiles that are randomly drawn. However, Key to the City doesn't replace each of those aspects with an improved sub-system. 

The connection-based tableau sub-system of Key to the City is a wash or a downgrade.  The production itself make it annoying to flip a tile. One should not follow the directions for placing a connector onto the tile and, instead, leave space between tiles and place them parallel along the edges of the adjacent tiles. Also, the requirement of placing a Keyple directly onto the tile you want to upgrade seems to make it overly easy to flood your borough with upgrades. The diminished variation of tiles along with the simplified connection-based tableau sub-system don't really end up improving over Keyflower, in my opinion.

I may miss the knowledge gained from seeing what Keyples your opponents take, as that makes the auction a bit less interesting, but my ultimate opinion on that point depends on how competitive and serious the group is being. I also enjoy the soft-pass/sailing of Key to the City quite a bit. I prefer the deterministic resource-generation of Key to the City, as well.

Overall, the core mechanisms still result in a good game. The game seems to suffer the most at lower player counts, largely due to the lack of variation among the tiles. If you play 2-4, I'd say go Keyflower. If you play 4-6 almost exclusively, I'd say go Key to the City. The changes end up speeding up Key to the City quite a bit while still giving you the engaging experience of Key's auctions. It's a good game that deserves play.

Some improvements over Keyflower, but also some missteps.

The streamlining of the spatial aspect of the game was a good move, but the bridges are fiddly to use in practice. Also, the two different kinds of bridge scoring was a little confusing.

The removal of the meeple-making tiles was unfortunate. I thought the trade-offs for using them were pretty interesting, and introducing a 4th color to the game changed the dynamic in the auction.

I also dislike the random meeple draw from the bag. I think the interesting player decisions in the auction arise from player knowledge of meeple quantities.

This game totally fell flat for me. It is supposedly a streamlined version of the game Keyflower, but it just feels worse in almost every way. The tiles and abilities are boring, the lack of transportation in your player area makes that aspect of the game feel boring, the colored connections are fiddly for flipping tiles, and the random draw of new meeples each round ruins timing aspects of the game.  Maybe I'm not the target audience for this game, but I can't see why you would ever choose to play this over its far superior (and only slightly more complicated) big brother Keyflower. By the end of the game our whole group was just bored by the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can see why others would prefer it. Very much streamlines resources, upgrades, and removes transport entirely. But, I find the meat of the game greatly diminished, as it mostly ends up sort of becoming a weird route building thing that is a little too open ended for my tastes. But, this game will punish you less for making a wrong move, as it's all about small move towards points, rather than the bigger ones found in Keyflower. On the whole, I would consider this easier, but only from a rules perspective. From a strategy perspective, I honestly found this a bit harder, because it was so much less about the big combos and more about the small ones over time. I would never pick this over Keyflower, but I would be interested in trying both at 5/6 players, and I suspect at that player count this would be a better game, or at the very least, better at keeping the turns flowing. As a 2 player game, I don't think I'd recommend it though.

Keyflower with the awkward transport rules removed and more theme added in.  I'll happily play Keyflower with gamers, but would choose Key to the City for less gamery gamers.

A bit simpler version of Keyflower, if you're familiar with that one. This uses the same system of bidding on tiles with meeples, but the tile effects are simpler, and the logistical hurdles to put things where you need to put them is also simpler.

I also liked how the final tile flip generally isn't going to be responsible for a bajillion points being scored in this one like it is in Keyflower. I've never really liked how powerful those last tiles can be in Keyflower, so I actually preferred this game, overall.

A cleaner version of Keyflower, ported to the city of London.  Some of the fiddly  bits of Keyflower are gone (green pawns, movement of stuff, etc), and it all works well.  Longevity may be a problem but it's fun enough and I enjoyed it.  Some unfortunate production flaws on the tiles (yellow appears as green, grey and brown are very similar) mar an otherwise enjoyable game.  Still Keyflower for me I think - it's slightly more interesting, and the production is better.

Two games now, and not sure I need to see it much more.  Keyflower is a better game.

I wanted to like this even more than Keyflower. I like that you simply draw meeples from the bag, while the tools are now face up. I don't know what I think about the links yet. It somehow feels a little strange.
However, I really like that it really matters where you place your tiles. It's now more like a puzzle, at least in the two first eras.
What I really hoped for, was that the graphic design was clearer, but I actually feel that the tiles are even more chaotic than in the base game. It's hard to sort the tiles out in the set-up phase, and it's hard to distinguish the scoring tiles from the resource tiles, especially in other players' cities.
Of course, the main mechanics of Keyflower is there, so it's really a good game, but it could have been better, in my opinion.

I wasn't a big fan of Keyflower so it probably isn't a huge surprise that I'm not a big fan of this, eiher. This game is basically streamlined recycling of the mechanisms in Keyflower, most importantly the tiles auction and the building and exploitation of structures in (the various players' parts of) the city.

On one hand, Keyflower deperately needed to dump some of its excess baggage and it's good to see e.g. the transportation system gone. That is a step in the right direction. On the other, some of the streamlining seems to have gone awry. The tiles and their associated actions are very uniform if not outright boring. Expect precious little variation from game to game. Yet upgrading is still fiddly as hell, especially with all the connections probably going hither and thither.
If you already have Keyflower, you don't need Key to the City - London. If you don't, you probably don't need it either, but whether you would prefer one or the other most likely depends on whether you want a more accessible but fairly straightforward game or one that is more complex and challenging.

KEY TO THE CITY ist ein entschlacktes KEYFLOWER, sozusagen die vegane Version als Prequel. Dabei wurden einige Elemente wie die grünen Meeple weggelassen und der Schwierigkeitsgrad durch Verzicht von Ressourcenverengungen und Besorgungsengpässen ein wenig an Komplexität gesenkt. Wem KEYFLOWER gefällt, der wird auch KEY TO THE CITY mögen. Aber wer KEYFLOWER hat, wird KEY TO THE CITY nicht brauchen. Stellt sich die Frage, für wen das Game gemacht ist, da KEYFLOWER-Fans eher zu KEYFLOWER greifen werden. KEY TO THE CITY ist dafür visuell deutlich ansprechender: der filigrane Architektur-Style auf den Plättchen wirkt gepflegt und der Bau von London gestaltet sich als kleine Kulturreise mit Sehenswürdigkeiten als Aufsteller.

In Key to the City – London the emphasis has shifted from resource management to the spatial puzzle of the optimum use and immediate placement of tiles and connectors. I really like this refocusing, it isn’t as demanding and unforgiving as the logistical resource planning required in the original. The fact that the available end game scoring Routemaster tiles are available from the start gives the game more focus and the random keyples draw gives a welcome dash of unpredictability. I think that the game is unlikely to become as a big a hit as its illustrious forbearer, but this streamlined version will definitely appeal to many gamers, especially if London has a place in your heart.

I love the crazy amounts of simple decisions that all have big impact. There's so many ways to interact, bluff and mess with other players while still being a very puzzley euro. Not only choosing what to bid on and how much to bid, but also what colour to bid is such a devious choice with a deep impact on the gameplay. I love passing, bidding on a tile an opponent needs to drive up the price and using an opponent's action just to drive up the upgrade cost. I haven't played Keyflower, but I think I'd prefer this more streamlined approach as it moves the focus from the puzzle of building your city/village to the interaction with other players.

Need back to back plays with Keyflower, but I think I prefer this one, as it still has all the puzzle stuff inside, but without all the clunky stuff in between.

However it's like playing two different games, one where you bid and one where you play somewhat solitaire, using the buildings you and others have built. Even though there is a fair amount of interaction, it doesn't feel that way.

All in all a good game which I will rate again after playing this and Keyflower back to back.

Also the theme in this one. Era1, Era2, Era3, Era4 - do they actually mean ANYTHING? They're certainly not chronological!! Which I think is a massive shame as they could have been so easily. It is fun to take all the tiles and attempt to actually build a map of central London using them :)

It's also a bit fiddly when flipping stuff that is fully connected.

An easier-to-explain version of Keyflower, though the set-up is a bit more involved. The brown and grey icons can sometimes be hard to tell apart, but it is generally easy to tell if the tile is going to just give you points (has a white box) or gives you some sort of resource via activation (has a colored box).

I prefer Keyflower though due to these two differences:
Main point #1: At the end of a round in Key to City, players draw new meeples from the bag, not by taking them from the boat. As a result, you have very little information to help you with what color meeples to use for your important auctions. In Keyflower, the meeples are different publicly visible lots and are selected in the determined turn order. There are also no green meeples.
Minor point #2: In Key to City, the only tiles that have any orientation concerns are the ones with rivers; there are no paths that you must match up with. I liked that aspect, though I think most people don't care or find it less stressful to be not involved eh heh.

I can get this to the table more frequently because it removes all of the elements my play group hates (transportation of goods, and upgrade tied to a type of tile, and blocking). Incidentally, I love all of the removed elements. However, the game scratches the same itch and the new infrastructure development mechanic is fun and challenging. I love the way turn order works in this game and it feels much more streamlined and the timing of the decision to stop taking actions in a round is a challenge. I think it makes you pay more attention to your opponents so you don't get out bid on a tile you really need. Additionally, it just feels like you can get more done in this game compared to keyflower (this could be a positive or a negative but to me it feels more forgiving). Upgrading is more fiddly than the previous game, get dragon tears to mark the tiles, makes it so much easier.

Mailed in reskin of Keyflower. Shameful matrix of differences between it and Keyflower printed in manual (at least they aren't trying to cover it up). This is more of an expansion or variant for Keyflower rethemed and reskinned with London city building but can't justify asking price.

Components range from very good (artwork and 3D Uber upgrade buildings, and, hey, shit pipes (sewage)) to weak - generic meeples, road and boat pieces lifted from Catan.

Definitely for Key fans only, and there's nothing wrong with that. But from a non-Key Fan's perspective, there's nothing new here so if you didn't like the others, then pass on this.

Essen 2016. We were invited to play this game at the Messe. We never played Keyflower, and were very happy with the mechanism how to use the Keyples in the game. 
The aspects that distinguishes this game to Keyflower make it actually worse. The wooden beams make it very difficult to turn the tiles upside down. The artwork is only temporarily modern.
In the end: good play, and it convinced me to buy Keyflower. But this game, sold as a lighter version of Keyflower, is actually just a worse version of its parent.

I like [thing=122515]Keyflower[/thing] but not enough to own it. I didn't enjoy the way the Winter tiles work. Key to the City address my concern by having the end game scoring tiles on display from the start. This is a big improvement in my opinion. 

The auction in the game is sublime, just as it is in Keyflower. The ebb and flow of meeples and the attention you need to give to which meeple colour you bid or activate with is challenging and fun. 

The game is significantly simpler than Keyflower in it's other systems. Resource collection and costs are straight forward. This shines even more light on the auction as the centre piece of the game. You will need to puzzle out some stuff in your tableau, but nothing too taxing. The winner will be the person who more astutely valued the various tiles up for auction each round.

I enjoyed my play but would like to try it again with 3 or 4 instead of 6 players. I think the game would be even better at those player counts. The 6 player experience was a bit too slow with too many other people to analyze*. 

If you own and love Keyflower then I would definitely play this before buying. If you disliked the auction in Keyflower then you will likely not find anything here of interest. 

I rate the 6 player game 6, but I think the 3-4 player game would be at least a 7 for me. Especially since all end game tiles are used in a 6 player game, but only a subset in the 3-4 player game.

*Due to being Canadian both analyse and analyze look wrong to me. Where u is concerned Canadian spelling looks correct, but zed just makes words look cool :cool:

I don't get to play the same game over and over again, so it is easier to get newer players to play this one rather than Keyflower, as the acquiring of resources is easier, and the placement of "pipes/conduits" is more forgiving than the roads of Keyflower.

Not to say it isn't harder, a new player may not be optimal, but they are not prevented from doing anything as they would be in keyflower.

Quite a good game. It's a bit abstract and the connectors are both fiddly and don't seem to make much sense thematically. 
Although you are poaching abilities from the other players and bidding for the tiles, it's still a bit multiplayer solitaire.
I haven't played Keyflower, so I can't compare with that game. I'd happily play again, but I don't feel the need to buy it.

After one play, I like it, but can’t really compare to the original Keyflower, as I have never tried that one. 

As with all engine-building games there are nuances that I won’t pick up on until I have some more plays under my belt, but so far it seems tohit close to my sweet spot in crunchyness. 

The i itial appeal, though, was the graphics and London-theme

I suck at this game system. Don't have the time or desire to get good at it.

Keyflower with a London theme.  Heavy game with some interesting choices.  But still a bit to euro / themeless for me.  In the five player game I found that the randomness of the title draw can leave some players wide open for the win - I don't mind the lack of an effective way to crimp a leader so long as it is a level playing field to begin with.  

Components are bad for red green colourblindness with brown and red too close in shade.  No desire to own, and many other games I'd play before this one.  Preferred base keyflower with 3 to this version with 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I would likely rate this a five, but for the fact that I've played Keyflower multiple times and cannot help to make comparisons. 

This is very much a dumbed down game. Many of Keyflower's best aspects are gone. There is zero variety in the tiles. Produce connectors, produce skill tiles, or get some points. Who cares?

Speaking of connectors, who the hell thought these were a good idea?  They are a tremendous pain in the ass, making the constant upgrading a far more painful process than it should be. 

Speaking of which, by Era 3, most of what you're doing is upgrading tiles, which is a total snooze. Gone is the logistic exercise of moving goods to tiles. Just place a keyple on the tile to be upgraded and have at it, as long as the prerequisites are met, which is stunningly easy. 

All in all, this game was a complete miss for me. Perhaps if hadn't been aware of the joy that is Keyflower, I might have liked it better. As it is, no thanks.

This is essentially a separate spin-off game from Keyflower, as it holds a lot of the same mechanisms of building up your own area from tiles you bit on with "keyples" (essentially meeples, the name's just a gimmick, really), using and upgrading said tiles to improve actions and scoring conditions.

The way this game is different is how you are not only building up locations in your own borough of London, but you are adding infrastructure (water, sewage, gas, electricity, telecom and underground) between the locations as well. Also there are 3D monuments that can be constructed for additional bonus points.

Other differences are that you are no longer transporting goods between locations, and upgrading a location is done by activating the tile in question. You also determine the new starting player by which spot a player decides to take on the river when they decide to "set sail". If you choose the leftmost spot you are also given the previous era's river tile to place in your borough.

I really enjoyed this game, I completely agree with the claim that this is a more streamlined experience than Keyflower. It doesn't hurt that London happens to be my favourite city in the world, so the setting of this particular game is even more appealing to me. Definitely a keeper (or should I say keyper?)

Not sure about this one yet. Will see what any expansion/follow up will do. 

So far it's too simple and everything blends together too much. The buildings are all the same and score equally, just for the different colors.

If they add a lot of more unique scoring buildings and powers it might work and replace Keyflower. So far it's definitely not.

No longer interested. Watched Rahdo play a few turns (he liked it and compared to Keyflower(?)) but found it really boring. What's more, the bidding and action mechanism seemed weird, as you can get lots of free actions if the other players have passed. The connection puzzle is not attractive for me, at all.

Interesting streamlining of Keyflower. I love the setting and the graphic design. Connections are an intriguing replacement for resource transportation. How does it stack up against Keyflower?

Not well. Most of the streamlining (random bag draws, no winter tiles, no green keyples, no keyple draw, no roads) reduces the tension in the game. Without the winter tiles, there is no long term strategy, and in fact I don't see as much variety in goals. Sailing sounds like a tense decision but in fact not being able to react to the player who is still going actually reduces tension. Flipping tiles beneath 6 connectors is actually even more fiddly than resource cylinders.

I really wanted to like this, and it probably is a decent game, but it's no Keyflower (a Top Eleven game for me).

Key to the City: London is a lighter version of Keyflower, which suits me just fine. The special tiles here fall into broad categories here, and have far fewer rules exceptions than in Keyflower and the "connections" puzzle is at least as satisfying as the pick up and deliver puzzle in the original. I definitely prefer this to the base Keyflower.

A streamlined version of Keyflower. No matter what they say, the experience is very similar. Keyflower has been deprived of the logistic features and the tiles are more similar. It's easier to see how to get points from the beginning and a much easier experience for the players new to the game, but it's still far from being a familiar game.

Gioco molto bello e che permette la non semplice possibilità di avere al tavolo 6 giocatori insieme. Il gioco è una rivisitazione di Keyflower in veste più moderna e con alcune significative modifiche. Le nuove dinamiche hanno permesso di smussare alcune imperfezioni del suo predecessore e hanno lasciato più armonia al giocoriducento le limitazioni, come ad esempio il piazzamento delle tessere, di contro il gioco è diventato un po' più semplice e meno cattivo, anche se nel frattempo sono diminuiti gli effetti casuali quali ad esempio la pesca degli esagoni del quarto periodo.
Un gioco sempre bello dalla profondità buona alternativo al fratellone. La mia opinione è che se si possiede già Keyflower se ne può fare a meno, se non si possiede Keyflower questa è una valida alternativa e forse addirittura da preferire al primo.

Sadly suffered from a fatal flaw: that of making me wish - from start to finish - that I was playing Keyflower.

Worth a look for a smart turn order mechanic and is probably a lot more fun if you know London geography inside out and can storytell things in the same style as Suburbia. Otherwise, get Keyflower.

RATING: 7
I've never played Keyflower but knew of its importance and how many people loved it; it is the one of the first games to feature the "worker placement" mechanic. Key to the City has some small differences but the core design of tile-laying remains: bidding, building, upgrading. The effect of the game can be stupefying: there's much to decide. Okay, fine, you've decided to bid on a tile you want, but with what color "keeples," and how many? Enough to scare away your opponents or save them for next round? Maybe you should just activate the tile to get the benefit but then you're just giving away your "keeples," the currency for the game to your opponents. I can understand the frustration one feels when playing this sandbox-y Euro riddled with AP-inducing decisions. After all, you start with nothing and must build your engine from scratch. The phrase "multi-player solitaire" has some merit as player interaction is limited and indirect, which is fine as it makes for a quiet experience of everyone staring intently, silently at the table for minutes at a time (the partner of one of the players marveled, "Wow, you guys are so quiet! Are you guys doing anything?"). Key to the City is a classic Euro with all the great hallmarks of the genre: bland art that looks like it was swiped from 1994 Windows Clipart, a non-integrated and unnecessary theme, and never having to look or talk to anyone for two hours. But, seriously, the game is unique in design and execution. Credit must be given to the designer for bringing the "meeples as money" mechanic to a worker placement game. If I sound sympathetic to critics of the game, it's only because we played a short party game afterwards and we definitely had more fun in those twenty minutes than we did in the two hours we played Key to the city. But you get what I'm saying: these are two different animals. One is analytic and AP-inducing; a quiet puzzle to solve on your own. The other isn't. It's a fine game, just be sure to pair it with a game that relieves all that tension.

I so wanted to like Key to the City: London, but it sadly pales in comparison to its bigger brother Keyflower (which is within my top 10). As much as I appreciate the effort to streamline various elements of its predecessor, I feel it was a detriment to its enjoyment. The replacement of resources for connectors, and the overall theme is not well integrated with its gameplay, making it a merely bland "stick pusher." Although the artwork is unique and very attractive, I feel all the charm has been stripped away. "KeyLondon" is sadly one of my biggest disappointments of the year so far.

RATING: 6
In this semi-sequel to keyflower, players are using that same bidding system to acquire, activate and upgrade tiles, but despite the core mechanism being the same, this game has more of a unique feel than you'd expect. Unlike in keyflower, where your sub mechanisms mostly revolve around resource management and engine building, this game focuses on city building. The game comes with six different colored road pieces. The different hexes have upgrade and scoring requirements that looks for specific quantities of specific colored roads touching them, or leading to them following a path. This creates a very uncertain puzzle that I find quite interesting. With Keyflower, I like having a lot of players because you see more tiles, but in KTTC London, I feel fewer might be better, just to keep things flowing quickly. There is a lot less variation to the tiles, so less is probably more in this case. It is possible that the big scoring tile you've been lining up for gets bid out from under you. It's also very easy to become meeple poor, as there is no way to get new meeples outside of the meeple income between rounds.

The game has come component issues in that two of the wooden pieces are far too close to each other in color, which can cause problems for players in terms of knowing which tiles line up to which colors. 

I was hoping this could co-exist with keyflower, but there just isn't enough depth here to sustain it in my collection.

My issue with Keyflower is that, to me, its play feels scripted, which is emphasized by the kinds of tiles available during each phase. However, in Keyflower, there are so many moving parts that the puzzles offered during each game will usually be interesting. So even though it might be strategically lacking, it's tactically rich.

Key to the City - London is simply not that tactically interesting to me.

I do prefer the art of KtoC-L, but not the look of the game during play. It's not visually satisfying that the roads between tiles won't match up.

In comparison to Keyflower, I would rate this game a 6. If I was being totally unbiased and Keyflower never existed, I would say it deserves an 8. The auction and upgrade mechanics work well here, and there is a natural progression from round to round that mostly keeps players from stepping on each others toes, but something is lost in the simplification of one of my all time favorite games.

I would be happy to use London as a gateway into Keyflower or other auction games, but I'm afraid it will always be compared to the king.

(final version) I'm almost willing to up this rating by a point because the final graphics are gorgeous, even if the huge tiles mean you need a lot of space!  Scoring is still a little fiddly, but it flows nicely and feels about the right length.  
(playtest comment) Seeing this one evolve from Keyflower has been fun, especially as the one part of KF I detested (and complained frequently and vocally about!) - transporting resources around - has essentially gone in favour of a system that can be just as tense but in a different way.

RATING: 5
I was hoping that Key to the City - London would be a faster playing, more streamlined, better scaling Keyflower, and in that regard I was a bit disappointed. Key to the City should be faster playing and may work better at higher player counts, but doesn't work as well at lower player counts. With 2 in particular, there are way too many tiles per player, which drastically reduces your ability to contest tiles and the value in using tiles in your opponent's borough. In addition, there is much less variability, since the 12 connector and skill token generators are always in the game. Scarcity is a huge part of the variability in Keyflower, and it's notably lacking in Key to the City. Games with very little movement feel very different than games where there was a dearth of resources. I like that the game removed the green workers, and I think removing the tiles that generate more workers was necessary to speed up the game. I also liked the way the era 4 tiles start out face up so that you could plan for them and that the rules were more cohesive. However, the abundance of tiles leads to a less interaction and tension with 2, and the lack of variability really hold this title back.

tl;dr: the same, but more streamlined

I really like [thing=122515][/thing]. This updated version moves the setting to London and streamlines the game play a surprising amount removing stuff like good transportation, green meeples and other bits and bobs. The result? A game that is very similar but different.
One thing that I liked is how the river plays a role in this game that is quite different from the river tiles in the original. It adds a whole new strategy to explore (which I did, almost to great effect).
I was happy to find out that the streamlining didn't take away a lot of the fun that comes from both the bidding and the puzzle to optimize your tiles.
One play is not enough to say if I like this as much, more or less, but I did indeed like it quite a bit.

Certainly much lighter than Keyflower, not sure it adds enough.

I have not played keyflower before but I was familiar with the system going in. This is a clean version of the mechanics of keyflower but at the cost of the variety in the original, however that's no bad thing. I found this easy to teach and quick flowing for a game with good meaty choices. The theme goes over well with my group (UK based) and the production quality is too notch. I would recommend this for anyone interested in the keyflower series of games

This is a very good game, but Keyflower remains my favourite. It is simpler than Keyflower, but it is missing the green meeples and the generation of meeples from tiles. It is an improvement that it does not have the "moving goods" around your tiles.

If you want the tension and difficult decisions removed from Keyflower and have it replaced with fiddliness and blandness then this is the game for you.

Fantastic and entertaining game.  Perfect game to introduce new players to the Keyflower system.  Keyflower is the better game of the  two,  but it also adds more complexity, harshness, and can be unforgiving of mistakes.

Key to the city is more streamlined and plays quicker.  It is a great game that I am willing to get to the table anytime.  Nice mini introduction on the geography of London.

I never played Keyflower, but heard really good things about it, so I was looking forward to my play of Key To The City. The early and mid game were interesting - offering nice choices within an easy to follow rule set, and it is nice to create your own little city with tiles that score points in different ways. But the end game made it really swingy! If you misjudge the number of meeples that a fellow player has behind his screen only once, it can easily cost you the entire game - no matter your position up to that point! Very unsatisfying.

Ok, puzzle-like, worker placement/bidding game. Too short to really get going and mostly solitaire.

A lighter version of keyflower with more of a puzzle element and less of a brain burning resource management/heavy planning element. Overall, pretty enjoyable. Component-wise, love the 3D upgrade buildings (hate the weird color tones on the tiles though). Not sure there is much replayability here but I would play it again.

Rethemed/revised Keyflower.  IMHO, no better and no worse.  I did have my copy signed by Richard though.

A huge step back. This game is basically Keyflower minus most of the things that made it so interesting. The designers oversimplified too many aspects of the core gameplay and introduced a new concept of connectors that is just fiddly and boring. I don't see the reason for this game to exist. Do yourself a favor and get Keyflower instead.

Only played a "learning" game so far (none of the 3 of us had ever played before).  I enjoyed it a lot.  There are a lot of things going on; a lot of mistakes and missteps.  Love the ability to use other players tiles, not knowing what keyples people have left behind their screens.  Loved the auctions.  I am looking forward to playing this again now that I know better what to do.

Have now played again and it was just as enjoyable.  As a group we had less using of other's tiles.  Auctions were more combative.  Knew better what I was doing this time, and tried to be as helpful to the others as possible but still came out on top, so 2 wins in 2 plays.  :)

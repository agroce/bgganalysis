It's fiddly with little chits and many sequences so to speak to execute but very well implemented and seems to capture the Era and detail very well. 

I wasn't sure what I was getting into and felt overwhelmed at first but the forum provided lots of quick assistance and glad the time was spent learning it as it is very replayable.

Update: Yes, still a great game.

A simulation of WW1 air combat using a system derived from Downtown.  Suffers (as does Downtown) from an abundance of modifiers and chromey bits.  Unfortunately the rules are not as well organized here as they are in Downtown or The Burning Blue -- they have more examples and the use of colour is well done, but they're a bit chatty and difficult to find things in.  I'm also not convinced that this system is the best choice for WW1: why do my offensive patrols know where flights are when they are out of range?  The command and control here seems to be at least as good as it was in WW2: maybe the slower speeds require less coordination, but it seems a little odd.

This is probably a great game that will appeal to many gamers.  Great subject matter.

I have one problem with it.  I ordered it because it was promoted as a medium complexity game. It turns out to be a high complexity game.  I hate it when a game turns out to be significantly more complicated than promoted.  I have been burned too many times when this occurs.  If I knew it was going to be this complicated, I would not have purchased it.

Will trade or sell as soon as I can.

Hmmmm... interesting scale, concept, theme... I was hoping to like it but hey, after investing quite a bit of efforts, it doesn't work for me.

Log sheets. A ton of useless counters (why providing *3* full sheets of individual plane counters when the basic maneuver unit is flights???? No functional data on the counters, everything on the log sheets or ADCs????). Badly written rules, poorly laid out play aids and tables. Ambiguities. Dirty mechanisms.

Really, I wonder. Some folks seem to like it, seem to be able to play it. How???? I am not afraid of complexity, but this is silly, sorry.

I was really looking forward to this one, but I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a game. Had there been an editor or a developer on the project, the confusing descriptions, syntax errors, and logical miscues would have been caught and avoided. (If someone was paid for that work, do the right thing and return the money!) I believe the high ratings are the result of the very desirable concept, good-looking components, and some wishful thinking.

A counter is provided for (seemingly) every single aircraft and crew that participated on the RFC/RNAS side. As individual aircraft counters are seldom used, they're not all necessary. That wouldn't matter, except there are NO individual aircraft counters for Halberstadt DIIs, and way too few informational markers. It's one thing to implement a "cool" idea, another to miss vital components because of it.

We're told a line or offensive patrol must cover it's route by flying "back and forth, twice." That means a total of 4 legs - but it doesn't. You get 2vp for a leg, 5vp for a complete patrol. Do the math - you do an outbound leg and a return leg, and that's it.

In an era with no radios, how can it help or hurt a flight already behind enemy lines if ground observers in the trenches have or have not detected an enemy flight? Osmosis?

"Visual detection," "visual sighting," "tally," - all mean the same thing. Editing would have applied one consistent, understandable term.

A close escort flight, even though stacked with its charge and at the same altitude, can NOT come to the defense of the escorted flight under the standard combat rules - combat is resolved, all tallys are lost, and the involved units become immediately undetected. Meanwhile, the close escorts have their fingers firmly jammed up their noses?

After combat, involved units are subject to a "scatter" procedure. When they scatter, they're marked with a "manoeuver" marker. Gee, why not call it a "scatter" marker and save some confusion?

If you're not allowed to attempt to engage an enemy if you were climbing during the turn (rule 13.21), why make an exception if there's a cloud deck directly above your intended target (rule 13.22)?

Sadly, I could go on, but that's enough. There is a good game design in here trying to get out. GMT owed it to us to find it before putting it on the market. I'll think twice before I buy another game from them.

Make no mistake, BA is all grognard all the way and then some. Opening the box and looking at all the charts and rules can be intimidating unto itself. This is a heavy and complex simulation that requires serious commitment. However, once you get on top of the rules, the game flows very well. The quality of the components are superior and enhance the WWI theme. The map is one of the most aesthetically pleasing(read drop dead gorgeous)ever made. This is a surprisingly good game but needs two players to reach potential, and not the best choice for solo. There is a book called "Bloody April: Slaughter in the Skies Over Arras, 1917" By Peter Hart that is a very good reading primer before stepping into the game. For the uber hardcore wargamer this is it. I really enjoyed exploring this game.

Beautiful game that is very satisfying to play, but takes a long time.  It is very meticulous to play, but that attention to detail, the variety of mission profiles, the challenge of succesfully completing missions, and the rich story that a scenario creates is what I find to be so relaxing and satisfying about it.  Once the scenario gets going, a single turn creates an incredibly compelling story.  

Great value, well researched, fun.  Inspired me to buy and read the book that the game is based upon.   The book really helps to understand why the game is designed the way it is and what the game is simulating.  My one frustration is that the very nice looking plane counters are rarely on the board.  The vast majority of the game is played with generic counters.  This game is more of a simulation that oozes personality and story as there aren't a lot of decisions to make. It seems more like flights are desperately trying to accomplish their assigned tasks and gain tally on anyone they can see. It takes a long time to plan, set up, and get flights in position to fight, but when they do it is an intense riot of a good time and makes all the work seem worthwhile.

One suggestion for improvement would be to adopt the raid generation mechanics of Burning Blue to RFC tasking and German non-DCA tasking to make scenarios more re-playable.

A well produced and beautiful game, great for fans of the period since it is rich in flavor text and imagery. However turning a hex and counter game into the air requires a ton of chits and chart management, not my cup of tea, added to that the individual tokens are only used for dog fights and not on the board is a visual bummer. Streamlined for a wargame, this is a true simulation, and in that it works well, for a crossover euro-wargamer its not so fun. I think a 5-8 hour campaign would be fun but I cant devote that much time to this game.

Good grief. Another designer falls victim to the desire to add completely inappropriate and excessive levels of tactical chrome in an operational level game.

How do you end up making a WWI operational combat game [i]more[/i] complicated than a Vietnam era operational air combat game? In [i]Downtown[/i] some level of complexity is understandable given the level of technology - jets, missiles, radar, electronic warfare, etc. In WWI there's none of that, just biplanes. Ridiculous.

    I have been looking for this game since 1986 when I first played Dawn Patrol.  The scale is perfect for me.  The game faithfully recreates the big picture of the day to day air war over Arras and what the RFC was trying to accomplish in April 1917.  The lowly British two seaters such as the B.E. 2, F.E. 2d, and Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutters are finally given their place in the limelight with their all important photo recon, artillery cooperation, and to a lesser degree bombing missions.  For the first time in a WW1 aviation game two seaters are no longer just an afterthought to the more glamorous single seater dogfights but are the centerpiece of the game as it should be.  The tactics of the time are also faithfully demonstrated without turning a two minute dogfight into a 2 hour affair.  I just wish the Fog of war was a little better although thats almost impossible to do in any wargame without a pc version or playing double blind.  Ive heard rumors of a 1916 expansion through C3i.  Once confirmed I'll place my preorder.

Really, really disappointing.  Given my lack of play, I won't post this as a review, but I am never going to play it again, so the commentary is not going to change. 

I own Downtown, Burning Blue, and Elusive Victory and really enjoy them, so this should have been a homerun.  If, that is, someone had made some concessions to playability and took a machete to the chrome.  Keep in mind that I also own and play Birds of Prey, so I don't have an axe to grind over complex games.

Fundamentally, the scale of this game is too large for the detail desired.  Basically, the scale is twice what it should be, requiring the fiddly +/-0.5 markers to make up for it.  Both the 0.5 markers and wind drift are features that would be much more at home in a Fighting Wings-scale game.

The chosen scale also leads to the much bigger problem with the game:  17 of the 30 scenarios are monster campaigns of ~150 turns with 20+ squadrons flying around, each with their own objective.  150 turns is going to clock in at 12-24 hours, realistically 3+ sessions or more.  Even the Show scenarios (or partial campaign blocks) are 45-75 turns, a challenge to fit in a normal game session.  The remaining scenarios (7 Patrols) are more playable, but the one I tried (#3) was hopelessly biased towards the Germans; maybe the others are more balanced. 

Imagine how much more fun this game would be if it was zoomed in to a more narrow section of the front.  It would play much faster and you could actually keep track of what was going on. 

The root cause, IMHO, is using Downtown for most of the mechanics.  Downtown is a great game for a gorilla-package raid where air-air combat is going to be somewhat limited.  In the designer's notes for Downtown, it is specifically mentioned that the air-to-air combat is detailed because it will be rare.  A2A combat is not going to be rare in BA.  As such, playing the game takes forever, with individual planes spitting out of dogfights for even more clutter and record-keeping.

A good example of too-much complication is the artillery cooperation mission.  In artillery cooperation, you fly around the target for 3+ turns rolling dice, following a dedicated play-aid with a 5-step flowchart, and keeping notes on the artillery correction distance to remember what DRM you will be using next turn.  You also have tracking counters that get applied to the map for all this activity.  All the while, the flight has to circle around, resolving +/-0.5 markers, wind drift, archie fire, visual spotting, and tally maintains.  This is for one of the 20 squadrons you have in the air.

So, the game goes to the trade/sale pile, and I believe I will be cancelling my pre-order for Cactus Air Force - the further the designer strays from Downtown, the worse it is getting.

Needless chrome and/or bad implementation:

- there is an optional chrome table for how you get shot down (wings fell off, down in flames, etc.); I can maybe accept this but there is also errata for a DRM on the chrome table.  please.

- The altitude markers are a smaller counter than the flight counters, so if you put the marker under the plane, you can't pick them up together, and if you put it on top you can't see what plane it is.  In general, you have a stack of counters for each flight and the facing of some of the counters matter - lots of room for error.

- 8VP for a succesful arty shoot, unless you shot at a dummy arty and then it is 1VP.  IQ test - do you choose a target that can't be a dummy (trench hex), or an arty counter that you can't confirm is a dummy or not until the end of the game? 

- WWI night fighting; it occurred, but did it really impact the campaign?

- flight size modifying the search roll, esp. concerning dummy flights; mentioned only in the play example or FAQ when it is used; shouldn't this be in the rules and on the play-aid?

- sun arc as part of detection (done multiple times per turn) instead of being a combat engagement modifier (done far less frequently).

- the wind drift example makes a (somewhat) simple concept opaque.

- germans always win initiative, so british can rarely, if ever, bounce into a dogfight (the germans move first and activate it, no one else can join it for the rest of the turn).  Why can't the bouncer join in and wait for next turn to resolve it?  given that you need to track bouncers and original flights with separate fatigue markers, maybe you don't want the mental overhead anyway!

- gliding flight/dud engine - really?  the plane is going to crash and now I get to use a bunch of special rules to track it for a few turns?  includes a chrome rule for the BE2 that isn't mentioned on it's ADC.  also includes a modification to maneuverability in case it gets in air combat.  suggestion - a plane with a dud engine crashes and you move on.

- BE2's have special rules for gliding and navigation errors and this is not mentioned on their ADC.  Same for F2a/F2b's in air-to-air combat.

- dangerous dive - let's see, should I use my dive speed -0.5 safely, or get the big 0.5 bonus and damage/destroy 60% of my airplanes in the flight?  note that using your dangerous dive speed has no penalty if you use it to disengage from a dogfight, only when you use it to move.

- endurance - optional because if it was actually required to play, no one would ever finish a game.

- takeoff attrition - another ridiculous optional rule - 5% of the time a plane takes off, it crashes (..and it crashes, not aborts due to mechanical issues).  I have no idea if this is historically correct, but just say it comes out in the wash for both sides and leave it out.

- Richthofen.  A perfect example of hero-worship applied to game design.  A +5 aggression for an entire flight that is more maneuverable and has greater firepower is Deus Ex Machina, esp. considering the best any other Ace pilot could ever be is +3 (i.e. the Red Baron is more than 50% better than any allied Ace could ever be).  An easier rule would be that any flight that is adjacent to MvR is shot-down.  Same effect and it would speed up the game.  This type of over-rating is a big pet peeve.  Great pilots were not great because they were bulletproof; over-rating in this way allows you to get away with stupid things that should get you shot down.

If I were to rate a simulation that would be probably a 9 or even a 10 due to the quantity of chrome that the designer has put into this title.

But as far as it concerns a game rating I am giving it a 7. The rules are not well laid. A lot of things are unclear and some of the rules add exaggerated complexity (gliding flight!). The other issue are the counters towers. There are just to many of them and with many flight on the board the game becomes a bookkeeping challenge.  

But still, I find this game interesting. You just can feel the WW1 climate in the air while playing it.

I am sure this will scratch some of my In Clouds of Glory itch, and add the raid/operational scale, too.

I love downtown, but missed a more symmetric battlefiled - this will be more force on force.

I would like to see all the late-war types rated for this game, too! (are you listening, T-MO?) I find the pre-'18 types simply aren't as much fun to play around with, or maybe it's just because I have to have the latest tech.

In the end I didn't buy it, mainly because I had picked up The Burning Blue, and was hoping to get back to Downtown, or even building my own version of more modern conflicts

Much like GMT's Clash of Monarchs, this is a visually stunning game. From the period map to the beautiful counters, this game screams "PLAY ME!". Then you get to the confusing rulebook and say "Eh...maybe another time". The rulebook (IMHO) prevents, rather than promotes, how to play the game with the confusing lingo and overwhelming amounts of chrome.

However...

This is the internet age and there is an outstanding series of "how-to-play" videos combined with playing aids here on BGG that make up for the poorly-written rulebook. Without these aids, I would never have understood how to play this game.

Don't get me wrong. This is a fun game and one that I enjoy owning. The VASSAL mod is especially well-done too. It is just a shame that others had to finish the development work that wasn't done by the game company.

There are dogfights in this game but it is not the main point. The game is a simulation of the early air operations during the crucial period of 1917. This is a truly great game, there are some scenarios where it won't be obvious but the heart of the game is the missions for each squadron. Just watching them play out is a true joy.

This game comes with an amazing set of components that brings WW1 aviation to life. The map is beautiful and the charts are very helpful. The playbook has a variety of scenarios that will provide endless hours of play, and the generation of weather and flight sizes and skill will add to that. The rules are fairly simple to learn after a few goes, but not so complex that it bogs down the movement and action.

My only complaint is that at times the counters start stacking on top of each other and it becomes hard to see what is going on. Players will have to come up with their own system of keeping track of certain markers so as not to confuse it with unrelated pieces. It makes it easier if you play it on Vassal.

Raid level WW1 air combat.  Follow on from Downtown and Elusive Victory modified to simulate the aspects of WW1 combat.  Sort of a mix of operational and grand tactical feel.

There are a lot of rules, as well as detail, but this is an immersive experience to understand WW1 air combat from an operational perspective. Complexity is higher than DT and EV in my opinion, with play verging on tactical.  Counter clutter can be minimised by taking counters onto the logsheets - eg tally, altitude, vis id counter, etc.  

Personally I would also tailor the optional rules to use - start the planes in the air, don't use endurance or the takeoff crash rules, and try and keep the total number of flights up less than 20.

Good hunting. ;)

This game is far better than I expected. The rules are deep but learnable, the components are top notch, and the gameplay is laced with tension and seems to capture the era.

Good solo play, which is great news. I don't think any game buddies would enjoy learning or playing this beast. It's pretty intuitive once you start pushing counter around, and the rulebook does a fine job explaining game concepts. 

The map and counter artwork all look great on the table, and the operational level of  air warfare seems better suited to the material than the standard dogfighting often found.

Picked this up at the GMT booth at Strategicon and just stated reading the rules. It is a little confusing but not too bad, very exceited about the subject matter. Also being part of the same system as Downtown and Elusive Victory made this an easy buy for me.

I love the overall idea. It is an interesting time in the history of aviation. The game taught exactly why these pilots fought over the front (in comparison to most other air games of WWI where you just fight without the full picture. It is definitely good looking.

Unfortunately the height level system is convoluted and could have been easier. It reminds of the Musket and Pike system in the way that some rules appear difficult but are not, and other rules are almost superficial. The game is actually rather simple, but it takes a while to understand why it is designed the way it is. Some parts are rather irrelevant, for instance the dummy counters which have little or no effect on game play. Wind drift may be historically accurate, but has a rather irritating effect on the game as it is more cumbersome than it is important. In addition, the game bogs down if you have many flights up there, as you have to remember every single mission for every flight.

In all fairness, this is excellent for double blind play. In actual play there are a lot of "flight b discovers the opponent, thus all flights discover those the opponent" (in an era with no radios). We had a hard time figuring out if missions are hard coded or if they could be abandoned at will (apparently they can be abandoned almost at will). 

Kudos to the designer for being very active in replying to questions.

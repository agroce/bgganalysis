1 play / 3 players

LIKE: I really enjoyed the theme. The spaceman and rocket meeples are charming. I enjoyed the tile planning aspect and trying to maximize each turn before the score lap. I really liked having different end scoring options from game to game. Using rockets and red tiles to keep track of different scoring options is much better than the original Glen More.

DISLIKE: Although the tile art was good, I thought the art direction on the board was dull (people sitting around a table?). I really would have loved to see a better space illustration. Also, some of the end scoring options and lap scoring options seemed a little odd, but we haven't tried enough of them. Some icons were very small, difficult to read.

OVERALL: This was fun. Compared to Glen More, it's a winner for me. The game feels just as tight, while trying to keep the different tiles aligned and moving your astronauts around. The competitive lap scoring option (most minus least) seemed imperative to me, I probably would have found the game boring without it. Also, the die roll was innocuous (3 players), if not amusing.

I've never played the game that Lunarchitects is based on (Glen More) but having played this wonderful game of moon base planning I'm not sure I could go back to it.  I am proud to own one of the few copies of this game that will ever exist.

One solo game and one 4p game so far. Lots of fun but the strategy is very opaque, at least in early games. Getting an engine together is a slow start and sometimes doesn't work out if other people are gunning for the same tiles.

A first play - with three players.  It started seeming a little banal but after a few turns we exposed some of the hidden subtleties.  It isn't a brain-burner but it will reappear in the "options to play" from time-to-time.  (I am not sure why the theme is drawing blueprints of a lunar station rather than building the moon-station itself.)
And it has a single-player option - not yet tried.

Has been deemed a re-imagining of Glen More.  Has been some hullabaloo about saying the designer of Glen More gave his blessing on the game, then later coming out saying not so, and that it's a complete rip-off.  Whatever!  I didn't have Glen More, in fact, it was out-of-print, so I went ahead and backed this game, and thoroughly enjoy the puzzle-y nature of it.

Love the game but one weakness i find is that in 2 player skipping a tile to get one you want it usually not worth it as your opponent gets an extra tile.  The dog can mitigate this a little (if he rolls a 1).  I wish there was a consultation prize for skipping a tile to make it more appealing.

A good game. Path action selection as a good mechanics. City building is ok. Resource gathering bland. It works well, but it is all quite generic. No strong theme, nothing that really stands out from many other great games before it. Nothing that really make me want to play it again. Much like Tiny Epic galaxies. A plus for short playing time and another for how easy it is to learn. And another for the variations of goals. But not a game I will remember a few years from now.

I think I prefer Lunarchitects over Glen More.  The theme is better, its hexagonal tiles allow for more triggers, there is variable round scoring, and there is variable end-game scoring.  Lunarchitects' production value is also a step up compared to Glen More.

RATING: 9
Significantly streamlined and more configurable implementation of Glen More, with hexes instead of squares. It directly replaces the afore-mentioned for me. It doesn't quite beat out Suburbia for my favorite tile-laying game, but comes surprisingly close. It also manages to pack in a solo variant (which I haven't tried out yet).

The box insert is a work of art without peer among other standard designs. It manages to get everything stored properly, has a quick-start tray for the hexes, uses punched dividers, uses some game components as dividers (holy shit), and manages to be vertical-storage-friendly by using the punch-out leftovers. I am gobsmacked by the amount of thought that went into this thing, and can only hope that game designers/publishers take serious note.

This is Glen More, with lap scoring. How did this get made, and why isn't Matthias credited on the BGG entry? The lap scoring is silly, it causes some really lopsided scoring situations, this is not an improvement to the game, in fact it made the game feel boring.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This definitely borrows quite a bit from Glen More which I much prefer. The hexes do change up how one forms the tile map, but I'm not sure I enjoy the change much. The game tends to be higher scoring as well and there is no difference between money and points so one spends VP chits for the market - which is a difference I don't like as much either as it opens up the market considerably. Scores tend to be higher. It is a bit more variable as the end game scoring conditions are modular and randomly drawn at the start of the game. The plastic rockets amuse me. I'll play again but don't need to won.

This is a slightly lighter version of [gameid=66362]. I prefer the space theme over the Scottish smallholder theme and I really like the variable scoring goals for both the round and the game. I think that a hex layout also makes for a more interesting game than do square tiles. Just don't play it with 5 players as the "track" is too short and the choices too limited. Plays [i]great[/I] with 1-4 though.

Very glad that I Kickstartered this one.

I really like this game, but it really doesn't play very well with 5 players so as my main group is a 5 it just doesn't get to the table. However, I love pretty much everything about the game - especially the variable scoring tiles, but I don't get it to the table enough with experienced players, so I don't use the variant scoring often enough.

It's a (by design and designer admission) lighter/more accessible implementation of [gameid=66362]. I like this game, I don't really like Glen More as much

Not a bad effort. Move to a next tile, add it to your network, handle the activated tiles. End of lap scoring and end of game scoring tile. These vary to keep the game somewhat different from game to game. Glenmore reminiscent, but definitely a different game.

[b]Caveat[/b]:  The game was gifted to me by a couple of anonymous 1PG-ers along with designer [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/user/gipyls]Dan Cunningham[/url].  So take the following with whatever grain of salt you see through those rose-colored glasses.  In my "defense," I was already actively seeking a copy for myself as I felt it would be something I'd enjoy.

[u]07-Dec-2016[/u]:
[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  I'm quite impressed with the game's presentation:  from the quality of the components to the subtle but cool-looking artwork to the "fancy" insert that came with my copy (I feel bad for those of you that don't have it).  There is no wasted piece of cardboard, wood, or plastic in this box, including the empty punchboards which prop up the insert for better storage!  Even the rulebook is of really nice quality.  I can only nitpick one or two things later on.

[b]+[/b]  I do enjoy me some tile-laying goodness, and this game is all about that.  It's just fun drafting tiles to strategically place into your blueprints.  Looking for those sweet "card combos" of actions to score some VPs is the goal of the game.  And building out your final blueprint of the lunar base is satisfying once complete.  I was concerned about the game feeling samey too quickly, but after five plays in as many days, I haven't felt that.  Games are similar, sure, but I've taken a slightly different route to the endgame in each session.

[b]+[/b]  Speaking of which, there are nine endgame scoring goals available for the solo gamer.  Each one focuses on a different aspect of the game.  And while you may not go all-in on these throughout a session, you'll always have an eye on it, using it to your advantage to squeak out those few extra points.  Variety is good, and those endgame goals are what's nudged my plays into different directions from one session to the next.

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  I have to admit I was fairly disappointed to discover that the game comes with four different Lap Scoring Goals and twelve different Endgame Scoring Goals, but the solo gamer uses only [i]one[/i] Lap Goal and cannot choose two of the Endgame Goals.  The Endgame Goals are still abundant, but having four options for Lap scoring but only one that I can utilize was a letdown...but one which I hope to rectify with a variant in the near future; we'll see how it goes.

[b]-[/b]  Because of the way the solo game is tailored (and which I do [b]enjoy[/b]), there are many tiles which will [i]never ever[/i] be chosen by the player.  The main objective of the game is to score points.  The red items (tiles, rockets, and crystals) are direct points.  And yes, you'll need a few blue tiles to help (they do have actions that score VPs), but for the most part, I'd guess 60% of the tiles will never be chosen by me.  This is a Euro game after all, so efficiency will be key to victory.  Sadly, it also means I can't design the monster-sized lunar base that I so desire.

[b]-[/b]  Maybe this really isn't a negative, but I'm putting it here anyway.  It goes along with the item just above.  After only a few plays, I've already got a scripted opening move or two that I feel are obvious when playing solo.  One could certainly go another route, by choice even, but after my first learning session, I've been able to consistently score 40+ points.  So I can't say beginning the game with the same move has hurt my plays...but again, I have a very minor variant I'd like to try which may add a little spice to the first turn of the game; more to come on that in the game's forums.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  I began this list with high praise for the components.  However, I do have two nitpicks.  One is that the Rock and Astronaut pieces are very similar in color.  Sure, they're shapes are not the same, but all of the other wooden components are very distinct.  Instead of two shades of gray for those two pieces, the rock could have been black or perhaps even brown.  It would just look nicer.  And the other nitpick is the player pawns used for tile drafting.  They are okay, but when compared to the rest of the wooden "meeples," they feel a little cheap.  None of this affects gameplay though, and as I said, I'm just nitpicking because the game's production is that solid.

[b]~[/b]  So far, I've stayed away from comparisons to Glen More, but I have to mention two.  Some aspects of that game did not quite carry over to Lunarchitects.  By having hexes instead of square tiles, I feel the tile placement and Astronaut movement have been nerfed just a bit as compared to Glen More.  Because you have five open sides to a newly placed tile, there is a plethora of options for new tiles.  Astronauts don't need to be moved for better positioning as often, nor as strategically, as the Chieftans in Glen More.  I don't see this as a negative as there is still much to take into account when placing tiles to create scoring combos.

[b]~[/b]  And the other aspect is money.  In Glen More, money and VPs are separate.  Here, they are one and the same.  This means, generally, money isn't as tight as in Glen More...at least from my memory; it's been quite some time since I last played GM.  If I have chosen a starting tile for my Lunar Base that does not offer any cash to begin the game, I may feel a little struggle during that first lap.  But once I get beyond that, I really don't have any concern about buying the resources I need.  Again, I'm not putting this down as a negative as I feel they are just two different schools of thought, so to speak, rather than one being better than the other.  The decisions in Lunarchitects are still tough based on the pressing need for efficiency of tile placement.

[b]To summarize[/b]:  Yeah, I like this game quite a bit thus far.  In fact, with each consecutive session, I've enjoyed this game more than the previous one.  I'm much more familiar with the tiles now and have a better idea what to expect by the end.  I can plan better, creating a new strategy based on a late-game tile that I'd like to pick up.  As with other tile-layers (like Carcassonne or Limes or Gem Rush), I really enjoy creating that final "landscape" of whatever it is the game is themed around.  Is it perfect?  No, definitely not.  But is it fun?  Do I enjoy it?  Am I thinking about it after the game ends?  Absolutely.  So one final THANK YOU to you anonymous 1PG-ers out there and the designer, Dan, for sending me a copy of this game.  It's a keeper.

[u]21-Jan-2017[/u]:  Just a few quick comments on the solo variant I designed, [thread=1686513][/thread].  This provides the player a competitor for which to play against.  Because of this, all Lap Scoring Tiles and all Endgame Scoring Tiles are available to use, giving the player the opportunity to play closer to the feel of a multiplayer session.  The AI is controlled by the red die and only collects tiles (there is no placement needed).  Currently, I am testing a new score method that should be more consistent and less fiddly than my original design.  I think the variant is fun, provides a challenge, and increases the replay value of the game for the solo gamer.

Really great replay value on this one.  Even though it's the same stack of tiles you play through every time, the end-game scoring tiles really change the way games are played.  The art and components are absolutely gorgeous – everything from tile art to the little astronauts and rockets.  I kickstarted and bought the fancy tray, which is absolutely the best insert I've ever seen in a game.

This game also features a superb solo mode.  I play a lot of solo games, and this is probably in my top 5.

This game builds on the game Glen More in interesting ways.  You have that circular board, where the player who is behind in the path gets to take the next action. When you take an action, you move your pawn up, take the tile in the space you want, then place the tile in your tableau so that it matches the picture and is next to one of your meeples. Then you get to activate the ability on the tile you placed and all the tiles surrounding it. Four times per game you do a scoring evaluation. One of the nice things about this game is that there are multiple potential scoring criteria that get randomly determined in setup, which already gives this some additional replayability that Glen More was perhaps lacking. Turns are fast and satisfying. The board art is a little rough, but otherwise the components are great. I don't see going back to Glen More after this.

Pretty much a direct copy pf Glen More (a fantastic game) with some new scoring variants. Not a bad idea, since many people I play with were turned off by Glen More's strict scoring system. Even though you can play Lunarchitects using original Glen More rules, I have a hard time giving it praise. Personally, I prefer the tension and theme of the original, so I only need to play Lunarchitects with players who MUST have these new rules.

I had the opportunity to play test this with Dan at Gamehole Con in Madison, WI this weekend. I enjoyed the game very much!! I would call it a reasonably lightweight Euro, easy to learn and fun to play with gamers of all skill levels. I very much enjoyed the mechanic that allows you (in a way) to control the number of turns you get by moving frugally around the board. I understand that this uses most of the mechanics from a different game, which I neither knew of or have played, so I can't comment on the comparability of the two. But, I thoroughly enjoyed my playtest of this game. Dan was a great teacher, and I think that there's enough replayability that would keep this game coming off the shelf at game nights.

Quite good tile placement and resource management game. Not quite sure though why I didn't like it more than this... Maybe I was just so hammered in the first game!

We loved this game so much—it was what we had hoped Suburbia would be; we found Suburbia boring but Lunarchitects was much more enjoyable.

The production quality is great, the graphic design is wonderful, and the fancy insert works really well.

The parts that are just like Glen More are fine. The other parts are not:

1. Using hexagonal tiles instead of square tiles is not terrible but hurts the game somewhat since you now only have six spaces adjacent to a given tile instead of eight. 

2. Lap scoring... not sure I see a reason for it, and since I have no confidence this was tested properly I have no confidence it won't cause an issue.

3. No distinction between coins and other VPs - not a good idea as it ensures that anyone playing any kind of reasonable game will always be able to buy whatever they need from the market, making the game extremely loose.

4. As for the other scoring rubrics... some MIGHT work well, but some clearly don't (like the ones in our game), particularly in combination with each other. I see no particular need to play this again but if I did I would insist on scoring as in Glen More. 

I would normally rate this a 4 - it gets dinged an additional point for sleazy behavior.

Played a demo with the designer at Gen Con 2015 (using the Game Crafter components). Only had a few minutes with it before the exhibit hall closed, but very cool mechanics, theme, art, everything. In only 15 minutes we went around the track once and a had a solid grasp of the basic mechanics, even if we didn't get to see the advanced tiles or scoring (as far as I remember).

First time out with 5 players, this made a positive impression. Puzzly but not too analytical, and there are different levers to pull. I wonder if the game might go on a little too long, but maybe with fewer players that won't be a problem. Should have some legs as we explore the different scoring rules.
Kickstarted.

Fun game with mancala-type movement that dictates how many tiles you can take. Also resource management and tile placement.

Simple tile laying game, with a cool theme but a lack of player interaction. It's fun, light, ideal for non gamers, and quick for hardcore gamers.

Very simple game with several agonizing decisions: do I play the short game and grab as many tiles as I want or so I grab that time near the front, but take myself out of the next few rounds? The variable win conditions add a lot of strategy and the solo variant is a fun addition.

I played this at GameHole with the designer and its a really smooth middleweight Euro with some interesting mechanics and multiple scoring options to keep it fresh and thinky despite a fairly fast playing time.  There ended up being another Kickstarter copy in the local group so this ended up being a victim of limited shelf space in my collection though.

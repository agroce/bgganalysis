This game is about winning the right to invest in post-earthquake San Francisco (1906<). 
Bidding is done in three different ways. The game packs some elements of Blackjack, Poker and other gambling things. 
The game is pretty straight forward, and there is a small luck factor in getting money from the bank. 
Nice game, but no winner at all.

A fun game of area control and multiple bidding types, using two differing currencies. I dn't like blind bidding, but that aspect is minimal, really, and so the game is quite good. the tied-always-loses rule oelps to make some strategic choices.

A blend of several mechanics makes this one intersting,but it left me a bit flat eventhough I won. I got lucky a few times when the other two players bid the same amount, so I was the only person to build. While it worked out for me, it frustrated them greatly. I think this game plays best when you play it with a regular game group and know the other players tendencies. With strangers, this game would be completely random in the early going. 
Traded.

This is an auction game where you have to manage two different "currencies" while trying to gain control of areas of the board through winning auctions.  I've played once with four players and a large part of the board was untouched at the end of the game.  I wonder if the board fills up more with five?

Played it once, got mental whiplash from the mechanisms used to award tiles.  It's like they had a contest to see if somebody could use all the game mechanisms ever invented in one game!  Not coherent enough to be satisfying for me.

RATING: 7
Good game that keeps everyone involved most every player turn. Two methods are available to win territory, bidding money or prestige points. This allows for some flexibility. I love the high stakes bidding. Just enough gambling along with planning makes for an enjoyable game. One of those few games that can be enjoyed by gamers and the family/novice crowd alike.

Update: I finally played again. I like the O Zoo le Mio tie break rule. I'm not sure sure the money change is necessarily for the better though. I also tried neutering some of the cards, but I think the game is a bit too bland and devoid of much interest if watered down too much. Not sure where the balance is. But it's pretty basic. Down to 7.
-----
My rating of 8 is based upon MY rules of the game. The rules as written would be broken for me.
•	Official rules: when bidding with influence (Request-for-Bid card, not action card), bid with only one influence card. Any collisions result in colliding players being completely eliminated from the auction. This means that two players could collide at 9, two collide at 8, and one with the bid with 1. There just aren’t enough opportunities to build with losing bids this way, so I knew I wouldn’t like that. 
•	My rules: use an O Zoo Le Mio style of tie breaks, where you establish a totem pole of relative ordering of players (we used reverse player order, but in hindsight, I’m not sure that’s any better than normal player, or any other random ordering for that matter), and when there’s a tie, the highest player on the totem pole wins the tie and goes to the bottom of the pole. And without the severe risk of collisions, I don’t see any reason to limit the number of cards used to bid. I.e. with the official rules you would never want to bid with your highest card (9) knowing that if someone else also did that neither of you would get to build, but with the tie break, any bid limit means that whoever is winning ties can have a guaranteed win, which I don’t really like.

•	Official rules: when collecting income, draw cards until you either choose to stop, or bust by drawing cards totally over $100k. Keep what you’ve drawn only if you choose to stop.
•	My rules: with card denominations ranging from $10-100k, it feels a little too coarse to me. That is, your odds of busting when all you have is $50k are actually pretty high. Especially when you consider that most people spend their higher cards first, leaving those in the bank. But $50 is too low for income. Worse, with some people getting $100k and some people getting nothing (busting), it seems too random to me (again, not enough income events to even out over time). So, my rules are that you always draw until you bust. And then you can throw back as many cards as you want to bring yourself back to $100k or less. The idea is to give all players a chance to get reasonably close to $100k, without being too fiddly.

•	Lastly, there are two action cards I simply take out. They let you remove someone’s road and put one of yours in its place. This just felt like a little too much “take that” in a game that isn’t really about that (too few opportunities to build). All the other action cards that allow roads (I really need to remember what those sticks are actually supposed to represent) to be moved at least don’t remove anyone’s sticks.

Pro:
- slow, solid gameplay;
- easy to explain;
- I like very much mechanism of influence cards selection, where you have to predcict other player moves and select your move trying to avoid similar choice.
Cons:
- It seems a person can win by making just random moves without much thinking of what is going on.
- A lot of random.
- Several outcomes depend purely on luck.

Result:
Not a bad game for a good company.

RATING: 2
A decent idea marred by utter randomness.  It consists almost entirely of different types of blind bidding, in which any tied bids are canceled out and the next lower bid wins (for example, if 5 players bid 9, 9, 8, 8, and 0, then the person who bid 0 wins the auction!).  Getting shut out of a string of auctions leads to serious boredom while the other players take actions.  In addition, the game ends after only 12 buildings are scored -- it's easy for players to be mathematically eliminated if they don't manage to score a building or two early.

I love the auction/influence combination in this game.  With three different and distinct types of auctions, along with the need to build up influence on the various blocks on the board, things CAN get a bit nasty, but this one works VERY well with 3 players.

Not a bad game. Interesting use of bidding mechanics - basically felt like a board game version of For Sale. Simple to teach and learn. Unfortunately, the one play we had was with so many modified rules that we ended up changing the feel of the game and phase order became a huge muddle. 

A game I will be happy to play again, but nothing to write home about.

There is something I don't like about this game: so many different kind of auctions yet they all feel the same. The weird idea of having identical bets cancel out just feels wrong in a game like this. The game works, but it's not exciting nor does it have any strategical depth.

If you like auction games, you'll love San Francisco.  Three different auction mechanisms are melded into each and every round.  Lots of strategy involved and the resource management (money AND prestige) can get downright painful.  I'm a big auction game fan, so this one rates an 8.

RATING: 7
A bidding game that features different kinds of bidding that mostly aren't so straightforward firstly because of the fact that players' bids can cancel each other and secondly because renewing your influential and monetary power isn't so easy. Quite a lot is left for chance, but there is still a lot of room for considering your moves and effective play demands the using up of your resources during the game. Of note is also the fact that the game gets really fast towards the end as almost each turn during the late game sees at least one building erected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game gets an extra low rating because it is the worst implementation I have seen of my least favourite mechanic, blind bidding. It is so random that it just frustrates me whether I get lucky or not. For example, let's say three people really want something and happen to tie in the bidding at 8. The person who doesn't want it as much might win it for a bid of 1. While the game might reward number analysis if rivals always bid an obvious number anybody who has any sense won't do this most of the time. As a result actions could just as effectively be granted through dice rolling rather than a meaningless auction. Another obvious problem with the game is that one player can quickly build an insurmountable lead while another gets shut out. I have played San Francisco just once but that is enough. It is a good test of clairvoyance and not much else.

Different kind of auctions in a one game AND the game works fine. A quite enjoyable game where even blindbidding -rounds works well. Couple of playability issues, but you can handle those as well. San Fransicso was a positive surpise for me.

RATING: 5
It has two types of auctions (open with money and blind bids with influence) and a tense interactive grid of laying investment lines (sticks).  The auctions are interesting as well as the board tension but the recovery of the two types of currencies (money cards and influence) is kind of random.  It made me wish I were playing a better, more fun auction type of game.  I really think it needs some variants or some rules to re-balance the randomness effects for it to be more solid game.  If you don't mind randomness thrown into your auctions, then you might like this.

RATING: 7
This is an all auction game with a centralized board for player interaction. Many have panned it for just being a series of auctions but the central board holds a subtle majorities game. I think that the underexposure this might have gotten when it was released meant that when most people had a chance to play it there were "more interesting" games out there...however I still enjoyed the heck out of it.

The only other games that I love that are also in this category are Modern Art and Fist of Dragonstones.

A few people write this one off because of the blind bidding elements when their is an influence auction... I don't mind that mechanic at all.  This game has great interaction... and the game can rapidly come to a close so staying in the lead or close to the leader is critical. Missing one Request for Bidding opportunity can cost you the game.  Wonderful.

Weird game really. Auction after auction to place single fences on streets on the board in order to get a majority of streets around a block. Once you have a majority, you score the block for VPs. Then an event tile gets drawn which may give money back or more usually involve yet another auction to move fences around, allowing you to re-use fences which may say be between two scored blocks and no longer useful. The auctions vary between normal round and round, rock/paper/scissors (with a blind bid resolution on ties) and Raj style simultaneous reveal with ties being knocked out. The prevalence of the latter 2 makes for fun, but of course makes many results fairly random as well, so it's hard to take the game seriously. Making for a problem because who wants to play something you can't take seriously for a game of this length (60-90 minutes). And who wants to do nothing but auctions for that long as well. In short, the mechanics don't sustain the length.

If you can't handle blind bidding, then steer clear of this one.  I'm not a huge fan of the mechanic, but there is just so much to like about this that I try not to worry about it.  First, I like that the system itself is interactive, and thereby a little mean.  The two currencies work well here. I do fear, as a result the player by closing out lots early on, that a more fortunate player has a significant advantage later in the game. They are allowed to move pieces or to cash pieces in for more resources.  Often a close will come from a fluke.  The huge swings in bids are a little staggering and irregular. One player can walk away with six points for nothing and another can spend their entire wad.  

I can only assume that experienced players will truly understand the proper values of things, but I can also imagine as proper assessments are better reached, the higher the likelihood of kooky ties in the blind bidding.  Frustrating, but strangely compelling, and I have to say it is fun for me. 

FYI, why they didn't just put the numbers on the cards will always bug me.  Terrible graphic collaboration!

RATING: 6
A really fun bidding game where you take on the role of an investor after the earthquakes of 1908, trying to rebuild the city. You bid on investing in blocks that border city tiles in a grid. The layout and pieces are very similar to Santiago (grid with tiles but streets instead of canals). The bidding happens by flipping over a bid card and you can bid on the tile type shown in one of three ways shown: 1. blind bid with influence cards 0-9, if tie in influence, ties get nothing 2. open bid with money 3. blind bid with city type tiles. 1 could have multiple winners, 2 has one winner and 3 could have multiple winners. Once someone has the majority of investment around a piece of property (there are 4 sides), the tile flips and it triggers a year card which rewards everyone in the game or allows for another investment with one winner. The game reminded me of Chinatown except a tad lighter and more luck thrown in. Would defintely play again.

Somehow all the varied bidding mechanics and game mechanisms come together in San Francisco to form a cohesive and entertaining game. There's an awful lot going on here, but rather than ending up a Frankenstein game of stitched-together design components, it holds together very well. Update: OK, I admit that there are a LOT of auctions here, which may not appeal to some players. Perhaps for this reason, I can't seem to get San Francisco off the shelf and onto the table. As a result, rating has been nudged down a notch to 6 and the game is now on the trade pile.

Variant to try: when there is a tie at the blind influence auction, tied winners have one minute to make a deal and decide which one of them wins the auction. Compensation may be paid. If they cannot agree, next highest bid wins.

RATING: 7.5
Had a lot of fun playing it. Light risk-taking game that builds in intensity. My only real quibbles are with some of the components. The action cards come in five colors, one per player. The dark blue cards are almost totally indistinguishable from the purple cards, and the red cards are hard to tell apart from the brown cards. Since you only have to make sure each player has one set, we fixed this by painstakingly (in the case of blue and purple) separating the four sets, and putting the purple and brown in a baggie. If we play four or five players, I only have to note who got the "baggie" cards.

Kickstarted

All I really have to say about this is that for a free game I got for backing another Kickstarter its not a bad little push your luck game. Theme wise the game works well, your students at a bomb squad school learning how to defuse bombs. Cutting wires and not setting off points gains you points, blowing up looses you points. Made for a thematic and enjoyable game.

I won this at a game day at Weber College Library. 
Fun second questing game to diffuse bombs. I love second guessing games. I think they are fun and interactive. I also think there are too many of them on the market. 

This is a good game but when it comes to second guessing games, but I would rather re-visit my old games that I have been playing for years instead of Bomb Squad Academy. 

If you are new to second guessing games, this is a great game for your collection. If you already play and own several second guessing games play before you buy.

Out of my collection....

A sort of push your luck-type game that seems like it'd play better with more people. Only done 3-player so far, want to try with 4 or 5.

Would rate a bit higher, but it seems to take a while to play for just being a push-your-luck game.

Bomb Squad Academy是與Bomb squad 驚爆時刻一起集資收到的遊戲，雖然看起來是個附加的卡片小遊戲，但我覺得他的表現比主遊戲更加的亮眼，小小的盒子裝著滿滿的配件，遊戲的機制和帶入的感覺不輸給Bomb squad，只可惜國內外甚少人討論，在試跑了幾次卻讓我越來越喜歡它 ~
玩家扮演拆彈學院的學生，在期末考時必須學習怎麼樣小心翼翼的拆除炸彈，遊戲進行三輪，每輪都有四顆炸彈讓玩家選擇剪線，每次剪爆彈就一輪結束，玩家同時選擇手中的牌決定要剪哪顆炸彈的引線，剪下去沒引爆可以得到分數，一顆炸彈剪越多次分數就越高，彈引爆的機率也會相對提高，一起剪同一顆炸彈除了分數會平分，爆彈也會一起扣分~
這是個簡單又糾結的管理風險遊戲，遊戲中還添加了許多OP的工具以及加分機制讓落後的玩家更有機會翻盤，每次單獨剪線未爆彈得分的心情總是特別雀躍，尤其是炸彈引線越剪分數越多，內心也越糾結，是一款很不錯的遊戲~

Lovely push your luck game with a  lot of detail. Mechanically it's push your luck combined with hidden action selection and - in the more experienced version - special one time action. Almost all information is open so it's a really good, thinkful push-your luck-game which is way before it's time. The more players the less opportunities to not interfere each other...

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

It is a fine filler. My biggest gripe would be the tools - selecting the tools takes more time than the game itself as everyone reads through what's available when its their turn to select from what's left in rounds 2 and 3. Otherwise, there's some interesting game play decisions to make regarding which circuit you cut. There is a fair bit of luck of the draw in the circuitry and what points might score but you do know the odds ahead of time as the circuit card backs show the spread of card values in the deck.

The Bomb Squad Academy components are nice. Gameplay was ok. It didn’t feel thematically tense like I hoped. I have yet to play FUSE, but maybe it would be a shorter, better game in the same vein. (Much like dating, it’s never a good sign when you’re playing a game and thinking about another game.)

Surprisingly fun after several plays. Unfortunately it's particularly fiddly to set up and between rounds. Made much more fun when playing with several players if they can all help to set up.
Scoring tokens are a (fun/annoying - delete as appropriate) puzzle as they're double sided (1/5, 10/20 and 50/100). It's very easy to forget which ones you've worked out you need to flip and which ones you need to exchange every time you score points.

Provisional Rating. A surprisingly fun push your luck game. Only one 2P game thus and suspect it will be much better with 4-5 players. Given the small box, easy to teach rules and quick playing time I can see this being a regular filler at our gaming nights.

Based on one play: A simple push your luck game with a little bit of take that. You try to defuse bombs, all players at the same time without having them explode, however is others push their luck on the same bomb as you then it may go off or if you just get unlucky. Fairly simple and the theme is cute but it was not really enjoyed by anyone, there are much better games to play in this genre.

I love Simultaneous card selection games anyway so this was easily a top game of the month for me. You are trying to cut the wires and not set off the bomb. By out witting the other players you collect points. It is quite a fun game. Better played with 4+ players and it plays pretty quickly. Very much enjoying this one.

A cool, well-developed push your luck card game about disarming bombs.  LOVE the fact that this game is meant to select the start player for the more intricate (and thematically related) Bomb Squad.  More companies should do this...but only if they've put together a complete game the way BSA is.  It is fun on its own, but even cooler when you consider the integration into the larger "game world" of Bomb Squad.  
Get both if the theme interests you, and you enjoy legacy and/or campaign style games.  
I haven't played it yet, but I own and am looking forward to playing Bomb Squad a little bit more because of how fun this game is.

In this game each player has a hand of 6 cards.  4 are clippers for one of the four colors of bombs, the other two are special actions.  Players will take turns simultaneously playing one of these cards.  Each player who plays a colored clipper turns over cards from that same color bomb in the center of the table.  The numbers on these cards score those players points (shared among all who played that color) as well as progress along a track, at the end of which the bomb will go off ending the round and losing triggering players points.

This is a good filler game with a decent amount of depth.  The basis of which is trying to figure out what the other players will play in any given round.  The previous two cards played by each player is visible giving you partial information and toward the end of a round there are also press-your-luck elements involved.  Very well designed.

The only thing I would mention is my one play of this game was with 5 players.  I think you should aim for that as often as possible as with lower player counts decisions become easier and some of the edge of the game is filed off.

There's a segment of the hobby that half-jokingly knows me as the gamer who doesn't like games.  In my defense, I don't like 90% of games because that's the exact percentage that are pointless minor variations on other games/mechanics.

If you solicit my game participation with a 10-second description, there's a chance that I will politely refuse your invitation because I have played a *ton* of games and can accurately predict whether I will hate the cardboard darling that you cradle in your arms.  I'm doing both of us a favor, honestly: I get to avoid a game that I loathe (or simply tolerate), and you can play with someone who won't spend their turns trying to end the game as quickly as possible.

My ludographic philosophy isn't a mystery. I cherish games that are truly original, not broken, fairly interactive (in a thoughtful way), have clear rules, and are neither too long nor too short for their complexity level.  Being "fun" is a big plus, but being mentally satisfying is also acceptable. Recent examples: Evolution, Triumph and Tragedy, Thunder Alley, Star Wars Risk, Space Cadets: Away Missions, Codenames, Baseball Highlights 2045, Welcome to the Dungeon, and now Bomb Squad Academy, 

Admittedly, if you choose to play BSA with the Tool cards, they're swingy and can determine the winner.  But the game is short and light enough that it really (emphasis on the really) doesn't matter.

RATING: 7
Played a three player version of this a couple of times.  One of the players told me that he enjoyed the game afterward.  I couldn't tell if he was serious, but I knew that since he was the guy with whom I always argue when we play monopoly, I figured any encouragement outside of Monopoly was probably legitimate.  I was fond of it too, probably because of my childhood love of modular space stations.  I think it's out of print now, unfortunately.

Plays best with 4, 3 is Okay, never tried it with 2 but I don't think it would be fun.  See my review for my detailed analysis but in short I think this is brilliant, if it had Knizia written on the front cover it would sell by the barrow load.

Not quite sure about this game -- the money just doesn't seem to move around much. The instructions suggest starting with 50 and playing 'til someone is out -- now that would have taken quite some time! Of course, the instructions also say each round should take 20 minutes or so and we were whipping through them in 2 or 3.

Unlikely to play again, but it's always nice to finally play a game you've owned for 12 years or so but never played.

Dull.  I will play this one, but only after some serious prodding.  I guess the appeal is the price, because it seems to me that there is very little game here. It is definitely light, but unlike many other GOOD light games, it doesn't seem to be very fun.

Fun, fillery, Cheapass.  I think this is probably my favorite Cheapass game (admittedly, I've only played about four).  Somehow, despite the number of games in the room, we never have the right distribution of money chips (borrowed from other games) to play this!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
25+ plays (10x3p 15+x4p - different groups, each play could be many rounds) - fun hand management, tile laying & a bit of gambling... what an interesting combination of elements.  I'm still figuring out the smart plays, risk taking, double-guessing (for deferments), tricky tile maneuvers... The time flew by while playing and drinking wine with wild talk and domino type table slapping.   Update: Advanced game thought... the capsule possibilities are not equal; for example the "Play 2 Cards" power is much less possible to achieve (1 specific tile matched to any of 2) than the "Collect $2 for EndCaps" power (2 specific tiles can be matched to any of 3 specific tiles).  I've played a few hands with the advanced game now-the advanced powers seem easier to achieve than I expected, and create new challenges and strategies. Connection fee build cost is a heavy hitter.  Power to play 2 cards double edged as it is a serious station-closing threat power (multi endcaps for example), but your hand shrinks (one player used over and over, shrinking down to 2 cards). I made a wooden tile version. Update: last game played I almost had to dance like a robot, our penalty for running out of dough. Update2: I tentatively think that the game with 3p is not as good as with 4p.

A solid bluffing/gambling game.  I've used up one copy and am on my second (and third!).  Out of print but rumors say it will come back in a snazzy new "Hip Pocket" format.  [Further rumors say it was going to be too expensive to produce, so no new version.]

RATING: 7
Although somewhat similar in mechanic to A Very Clever Pipe Game, this one seems to work better.  There is a little more strategy and a lot more mechanic due to the access fees for crossing another person&#039;s section of starbase and the ability to sabotage.

RATING: 4
1st played 11/08/07. Takes <5min to learn & 30min to play ~8 rounds (4 players). We were board after 30 mins. Rounds take 5-10min. In a space pod connection game, players start with 5 cards from his own deck (decks are same) & $50. Cards range 7-0 in value, with the higher cards having more connections & cost(during placement). Sabotage(7; destroy a card), Power Plant(6; only one), Habitat(5). Factory(4), Laboratory(3), Communications(2), Docking Station(1), Recreation(0). 2-0 are end caps(1 conn) & pay you $1 for placement. On a turn, players pick a card(hidden) & reveal simultaneously. Matching cards are deferred to later rounds. Player with highest card value remaining places 1st (plus deferred cards) on station. Placing next to another color's pod requires $1 payment to that player if you placed other pod(s). You also pay $1 for each pod you pass through. Each player places then the next round begins. Rounds end immediately when all pods are capped. Deferred cards pay $1 to the pot. Player ending round wins pot. Decent balance of luck & strategy. Great concept, however rounds ended quickly & generally left us wanting more. Recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it, however at $5-6 I wouldn%u2019t bother purchase.

It's so easy to not stop playing with two players -- it can take most of an afternoon to eliminate someone's cash.  (The last few chips are the hardest.)  My first four-player game was a disappointment, but when I played with two other serious players and a new player (instead of two new players) I found that the randomness of play opportunities that were a problem before were gone.

EXCELLENT gambling game for nights when people just aren&#039;t up for the poker staredown. Everyone can come with nickels and buy in for $2.50 or, if you&#039;re used to a higher stakes game, use quarters for credits and buy in for $12.50.

The game is great for the card-counting strategies, the map-building and region-control strategies, the dash of luck and the forethought and planning that can develop. The only downside is that it&#039;s nearly impossible to laminate your own cards reliably so that they don&#039;t come out marked and the cards only came as paper to begin with. (But hey, it&#039;s a Cheapass game anyhow.)

Taking Raj a step further. Each player has a set of 20 tiles, from the 6 rated 4 pronged module to the 0 rated 1 pronged module, plus there’s a 7 rated sabotage card that allows you to kill off part of the built starbase. Simultaneous revelation of 1 card each, highest rating places their module card onto the playing surface to start building the starbase and then the other cards build off that. Play successive rounds, winner will be the person who finishes the starbase by closing off the last available prong. This isn’t easy to do as you have to play a low card (only 1 prong), which means going last in the round, and the other players playing before you will try and ensure there’s more than one open prong by the time it gets to you. The trick is to get into ties with other players - which forces you to pass and play your card next round with your next card, therefore placing two tiles at once. 

We wanted to explore this again in the future as it was interesting; not sure whether the importance of ties means the winner will be largely luck-based.

This is the second Cheapass game I've tried, and our group thoroughly enjoyed it.  The multiple paths to financial victory (not just an endgame closure) really add to the enjoyment and replayability.  On the downside, the thin cardstock is very difficult to shuffle effectively, and the "ranking" of the cards could use a tweaking IMHO to add a little variety to hands.  A very enjoyable game, overall.  We'll be replaying it often.

Not worth your time.  The components, of course, are crap, as to be expected with anything released by [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/12/cheapass-games]Cheapass[/url].  The art's actually decent, which is a change.  The gameplay for this one is pretty chaotic and boring.  Might be better at two than with three, which is what I played it at.  Still, seems that the person who caps the spaceship is going to run away with it.  Choices were near meaningless, far as I can tell.  Seems like there could be a good abstract game with these mechanics, but this sure ain't it.

Starbase Jeff is a pipe-laying game where players maximize their profits by strategically placing and building onto sections of a starbase. Whoever makes the most money by the end of a given number of rounds wins the game. Any number of rounds can be played with each round lasting approximately 20 minutes. Money in the form of play money, chips, etc is required to play. The components include a set of rules and four sets of identical starbase section cards in four different colors.

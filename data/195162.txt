I enjoyed this - save the event cards, which brought in additional unpredictability beyond the dice and the card draw. Some were devastating in the right situation and skewed the results of the game in a major way. If I was to play again, some (or all) would have to be removed.

Got this in the mail on Friday after the kickstart packages were sent out. Played it Sunday morning with a friend and my fiancee. All three of us ended up VERY much enjoying the game and had a good laugh about how our diseases took very sudden dark turns (Like going from sweating symptoms to suddenly having seizures, or having a cough and sore throat leading into cannibalism).

I ended up getting second place to my fiancee who was waaaay faster on the draw for the tiebreakers in final scoring. I will probably be busting this out for the one player variant soon and we'll see if I can get some 2 players in as well. 

I recommend this game as a light, turn-based game with simple mechanics, hilariously dark undertones, and a good gateway into some higher-weight games.

Love this game and the computer game it's based on. Some rules are quite fun (player who last washed their hands goes first and in the event of a tie first player to drop to the ground and pretentious to be dead wins). Companion app that goes with it is very helpful and prevents the need for a calculator. Only issues I have is the games a little bare bones right now and the single player version is either really hard or really easy but if the game get enough support they plan to add more stuff. Definitely worth the buy

I have 2 different gaming groups. A smaller family group that like lighter games that can be played with family that aren't gamers. Ticket To Ride, Pandemic, 7 Wonders are about the most advanced they go. Everyone in the group enjoyed this one instantly one of them even suggesting playing a game of Plague Inc to infect the world and then we need to play Pandemic to try and reverse it. 
My other gaming group is a mix of light through heavy gamers and even some wargamers. I just had this in my bag and someone wanted to play something quick before the night was over so we broke this out taught them in about 5 minutes and we finished in just about an hour. It was interesting enough for some of them to want to want a copy for their friends/family who are not into really heavy games. 
As of writing this we have played 6 times with mostly the same group.

I did realy like the game! God gameplay light complexity and easy to teach other players.
There is some strategies to the game and some randomness but i do like that in this game, it would be wrong in any other way.
I do not know why people complain about the quality of the cards, I think they are fairly high quality, better than many other games I purchased.
I like the artwork and components.
The only thing i feel is a bit down is the every component to the game is so small, i would like everyting to be about 20-30% bigger.

Very good game. One of my and my friends' favorites. We play it a lot.
It looks very complicated first, but it is pretty easy to learn. 
The game is easy on new players. Players who played this game a lot don't have a winning advantage. Still, there is only a little luck involved. Also, it is possible for a seemingly loosing player to come back into the game, so it stays fun for everyone. (Halfway the game, my mother in law was so far behind we felt sorry for her, but didn't give mercy. Still, she ended in 2nd place out of 5 players.) 
I always sleeve my cards, so the game stays clean and nice looking. Also shuffeling becomes easier with sleeves. There is enough room in the box to store the sleeved cards. The cards are non standard sized, so they are in a little to long sleeves, but that doesn't bother me.
Funny fact: in the game rules book, they apologise for using the word dice (as in death dice) as a singular. They joked a 'death die' was too confusing.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on one solo play so far.  An interesting game that is faithful to the digital adaption.  AI trait mechanism felt a bit overpowered coupled with the higher scoring rules made it feel like the player was at a serious disadvantage.

Will have to give it additional plays at some point to explore more, but not in any particular hurry.

Kickstarted

Plague Inc. is a kickstarter game produced by the company and creator of the Plague Inc. app. A game where you take on the role of a vicious virus trying to wipe out the earth, this boardgame and the app play very similarly, to the point where its the first boardgame based of an app that I can think of. Game play is thematic and enjoyable but the event cards are overpowered. Still, its one of the better games that I've gotten from kickstarter.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Amusing, if still slightly flawed game. It reminds me a bit of Evolution, in that you are "upgrading" your disease with adaptations to help it survive and spread across the globe (it actually made me think a world-map expansion to Evolution: Climate could be awesome.) 

All in all, the game works well, but it still feels like a cheap, mass-market game. Components are flimsy, graphic design isn't great, and the mechanics could have used more development. The almost completely card-driven nature of the game still means players are at the mercy of the draw: sometimes the game stalls because you really need a particular trait, but no trait cards come out for a long time. I have never played the video game, so the IP and theme have no real impact/appeal to me.

I wasn't familiar with the video game, so I had no preconceived ideas on this.  Infect the world with your bacteria or virus, trying to eliminate the most countries while boosting your virulence or lethality and adapting to hot and cold climates.  This lasted longer than I would have liked, but I believe that will improve with further plays as the actions become more familiar.

My expectations for Kickstarter games has been lowered quite a bit.  I have backed so many games that looked really cool but ended up being just so so. This was a wonderful exception. 

Area control with some fun strategy options that don't lead to analysis paralysis. So far, just played with 2 players. I am not sure I am sold on the event cards because thy are imbalanced and can really bonk you. 

I will be trying 3 or 4 players with event cards and a 2 player without event cards. They make it fun, but can really create a disproportionate separation between players. 

One of my top 10 favorites from 2016.

Amazing board game, I really liked the pc version and was in two minds whether the board game would deliver the same amount of fun but I love it. I've taught it to multiple people within my game group and they've all been eager to get it back to the table. It's more frequently referred to by them as "Anti-Pandemic."

    The component quality is top notch from the plague marked player markers to the blood speckled death dice. Highly recommended

It's an interesting theme, but it's just too luck dependent -when a player has 5 lethality, and keeps rolling 6's three turns in a roll with little in the way of chance mitigation, it's just not fun. For what it's worth, we rather enjoyed the middle part of the game when everyone got some good traits and is destroying the world at a relative constant pace. But the first third took too long to build-up and the latter third lasted too long for the kind of game it is. 

If there's a way to reduce the luck, shorten the engine-building time and tighten the end game, then it might be a better game, but as it is.... eh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
2016-06-19 : First play and maybe just because my expectation level was low I kinda liked it. It's a double area majority game with an engine building component where you've got to consider a whole lot of things in order to play well. Played it with 2, but I can see this doing even better with 3, so potentially this game could rise to be an 8
2018-02-02 : 2nd play - this time with 4 players - and again the experience was enjoyable. The clear graphics and layout and the excellent player board/aid certainly added to it. Not deep enough and a tad too random to make it to an "8" but it's a solid "6"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plague Inc surprised me. I had played the app quite a few times, but quickly grew tired of it, finding it random and repetitive. However, the same is not true for its board game adaptation. Players still apply traits to their bacteria/virus, but this process has been drastically refined. Where the original app had a daunting amount of upgrade paths, the board game only has four trait types; tranmission, climate resistance, infectivity, and lethality. Transmission and resistance traits have niche utility, but players will primarily focus on infectivity and lethality, and the two balance themselves incredibly. Infectivity is the clear early game focus, as they help your disease propagate throughout the globe, but soon your pool will diminish and you'll need to kill off a country in order to fully utilize your infectivity. This creates a nice narrative arc of spreading fast and then killing fast, but if a player commits too strongly either way they leave themselves open to risk. The area control mechanisms are simple, but add to the balance of infectivity and lethality. Surprisingly, this game is far better than the app ever was.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kickstarter.  A pleasant surprise.  Area control and hand management are the primary mechanisms in play and the theme is pure awesome.  

It feels like there might be something really good here, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get past the swinginess of the event deck and the randomness of the card draws.  It feels like... with just a little nudge in the right direction this might have been a real tense and meaty strategy game.   

Even if it's exactly as it appears, I'm glad I have it, and it'll be fun to break out from time to time.

Relatively short and sweet board game with thematic components and gameplay. The game moved a little too fast and it was almost too easy to make decisions.

Thematically, it's Pandemic from the point of view of the diseases. Mechanically, it's a competitive game of engine building and area majority. Neither the theme nor the mechanisms excited me, and I feel the game was hurt by too many random elements -- the mutation draws, the country draws, the event draws, and the dice rolling to see if cities were eliminated.

[Kickstarted - Plague Enthusiast Pledge]

This game is just as fun as I expected it to be. So far I have only played with 2 players (and only using the bacteria slide), but I think this game would be great for a group.

The rules are very easy to understand and we only needed to use the rule book for one turn each before we stopped relying on it (only opening it again to double check what to do in specific situations). The turn actions are intuitive, and if you ever forget what you're supposed to be doing your disease slide has all the info you need on the right hand side to remind you.

We were very pleased with the quality of the board, cards and pieces that came with the game. The board is thick and sturdy, there is nice detail on the plastic pieces, the cards feel nice and seem like they will stand up to regular use. Like some have said, it would have been nice if the disease slides had been a little thicker/more sturdy, but as long as you don't abuse your game it should hold up just fine and is nice quality.

Overall this is the anti-Pandemic board game I was hoping it would be and am very pleased with the final product. I recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the app/video game, as well as anyone looking to add something interesting to their game collection. Also, if you enjoyed the Pandemic games and are looking for something thematically similar that turns the tables to try, this one's for you.

RATING: 6
Really interesting concept however it simply does not work well with 5 players. 

I love the concept and I like the way you gradually evolve your virus and are attempting to take over different countries, however the game is very luck dependant, I failed to roll death repeatedly despite a fairly high lethality (4) whilst my neighbour with only a lethality of 1 killed a couple of early countries and catapulted himself up the scoreboard. Frustrating!

The event cards you get for killing countries are not balanced at all. Some are incredibly powerful and some are so circumstantial, and you must jump through so many hoops that they are not worth bothering with.

Finally we found the second stage of the game, once all countries are gone and you keep playing until somebody cant, really really drags out, it is almost half the game length! and in that portion of the game you are basically doing the same action over and over.

I enjoyed it, however with the full compliment of 5 players the crack started to appear in the kickstarter veneer and actually the game could have done with a bit more playtesting and a bit more development

Simple, some nice art and mostly fair gameplay. 
The final scoring occasionally feels like it has gone totally against the run of play, eg, I recently won a game 102:81 but had suggested to the other player that I didn't see any point in adding up the scores because I had been hammered!

Wasn't sure how the crossover from phone apps & pc would be so I bought the game. After going through the rules I found the game is as close to the app as possible, and enjoyed playing it.  
I took it to my local Gaming Club and played a 3 player game, it was a bit of a battle but my friend won.  They both said they enjoyed the game and would play it again, and so will I.
Looking forward to some expansions now.

I would advise buying the game, it has enough strategy to keep everyone happy and the rules are not to hard to learn

Wow, very fresh, clean and smooooth-playing.

Yeah, the specific elements of the game are not original, but somehow their mix seems refreshing.

Unfortuately there is a serious luck involved here.  As user Paladin5891 neatly put it:
[i]"Drawing the right trait cards at the right time, getting a juicy country right when it is your turn, drawing the most powerful event cards right when you need them, and getting low-rolls on the death-die can all hugely impact your score in this game".[/i]

Probably the luck factor and the smoothness of the game make it too light for my taste, but I would like to give it one more try before the final judgement.

This game is essentially "reverse Pandemic" where you want to spread diseases across continents. Mechanically its an area control game. The take that element from event cards can get quite crazy at times. How you do in this game very much depends on the other player's actions which I didn't really like. Overall its not a bad game but at the same time its also not a great game. Strangely enough the game reminds me of  El Grande.

Fantastic game! I love to play this immediately following a good game of Pandemic - save the world together, then destroy it alone! It's a very additive game, with each player investing in themselves and improving their disease. It is easy to take pride in how you are doing without getting too frustrated that you're "falling behind". There are enough "take that" actions and strategies to enjoy without permanently crippling friendships or derailing someone else's gameplay. In fact, in the times I've played it has almost always been up in the air through to the final moves to see who will come out on top.

This is a very cool game. The trait and event cards are thematic and it's fun trying to kill off the world rather than saving it for a change. There is just enough "take that" to keep it interesting and prevent you from getting too comfortable. The components for the game are great and it looks good on the table. This was a real winner of a Kickstarter project; even delivered on time.

I'm part of gaming charity group and in December, we had to spend hours and hours each day at a bar, trying to win their prize - their entire monthly profit (We won! $18,030.17!).  Drinking by itself gets old after a while, so we played lots of boardgames.

I'd had this for a while and finally remembered to bring it up to play.  My friends and I were instantly hooked.  It's so much fun, that we could play for hours on end, making the days so much easier to get through.

It's an easy game to pick up, but it still requires strategy to play.  I've taken it to other events we've put on since and every one enjoys it.  I plan to make it a highlight of next month's game night, along with Secret Hitler.

Seriously, this game is a blast.  Get it as son as you can.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Six might be generous - not sure yet but since my first play is probably also an anomaly, we'll see. There is quite a bit of randomness in the game with the die roll (I wasn't happy failing 8 straight rolls where I had a 50-50 shot of success and it set me back where I don't think I was able to come back - but we also had a run away leader because he rolled two 1s early for two early country kills which jumpstarted his game. The game certainly has the feel of the app! Africa is really hard to get into as most countries there do not have an airport or seaport.

Some nice touches around the need to get good traits to help your disease spread to hot, cold countries and to different continents.

We really wanted to like this, as we're big fans of the Plague iOS app.  However, the game was much lighter than we normally play and a lot of it felt too luck based, from the lethality rolls to the starting cards drawn.  Drawing US with harbor and airports, versus a country with no transportation connections is a big difference.

After our first game, the unanimous decision was that this would've been more fun as a co-op.  Much of the game was blocking and trying to eliminate an opponent from an area, which quickly establishes Plague as a very mean game.  Much moreso than something like Terraforming Mars.  Overall, this is a game about tearing down rather than building up, so I guess it's to be expected.

Kickstarted it when my oldest introduced me to the mobile game after we played Pandemic.  Loved the KS campaign, and we've enjoyed the challenge each time we've had it out.  Definitely need to be in the mood to win by utterly destroying the world.  If you can get in that mind-set of total area control and the darkly themed undertone, you'll enjoy it.

I bought this game on Kickstarter. It is fun, but I find it gets frustrating and repetitive after several plays. 

There is too much chance involved for my liking. In the games I played, if someone had good dice rolls they won, and if someone had bad dice rolls, they lost. There is also no good mechanic to balance out the game. If someone gets ahead early on (with some lucky rolls), they can often stay far ahead the whole game. 

Quality and design of the board, cards, and tokens was good. Although the font could have used some more creativity.

But it is still enjoyable to play a few times, and I thought was a good adaptation of the video game. But I probably won't be going back to play it too often, unless others ask.

Sok jót hallottam felőle, úgyhogy gondoltam kipróbálom előbb az appot, aztán meglátjuk, hogy beszerzésre kerül-e a táblás verzió. Hát, nem fog...

Lehet, hogy nem kellett volna az appot megnézni, mert egyszerűen kiábrándító volt (vagy csak én vártam sokat). Már eleve a téma is olyan szürreális (fordított Pandemic), de a megvalósítás, a mechanika és a játékélmény sem tetszett (mivel utóbbiról vajmi keveset tudnék írni).

Ha pontoznom kellene az app alapján, akkor úgy 4-5 pont körül lenne, de egyrészt úgy gondolom, nem lenne fair, másrészt meg valószínűleg táblásban azért ennél csak élvezetesebb a játék. Úgyhogy inkább nem pontozom...

Viszont megvenni sem fogom, kiábrándultam belőle.

Surprisingly solid area control game. I like how you build a tableau of cards to improve your virus, and the way the map expands is really neat. Sort of felt like a distant cousin to Campaign Manager/Sola Fide. The dice rolling to eradicate countries felt slightly awkward and tacked on, but otherwise I really enjoy this game. Just not sure if I have any more room for these lighter area control games on my shelves.

I love the theme and the game.

However, I change two points in the rules, to speed up the game and to remove the negative frustration :

1 / When a player fails to pass all his Lethality tests during his turn, he receives a +1 marker (max 3 at the same time front of him). He have to necessary to use them to reach a next test. Whether he uses 1 or 2, he will lose them all.

2 / Set-up starting with for each, at random: +1 Lethality / +1 Infection / +1 boat / +1 flight  OR  in stead : A Muligan
It's very frustrating to start his first round of play by discarding his cards.

Played at DTC 2017.  This game was alright, but I think it needs more than two players to shine.  Since we normally play with two, I was not too excited with it.  Game play is straight forward and the game presents similar to the app, but I prefer the app method of play.

RATING: 5
A 1-4 player game that allows you and your friends to compete to see who has the most dangerous virus or bacteria while attempting to wipe out the entire human race!

Although the premise and overall mechanics are well-designed, the game suffers from very high reliance on luck. Drawing the right trait cards at the right time, getting a juicy country right when it is your turn, drawing the most powerful event cards right when you need them, and getting low-rolls on the death-die can all hugely impact your score in this game and cause even the best-laid plan to fall apart and the least skilled player to win by a landslide.

If it weren't for the huge luck-factor, I would recommend this game quite highly. As it is though, this game can only really be enjoyed by those who are looking for something very light and are not worried about any sort of long-term planning or strategizing.

For the aforementioned reasons, this game has been sold from my collection.

RATING: 9
Tired of trying to save the world, AGAIN? Then you need this game, and gleefully destroy it instead! 

For a game that is so easy to learn and teach, there is a surprising depth of strategy involved. While there are a lot of decisions to make each turn, they flow almost effortlessly, one into another until, almost disappointingly, the world is destroyed as we know it and a victor is crowned. 

My only complaint and why this isn't rated a 10 - the cards do not fit any sleeves out there. The designer should have started with a size that has sleeves in production already and built around that.

Kickstarter version, played multiple times, 5 player.

RATING: 7
I love the theme and this game does a solid job adapting the app to cardboard form. I think I can happily play this 3-5x a year, but there is not enough variety from game to game to have high replay ability. Every game you want to start off building your infectivity to spread across the board before switching to a balanced infect / lethality for the middle stretch and then finish with high lethality to close out the game.

I have played the bacterial version 3x and the viral once, but they didn’t feel very different as there were only two skills that changed (one being a passive).

The game is solid play;It is easy to learn and there are some tactical options as well with event cards.The component quality is also very good;

 but two things are missing in the game

A)You don't feel like world is fighting back a disease;Maybe an option like some 1st world countries killing disease tokens in from the most dominant player on that country would have been nice.A cure mechanic should have been somehow integrated into the game so we would have to target those "pioneering" countries to erredicate that.

B)Some countries are soooo generic in terms of hot/cold climate options it almost hurts my brain.For example Turkey has I think 4 slots.All of them are sunny.It should have been 2 generic slots(normal climate) one hot and one cold.All countries could have had such options making the game a bit deeper.Just because you are appealing for the masses shouldn't mean you should go no brainer on it.
Some countries should have as I told you some GDP or "fight back" things and some countries should automatically come to the board whether you like it or not.

Water and air connections could have been drawn like pandemic.Accessing "Whole" world from one port is a bit oversimplification as well.

Overall good game but could have been so much better.

Played the beta version of the game during its development. 
As a massive fan of the Plague App and strategic board games like Catan, I thought that the game brought all the fun and competitiveness of a great strategic board game, whilst still keeping true to the core values of the App game. 
Will definitly be buying it when it comes out and it will also be a few people's Christmas present

I got the game off Kickstarter, with the 5th player Expansion, and had some of the extra stuff that isn't typical to your usual play being a gold Box member, but I want to say that doesn't skew my review of this game in the slightest. The extra stuff I have actually works as well as the base, and outside of I believe one card a friend of mine pulled, we only used cards that were in the main box. It definitely took a bit to get comfortable with the rules, and how to strategize and infect, but it was worth it, and I can't wait to play again now that I have the companion app for my phone, which adds abiance, as well as gives rules for regular play, and single player, It also will keep you up to date with expansions that are coming out with the game. In the end, where it says 40-75 minutes, I feel that is more so if each player has read the rules thoroughly, a group of guys casually playing it while enjoying a drink took about 3 hours, but it wasn't a boring 3 hours at all. Expected less time with less players, and with players who have a firm grasp on the rules. Overall I would suggest this game to players.

I wasn't sure if this was actually going to turn into a good game or not. I was worried they would just ride the hype of the app to get sales. However, it was a lot of fun. It brought in a lot from the app game, but was still much more its own board game version. Great mechanisms of area control,, tech upgrade paths, using VP as currency... It all came together great. Hopefully people aren't put off by the fact that you are a disease trying to kill off as much of the world as possible.

Got this from Kickstarter. 
The components are top notch. Box is solid with nice art and finish. Internally, the pieces are nice and the rulebook is great and very well written. Not totally happy with the blue/purple choice for pieces, easy to mixup as a colour blind person - but that's only really an issue in a 5 player game.

The game is fairly well thought out and plays pretty well, with a fun theme. The mechanics of the game work pretty well and make a degree of sense. My only major gripe about the game is that it is very luck based. I started in Argentina, which only has a harbor. It took me 2 trait wipes to finally get a waterborne card so I could escape South America. I got lucky that other South American countries came out that other people couldn't spread to. The dice roll to kill countries introduces more luck. As I rolled to try and kill 3 countries in South America - I killed the only one (requiring me to roll 1 on a d6) that allowed me an escape from the continent. I was just lucky that that very turn - I had evolved into waterborne and finally escaped to another continent. 

With so much luck involved (starting somewhere with air/water escape, drawing the right traits, rolling to kill countries, drawing climate suitable countries on your continent and getting the better powered events) - I don't think it's possible to win the game just with good strategy. While all games have a bit of fortune involved, it's usually either card draw or dice rolls - with some chance to mitigate against misfortune. In this game, there's multiple paths to pain. And if you're unlucky - then you can just be very unlucky and have no chance to win.

So I have only one real thing to complain about - but it's a bit of a major one, I'm afraid. It takes the game from being a really solid strong game to being one that will only see periodic play/maybe even become trade bait.

RATING: 7
Thematically, the game is very well done.  The card names are good, the arc of a disease is well captured -- you want to be infectious sometimes and lethal other times, but not all the time.  I also like how nations rise and fall during the game as players vie for control.

Mechanically, the game is a very straight forward area majority plus some die rolls.  The luck is mitigated so it's not too bad, but there is still a lot beyond your control.  There is some reward for being second place, in that all players present at a nation's destruction get a special card.  But early in the game there is a big reward for being alone and turtling, and players who fight both lose.  Later in the game it isn't so bad.

Overall there is a lot of luck early (a bad lethality roll early can be a disaster, and starting in a small continent or one that doesn't come out early can leave you effectively locked out).  Once things get moving, the luck drops and players have plenty of opportunity to avoid disaster.

update:  despite all its problems, I find this game has tremendous thematic charm.  Even when you are down due to bad luck, there are still interesting choices and things you can do to have a shot at winning.  And I really like the tension about how high you want your lethality to be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid area control game. Easy to learn, logical rules, interesting decisions, fast gameplay. Best for 4+. Very nice and clean graphics is helping smooth flow of the game. 

My objection: inferior quality and cheap components (cards, player boards), gameboard itself is quite ok although small, tokens are ok. But this game deserves better treatment. Like it's big digital brother.

Anyway, I'm glad I have the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite a good light area control game.  The theme is very well integrated, and the event cards are pretty strong and incentivize spreading out across many countries to collect them.  Choosing how to evolve your plague is interesting, but there's not much variation. You have 4 binary attributes to add: being able to go in hot or cold countries (and strangely they are not exclusive - you can be both hot and cold resistant - it would be more interesting if you couldn't be both), and being able to move from airport or port countries (again, it would be more interesting if these were exclusive).  The other variables are infection rate (how many cubes you place on the board), which you want to increase quickly early on, and lethality (how easily you can kill a country), which is critical to get high at the end of the game to ensure you get full points for all your placed cubes.  I would have liked more variation in types of traits, giving you permanent special abilities or more complex interactions with city environments, but I understand they wanted to promote the amount of competition between players for spots.  When only 1 player gets heat resistance out, for example, they have free reign over many countries until another player can get heat resistance out.  I also would have liked if the trait cards were drafted more like Ticket to Ride, and you could discard some, draw some, rather than the all or nothing discard and draw 5.  There a lot of randomness from what you draw, with the possibility of none of the traits you draw giving you anything better than what you already have.  To reduce the randomness, I would suggest you have 4 face-up countries available, and perhaps you can spend 1 DNA to flush the face-up ones into the bottom of the deck, and that when you discard a country, you can discard any number of traits in your hand (not all) and draw back up to 5 from a set of 4 face-up trait cards and/or the trait deck.

Played with 5 and it took about 2 hours. I like the theme, playing as a virus was fun, and it had some decent strategic decisions to be made, but in the end, it came mostly down to luck. Way too much luck and take that for such a long game. The worst was when I managed to take control of India about 3/4 into the game, and rolled the die with only a 1 in 3 chance of getting the kill - I rolled a 1! Hooray! Success! But no... my opponent whips out a card that says my kill doesn't count, and I must take back one of my cubes. I didn't even know such a card existed. No one else had a kill negated. This single card cost me at least 15 points in a game that I lost by 12. I don't mind some some small take that cards in a long strategy game, but this one was devastating, on top of the already luck-driven game. It basically felt like Munchkin, in which I had been tricked into thinking my strategic decisions mattered.

Fairly generic area majority game that basically copies some of its action cards from old games like El Grande.

This is a great game! 
First - the components, the rulebook, the art, everything is great, well thought through and of high quality! 
The gameplay is simple, and the turn order is described on the player board. 
Turns are snappy which keeps the game interesting even when it's not your turn, and some things another player does directly affects you, often in a good way. ;) 
The theme is interesting and all the cards are thematicly grounded and some what whimsical, like playing a card named "infected board game", or "repetetive strain injury". 
Directly after playing our first game we wanted to play it again straight away, and that does not happen very often at our house because we often want to play multiple games at game night.

First Impressions:
Everything that follows is purely based on first impressions after opening the game box. At the time of writing, I have not yet played the game. This is also a review of the Collector's Edition version of the game. (Black Box, Gold Lettering. Includes 5th Player Expansion and Patient Zero Pack)

Upon opening the box and laying out the game pieces, one thing stands out, the playing cards.
At 2.75in x 2in (7cm x 5cm) they feel really, really small. This becomes more apparent when attempting to read the Country Cards. The flavor text (Population, Land Size and Finances[?]) is almost comically tiny. The City Names that label each Infection Marker placement (Black Hexagons) on the cards, are only slightly larger. While I and many others can read these with relative ease, persons attempting to play the game that suffer from sight related afflictions will either find it difficult or impossible to read the cards, outside of the actual country name. This seems to be an issue with all three card types (Country, Trait and Event). While the game related text is legible, all flavor text may be too small to read for some players.
Each player token set is separated into their own zip-close baggies. A nice addition to keep the pieces neat when in storage.
The Patient Zero cards are also stored separately within their own zip-close bag.
The cardboard divider included in the game box has one large section to hold the End Game Bonus card and the Player pieces and also has three smaller sections to hold the different card types. Please note, these sections are roughly 4.25in x 2.625in (10.16cm x 6.6675cm) in size, which comfortably fits larger cards from other board games, but not quite large enough to hold a standard Bicycle playing card.

The printing on the game board, cards, card mats and the game box is superb. While tiny, the text is crisp and all images are vibrant. 

There is no denying that this game is a high quality product, but the decision to use smaller than average playing cards is a puzzle for me. A review on gameplay to be added soon.

Wow this was such a fun game! Excellent design and i just love how all the mechanics work. Every phase that a players turn is so well designed and and fun. And the game is really thematic with the viruses that spread on the board either on an adjacent country or if you have evolved your virus to be for example airborn then you can let the virus spread to other continents. Very clever and thematic design. Love this :)

RATING: 5
Theme is pretty much tacked on, game is VERY dependent on luck (cards for traits, areas and events with no chance to increase your draws; D6 rolls for killing countries). "Sudden Death" can feel more like "slow and painfull death" if one player has the means to prolong the game artificially while noone else can do anything usefull anymore and is unlucky with killing the remaining countries.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is pretty solid. Here is why:
1) Components:
They are great. The cards feel nice. The board and player mats are all very nice quality. The plague tokens and death dice are really something special and they have chosen good colours.
2)Complexity:
This is a really nice game in that is has a low barrier to entry but a moderately high ceiling. Anyone can do well playing this game, but an experienced gamer will do better. Similar to ticket to ride the game is played 60% single player and 40% interactive with others. You can really just focus on your own game and the scoring happens all at the end. Their seem to be a couple strategies to winning which is nice, no one strategy wins all.
The single player variant is very well done and is quite hard.
3) Fun Factor:
This game is fun. The topic seems a bit intense, as indicated by Tom Vassal, but honestly no one I play with has even really thought too much about what the game is suggesting. Anyone can play this game. It feels mildly competitive but honestly plays like a 4 player single player game which I like. I play with many different people, many of which do not like getting their ass kicked by the person who owns the game time and time again. This game is a nice way to have a competitive game that ultimately still feels like you won or lost based on your own performance. No hard feelings. 

Final thoughts:
I would recommend this game. However, it doesn't call to me to pick it off the shelf as much as some of my others games. Worth the purchase at the price point for sure.

Reverse Pandemic thematically where players play different pathogenic bacteria spreading fear and disease across the globe. The goal is to wipe out cities, countries and eventually, the world.

This game is a simple worker placement game with placement restrictions coming from countries spread across continents. Bacteria has to evolve to spread through hot/cold climates and across oceans in order to kill populations. A unique twist comes from rolling the death dice to wipe out countries from the board. However, this means rolling dice and a fair bit of luck. Event cards also allow for random and unfettered player-player aggression. Overall, game is short, filled with direct conflict from worker placement and event cards which introduce a fair bit of chaos. Good for a few plays with newbies and also the occasional filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Play is similar to the mobile game. Definitely catches the frantic feel of the mobile app(and dark humor) and the event cards are fun and powerful in multiplayer. I'm also interested in trying without any event cards, especially for 2 player, as so far 2 player games have been very lopsided between my wife and myself(early leads and country kills equate to further bonuses thru event cards). That said, we've both enjoyed it very much, even when losing. Excited for new pathogen types in future expansions! It'd be fun to see who can win with Bacteria vs. Virus vs. Fungus vs. Parasite vs. Prion!
* Wondering if new "catch up" mechinism is warrented, instead of country killer drawing event cards, other players draw event cards instead(either other players with disease tokens in killed country or all other players). Will be testing on future playthru.

Very fun overall. Having only played 3 player, it does seems like the game should scale well with more or less players. I'm guessing 3-4 players may be the sweet spot, though. The rules are well written and clear, and the game is easy to learn. It's all simple, rules-wise, so that helps. 

It's an excellent port of the game to tabletop. Buying traits and constantly evolving your disease to your current needs seems to work well in this form, providing many decisions on how best to spend DNA points. Only, the winner is the player with the most DNA points, so they must spend wisely.

There is a fair amount of luck in the game, which I'm perfectly fine with, and it fits with the game. Traits acquired may shape strategies, but could keep players from needed Heat or Cold Resistance traits or Plane/Port traits. Multiple bad rolls of the Death die may get annoying for some players. 

The components are great for the price paid. The cards are thick and sturdy, the map looks nice, and the tokens all look and feel great. Seriously, the tokens steal the show here, especially the DNA point markers. The player boards are thick cardstock rather than cardboard, but they feel like they'll hold up for quite a while. Ndemic really did a wonderful job with the game, especially considering it's their first tabletop adventure.

Can also be played to a very competitive level, and is a good game if you're into strategy. I haven't played against the PlagueBot, so I can't speak for it, but I've only heard good things about it's balance. It can take a few turns to get used to the cycle of your turn, but once you know them, its all fast paced infecting and killing from there (err, fun and games).

Good fun, it's a bit like RISK but with an extra dimension of killing off cities and losing your disease base. It doesn't help when you opponent nukes South Korea, stealing your DNA points.

Buy it, before you get infected...

Besides the seemingly low cost to return to the game after eradication, this game is SUPER fun. It does have a little luck of the draw, some strategy and a lot of dice luck. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

Kickstarted! (Collector's Edition)

Easy to learn and plays quick once everyone understands the rules.  Play length for 5 players wasn't bad at all (played without the Event deck until everyone learned the game properly.)

I got this from my parents when I kept talking about it after playing the mobile game and I hardly ever get my family to play it because there is five of us but my brother is younger than me and wouldn't mind working as a team but if there is a fifth Plauge that would be awesome

Great board game!

I tested out a beta version of the game, and loved it. The board game strategy has some similarities to the mobile game where you want to try and infect as much as you can, then boost your lethality later to take out countries, just don't make the same mistake I did and wait to long to start killing countries, or other players will beat you to it!

I loved using the event cards just as much as I cursed the player who used them against me. They are easy to use and understand, but using them at the right time in the right combination can be a fun, interesting, and endless challenge for any strategist.

Highly recommend this board game for newbs and pros alike!

I wasn't expecting area control, but I can roll with it. The rules and gameplay are pretty tight and well-developed. There's nothing too new or innovative here, but it did its best to stay true to the app and I think it succeeded in what it wanted to do.

Great first effort from Ndemic games. Really good competitive play with area control mechanics.

Played this at my weekly gaming and everyone wants me to bring it back for another play.  Actually most wanted to play it again right away.  Wait time between turns at 4 player wasn't bad at all and the game was at its best when people were giving their bacteria stories based on where it was and what traits it had. With explaining the rules, 4 players, and setup the game was roughly 90min give or take.

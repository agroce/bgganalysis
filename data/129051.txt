It’s fun initially but ultimately may not have much staying power. It’s also a little dry and while the same criticism could possibly be levelled at its bigger brother, Le Havre, that game doesn’t quite feel that way and in any event is on a much grander scale

An interesting little distillation of [I]Le Havre[/I].  I really like the goods management aspect with the warehouses.  

There is no variability in setup, or in the order that the buildings come out each game, so repeated plays against the same opponent certainly have the ability to become samey, and there aren't really that many different strategies.  

Still this is probably good for a few dozen plays, and it is inexpensive, so I'm not going to ding it for the fact that I'll probably not play it 100s of times.

What a nice surprise!  A great, small Rosenberg game with simple and clever mechanics.  My only complaint is that the tiles (and subsequent print) is VERY small, but that goes hand-in-hand with the small box.  It also was hard to tell the red and brown apart on some tiles, but otherwise, a very good game.

A fantastic 2p game!  Very well done!  Eliminates all the fiddliness of Le Havre and boils the experience down to a manageable play time.  So cool!  I really wish the designer had used the cube-grid mechanic for the original Le Havre - it just works so well and is so much easier to follow and use than a thousand double-sided chits.  Even if you don't like Le Havre, you may like this one.  Play it!

RATING: 5
1st play: Le Havre but not. Some of the same agonizing decisions, the resource wheel which I'm starting to love and a spatial aspect to the resources. Long term the game needs an expansion. 

2nd play: I enjoyed the mechanics and there is some opportunity for clever gameplay here, but the game is fairly scripted.  The buildings just do variations of the same things, and there's not a lot to distinguish one from the next.  Very spreadsheety.

RATING: 7.5
A light medium Eurogame that is very exciting for both players.

The combo mechanics of clock and resource collection for victory point purchases, which in turn, accounts for more various ways of resource management, makes this game truly a challenge.

The only complain about this game is the small components. The values could hardly be seen at certain reflection light angle. Nothing too serious that hampers the game.

A medium length play time of under and hour.

I foresee the boredom setting in once you have played this more times. An expansion will be helpful to maintain a level of interest.

Has basically nothing to do with LE HAVRE. Not one similar mechanic. Only connection is the name and the art.
But its a very good 2-player-game on its own. Plays fast and has NO luck in it at all. It's all about player decisions.

+ Overview of the buildings on the sides of the inner box! Very good idea!

IF TRADING NOTE: Dent on bottom of box.
To be honest I picked this up because I couldn't find "all creatures..." (the two player Agricola spin off)  That said I enjoy this game.  I feel I might get tired of it after several more plays however, and I'm not sure an expansion with new buildings would even help that much.  All in all a great game, with less then great (but still some)replay value.

A quick version of Le Havre? No, there are not that many connections to the original game. There is not much replayability and I think something is missing too. I prefer other games when comes to the 30' clock or playing the full game of Le Havre for having a great time! In overall a nice game but I wouldn't recommend it.

Ez egy nagyon jó kis felkészülés az "igazi" Le Havre-ra: lehet szokni az ikonokat, de egyébként semmi köze a kettőnek egymáshoz. Én nagyon szívesen játszom ezzel, de (ritkán mondok ilyet) nagyon durván száraz játék. Gyakorlatilag végig csak váltogatunk, tologatjuk az egyébként ötletes táblázaton a nyersanyagokat, de semmi olyan érzésem nincs, hogy ez itt búza, vagy hal:)
A körszámlálás ötletes, és az egész jól működik, de mondom ez inkább csak imitálja a Le Havre-t. Jó kis könnyed játék. Bő fél óra...

Le Havre's smaller brother is quite different from the original: they share artwork and theme but work in a very dissimilar way.
The game is about building and utilize different kind of buildings, has a predetermined 12-turn duration and no luck at all!
The good news is that the game works very well, is quite fast and has zero setup time!
The bad news is that the game is a little dry (almost abstract), so you don't really feel to "manage" anything (and certainly no portual entreprise)...

I really like this quick two player game.  It's really strategic for how simple and short it is.  It's largest flaw is that the buildings do not change from game to game - so it is lacking in variety and replayability.  I still enjoy playing it with my wife now, so I can't complain too much.

After initially not liking this I finally got around to a second play, and now I like it quite a bit! When I first played it, I felt like the buildings had "no character", the resource tracker was an odd abstraction, it all felt a bit abstracted and dry to me. I wondered if it was more appreciated by folks who had played Le Havre, which I hadn't?

I also at the time was not a big fan of games where others can use "my" buildings! I've since got used to that in games like Lords of Waterdeep and actually I now like it because it adds depth to games and gives me something else to think about, which IS something I appreciate.

Perhaps it also helps that I have played more Rosenberg games since then, though not Le Havre yet, which we do own. Now I see a game with clever mechanisms giving me a lot of turns in a short time and even a bit of theme if you look for it. A game that picks out key parts of bigger resource management games and streamlines it.

That odd abstracted warehouse resource tracker is great. One cool thing is it makes it easy and fast for me to judge the value of buildings to my rival at any time. I can just glance it. I don't have to count up resources or even read a number. I can see where their fish or brick cube is and how it can move and what the available buildings can do for it. That's really clever. This Uwe guy should stick with games!

:D

That my rival can use my building is a cool tension thing. I may have to use my own buildings sonner than I would like, before its payout gets even better next turn, because my rival might jump in and use it and pinch the current benefit level.

There are not so many games I have played where it's so easy and quick to pay attention to your rival without downtime to have it influence your play.

So after two plays, I now feel it's a little gem! My only small worry right after this second play was, has it got a lot of replayability, with the same buildings coming out at the same time each game? Will it become scripted?

Time will tell but my guess is that it DOES have good replayability. I suspect it may be a little like chess. One slightly different action this turn may throw you down a different course.

I think there IS lots of less obvious variability in when you take a payout on a building, at 2x, 3x, or 4x. When you have a choice of which resource(s) to boost, which one you take. If you decide to overpay or not on a resource.

Neat game. I was wrong, though I did say, I need to give it a second shot to check, and I am glad I did. I just wish I had got around to it sooner! It's a keeper now and this means there is not a single Rosenberg game I have played that I don't like.

I rate Le Havre proper a 10.  This version -- complete crap.  The components are crap -- the spinner is crap, the buildings are too small, and board and counter for resources is dumb.

And the game is a joke.  I bet Uwe thought his little resource board was rad, but what it does is turn this totally into an abstract game about moving 4 colored cubes around a gridded board.  Which is fine, except it has nothing to do with Le Havre proper, and why waste all the effort try to theme it all when you could just go pull out a much better 2 player abstract game.

Bland and unmemorable. This is basically a spreadsheet program turned into a game. It's very, very repetitive and the nonvariable setup makes both the game beginning scripted and the game as a whole not very replayable.

A little bit too dry and mathy for my taste. There are plenty of strategy avenues to explore in this game though. My preferred gaming partner for 2p games (aka my wife) really doesn't like it, so it doesn't hit the table at all. One of the main reasons I'm trying to trade it away.

Stands up fairly well to repeat play - i.e. gets better with age.  Doesn't really feel like Le Havre but fits a good niche in the 30 minute game while waiting for another game table to finish.  

Cube pushing without any of the excitement of Le Havre (and not much less time) - would play 2p Le Havre before this

 	A very interesting game. I want to compare it to Le Havre, but I have yet to play that. Inland Port will probably not take over from All Creatures Great and Small as our go to 2 player game, but I still think it will get some good plays. The mechanics of the game are incredibly simple, but there is enough going on to make this a game I want to come back to. I am only worried that it can be somewhat solved. I was very happy with how close the ending score was, as this shows that there is a lot of balance there as well. My friend at work and I also had a lot of fun with messing over the other persons plans, by using the other person's building before they had a chance to benefit from it. I am interested to see if I come back to this more often.

RATING: 8
It is indeed a fun little game of resource conversion. It plays quickly, isn't all that hard to grasp. However, what it is missing for me is variability. I'm not saying it needs it, but for me I like the variability that comes from either a random assortment of options (like only these buildings are available this game out of all the potential buildings) or the buildings coming out in a random order (I like this less, but it at least makes games feel less scripted as you have to vary your plans based on the order of things). Also, the game is more abstract than I would like. I like transforming my fish into smoked fish. Or my grain into bread. Yes, we do that in this game, but you have to imagine that that is what the positions on the spreadsheet mean, because there is nothing in the representation that says it is so. Bread and Grain are represented in exactly the same way.

Mechanically more similar to Ora Et Labora but the building structure and flow does feel very Le Havre. It boils down the core gameplay of Le Havre into a blink or you'll miss span of 30 mins as buildings flash by your eyes.

The clever use of the Warehouse board to track your goods and the wheel to regulate and power your buildings is genius really.

I am a BIG fan of Uwe Rosenberg and almost all of his games. Agricola is my number 1 game and Le Havre is up there too. Therefore, I just had to buy this game. 

However, I must admit that it fell flat and was one of the bigger disappointments in January. I love dry eurogames, but this one is probably the driest I’ve ever played – the theme is paper thin and the player boards is literally what the Ameritrashers describe as the essence of eurogames: soulless, non-thematic dry cube-pushing! 

Now, if it took 30 minutes I would probably like it more, but it takes 1 hour to play and only 2 players can play, and I feel there are so many other much better 2 player games which can be played in the same amount of time.

Every turn you have an action to either buy a building, or use a building (yours or your opponents for a cost).  Overall, it's fairly simple to play, but it gets tricky with this board that manages how many resources you have and the count isn't as simple as +1/-1.  There is also a neat dial mechanism where the longer a building goes unused, the more powerful it becomes.  Good two player offering that I would play again.

Fun, unique elements that get old fast. I don't like how the tiles come out in the same order, what that amounts to for us is that we are faced with the same choices again and again and our strategies haven't evolved much over repeated plays. Also, the rules were poorly written at parts and left us scratching our heads trying to figure them out. I ended up implementing my own way of keeping track of how many turns had been taken later in the game when you have something like 5 turns...I don't think the game is well equipped to help with that.

I think that this is a really well designed game.  The mechanics and the physical game design lend towards efficient play and the ability to focus on the strategy. The pace of the game does keep a sense of tension and excitement even though you are just trading goods and moving little blocks around.  There's a good amount of player interaction which is fun and yet rather uncommon for a Euro.  I highly recommend this!

Interesting take on le havre mechanics in a small size box. The turn structure with the fixed availability of buildings feels a little rigid and has players competing for combo-pieces. On the other hand, this rewards blocking the opponents buildings at the right moment. Despite its reasonable size, the fiddlynes of the components keeps this one from being a good game to travel with.

The Inland Port is a very good 2 player game that brings enough of Le Havre to be worthy of the name.  It's a good gaming experience in a small box & it doesn't take all day to teach or play.  The only thing I wonder about is that sometimes you can look at someone's resources & figure out who will start the next round.  From there you can math out a course of action.  Adding a little hidden information might be a cool way to make the player turns a little less predictable in certain instances.  But that is my only complaint.  Fun game.  Try it.

The most interesting aspect of the game is the "use 'em or lose 'em" feature of the buildings.

The game is at least a half hour quicker than two player Le Havre. I'm not sure yet which game I like better. The absence of random elements eventually may somewhat script the play in Inland Port, but there are so many actions over the course of a game that replayability should be maintained.

A very solid, well thought out game.  Good mechanics, like the scoring track.  But as a little 2-player game, it just doesn't hit the table very much.  Other medium-weight 2-pl games beat it out.  The rotating wheel idea is great (I've never played Le Havre itself).  It's a good game but as these games go, there are others that fill the same urge.  Not bad at all though..

Players are businessmen in Le Havre, trying to get rich.  Players on their turn take an action - either build a building, or use a previously built building.  Buildings built or used go onto the zero space of the Ora et Le Havre wheel, where if you're patient, you get to use a building many times.  However, another player may swoop in and use your building for you, for the cost of a measly Franc.  Buildings typically manipulate goods in your warehouse, cleverly depicted on a grid, and offers a nice, pleasant puzzle to consider as you try to maximize building use and warehouse storage.  At the end of twelve turns, most money from building value and francs in hand wins. 

I really enjoyed this one - just like Agricola: All Creatures, a ton of fat has been cut off the parent game, leaving a pleasant, 30 minute two player puzzler.  Great stuff.

It's not bad, but it's far from good.  The basic idea is that each player can buy buildings, then use the actions on those buildings.  What you get from the action is dependent on where the building is in the day/night cycle.  (I may have said that wrong, but I digress).  Anyway, the problem is as follows: as you progress, buildings can cost wood, clay, fish, or wheat.  Some may cost wood and clay while others fish and wheat.  None of them mix resources beyond that.  The point is this... one player will obviously elect to build up there resources towards wood and clay, the other will opt for fish and wheat.  The strategy for every game becomes the same.

Inland Port is a resource management game, with a brilliant 'warehouse' mechanic. Players alternate erecting or activating buildings (spending or acquiring resources), and track their goods in their warehouses. Moving up the warehouse resembles acquiring 3 resources, and a shift to the right resembles 1, but players must keep their goods within the confines of their warehouse, which is where the magic is born. Going high in the warehouse increases one's maximum spend, but reduces liquidity, which is important since change is not awarded for over-payment of a building. This puzzle of resource balance is incredibly fun, until players become familiar with the order of the building deck. Each game will see an unbearably similar release of buildings, which undercuts the game entirely. The game quickly devolves into scripted patterns robing it of its youthful brilliance. Inland Port is yet another Rosenberg 2p-adaptation that is infuriatingly lacking in replayability.

Undoubtedly a good game, but a failed experiment for me.

-------------Original rating 07/12/15 Score:6
[b]Rating based on - 20+ plays, 2 player[/b]
The only Uwe Rosenberg I have owned/played is At the Gates of Loyang. On a constant quest for good 2 player games I picked this one up on a whim even though the theme did not appeal to me. It had a lot of things that DID appeal to me - 2 player only, short play time, designer of a game we love, and lovely cutesy artwork. I now affectionately refer to this one as 'Spreadsheet: The Board Game'. It is a game where you manage a warehouse of goods so you can buy buildings, use them to improve your building production, and convert those buildings and goods into victory points for the end of the game. I just do not get the game. Being the majority game winner in the house, winning this game eludes me. I've won 1 out of all the games we've played and while the winning of a game does not interest me as much as having fun playing the game, it would be good to know how to get better at the game. I can't say it's that fun to play either. I don't feel like I am actually USING buildings rather than collecting them and pushing cubes/chits up and down a spreadsheet type scenario. As a lover of abstracts, I feel this game is abstract, but maybe a bit TOO abstract? The coolest thing about this game is the wheel which is unique to us. I'd like to see how that wheel works in other games. I might try Glass Road or Ora et Labora in the future. Luckily the quick playtime (20-30 mins for us) means that it doesn't drag on and get too boring otherwise it would be rated a 5.

What's weird is that while *I* don't get the game, my other half who does all the winning, also feels he doesn't get the game either. We can only describe our feelings about it as [b]apathetic[/b].

A great scaled-down 45-minute 2-player version of Le Havre, with 30 buildings.  The design is very elegant, with the resource wheel from Ora et Labora playing a prominent role - but to determine how powerful the buildings are - not to provide resources.  It feels like a puzzle, with more constrained choices than the original Le Havre game, but it still carries the flavor of the original.

Quite a few of the more recent Rosenberg games have much reduced play-to-play variability. I'm not sure why that would be desirable (but I'm sure it's much easier to playtest...). In a condensed game like this, this missing variability is much more apparent than, say, in Ora et Labora. In effect, this means that after a couple of plays discovering the game, all that is left to do as a player is improve your score by tiny amounts. There is no other approach to try, no radically different path to follow, no unforeseen events to adapt to, no attempt at arousing curiosity, and thus, no longevity.

Le Havre:tIP was a better experience than I was expecting. I had heard it felt like an ugly, castrated version of Le Havre. Really, it just gives you simple buildings to work with, an interesting spreadsheet to manage resources, and a rotating wheel that elegantly keeps track of several different functions in the game. The spread of buildings on the wheel is a bit too cluttered for my likes, and this game has a rather high multiplayer solitaire feel. Those points aside, it's a very decent two player game! If you have the time, play LE Havre; if you have only an hour or so, I'd play this instead!

The best 2-player game I have played so far. While it doesn't really have anything to do with full Le Havre other than the name and some of the buildings, it's still an enjoyable experience that plays quickly and is still thinky despite the simplicity. The only issue I have with the game at this time is that I find that the exact same setup in every game can make memorization a factor were a player to identify and be able to build/use/sell the "best" buildings in multiple games. Thankfully, I haven't come anywhere near that point yet, so the game is still great fun for me.

So much for the pros.
Now the cons :
I have lost all but one of my 9 games of Le Havre. I just do not understand what a winning strategy could be and I always end up falling short. The problem with this game, I guess, is that the winner does not know either what they did that led to victory. 
Annoying for a developement/optimization game.
Will most probably not play again.

After playing Agricola: All Creatures, this was a letdown. Worried about how many plays this has in it. 1) The buildings will be the same every game. 2) They don't have that much variety anyway.

However, I do think there are some strategies to explore as you become more familiar with the buildings and the order in which they enter the game. Amazingly, this is very similar to the feel given by the building cards in the game's older brother. Props to Uwe managing to capture the feel of that marvelous game in this simple, 2p rendition.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable two-player game which requires thoughtful strategy, tense decision-making, and a close awareness of your opponent (who can ruin your carefully laid plans by using your buildings just when you need them)! The puzzly nature of the resource management is also a highlight, and it plays very quickly once you get into the swing of it.

For Rosenberg fans looking for a solid two player experience, this is deeper than Patchwork, and quicker / more streamlined than Fields of Arle. But, for me at least, the best Rosenberg two player experience is offered by "At the Gates of Loyang".

RATING: 7
Fun game with a novel way to manage your resource levels. The building rondel is a bit odd. I think Le Havre is better and it kind of plays fine with 2, so I'm not sure what need this game fills, but it's enjoyable still.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An abstract resource optimisation game with no significant theme whatsoever. Completely devoid of any luck or hidden information, playing it feels a bit dry and unexciting. The flow of the game, however, is quite good, and deciding when to use your buildings before your opponent does makes for a good part of the game's charme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanically, this is quite good. It does have an odd production that makes playing the game a little awkward. For instance the oddly shaped buildings that don't fit all that well on the player boards. Reading opponent buildings at a glance can be tricky. The board for item storage is undeniably clever, and central to the game, but is not simple to use.

The usability issues are kind of quibbles though, because the game is good solid fun, and a finely honed-down version of Rosenberg's many recent designs. I wish more of his games were so streamlined.

This has little to do with Le Havre, which is fine by me!

Light version of Le Havre for 2 players and particularly useful for travels and casual moments. I am not playing this game if I am at home and have anything a bit more complicated than this.
As I have not played Le Havre I am not going to compare both games. I would say that I had the game for a couple of years and only played it when I didn't have anything else to do. The game is ok, you can have some fun.
I think that I am not very objective with this type of short 2-players game, that is because I am not a big fan of 2-players game, what I look for in a face to face game, is to have some complexity and a lot of strategy, like War of the Ring or Star Wars Rebellion.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2015)

I love Le Havre and I’m a fan of Mr. Rosenberg, so I had to buy this game. At first I was a bit disappointed because the beginning is so slow, however the game begins to pick up momentum very quickly and then you have many options with few actions to execute, I love this.

I feel the game isn’t obvious, you have many interesting decisions (which building should I build? Which building should I use? If I don’t use this building it will be sold) with very simple mechanisms (you have only two options each turn). The variety is generated from the buildings.

The playtime is relative short.

The components and art are great. The player boards are very neat as is the warehouse and the arrows that show you quickly how to pay. I dislike that the player boards get crowded very quickly making it hard to see which buildings are available.

Another minor quibble, Le Havre: The Inland port is nothing like Le Havre. They only share the goal, name and art, other than that they are very different games (which is not a bad thing) but I was somewhat disappointed by this. I was expecting a very similar game. I think this can be similar to Ora et Labora but (sadly) I haven’t played that game yet.

Bottom line, I’m enjoying my plays of Le Havre: The Inland Port. For now, the game is a keeper in my game collection and I want to play it again soon.

I wish that the game was related more to its parent than by just artwork and names of buildings, since my main beef with Le Havre is its play time. This game certainly plays much more quickly, but it is definitely much drier and mathematical. I would avoid playing this at all costs with an analytical/AP type player. It's definitely a game of maximizing your use of the different resources. I played the way I usually play Le Havre - hoarding resources for some future payoff. The payoff never came and I ended up wishing I had spent my resources more wisely and more often.

I really enjoy the incorporation of the wheel from Ora & Labora, it works very well here.

Es como un híbrido light de Le Havre y Ora et Labora, con cero azar y muy estratégico, pero también con ciertos handicaps: el sistema de sumarse recursos es raro, el tema está pegadísimo, y es bastante abstracto.

The epitome of cube-pusher, engine- and tableau-building Euros. Quite a good experience for a small-box two-player game, but however clever the 'cube-pusher' part is, it does not make sense thematically at all.
Also, replayability seems to be low and I can't see expansions published.

Decently deep and pleasingly fast 2 player with serious replayability issues.  Anchor buildings are central to final score, you need to set yourself up for coming turn, failing to capitalize on going 1st is probably going to cost you the game.  The big interest is that it's both hardcore and fast.

Uwe Rosenberg's bigger games like [thing=31260][/thing], [thing=35677][/thing], and even [thing=39683][/thing] are among our favorite games.  When we heard that he had started working on two player versions of some of these games, we were intrigued.  On the one hand, this seemed like it should be right up our alley.  On the other hand, we already enjoy playing these games with two players, so what more could they offer?

It was for this reason that we initially passed on [thing=119890][/thing]---we already enjoy [thing=31260][/thing] as a two player game and from the reviews, the smaller version didn't seem to offer anything particularly new in comparison that we couldn't get already.  However, [thing=129051][/thing] seemed to only be related to its big brother in theme only, containing some new mechanisms.  I ended up getting this for my wife's birthday to try out.

It's a solid resource management game.  There are four resources (wood, clay, fish, and grain) that you manipulate using various buildings, similar to [thing=35677][/thing].  One catch is that the buildings are now placed on a time tracker, using a wheel similar to [thing=70149][/thing] (although we haven't played that game).  There's some nice interaction in that you can use your opponent's buildings and the resource manipulation within the constraints of your warehouse board is interesting.

However, the lack of randomness in the game is a little off-putting.  You start with the same resources and all of the buildings come out in the same order.  After several plays, we've already seen ourselves settling into a routine building vs. food strategy.  A little randomness would go a long way for replayability (here's hoping for an expansion!)  Most of the buildings also give somewhat similar effects, so having more buildings with more unique abilities would be great.  The other fault with the game are the components---we just didn't like the component design of the game.  The buildings are small little chits which are difficult to read from afar---cards would have been much nicer.  Nicer resource components would have been great, especially since it's only 8 cubes right now.  The wheel is a nice design, but it can be hard to track which round the game is in and, especially at the end of the game, you have so many buildings that they don't fit.  This game could use a nice overhaul.

One thing this game achieves is being a relatively short resource management game.  It's definitely distinct from its big brother, but while we would rather play [thing=35677][/thing], [thing=129051][/thing] makes for a unique experience.

A relatively simple two player game that captures the feel of Le Havre.  It uses a clever wheel to help keep track of resources.  You acquire buildings that get more valuable over time.  You can use other players buildings by spending a coin.  If pressed, I like All Creatures Big and Small better but that is because I like Agricola better.

short-time "strategy" for two

fiddly, obvious choices, repetitive gameplay...

Better play Le Havre or Ora E.L. instead! Both are really great games for two advanced players that can be played fast although offering a broad spectrum of relevant decisions & strategies. They won't ever get as predictable as this one which imho is doomed to be boring after a couple of plays.

Jeder Spieler besitzt einen eigenen Spielplan mit Aktionsrad. Dieses wird jede Runde weitergedreht und regelt mehrere Dinge gleichzeitig: Wie oft die Funktionen der errichteten Gebäude pro Aktion genutzt werden dürfen (Es dürfen auch die Plättchen des Mitspielers benutzt werden!), wie viele Aktionen zur Verfügung stehen und wann welche neuen Gebäude ins Spiel kommen.
Eine Aktion kann aber auch der Erwerb eines neuen Gebäudes sein, das je nach Typ mit Geld oder Rohstoffen bezahlt werden muss. Ansonsten konzentrieren sich die Funktionen auf das Vermehren der Rohstoffe sowie deren Verkauf. Sobald beide Zeiger eine volle Umdrehung abgeschlossen haben (und somit alle möglichen Stufen genau ein Mal erreicht wurden), gewinnt der reichste Spieler (Bargeld plus Gebäudewerte).

A címével ellentétben nem sok köze van a Le Havre-hoz. Kétszemélyes játék, nekem az android app változata van meg, ami egyébként hibátlan kivitelezésre, hangulatra és játszhatóságra is.

A játék tipikus erőforrás-menedzsmentes, minél több pénzt összeharácsolós, kevés interakcióval. Ami viszont a pluszt hozzáadja:
- absztrakt adminisztrációja az erőforrásainknak (kiváló a kivitelezése a raktárnak az applikációban is),
- minden játékos használhatja a másik épületeit is, csak fizetnie kell érte,
- épületek akciója függ attól, hogy mióta nem használtuk,
- körönként növekvő akciók száma.

Elvileg nullához közeli szerencsefaktor, ötletes megoldásokkal, 30-40 perces játékidővel (appban kb. negyed óra alatt lepörög). Nekem bejött.

Seems quite good. I listed this for my hardcore 10x10 challenge before my first play, but fortunately I don't have to worry - this is good. I'm rather fond of this, especially as experience has taken the game length down from 50 minutes to about 30 minutes.

There may be some replayability issues in the long run, but meanwhile I think this is well worth the money.

So much decisions to be made in such a innocent-looking small game. It' not a filler, if played serously could take an hour or so because you need to constantly evaluate the available building and stop your opponent fron utilizing their buildings. 

If you do not mind its dryness and love min-max game in general, this is one of the simplest, but deepest 2-player game that can be finished in a reasonable time frame.

I have short shrift for games that heavily favour those who have 'learned the ladder', but with 2P that's quite a different proposition, as you invariably explore the game together. Smart rondel system which exploits both Ora & Labora and Farmerama (who ever thought they'd hear themselves say THAT?) and absolutely no leadership problems - if you can ever tell who is winning a game at a given point then you're a better man than I. Zero luck, although it sure doesn't feel like it.

A poor interface means it's not the greatest game to play while sitting face-to-face. Good for couples playing together side by side; not so good for big burly men.

Not a 'watered down' Le Havre at all. Instead, it's a fast, portable game in it's own right. I've only played once, and I suspect the game won't have a huge shelf life once players discover the combos, but the journey up to that point is destined to be enjoyable.

[b]Le Havre: The Inland Port[/b] was traded away with Dixit Origins and Splendor for Blue Moon City 10/31/14. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Initially my kids and I really enjoyed this game, but the lack of any variability to the set up killed it for me. There are different pathes you can take, but each game you define your approach and then execute it without much variance or opposition.

I ended up trading it because we have so many other Uwe games that are awesome with 2 and play fast (Agricola, Agricola All Creatures, Glass Road, Loyang and Patchwork spring to mind).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A really thinky game that plays in about a 1/2 hour.
- Mechanics: I love figuring out how to use the building in order to maximize the amount of each good I have in my warehouse.
- Building variety: There are 30 buildings in the game and you can't maximize each resource so you have to figure out what your scoring focus is going to be. Of course your opponent can then take a building you really wanted, but you can pay them to use that building. 
- I love using the player board/wheel to keep track of how many times you can use buildings (you can see how he further developed this idea for the resource wheels in Glass Road).[/i]

I enjoyed this game both times I played it, but it did not grab either of my opponents.  It simply wasn't going to get played much; my wife would hate it, and it's too abstract for my kids, the people who constitute my other possible opponents.  At best, I might have talked a kid into it in three or four years once they got older, but even then, I doubt they'd have gone for it.

I have too many other good games on the shelf as it is, so this one doesn't quite make the cut.

This game is mechanically much less similar to Le Havre than All Creatures Big and Small is to Agricola--it uses the Ora et Labora wheel to determine the number of times you can use a building, and has an interesting warehouse mechanic that I haven't seen anywhere else (it actually reminded me a little of the 18XX share price chart).  The buildings generally let you move your supply of a given resource up and over on the warehouse track (which represents more of that resource), sometimes at the cost of other resources.  Unused buildings become more powerful, but your opponent can use your buildings for a small cost, so you can't just wait for your stuff to be super-valuable.  Like All Creatures, this game is completely deterministic, which may affect replayability.

Not as fast as the box claims (unless you can make every move in 20 seconds), but still pretty fast. It all feels a bit mechanical, though, and, it's bizarre to say, almost too balanced. Scores are always close and I'm not sure there's much to be gained from lots of plays.

It's certainly quite different than the proper Le Havre board game -- this is much quicker, but the game play with quite different, even if it maintains the same spirit. My main issue with the game is that it seems likely to get samey after repeated plays, especially between the same players. Not bad, otherwise.

Wasn't able to tell who was leading at any point in time. Also, for an optimisation/efficiency puzzle like this, it was impossible to tell the relative value of each action! And the only way to win is to build more buildings/earn more money/go for special buildings.

Mar 2016: Part of Althea's 25th Anniversary Package. We are moving into 2-player games alot. I suspect we'll enjoy this one as much as its big brother.

July 2016: This feels like LH. My rating hesitation is its insufficient building list. This will wear out if played 3-4 times in a month. Good for 6 plays /year but I suspect it might be on 2017 10x10 for Althea.

Le Havre The Inland Port is a more simple and very streamlined version of Le Havre for 2-players only. It's quick and a no-luck, perfect information game.

It's... OK. We played Patchwork first and while it may seem much simpler than Le Havre, it has many of the same decisions without all the fiddly bookkeeping. We'll play Le Havre a few more times before deciding for sure but so far we can't see ourselves ever playing this if Patchwork is available.

Originally, I was quite disappointed by this game but further plays brought some enjoyment and I'm sure even more familiarity with the buildings will help.

I'm very skeptical it can be played in 30 mins however, 45-60 seems a lot more likely unless you are not paying attention to what your opponent is doing!

At first I thought: But why? Why not just play the fantastic original game as a two player? Yeah, I suppose there are some reasons - cost, portability, easier to learn - just not any I'm interested in. So, it's not for me then.

After playing I have to say that I'm still grappling with the why? In its own right it's a clever little two player game that flies by quickly, but without much social interaction. It's a thinking game. You've no idea who's in the lead until you add up the scores, not that knowing the current score would change the way you play. It doesn't help make it an exciting game though. There's no feeling of needing to catch up or protect your lead. The only real excitement is the concern that the other player is going to use one of your buildings you've had your eye on. With a lot of buildings to choose from and no real concern that any will hit the auto sell sector the game just fails the exciting test.

Functional and clever rondal and good storage mechanisms aren't enough to bring this out over its big brother - Le Havre - and just play that two player. On the plays side the game duration is a bit shorter, setup is a lot quicker and the box is a more portable size. If I didn't own Le Havre then this would be a keeper for my two player collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After just my first play, I can easily recognize that this is a good 2-player game. I really enjoy no-luck, dry Euros: you know what is coming out and when, the rounds have a predetermined number of turns, and resource production is up to the players and not dice. The way the boards are designed makes it easy to know who goes first for the round, how many turns are left, and how much each building can be used that round. Also, the resource warehouse board is quite unique; you have to be careful about where you are storing the four different materials to be the most efficient.

So again, on paper, it seems to check all the boxes for me: resource control, efficiency, engine building, etc. But why didn't I like it more? Well, for one, it was only the first time I played it, so I would need to play it more. But it was almost *shutter* TOO dry. I didn't have any meeples or characters to control, so it seemed too abstract from that perspective. As interesting as the resource board might be to manage, it looks horrible with just boxes, making it look kind of like a spreadsheet.

But it plays quick. And seems to really be open-ended. So I look forward to playing it more.

Definitely a mash up of Le Havre and Ora et Labora.  Unfortunately, it lacks the charm of either and pales in comparison.  The only interesting part of the game is managing you warehouse.  It takes a little bit to wrap your head around what it all means, but once you do, this really is the whole game.  I can't imagine this actually scratching someone's itch for the other two games.  Not a bad game, just not all that good either.  [12/09/2012]

I'm sure that with lots and lots of plays, it will overstay its welcome, as it the game is quick and the setup is fixed. However, it's a great, compact Le Havre-esque game packed into a short playtime. I love how the board nicely represents the flipping of the resources of the original with a sweet tabular layout. You still have the interaction between the two players by using the other player's buildings, and you still are working on a resource engine, even if it's much more focused on constructing buildings in this one. An excellent addition to my collection.

[Zman 12 edition] {France; action-drafting; 2p} The Inland Port is a nice 2p game.  It adopts of the theme of Le Havre, but not the mechanic.  The pointer wheel is quite nice - it creates tension between players.  I have to think when should I use the action of a building before it's too late.  So it’s quite challenging with a good opponent.  I enjoyed the game.

Players have to use building actions smartly to generate loads of resources and convert them in to money.  The luck of this game is low.  The progress of the game depends much on the interaction between players.

I can't say about the replayability because I haven't tried this enough.  Some users in BGG are concerned about the fix appearance of building may reduce variability.  So far, I feel this game is quite replayable.

The theme is non-existent :) I can't even imagine what's the purpose of a building.  I just know I have to calculate how to optimise my resources and thus Franc ...  And, there is NO illustration on the buildings!!!!!

Nevertheless, this game is more fun than I expected already.

The production quality is ok.  The pointers are functional, but too loose.  The buildings are too smart for my taste.  It looks a little stupid to offer 3 kinds of resources tracking markers.  The player aid is useless, too ( I don't really care about the cost of a building ).

Nice variant. Rules are simpler than in the ordinary Le Havre. The element of chance has been removed and there are no random effects (apart from selecting starting player).

But as a two player version it is okay.

Well, that happened. 36 or so actions later (each) and we've both generated 200 or so points, with one person having ten or so more for the win.

There's a little bit of push your luck, in how long you can leave your buildings before using them at the risk of your opponent using them, but even still you gain a VP.

I'm really not sure there's any scope to get better at this game. Stuff happens and then we count points.

Another decent two-player-only offering from Uwe Rosenberg that trades the depth of its predecessors (in this case, Le Havre and Ora et Labora) for streamlined, faster play. Given that players have only two choices on their turn (buy a building or use a building), Le Havre: The Inland Port barrels ahead pretty quickly (the advertised 30-minute timeframe seems right on target) but still offers enough depth to keep even hardcore gamers involved and interested. A definite winner.

And euro it is.. Bland theme and excellent mechanisms. Tough choices and room for both strategy and tactics. The good thing is that it also ends fairly quickly so the experience is rich and rewarding.

I liked it, but the major problem is you need an equally skilled opponent to enjoy this as neither luck nor player chaos is going to save him. The bland theme also works against this game.

There isn't a bad game here.  But it suffers from the fact that I know and like Le Havre and Ora et Labora, both of which are better games than this.  This is the bastard child of those two games, and it's a little bit of an awkward hybrid.  The natural comparison here is to look at Agricola:All Creatures Big and Small, which streamlined Agricola and focused the play on one particular aspect of the game and did it very well.  LHIP seems to be a little clunky and brings in the resource wheel from Ora et Labora.  While I like the wheel and how it acumulates resources, I find that it's more confusing than helpful in tracking rounds and start players.  Overall the game feels a little too abstract with the resource wheel and odd resource tracking board.  I felt like I was working an abacus to be honest.  There are also real concerns about playability since there is no randomness in the buildings or when they come out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Wondering whether this would be really painful to play solo. Too easy to see into the immediate future's moves and countermoves.

...DIYed this. Answer to my doubt: No, I don't find it painful to play solo. Reason: Unlike chess, I never really feel like a move was a big screw-up in "LH:TIP." This is a really incremental efficiency game most reminiscent (to me) of Caylus Magna Carta or something along those lines.

The "micro moves" nature plus the ability to use your opponent's buildings for a mere franc really saps tension and interest for me. So many possible moves plus lack of negative feedback from the game kind of gives it the opaque feel of a point salad game.

That said, I admire the design. The "spinner" method of tracking the increasing yield of buildings is really elegant. And the minor spatial aspect of the warehouse isn't complicated enough to make me disinterested, in contrast to the farm boards of the Agricola: ACBAS game.

There is no randomness, and as I also did with "All Creatures" I've added some, here by randomizing the buildings. This can create a couple of early turns where not all moves can be used, but I don't think it has much risk of being broken (due to the ability to use the other's buildings), and it is more interesting to me because the game, as a puzzle to be solved, at least changes every time.

My 6.5 rating is assuming you randomize the buildings. Prior to that I was going to rate it a 6.0.

Oy vey, Uwe. So much game in 30 minutes. Creates the same resource/building anguish of its progenitor, while also feeling completely different. I've never had so much fun pushing cubes up and down a warehouse.

Very dry game -- don't get it if you are looking for theme.

But, I love this game.  The game has been streamlined in such a great way that it feels like you play a 2 hour game in just 30 minutes.  The decisions are tough and meaningful, and yet with a little practice, you get really good at deciding what you want to do.  It's a ton of fun.

A spreadsheet game... literally. Players record their resources on personal spreadsheets.

Has none of the charm of it's bigger parent, Le Havre. Or its sister game Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, with its buildings and animeeples.

Significantly outclassed by Glass Road, which also plays in thirty minutes and has a wheel/dial.

There is no reason to own this game, in my opinion. Given away free.

RATING: 6
This is meatier than I expected. I think it represents everything that makes up the full Le Havre game experience, although it does it in a way that is completely different from the original game. That's a good thing, because it doesn't really overlap the original in a way that makes me need to choose between them. I do worry about its re-playablity factor, since the building arrivals are scripted but it might be that the order they are purchased in can take the game to new and varied places. Time and more plays will tell, but for now I think it is very good entry into the two player realm.

(I also give some serious bonus points for the creativity present in this design. The warehouse spreadsheet combined with the resource arrows on the buildings are absolutely ingenious.)

RATING: 7.6
Fast 2-player game with the combined mechanics of Le Havre and Ora et Labora.  Use the buildings to gain their benefits, then move them to the back of the line with the rondel sweep until they're available again.  All accomplished in a quick 30 minutes or so.  Plenty of strategy on which buildings to use (yours or theirs) and not a whole lot of luck involved.  As an aside note, this is the 3000th game I've added to my collection, so somewhat of a milestone addition I need to remember.

RATING: 6
This is a lot more like Ora & Labora than like Le Havre.
But it's very good, and its own game (whereas the 2-player Agricola feels more like a dumbed-down version of Agricola).

RATING: N/A
Two player warehousing and storage management on player inventory grids (almost abacussy). Economic strategy and combos. This is NOT 2-player LeHavre. Combines elements of LeHavre, Caverna, Ora et Labora steal use of other player buildings. Opportunities for screw-your-neighbor. Rondel activation system for your building and number of actions. Fast play.

Two games so far: brain burny number crunching and yet quite breezy in that the mechanics are very simple. One issue is that once the count up is done at the end it's not easy to say why one came out above the other. I guess at its core it's a tempo game: eking out one extra building from your set number of turns is probably going to win you the game. Need to play more to establish what the strategies are or if it is purely just maximising opportunities in the short term. Good thing is for now I am very interested to play more.
17/04/'17: Another play, was a close game where I went for lots of buildings and my opponent went for bigger value buildings. It was tight, just 1 point in it. I'm a long way from playing optimally, so for now this remains an interesting puzzle.

Not our kind of game, and the theme doesn't help. The writings on the small buildings are difficult to read, and the players' wheels become too crowded after a while.
Good if you like pure German games, luck is totally absent.

After reading the rules, I was a bit disappointed in the game. I guess I expected to much a kind of Le Havre LE (Light Edition). Also the gaming material inside the box was  minimal. I know the amount of material doesn’t say anything about gameplay, but somehow I expected to find more inside. The rules are easy. On a player’s turn, a player can do one of two actions.

    Buy a building
    Use a building

The game takes 12 rounds to play. Each round is divided into a different amount of turns. The starting player gets one turn more then the second player each round (the starting player changes every round). When a round starts, the starting player lays open the buildings that are marked on the back for that round. When he wants to buy it, he pays the amount that is stated on the top of the building-tile (money or food), and places the building on his wheel at the zero indicated region. When all players played their round the wheel turns 1 step forward.

If a player wants to use a building, it has to be inside the regions marked with 2, 3, 4 or 4 and a coin. He can use the action on the building the number of times in which region it’s placed. After using the building the building moves back to the region indicated with a zero. Also he can use a building of the other player. He then has to pay 1 money to the other player, and uses the building the number of times in which region it is in. Then it also moves to the zero indicated region (at the other players wheel). After twelve rounds the player with the most points (= money) wins the game.

As described above, it is a very simple game. Besides the name of the game and the buildings (which have the same names as in its Big Brother), it has nothing to do with it. Set Le Havre out of your mind, and just start playing. What unfolds is a very nice game with lots of interaction between the players. This is due to the fact, that players can use each others buildings. What seemed to be a bit of a disappointment after reading the rules proved to be a big windfall.

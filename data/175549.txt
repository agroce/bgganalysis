It's a great spin on the werewolf like games out there. I feel like there's maybe an imbalance in that there's not enough information to go on to find the witch(es) from one play-through to the next.

That being said, I still really love the game and the social atmosphere it creates.

A witch!!! The best social deduction game ever! Beats Avalon and Werewolf in my opinion. Best to play with candles and climatic music with players getting into the role of their characters. It is just so much fun to throw accusations at someone shouting: "you are the witch!".. because everyone is a witch!! He looked at me funny, she accused someone without reason, he is too quiet, she draws too many cards - everything is suspicious and proves that he/she is a witch!!
The mechanics itself is really good as well. The conspiracy phase when witches can multiply, the trials cards and confession after the night - everything works and it works really well. 15 plays in a row and it doesn't get boring. A must have!

RATING: 10
My favorite social deduction game right now.  

The cards remove the venom of lying and attacking that comes with Mafia/Werewolf, but there still is deception and deduction.  

There is an excellent balance in the game.  The stress of hunting witches while helping people and protecting yourself is awesome.  I love, love it when someone goes from bad to good.  I also love it when the crowd (good or bad)  reaches a tipping point and starts bagging on the minority player(s) until they snowball out. 

There often comes a time in the game when most players have an idea of who is bad and who is good, but the cards still can provide a way out for the party that is in trouble.  Other times, some players are totally confused near the end and it's hilarious to watch them get worked.   

Notes:

The Kickstarter version rule book needs some massaging.  I had to do some research online to sort out some questions.  Just needs to be a little tighter on explaining things.

The version of placing all the cards into the middle and then drawing--no good.  It's hard enough to track the witches that there's no idea to completely randomize it.  The witches have always won when we randomized it.  Sounds more fun than it is.  

During the "night" phase, we have everyone tap the table with their hands to create noise AND have the witch(es) move all of the little tokens.  Without the noise you can hear witches moving and that stinks.  People also watched where their token was before they closed their eyes.

Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.

The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. "Salem" takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.

Played a few times in a one session. I found that there's not much actual 'game' in this, rather it seems to be random accusations and convincing other people to go along with you. Otherwise you're defending yourself from said accusations. I would have liked more in the way of logical deduction elements based on people's motives/actions, but we couldn't really find this here. I will likely play it again and hopefully something more positive comes out of it, or perhaps we'll find something we missed.

Not a party game fan, but this one is better than most of the Werewolf-style clones out there.  I dig the added features to gameplay, like the character identities and powers, the tryals, and the night part of the game, as well as the conspiracy feature and the rotating witch cards.  I'll play this any day of the week over The Resistance or Avalon (which incorporate very little actual gameplay), but I'd similarly rather just play Bang!, which is faster, looser, and more fun.

I do enjoy hidden role games for the social aspect and that is definitely where this game shines.  I also like the card playing aspect and not being able to play cards on yourself forces you to make some moderately meaningful choices. The game box is absolutely stunning and the art was well done. This game will see a lot of play, as it can fit up to 12 players. I wouldn't suggest starting with that many as it can be kind of hectic. I feel like this game shines with 7 or 8 players. Great game, rules were easy to understand, and great artwork. Game play feels kind of like good cop.bad cop with a much darker theme obviously.

A social deduction game without any deduction. The game takes far too long for the level of satisfaction it offers.

Like: The theme is pretty good, and the box is very novel and plays into the feeling nicely. The mafia-like elements not needing someone to sit out and play moderator is helpful.

Dislike: The game is basically a slow whittling down of the cards everyone has in front of them in a systematic, one-by-one basis, until the witch(es) happen to be found and the game ends, or a point is reached that they just win the game. There's no discernible way to determine who is on which team, and so targeting a player is deemed unfair. How much the witch card spreads is random, if the constable dies (or starts as a witch) is random, and that the witch can be the very first card discovered, or the very last card unrevealed is random. Player elimination is harsh, especially given how long the game can last.

Some hidden information games have a lot of social interaction, so you feel like you're deriving information from social cues or tells. Some of them have elements of logic and deduction, so you feel like you're deriving information from logic and research. I'm not sure this has enough of either to hit a sweet spot. But I'm not sure it doesn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
After 2 plays with 4 players.  Has some "resistance" elements, but the interaction here is driven primarily by card play as opposed to direct confrontation or accusation. There is some room for deduction in trying to follow the "witch" cards and how they may have traveled during the game, and who players are protecting or working with by keeping track of the cards they choose to play.  Overall this won't replace resistance or avalon for me, but I will make sure it hits the table when I play with groups that may appreciate a little less direct confrontation with the same strong hidden role feel.

I love the book camouflage of it a lot. The game is really fun. I have played the "Mafia spectrum games" for a long time and Salem has a lot of merits compared to its counterparts. 1. Players don't usually die in the first few rounds; 2. the witch force expands and good guys can get bad!; 3. Cards can only be used on others. And personally, when I play Mafia spectrum games, Werewolves for example, I hate to be someone with special abilities (the seer or the healer) because that much stress interferes with my logic reasoning. So I like that in Salem the Puritans don't have any abilities.

This is another take on the Werewolf genre of games. I think it's much better than Werewolf, but it still shares all of Werewolf's pitfalls -- player elimination, close your eyes setup time, but I like that the Negotiation aspect is enhanced with card playing. It makes each day-night cycle longer, though, but the improvements to the "Witches" killing the Villagers is excellent, as is the ability to pass around the Witch curse to innocent villagers.  Still, I find it inferior to better-designed "Werewolf-Style" games like The Resistance.

I backed the designer's second game Tortuga but declined the offer to add Salem. I appreciate the ability to play and make deductions from cards, since this adds more strategy compared to Ultimate Night Werewolf. However, the player elimination and others' concerns that non-witches have very little information make me hesitate. Still, I'd like to try this.

Salem gives you exactly what you'd expect from a game with this theme:  mass paranoia and rampant accusations.  You have 4 "Tryal" cards in front of you.  If you ever get a witch tryal card, then you turn into a witch and stay that way.  There's also a deck of action cards that lets you accuse and protect people, and each cycle through those cards there's a "Conspiracy" card that makes every player take one of the Tryal cards from his or her neighbor.  Witch cards can spread.  Every action anyone makes is scrutinized.  At the end of the deck of action cards, there is always a "Night" card that makes everyone sleep so the witches can try to kill another player.

The most similar games to this are Good Cop Bad Cop (GCBC) and Werewolf.  Salem is more free form and less random at the same time because the card distribution is more balanced than equipment cards in GCBC and allow much more control than Werewolf.  The only disadvantage to werewolf is player count, but it's about the same as ONUW, which can play more than 10 with expansions, and more than the 8 GCBD allows.

Salem is one of my group's favorite social deduction games now.  One Night Ultimate Werewolf has been falling for us a little lately because newer people have too harsh of a learning curve if we want to play with the more interesting roles.  At least everyone gets a special ability in Salem, and they are varied and balanced.

There is player elimination, but for the most part it happens towards the end of the game more often than not, especially compared to Werewolf or GCBC.  Also, the take that cards should be sparingly used unless you want to be accused of being a witch.

Great social deduction game; brilliant execution of the theme.  Also, it's easily my favorite box in my collection.

Werewolf at its core, but with less player elimination. It accommodates a lot of players, but at the cost of a long play time for the genre. My plays have been sociably loud, with plenty of inaccurate accusation and, eventually, on my third game, I got to play some cards. Mechanically the game is sound enough, but the experience you'll have seems to come down to whether the Witch card moves or not.

A mediocre social deduction game with many issues and better alternatives. The game is too long and fiddly for its genre. The player elimination is frustrating if you go out early, since it will last a while after that and you just watch. There are also a lot of cards in the game with old-fashioned take-that abilities, like making a player skip their turn or discard their whole hand. These are not fun to be on the receiving end of and can lead to people being picked on and not enjoying themselves at all. There is just no excuse to release a game in 2015 with basic issues like this, when there are much better designed social deduction games on the market like One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Spyfall, The Resistance, etc. that bypass these issues.
The one good thing I'll say for the game is that it captures its theme well. The Salem witchcraft trials were full of unfair and one-sided mob violence and were no fun for the losers, just like this game.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting take on social deduction games that puts all players in the town of Salem during the witch trials. Has quite a few similarities to Werewolf and Mafia. There are no forced eliminations, however, so based on cards played (or held) suspicions and alliances may shift before a player is accused of witchcraft. The variable player powers are all interesting if not fun and the rulebook provides some backstory to the characters which is a nice bonus for those who, like myself, are interested in that sort of thing.

A way to play with no game master is outlined, but it plays so much smoother and cleaner with one. The rulebook isn't clear on a few things and it is simpler to have one person who is familiar with the game not be a part of it to look at cards and answer questions. I personally have more fun moderating this than other hidden role social games. The attention to detail is impressive (down to spelling it tryal, as it was at the time) and the art and packaging are both very good. Can play up to 12, but the largest I've done is nine players. It did not feel like it took longer than when we had six or seven which is a big plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
absolutely a Resistance-killer for me.

The part that your team is changing over the course of the game is very interesting than other games. So you can't really "Pin" someone down and know for the rest of the game that you're safe. 

currently my go-to choice as a Liar-style game.

This is not the best hidden role game out there. I know there are others with more strategy, however there are none that cover this great theme and allow you to experience something like werewolf but with a much more subtle and dangerous theme. Is coup fast - yes. Is does werewolf allow for more players - yes. Would I prefer to play either of them after playing this - oh hell no.

This is an interesting twist on a hidden role game. Over the course of the game, players may be converted to the evil team. It's held back by player elimination and a long-ish playtime (compared to other games of the genre). Some parts of the game feel a bit dated for a game that came out in 2015.

Such a cool take on social deduction games. And it looks awesome on the shelf.

Hidden role, traitor mechanisms, but not enough else going on to warrant keeping this one when I already have Avalon and Saboteur

RATING: 6.3
I really like the idea and I love the packaging but I wish there was more information provided. When I play a non-witch, all of my accusations are based on very little. To top things off, the game goes on for quite some time so I can't help but feel like I would rather be playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf or Avalon instead. I also wish the book-box was a little bigger because these cards get handled A LOT and sleeving them means not being able to fit them in the box.

I've broken this out with various groups of people - both more game-inclined and family game novices - and everyone catches on easily and has a fun time playing. It's very easy to learn and once you pick it up, you'll be shouting "witch" at each other in no time! Definitely recommend this for groups. I haven't tried it with less than 8, but it's definitely made for a larger group.

It's always great fun to introduce a game to players and then see them love it first time out. A real hit, with some intense moments, some laughter, as well as cheers and groans. Probably my favourite quick playing hidden identity game.

Fun with really large groups.  I take out the character cards when playing with non-gaming friends.

Games that take a long time and develop investment shouldn't be this fundamentally luck based because it leads to massive and unsatisfying swinging game play. Whether you infect someone as a Witch is random, whether you die instantly as a Witch is random, whether you kill the Constable is random, whether you get the character that is good or not is random, whether you draw good cards is random, losing Constable to Conspiracy is random, the Witch also getting Constable is random and the Witch having both with cards is random.

There is also such little information that there is almost no social deduction since there's no reason to ever trust anyone except for yourself, especially since one of you could easily just become a Witch at some point. It ultimately feels like a contrived, over-complicated RNG game with no suspense and very little social deduction, bluffing and reading people.

If you like long casual games with significant amounts of luck where mastering the game takes only a couple games and most of the complexity is superficial and boils down to a simple end, then this game may be fun for you. For the rest of us, this is definitely one to miss, I'm afraid. It is plagued by fundamentally poor design decisions and the result is quite mediocre.

This game surprised me.  I always love the idea of these social deduction games but the constant need to overtly lie to people's face and make other people out to be liars is a bit stressful for me.  Salem diminishes that through card play while still maintaining the same feel and experience.

The perfect hidden team/role game adds play mechanics that are both fun and simple enough to not get in the way of what ultimately is a social deduction game. I have never found a person who did not enjoy playing Salem after their first game.

This game is super fun and probably best with at least 6 players. It's like Ultimate werewolf but a little more complex. We learned it quickly and had it down after one full turn.

5 after 1 play

Rules seem rather long and somewhat convoluted for a rather simple game. Gameplay was below average as there wasn't many avenues to find out one another's identities, resulting in random targeting of other players. This is worsened by possible random switching of roles during the game.

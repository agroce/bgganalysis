coop trivia game, perfect for people who do not want to play trivia games because they could embarass themselves

RATING: 9
Cooperative trivia game with just the right amount of difficulty.
So far we have won one game out of 5 with 2 players on medium difficulty. Only downside is that there´s only 750 Questions (30 Plays).  Have to get the expansion.

RATING: 7.6
Good trivia game with a lot of challenging questions and brilliant components (the box is the board is the inlay). Great cooperative system but also possible to play a classic pub quiz. A game my girlfriend loves and for sure a blast for the rest of my family (for example at Christmas Eve).

RATING: 7.3
I very much liked the idea of a cooperative quiz game, and the difficulty of questions seemed just right. Others at the table were somewhat less enthusiastic.

Main point of criticism besides the difficulty was of course, as with every quiz game in German language, that many questions apply to Germany rather than Austria.

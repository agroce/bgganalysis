RATING: 6
This is a great press your luck game.    It can be really exciting when you're forced to take risks to stay in the game.  Sometimes they pay out, and sometimes you get crushed, and sometimes it's too little too late.

2008-01-31: Realised I like this game more than I did initially.  Upped rating from 6.2 to 7.

I think determining when to continue to throw the dice beyond the limits of safety is an integral part of the strategy to this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It all makes sense, and the design is clever, but it shows its age. The dice-rolling means that the game is extremely random - maths-based probability-calculating is the only substitute for strategy here. There is tension, as you decide whether to stick or continue rolling. But down-time is a significant issue, especially at four-players. Card-drawing game from the same genre, Diamant (Incan Gold) removes this issue, and makes push-your-luck exciting, as all players advance together. If I wanted to play a dice-roller, I would rather all players were rolling together, as in Dice Town, to reduce down-time.

Can't Stop has all the elements of a classic "traditional" family game. I think we may have moved on a little from this.

I had always wanted to play this one and now that I have, I would buy one if I could find it reasonably easy (like setting on a shelf at a store). It is quintessential in push your luck and it is almost 100% luck at that. But it is so easy to understand and so easy to play. It has a gambling feeling to it in fact which I can't fully explain. I like it.

Can be fun and has a bit of tension at the end of each turn.  Essentially a dice throwing game, it's better than Yahtzee but not by a huge amount.  I gave that a 5, so this deserves a 6.

A bit of a disappointment, but I haven't played it with real dice (only BSW and Roll or Don't).

This is the gateway game for losing your life savings. Half-Seriously, it's a small step from here to a casino. Just keep pushing your luck, keep rolling the dice – you've made the past 3 rolls, what can possibly go wrong with a fourth?

Given the luck involved, this game is a lot of fun!  I rather enjoy it and will gladly play again.

A classic "press your luck" game in which you roll dice to advance your tokens up the board. You can play it safe and save your position until your next turn, or you can try to keep advancing. But if you don't roll the right pair of dice, you lose any advancement you made during that turn.

Our game came with a bonus set of tokens, so we can play with 5.

Recommended with 2-4 players (best 3). 30 mins.

It's ok, maybe playing it a couple more times will help.  Feels like the old dice game "500" where you have to decide if you continue to push your luck.  I can take it or leave it.

can't stop gives me the real deal in terms of pressing luck.  i've played ra, diamant, and cloud 9 and they all have the gimmick but not the emotion.  the fact that when somebody hits a goal nobody else can continue to go for it really makes you care about other peoples' turns, which is huge.  in other press your luck games, you can often go for it and basically end up with a bag of bricks.  in here you're always doing it for clear advancement.  holds up to many, many plays.  i wish there was a smaller official version of it.

Fun, light push-you-luck game with not much thought beyond a little risk assessment, but potentially lots of suspense. It would be a good travel game, the sort of thing to play while waiting for a flight, but the board and box make it too big. Zilch fulfils the same role and you just need six die and pen and paper for scoring.

The title is perfect.  Roll you dice, and make "simple" decisions...  You think you can get it, but maybe you should stop before losing everything... or not.  Funny, light and full of emotion.
Ravensburger edition is quite big and not very nice, but it serves its porpuse right.

Unbelievably clever game, the very essence of the push-your-luck mechanic!
It is short, simple and yet very addictive. A great filler even 30+ years after it has been designed!

The push your luck mechanic should've been retired after this game...

I discovered Sid Sackson as a designer very late, but now I tribute him as one of the true fathers of modern board gaming.

First Impression: For such a small game with so few components, this game is very addictive. I'm not sure whether the game title refers to "Can't stop rolling the dice" or "Can't stop playing the game". The game is quick to learn, quick to play, and can be enjoyed by everyone.

Box shows some shelf wear and someone wrote over the white inscription on the bottom of the box, "How far can you push your luck?" and also the numbers 1-8 twice on the insert.  That being said, the insert is sturdy and includes the rules, the pieces and dice are all present and accounted for and in good shape, all enclosed in a sturdy and serviceable box.  Traded away at GameStorm14 for Candamir: The First Settlers.

Game is complete and in fine shape with all 44 colored squares, 3 white markers, 4 red dice, the rules on the cardboard insert, and the stop sign game board.  The box has no split corners, but does show some shelf wear on the edges, plus a three inch tall permanent black ink "X" just to the right of the board picture.  If this is a concern, geekmail me for pictures.  If you're more interested in the game inside, then it's perfect for you.
Traded away at GameStorm16 math trade for Munchkin Zombies.

This game seems like it should be a game mechanic for a "part" of another game, not a complete game in itself. After winning I don't feel like I did anything and losing doesn't feel sore for the same reason.  That all being said, I find it kind of fun, good for children or "normal people".

After the Gathering, I was inspired to make my own set, since it's out of print and I don't really like any of the versions anyways.  It's very simple and uses the wood pawns and cubes that Jay Tummelson left on Alan's Table towards the end.  The game itself is quite fun, and I enjoy it more than I enjoy other games of its type.  It's really about long-term dice management, rather than short-term, which is what gives it extra flair.

Can't Stop is the epitome of push-your-luck dice rolling, it's oh-so-simple and so aptly named.  Every time you get your hands on those bones, you have to ask yourself, can I get away with just one more?  The most fun you can have gambling without actual money involved.

An excellent push-your-luck game.  The way that the odds of the die rolls are balanced with the ease of claiming a column is genius.  Everyone that I play this game with seems to enjoy it.  The game is simple to learn, and even children should have fun playing (although they often have a hard time knowing when to stop pressing their luck.)

The problem with this game is that everyone I introduce it to wants to play it again and again.  There are only so many times you can play the same game without getting sick of it, and unfortunately this one has gone a little over that line for me.  I still play it and enjoy it occasionally, and I still think it is a superb game for teaching to anyone.  I just thought I would explain why a game, that I originally loved and have played with all my family and friends, has a lower rating from me.

Very fun and easy to learn.  There's some basic math involved here and the strategy does stem around probability.  Lots of great moments when someone pushes it too far and falls flat on their face; or even better, pushes it too far and ~doesn't~ fall flat on their face!  Very easy to learn and seems to be a big crowd pleaser.  The downside is that there can be a lot of downtime between turns and there's really nothing to do; sometimes you'll be waiting forever for your turn, only to have it end in a handful of roles.  Great for the non-gamer crowd, although gamers will find it an entertaining break.

Where the title comes from is easy to be realized when playing Can’t Stop, since it immediately turns on that «just one more» (be it roll or game) only really addictive games are known to spark: the evidence is that, even though I admittedly don’t like abstracts, as soon as I tried Can’t Stop I found myself so enthralled by it that now you can always count on me for joining a couple of games.

Edit: After further playing, I’ve found Can't Stop quite addicting. True to its name, you really can’t stop playing this game: therefore, in February 2012 I raised my rating from seven to eight.

It plays like a game from 1980. Being a child of that time, the look and feel of the game is pure nostalgia. I may not have had a copy from my youth, but I doubt I'll be getting rid of this one. It may feel a bit retro, but it's a solid push your luck game that will never feel old.

Easy and quick to explain, and fairly nicely balanced. Excellent introduction to risk management. I haven't tried using the alternate rules, which try to mitigate some of the "game-y" strategies that will quickly develop. But then, I think discovering those strategies is one of the points of the risk mitigation lesson.

Es un juego de dados en el que el objetivo es avanzar sobre un track en función de la puntuación obtenido y ser el primero en llegar al final. Se tiran cuatro dados y se emparejan dos a dos para obtener puntuaciones, que se aplican a tracks que van de dos a doce. En tu turno puedes tirar todas las veces que quieras, pero en el momento que no puedas avanzar acaba tu turno y pierdes el avance conseguido.

BSW's version of this has players trying to get various climbers up ropes; you get to hear screams when your guys plummet back down the mountainside.

I've taken down my rating a touch on Can't Stop. I think it's very group-dependent: if you've got people who get into the spirit of taunting each other and can treat it more as a group activity than a game, it's fun. Arguably though if you just treat it as a game, it's not as fun. I enjoyed it for a time, but it's more or less hit the end of the line for me; I just don't enjoy it that much anymore. And it's also considerably longer than you might hope. Everyone seems to think of it as a short filler, but it can easily go half an hour or more, which is too long (Liar's Dice has the same problem).

Still a classic, but give me To Crown A King any day.

RATING: 6
Fun push-your-luck game of pairing dice together to climb up a number "ladder".  So, if you roll a 3-5-6-6, you can choose to go up on 8 & 12 or 9 & 11.  The catch is you can only be using three numbers per turn, so if you keep rolling and can't hit any of those three numbers, you bust and lose your turn.  So, the tension is in whether to stop and take what you've got, or keep rolling to get more, risking a bust.

It's hard to stop!

The original push your luck and still today a classic for a reason. Super easy to teach and learn to non-gamers and usually creates a lot of tension between the players.

Has been replaced by Deep Sea Adventure for me but still a great introduction to the push your luck mechanism.

Fear. This game is all about fear to me. My stopping has so much to do with fear of losing what I "have" already. Sometimes it happens because I roll and think I have nothing and then after my stomach drops I find a pair that moves me. That's always an awesome feeling.

But I also enjoy the odd blunting effects in the game that come when you are near the top of a column which discourages others from starting it.

Great little press-your-luck game. This always gets people cheering, laughing, and trying to goad each other into "just one more roll." Has a good amount of risk management/playing the odds and luck (with some lovely tension thrown in). Scales well from 2-4 (though it doubles in length from about 15 to 30 minutes with 3 & 4), which could move it out of the "filler" category for some (however there are some official variants to speed things up with more than 2.) Super addictive, and I'm up for this any time.

I finally got to play this classic, and it’s actually quite a good game for what it is – a push your luck type of game. I like Incan Gold with the right crowd i.e. not serious gamers, but family/friends/kids who enjoy the push your luck element of the game. Can’t Stop is similar in that way and it’s certainly one of the best PYL-games I’ve ever tried. It wen’t over really well with some kids; while they just played on initially and took some huge risks, they quickly understood that you also need to stop at some critical times… But you want to play juuust one more round before stopping! There is a nice layer of strategy (not much; it’s a game driven by luck after all) because you need to take the odds and probability of the dice into account. Will you go for the 6-7-8’s which you need to roll a lot of, but are also more likely, or do you take a chance by moving the 2 or 12? I also really like the race element in the game; if you get to the top in a row, nobody else can use that row! This make the game even more tense, and I like that the game ends immediately when the eventual winner gets 3 cones to the top/finish. Although it might take slightly too long with 4, but that’s really a minor complaint and I would happily play it with kids and family from time to time.

More interesting than Yahtzee, since there is more decision making. I'd rank this as a better teacher of math to younglings and I'd think about buying it if I had some. Younglings, that is. Can't Stop can suffer some from downtime between turns, depending on your opponents, if you aren't so rapped up in seeing how their moves go. There are decisions to be made and then end  can get tight once the columns start locking up. Bottom line - I say this is a bit too boring for adult play. I'd give it a 5 for adult play and a 6 for playing with kids, and call that a 5.5 rating.

Not my favorite lighter game, but not bad. My wife likes it. Although it's rolling dice and hoping for good rolls, there is definitely an addictive quality to the push your luck aspect! I'll be curious to see if this is my wife's favorite filler, or if she turns to other options.

Update: Finally played this two more times after having it sit on the shelf for a while. It's not the most "versatile option." I'd wouldn't play this with four, and reluctantly with three... (there's only so much joy in watching others push their luck). But for a light two player game, it was fun!

One thing for sure, the real game is totally different than playing it on the computer. The computer version is mindlessly playing a slot machine. The real deal is more akin to playing live craps... much more immersive.

Update: Traded this away for Medici. This game continued to sit on the shelf. It's possible that push-your-luck games are simply not my style, but I've picked up a number of more interesting gateway/family games. I just couldn't see this getting played with any regularity.

This is a simple light game that doesn't take much thinking or much effort.

Almost decision free.  Decide what your risk level is before the game, roll until you reach that, pass the dice.  Requires a cheering/booing section to make anything of it, and what you then get isn't much.  Play if you like rolling dice and getting excited about what numbers come up.  Otherwise don't bother.

This is the answer to "Can we take craps and make it an actually interesting game with no money on the line?" All we need do now is find out if it's a question worth asking.

I enjoy playing this on the iPad when I have time to kill and don't want to overtax my brain, but other designers (with all due respect for the legendary status of M. Sackson) have done more strategically interesting stuff with push-your-luck as a mechanic.

Classic game in all senses of the word. Sit down and enjoy this game with some friends and every turn will feel exciting. Even the ones that suck. The swings of fortune are fairly weighted and very much prevalent. The game finishes and even if you lost, you will be wearing a big stupid dice rolling grin.

The actual mechanic output can be a bit fiddly and after every throw there is about a 7 second pause when people try to way up exactly what the hell has happened.

This is a good game to flush out who has the gambling/drug itch out of your friends. It's those who "Can't Stop" that will eventually develop a drug or gambling problem in life and will need some help learning how to stop. This game may also help them learn the value of stopping thereby saving some individuals from a life of strife. It's Christain values are strongly laden in the theme.

My nephews love it, but do I feel bad for getting them addicted to gambling? no, no I don't.

Can't Stop is such a simple concept and easy to teach....but it can last a little longer than it ought to. The tension and the push your luck element are a lot of fun. Its a light chaotic dicefest that really shines when the other players are taunting you and egging you on. This one is great to pull out once in a while, but I think I would definitely get bored at times. For push-your-luck, I prefer something like Diamant that is a more finite timeframe.

Silly dice-throwing game which goes on for too long to make it truly enjoyable. It was interesting to find out what all the fuss was about, but playing as the last player in line of 4 made me decide that once was enough. Muscling in on an 'easy' line is hard and quite pointless too. Were I to chose between dice games, I would prefer the much more interesting Perudo which requires a bit more thinking than the mindless rolling of Can't Stop.

Good math game for the kids to try and make combinations with their dice to keep going.  If you think about it, it is a basic form of Algebra.  I need 9, and I rolled a 5, what number (X) goes with 5 to equal 9.  This one is growing on me.

Important to keep the player count low.  Three seems to be ideal.

Basically, Diamant with dice instead of cards.  First play was a five-player game (using pieces borrowed from one of Pat and Derek's other games).

This is a perfectly fine push-your-luck game, even if it is no more than rolling dice.  My brother suspected I would like this better than others in the genre, and he's right.

Each turn you roll your dice, trying to score combinations to move a limited number of pieces up on each track.  Because 7s are the most likely combination, that track is the longest.  But if you don't roll any of your three combinations later in your turn, you bust and move back to where you started that turn!

Light, simple, would be good for the right group as a filler.

In my opinion this game is just a boring exercise in probability calculation (or abilitiy to intuitively estimate probabilities on the fly).
The game is almost completely dead when someone bothered to do the calculations in advance. However, the calculations are not trivial in this game and it bothers me to play it without having done the calculations, being aware to probably make "clearly wrong" decisions all the time.

was taught to play this Sid Sackson classic by one of the designers of the Avalon Hill game Advanced Civilization.  I had asked her about the "Press Your Luck" mechanic, and she taught me this simple dice game.  This is a great example of good game design - essentially pure strategy in maximizing the odds of random dice rolls - a dice rolling game that is in fact a very compelling game with heavy strategic decision-making.  Very educational for those interested in Game Design theory.

"No, it's in the title: you 'can't stop'. What are you doing stopping on your turn?!"

This is such a quick and simple push your luck game. You get to roll dice endlessly, which is always fun in of itself, and you get to feel careless and free about it if you want to because you can always blame your bust on the game's giant title on the board and box egging you to not play safe.

on 3/17/07 capped two columns, and only one competitor has capped any, and I was one step off of winning the 3's column when Christopher capped two columns including the 3's on the last throw of the dice in a single long turn.

After many years...bumping this up from a 5 to 6.  Sometimes this game just scratches the itch.

Roll 4 dice, make 2 numbers using both pairs.  Mark those numbers on the board.  Stop now or roll again to advance your markers higher.  Try to get 3 markers to the top of the board.  A simple, all luck game, good for a few laughs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Solid push-your-luck die rolling game. Players on their turn roll 4 dice, which they must split into two pairs.  The total of each  pair allows a "runner" piece to be placed/moved on a scoreboard that displays the results from 2 to 12.  The risk element is you can keep rolling and keep pushing your runners up the scoreboard as long as you keep hitting a result you've placed a runner on, or bug out and record your current runner positions.  If you miss a die roll (i.e. don't hit a runner, you lose everything you've gained this turn). The game is over when on player has moved a runner into the end position on their results.  Okay game, works well, but can take a while, and gets very boring before it's half over.  Some of the more recent die rolling games have this oldie beat (see Exxtra, Heckmeck, To Court The King, etc).

Roll 4 dice and split them in 2 pairs to advance on table with numbers 2 to 12. Middle is longer than edges, try to reach to top of 3 columns before others.

This is a pretty fun game.  I found it the day after Christmas at a Thrift, and it was one I was wanting to get since coming here to BGG.  My wife and I played it on New Year's Eve and had a lot of fun playing it.  To get the most out of it though you really have to take the chances of continual rolling and not play it so safe.

This is a classic Sackson game. The copy I have is the Parker Brothers version -- the red stop sign board. It's a nice filler -- one that gets better the more people that play & the faster they play. You roll your dice, move your markers, then decide whether you should push your luck. I've found that this is a game that rewards the bold -- play too conservatively & you're bound to lose. Oh, and if you can find a chap copy of "Advance to Boardwalk" you can add more players to the game (the pieces for both games are compatible, except that the red from "Advance to Boardwalk" and the orange from "Can't Stop" are hard to tell apart.)

Quick to learn. Simple rules. Still requires thinking ahead as to what is going to happen if you head down a particular course of action.

In a four player game, it really tightens up. We had several busts in a row on the first roll of the die.

I like the push your luck element as well. It makes for a good, relaxing warm up game, cool down game, or an evening of light game play with non-gamers.

Overall, this is an excellent game. Mark had traded for a 1980s version of the game. It was wonderfully retro and in fabulous shape. 

This is a game that will last. The components were sturdy. The mix of game elements was fantastic. This would be easy to bust out during the holidays with kids and adults alike.

I need to get a copy of this. Time to look for trade matches!

This is great fun in a convention setting, but outside a ballroom full of people yelling "CAN'T STOP!", the game loses a little something.  It just doesn't seem as exciting without all the yelling, and sometimes it can actually go on a little longer than desired for the nature of the game.  Still, it is the purest form of press your luck, which always poses fun dilemmas.

Can't Stop is a dice and push-your-luck game.  It's very easy.  You roll 4d6 on your turn, make two pairs of dice and use the pips on each pair to advance on 3 tracks (ranging from 2 - 12) with the more frequent rolled numbers (ie 6, 7, and 8) having longer tracks than less frequently rolled numbers (ie 2 and 12).  If you advance on a minimum of one track, you can roll your 4d6 again or stop.  If you stop, you place a marker on the track to show how far you've advanced so that you can pick up your progress from there in future turns.  If you roll, maybe you'll advance on more tracks.  If you roll and can't advance on one of the 3 tracks you've chosen for your turn, you lose your current progress you've made during your turn but not where you're previously placed markers have been saved.  The goal is to get to the end of 3 tracks before your opponent(s).  This game is quick, light and easy but suffers from downtime with each player you add, unless you invest in some serious trash-talking.  It's very fun with 2. If I wanted to play a push-your-luck game with 3 or 4, I would rather play Ra, but this is still a good choice.

I know its a classic, but outside of the nostalgia, there just isn't anything here. There are no long term strategies, nor are there interesting decisions to be made.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/552524 (Face2Face edition)

It has a fun and addictive push-your-luck element, yet it's not pure luck because there's enough decision making to make it interesting. It's also quick enough to prevent the luck from being too frustrating. Suitable for everyone, easy to teach and learn, and attractive components. As far as press-your-luck dice games go, this is a tried and true classic from a master designer, that still has the same appeal as it did when it was first released 30 years ago, and that matches the best of the press-your-luck dice rolling fillers of the modern era.

My copy includes pawns in extra player colours.

I find this to be so clever.  I don't even enjoy it all that much and I find pure push-your-luck rather trivial.  But, even if I wouldn't seek out this game, I probably wouldn't turn it down, either.  It's so fast, so tense (even if the tension is manufactured) and just fun!

Push your luck en el que literalmente no puedes parar!! Vas tirando dados y haciendo columnas de números. Es de lo mas simple, pero muy adictivo y una buena alternativa al parchis o la oca para jugar en la playa.

RATING: 5
Venerable dice game with an innovative mechanic.  The main problem is that turns take too long and leave little for the other players to do.  In a four player game it seems perfectly acceptable to wander into another room while it is not your turn, since you have no control (and little interest) in the little solitaire game that the current player is running.  For quick dice fun, I much prefer Knizia's Exxtra (or Excape).

Matches, if not exceeds, Yahtzee in strategic use of pure dumb luck.

I prefer to play the variant that allows you to hold onto extra runners as long as you can move one on the board up a space. (Example: You have a runner on the 7 and two spares. You roll a 1-5-6-6. You can move the 7 runner up and opt to keep the others in hand or place it on the 11.)

RATING: 9
The pinnacle of quick light games playable with 2 just as well as with 4, providing a decent smattering of tension and some educational value to boot.  What more could you ask for?  Nothing in my book - hence the 10.

EDIT: Rated down to 9 as I've been giving out too many 10s ;)  Haven't played this one in quite a while now but a tournament on BSW refreshed my interest.

RATING: 7
Can't Stop is a push-your-luck game that avoids collapsing into chaos and robbing the player of too much control--and that makes it awesome. Yes, the choices it presents are simple ones, from splitting the dice pool, allocating runners, and deciding when to yield one's turn to one's opponents, but it's oh-so satisfying to watch a runner make it across the board or to see an opponent go too far and bust horribly.

After reading the polarized evaluations of users on BGG whose tastes I admire, I understand why this game divides them. On one hand, the complaints that Can't Stop is an antiquated one-trick pony make an excellent point: it turns on a simple mechanism that builds on itself unrelentingly.  Can't Stop feels repetitious because it is unapologetic in its repetition, repetition grounds the press-your-luck element. On the other hand, this is its virtue since the purity of its design places the dice splitting at the center of the repetition, giving the player some control on the distributing the luck.  

Play two player if you want to avoid the downtime. Play with more if you want a push-your-luck activity with lots of goading, trash talk, and schadenfreude. I can see this being really good with kids.

Interesting push your luck game where you have three climbers and you keep rolling pairs of dice until you stop or roll a number your climbers are not on.

RATING: 9
On your turn, roll 4 dice and make 2 pairs; put your marker down on the chosen results (from 2-12); decide to roll or stop; you have 3 markers available, if you would have to put down a 4th marker or can't advance an existing marker you're busted; once you've advanced your marker by rerolling a result you had before all to the end of that combination, you close it out and noone can choose it anymore.  Win 3 columns and you've won the game.  That's it.

Pushing your luck has never been this fun.  The game accelerates once number start to close out thereby diminishing the possible combinations of pairs.  Vintage Sackson.

Played two games today (5-21-2011), lost both.  Fun game.  Wish I'd known about it years ago.  Played a game today (6-11-2011) and won it for once.  Played another game today (7-16-2011) with both Mr. Billington and Gayle, which I lost.  Even more fun with 3 players, than just 2.  Played it again with just Mr. Billington, one game with 3 goals to win (he won) and one game with 6 goals to win (I won).  We thought maybe try 4 or 5 goals next time.  Another two-player game with Mr. Billington today (2-19-2012) with 6 goals to win, and I won.  Still looking forward to another 3-player game some day.

For a game so dependent on dice rolling, there's actually a fair amount of strategy in there - not a ton, but a fun dose. This is a nice filler with some interesting and fun choices. I love the "push your luck" element. The main caveat is that there is lots and lots of math - albeit simple addition. You must play with people who don't mind it, and it helps if they can do it quickly or else the game will drag.

Like most luck-based games, there are times when this doesn't even qualify as a game. One time I got to take a total of two turns (6 dice rolls) while the other person rolled the dice about 20 times and won on their 3rd turn. Mercifully short, at least. Games like this depend on cognitive biases for their entertainment value -- we're less attuned to the luck that went into a win than into a loss, so we can feel a sense of accomplishment that isn't really deserved.

Can't Stop har efterhånden fået karakter af at være lidt af en klassiker. Spillet er fra 1980 men væsentlige dele af spillet genfindes i et af Sid Sacksons tidligere designs The Great Race fra 1974. Den væsentlige forskel mellem disse to spil er press-your-luck elementet, der vel i bund og grund også er det, der alt efter smag og behag enten får Can't Stop til at skinne eller til at falde fuldkommen til jorden.

For mit vedkommende har spillet en sært dragende effekt - men desværre har det det også med at skuffe hver gang det påny har fået fat i mig. I virkeligheden finder jeg nok, at det er et meget elegant lille spil med så få regler at det uden besvær kan præsenteres på to minutter. Hvis man var i stand til virkelig at tage press-your-luck delen til sit hjerte og ikke tage det for mere end det er, kan jeg godt forstå, man kan tage spillet til sit hjerte. Og Can't Stop har en tro følgerskare, der elsker det. Desværre er det ikke lige min genre og selvom jeg godt ville holde mere af det, end jeg gør, bliver det aldrig et favorit-spil. Men for at være fair syntes jeg, at det er et solidt filler-spil og hvis man i modsætning til os, der oftest har spillet det to spillere i stedet spiller fire spillere med et deraf øget pres for at prøve lykken med endnu et terningeslag, kan jeg sagtens se Can't Stop levere større fornøjelser, end vi har oplevet med det. Can't Stop er et klassisk eksempel på et spil, der hvis det hørte hjemme i en langt mindre æske ville have en meget større overlevelseschance hos os.

Homemade version.  Play the unique rule for extra tension.  Another (Carcassone?) variant is to limit players to only 6 markers. It makes you more choosy and makes you think about finishing a column and returning counters to other players.  Does that make any sense?  Can't believe I've played this nearly 200 times in less than a year.  At 15 minutes a game that's almost 2 days non stop playing.  Scary!

Update:  Now up to 365 plays.  That's nearly 4 days!  (Gulp!)

[Original comment] I have always liked this game. Although it is luck-based, it also involves trying to predict your luck, based on the known odds of dice rolls. Good family game.

May 2009 -- This is one of the earliest push-your-luck games I recall playing, and it is still a fun game to play.

Ocotber 2011 -- We don't play this very often, but I still enjoy it whenever we do so.

The best in this game - the monstruous amount of luck. It doesn't pretend to be some sophisticated 3-hours-long strategy game of civilization building or anything. You roll the dice and make ONE decision: you either roll once again or you put you pawn on the board. Once you've done that it's another player's turn. That's it.

What I like about this game is that it leaves you with some choices. Not a big ones but enough to make it entertaining. That's all.

Pretty enjoyable, except that watching the other player take her turn is a snoozefest.  I try not to play with any more than two players.  The game situations are more interesting with three or four players, but the downtime is agonizing.  Try the variant in which two players may not stop on the same space; I think it makes for more interesting decisions.  My rating for the solo computer version "Roll or Don't" is higher, 7/10.

Great "push your luck" game that with elegant, easy to teach rules. It's abstract in nature but I enjoy the mountain climber's theme due because busted rolls feel like you slipped up and fell back to where you started your turn.

I really enjoy the mechanic where you roll 4 dice and split them into two pairs. It creates tense choices that don't feel totally unfair since you have some control over it.

It took me a while to decide that Can't Stop is the best "push your luck" die-rolling game I've ever played. (Exxtra was a strong competitor for the title.) I really like the fact that you can tailor your play based on actual strategies (rather than simply responding tactically to the current situation).

The fact that columns are locked out is a very important rule -- it forces you to consider your opponent's position when deciding to stop or roll again. This is particularly important given the game's otherwise solitary aspects.

Tényleg nehéz megállni!
Egy kedves barátom kérésére próbáltam ki a játék online verzióját a BGA oldalán, amely már előzetesen is kellemes kikapcsolódást ígért kockadobálások és „meri vagy nem meri” döntések elegyeként. 2-4 játékos próbál meg a tizenegy 2-12 közötti számozású oszlopból 3-at elsőként elfoglalni. A rendelkezésre álló 4 kocka eldobása után kockapárokat alakítanak ki, majd választásuk szerint, de kötelező jelleggel lehelyezik ideiglenes jelzőiket a pályára. Mindig az első helyen kezdenek, majd a további kockadobásokkal haladhatnak felfelé a különböző hosszúságú oszlopokon (minél kisebb az esélyed olyan számösszeget dobni, annál kisebb az adott oszlop, így van kicsit kiegyensúlyozva játékmenet). Amikor csak akarod, megállsz és véglegesíted helyzetedet. Ha éppen egy oszlop tetején állsz, akkor azt elnyerted, oda többé senki ember fia fel nem mászhat, te vagy a helyi főmaki. Ha nem értél fel, akkor a többi játékos téged megelőzve feljuthat oda, elcsaklizva tőled a maki címet. A gond akkor kezdődik, ha a 3 ideiglenes jelződ egyikével sem tudsz haladni a kockadobásod után, nem tudsz olyan párokat kialakítani, hogy mozgathasd őket. Ekkor minden abban a körben elért haladásod elveszted és visszacsúszol, nincs banán, csak a nagy kérdés: „Miért nem álltam meg?”. Az emberben folyamatosan jelen van a „csak még egy és abbahagyom” érzés. Valaki megteszi, valaki kockáztat. Valakinek bejön, valaki lecsúszik. Mókás kis játék nagyon sok szerencsével. Gyerek részére is könnyen tanítható, felnőtteknek is lehet élvezetes kikapcsolódás. Nekem tetszik.

About as good as abstract push your luck games get. Which still isn't particularly exciting. Sid Sackson is hailed as the first American Eurogame Designer, but this has nothing resembling a Euro, and not even much resembling fun. Basically, roll sevens, sixes, and eights, and you can push your luck til the cows come home. 2's and 12's mean you'd better stop. Simple. Roll or Don't (computer version) can be played quickly, but I can't even imagine how fiddly this would be in real life. 

UPDATE: Having now played this in real life, I'm actually significantly more entranced with it. Granted, it's still very simple, but it actually is surprisingly fun. The emotional ups and downs of good and bad rolls here are really what make the game, not the mechanics itself. Playing alone on the computer is not nearly the experience that playing with a raucous group of friends is.

It's a dice-rolling game.  Need I say more?

Okay, I'll add this: I heard of a variant where if you have only one column left to win, then you literally Can't Stop rolling until you've won -- the ultimate press your luck game!  That adds some interesting strategic choices.

I think of Can't Stop as Advanced Craps, without the betting. If you enjoy the excitement of Craps, and want to make a couple choices along the way, you'll enjoy Can't Stop. I'd bump this up to a 9 with the right group.

Also, I really dig the presentation of the French Asmodee edition, with the bald guy. He rocks, as does the portable board.

I realized my previous comments were too nice to this game.  You can read my review and responses for why I don't like this game.

It's slow for being a dice game, and it's just not much fun.  A couple bad rolls of the dice at inopportune times can suddenly break your chances to win.  At that point you're just a spectator, waiting for someone to just finish it so you can start again.  It lacks any depth or randomness other than the dice themselves.  Look at the card systems in Risk & Roll 2000 or To Court The King and there is some actual strategy to be had.  You feel like you're actually making some choices rather than just throwing the same 4 dice over and over hoping for the best.

RATING: 8
This is a great "push your luck" game, and accessible to young players (say 5 yrs and up).  It teaches a bit of probability theory, including "expected value".  It is quick, and often involves jeering from opponents.  

Downside, the winner is often someone who switches from "optimal" play to "push your luck" half-way across the board.  This give a high random winner effect (but what else would you expect from a dice game?) that irritates those who want more strategy from a game.

I hate pure luck games and I hate the sort of push your luck style, but this does it better than any other!!

There are genuine tactical decisions to be had throughout the game and there are complex risk management analysis that can be done.

With all that in mind you can justify playing it to yourself but still enjoy some knockabout fun

I just can't stop saying good things about this most perfect game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Roll four dice, making two totals with two dice each. Move your marker up along the appropriate number from 2 to 12. It's a race to see who can get three of their markers to the top of 11 numbers first. As long as you can keep rolling numbers that you have marked this round (up to three), the markers keep going up. However, if you "bust", as in you did not roll any of the three numbers you marked, then all progress for this round is lost.

Neat game of pushing your luck, and putting your trust in the Law of Large Numbers (or was it probability?). Good filler for quick, boisterous, action-filled fun. Solid '7'.

My wife and I were looking through the website the other day (she humors me so) and somehow we landed on this game.  I had read about it before in it being the ultimate in push your luck games but I didn't think to much of it.  When my wife saw a picture of it and I explained how popular it is she got excited and said the she used to have the game as a kid.  A few weeks later, we go up and visited her parents and my wife went searching for the game.  It had been stored in a garage where her parent's cats slept for 15 years!  We pulled it out, washed off the years of dust, dead bugs and cat fur and voila! another game is added to my collection.  Everything was still there.  The box, on the other hand...

You can stop, of course, and deciding when to do so is key to the strategy. Can be a little slow if people take too long with their decisions, and works best with two for that reason (you'll be watching others rolling dice a lot either way, though). It's still one of the better push-your-luck dice games around, and the stop-sign gameboard gives immediate sense to your odds.

Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: The classic press-your-luck game. Roll three dice, choose a pair, and move your marker up in the corresponding column. But you can only have a marker in three columns during your turn. If you ever roll without being able to place, you lose all of your progress this turn.

Pro: Fast and easy. The ideal example of press-your-luck. Combines randomness with some probability. Well balanced, no inherently bad rolls. Creates tough choices, forcing players to take risks. Quick enough that it's suitable for repeated replaying.

Con: No theme. Not much variation or interesting complexity.

Very enjoyable press your luck dice game.  I picked this up super cheap as a kid at a rummage sale in the early eighties and loved it.  However, because none of my friends had even heard of it I had problems finding many takers to play with.  Over the years that old version disappeared both from my possession and from my memory.  Jump to 2007, and I'm a parent in my 30's when I discover that Face2Face is releasing a new stop sign version of this game.  I snatched it up and coerced my wife into a game.  While I can still see why I liked it as a kid, and actually still quite enjoyed it, my tastes run to games with a bit more depth now on the occasions when I get to play.  5/07

RATING: 5
Schematic in the 1st phase (until 6, 8 and 9 paths are completed).  There is also significant downtime then.

Dice-rolling is probably my least favourite mechanics, but what stops the game from getting more than a '5' from me is its weight.  It's reeeally light...

This is OKAY, very light filler game and not a lot better than Yahtzee if at all, the push your luck element is really ALL there is to the game, nothing else, roll, roll again, etc. bust or stop, mindless fun. 

That said, a little bit of tension and fun can be had but there are much better fillers out there and ones that involve push your luck also, even Lost Cities is better than this IMO though that isn't saying a whole lot. I really like 'push your luck' games like RA and I do prefer Diamant over this one, this doesn't do it for me, a little fun here but slightly overrated on the Geek from nostalgia no doubt.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (November 2011)

I played it for the first time in Yucata and it was a very boring game. After I played it on Board Game Arena it was much better because it was a live play and I think you need to play it face to face to really appreciate this game. I like Toss up so I believe I will like this game. For now I´m upping the rating to 6.5.

So much better to play this face to face, I bought the game and I really like it. Great way to end the night. The game board is very big making it harder to storage and to transport it, but it looks great with all the pieces on it.

A keeper in my book, in fact I already ordered the extra game part so we can play up to 6 players, but I still think it is best with 4.

Due to its elegance, I prefer this to many other "push your luck" alternatives like Liar's dice and Incan Gold. With 2p I recommend the "not allowed to stop where another piece is already" house rule. Not sure why this game is as fun as it is, given it's largely a simple probability puzzle.

Can't Stop is a great family game.  The pace of play is fast and the game is exciting.  The rules are also very very simple, which was a strong selling point for me.  I wanted a game that a fast paced and intense nature, but also one that my family and my parents would enjoy (surprisingly, getting mom and dad to sit down for a game of Agricola is kind of hard.  Go figure).  

My only gripe about this game is the absolutely ridiculous MSRP - $35!!!  After playing it once, my sister in law made the game with a piece of paper and some spare change so she could play with her family.  The components are relatively nice, but at anything above $20 this game is a relative rip off for an IP that is going on 30 years old.

(Note: I am a *serious* math geek, and so probably am rating this game higher than you would.)

One of the better "push your luck" style games I've played.  It's simplistic.  However, it tends to make for a lot of analysis paralysis.  It seems like each turn you have two moments of real thought.  One, which combination do I make?  Two, do I push my luck?  Both of these tend to take awhile, especially making the best possible die combinations.  So, good game, but seems to overstay its welcome a bit.

This is a fun push your luck game in which dice allow players to move up tracks ranging from 2-12. A player rolls four dice and can add any two to move pawns up the path with that total for up to three tracks per round. The player can stop and place markers to hold the spots or hope for luck and roll to keep moving. If a roll gives numbers that can't be placed on the three tracks, all progress for that round is lost. It is possible to try to make progrss on a different set of three tracks each round. There is strategy in understanding the dice rolling odds and taking into account the other players' progress.

One of my favorite dice games.  I can see how a lot of push your luck games are derivative of this one - the game length is just right for something of this weight, and turns are nice and quick, which can be a big problem in games like Pickomino.  It has the right balance between ease of progress and need for a lucky roll that makes this such a hallmark of the genre.

Update, July 2012
After almost 50 plays this needs to go up to a 10 (from an 8). It's always fun to play - goading your opponents, inviting a lesson, teaching a lesson, rubbing it in by winning more columns than necessary. What makes the game so great is that it's so simple, so short, but intense enough to provide lasting memories of cool moments.

The computer game makes this seem almost completely void of meaning, even if it's probably the best of the push-your-luck dice games I've come across. Supposedly it only works when played quickly and in high spirits (although the computer version does manage one of those).

The first player advantage/last player disadvantage is significant: whoever goes last or has an investment taken away must risk more with each roll just to catch up and likely never will, so it's a rare game where everyone's actually competing.

I like dice, so naturally, I like Can't Stop.  I also like press-your-luck games, and this one really fits the bill.  Although I am not a risk-taker in "real life," I definitely "can't stop" when playing this one.  My normally risk-taking husband, on the other hand, plays it safe in Can't Stop. Not sure what this flip-flop says about us.

A play session usually takes under 20 minutes. A nice little push-your-luck game that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. It certainly has strategy, but never so many decisions that anybody gets AP. Just a fun little game that everybody enjoys and over which they can easily socialize while playing. If your group/family likes to play this game, they'd probably like [thing=9851][/thing] or the newer [thing=34943][/thing].

Players roll 4 dice and divide them into 2 pairs. They then add each pair and advance 1 spot in each corresponding column. If players cannot advance, they lose all progress made that turn.

The Good: A fun, push-your-luck dice game that plays well even with 2 players, and up to 4. It is a light game that does not overstay its welcome.

The Bad: It is limited to 4 players.

To say I own this may be stretching the truth. After learning the game, I drew the grid on a thick piece of paper, and play with Icehouse pieces. The Icehouse pieces are great for this. I need a slightly better board, though. The one down side is that a person's turn can go on for a while, leaving the other player(s) nothing to do while they wait.

Clever, simple design holds up well even 36 years later, which is a testament to Sid Sackson's brilliance. Nonetheless, my tastes run more towards heavy euro than light, push-your-luck, so this isn't gonna make my top 100, but its great for what little is there.

A fun press your luck game that the family will easily get into. If the game was rated just purely on the fun factor I'd say it was a borderline 8. The game is more exciting with more players. There will definitely be a lot of tempers flaring when someone takes the number you were working on judiciously in one fell swoop on a series of crazy rolls, but that makes this one all the more better!

THIS IS A CLASSIC. 
MY SCORE REPRESENTS MY FEELING AFTER 555 PLAYS FACE2FACE
(have played also against AI and humans through internet but I don't log these)

three player game : 4 on top or three in a row. (back to normal after 300+ plays)


Very simple, but highly enjoyable game. Have the reprint with stopsignboard. You have got to get that version. Probably the best filler. (Haven't played them all)This games is playable by a very wide range of gamers.Allthough people will say that luck is an important factor. I believe strategy to be as important.If there is one game to give to a person I absolutely know nothing about this is it. so would make a perfect secret santa gift)

Logged plays are mostly 3 P games. I have only Logged 2 plays against computer opponents. 300+ games with my uncle and his wife.

After 100+ games I'm rating this down to an 8. (from 8.5) 

after 222+ games rating goes to a 7. 

300+ games. I have had enough of this game. hence the 6.

350+ games
Back to playing to three on top even in a three player game.
four on top gets pretty dull sometimes.
I want to introduce stealing columns.

425 games. 
Stealing they won't play. We can't finish our turn on top of someone now. This makes it a little bit more strategic and tense.
So i upgraded it to a seven where it will remain.

500+ games

Oh boy .... Really tired of playing this again and again.
It is my understanding that you should try and finish a number in two turns. maybe in three.
But it looks like it is basicly a good idea to go for it and if you don't make it try it again next time. don't leave it short to the top forcing your opponent to take risks. That actually might work in a 2P game. but certainly not with 4P

may 2013
I occasionly get this to the table and I am amazed how good it is. I wasn't going to give a 10 to a boardgame  but this one is perfect. 

Current winnigstreak 12 games in FtF 3P or more (highest before was 9)

Dont log my plays anymore. decided to log another one.
I probably have played this over 700 times face to face using the boardgame... and about 100 games against ai

Another excellent game from Sid Sackson. Roll 4 dice, pair them up, and record the numbers. On a turn you can collect 3 different numbers and you can keep rolling until either you cannot make any of your numbers or you decide to stop at which point you bank your achievments (eg 3 x 7's a 2 and 2 x 5;s). A game I thoroughly enjoy and often crash in.
Highly reccomended as introductory game to non-gamers.

Often referred to as the ultimate in 'press your luck' games. I prefer a luck-pressing element whose probability changes continuously as new information is revealed (Risking in Beowulf, Last remaining player in Ra). It's a simple and fun design to kill some time with, and I like it for that. I have way too many good or better games for this to be hitting the table on any kind of regular basis.

RATING: 5.5
You roll 4 dice and arrange them into 2 pairs which sums are used to determine the columns (numbered 2 to 12) your cones can advance. You can roll how many times you want to, but you have to be able to advance at least one column marker after every roll and you have just 3 markers available in one turn. So the main elements of the game are luck and decision of when to stop rolling and fix the positions of the cones. I little bit too dicey game for me.

Gambling game. Some fun at least AND because this one is fast enough, it works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 & 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 & 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 & 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost.

Press Your Luck is one of my favorite game mechanics and few do it better than Can't Stop. Really my only beef with the game is its scalability. 2 players is perfect. 3 players is pretty good. 4 players turns it into a torture device. If we have 4 players we would rather play it tournament style and watch others play rather than play with all 4 players at one time.

A solid, simple game.  I like it because of the simple understanding of statistics that goes into the decisions.  I think that for a lot of people that may be lost on them and it seems like a game that is 100% luck based.

So I enjoy it but understand not everyone is.

The theme is paper-thin.

It's very fast to play though, especially online.

I do appreciate the fact that the theme is unique.  You're a mountain climber who wants to be the first one to climb 3 peaks.

Since I started playing board games Can't Stop has represented the holy grail for me.  But like some luckless knight every time I have come close to this revered object then some evil force has conspired against me and foiled my attempts.  At last these dark forces have been defeated, I have played the game and I am not disappointed.  Can't Stop should act as the template for all push your luck games; easy to pick up, enough choices to make each player pause before rolling the dice (or passing), a great race element and plays quickly enough to give anyone who feels unjustly treated by the dice another chance.

I owned the wonderful Parker Brothers version of this game when I was a kid, but, sadly, seem to have given it away to a younger cousin at some point or another.

UPDATE: Okay, maybe I was a tad harsh here.  I've bumped my rating a point, although I'm still not quite sure why gamers like this so much as a filler.  There are better dice (Liar's Dice) and push your luck (Diamant) games out there.

Although I realize that there is a real game here, I simply can't get into it properly.  I haven't given up on it, but for now I will only play this if specifically asked to, and even then only if I'm in the right mood.

Comments entered on 02 Apr 2010:

Can't Stop is a press-your-luck game that can sometimes result in blowout wins by a player or by neck-and-neck finishes.

This was frequently played while waiting for dinner to cook because the components are extremely durable to getting food and drink near it.

RATING: 9
Fun game. Not so much 'beer and pretzels' as simply the beer, or maybe just the pretzels.

Rules Clarification: There are 11 tokens per player, 1 token per column. Each column never has more than 1 token of each player color. A new token is added to a column only when that column has no existing token of the given color. An existing token in a column is moved up when that column is marked again rather than adding a second token of that color to the column. The above will help people like me who read rules literally as written. Ignore pictures of this game showing the same color represented twice on a given column/number; those pictures are wrong. 

Preferred Scoring Variant: (Players/ColumnsToWin) 4/3, 3/4, 2/5

Play the Blocking rules - much more strategy. Sliding rules are also fun, adding more strategy as well and also making for a quicker game.

Try my Short Stop variant for another fun and fast way to play with 2 players (in the files section for this game).

Probably the best push-your-luck game ever.  It boils down the essence of this type of game into a simple ruleset, making it simple, yet challenging.  If you like this type of game, this is a must-buy.

My rating of a "6" is based on my preference for this type of game.  In the world of push-your-luck games, however, this is certainly a "10."

I have played this on iOS, innumerable times but this is the first time live.  It was fun.  Counting out the options is a little harder live than when the iOS does the numbers for you.  

Roll four dice, and make combinations of two dice between 2 and 12, and pick 1 or 2 numbers that you rolled.  You must use two numbers if cannot make a combination that sums to the same number twice.  Once you lock in three numbers you must roll those numbers again or you bust and go back to where you were.  You try to move three white cones up a track.  High probability numbers take more steps than numbers with low probability.  You can stop at anytime and lock in your gains.  But sometimes you can't stop.  

Very fun.  Does stay a little longer than I would like though.

Oh, I can stop. Every time. And while I respect and even admire the ingenuity of Sid Sackson in turning a very simple rule into a demanding probabilistic puzzle, this just lasts too long to be enjoyable, at least when playing with more than two players. I could stand at as a quick pastime on a computer, and writing an algorithm for the bots would be an interesting challenge, but putting the actual game on an actual table is something I can live without.

RATING: 7
Too simple. You have almost no sgnificant choice or control. There is no significatn excitement, whether I keep on rolling or quit rolling earlier.

It feels not like a game, rather like a draft of a game. There are better push-your-luck games, and better dice games.

--UPDATE--
Tried again with a variant, which prohibits you from stopping when your pawn is on other's marker. NOW this game was fun. Without this variant, keeping rolling is rarely good choice. Because while you don't lose much with stopping, when you risk possible gain is relatively small and  possible loss with risk is huge. So usually all the players stops without risk, this game becomes a kind of "snakes-and-ladders" game. There's no fun. With this variant, however, often you are forced to risk. When you don't want to be forced, you should stop early. Now there is some tension, interesting choice, and fun!

[b]I didn't find it particularly addictive or fun the single time we played my physical copy, so I gave it away. If I want to play, I can do so on yucata.de, which I like better. Less fiddly and takes up no space on my notoriously overcrowded shelves. Still, it is pretty random, and I think there are fewer interesting decisions to make than in some other press-your-luck games, such as "Port Royal". Nice for some quick online dice-rolling when I don't want anything challenging, but doesn't do much for me.[/b]

RATING: 7
Can't Stop is a simple, yet very fun push-your-luck dice rolling game.  The board is arranged into 11 columns, which are numbered 2 through 12.  On a player's turn they roll four dice.  They then add the values of two sets of dice together to come up with two numbers.  They then place a cone of their colour on the columns corresponding to the two numbers they just came up with.  You can have up to three columns going at once.  Players will keep rolling as much as they want, or pass to lock in their progress.  The more you roll, the more chance you have of climbing up the columns you're working on.  However, if you get a roll that you can't use you lose all progress made this turn.  If you are first to get to the top of a column you claim it.  The first player to claim three columns wins!

It's a quick game.  And it can get pretty intense as players vie for those columns.  The push your luck element comes through very well.  You keep thinking, should I roll again, or stop and lock in the progress I've made so far?  But will that be enough?  Really fun, and great to play with kids.  Highly recommend.

RATING: 6
Nice, quick, dice rolling game.  In a single game there is a very high luck factor, but over time a better player will win more games.

Though I have not done any heavy calculations, I suspect that knowing the probability of rolling a specific number as well as that of rolling any one of three numbers would be of immense help in determining which numbers to go for at the beginning of the game.  Later in the game, such decisions are often dictated by your opponent(s) positions on the board.

A solid dice game which has some down time with more players.  But the use of statistics and the bell curve for dice is used to great effect.  Long live Sid Sackson!!

Simple system, but it works well. It is a dice-fest, but this game is simply fun to play at the end of a game night. For a dice game, it takes too long though. A dice game shouldn't last longer than 20-30 minutes, then it becomes a waste of valuable gaming time. This can overstay its welcome.

Very frantic game of push your luck.  It's so fast, you won't mind the luck base mechanic.  In fact, the game is base on that.

You can also have some strategy, unlike what one might think.  All in all, it's nonetheless a very basic game, for my taste at least.

Game in a Nutshell: Be the king of rolling a certain couple numbers. Roll to establish your numbers, keep rolling and adding on, but stop before you don't roll your numbers or you'll go bust.

Played as: 4 player softwate vs AI

Pros: Probably the best implementation of dice in a press-your-luck format. Can be tried out via software before buying but no doubt carries more tension when played with real people and dice in hand.

Cons: The game isn't so original that it can easily overcome its simple concept and sound too appealing. 

Other: It's all about rolling, rolling some more to hit your numbers then stop when you've had enough. I'm guessing interest will wain after the initial novelty wears off, but may not be all that horrible to play from time to time.

Best Use: An average filler or play with grandma.

Not totally luck, but a lot of luck.  There's a little bit of skill thrown in, but just a smidge.  The strategies are fairly easy to figure out once you've played once.

Easily the most fun/interesting of the dice-chucking press-your-luck games we've been experimenting with around here, beating out Farkle and Decathlon. I like the continuous if minor decision-making and the opportunity for slightly strategic play. I'm a little worried that a dominant strategy has already emerged, shifting this to more of the total luck fest that the other two games are, but still we got a couple games in before that became apparent.

This is a really ingenious design which tricks players into feeling like they are engaged in a intense strategic contest - even though the gameplay is a celebration of pure randomness!

UPDATE: actually, this started to fall pretty flat among groups I introduced it to.  Even alcohol can't get you to really whoop it up over another player's die rolls, and there IS a lot of downtime.  A classic, but I traded it away.

Oh yeah!  This is what light, good, nutritious gaming is all about.  I don't know how the replay value will be, but after one play I want to teach it to everybody. However, and I think this was the result of playing in the morning, but we found the rules just a touch opaque, and had to read them over a few times to really get the very simple game.  Also, the "push your luck element" takes some time to engage.  But look out when it does!

Can't Stop is pure push your luck. You roll four dice and attempt to move your pieces up tracks using pairs of the dice, but you can only move three of the tracks each turn so it you don't roll a pair of dice equally those numbers you bust! 

Some downtime with four players but a lot of fun!

Picked this up at a thrift store to finally try out. It's a good game for its time, and the dice coupling is a standout mechanism, even by today's standards.

RATING: 5.5
Fast playing push-your-luck game with simple rules but a nice level of tactical depth for such a simple concept. Roll the dice and make the best use of what you roll... and then take the risk of rolling "just one more time" to rise up the charts before others reach the top before you. I've played this a few times now and I'd have to say there just isn't a whole lot here to make me overly excited. The game is very simple and easy enough to learn and teach. It's also got a bit of strategy/tactics in it. What more could you ask for in a quick filler you say? Well.. it's just that it's all about probabilities and luck... and that's all. Now I realize that this game has an elegant simplicity that many say elevates it above the level of most little dice games and yes there is a bit more here than meets the eye with the push your luck aspect which brings a bit of psychology into play. All in all though it's fairly repetitive... roll dice... either roll again or stop and play it safe. I would say that there likely needs to be some other mechanism in the game coupled with this push your luck aspect that would then likely make the game not so one dimensional and repetitive. 

In the end though as it stands... Can't Stop is a decent diversion if you want to play a quick filler game with a bit of tactics/strategy. It's good for a few chuckles but not a game I'd play over and over again very often. I actually looked at revising my rating after my last play as I thought the game was a bit better this time than the first couple times I played... but 5.5 is a pretty accurate rating for it. Put it this way... I could see this going as high as a 6 but no higher if we don't pay it too often and on the downside I could eventually see this dropping to a 5 as well if it's overplayed.

Intriguing mechanism where the sum of selected dice determine which track you advance along and where you continue until you want to "save" or roll such that you can't advance along any of your tracks. Normally I don't like push your luck games but this is an interesting take where your decision must be based both on probabilities (easy but long vs difficult but short track) and the decisions by the other players.

Players roll 4 dice, then form pairs to move up along a board. If you re-roll, get more chances to advance, but if you miss your original numbers, lose all you have gained that turn. Players race to be first in advancing along several numbers. It's all based on dice rolling, but it's not chaotic or totally random. Roll the dice, play the percentages, and make your decisions. Quite fun.

RATING: 5
Played online and relatively enjoyed. I think push your luck games tend to be engaging for short, relatively tense dice/card fests, and I like that in very minor doses. Still, given the choice, I'd rather play something that gives more difficult decisions and is more strategic. This is not a bad game per se, but its just a game type I don't care for that much (party/filler games). It is good for what it does though.

Plays: 2+?

RATING: 9
A great game, especially if played in the right spirit -- it's always fun to goad people into taking stupid risks, and then watch them bust ;-)  Alternately, have fun mocking your opponents' conservative play, and then steal their unfinished columns with a series of daring throws!   This game is always good fun, and the trashtalk only makes it better.  Good to play when very tired, or a bit drunk :-)

I have the Parker Brothers edition, which is extremely ugly but also very practical.  In fact, I often boast that it's the ugliest game in my collection.  The gameplay makes up for that, though.

A design to admire. It's one of the purest push your luck games, turning basic probability into something that players think that they can beat. When you fail, you usually only have yourself to blame. There's a slight issue with downtime between turns, but guaranteed a place in my collection for life.

The most amazing thing to me is that I played this game for the first time at the 2004 GoF! Unfortunately, I lost in the finals of the tournament; if I won I would have had first overll pick from the prize table in 2005 :-( Though it's a game of luck, I feel more in control of things than in most dice games, which I guess is why I like it so much.

An average push-your-luck game.  Simple mechanics make this accessible and highly competitive.  The statistical probability of certain numbers make some choices a no-brainer, but having first-player advantage can force you into selecting numbers that you do not want to.  Some games can grind to a halt through dud rolls, and there are other games where, because of the antequated nature of the game mechanics (and the lack of dice roll mitigation), you are stuck with nothing to do but roll badly while your opponent(s) roll well. A bit too much luck for me.

RATING: 5
Can't Stop is a Push-Your-Luck game focused on the capricious nature of dice rolling, and nothing else. The way Sid Sackson distilled gameplay down to the very essence of what dice do is rather impressive in its mathematical symmetry.

Unfortunately, Can't Stop's lack of theme saps players' interest as the only answer to the question of 'Why are we rolling these dice anyway?' is 'Because its what we do'. Had some kind of betting (or drinking) mechanic been added, Can't Stop would have much greater appeal.

I'm glad Mr. Sackson didn't apply an arbitrary limit to the number of rolls per turn a player can make, but its a double-edged sword as the open-ended turns mean it can take awhile for yours to come around. (Had the fore-mentioned betting or drinking mechanic been added it would have given non-active players something to do while they waited.) Also, it is mathematically possible, though unlikely, for a player to win on their very first turn.

As player motivation is an important aspect to all games, and sadly lacking in this one, Can't Stop feels somehow incomplete. What is there is a beautiful examination of dice rolling odds, nothing more. As such, I feel Can't Stop deserves to be in some kind of game museum where it can be admired and inspire designers to build upon its mechanics.

RATING: 7
A push your luck game where you roll two dice, take the sum, and move your scoring track up that number's track.  Since 7's happen more than 12's you will need to get more of them.  Pick three sums and get their tracks to the top.  It's quick, it's dice, and people have fun.  If I liked push your luck games more, this would be rated higher.

Mindless fun. It's apparent there are some optimal # combinations to improve your odds, but I haven't spent the time to figure them out. Good game to teach discrete probability distributions to kids (or even adults).

UPDATE: This game has some serious downtime. Even my kids get bored playing this - and they LOVE rolling dice. They spend most of the game stacking their tokens. Now, they'd much rather play Airships. 7 -> 6

Just found at Saver's for 2 dollars!  Complete--actually 3 extra markers and an extra die.  The box is a little beat, but I'm really happy about this one!

Fun game!  I wasn't actively searching for this--I actually thrift in hope of finding Acquire--but this was a great find of another Sackson game.  This is another game that I tried first on BSW and was pretty sure my wife would like. I was right and I'm pretty sure even my mother-in-law will like this!  She likes Bunko and Pass the Pigs.

IMO, plays much better with two or three.  It bogs down a lot with four as too many columns get finished.  Ends up taking too long and eliminating the interesting choices.

規則:
遊戲設置:
● 每名玩家並拿取對應顏色的11個棋子，記分標記放置於0的位置。
● 每名玩家擲2顆骰子，擲出數字總和最高的玩家成為起始玩家。
遊戲流程:
遊戲進行數輪，從起始玩家開始，每個人依循下列規則行動。
1.擲4顆骰，然後將骰子分為兩兩一組。
2.將暫存棋子放到遊戲盤上對應數字的那列上。
3.在擲骰後，可以決定是否進行下一次擲骰或結束這回合。
如果進行擲骰，遵照以下規則：
● 如果選擇的數字中有已經選擇過的數字，將該暫存棋子向上移動1格。
● 如果選擇的一組數字中有你還沒選擇過的數字，而且你還有能放置的暫存棋子，必須放置而不能保留。
4.當你在放置/移動暫存棋子後決定結束，用你的棋子代替暫存棋子。
接著將暫存棋子交給下一位玩家，該玩家開始他的回合。
關於放置暫存棋子(Runners)
● 如果你要放置的那列上沒有你的顏色棋子在上面，將暫存棋子放該列最底格。
(如果兩個數字一致，如7和7，將暫存棋子放在該列的第二格)
● 果你要放置的那列上已有你的顏色棋子在上面，將暫存棋子放到該顏色棋子的上方一格。
● 可以將暫存棋子放置在已有其他玩家顏色棋子的格子上。
● 擲骰後，如果你有能放置的暫存棋子，必須放置而不能保留。
爆了(Blowing it)
當玩家擲骰後，無論怎麼組合都沒有辦法放置/移動暫存棋子，表示你爆了。
移走你在遊戲盤上的暫存棋子，你並不能拿顏色棋子去取代這些暫存棋子，這是你賭錯的懲罰。
贏得一列
當你的顏色棋子(非暫存棋子)走到一列的頂端，也就是有數字的那格時，你贏得那一列。
這表示你必須是在自願結束回合，而且顏色棋子取代暫存棋子時才會發生此事。
將其他位於同一列的其他顏色棋子從遊戲盤上移走，而且以後玩家不能將暫存棋子放到該列。
遊戲結束:
當有玩家贏得三列時遊戲結束，遊戲由該玩家獲得勝利。

I don't rate it as highly as its reputation. Other people's turns are a bit too long with all the re-rolling, and whilst that can provide some pressure-fun if you ham it up, you're not getting to do anything yourself. Still, your own turns are fun, and the decisions on what to go for (ie how to split your dice up), are important and key, as well as the obvious decision on how far to press your luck which is the game's raison d'etre. It's enjoyable for the occasional romp.

Sid Sackson!!  Modern day classic!! Good push-your-luck dice game which is not Yahtzee.  The board and pieces are good.  Bulky to store in its flat square box.

With a nice balance of light strategy, luck, and quick gameplay, this is a good Family Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game.

I managed to pick it up in a charity shop and found it to be quite dissapointing, but I was playing with 4 players and I felt the game dragged waiting for your turn. You cant really spend time planning your next move! 

Have since played with only 2 players I found it a much more enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6
This is an abstract game based on pushing your luck in dice-rolling.  Basically, you're trying to roll dice combinations that you've already rolled before, particularly earlier in the turn.  You can roll as much as you like until you either stop or fail, and while any given roll isn't particularly likely to fail, it'll happen eventually.  The game is enjoyable but not particularly compelling.

I went shopping and this had a price tag that said 7,60€. I was like: "This must be cheap" and I bought it. Thought it would be a nice filler as a luck based game. So here I am, a proud owner of Can't stop.

Maybe if you are tired and almost unable to think straight or if there are non-players wanting to play something easy and quick, then you can play this.

Can't Stop was one of my husband's childhood favorites, and we felt like we won the lottery after we got a perfect old copy at a thrift store for $0.58.  This game is like gambling for people who don't like to waste money.  You feel like you're "risking it all" to move your marker up, and if you quit while you're ahead, you might be prudent or your caution could be your undoing.  It's very luck-based but it moves quickly and there's the thrill of "gambling well".

Played this on BSW. A very light push-your-luck game. It all comes down to calculating probability. The nice thing about this game is that it tells you straight what the probabilities are of rolling each different number. Played with a variant that you have to "climb over" each other. It was fun, but I won't play this again.

Being a simple dice game, suffers from downtime as you can roll often, while others watch on. Some may handle being a spectator whilst the roller takes several turns, deciding on how to split into desired numbers. Exxtra does it easier and quicker for the same effect, and the desired results can be easily anticipated, promoting the tension in a competitive mind; in Can't Stop, the probability of rolls and evaluation of risk is more involved, which may be of interest for some.

Can't stop is an ideal game for what it is. It's simple, and takes only a few minutes to learn. Anyone who can do basic math can play - so children will be able to play - but adults will happily play it without a child in sight. 

That means that, aside from being a rather fun and light game, it has great potential as a teaching tool. Over time and continued play, children may begin to discover the more complex dimensions of the game that adults are enjoying. 

Games that can bridge the age gap like that are priceless.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Rating from playing the online version only.  I'm guessing this game must "come alive" when you are playing against humans as opposed to 'bots. The game seems pretty close to Yahtzee in subgenre - it may be a bit more directly competetive, but it still is just rolling some dice and choosing what slot they go in. Really the only thing the game has is the press your luck element, and I don't find it THAT compelling. Throw in the fact that the computer invisibly gets impossible (OK, just statistically improbable) rolls frequently, and it's just frustrating more than fun. Players who really enjoy the dice-rolling and press-your-luck elements should look at Dungeon Dice for a more thematic, kid-friendly game.

8/4/10 found a copy at GW for $1.99 - I'll give it a try with the family and see if it (likely) improves during local, human play.  :)

maybe my expectations going into this game where just too high, and maybe the people i played this with were just the wrong crowd to play this game with, but in either case i was sorely disappointed by this game. it's not that can't stop is a bad game, or that there aren't any meaningful decisions to make during game play, it's more that the game is too much of a solitary activity. sure, where other players are in the game influences what decisions you make in the game, but that only amounts to rolling some dice on your turn, and just watching the other players roll dice on their turn. as far as push your luck games go, i would much rather play diamant.

Although I rate it a "7", it is one of the MOST PLAYED games in my collection. It is perfect filler, because it I easy to learn, and very entertaining to play. I frequently take it to gaming events for this reason.

As one player gets close to victory, his opponents must take more chances. The results can be dramatic.

Another aspect I appreciate: Because all components are plastic, it's resilient to food and beverage damage. You can haul it on picnics, camping trips, cookouts etc. if it gets junked up, just wipe it down with a wet rag.

If you are on the fence about getting it, rest assured. You WILL play this!

Quick, light, and loud with the right folks.  This is a fun game, although I'm glad that my copy cost 1$ at the thrift store.  Pure push-your-luck- I guess every game collection needs one of this sort.

Decent, if unexciting, little push-your-luck game - simple rules, but constant uncertainty as to whether it's worth pushing your luck or not (and with probabilities too complicated to be able to even estimate accurately at the table). Not a game I'd ever specifically ask for, but I'm rarely unhappy to play this.

RATING: 6
This game focuses on a single emotion--pressing your luck.  Everything is a possibility, if you're willing to take the risk.  Roll the dice once, twice..by the time you get up to 7 rolls you'll start getting sweaty hands.  Even towards the end of a game, when you're in last place, there's still that glimmer of hope that you can win!  I don't think there is another press-your-luck game that is this elegant.  That being said, it's a one-dimensional game, dealing with that single emotion, and the only real thinking is determining how much risk you're willing to take.  But when you're in the mood for that, this is a great game.

for a dry dice game, this one has some really, really fun push-your-luck! seeing my opponents on the board really increases the pressure behind pushing or being safe. and the strategy of whether to allow the easy things to fill quickly or save them as a safe fall-back is a longer term strategy decision i didn't expect to see in this light game. plays well with younger kids, or at lunch. my plays are all online, although i'm tempted to buy a used board and repaint the ugly thing. give it a try!

Very Accessible Light Euro 

The classic! At one time I was addicted to the online implementation Roll or Don't, playing dozens of games a day, it's so damn quick (and hard to beat the computer). I've played over 1000 times.

My wife's favorite game, bar none. For me, I like it despite myself, even though I don't want to like it. Not too much there, but no matter how much I play it seems to retain interest for me, like an itch I want to scratch. The more I scratch, the more it itches! Damn you, Sackson!

Despite my experience, I am hilariously bad at the game, and in no other game do my superstitions come out as much as here. I 'feel what the dice want me to do' and do it, most of the time. Usually, the dice want me to lose in a humiliating manner, it turns out.

RATING: 7.5
Can't Stop -- Played three- and four-player.  I've played various computer versions countless times, so I like the game's fundamental gimmick.  Playing with physical components and actual people did slow the game somewhat, but added an entirely different dimension of enthusiasm, as well as the tactile satisfaction of rolling real dice, and the involvement of doing your own math instead of letting the computer show you your options.  Quite fun.

[i]However[/i], I can only recommend this for three players.  Our four-player game bogged down once several numbers had been locked, and it seems to me the likelihood of more locked numbers is high enough with four players that I'd rather just play with three.  The game is fun and satisfying [i] as a filler[/i], and with three players that's just what it is.  With four it loses its charm.

If you like dice games with the "press-your-luck" mechanic, this is a purist's dream game. Basic rules with a simple scoring track...a stalwart classic that continues to defy an increasingly "over-engineered" world. It's biggest fault is player downtime combined with locked out numbers which prolong the game. If it got a remake, I would recommend all players rolling their own set of colored dice simultaneously to speed up the game and increase the tension of the "press your luck" mechanic.

I tend to like dice games, especially ones that require you to know some odds. I thought that might make this a good family game, but as I found through playing, the game gets tighter as the columns get closed out. This one is a sold, fun strategy game.

I was told that it was simply "Advanced Yahtzee," but it seems to be more than that.  (I suppose Yahtzee could be better with a few optional home rules.)  It's a good gateway filler.

Érdekes módon a sok kockajáték közül ez tetszett eddig a legkevésbé, ugyanis úgy érzem a kezdő játékos nagyon nagy előnyben van pl. 4 játékos esetén az utolsó játékossal szemben. Az első partiban nem sokon múlt, hogy sorra se következzen a 4. játékos, mert hamarabb vége lett volna a játéknak. Ez nálam eléggé rontott az összképen. Amúgy egy ötletes játékról van szó, 4 kockával dobás után a párban kijött összeg oszlopában lehet egyet lépni. Minden párnak a valószínűség szerint ügyesen kitalált számosságú oszlopa van. Aki ezek közül 3 számon felér az a nyertes. Azon az oszlopon, ahol már valamely játékos végigért nem lehet haladni így a negyedik játékos sorra kerülésekor előfordulhat már 3-5 kész oszlop.

Or Can't Start, in my case.  I'll get this to the table one of these days...

I used to really dislike this game, now I've pulled a 180 (or rather a 160) on this. I've really come to appreciate its simplicity and form.  After playing a number of other push your luck dice games, this game has garnered more and more respect from me.  

More importantly, it is the perfect length, which many of the new fangled dice games seem to ignore.  Really the most important thing is that, well, it's fun. While many games need to have fun people to make them work well, the joy in this game is absolutely dependent on who you are playing with.  Playing this online made me dislike it more and more, while in person it is a gem, or rather a semi-precious stone.

I should point out that for some reason the game is much more exciting if you have the big plastic stop sign.

The best press-your-luck game / dice game I have played. Just enough skill and painful decisions mixed in with the random excitement. I dropped this down a point from 10 because you tend to have to stare at the dice for a few seconds after every roll to see if you made it, which can suck out some of the tension.

Surprisingly fun for something so simple and luck-oriented.  Trash talk and body English required.  Don't settle for the mountain climbing or turtle version -- go for the stop sign!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a classic! I do OK, but sometimes I just can't stop rolling!

--- Summary ---
A simple game of push-your-luck: roll 4 dice, arrange into 2 pairs, and move those 2 mountain climbers up using temporary markers. You get to move 3 climbers each turn; once the 3 are chosen, must move at least one of them with each roll, or your turn is over and none of them advance. If you choose to stop before you fail to advance, you lock in the climbers' current positions. If you get to the top of the mountain on any path (and lock in), that line number is killed -- other climbers are knocked off, and no one may climb that line the rest of the game. The first player to lock in 3 climbers at the top wins the game!


On BSW, the dice are color coded (blue/white). If you're only using 1 pair, it's the blue pair. One minor quibble: it would be nice if the columns were numbered. However, the active dice pair is pictured at the top of each column, so it shouldn't be too confusing!

RATING: 3
Elegant push-your-luck dice game with the math clearly shining through. The board has tracks numbered 2-12, representing the possible sum of two six sided dice. On your turn, roll four dice and combine them into pairs, then  move one space on each of those tracks. You can keep rolling as long as you want, but only so long as you roll one of the first three tracks you move on in that turn -- if you don't, all progress that turn is cancelled. The tracks for more-probable numbers are longer (e.g., the 7 track is longest).

It's not entirely decision-free, because you can choose whether to play it safe, or whether to go for lower or higher probability tracks. But it's [i]almost[/i] decision-free, and the probabilities are on such naked display that you can't even delude yourself into thinking there is a game there. More players add little but downtime, too, just to nail shut the coffin. Awful, awful, awful.

RATING: 6.5
[Ravensburger 07 edition] {Dice, racing; roll-and-move, luck-pressing; optimal 4p} {Basic 6.50; Advanced 7.00} Can't Stop is a classic luck-pressing game. The use of dice is ingenious and its mechanic is novel. It is an excellent mix of luck and tactic moves.  So far, losers are usually who 'gamble' too much on moves.  Overall, it's a very fun game and is very suitable for families.

The components of the 07 edition are big enough as a family game; however, I think it is too bland and abstract. The 4 dice is pretty, with suitable transparent and nice red color tone. However, the pips wear quite fast. The 'markers' are nicely made, too - sturdy, soft color tone and color-blind friendly.

[Variant] The variant that player must continue to roll when one of the markers collide with another market is very good. It increases player interaction and tense. It should be used.

We picked this up because we thought our 5 year old daughter would enjoy the push your luck mechanic (she likes cheeky monkey) and we thought it would help with her math.

Simple, elegant, epitome of push-your-luck game. Explainable to even 6 year olds in 5 minutes, plays fast, and yet has great tension as you are constantly reminded how far you are (virtually) in respect to your nearest competitors towards that coveted column, with the catch that this only materializes when you stop. 

Does require some feel on which numbers are easier to roll (so better with older children) but this is also visualized greatly on the board.

True classic which can be played with anyone, anytime. Get yourself a copy. You won't regret it.

RATING: 5
Great little "push your luck" filler that doesn't suffer completely from the "random winner" problem like so many others (at least the decisions "feel" interesting). Great to play with kids and introduce the basics of probability. Biggest problem is downtime between turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a classic, and I love the current version with the octagonal (stop-sign shaped) board.  However, this one, to me, tends to drag, because there isn't a lot for players to do when it isn't their turn except root for the current player to 'bust'.  Maybe there's a good simultaneous variant?  We play it as a nice filler, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good: Really lets peoples' personalities show through. The feeling of "just one more roll!" is tense and exciting. Great table-talk comes about from the racing aspect.

Bad: I don't begrudge the design for the reliance on luck, but it Can't Stop me rating the game a bit lower.

RATING: 6.9
After playing Can’t Stop, I actually made my own board, using poker chips as the pyramid replacements. While I like the game, there’s no way I’d spend £30 (UK Amazon price) on owning an official copy. 

It’s easy to teach and it’s fun to see the inner gambler in everyone as they push their luck!

For what it is, Can't Stop is very good. I enjoy push your luck games more than I perhaps should. Can't Stop is my favorite example of the genre. It adds just enough strategy to increase interest. Yet it avoids adding complications that would make it overstay its welcome. In other words, Can't Stop is a clever push your luck dice game done with enough panache to make it more than the simple distraction that Pig tends to be. Sid Sackson impresses me again.

I typically play with pencil and paper sets.

Good fun. Roll dice to advance your pieces along the board, but if you push your luck too far you lose all your progress from that round.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3[/b]
With two the game is just boring, and with 4 it actually goes on too long as there is nothing at all to do when it's not your turn.

Update 10/10/2012: There's not much depth to the game and it can really drag with more than 3 players, but this is still one of the better push-your-luck games.

I love press-your-luck games and this is a great one.

Update: Moves from 7.5 to 8. I love playing and so do all the people I've played with. 8 is likely the highest I could ever rate it as it does wear out it's welcome if played too much.

Update: Back to 7.5. I have had a bit less luck with groups enjoying it lately and it would be nice if it were a 30 minute game




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.25

Can't Stop is a one trick pony with bowed tendons.

There is not a whole lot on display here.  The design is as bare as they come - so much so,  that if I had to come up with a variant - all I could think of is forcing opponents to use their right hand while rolling in one turn and their left hand while rolling in the next.

This one should appeal to anyone who gravitates towards push your luck mechanics and simply playing the odds.  While the design's basic approach may be one of it's strengths - it may also be responsible for making the game's name a true falsehood.

Classic filler. Making risk tradeoffs in trying to push your pieces as high as possible without being left with an unusable dice roll that discards your whole turn. 

I like mechanic of columns becoming won and locked which both adds urgency to get to the top before another player throws your token away, and speeds up the endgame by making rolls of that value safe(r).

Can drag on a bit with more players if people don't manage risk well enough, and the risk edges are hard enough that it can be more of a slog with 2 than I'd like.

[thing=41][/thing] might just be one of the most frustrating game I have ever played! The frustration is built in the game itself: you roll 4 dices and must use sets of them to form number from 2 to 12. In our turn you have three rows to put your markers - you decide the rows, but the choice is limited by the numbers rolled, so say you rolled 3, 5, 5 and 6 - you could chose to put your markers in the 8, 9, 10 or 11. Once you put all your three markers, the subsequential rolls will serve only to advance the marker in the said roll. You can roll the dice as many times as you wish, but, if happens that you cannot form a duo of dice that advance one of your markers, you lose all the advance you have made so far in said turn.

So your choices are limited by the dice, but also the choices must be made regarding two things: probability and the advance made by the other players. The rows for 2 and 12 are the smallest ones, and the row for the 7 is the biggest. So roll a 7 is a lot easier, but the game requires many more rolls that add to 7 than those that add to 2, 4, 10, 11 and others. Also, you know that a roll of 6, 7 or 8 is easier to get, but what if your fellow players are already well advanced in all of them? Once a player reaches the end of the row (and ends its turn while the marker is in the topmost position - this is important, as the player can continue to roll and lose the advance that would win the row for him/her) all the advancement made by the others are lost. However, having one of your three markers in the said rows, might grant you more opportunities to get the numbers you really want, as they can "save" your turn (for example, you really want a 4 or a 10, but the dice showed 2, 4, 4 and 5 - if you have a marker in the 6 or the 8 row, you could advance it and continue rolling to get the number you want).

All of this makes for some though choices - when you have then - but also for some really frustrating, well, no-choices. No amount of calculation can save you from the (bad) luck of the roll: the blind luck of someone can win a row, that you couldn't manage to win even after 4 rounds, in a single turn. Making you lose not only the row, but could also end your chances. I have games were I was well posicioned in two rows, and I lost both for players that not even started their turns with markers there. In a single round a went from a good position to win one or two rows, to having nothing, being behind everyone else in all the other rows. Sure, this can go both ways - I also won rows and games that I wasn't really invested in.

[thing=41][/thing] is a short game, but more than once I had no chance to win after the first round - and by "no chance" consider "I just couldn't stop until amazing results happened", which, sometimes, did, but many more times, don't.

I don't say it is a bad game - it isn't. [thing=41][/thing] is easy to teach, to play, have some (light) decisions to the made and you can make (and take) fun of the greed of your fellow players. I just found it a little less fun than I thought (I don't see myself playing this over [thing=37759][/thing], for instance - being a game that is also in the type of press your luck, that accommodates up to 8, with much, much less downtime, and the aspect of the fun is the same).

En este clásico de Sid Sackson, los jugadores deben presionar su suerte con los dados y elegir combinaciones tácticamente para cerrar tres columnas. La placa tiene una columna para cada posible total de dos dados de seis caras, pero el número de espacios en cada columna varía: el total más probable, las más espacios de esa columna y los más rollos que se tarda en completar. En su turno, un jugador tira cuatro dados y las presenta en dúos: 1 4 5 6 puede llegar a ser 1 + 4 y 5 + 6 durante 5 y 11, 1 + 5 y 4 + 6 para 6 y 10, o 1 + 6 y 4 + 5 para el 7 y 9. los lugares jugador o adelantos en las señales de progreso en la columna abierta (s) asociado con sus totales elegidos, a continuación, elige si para rodar de nuevo o terminar su turno y sustituir las señales de progreso con marcadores de su color. Un jugador sólo puede avanzar en tres columnas diferentes en una vuelta y no puede avanzar en una columna que cualquier jugador ha cerrado por alcanzar el espacio final; si un rollo no da lugar a ninguna jugada legal, el turno termina con el progreso que convierte perdido.
Un precursor a partir de 1974, las grandes razas, existe como un juego de lápiz y papel.

Gosh, this is one of the best dice game around! The master himself, Sid Sackson, is at his best here. The delicious decisions and the agonizing dice rolls. Do I stop and take the points or do I keep pushing for that one more dice roll. Greed is not always good. Nothing like needing one more square to win the game and not having what you need to achieve that score. Definitely a must keep! Sackson is a genius.

060612: still a good dice game but with the wrong crowd, it can get boring really quick. Downgrade a few notches.

I finally got a chance to play this due to a friend's $0.25 thrift store find.  I had read the rules before, but I frankly just did not get it without having the pieces in front of me.

I recently got Cloud 9, and I can't miss the similar feel of these games.  In both games, you are banking your progress on chance, but Can't Stop is a little more strategic, and Cloud 9 feels more social.  I found the strategy surprising in a game so dominated by die.  Making a four die roll into pairs really lets you play with the odds.  You can use progression on two high probability tracks to mitigate the odds on faster lower probability tracks.  When columns get blocked, things become much more tense, and luck dominates more.

It does end up being pretty dry.  We played on the stop sign version, and unfortunately, that level of red is a bit too much for me.  If I wasn't aware of the game's reputation, I would have had a very hard time taking this game seriously.  Is there a perfect version of this game?  I've seen the pictures of the more attractive mountain version, but the Parker Bros version has the nice pieces that interlock and fit into the stop sign board.  It would be great if someone would produce a nice classy wooden version!

This game, more than any other push-your-luck game I've played, gets me really tense. Should I pick the 7 and 9 or the 5 and 11? Should I roll again? If I stop now will the other players get too far ahead for me to win? I love it.

Must-have for 6-10 year-olds!

My favorite push-your-luck game. Clever, simple design, easy rules, and lots of fun. I consider this to be a must-have board game for all gamers. 

Can't Stop may be the oldest game besides chess that I own (I got rid of my childhood games of Monopoly, Life, and Risk long ago), and the only one besides SET and Survive that are over 25 years old. This classic Parker Brothers game, designed by the most famous American board game author, Sid Sackson, somehow never became super-popular at the time, as it really should have. Luckily, it has recently been re-released by Gryphon games. Get the new Gryphon version, not a vintage version, because the new version has improvements, such as playing pieces being cute traffic cone shapes, and spaces in the corners to store your pieces. 

Sid Sackson also authored a book with the rules for a large collection of interesting, simple games, called "A Gamut of Games," and it's worth getting:

Fine, but a little too light to be anything that I'd consider buying.  Good for kids or people who simply aren't interested in anything beyond something that fits the archetypes of boardgaming that they are familiar with.  Simple rules make it easy to teach.  Kind of fits in that [gameid=45] niche that is a combination of just a smidge too light and a smidge too long to be worth the effort for my taste.

Fun, addictive filler.  Like Bluff, it's a dice game with only a smidgen of luck thrown into the mix.  Since you're wanting to play the odds, it's usually easy to guess when to stop pressing your luck.  While the computer game is shorter, it lacks the taunting and trash talk that makes the game fun as a social event.

There is a board with all the possible results of two six-sided dice: two through twelve. The object of the game is to move a little marker to the top of three columns by rolling that result, but you need many more sevens than you need twelves, based on the likelihood of each result. During your turn, you roll the dice and place temporary markers onto the board. You can continue moving these markers until either none of your dice match (your turn is over and all progress you've made is gone), or cut your losses and end your turn (placing a permanent marker in your rows). Nice light filler for opening or closing a session.

Normally I would never describe a game as perfect but this may be the best causal board game I've ever played. Also one of the best press your luck games I've ever played. It scales well and it's fun watching people play it especially if they have gotten really far and you know the next roll will either decide their success or failure. While I do say it is perfect there is a minor complaint I have component wise with the dice and that's they feel like generic ones you would have found with the original Parker Brothers release. I wish they would use translucent red dice like you'd find at a craps table because while this isn't a gambling game it does have that feel and those dice would suit the game better imho. Overall this is my favorite Sid Sackson game because it is so simple and elegant. Can't recommend this enough especially if you like light dice games.

I am not a betting person but I do like games with a betting element, probably because of schadenfreude or just because of the suspenseful element. I don't know. I also don't know why I like dice-rolling games, maybe it's because they have a nostalgia factor since most of the games I played as a child required die. This game combines those two elements. It is super easy to learn and play, and is not too long. Perfect for what it is.

Purchased 17.07.07. This is an easy to teach 30 min filler. I love these push your luck type games. Although I've only owned this game a short time, I've played it many many times on BSW, so it was a must buy when the reprint appeared.

Played a few times face-to-face, and a lot on BSW. A simple idea turned into a great push-your-luck game. It is random, but not that random, and short enough so that it does not matter that much. Played face-to-face, the game is much longer, but the commenting and taunting can make it worth playing occasionally.

So far, all plays were vs. the "Roll or Don't" AI, so they aren't logged.

But wow, this thing is addictive! I usually hate dice games, but this one is a blast.

UPDATE: After more games, well, I'm getting annoyed with it like I do with all dice games. Lowering the rating.

Based on the description, I didn't expect to like this game. When I finally tried it, I found it engaging and a lot of fun. It's a great filler, lots of fun to debate pushing your luck or egging on your opponenets to push theirs.

RATING: 7
A suprising amount of fun and tension from a light weight, luck driven game. It is a little long for a filler but exciting and worth playing. 

Update: This comes out more than I would have thought. I went from a 7 to a 7.5 because I just like playing it more than its nature should warrant.

Back down to a 7 because it can take long with the wrong people or on a bad game.

RATING: 5
A classic that I only played once. Was a bit disappointed, because I love push-your-luck games, but this one fell flat to me. Once the numbers are locked in, each roll has the same odds of success, which feels weird.

RATING: 8
Easy to learn and surprisingly fun.

My wife and I have "rediscovered" this game. We found out that we had been playing wrong. Even wrong we liked it, but right it is much more balanced and real tough choices whether to stop or keep rolling.

The mistake was that we thought you had to be able to place both pairs of dice. In reality you only have to place one marker (if you can only place one) to stay in play for the turn. If you can place both markers then you must. Hence our confusion.

Fast, fun filler that probably deserves a 6 rating based on my personal enjoyment.  I bump this up a notch because it's a rare game that works for kids and adults together, and the components are pretty much weatherproof so it's a good choice for those who want to game outdoors.

I think I remember seeing a copy of this game in the house years ago.  Perhaps one of my siblings had it?  I never played it then, and don't recall ever seeing it played, but recognized the board at a game store I frequent now.  

It's actually a decent game of chance.  And stopping is for pussies.

Classic press your luck game.

This game has just enough luck to not feel that you are being dominated by the dice.  It also plays quickly so you could always start another game after the first.

An excellent push your luck dice game. Yes, indeed there is a lot of luck via the die rolls, but there's also a lot of player control and risk management to contend with. Vying for progress along the various tracks is interesting, and makes for a nice blend of tactical and strategic decisions. I far prefer this with only 2 players, as opposed to 3 or 4. The BrettSpielWelt online implentation is wonderful, and plays very quickly.

As you'd expect with a game purely about dice rolling, it all comes down to luck.  Yes it's possible to calculate probabilities and expectations, but the small number of results needed to make massive gains mean that regression to the mean doesn't have a chance to take effect.

Alright as a five minute filler, but that's about it.

I love how you can choose your lanes out of the dice you rolled. Sometimes deliberately voiding one set in the hope that the next set of rolls will be more to your advantage.

The mountain theme is the best, but the cloth board is a turn off.

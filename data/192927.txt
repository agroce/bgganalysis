A weird beast. I've only played the first scenarios. Choosing the "murderer" role I largely watched the others play and then performed one single action to end the game immediately. 

I like the idea, but the game drags out for too long for what it is. I've seen the expansion stirring things up with a turn timer - this could make the game a lot more interesting.

Fun hidden movement game, back and forth is cool. The second Chapter is kinda... pointless.. give the Killer a token... that allows him to hide one turn... I guess that could be helpful.... but chapter 2 adds time to the game unnecessarily IMO

Hide and seek with a masked maniac? What's not to love? OK, well the rulebook isn't the greatest and the game really takes two or three full plays to really coalesce. Once all the ingredients have finally transformed into a blood red gelatinous goo, the game reaches it's maximum potential. One of the best in the genre for sure.

Very cool game.  Not knowing how the four game sections worked I did not have a good game as the killer but I'm looking forward to a second time.  I love the theme.

1 vs many hidden movement game played at Gen Con. We didn't get to play the final chapter, but the first 3 were fun. In particular, the third chapter was much better than the first two, which almost seemed like tutorials. The theme tied in perfectly to the game, again in particular, the third chapter where the game could be over very quickly (unlike the first two). Definitely would like to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not my top pick for theme out of the box, but very well-executed (no pun intended). Nice looking board with network of paths around camp, even into an exciting looking but clearly bottlenecked cemetery. Two plays, and the maniac is growing more intelligent.

I admit that I played this game once.  We played through all 4 acts and we all came away with the same opinion. The game needs to be house ruled to be more fun.  It was  too difficult to  catch the maniac as he would just run away only to come back in the next act.  I agree that is thematic and we did have him blocked in for a short period of time but there are just too many ways for him to get away. I think the game would benefit from a smaller board or a better way to follow bread crumbs to catch him or the maniac has to reveal his position more.  We enjoyed act one where we scrambled to the cabins and we enjoyed Act 3 where he slaughtered most of us except the "pre-destined" savior camper.  Lastly, in Act 4 the pre-destined is the only one that can kill him which seems really quite difficult.  Too difficult. 
I have played Specter Ops and Fury of Dracula and I personally think those games  do what this game does except better.  By Act 4 the game just dragged on and we asked the maniac are we anywhere near you on round 12.  Based on that we realized we could never catch him so we ended the game early.  Not only could we not move our pieces to be close to him but only the pre-destined could kill the maniac and they were even further away.  There just was very little tension in last act.  I think the game would be better if it copied the Friday the 13th video game on the PS4 where the campers have to get items to start a car or boat to get away.  
I also do not like the fact that there is typically no way to fight against the maniac in several acts.  If he crosses your path....you're dead.  That's it.  Maybe if we had a baseball bat to hurt the maniac.   The game fell flat for us which is a shame because we really adore the slasher theme.  We know it could be more fun with house rules but why fix the game when we can play Fury of Dracula. This seemed like a at times exciting and at times boring game of hide and seek.

In conclusion: maybe a smaller map or a better bread crumb trail to find the maniac.  The game could also use something better than wooden pawns.  A figure of a maniac with a machete would have been cool.

RATING: 8
Played another couple times, with a well-prepped Manaic, and it was a lot more fun. Definitely have your Maniac player grab and read the rules ahead of time for best results; their position is not necessarily difficult but iis tricky - you've got to use the axe, double-move, and place the tent chips with some care.

I don't know if this will have a ton of replayability, but I've been enjoying it. The full arc is clearly the best way to do it, which will take between 90 minutes and two hours after the first play. The second-best way seems to be to skip right to Act III and IV, which should be 90 minutes or so. For a starter game, just do Act I & II.
---
Played twice, thought the game had a lot of potential, but not sure if I *quite* enjoyed. Potentially tough on the Maniac. The first scenario is really important and I'd recommend playing it once as a standalone to get a feel for the game before committing to the campaign. The Maniac needs to play fairly carefully the first day: place the tents & keys with some care (place keys far away from matching tents), break open a cabin strategically with the axe, then really go for the jugular and remember it may be wise to spend the last couple moves putting some distance between yourself and the campers if you're not going to get a critical kill. If the Maniac doesn't kill at least 2 campers in the first scenario, the second scenario is not going to be that interesting. This should not be too hard if you're plotting, but if you play Last Friday as a light game and don't put in the thought, it may be elusive. One of the things I like about this is that it's fast and seems super-tight; everything you do matters, there is no filler. Anyway, if scenario 1 is a bust, just reset and let the Maniac have another go rather than continuing with a campaign that probably won't be that compelling.

Fun theme for campy horror movie fans. Like the asymmetrical characters and the back-and-forth between the campers and Jason but the game just ran way too long for it's simplicity. I also feel like it's much harder to win as the campers. Need to try it again to confirm though. Needs 6 players to be at its best.

I usually love hidden movement and deduction games, but this seems too long and fiddly for what it is. The give and take of the chase is a good idea in theory, but it seems like this really always wants to be played in all five parts, and I found myself not wanting to bother, the times I've played it.

I was not a fan of the game components.  The artwork on the player cards was weird.  I almost wish they went the Flying Frog route and used photos instead.  The player markers were too stylized.

[26 Feb 2018] - 6 (1 play)
I wanted to love this game based on the theme but my first game play left me unsatisfied. First, you need players and lots of them to play. The game doesn't scale to player count but rather players are expected to just play multiple characters. If you get beyond that or get a group together, the first act can be a lot of fun. That's about where it ends.

The game then puts you through 3 more acts that roughly follow the Friday the 13th part 1 - 5. One act the staff fight back. Then there's an act where one of the staff is now the chosen one with the killer. Since each act is mostly moving around the board with the killer hidden, they start to feel stale. By the last act, you've been doing the same thing for 2 hours and it's dull. To make matters worse, the last act can only be won by the player who has the chosen one. This basically makes the rest of the table worthless bystanders in the process. 

If the killer happens to stumble upon your character in the game, you're out of the round. This means you can sit there for 20-30 minutes of watching other people play the game, offering up suggestions, going to the bathroom - just about everything except for playing the game. In act 3, I guessed right and moved right into the killer to reveal their location. I helped my team but also bored myself in the process.

The production of the art and the components was great. Had a better game been in the box I would have given it a much higher rating.

Last Friday copy from GenCon 2016 with Buby character card promo.

Initial play: 7. May be a bit long, but that also may be because we had to iron out some rules, and get everyone on the same page. I'm sure playing with experienced player will expedite the gameplay. There also may be a balance issue with the game, but that's probably me saying that because I lost as the maniac. Will update soon after 3 or more plays.

Letters to Whitechaple(hidden movement) meets Friday the 13th (the killer is hidden). Play time is 45 minutes a chapter with 4 chapters being the full game so full game is 3 hours so I recommend just playing 2 chapters as it will really overstay it's welcome. There are also some movement issues for dead characters, it would have been nicer just to say they where eliminated then have them do useless busywork thinking they can get back into it :P

While it may not have the extravagance or the epic feeling of Fury of Dracula, Last Friday is my favourite hidden movement game by far. The idea of switching the rolls is just genius and it really does feel like you are playing through a horror movie.

I had really high hopes for this game, but it was kind of a let down.  The theme is really interesting and I like the way the roles of the slasher and campers flip-flop each chapter, but overall the game feels unpolished.  Chapter 1 is a bit boring and chasing a specific character across the map is wearisome at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If you have someone really read the rules and understand what's going on this game is a freaking blast. Chapters move smoothly and there isn't a whole lot of rule checking. If you just try to dive into this you are gonna have a bad time m'kay. The whole hide and seek mechanic is brilliant and sparks adrenaline for both the killer and all the campers. Definitely worth picking up, especially if you are a fan of slasher films/hidden movement games. I love this one, 7.5/10!

I have a hard time fathoming playing this over Fury of Dracula or Letters from Whitechapel. Both have the 1vmany hidden movement, and while this alternated who was chasing who, it didn't really feel like there were meaningful choices here. I'd maybe play it two players, but with the full 6, it felt like people didn't really even need to take their turns and could have just agreed on a game plan before each round and have one person execute the turns. I didn't really feel the theme at all either (except when it came to digging up the bodies), which is super disappointing because I am definitely a theme person.

Last Friday is an interesting hidden movement game with a twist. Each scenario either has the maniac hunt survivors or survivors hunt the maniac. This causes some issues when the manic kills someone as they are out of the round. If playing all scenarios the game overstays its welcome. Overall it's somewhat enjoyable like most hidden location game and a decent option for big fans of the genre. Overall I'd say Letters from Whitechapel remains best option.

I really, really wanted to like this game. It's bad. I was bored, the group was bored and the game plodded along. Movement of the campers and maniac is slow. Glacially slow, and weighted in favor of the maniac in all phases of the game. And, even if your camper survives the first phase but doesn't make it into a cabin, well, you're dead anyhow, which completely unbalances the second phase. And so on and so on until, mercifully, it's over.  if you want good hidden movement get Letters of Whitechapel, Fury of Dracula or Specter Ops. This game deserves an machete to the middle of the box.

The biggest problem of this game is: when it comes to the end of a round, you know that you will be the one who is escaping, instead of chasing, so you won't be fighting till your last strength to chase the villian. That makes the game really hard to reach a climax.

Fun, but the game balance really hurts the game since it's heavy in favor of the campers, playing the maniac just isn't that fun cause of that.

One of the best of implementations of the hidden movement mechanic. The game is rich with theme, aping the many teen slasher movies, with a maniac stalking a bunch of teen campers in the woods. Like the movies, the game is in four 'acts' but the gaming twist is that in the second and fourth acts, the tables are turned and it is the campers that are trying to catch the killer.

Loved the idea of changing sides during the acts of the game, but unfortunately it get's too long and is not exciting enough. Regarding one vs. many games with hidden movement I'd rather play Specter Ops (on the more casual end) or Fury of Dracula (on the heavier end).

I only got to play night 1 but man am I so excited to play the rest of the game. It is crazy! First the hunter is after the campers then the camper is after the hunter it is all sorta of twists and turns and I really like the game play. The lake is a nice feature too. Very excited for this one.

RATING: 4
A one versus many hidden-movement game, with the one effectively being Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. The four chapters have alternating objectives which give a differing feel to each, although our game ended early in Chapter 3 as the Maniac put on his trainers to run through a cabin and kill the Predestined. Up to that point, the Campers had been way ahead - no deaths in Chapter 1, cornered and caught the Maniac in Chapter 2 - so it was a bit of an "Is that it?" ending. Certainly engaging for the Maniac player, akin to Spectre Ops; less so for the campers, one in particular. Unlucky for some.

I think this game is going to largely depend on your group.  If you can get lost in the theme, you'll probably really like this.  If you are going to constantly get hung up on min-maxing, you probably won't like this.

As a big fan of Euro mechanisms, this one missed the mark for me.  Having said that, I look forward to playing this every Halloween with a few beers.

"Last Friday" was a blast for my gaming group! There is always the one of us who wants to take the role of the evil one who is against all other players. He considers this hidden movement game as one of the better ones in this genre (compared to its more heavy weighted relatives "Fury of Dracula" or "Letters from Whitechapel"). To be honest: I think it has some slight disadvantages. First the game feels scripted in a certain way. And although the theme is strong and really lovely implemented there are some things that are rather boring. For example: some of the teens/campers often simply run around without big sense. But all in all it is a good game and your group should play all four chapters in a row and in one session (should take about two hours).

Очередная продвинутая версия старого доброго "Скотланд Ярда". Ближе даже наверное к Letters from Whiteсhapel, по механике хождения убегающего и ловящего. Партия в LF это такие 4 партии в "Скотланд Ярд", объединённые в одной, сдобренные знаковой атмосферой известного "ужастика". Принцип данной игры интересен ещё и тем, что роли в 4-ёх частях (называемых в игре Главами) одной партии у двух сторон разные, вернее они ими меняются. Два раза одна сторона ловит, другая прячется, а два раза наоборот. Немного разнообразят процесс небольшие бонусы каждой из сторон в виде жетонов. Интересен сюжет сценариев. А в общем то всё тот же "Скотланд Ярд", "Мистер Х", "Ghost Chase in Canterville Castle" и конечно же, та самая Letters from Whiteсhapel.

Hands down my most disappointing game of 2016.

I love the theme and I think it could be well implemented in this type of game.

However, "The Last Friday" is awful. It's a slow game. Not in the time it takes to actually play, but mechanically. Only being able to move  TWO spots on a board littered with more than 200 is intolerable. You move your camper, plodding and slow, over to a token, hope the killer doesn't cross your path, hope the token is something useful. It's utterly random and boring. There is no strategy here.

Playing the killer isn't any better. You still move painfully slowly, in a sad attempt to cross paths with a camper. That's all you have to do. That's all there is to do.

Playing the "full" game attempts to make things slightly more interesting. Instead of just campers escaping the killer, the game arbitrarily changes, giving the campers a chance at revenge. Now, they slowly stumble towards the killer instead of away from it. It's the same plodding gameplay as before. It's almost as if the designers knew the game was terribly boring and attempted to mix things up in the laziest way possible.

This game is wretched.

Very cool hidden movement.  Amazing board; player components are flimsy(needed to be upgraded to thicker cardboard ala Last Night on Earth or at least Arkham Horror).  The rounds where the killer is stalking the campers are great.  The reverse rounds are not.  Feels like it needed a little more development to keep the excitement the whole way through.  The finale feels like a letdown.  A second edition or expansion will hopefully fix the issues.

I regret buying this game.  I like the theme of 80s horror, but execution is lacking.  Characters are bland and similar.  Hidden movement along with changing roles make for a game that is, not only unbalanced, but awkward and uninteresting.

Great fun hack 'n slash themed game with switching objectives for each chapter. The board looks great, the theme pours through constantly, and there's a lot of fun to be had from either role. Great game.

You probably want to create house rules for this game. We did since we found the regular rules missing that certain something. Here's our change of the rules:

Round 1 -- Have the Maniac move TWICE per turn. YES, You will kill more campers this way, but who watches a 1980's killer movie and nobody dies? The Maniac can NOT put the keys for the cabins the farthest point away from the cabins. ALSO - you may choose to add new campers during gameplay if any die (we did and it just meant we do all 15 moves. You can choose not to allow dead players to come back until round 2 but then you have people NOT playing the game and that's boring for them.) Be sure to add those CLUES for the campers to use later. We also allowed campers to keep their clues after they died.
Round 2 -- The Maniac now moves only one space - the campers can catch him if they have helpful clues.
Round 3 -- Give the Maniac the ability to jump 2 again BUT DO NOT REVEAL the "Predestined". The maniac will only choose to chase the predestined and the other players will be bored. The campers should run away but not too far away for the Predestined will want to stay close to the Maniac when the round is over to kill him during round 4.
Round 4 - Keep the same.

It's not a good game. It's almost a good game, but suffers from too many flaws. It's not worth $39.99 or whatever MSRP is, but it's worth $19.99 even if you only play it around Halloween or something.

The way it handles hidden movement is really well done. The dedication to capturing the feeling of a Friday The 13th movie is very palpable, with a lot of fun little details and special powers that make it fun. The maniac can pull classic horror movie trope moves that mess with the campers, but the campers have special tools they can use to reveal the maniac's location.

However, the biggest issue is that they broke the whole thing into four chapters, that alternate maniac hunting campers, and campers hunting maniac. This would be fine, except the game is meant to be played all four chapters sequentially, and each chapter begins where the last chapter left off, with all of your pawns in the exact same place. So it's kind of like the Haunts in Betrayal At House On The Hill; it's very likely that you will end up in a position where one side is very overpowered and the other side almost CAN'T win that scenario.

The other issue is that playing all 4 chapters is way too long, so they break up the four chapters so that in theory, you could play them each as an individual game (each chapter has unique rules to it). But the chapters are so damn short that they're unsatisfying alone.

Like I said. Almost a good game. We honestly had a blast for the first two chapters, and all agreed the game didn't deserve the negative press. But by the end of the fourth chapter, we were all ready to be done with it and went "Okay yeah I get it now."

Demoed this during GenCon 2016 and pre-ordered it before we left Indy.

I've been looking for the right hidden movement game for the better part of a year and I believe this is it. The map looks fantastic, the chapter based gameplay is a stroke of genius, and the mechanic where the manias has to announce where he was three turns ago does such a fantastic job of giving players the eerie feeling that the killer could be anywhere...even RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

So pumped for this to arrive some day. :S

Veloce da spiegare e immediato da giocare. Last Friday riesce sempre a far immergere i giocatori nella partita, avvinghiando l tavolo di gioco con una morsa di ansia palpabile. Il suo regolamento semplicissimo lo rende perfetto per essere giocato in famiglia e con le persone non troppo avvezze ai GdT più complessi, riuscendo sempre a fare centro.

Of the deduction games I've played like Letters from Whitechapel, Specter Ops and Fury of Dracula, I enjoyed this the least. The chapters feel wooden and give the game an uneven experience. Though this isn't longer than all of the aforementioned games, I do think it overstays its welcome. For similar deduction I would recommend Letters from Whitechapel. For similar theme, I'd recommend Psycho Raiders.

Ok, hidden movement game with interisting, alternating hunter~hunted over four chapters which play somewhat differently. But far too long - at least with 5 new players analysing and discussing everything.

Being chased through the woods by an axe-wielding maniac is not really the time for calm, thorough, slow analysis of all your options - should be fast and frantic, and then maybe a better/good game.

Better with fewer players? Better if played quickly with no or strictly limited time for analysis and discussions?

Yes, much better played fairly quickly.

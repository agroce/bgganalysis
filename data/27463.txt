An interesting game which seems not really completely balanced, but I need more plays to try different strategies. I think it is quite good, but of course not as good as its bigger brother TI3.

Tipo 4x las navecitas son una pasada, me molan mil. El juego en sí es un 4x auténtico con turnos de elegir acciones tipo puerto rico, pero expandiendo el mapa, expandiendo influencias, luchando con dados entre naves y bases para arrebatar influencia, etc. Por esto último depende mucho de la suerte, sistema de lucha demasiado simplón, entra el factor alianza o no con otro jugador etc. 1 partida a 3 jugdaores, mejor probar otras con más jugadores, ya que el juego se me hizo corto y se acabó cuando empezaba a dar frutos mis estrategias con las acciones.

RATING: 8
Only played twice but I definitely enjoyed how all the various elements of roles, influence, economy and combat all came together smoothly.  A very respectable game so far.  It didn't get bogged down anywhere which is where many other games of this type fail. 

I need to play this some more to cement my opinion, but if I am honest, as I really wanted to like this game, I think this ends up being a little fluffy for my tastes.  While I appreciate a "euro" style space game, I can't help feeling shortchanged a bit.  I would prefer more dynamic combat elements to truly get into this.  In fact I am working on a euro/ameritrash hybrid to fill this huge void in the genre.  Collaborators welcome.  

Having said all that, this game is in fact a big inspiration to me and a step forward for the genre.  As such I won't downgrade my rating.

Este juego me recordó en un principio al Nexus Ops, con el que comparte muchos puntos en común. O sea, guerra entre los jugadores. Sin embargo este va u npoco más allá e incluye selección de roles tipo Puerto Rico, así como gestión de recursos y colocación de losetas, lo que le da orto aire al juego. No es nada repetitivo y se crean interesantes partidas, un juego al que me gustaría repetir. Mejor a mayor número de jugadores.

'Twilight imperium lite', still good fun, but if you've got a little more time and money go for TI.
And as with nearly every game ever, lots of dice rolling for combat, and hard to pull back if you start losing.

RATING: 6.3
A game I thought would be "Twilight Imperium Light" and it was, but too light.  It had the same feeling as most euro's where as soon as the fun gets started, the game ends.  The decisions are pretty straight forward and there is a little bit of space combat, but, in general, the game is such a lightened form of Twilight Imperium that all I see in it are the missing aspects of a game I love.

RATING: 4
A nice attempt at making a "Puerto Rico" version of Twilight Imperium. Hosing the leader is too powerful, and the game is not epic-feeling enough. The roles have too specific purposes and their selection is the most formulaic I've yet encountered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not bad, but once you're behind in the victory point count then it is pretty much impossible to catch up. There is only one way to get them (apart from 1 here and there for having a full storage area etc) and that is by controlling planets when the regent is chosen. This is very limiting, having more paths to getting VPs would make the game far better.

Plays like Puerto Rico with military, or a light version of Twilight Imperium.  I thought it was pretty well done, though I think a few things could've been tweaked.

9/4/2017: I think that the stated playing time of 90 minutes is low, maybe just with new players.  With Eclipse out, this just isn't hitting the table anymore.  Sold at Guardian Games Labor Day Yard Sale.

9/5/2009: Not a Euro.  I think that this does a good job of scratching that wargame itch.  To me I think that sometimes it feels a little unbalanced, but hey it's a wargame, and unlike TI3, you don't have to set aside a whole day to play it.  Went over well with my group (5 players).  I think that 4 might be the sweet spot.

Starbases and empire sectors have strong defenses.  I don't think that aggression is rewarded as richly as it is in TI3.

some nice ideas, a focused try to make an ti3 game quick. could be quite good, but has 2 serious problems - turn order can easily make someone move last the entire game, and the regent provides just to insane a chance for people to simply take someone out of the game at almost no cost to them.

11/11/08 - A couple of playings in now and I've enjoyed my games.   I enjoy the role selection aspect of the game and how, generally, the game progresses from an exploration/research game into a more war based game.   My two playings were very different though.   The first followed the prescibed route of exploration, then war, whereas my second game ended up being explore once, then fight over those planets for an hour, explore, fight and over three hours later end the game.   Still enjoyable, just not as quite enjoyable.  I need to see if I can still go research/explore early while others are trying to kill me or will the game just be slowed.

RATING: 6.4
When reading the rules it seems a sort of light TWI. When playing it is certainly deeper than imagined and the game has got a lot going for it. Even though there is absolutely nothing new in this game the overal experience is rather fresh and challenging. Playing time on the box seems a joke. Count on at least 45 minutes per player.

Playing time issues follow from the fact that the designer (and playtesters) found it obvious Regent was chosen (nearly) every turn. From my experience this does not happen with games with les than 6 players. There seem to be better ways to improve ones position relative to the others than picking Regent. Minor design flaw.

 Game did not speed up when playing the second time.Playing time might be a serious downside to this game. 

Traded away as I had no desire to get this to the table anymore.

Far too long for what it is, and what it is isn't very creative, but plays well anyway.  Time would probably reduce with several plays and all players experienced, but would rather play both Nexus Ops & Puerto Rico in the time it takes to play this.  Rather upset by the laziness of the rules design, even if it flows fairly well.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. As a europhile the hex board and plastic starships gave me cause for concern (I clung on to the cubes for reassurance), however it seems this is Puerto Rico in space. A little less finely balanced than PR perhaps, but with added Ameritrash space battles - and actually all the better for that.

There is no question that the game was inspired by San Juan and Puerto Rico.  Evident with the Role Card selection mechanics.  But apart from that the game can stand on its own as a very satisfying space empire building game.  The rulebook could've been made clearer though by including more graphical examples.

Twilight Imperium lite. Plays a lot faster and is as much fun, I am told! You can't go wrong then can you? I've now played Ti3 as well and we now kinda have a full fat and a lite version - both good for the right occasion.

Could never sit still for a full game of Twilight Imperium, but want to play Twilight Imperium... this seems to work for me.

RATING: 9
This game has been variously referred to as "Puerto Rico in space" or "TI III lite." Both monikers have some merit although I think GE is closer to TI III than simply a lite version. While TI III is truly an "epic" experience and there is a place for that, GE has enough of the space opera elements going for it to scratch that itch for me in a much shorter time frame. Both have their own distinct character and depth. I like and will happily play either game as worthy entries in the "space opera" genre, but I accept that there may be a different appeal depending on the tastes of your group.
++++++
Update: The game has not "caught on" as I had expected/hoped. The ratings have remained far lower than this game deserves. Maybe people are expecting it to be more like TI-III yet boiled down and quicker to play. Recipe for disappointment? But, it has stood up well with us and is a better game than is reflected by the ratings here.
++++++
Further Update: And then, of course, along came "Eclipse!" So now there is truly a "TI-III lite" and as a result we've not seen GE hit the table for some time now (but the fact that they share the same ship sculpts is a constant reminder). I still have fond memories of it and will see about getting it back on the table and perhaps re-evaluate as Eclipse, while a lot shorter than TI-III, is still a fairly long game. GE still could scratch that itch in a nicely playable time-frame especially if you are five or six players. 
++++++
And finally back on the table it came! With all six players - and I was impressed that it has held up really well. The "role" tiles separate it from Eclipse and reminds us of its Puerto Rico antecedents. This game remains under-rated in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice boiled down Twilight Imperium that you can play in 2 to 3 hours. Well, its a compromise, but a good one.
Also shares the downside with Twilight Imperium: It becomes hard if the other players band against you, and once you are weak everybody tries to grab a piece of the cake. There is no full player elimination, but when you are left with just your home planet, you can't do much anymore, unless you are an extremly capable politician.

TI3 light, with the role-choosing mechanism of Puerto Rico and spacetiles similar to Settlers of Catan. Seems to be an interesting mix of an eurogame and ameritrash. By now I love the tiebreaker, a Big Final Battle.
Edit: This game works fine.
High Interaction here due the role picking mechanism of PR combined with quick and dirty space fights.
The game runs fine and smooth. A really good AT/Euro-Mix. Game length of 2 -3 hours is the sweet spot for such a game. Also are the components for a first publication very good.

I owned Galactic Emperor for roughly 5 years before trading it.  I never played it.  The rules overhead was a significant reason for this.  The rules themselves are not overly complicated, but it was difficult to figure out how everything worked together.  This is a game that needs at least one and maybe several plays before you can really play it, and I didn't have the patience.

Some good ideas here (most of them borrowed) that are spoiled by the bad ones. The game is short which might be nice, but it never reaches enough conflict.

RATING: 5
Ein vielversprechender Titel... bis zum ersten Spiel.

Eingeschränkte sinnvolle Politik da jeder Spieler maximal 3 Politische Counter / Regentenphase setzen kann.

Dümmliche Territorialkontrolle da jemand in der Regentenphase einer eigenen Flotte das System unterm Hintern abnehmen kann und die eigene Flotte sich dann aus dem vormals eigenem System zurück ziehen muss.

Unausgewogene Rollenkarten:

Forschung - 1 Technologie ohne Baum ermäßigung... hübsch sich gleich in der ersten Runde eine fortgeschrittene Technologie kaufen zu können...

Konstruktion - 1 Fighter gratis... Klasse, eine Resource nach Wahl wäre praktischer

Regent -sehr mächtig. Da man als letzter seinen eh auf 3 limitierten Einfluss legen kann und jemandem ein System untern hinter abnehmen kann. Raumstationen bieten mit ihrem Verteidigungswert von 2 keinerlei Schutz. Einfluss Marker können überall gelegt werden, egal ob angrenzend am eigenen Territorium oder nicht.


Händler - Keinerlei Einfluss auf den Markt. Man würfelt zwar , durch die Festlegung welche Wertigkeit wo gelegt werden muss kann man es auch fast schon gleich lassen.

Explorer - mächtig da man als einziger gleich ein System in sein Imperium eingliedern darf während alle anderen nur legen dürfen

Warlord - die Karte ist ein Witz. Einmalig +1 Angriffswürfel

Fazit: Nett gemeintes jedoch schlecht konzeptioniertes 4X Spiel. Da sollte man lieber 2 -3 Stündchen dran hängen und TI3 spielen.

RATING: 5
I'm pretty sure the sweet spot is 5. My opinion of the game is declining; it's just too fragile and not good enough even under the best situation. I'll take Conquest of Paradise or Risk.
---
Tough game to rate. I had fun with it, but honestly, I don't think the game actually works all that well. The combat and production systems are fun, but the Regent role is a little tricky and many techs appear mis-costed. On the plus side, the combination of the warehousing limits, countermix limits, and the incremental scoring (every time the Regent is chosen instead of only at the end of the game) seem to nicely prevent runaway leaders and allow for game-long position jockeying instead of the last-turn slugfest. On the bad side, the game critically depends on players self-balancing, i.e., using the freedom the game gives them to check leaders and keep the game close instead of randomly beating on people or picking on convenient people instead of people who are actually winning. Also on the bad side, the roles do not seem well-balanced; the Warlord's advantage is so tiny and the downside of having to move first sometimes rather significant, that it seems like a role you always want someone else to pick, but if nobody picks it, the game loses its main charm, the mixup of space combat; if we aren't shooting each other, why aren't we just playing Puerto Rico?

The game does feel very derivative (and I've never played TI3), but I think the warehouse limits are clever and useful enough to allow the game to escape being damned as a knock-off. And the combat system is nice and works well in the context of the game.

Anyway. This is a game you have to go into knowing what to expect and what you want. This isn't Puerto Rico in space; this is Risk with an interesting economic system and a souped-up combat system. It's a light-ish, not very serious, whack-your-neighbor game. If you're expecting more than that, you'll likely be disappointed. As for my part, I had fun with it. It works far better than competing games like Antike or Nexus Ops; that is to say, it moves along at a reasonable clip, and it fundamentally works even if superficial details are too often out-of-whack. I have to think, though, that I would generally pick Conquest of Paradise if given the choice.

The game supports 3-6 players, but I'm pretty sure you want to avoid the extremes. There is a sweet spot in there somewhere, I'm guessing at 4 or maybe 5. Game length is key. This is a 90-120 minute game. More than that, and I think it would drag. I played in about that time with 5, but with 6 I've heard reliable reports of 3 hours, which I think is too long.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 6 players: Plays a lot like a trimmed down version of Twilight Imperium. I dig that it has a lot of the same TI flavor (in terms of mechanics, not lore) but with a nice 1.5-2 hour playing time. That said, not a lot really grabbed me about this. A lot of the time I just felt like I would rather be playing Nexus Ops. The combat is pretty dull and even annoying since it always feels like you're at the mercy of the dice. And I'm really not convinced 6 is the ideal player count... it seemed all too easy to push a player entirely out of the game about midway through. Also, the game doesn't really encourage alliances but to declare victory in a reasonable time frame it seems you pretty much have to start teaming up with people when you have that many players. And once the Scientist is gone... well, knowing that each role WILL be picked that round makes some of the suspense disappear. That said, I'd try it again and my rating could potentially rise.

Not a bad space lite 4x game. It's definitely Puerto Rico meets space combat, with the same role selection mechanic in place.

I enjoyed the first play. I do have some minor concerns about the balance of the different roles. Also, there's one role that basically dishes out points for inhabiting planets, but because we all held essentially the same number, nobody was incentivized to choose the role. Puerto Rico is the slicker running game.

Still, not bad, and I'd be willing to try it again. It did make me want to play Eclipse though :)

This game is a lot better than I expected. It really does feel like a successful TI3-lite. 

The most important strategic choices come in the tech race. I like the way the game adjusts when the tech tree phases out. There is adequate pressure to engage in conflict, and this is where lots of space empire games fail. Turtling will not be a successful strategy in this game. 

I look forward to playing this more. I get the sense expectations on BGG were skewed. Ultimately, I feel this game is better than the discussion on BGG would lead you to believe.

Sept. 13th, 2008 -- My first game (with four players) went okay. The game does seem like a cross between a lighter version of Twilight Imperium 3 and the role selection found in Puerto Rico (although TI3 also has role selection, so maybe it really does earn its reputation as TI3 lite).

Galactic Emperor has many of the same kinds of decisions as TI3, but it plays much quicker (a plus in my book, as I feel TI3 is far too long for what it offers). The game lacks a technology tree, which I think works for and against it. Although it simplifies building technologies and probably speeds up the game significantly , it also means you don't get that feel of progression you do in games with tech trees.

My biggest problem is it suffers from the same issue many of these civilization-esque games have -- the massive build-up and then the explosion of battle. Galactic Emperor does reward capturing other players' sectors, but I feel the style of combat lends itself to a cold war situation that could slow the game down (I found myself in this situation; one of the opponents and I would build up big and then decimate each other's fleets, all for a measly couple of VPs; then we'd be back to building up on a massive scale again).

However, the game has a good time clock for ending the game that, I believe, keeps the game moving despite any cold war situations. Despite how costly it can be to build up new fleets, you eventually have to go to war and risk your ships in order to gain VPs.

Simply for the quickness of playing such a game, I'm adding this to my want list.

Tentative rating of 6/10.

This is a fun, lite version of Twilight Imperium. It feeds the Twilight Imperium urge in a shorter amount of time. I can get some to play it that wouldn't play Twilight Imperium because of its length. This is a good, solid game.

I really want to like this game.  Puerto Rico-like mechanics, space theme, combat... but it just doesn't evoke a whole lot of feel.  I think a few more plays of playing a little more aggressively will pretty much decide if this will be a keeper or just a game that fell short.

The game is entertaining enough but I felt like not a lot really "happened" over the course of the game. My main issue is the VP scoring mechanic. To overcome someone's lead you need to knock them down and then hold your own long enough to make up the difference; it bothered me in Warrior Knights and it bothers me here as well.  I really like the "culture" concept of taking control of sectors... that's something I'd love to see more conquest games use.  

It seems like the individual parts of Galactic Emperor are good but it just didn't make all that interesting of a game. This is after only one play; rating may go up with future plays.  Right now I'd choose other conquest games over Galactic Emperor.

La palabra "Galactic" no me gusta, le tengo bastante manía a todos los juegos con esta palabra en medio ... si además se trata de un juego que copia descaradamente al Puerto Rico sin mejorarlo en nada de los nadas de toda la vida pues la cosa acaba mal ... un juego bastante aburrido la verdad, y de un tema que a mi no me apasiona.

Pretty fun game. Plays similar to Puerto Rico, in that you pick an ability, you get the special ability and then everyone gets to use that basic ability. It seems like it could be a game where either everyone does their own thing or could be pretty cut throat with battles, too.

Dont expect a 'Twilight Lite' game.

RATING: 7.5
Tentative rating based on a first play with three first-time players (2 wargamers and a Euro guy).  It was a blast and took about 3 hours.  The role selection and economic model do in fact give it a flavor of Puerto Rico in space -- with the added bonus of plastic space ships that fly around on a map and shoot at each other.

If with more players (and more experience) the fun stays the same without increasing the play time, then the rating will almost certainly go up to an 8.  If there turns out to be as much depth as it looks like there might be, then a 9 is possible.

If after a few more games things seem to play out very similarly each time, then it may drop to a 7, but I doubt it'd go lower than that.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating after a couple plays. Yep, it's pretty much [i]Puerto Rico[/i] meets [i]Twilight Imperium III[/i], which is fine. It has the same concepts as TI3 distilled down a smaller map and few unique unit types. I thought the ability to set the market price was a nice touch, and the fact that the turn order is variable keeps away the sharks.

The playing time is a little on the long side when first learning, but it improves with repeated game play.

These comments and rating are based on one 6-player game. If you abhor the thought of that, then move on; these aren't the droids you're looking for. If, instead, you can judge a first impression, for exactly what it is, then read on...

This isn't a bad game at all, but don't hop on the hype train, because you may be slightly disappointed. If you just approach it like any other game, you'll have a good time, but if you go in thinking it is going to be [gameid=12493] in 1.5 hours...

It's not [gameid=12493]. It feels less like a 4x game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) and it lacks the strong, thematic flavor that TI3 has in spades. Your race doesn't even have a face in this game (which is a subtle, but important distinction, IMO), it doesn't feel epic, the technologies seem uninspired and possibly slightly imbalanced, technology choices are even removed from the game at a certain point, you aren't really upgrading a tech tree, there are only minor differences between the different types of warships, there is very little diplomacy, the ship models are somewhat bland, and if you are the one player out of six that doesn't get attacked, it seems like you have a good shot at winning.

It isn't played in 1.5 hours. Our first game took over twice that much time. Just like any game, the more you play, the faster it will go, but it feels a bit too long for what it has been billed as. The win conditions are either zero victory points left in the pool or zero empires left for any one player. In our game, the VPs would "never" have been burned through and I have heard others say that, in their games, the same was true of empires.

So, does it sound like I hated it? I didn't. I'm just grumpy. I do plan to buy it, especially since Batman designed it *wink*. You make some interesting choices, manage resources and money, build a fleet of warships, sometimes opt for a political approach, participate in a very simple stock market system, invest in technologies, and choose roles, like in TI3. There are plenty of redeeming qualities, but just like many designers struggled to make a civ-lite game, this conversion is a struggle too.

This comment was written after only one play of the game. So take it with a grain of salt.

Summary:
---------
Basically, Galactic Emperor (GE) is Puerto Rico in space with fighting. The main mechanic of Puerto Rico, the role selection, was taken and tweaked a little bit with the addition of some additional roles. Furthermore, the personal player boards have been replaced by a map on which all player built and "settle" planets. Planets you have settled are then your main source of victory points and resources, where the later ones can be used to buy ships or special abilities.

In contrast to Puerto Rico, GE has direct conflict. With the ships you have built, you can attack other ships or planets. The fight is resolved with dice and a successful attack yields you one victory point. So, a military strategy seems to possible.

A great addition to the Puerto Rico concept is the political phase which is triggered by the selection of the Regent. In this phase, each player receives two or three political influence markers, which they place on any planet they like. If you have the majority of political influence markers on a planet at the end of the phase, the planet becomes part of your empire. In case of tie, the planet becomes neutral again. At the end of the Regent phase, you receive one victory point for each planet you own.

The game ends once the victory point pool is depleted or at least one player placed his last Empire Token.

Comments:
----------
* I do like Puerto Rico and all of it's descendants. GE is no exception in this regard. The space setting is a nice change of pace and the basic ideas of Puerto Rico have been transfered nicely to this setting.

* I'm not so sure about the direct conflict in GE. Lately, I've come to the conclusion that I do like direct conflict in two player games, but not in games with more players. In two player games, each conflict I win gives me some benefit and gets me a bit closer to victory. So I can see the point of attacking someone. With more players, there are often games in which one player attacks another player without any immediate benefit for themselves. The player who manages to stay out of battles often has a better chance of winning. Perhaps this is a problem of the group with which I play, but often times, games with direct conflict feel a little random to me. 

* Due to the Regent phase, no planet is ever save. You shouldn't get too attached to your planets. Just see them as what the are: A victory point source. The mechanism to steal planets from someone else in the Regent phase is also a nice counter against military players. At least, it worked for me in my sole game.

When I first heard of Galactic Emperor I was pretty intrigued by it. So intrigued that I ended up pre-ordering a copy from Coolstuff. When I first got it I was able to get it on the table a bit, but like many other games that fail to capture the imagination of my play groups, it faded with time. I still like and respect it, but ultimately I realized we were not playing it anymore and I traded it away.

RATING: 6.5
After my 1st play (3-player game) this was at the top of my 'Must play again' list.  After my 2nd play, it has been removed.  Why?  Well...

1st Play: The game went well (as a learning game).  One of us emerged the leader about 3/4 into the game.  Myself & the other teamed up & beat him down.  I didn't pull the turnaround quick enough & came in second, where the beatdown player finished last.  Final score was 48-44-40: Still, a pretty close game.

2nd play: This was a 5-player game, and 30 minutes into gameplay, I was beatdown by 2 adjacent players.  I suffered immense losses on 2 Warlord actions, and that pretty much left me hobbling the rest of the game.  Perhaps this was due to dice rolls, or perhaps this was due to 3 newbies not realizing that you need to gang up on the leader - whatever.  I spent the remaining two hours basically watching others play.  Final score: 38-38-34-27-14.  Yeah, I was the 14.

3rd play:  I took a different strategy, and it resulted in a tie for first place (right down to the dollar!).  I finally have an appreciation, and a better understanding of the subtle nuances the role selection has.  Looking forward to the next outing.

Conclusion: I feel the map does not scale well for anything above 4 players, and I could just imagine how 6 players would be: Immense downtime. AP is a big issue, even to those who self-proclaim they are "AP immune".  This game needs an expansion to fix the perceived base game limitation of 4 players.  Specifically:
1) Individual player boards to scale for the # of players.
2) More than just 2 ways to score VPs (currently, only the Regent role & battles where an Empire is destroyed).
3) Some Technologies seem unbalanced - need a technology stream, or something along those lines.
4) The Regent phase seldom looks appealing to players in last place (VP-wise).  Perhaps splitting this role into 2 separate roles could make it more appealing to those in last place.

The Galactic conquest theme, the role selection & simple battles I absolutely love, and believe this is a perfect 3-4 player game (which would take 3-4 hours).

Twilight Imperium-style game that can be played in under two hours?  Bring it on!!!

Our first game took about 2.5 hours, but close enough.  I felt we got the basic idea of a TI session in a fraction of the time.  The game seemed to play out in two parts.  In part one, the Omega Sun is still shining and empires are fanning out across the galaxy.  Then, part 2, the sun implodes into a black hole, the galaxy has been explored and staked out.  New tech is no longer available and the fighting begins.

The nice thing here is that you have a 30-45 minute fighting part and that's it.  No hard feelings.  No playing for hours being hopelessly behind.  Our game was very close with scores of 33-37-39-39.  The two leaders battled it out in the black hole in a terribly lobsided battle--1 dreadnought vs. 3 cruisers and 3 fighters.  Dread lost.  Yellow won!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Long game for 6. Probably 4 is best.

Stewart and Merchant need serious example and explaining. So does black hole, retreating and phases of battle for non-battle initiated. Fun, and builds tension until Warlord is used. Must have alliance.  Rules have some holes - or explaining to do.  

We played some exceptions: a)black hole as neutral, so many teams can congregate there; b) Move all, then attack one at a time. (Not Move one attack one..etc); c) Regent simular, 1st player pick to buy and place then next - not a round of buy for all and then a round of place for all. d) we played ships can skip sector without battling on 2 sector movements IF that sector has empire - starbase you can't skip.

RATING: 6
At first the game was compared to Twilight Imperium, however everyone typically explains this as Puerto Rico, in space with fighting which is pretty accurate.  Yes there is dice-rolling in combat which I typically despise however this game has a wonderful '3 phase' combat system which pretty much make dice rolling ok by me.  My initial impression is that the game starts out like Puerto Rico with resource acquisition but then ends up with a lot of combat after a build up period.  So far I have only played with 3 players and I feel with more players it wouldn't seem like the game has a build up phase and then an attack phase.  Right now I would rather play either Puerto Rico or a different combat game than this hybrid.  I don't see myself lowering the score to this game, but definitely has the potential to increase after more plays with a higher player count.

RATING: 4
I can't forgive this game for being such a blatant rip-off of TI3. Despite its shorter (and thus more merciful) length, the same flaws apply - Glacial pace in the beginning as people gather resources to build their fleets. Then they spend the rest of the game blowing their fleets in massive dicefests until the end. 

It's also weird in that players have to "cooperate" in getting those resources just to keep the early game from becoming even more of a bore, i.e., if no one picks the Merchant and Steward for a few turns.

The designer has made an admirable effort to balance the game, faithful to its eurogame inspiration (Puerto Rico). Two of my four plays, all with different players, have ended in draws, which were resolved as per the rule book: a final battle among the winners. The components are sturdy and functional, but artwork is scarce and unimaginative. The plastic ships are very cool, although the dreadnought overwhelms the tiles. I appreciate the game but it feels to me a bit restrictive and dry for its theme, maybe a byproduct of its exquisite balance. Some of my friends really love it. I fear it may suffer an early retirement after we try Eclipse.

Update: Sold to a eurogamer friend who is more of a fan than I am.

RATING: 7
Update: game survived its second game without too much degradation.  I'm not sure how many more times I'ld play it as a lot depends on the interaction between the roles and player choices.  The game works, and I feel the technologies are interesting.  As it turns out, the shields can be just as powerful if not more than the Plasma guns.  Funny but it seems so.  I like it still but I dunno if there aren't other games I'ld rather be playing instead...

===================================
A pleasant and manageable space opera game which does precisely what the box says it does; a 90-120 minute game of space exploration and conflict.  I think the economic engine and the Regent power works really well to force the game along at a nice pace.  My only real concern is the balancing of the technologies; the Space Pirates is way undercosted for the effect and considering that the Saboteur can blow up in your face for the same cost, it's too silly a thing to have missed in playtesting.  Also, the Plasma Weapons are ridiculously more powerful than the Shields yet cost less; another unspeakable oversight.  Otherwise, the game is quite satisfying.  Consider these comments as first impressions from a one game experience.  If that's anything to go by, I would never have played other games that had far worse balancing issues; I'm more than ready to test these impressions very soon.

Excellent components and board.  I did replace the cardboard chits with some beautiful plastic gems, really steps up the game's look.

It plays well and it's exactly what you think it will be.  It's a good approximation of a Twilight Imperium III "light".  Now, I really love TI-3 and this is not a real substitute.  But it's a great game and takes much less time to play.  I still prefer TI-3, but will play this if we want a similar game but have less time to invest.

I recommend this game.  It's a great science fiction themed board game.  And it's fun.

Update Dec 2011.  Eclipse is a better choice.  This one has role selection (like TI-3) which is neat, but really Eclipse is a much more elegant design.

RATING: 6
Well what an interesting game; the strategies are not yet fully revealing themselves and I will certainly need to give it another few outings.

The ruleset is problematic; layout is good but there is no clear explanation for some elements I thought were important - how the subphases are conducted, for example; incrementally or totally.

The component quality also could have been better - thicker, more durable tiles and more functional ship models (outsized dreadnoughts).

Finally the game went on too long; but this could be just a first play thing. It states 90 minutes on the box but with five players we were at twice that (including rules explanations).  Then again, it was a bit like that with Puerto Rico first time out...

[b]Update June 2014:[/b] After last night's game, the first in years, I am not as enamoured with it as I was a few years back. It still went on much longer than is implied and elements felt artificial. I am dropping my rating to a six, but despite my feeling there are underdeveloped aspects to this game, I am willing to give it another shot. It's just a matter of when...

Likes: I think the game has great components. I've heard that some of the tiles and money chits wear out quickly but so far not a problem for me.  It does play quicker than Twilight Imperium 3 while providing almost the same epic experience. I really like the regent role. 

Dislikes: Even though it's longer I'd still rather play Twilight Imperium.  It would be nice if there were more Tech advances... Expansion maybe?

Overall: Great game and a great effort to provide Twilight Imperium 3 in a smaller and quicker package.  Because it's quicker I think it will get more plays than TI3 over time.

This is the fastest galactic conquest board game ever made. The use of the role system moves the game along nicely and makes the turns unpredictable.

I suppose this ultimately is not my kind of game.  This has a feel similar to Twilight Imperium 3, in that it marries the role selection of Puerto Rico with the usual war engine found in games such as Nexus Ops.  However, I don't nearly detest this game as much as I did TI3 largely due to the fact it takes about half a day less to play to completion, nor do I think it is as excellent and polished a design as Nexus Ops. 
 I just find the process in these games to be dry, and the combat systems to really serve no real means other than shedding and gaining minimal VPs.  The economy in this game is a little strange, in that one is limited to very few resources (I imagine as an artificial balancer) and the production phase is out of sync with the market phase, making any planet beyond a couple of resource planets moot (except for a single VP).  One never feels the growth, or expansion throughout the empire, as both the map and the take over conditions are small in scope.  Fly a ship over a planet, voila! it's yours if no one owns it.  These games have great premises, but in reality players are really encouraged to hunker down and turtle, making nominal strikes to gain aforementioned 1 VP swings.  THis makes these games drag out, and expose the limitations of the system and the ineffectual design of the actual game in large.  
I suppose if this is your thing, and if little plastic spaceships can transport you beyond the card and board, and beyond a lackluster design then you should enjoy Galactic Emperor.  I will stick with Nexus Ops if I want to play a space battle.

Puerto Rico in space is a fitting description of the mechanics. The problem with the game is that there is no real incentive to go out and attack anyone. A poor euro/wargame hybrid, particularly with much better options available. The technologies were somewhat interesting.

This was a disappointment.  I had envisioned a Puerto Rico type game with a Twilight Imperium theme that would play in about 90 minutes. What I got was 5 hours of tedious rules discussion.  We had to stop and discussion several aspects of the rules along the way and people were really over analyzing what should have been a simple game. Part of me would like to try it again and part of me is scared of subjecting myself to 5 hours of tedium.

This is based on one play where we missed an important rule that directly caused me to be wiped out (attacker from the Black Hole can't retreat) so take it with a grain of salt... but it didn't show me anything that would convince me to play again in any case. A lot of cobbled-together mechanics that don't really gel to form any sort of coherent picture. The one big strategy takeaway I learned from our play session was this: the techs are wildly unbalanced and unbalancing, and owning a couple of the best techs is critical. If you miss out on the juiciest morsels from the early tech rush you have already lost, 15 minutes into a 2-3 hour game--not fun.

The rulebook is miserably laid out, particularly given that there are so many rules and so many that require minute clarifications. It's very easy to miss important points.

RATING: 5
Less than the sum of its parts. The role-selection turn mechanism means each turn is a series of actions and reactions requiring timing and optimization -- this inhibits the sense of deliberate expansion and advancement that I expect of a galactic conquest game. The narrative arc is also minimal ... I controlled more planets by the end of the game, but I didn't feel especially more capable than I did on the first turn. There was no feeling of slowly mounting a tech tree and evolving into a super race for the game's final act. The fleets are fragile in terms of the damage they can absorb, and because ships are relatively scarce, a few bad dice can wildly swing a battle -- unlike, say, Axis & Allies, you never have thirty infantry in a space to balance out those runs of the dice. And, like all of these plastic-pieces-on-a-map games, the pieces themselves are more hinderance than help, piled into too-small hexes in unsightly piles, obscuring the information you need to see beneath. Didn't expect much and pretty much got what I expected.

I think this game is good, but it suffers from the same problem as Puerto Rico, where the victory point accumulation seems to be a goal that isn't in keeping with the game. What I mean is that you must trigger the use of the influence action very carefully and it is not really the best fleet or colonies that win the game, rather the timing and use of influence.

Quite derivative, using the role selection of "Puerto Rico" and "Race for the Galaxy" (some roles and theme are more reminiscent of the latter) and the combat system of "Nexus Ops". But I know no other game of space exploration and conquest that provides a satisfying experience in the same time frame. Not as short as claimed, and actually the main flaw is that it may drag quite a bit if the regent role is not chosen often enough.

Puerto Rico without any of the interest, a poor dice rolling combat mechanic ripped from other games, low quality components, poorly written rules, unbalanced poorly phrased building/technologies and a gruelling overlong experience.

I like how there are two ways to expand your territory: combat (warlord phase) or diplomacy (regent phase). The former uses hard to produce ships, the latter uses hard to acquire money.

I like this game; the components are of adequate built (but definitely lack appeal) and the game is engaging, its length allowing for more outings than, say, TI3.
The Puerto Rico prioritizing of roles is nicely imported.
However, I would have liked some more chrome; for instance, technologies could have sported some more text, an illustration maybe (and be printed on a playing card), and could be more diverse.  Players could have been assigned races or factions...
I really do think a layer of theme could have been added without affecting the gameplay, for the better because the whole feel of this solid game is rather dry.

RATING: 7
Rating after a 6-player game.  The game is a very light version of Twilight Imperium, but still takes a long time to play with 6 players.  After the game a few of us discussed the possibility of trying it again, but with only 4 players.

In order to win one has to score the most victory points (VP chits are the only hidden info), and VP are accumulated via the control of planets (1 VP/planet) as well as the destruction/removal of the last "influence" token (i.e. control marker) of an opponent (1 VP).

The Regent phase, where the VPs are scored and where it is possible to place 2-3 Influence/Control markers, allows players to reduce someone else's control of a system, or even take control without firing a shot.  Although cheaper than building ships, it can give you the edge, until you can reinforce with the navy.

Our 6-player game ended with the following scores: 29, 26, 21, 14, 14 and 12.  My impression was that the person with 26 points would win, but another player's last play was to not attack the leaders, thus allowing them to retain their planets/points as well as score 2 easy points, else it would have been tighter for 1st place.

The comments about GE being a blend of TI3 and PR are true. The GE theme overlays nicely onto the PR role selection mechanic. Resource cubes and cash are also reminiscent of PR. Exploration and expansion feels like TI3, without the intricacies that slow the other game down. Purchased influence, which is bid in the order of the Regent's choosing is similar to the bid mechanic in Game of Thrones. The game's various roles interweave nicely, and deliberately. The game is immersive, where one feels like their "empire" is growing slowly within a fog of war, yet it is deceptively quick--ending suddenly within 2 to 2.5 hours. Can't wait to try it again. Initial rating: "8".

Update (06/18/10): It came with much anticipation, and then disappeared. Where did it go? Downing to a "7".

RATING: 2
I've played this as 3-player and 6-player and hated it both times. I haven't played every game out there but GE is the least liked game I've played since discovering BGG.

The game is fiddly and cramped, with the hexes holding a half dozen or dozen ships in addition to their starbase marker and food cubes.

A 3-player game took 2 hours (way beyond the estimated 90 minute playing time) and that was mostly helped along by somewhat suicidal, king-making by one of the players. The 6-player game took so long two of us wanted to jump off the balcony just to make it end.

Because of the small-unit density and dice rolling it encourages turtling. Why risk sending out your dreadnought when everything hinges on just two or three dice rolls? Nothing about combat felt tactical or strategic.

The "buying influence" phase of the Regent role felt out of place both times I played. If you try to use your puny 2 (or 3) influence to sabotage a rival you're more likely to just end up in a zero-sum stalemate unless you get luck with turn order.

With 6-players the exploration and scientist phases are over almost instantly and the last player has poor role choices. With 3-players there's no need to make contact with other players for much of the game and only 3 roles get chosen meaning it can be a long time between the produce and consume phases. 3-players also suffers from the unfortunate "one person feels like they are getting ganged up on" problem.

A couple of big loses in battle can mean de-facto player elimination but they have to sit in there and continue to take turns for the remainder of the game even though they have no hope.

For a game with a near identical theme Nexus Ops is far, far more fun for me.

GE is one of the few games that I will, in the future, simply excuse myself from the table rather than play just because the group decided to give it a go.

RATING: 6
Borrowing elements from top-rated games seems to be a common tactic for new publishers (see Eagle/Tropical games for other examples) and here we have Puerto Rico-style role selection mixed with roll-the-dice combat similar to a block wargame. If you can cope with the usual arbitraryness of deciding who you pick on you'll have some fun, but the scientific upgrades are nowhere near equally appealling and the Regent action yields far more VPs than the Warlord. Playing with 4 seems about right, with more the board is more crowded and lengthy (and unrewarding) fighting is more common.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played one 6 player game. Certainly an interesting hybrid of Puerto Rico's role selection mechanic and Nexus Ops style combat, in space (I haven't played TI3). I like how it all fits together but the game did drag significantly towards the end as well as having one player who felt completely out of the game from early on. I'd like it more if it was a few rounds shorter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An OK game, but one with too little combat and no great feeling of taking over the galaxy.  It feels as though the counter mix is too limited - you don't get enough to be able to garrison many hexes and the first player to get a big fleet together can do serious damage to everyone else.

It's more of an arms race followed by a brief period of mass destruction.

I'd like to try the game with unlimited fleets to see what happens.

It played much smoother than even the rules suggested.  I believe it does a good job of blending the initial exploration phase into the endgame conquest phase.  Combat in particular has a very nice and clean execution to it.

Nice concept (Puerto Rico-style role selecting + building of a space empire packed in a relatively quick game), but there are some problems with the execution:

Galactic Emperor is an enjoyable 4x space game driven by a role selection mechanic. The rules are fairly straightforward, but a few potential hiccups if not explained thoroughly.

A clever amalgamation of Struggle of Empires (the technology tree) and Puerto Rico. There's a bit more randomness than in PR, though, which adds a lot, to my mind. Also - a map! With pieces that move around! Instead of brown "colonists!" Amazing!

I sort of turtled for the whole game, and lost by about 1/5 of my total score, which was not wholly unexpected. The game rewards finding clever ways to leave your space undefended for a little while and then using roles, resources, and the influence chips to cover your flanks or at least minimize losses. If I had it all to do over again, I'd bring much better snacks in order to ensure that I'd go first, and then I'd be much more aggressive.

for items were..  What The ....!!!!. Steward(industrialist?), Merchant (farmer?) Regent( U guess?) _am I playing a middle ages game !   
Have rule book handy !! _ Its a real page turner !!

While better than Twilight Imperium, I'd much prefer just to play Puerto Rico instead.  PR feels much more smooth and refined, GC is herky jerky and ponderous with what feels to me to be too few ways to score VPs.  Building up a stalwart military is essential if you don't want to be left in the dust.  I think it still feels too long for what it is although it certainly is much better than TI in that regard!

This is really TI3 light - plays much faster with less flavor. While I enjoy playing it, I am not sure whether it will last repeating plays. 
I am also curious whether deep down there is really that much strategy involved as the first impression suggests.

One play with 4. Has some TI mechs that works OK. Science advances not hardly worth the cost.

Players are forced to be aggressive due to VP scoring. Al lot comes down to a bit of maneuvering, better dice and no small amount of convincing others that someone else is "The Threat".

Will play again but purchase is iffy.

There's more here akin to Twilight Imperium than any other game. It's lighter, faster, and easier to get into, but still has a wealth of avenues to victory. It's also VERY easy on the eyes. 

Interestingly it has an exploration option that works very similarly to Big Kini...another game I like.

It's not "original" in the most common sense, but what it does do is deliver a solid, tense, fun game, with plenty of opportunity for player interaction. 

Update:

Eclipse just upped the ante and made this game irrelevant.

2013-02-01 (8): Provisional rating after one 3p game. Completely generic space strategy driven by role selection - but it is fun and it has spaceships, battles and all... :)

Negatives:
- Completely generic, no story, no starting asymetry, nothing.
- Plastic spaceships (same as in Eclipse if I'm not mistaken) are cool, but need hexes twice as big due to unlimited stacking.

Positives:
+ Balanced. All players have the same opportunities, it is up to them how they thrive.
+ Rules are simple.
+ It is quick, our very first 3p game took 2 hrs.
+ SPACE BATTLES!!!

What a dissappointment.  I had my hopes on this one.  I was thinking it really would be a great space conquering romp, ala Twillight Imperium, but with crisp rules, like Puerto Rico.  Nope.  It's kind of repetitive, and can quickly degenerate into a game of A knocks on B, B knocks on C, C knocks on D, and then D knocks on A, and no one gets anywhere.

Galactic Emperor is a title that pretty clearly is taking the Twilight Imperium concept and carving it up into a more streamlined experience. As a result the game lacks that great TI3 feel but succeeds on its own merits despite this.

The components are pretty substandard, thin card stock for everything that has the tendency to start warping as soon as it's punched. The ships are a lightweight plastic but are serviceable though their design seems to be somewhat amatuerish and lacks detail.

The role and tech cards are informative for the most part but a couple of them are missing some useful details so not as good a summary as they could be. Likewise the player aid cards can be very confusing on the ship detail side where two dice with a 4 and a 6 on them is supposed to represent you roll two dice and a 4-6 result equals a hit.

Despite some flaws this is a good experience for when you want a 4x style game but don't feel like commiting the time and effort to a game of Twilight Imperium.

The comments saying this game is Puerto Rico in space are more right than the ones that say this is TI III light. Galactic Emperor is much more role driven than TI (where most of the actions you take are largely unconnected to the Strategy card(s) you pick). I did pick up the game because I was searching for a TI light, but this is not it. However, Galactic Emperor is a good game on it's own and incorperates the space exploration theme very well.

I like the way you can choose to expand your empire by force or by 'political' influence. Both options seem pretty viable, although in our game we did attack the other players to late to make a difference. 

Our first game took about 90 minutes complemented by at most 30 minutes of learning the rules. I really don't see how games can take 3-5 hrs as other players have commented.

I do have some minor complaints about the game. First the rulebook is missing some information, like if technologies that normally apply during a warlord role also apply during the final battle (answer: yes). The descriptions on the role cards themselves also could have been clearer. I also wish there were more technologies, because there are few to begin with and the choice becomes really limited when some seem significantly worse than others.

Bitter disappointment. This isn't Puerto Rico in space. What makes PR isn't the role selection mechanic, it's the building powers - these allow players to develop different strategies. There is no equivalent in GE, no sense of strategic development, no tension. Unfortunately this isn't made up for by the combat since there isn't much differentiation between the ship types.

I love TI3. This games gives me my fix in about 2H (this was our 1st play, so it is pretty good).

However, be careful because order is very very important in the game.

It is nice that you have lots of tough decisions, chances for backstabbing, streamlined and fast combat system (some luck, but you can in general control the sucess or failure in battle through proper mix of ships in a fleet).

Some racial abilities would be nice, but I understand why it would just add more complexity and go against the game's objective of being fast and streamlined.

The only bad thing was the components quality.. It some of the cubes broke apart in the 1st play away - great support from Adam and Cross cut, as I got replacement in less than a week. 

The original tiles feel like they will bend and break easily, but the 2nd print upgrade that Cross Cut made available fix all the problems. I love to play with the new components

Or, here's a concept - some actual space exploring! And no, I don't consider turning over four tiles and choosing the one I want *exploring*.

This game beg to be a Non-Euro.  It's a quite fun game but you can be virtually put out of the loop soon enough.  Player elimination IS NOT something to avoid when something like that happens.

Rating based on one play with 6 players.  It did feel like a light TI3.  I felt about the same at the end after losing and feeling out of it for quite a while just like I did in my one game of TI3, but in less than half the time.  Still, it seemed too long, but it was a first game.  Looks nice, feels tight, but I would rather play Nexus Ops if in the mood for conquest in space.

As the bastard child of Puerto Rico and TI3, I so want to like this game more than I do.

With 3 or 4 players it can be enjoyable.

This is a good game, but wow, is it ever derivative.  I think it's meant to be, so hopefully the designer won't take offense, but it's so much like Twilight Imperium 3e that any casual gamer walking by would hardly notice a difference.  Plastic ships with an Axis and Allies like combat system?  Check.  Modular hexagonal board with planets to take over?  Check.  Role selection like Puerto Rico?  Check.  Economic and political system?  Check.  In short, if you like TI3 but think it'd be a better game if only it took 2 hours instead of 4 hours, then check this game out.  Again, I mean no disrespect and it's on my own want list - hey, I like TI3, but it's tough to find the time to play it!

I find there are a lot of things to like about Galactic Emperor. The space conquest theme appeals to many gamers. The role selection presents some important (but not very subtle) decisions. There are multiple ways of expanding your influence and manipulating the flow of victory points. It's also fun to cause chain reactions of invasions with a carefully timed tactical strike. The amount of direct conflict can vary a lot depending on the group of players. My games tend to end up being conflict heavy, although I really think that combat units are best used for 1) deterrence and 2) rare but critically timed invasions. Played conflict-heavy, technologies seem awfully strong, so it's important to know that going in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More dry than Twilight Imperium but easier to fit into a gaming session.  I don't have a solid feel for this one yet.  The technology cards are hit-and-miss with some clearly stronger than others.  I'm a big tech geek who likes to focus on the tech tree in my civ-type games so the flatness of this one was a bit disappointing.

A couple of the colored cubes were defective in my copy, but easily replaced.

Update: after my second play with six people, I am going to limit this game to longer marathon-type events.

Second update: I was talked to trying it again in a quieter environment with three players, and it went much better.

TI3 with less calories . . .  If I had never played TI3, then GE would be the best space empire game out there . . . or is that Eclipse . . . or . . .  It has a lot to offer: (1) has all the basic elements of TI3, plus some new nuances like the supernova which bans the scientists, surprise attacks/no retreats from the remnant black hole, explorer role turning to warlord, etc.; (2) IMHO feels like a better adaptation of Puerto Rico's role system and economics than TI3; (3) unique use of dice to establish the Market (that feels a bit like Kingsburg); and (4) plays relatively fast for the conqueroring of an entire galaxy, nay the universe.  The downside (which has been expressed by more than just me) rests primarily in the last point--it plays relatively fast, maybe too fast.  Just when you feel that the game has some teeth and is getting interesting, boom, its over.  Also, even though it has the overall look and feel of an epic space game, it is just . . .  missing "something" . . .

RATING: 5.6

Sadly, Gal Emp boils off what is best of Puerto Rico and TI3 out of the mix, leaving a strategy/Euro hybrid that is entirely colorless and too long to play for what it is.  The danger, of course, with Civ-lite games is that you steam out the Civ and are left with the "lite".  Now, we tried this with six, which was epic fail, as the player on the end of two consecutive turns has no hope of winning, but I can't see that it would be much better with five or four.  Where is the texture, color, flavor, variety or personality?  I have damned TI3 in print many a time as a bloated space opera game with a Euro struggling, Alien-like, to emerge, but at least TI3 HAS space opera elements and a nod to the grandeur that term signifies.  Gal Emp, trying to please everybody, remains entirely derivative and clone-like.  If you're going to consume the calories anyway, why not go with the originals, however flawed?

Wow this is Eclipse lite! A nice role selection mechanic (think San Juan) drives the game forward.

Great fun!

The game is not bad and has the advantage to be not too long, given the kind of game it is (a strategic space game). I have discovered lately that I am less interested in these sort of games (I didn't like Starcraft either). I prefer resource management games and more generally games in which other can ruin your plans, but not completely destroy them (e.g. Kingmaking).

In GE I have noticed that being last in the first turn can be an enormous disadvantage, especially if playing with many players.

A lightish space empire civilization game, using the Puerto Rico role selection mechanism. There's a moderate amount of dice combat, which works quite nicely. 

The graphics are fine and the spaceships are way cooler than I expected, but the money chits are useless. The text on the role cards does not include all of the obligatory actions, which is a bit cumbersome.

Like most self-published games, some extra development would not hurt; Especially the roles and technologies need some balancing. Anyway, as a whole, the game felt quite nice and I'm definitely willing to play again.

A bit longish though, considering the gameplay weight, and I would not try this with more than five players. Maybe not even with five, since the five player board setup favors the fifth player.

RATING: 6
A hit-the-leader whine-fest slug-fest. The conquer space theme is a hint of what's coming, with a draping of disguise offered by the Puerto Rico style role selection. That curtain's pulled aside pretty quickly. Each planet you control is a VP. So ... build ships, spread influence, control planets, then decide whether to turtle or go whacking. There's no combat advantage to attack or defence - it's a dice-fest. Which can be costly and painful when you lose against the odds and have to re-build your forces. If you're the VP leader (which is hidden trackable information, being the sum of how many planets you've controlled each time scoring's been chosen), you'll be attacked by your two neighbours. How the game develops from there is really up to your gamegroup. Will you be trampled into the dust with no income to rebuild, or will the new leader turtle to defend the inevitably coming attacks? If everyone turtles, then you'll have a draggy game until people *have* to attack. Someone will be winning after all. The role selections are interesting enough to provide some thought each turn as to which one will advantage you most, and your efforts will be to try and setup so there's always something great for you to choose but you'll also be able to take advantage of the roles others choose. These include produce food, transfer food into resource cubes, transfer resource cubes into ships or some basic tech tree improvements, add more planets to be explored, count VPs. Just don't be the first one pummelled. There's no catchup mechanisms here, and you'll be off the pace the rest of the game. If you're going to play, don't emotionally invest in the result and don't let the Euro trappings fool you into thinking this is anything other than a luck-based whack-fest.

A simplified 4X game with role-selection. Some cool ideas, particularly with the market for goods and the political influence phase - I wish both of these had been developed more. In particular, it would be cool if pursuing political control was a viable counter to a military route. However, limiting all players to 3 influence markers during the regent phase makes this impossible. I also wish the role selection imposed a bit more opportunity for messing with opponents, a la Puerto Rico's Captain. One idea would be to force food consumption during the Steward phase.

This game does a very good job of delivering the feel of a galactic conquest game, but without the huge amount of time or rules. First game was played in about 2 hours with 5 people. The game consistently plays in about 2 hours. This is not a full substitute for a Twilight Imperium, but does a good job in the small time window that it takes to play.

I can't help but think this is Puerto Rico combined with Nexus Ops.  It's hard for the game to really come across as its own being.  I also can't help but think I might as well be playing Puerto Rico followed by a game of Nexus Ops.

The game is fun for all that.

RATING: 5
Only played the last 45 minutes of a game (took over for another player) but I saw enough to make a knee-jerk assessment:
It follows the flaws of many well-regarded Euros - mainly it wasn't balanced yet it is a point/role-optimization game.
For me, unless there is a semblance of balance, the Euro optimization mechanisms aren't welcome.
Some players can be hosed by getting a bad Explorer tile draw in the very beginning, putting them behind the curve of resource development. The Run Away Leader problem is supposedly addressed by the Bash the Leader syndrome, but I just don't think there's a need for this game nowadays, now that other games (namely Nexus Ops and Risk revisions) do it quicker and better.
The components (other than the oversized ship figures) felt like a prototype - very home-made feel. I didn't even see a player aid that showed what each ship had to roll to get a hit.
Throw in the absurdity of the Black Hole (easily wipe out the equivalent of 22+ resources in one move - not easy to stop) and I see no reason to spend 2+ hours hoping people don't gang up on my position and render my strategy moot.

RATING: 7.5
I've played this game twice now - once with four players, once with six.  Note that I haven't played the games most people are comparing this to (Puerto Rico and TI3).

I like the game, but there are several small problems that hold it back from being a great game:

- The Sciences seem unbalanced and mis-priced.  The combat ones in particular don't seem well thought-out in relation to each other.  Most are "help one roll per combat" or even one per turn, but one of them helps you much more frequently, and doesn't seem to be priced accordingly.

- On one level, the theme works fine - it does feel like a "4X" game ("eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate") translated to the tabletop.  But it's a very *generic* 4X game.  It really calls out for more flavor - perhaps the six factions could have individual names and slightly different strengths and weaknesses, for instance.  It might even work well with an appropriate SF license (I could see it working as a Star Trek or Babylon 5 game, for instance, without having to tweak too much.)

- The ergonomics of the game aren't great.  The (also very generic) ship tokens don't quite work, with huge battles requiring a big messy heap of plastic in one hex.  I've been wondering if it might work better with one on-board piece to represent an entire fleet, which could be represented as individual ships on little mini-board.  (Possibly players could add their own flavor in this way, substituting their favorite ship miniatures from elsewhere?)

Oddly, my conclusion is the opposite of many on a couple issues.  Granted, it's based on only two games, but I think it plays better with six.  The players come into conflict sooner, which I think is a good thing for this game.  I don't think it takes all that long, either.  Our six-player game (with four total newbies and two players who'd only played once before and screwed up some rules early, which required some sorting-out) took 2 1/2 hours, which I think is a pretty zippy pace for a game like this.  (I expect our next play would take more like 2 hours.)

Ultimately, I think the game could use another round of testing and development.

It's almost impossible not to describe this as "Twilight Imperium Lite." Simpler rules, less time to play, but much the same feel. I prefer the epic goodness of TI3, but I enjoyed Galactic Emperor.

RATING: 5
Expand and conquer in space. A light multi-player wargame, this does a few things right, but a lot of the key things poorly. Good points are that it will come to an end because of the finite number of VP tokens to collect. The technology implemented as one-off cards means that players will have somewhat different play styles forced on them.

The poor: the Regent phase is pure leader bashing. There are no restrictions on who you can take down, and if multiple players target one player (each attacking different planents) then that player is quickly knocked down. The role selection doesn't really work: some roles are hopeless compared with others, and there is not much skill in getting the sequencing right. There are no real surprises: you see the enemy fleet building up and lumbering over towards you - even Risk with cashing in cards and making a huge raid offers more drama and a chance to pull off surprising moves.

This game works, but is relatively uninspired. Perhaps OK as 2-player, but then there are better games to play.

--Aug2008-- The _Puerto Rico_ echoes are there.  While the game transcends its background to provide a distinctly different game experience, it's not clear to me that any of the deltas are beneficial.
 My first game ended (subjectively) very abruptly.  I think several plays might be necessary to come to a good feel for the game arc.  Equally, some of the technologies look exceedingly valuable:  it'll be interesting to discover whether there's a natural balance among them, or whether costs are tweaked over time.

RATING: 7
I agree with most of the feedback I've read.  It's a concentrated TI3-like game (though that doesn't really explain the game adequately).  Some things that were a bit confusing were some of the board/card markings and the way the points system did not seem to favor the most dominating player in the game.  That can actually be a good thing--in our game, the most dominant military player was wiping out the galaxy from one corner to the other, but the opponents were quietly stocking up on point-generating systems (though they weren't long for this world) and tallying more than even they expected.  In the end, the most military player had the least points, and two of the remaining players (including the winner) were within 2-3 points of each other.  Confusing at first--but the more I thought about it the more I wanted to play again.  The fact that it incorporates a lot from other games like TI3, Puerto Rico (et al) should make it a nice alternative to those who love (or even like) TI3 either in theme or in theory, but don't have the attention span or the free time to devote to it . . . while the relative simplicity of the game should make it a bit more wife- and maybe even young-kid-friendly than something more epic and involved.  Definitely worth checking out.  It's also worth reading the directions--they had us laughing out loud (especially the end game explanation and aftermath).

RATING: 6
Slightly bland and mediocre: it's less a streamlined space opera and more an emasculated one. The game lacks character: all the sides are the same and only differentiate slightly in the course of the game through the technologies.

The economic system feels slightly clunky and "inorganic" compared to the rest of the game. There is a lack of choice in the techs. The combat system is very basic and lacks nuance. Everything is restricted somewhat artificially by the component limitations. The influence system is also very rough.

This game seems so outdated after playing Eclipse.

Traded for Goa.

Very nice civ game set in outer space, which takes care of production, commerce, development, exploration and warfare in a very simple and intuitive way, but without taking away the deep and challenge of all the decisions that players have to make.  It borrows the action system from [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=248&Itemid=1]Puerto Rico[/url][/i], and maybe the scientific research can be compared with the special buildings of that game also, but everything else is very original and easy to play.  Great game, could be an easy 9, but there is a lot of kingmaking situations that brings it down to an 8, which is, of course, still very good.

While this is not PR with combat, nor is it Twilight Imperium in a third of the time, it does a darn good job of giving that impression.  The economic engine system may be slightly unbalanced, and some of the cards aren't worded very well, but the game is over so quickly that you don't really mind.
edit: this will end up going down a full point soon (I don't do "part points"!) as I think I've now exhausted the basic premise enough to know that I'd still rather play PR or TI; that's not to belittle this game but it's not quite there.

It's hardly fair to rate a game like this after only one play, but I'm going to do it anyway!  The first impression after playing it is that it really IS a "[GAMEID=12493] lite" (which is a huge compliment, and which also leaves me wondering how the author got away with copying the style of his game's big brother so closely).  Indeed, I'm delighted to have a game of space empire development, exploration, and conquest that doesn't take an entire day to play!  But it's still one of those games that requires one play-through to really figure out how everything comes together, so I'm itching to play it again and am curious to see how my rating might change.  As for the game components in this 2nd edition, all the cardboard pieces are very thick and sturdy and the planet artwork is very cool.  The empire/starbase tokens are functional but boring (I went to quite a bit of effort to create my own replacements for them, and use the original tokens as influence markers).  The biggest disappointment for me (and the game designers are going to have a stroke if they read this, after all the work they had to go to in order to correct the component problems of the first edition) is the ships themselves.  I don't like the strange, rounded design of the wings or the seemingly brittle hard plastic material of which they are made, and I feel like they could have been so much cooler/intimidating-looking.  And finally, what the frak is a medieval king doing on the box cover of a space empire game???  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

RATING: 8
Even though I love this game, I also miss some flavor. I hope the expansion adds alien powers or stuff like that.

EDIT 2012-07-11: Lowered the rating a little, mainly due to having tried Twilight Imperium at last. Now, the game is still very good, but now when I play can't help thinking "Yes, but in TI3..."
To be fair, I still think the game would be immensely enhanced with a little chrome, say some more techs and racial traits, and I'm sure this could be achieved without meddling with the simplicity of the rules. It's a shame the designer apparently has a too tight schedule to squeeze an expansion for GE.

I had a lot of fun with this.  Took us about 2 hours and 15 minutes plus a lengthy rules explanation.  Fairly easy to learn, and I like that it was a combat game without a whole bunch of little tacked on rules and exceptions.  The system was clean and fun.  The roles left me with lots of interesting choices, and it played out kind of like an economic/area control/combat hybrid.  The scoring is innovative and makes for a more balanced game experience than many combat-oriented games.

With 4 it had a nice push and pull to the combat, with no one really destroying anyone else.  I doubt I'd want to play with more...maybe 5 but certainly not 6.  It felt weird that the technology was gone so quickly, and I'd definitely make some different choices.  Would love to play again at some point.

Preordered. Arrived today 20/08/08. 
Fast-paced galactic area control game (in effect this is what it is). You makes Vp controlling sectors. The regent role is very smart, the battle resolution fast, the tecnologies a little bit confusing. 
The components are not the best i've ever seen (see money chits, sectors, helps) and ships are too large.

To be played again...
Edit: played again.
Sensations confirmed. Short (7-8 rounds), it changes with 2 special events (sun exploding and end of explorer), battles start in last 2-3 turns.

It certainly does feel like a streamlined version of Twilight Imperium 3. And, as such, it has rendered TI:3 obsolete for my purposes. I simply wouldn't ever choose to play TI:3 again now that Galactic Emperor is available.  Yes, alot of details are gone and with them, alot of theming. I'm perfectly fine with this. You may not be.

And yet, I have to admit that Galactic Emperor still isn't the 4X game of my dreams. When I think of space exploration, I think of the vast emptiness of space, and the thrill of discovering new worlds among an ocean of stars. Galactic Emperor feels like we're all jostling about in a crowded room.

A solid effort, and one that I'm happy to play. But not quite the space opera that I'd hoped for. In the same way that I'd always choose Galactic Emperor over TI:3, I wonder if I'll also always decide to go with Nexus Ops over Galactic Emperor.

More comparisons: It wasn't planned, but we played a game of Puerto Rico afterwards. All I could think was that it felt like a much tighter, streamlined Galactic Emperor. Seriously, the comparison renewed my appreciation for that classic design.

By attempting to cover both markets, perhaps Galactic Emperor falls between two stools.

Its interesting.  There's lots to do; the technologies are simple but cool and battles are exciting.  On the downside, its a 'whine' game.  To do well, you need to convince players to target someone else, which leads to a lot of arguing about who is in the lead.  The political phase would be neater if it weren't so lopsided towards people later in the turn; they CAN hose you if they choose.

Basically 'Twilight Imperium light', which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It shares (steals?) many of that game's mechanics and goals. Each player selects a role card at the start of the round and these allow you to perform various actions such as conquering sectors, developing technologies, producing materials etc. Victory points are then awarded to players based on how many sectors they've managed to colonize. It's an OK game but I think that anyone whose played Twilight Imperium will feel a bit frustrated with this game due to the lack of depth provided by the gameplay. On the plus side, it takes about four hours less to play, which is going to enhance its appeal somewhat.

28-Aug-08: After following the development of this for quite a while, I was pleased to see it at Milsims and bought it immediately. I mentioned before that I look forward to future implementations of Puerto Rico's role selection mechanic, and this is it. It has role selection, it has space ships, it has politics, it has exploration, it has technologies. The only thing I find lacking is the potential for the game to drag on and on if no one picks the Regent role (which drains the VP pool). Anyway, hopefully the designer will come up with a way to shorten game time.

19-Sep-08: Played my first 6-player game at Dockers. It handles 6-players pretty well, although there was significant downtime towards the end - one player managed to play a game of Puerto Rico between his turns! Game length: 120 minutes, with 25 minutes rules explanation. Some AP players on board. All in all, it dragged a bit towards the end (I attack you, you attack me, he attacks whoever is weakest, etc). If the game ended 30 minutes earlier, it might have been great. Perhaps reducing the VP chits by 30 would help?

How can you boil TI 3rd edition down to 2.5 hours? Answer: you can't! Because if you do, the result is something else but sure nothing in the likes of Twilight imperium. Galactic emperor is a good game for itself, that feels like a Vampire clone of TI 3rd ed. It sucked out all the life and soul of its bigger brother and is just unnatural. I could fit 4 sessions of this in the same amount of time as one match of TI 3rd. Still I'd rather go for that epic struggle. For those not willing to commit to the same standards Galactic emperor is a good - nay - might even be a very good alternative. It has a resource management and trade system quite different from my precioussss. I'm just a little biased since being a TI fanboy.

It's a little long and a great deal swings on controlling the group-think on exactly who gets picked on at what point in the game. Having said that, most of the game length controls are in the hands of the players.

Simplified Puerto Rico in space with plastic spaceships and conquest. Not a bad little area control powered victory point grab.

I love this game so much. So far only played once but it was awesome. TI3 minus 6 hours.

RATING: 5
First play was a three-way tie for first.  We missed the rule about the double planets on a tile being worth an extra VP, so if I'd been paying attention, I would have won.  This is another one of those resource/area control games that forces you to militarize at some point - which is the type of game I really don't care for.

Mix Citadels with Twilight Imperium and you get a better game than both of them. It is simple, it has nice components (dreadnoughts are impressive), it is well balanced (I was surprised with this since there 7 roles and plenty of different strategies). It is a great game that will please gamers looking for something along the lines of Twilight Imperium that ends in 2 hours. The game is unique on its own way, I am just using Citadels and Twilight Imperium to indicate what to expect). There is a lot of tension up to the end. Be prepared the first time that you will play it to spend 3-4 hours (6-payers) since you need to explain the roles, etc, but if all players know the game then a 4 player game can be finished easily in 2 hours.

I like!  It might be unfair to compare it to "the elephant in the room"--and I am evaluating it on its own merits--but it certainly scratched the TI3-lite itch quite nicely for me.

Initial impressions are high, even if the game leans towards Puerto Rico more than Twilight Imperium.  The time limit is right, and I find it interesting how political power is almost equal to military might.  A tight money system helps keep things interesting.

Got in trade. Game took a little longer than I had hoped to play, but it is still a manageable time, given it does give a real 'galactic conquest' with cool space battles feel. A big plus is that losing a battle doesn't make you feel like the game is over for you - you just build more ships and get back in the fight.

I didn't like that there were only 6 roles between 6 players after the black hole came out (in a 6-player game); the last player should still have a pick between 2 I think.  Other than that, it plays pretty well and was enjoyable.  I think this would be best with 4 players.

RATING: 6
For some people this will hit a sweet spot, but I was hoping for something more political, less military.  The first stage of the game, exploring the galaxy and expanding into new territory, is ok, though first impression is the role selection is more lenient than in Puerto Rico - i.e. no equivalent of being forced to ship, perhaps less opportunity to pick a role that benefits you only.  However, after a certain point there is nowhere to go and nothing to do but build ships and invade a neighbour.  This second stage reminded me of Risk and I anticipate the same issues: if someone is not attacked, they win, if someone is attacked by everyone, they lose, if everyone is attacked by someone, gains and losses tend to net out.  That's fine for those who like PR and Risk (I haven't played TI3), but it's not my thing.  Liked the art, though.

I've played once, and that was a very mixed-bag session.  The gameplay was interesting, but slowed down a lot by a combination of inattentiveness and analysis paralysis.  The session ended up taking three hours plus learning time, most of which I spent thinking "Can't we play [gameid=12493]?"  I'm not nuts about the role selection, as it doesn't feel as tight as it could be, but the combat, maneuvering, goods market, and influence were fascinating.  The game as a whole seems a little chaotic, but that's something I like.  I'm interested to try it again.

Knowing I hate this genre of games, I should have just sit out when my group decided to play this. The Euro bells and whistles don't save this from being what it is: a "build a bunch of units, turtle, and throw a bunch of dice when you fight" type of game, where the ratio of meaningful decisions to time spent is way too low for my tastes. On the bright side, this has solidified my conviction that I'm never going to try this type of game again, regardless of hype.

RATING: 5
I'm probably the flobbity-jillionth person to call this "Puerto Rico meets Twilight Imperium," but a rose by any other name, and all that nonsense.  It has role selection, warfare, and territory control, and the whole thing is set in space.  It's not a bad game, but it seems to wear out its welcome in a significant hurry.  I think a 3-hour playing time is just a bit too much for a game of this depth.  If it clocked in at the advertised 90 minutes, I might not mind playing it, but even if it did, I'm not sure that I would be clamoring to get a copy for myself.  It's interesting, but certainly nothing groundbreaking.

There's gourmet and there's fast food.  Each serve their purpose.  This one's on the fast food end but that's not a bad thing.  This is truly TI lite.  The $6 Carl's Junior burger.  It plays quicker than TI (1/3 the time) but retains the feel of galactic expansion.  It's a straight up 4X game but each of the X's is streamlined and without a lot of frills or background theme like you find in TI.  Meat, buns, cheese, and some dressing with a side of fries and a pop.  That's a good thing when you just want a filling burger on the run and don't want to sit down to a 7 course meal.  Thumbs up.  You get a juicy burger that will get you messy enough but cleans up easy.  The bun could use some sesame seeds, the soda's a bit watery, and the fries could be hotter but you'll feel full after the meal.

If the objective was to make the game a streamlined version of Twilight Imperium 3, the game is a success.  I don't like it nearly as much, but I'll play it way more often, as it has a similar feel and mechanics, and you can actually get this one to the table more than once/year. With a game under your belt, this game probably does clock in at aroun 90 minutes. 

I would not recommend this game for 3, as I think it takes longer than with a higher number.  The game clock keeps ticking as a result of taking the Regent role.  With 3, there is no driving reason to take the Regent or Warlord early on.  So, the game lasts a lot longer than I think it would with more people.

I don't mind long two-player games, but time-suck multiplayer 4X games (hello Twilight Imperium) will never be my thing.  Thankfully, [i]Galactic Emperor[/i] is the anti-Imperium.  It's clean, sleek, and respectful of my future dreams.  When I count down the number of hours remaining in my life, I don't want 20% of those hours to be spent waiting for other people to take their turns.

I do wish, however, that the author would have put more time into thinking about scalability. Since the board size doesn't change with the number of players, I wouldn't want to try [i]Emperor[/i] with more than four.

[b]RACE FT GALAXY ON A BOARD. WITH CONFLICT. AND DREADNOUGHTS.
RISK + PUERTO RICO + NEXUS OPS = GALACTIC EMPORER.[/b]
~PURCHASED 20/03/08 - AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO MYSELF~

Fall on your sword. Muhahaha!
I think that I would very much like to try and be a real Galactic Emporer, crimson robes swirling about me; widow's peak combed back into infinity; pointy, devil-like beard immaculately groomed; and a huge ruby ring on my bony finger - that whines and pulsates upon ruinous command, mesmerising all in my vaulted court (particularly bee-stung-lipped concubines).

This space opera Euro/Ameritrash game is really interesting. My rating is a placeholder until further exploration is completed. I am excited about this game, and want to love it, really I do; it just "feels" so fiddly. And takes too long to play.

The name of the game and box art inspires images of playing a character from Dune; the roles remind me of San Juan; the combat is Nexus Ops; the conquest element, and plastic spaceships, bring to mind Risk and Axis & Allies. In fact, GE also bears a favourable slight resemblance to that empire-building masterpiece Mare Nostrum. Unfortunatley GE is not as good as any of those games. Not one.

With the de-rigour role-selection mechanism, GE enables players to expand their Dukedoms in multiple ways, allowing power-crazed space-nobles the chance to seize the galactic throne through fair means or foul. If cash poor with few assets, unleash death and ruin with some dice rolls. If your space fleet is uninspiring, then use pirates, tech, or other nefarious options. Victory can be grasped by the Duke who best wields his forces and technologies, in a manner not forced upon you by a poorly-designed game.

The raw power of politics seems to have been addressed startingly well, with serpentine machinations within the galactic court a very viable alternative to orbital bombardments and stuffing systems with shiny battle-cruisers ready to unleash mega-death weaponry on opposing space-dukes. Both strategms are catered for here: Zap-zap, or chit-chat.

GE has a built-in timer gameplay element: the central Omega sun imploding and transforming into a remnant black hole. It's always nice when a game-feature is gloriously in keeping with the theme, such as it is here. After the sun dies, all new tech is banned, and the black hole allows fleets to jump across the galaxy. This spur can cause a drastic shift in player focus and tactics.

After playing, I did a swift poll of my group and the consensus was an okay game, not a great game, that was lacking something. Somebody shouted out "They took out all the fun!" Oh, dear.
I strongly believe that GE is missing a thematic keystone, something like player-specific powers or racial traits. The wordage in the game is also bland: Empires should be Colonies or some such. Each reduction in theme saws into the game's rating a half-point or so.

[b]HOW WOULD I IMPROVE THIS GAME?[/b]

1. Provide racial tech/powers/traits for each player.
2. Tighten the role selection by removing or combining some of the choices.
3. Remove the storage facilities.
4. Up the end-game reward for richest duke.

[b]EXPANSION IDEA:[/b]
Sun-killer tech - the ability to destroy planets! It might take a whole bucket of energy cubes, etc, but it would be worth any price to be able to reduce an opponent's planet to hot slag, and then send in an invasion fleet to his outer worlds, mopping up the rest of his forces.
How dare you defy me: your new Galactic Emporer!

ORIGINAL NOTE TO ADAM: Please do not change the theme to a funny, cheeky, family affair with smiling creatures, or rocket ships that look to be castoffs from Lost in Space.
Keep the purple board. Keep the cubes. Stick with your original idea. Do not let your compass be misdirected. Think El Grande; I love that game, but how much more would I love it if it had stuck to being about the Trojan War? A whole lot more, that's how much.
He seems to have stuck to his laser guns: the game appears close to the original design - as posted on BGG.

Too long and far too repetitive for me to enjoy.  The role selection and area influence mechanisms seemed completely out of place for a space combat game.  The turn order changes was the cause of many headaches since regent was almost always chosen.  Pretty much just an endless cycle of producing, building ships then fight, until the victory point chits run out.

RATING: 3
Completely derivative and uninspired, Galactic Emperor also has some turn order issues and problems with the range of players listed on the box.  I understand what the designer was attempting to do; make a 90-120 minute TI3.  He might have succeeded, but what's here just isn't fun.  At least, not to me.

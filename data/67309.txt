The game looks great, plays fine.

One thing I didn't like "so far" is that at the end of the game, I only feel that it's about the card you get and you keep trying to block your opponent and unblock yourself to win, it keeps going and going until one side give up.  I think this will get better in a game with more players.

{multiple plays • all 4-player partnership} Very fun... and still fun after many plays.  I'm a sucker for partnership games, but even without that predisposition, I'd prolly like this one.  There are just enough decisions to feel like you're playing, and just enough luck to not feel (too) bad if you lose.  Plus, the whole idea of trying to get rid of your chips is neat - it feels new, even though it's really just a "race" to end.  The best thing is that the partnership aspect is really solid (as opposed to feeling like an afterthought), and you are often confronted on your turn with choosing between something that would be good for you, something that would hurt your opponents, *or* something that might not be good for you but would set up your partner.  Having to get a sense of what your partner might want/need you to is really great... and then, even if you can figure that out and decide that it might be your best move, you still have to have the cards for it.  Very much like Dog, actually.  But much faster and a bit lighter.

Played one partnership game, and really liked it. I think partners is where the game is at. I went with the strategy of making a delivery anytime it was even worth one more chip than the opponents. It was really close at the end, and we pulled it off. The super-elegant and efficient use of cards is to be admired, and Ill be picking up a copy when it comes out.

Edit: Played some more, and I really like the partnership game.

RATING: 5
A fairly simple card game with some "take that" elements. There is some strategy, but it's mostly luck of the draw and guessing the best time to play a certain card combination. The partnerships game for 4p adds another way to play, but doesn't change my opinions about the game.

RATING: 8.96
Very Good filler. You gotta think ahead and figure out what to remove. The concept is there. I felt the rule book was a bit unclear. However I watch the video here on BGG which answered some questions I had otherwise pretty straightforward. Bump in rating there is alot more than meets the eye a really good game. Fun for the whole family. There is some luck to the draw. So it may turn some people off.

Clever card-pairing mechanic allowing a varied combination of actions. Unfortunately this game suffers badly from kingmaking. Whoever isn't targetted will have more turns to do something useful and therefore a better chance of winning. The theme doesn't come across well in the gameplay.

Light game. The gimmick is that you use 2 cards to create one action. I don't like the gimmick. I like the other gimmick which is that you can split your stack and serve 2 dishes at once. The game has some potential, but I just don't find it fun.

RATING: 7
Quick and entertaining, but way better as a partnership game with 4 players than with only 3. I like the hand and stack management aspect of this game where you can split stacks to provide more options on the table, but then you have fewer cards in hand to do stuff. This, combined with needing two cards (action + colour) to do anything, allows for some tricky plays and good planning. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players are running a restaurant, racing to be the first to serve their stack of meals out to the customers.  Simple card game where players play a pair of cards - one card in the pair denotes a colour, the other denotes an action.  Therefore ... "serve/green dishes", or "block/blue dish", and so on.  Serving serves the top dish of the matching colour off any stacks; splitting creates a second stack split at the colour played; block/unblock locks an opponents dish, preventing it from being served until it's removed.  Fun game, played in partnership, but tends to bog down into a block/unblock cycle, especially late in the game.  Still, the card pair play idea, and the stack splitting mechanic, are quite clever.  Easy to learn, and fairly fast to play.  Harmless.

The direct attacks are surprisingly important, but the game is about positive interaction and incentive  manipulation. There's a surprising amount of depth in there, though I think the variety is limited.

The poker chips are a bit embarrassing, but the fact that 4p uses partnerships indicates the game's solidity.

This is a fun little card game that can be played in 10 - 20 minutes.  Learning the game took us a bit but, once you learn the mechanics of using two cards as one action, it's quite simple.  As most card games, you're dealing with a lot of luck but, there's a good amount of strategy with when and if you should go after other players by covering their meals or if you should serve a meal with a busboy or just serve it straight out and risk allowing another player to serve as well.  Very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was extremely disappointed in this game.  I really enjoy partnership games and was excited to try this out.  The main problem lies in the take-that mechanism of covering other people's dishes.  I don't have a problem with attacks or aggression in games, but I dislike the "I do this, you undo it, I redo it", back and forth movement that ends up happening here (and in games like 1960: Making of a President).  I mainly find it frustrating, since at a certain point you're just going back and forth, covering and uncovering.  This is especially dissatisfying in the endgame, where it makes it seem like luck of the draw is a heavy factor in determining the winner.  I am sure that experienced players may disagree, but this is just how it appeared initially, and I think it will be difficult to get repeat plays to try to uncover any potential hidden depth.

There probably should be more variation on cards as now the situation is often such that there is a maximum of one good combination of cards to play on your turn. A nice mechanism though and the game is probably much better with more than two players. Partnership game could be interesting.

Played correctly, the game is interesting and fairly straight forward.  The stupid covers can be quite irritating if you constantly get stuck with them and can't draw cards to remove them.

Fun to play anytime.  Best with partners.  You can actually do actions to help your partners or hinder your opponents, which is very nice.  Even when you get behind you can work together to at least keep it competitive.

Don't underestimate your busboys and there are strategic decisions in which colors you want to play.

Also don't be afraid to discard and redraw if your cards are not working out.

Our group seemed to really not understand the card symbols and mechanics on the first game. It led to some frustration I think.  Neal and I seemed to understand what was happening though and thankfully we were on different teams.

Splitting your chips early is an absolute necessity.  Cashing in on serving during someone else's action is they key to the game imo.

The game was ok.. but it didn't super grab me unfortunately.  Willing to try it again though to see if the impression changes.

Excellent! This is a nice medium light filler, with a fresh new card mechanic. Combining 2 cards together creates different and strategic options. Splitting your stacks, all-serve, and using your busboy all provide you with a variety of play options...and it's fun! The components are great...from the nice card quality, stacks of food chips, and food covers.

A fast playing filler where you're trying to be the first to get rid of your 12 chips. Chips come in 4 different colours, same as the cards, and you start with the chips all in one stack. Each of the 4 card colours are not only associated with the chip colours, but indicate a different type of action you can do, so you play them in pairs - the first one indicates which action you're taking (eg split your stack, remove a chip, move a blocker, etc) and the second indicates (usually) which colour chip you want to action. So turns are easy and quick ... play a pair, do the action, refill your hand. Despite only having 5 or so cards in your hand (it changes depending on how many stacks you have) there's nearly always something useful you can do. The stack split function allows you to do multichip one turn discards to get a step ahead, and this function provides some scope for clever play using the cards you have to best advantage rather than just straight-forwardly trying to remove each chip in turn from top to bottom, where the colour cards you need next may not have magically appeared in your hand. There's some blocking on leaders you can do which can drag out the end game unfortunately, but otherwise it works fine for the 20-30 minute niche.

RATING: 6
Fun! Clever! Simple gameplay is slightly clunky until you get used to it, and then the games become quick. Game endings come in very close. This game is good with kids and adults, nongamers and gamers. Don't play this with just 2 players.

The rulebook examples answer many questions about the rules. The cards are quality, and the graphics are cartoonish. The meal covers are clever and thematic. 

The coarse dishes on poker chips have a good feel yet can be clunky especially during setup, but I think it's forgivable. The player help cards are cryptic and confusing. And thematically, blueberry pie nor soup doesn't do well with pizza.

Though I enjoy playing, this isn't a game I crave. Perhaps a reprint which can bring the graphics and pieces together with tighter coherency and style might sway me. This good game could be better.

Rulebook is a bit of an issue for a really simple game. Pick actions that allow you to server quicker. Try and mooch off others. The cards drawn dictate a lot of what you can do, but with the average hand size there seems to always be something decent to perform.

So far, so fun. I really like this one. We played with three teams of two, one deck, and eight chips apiece. It worked well. The only adjustment is that teams had to share a single set of bellboys which added a little extra with people trying to read whether their partner played a white card to use themselves in the future or to help set up their partner.

Cool card game; took a while to understand the rules -- they're a bit unusual -- but really it's not so difficult. The game moves along nicely once you've figured it out.

Each player gets 6 cards in hand, plus 1 card face down ("waiter"); divide "plates" (colored poker chips) randomly and evenly amongst players, each placing them onto their waiter. On your turn, play 2 cards using the right side of one to select the action (red = place stop a colored pawn on someone's stack; blue = split stack just below a colored chip; white = move colored busboy; green = discard top plates, all stacks, of a color), and the left side of the other to specify the color on which the action is occurring. If you split a stack, place one of your cards face down (= new waiter), pick one of your stacks, and split it just below a chip of the specified color; move top chips to new waiter. Your turn ends by drawing 2 cards. There is a bit more -- something to mitigate having someone play a busboy on top of your stack -- but that's the gist of it. The first player to get rid of all their chips wins.

You can also play it with partners: a more strategic game, but for me a bit too long; based on 1 play each with/without partners, I prefer the quick solo game.

Hey Waiter! is the first published design from Tichu fan extraordinaire Anthony Rubbo, and while it's not a trick-taking game, it is a game with tricky card play. Each player is a waiter trying to deliver his stack of dishes before anyone else, with the dishes being represented by a stack of colored chips on a face-down card.
\13\\13\
Players each have a hand of cards, a few of which might be special action cards while the majority will be divided into two narrow rectangles. To play these cards, the player chooses two cards and uses the right half of one card and the left half of the other. Thus with a handful of cards, each half of a card can be combined in up to a half-dozen ways. The cards let you take actions like moving a token from one stack to another, with the primary action being to deliver food. When you deliver a dish, however, everyone with that type of dish on top of his stack gets to deliver it, so ideally you can first place a token on the opponent’s stack in order to lock down that dish.
\13\\13\
You can also split your stack into two or more stacks, thereby giving you more opportunities to deliver dishes – but doing so reduces your hand size and limits the chances that you’ll be able to do what you want!

There are multiple great ideas orbiting [i]Hey Waiter![/i], but the game just isn't fully developed.  It's 70% done, but the missing 30% is critical.  Or maybe [i]Waiter[/i] was overdeveloped and oversimplified, since some playtesters seemed to enjoy the prototype better than the final version.

Either way, the joykillers are the dish covers that prevent players from serving dishes.  The issue is that the covers are entirely too easy to place and remove, which inevitably leads to annoyance and boredom.  (Place, remove, place, remove - [i]ad nauseam[/i].) The covers also turn the endgame into a painfully long kneejerk response, since everyone is forced to dump covers onto the person/team who is down to one chip to prevent that person/team from winning.

So, the dish covers need to be completely rethought. I'm hopeful that someone will propose a variant that rediscovers the fun within the game - since it deserves to be played in one form or another - but I'm not sure what the variant might be.  Possible avenues of research:

- Making the covers harder to place might improve things, but then you'd also need to make the covers harder to remove.

- The covers might be retooled so they affect everyone, and not just a single person. (An "active" cover would stop everyone from serving pizza, for example - not just a certain opponent.) Then players would need to cooperatively pool their cards together to remove the active cover.

- There might be a way to permanently remove each cover from the game, as the fact that they exist at all is a big problem mechanically during the final rounds of gameplay.

I dunno, though.  Creating nontrivial variants to save a $13 game really isn't my bag.

[Game gets a one-point bump for partnership play.]

 Okay, the poker chips could have been of better quality, but it doesn't make the game less fun to play.

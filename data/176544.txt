1st play: This game is the poster-child for exceeding expectations.  Looking at the art initially, and not recognizing the publisher, I came into this with no expectations.  Automobiles was not my cup of tea and Kanban looked needlessly heavy so I was prepared to not enjoy this one either.  What a pleasant game instead - the selling mechanic is fun, the car paths allow for flexibility and crunchy optimizations, and the changing priorities in the markets mean that you have to balance current turn goals with future turn goals, and knowing when to move on to the new trend.  Pimping out your cars and getting specialists to work for you are all good ideas too.  While the art didn't give me any expectations, it was very pleasant, upbeat, and refreshing.  Even though someone in my game group owns this, if it plays well at 4 as it does with 2 I might just have to pick it up.

2nd play: Enjoyed it the second time.  It played similar to the first time with some increased tightness due to 3p.  I'm looking forward to trying it with 4 as I imagine it gets even tighter.  It was harder to build the perfect car, but also more satisfying when you pull off a 16 point sale.  The art and design is still a big plus for me.

A surprisingly pleasant and polished worker placement game wherein you place workers on the edges of a grid which allows you to place a car on a ship to either the the US or European market AND acquire an upgrade to your car factory.  At the end of each one of the four rounds, players can selectively "transfer and sell" cars from the ships to limited "acquire money and/or victory points" spots on the board, with the order of this "transfer and sell" mechanic being determined by how desirable the car is to consumers in that market.

The game also adds what has become almost standard for every euro design of late:  special "contracts" to be fulfilled for victory points.  (Is fulfilling contracts really that fun of a mechanic such that it deserves to be in virtually every euro game?  I do wonder sometimes.)

Overall, a very nice game.  I can actually see how Automania might get more interesting to me in future plays as perhaps I take the opportunity to study the other players' car factories, then plan to go in different directions depending upon what they are doing with their factories.  On the first play, a four player game, I was simply focusing on learning the game, playing around with my factory, and earning VP's and money.  

Because the game is so short, with only four rounds of worker placements, I do have concerns about those players who go later in each round.  In particular, if a player goes last in the first two rounds of this game, it seems evident that this player will end up with very few of the optimal upgrades for their factory, seemingly making it virtually impossible for them to contend for the win.  

Accordingly, it may be close to essential in a four player game, for the player who starts the game last, to play the first round such that he/she "passes early" and jumps to first place or second place for the second round.  Simply put, going last twice may prove impossible to overcome.

Thinking about this issue with respect to this game, I am somewhat reminded of the game Carson City, wherein passing early in a round, and early in the game, is often essential for those who start the game lower in turn order.  In Carson City, however, when you pass early, you move your unused workers/cowboys forward as workers for the next round.  I missed that ability to pushed unused workers forward in Automania!  

As I see it, the designers of Automania were clearly aware of the "starting turn order" issue, and attempted to rectify the problem by providing BOTH extra VP's, and extra money, to the players who begin the game in the later positions.  Was this sufficient?  Perhaps.

Continuing on the issue of turn order in Automania, the game seems to provide no bonus (and a two car sale limitation) for those who choose to go first in the next round.  That seemed appropriate.   The bonus for going second, however, seemed a little too sweet to me- a free upgrade tile.  I would ponder merely allowing the person who decides to go second the ability to sell three cars, or four cars.  I might then shift the upgrade tile bonus down for those who bravely decide to go third in the next round, then provide the free contract for those who bravely decide to go last.

Very simple as far as rules go but offers some good decision making throughout the course of the game. Remains very competitive with 2 players. Can start building and competing on the very first turn.

At first glance I did not want to give Automania a try. Cute, cartoony artwork is not something that really interests me in  games unless it ties into the theme. But after i got bored one day and settled on watching Rahdo's Run Through of the game I decided that judging a game by its artwork might be a bit flawed. Automania is a worker placement game where you run a car manufacturer who makes $$$ and points by shipping cars over seas either to the US or Europe. Each round you'll get to build a car as well as upgrade your plant before shipping said cars across the seas to score at the end of each round. There's a revolving market that shows what kind of features the overseas buyers are looking for (safety, handling, speed, etc) that dictates what you'll need to do to score the best. Additionally contracts for certain types of cars can be acquired to score additional points. The game is smooth to play and while there are some decisions to make it is doubtful that AP players will get bogged down by the choices so a game of this can be knocked out in an hour or so. If you're put off by cartoony styling in game still give this one a try.

This worker placement game may be themed as automotive and factory, but it is a solid worker placement game.  The game is well balanced and rewards advanced planning.  It's not a brain burner, but it requires enough forward thinking that better players are almost certain to win out in the end.  There is not much catch up mechanisms, so a non-viable strategy will cost you.  This can be a real problem in longer games, but the timing on this game is well done.  Neither to short or too long.  It has a very solid and polished feel.  The graphics for the game components are easy to read and follow and actually reflect the game quite well.  This is a solid design worth playing.

RATING: 8.5
A fast, medium-light car production game with colorful, cartoon-like graphics. This is very often going to be compared to Kanban, perhaps rightly so, but it's just so much more accessible. I do like the graphic design more on its meatier counterpart, and the mechanisms there are quite good, but with this one I just feel as if it's bound to hit the table more, and it plays really smoothly. Go with this for casual or newer players, and Kanban when you've got the heavies involved. Both of them are roughly equal in terms of fun.

Initial Impression: When I first opened the box, I was underwhelmed by the components in this game. The cardboard tiles and money felt fairly thin and I almost tore a number of them while I punched them from the board. The box also had no insert, not even the sparse cardboard support found in many other games. However, the artwork and graphic design won me over as I introduced and taught the game to my family. Personally, I love the cartoony art style, as it makes the game seem approachable to the nongamer and semigamer. In the end though, this game is more than just a simple gateway game. There are many meaningful decisions to make and various paths to victory. Do you focus on one car type, one market, many managers, more workers, or many contracts? I like that fact that you can plan ahead by seeing what the markets will like three turns from now. However, you must also react to your opponents' choices and be able to change your plans instantly. After our first turn the rules and pace of the game fell into place and we were having a great time. I expect future games to play even smoother and faster.

Fun game overall.  Not a gateway game, but probably just one step up from that.  Everything about the game is really solid and fun, but it felt to me like it was missing one "thing" from being great.  I expect to play this a bunch more over the coming months / years, but I don't expect this to be a "5 year" game (basically to be relevant in 5 years).  Worth checking out if you like Medium weight euros for sure.

Many of the 9 and 10 ratings use the same word: Solid. 

Yes, it is solid. And it certainly should be. At this point every mechanism in Automania has been play-tested thoroughly in other games. 

There is absolutely nothing in the box that will not be extremely familiar to experienced gamers - from the 'worker placement/engine building tiles', to the 'optional-but-not-really' bonus cards, to the 'pass first to choose turn order which grants a bonus'... I could go on, but you get the idea.

This all sounds highly critical, but the sum total certainly works very well and is enjoyable. I don't think it deserves its current 7.70 average rating, which generally indicates something very special, but I do agree with the majority here: It is 'solid'.

RATING: 8
Automania is a fantastic game that ought to be a lot more popular, but I feel that graphic design choices steer people who would love this game away from it.  Even if you wanted to keep the colorful palette, I think even pixel art would have gone a long way to getting people looking at it.  Such as it is, nobody is talking about it and nobody's playing it, which is a shame.

While not without its flaws, Automania is a worker placement game that is a little bit heavier than you might expect with its cartoon stylings.  At first glance, it's easy to dismiss it as "Baby's First Kanban" (no similarities between the two beyond theme), but the combination of worker placement and jockeying for positioning on shipping boats gives each player some tough choices to make as the game progresses.  The theme shines through as each player will be attempting to push three types of cars through their assembly lines, picking up "star ratings" along the way depending on what upgrades they've placed on the conveyor belt.  How popular your car is determines what boat it sits on and later on, the order in which you get to sell them for points and/or money.  Of course, given that it's worker placement, even though you can bump people off their spaces, you can't stop people from taking the upgrades you want so you'll need to be able to adjust your strategy on the fly.  Despite this, scoring ultimately remains quite close unless you're really making terrible decisions, but that's on you, not the game.

Where the game does seem to be responsible, however, is in final scoring.  While I initially thought that the yacht spaces (in which you score 9 points for a super popular car) were unbalanced, getting to them is difficult enough that I think it's just rewards.  Contrast that to someone who simply doesn't spend their money and they get 10 points at the end of the game.  When your average point game is 1-3 points outside of the selling phase, a 10-point gain is insanely huge.

All said and done, I really enjoy this game and I'm not a typical euro gamer.  I know lots of typical euro gamers who would love this game, but won't play it because of its graphic design, which is a shame.  This is the perfect game to bring to a meetup or a game night and it's over in four rounds.  Get this game.  Play it.

Excellent mid-weight, thematic Euro. This game uses a number of mechanisms I like, for example, variable turn order (passing is a meaningful decision), face up "market" for bonus cards and an interesting worker placement mechanic. The advanced game allows for asymmetric starting "powers", which should add an interesting twist after playing the regular game.

Usually, I can find several faults after I play a game, but struggling here... just a really solid game. I'll give this an 8, with the possibility of going up, not sure it has the same depth as games I typically rate higher.

It's ... fine.  It doesn't feel all that unique, though I appreciate a new theme.  On that note, though, I feel like the artwork take me out of the theme.  It looks like a kids game, behaves like a 90m medium weight Euro, but really is no meatier than most family games.  The balance between money and points was a bit too see-saw for me.  I liked the building of the cars, but the criss-cross boards didn't really make sense thematically or otherwise.  I see what it's trying to do, though, I just don't care for it.  

At any rate, I'll not ask to play this game again, but it's inoffensive and even somewhat pleasant even if it's too long for its shallow decision space.

It is a really great game with little downtime and not too much thinking. Perfect complexity level for my taste.

In addition, the open market demands creates a good visualization of the dilemma whether to go for long term or short term strategy.

Das comichafte Aussehen von AUTOMANIA führt dazu, dass man es für ein  Familienspiel halten könnte, doch dem ist nicht so. AUTOMANIA hat es in sich und kann thematisch mit den Genrebrüdern AUTOMOBILE, KANBAN und KRAFTWAGEN was die thematische Umsetzung angeht, durchaus mithalten. Der Denkanspruch kann beim entsprechendem Spielertyp durchaus in die Grübegarage fahren. Und trotzdem ist AUTOMANIA ein leicht zu lernendes, flüssig fahrendes Getriebe, in dem spieldesigmässig nichts hakt und stottert. Einzig die Determinierung der Produktionsstrasse in der eigenen Autofabrik, die einen bindet, legt den Weg im Spiel früh fest, aber um wirklich zu maulen, ist das Spiel dann zeitlich mit seinen vier Runden dann doch zu überschaubar. Innovativ ist AUTOMANIA dabei nicht, aber dafür kann es das, was es kann, wirklich gut. Eine bessere unter meinen BGG 7/10.

RATING: 6
Automania is a game you might not necessarily be itching to try because the artwork is so... blah. Some have accused it of being too cartoony. Believe me: that is not the problem. Simply put, the artwork is flat, uninspired, and does negative zero to draw you into the game. If you have ever wondered about the effect that artwork has on your approach to a new game, see how you feel when sitting down to a game of Automania. You will wonder if you're playing a prototype version that managed to make it into a retail box.  That being said, once you get passed the insipid illustrations, what you have is a fairly light, but tight, worker placement game. It's light in that the decisions you make don't have a multitude of repercussions. In fact, no matter what you grab you are helping yourself in some way. I like games that don't punish you just because you didn't sit there AP'ing for 5 minutes on what your best move is. Sure, there are obviously some moves that are better than others (somebody's gotta win in the end, right?) but you don't feel particularly restricted by the design or by your opponents (though there is some light jockeying for position on the shipping boats). The game also starts off at a nice clip and keeps going that way until the end (which isn't that long; it's the perfect length of game actually). While there are a good number of decisions to make in terms of which tiles to take and where to place them, where to place your meeples, which cars to make and where to ship them, and so on, this is certainly a game that re-uses very well-established mechanics. The grid from which you take the tiles and the method in which you take them is the most novel part, but it's mechanical enough that it doesn't make sense from a thematic standpoint. Everything else though (from loading the cars onto ships and then sending them off to the local or international market) does make sense. I would say this game is too much of a re-tread in straightforward worker placement concepts that I don't see myself particularly compelled to play again any time soon. But I think this game works well for those looking for a very solid worker placement game that plays without issue with families or casual game times. It hits a sweet spot where you could very much teach it to a broad group of gamers and still feel like you're getting a meaty experience out of it. It's not easy creating a modern game for more than just hobby gamers that doesn't end up patronizing its players with randomness and brain-dead decision making. As such, I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone looking for the next level in worker placement games, but it's perfect for those who want a game that shows off to anyone who is willing to sit down some of the best established mechanics in modern board gaming today.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

Friend said this game was Kanban light and it definitely capture the feeling of a manufacturing line and shipping/selling. The building the cars part is not hard to do, it's the setup and getting a high star value and shipping/selling to the right markets. I think the only mechanic in this game that bother me a little was the last person catchup mechanic of deciding which car feature would be desirable next round. Seems a bit strong/random at first glance

This game is riding the edge of good optimization brain burn and unfun/work brain burn. I'm cautious of Kanban now if it's suppose to be heavier.

This game does a good job of filling the car production/selling niche for me without going heavier.

People would rate this game higher if they enjoy this genre of game. Personally it's not my thing but the game does play well

Automania may lack some of the complexity of other games in the field and the visual style may lead to it being overlooked by some but look beyond the paintwork and you will find a streamlined little runner that is well worth taking for a spin.

Not a fan of the "kiddie" art work but the graphic arts are done well in that everything is clear from icons right down to the backs of the tiles being different for easier sorting.

The gameplay is as advertised.  A euro about making the best points cars you can that satisfy contracts and that compete for sales.  All of this generates you points.  Jockeying for placement on barges and satisfying contracts is a rewarding puzzle.  Meduim light weight and quickly paced and finished for what it is.

Still wish for a rework of the art.. as I like the theme a lot..

Opinion: interesting game trying to improve your supply chain to your cards, but you have to adapt each turn to the demand on cars. With a lookout for children, you have a serious game, with some planning and different things to take into account, should I send my cars to sell now or wait for a bit more valuable ones, probably I should take that part to improve the quality of my cars...
Really interesting game with some goods decisions, do not focus on the aesthetics and think that this is a good game with quite some interaction

Automania is a worker placement that uses a grid to choose an appropriate action from a column/row. Its appeal comes from building an assembly line. It is a thoughtful game trying to align your factory's attributes with the desired qualities from each market. Automania is a well done game, but feels like what it is--an efficient assembly line. It lacks excitement.

Worker placement with no dice, a lot of opportunities to sabotage and interact with my oponents. Sure, you all have your own boards, and will barely pay attention to your opponent's boards, but the main game is played in the main one, and you can certainly get in ther way.
No dice, no luck, assymetrical abilities. A Great game.
May increase its grade as I play more.

Yeah, it looks silly and I would've ignored this title, if all you people didn't praise it as much. In fact this is a very decent mid-weight game with a good amount of different options. Everything works and it seemd balanced well. 

Even though I like deeper games, this one kicks "Kanban" in the nutz easily, as it's way more accessible and streamlined without killing it. Great stuff!

It's pretty light and fun, but in the long run it falls short. The only one action you can perform is actually produce cars. That's all. Some extra mechanisms instead of the Contract Cards could have improved the game. Also, due to the cartoon art, people think it's a kid's game (maybe is it?).

Don't be fooled by the graphic design, this is not just a children's game, this is a pretty solid light-medium euro. You have to plan a good amount for what should go on the overlaps of your assembly lines because these affect multiple car types. And I really enjoy how your action has you coordinating which type of car you want to make and which bonus tile you get which adds a necessary layer of planning and timing. But the fact that you have so few spots for tiles and they're freely replaceable made the game feel a little too tactical for my tastes. Nice game that's definitely more substantial than the art style lets on though still probably a bit too light for me to go looking for.

Don't let the terrible Facebook-esque art fool you- this is a great light game! Simple but good decisions are all through the game. It definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. 

It's a very different game at each of the player counts. There is very little blocking in a 2p game, but lots of blocking/extra moves in the 4 player game.

Could be a pretty good gateway+ game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

Since I heard about Automania, I always wanted to play the game but I’m not sure why. The original yellow box didn’t call to me and the second edition white box doesn’t either, still, I bought it and played the game and I liked it.

The rules of the game aren’t hard to grasp. I wish the rulebook was a bit better, but it does its job. You can explain the game under 7 minutes. Playtime is around 100 minutes. Automania doesn’t have a list of components on the box or the rulebook and that’s very bad for me. I don’t understand why they didn’t include it. I need it to verify if the game is complete after each play and it is very important if I buy the game second hand. I used to buy lots and lots of second hand games but since shipping increased a lot in America in recent years I couldn´t keep up with it so I now buy with free shipping from Cardhaus, MM or CSI. 

The art of the game is ok, I neither like it nor dislike it. The theme is ok as well, nothing too exciting.

The gameplay is very interesting and I wasn’t expecting this as the rules are pretty simple and straightforward. The game will last for four rounds and in each round you have to play an action or pass. Playing an action involves building a card (from three possible) or getting a contract card (hidden or visible). When you build a card, if the contract card matches the requirements you can play it. Every time you build a car you match its characteristic with a market in America or Europe and that gives you the quality of the car. The higher the quality, the faster you will be able to sell it. The action phase is very interesting because all players are competing for them and the tiles are in a grid, so when you choose an action you are also choosing a tile to place in your board. If a player played the action you wanted first, it will now cost you two workers instead of one and so on. In the sell phase, you will sell the cards you built and thus you will obtain money and VPs. The amount of cards you can sell is limited. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard, but they aren’t obvious either. The game has a lot of tension.  

Among the tiles you can get are: New workers for you factory, new machines for your factory or new styling tiles for your cars. They either give you quality or some other benefit.

After I read the rules I thought the game was going to be very simple, but I was surprised by it and I enjoyed it a lot. All my friends also enjoyed it. It shows that a game doesn’t need to be overly complicated to have interesting decisions. It has a light-medium weight.

There is considerable luck with the tiles and, most of all, the contract cards. I need to play more times to see if this bothers me or not.

Bottom line, Automania is a solid Euro game with easy rules but, somewhat, deep and tense decisions. I want to play it again soon and, for now, it is a keeper for me. I hope the game has a high replay value. Time will tell. It is a borderline 7.0 to me.

RATING: 7
The cartoony artwork belies the thinky character of Automania. Choosing from the central action grid can awake analysis paralysis to a degree that will turn this midweight euro into a tactical exercise feeling much heavier. It helps to have a strategic plan and focus on actions that help with this plan instead of trying to evaluate the plenitude of available opportunities. In fact, there are far less strategic avenues available than the tactical choices seem to suggest. Three types of automobiles, two markets with known preference structures for the next three turns. Enough information is available for informed decisions.

If the playing time comes down to the announced 60-90 minutes, Automania is a fine mid-weight game with a good mix of tactical and strategic elements. With this premise, I like it better than its two thematic competitors, [gameid=109276] and [gameid=171879]. My favorite game of car production will remain [gameid=39351], though.

I really liked this game. It's the lightest of a trio of games that are thematically related but otherwise, not: Kanban, Kraftwagen, and Automania. This is one is the most fun. The cutesy artwork might put you off, but make no mistake, there is engine building, strategic short- and long-term planning, and a little bit of shutting out your competition going on here. Best game of the night for me! (Food Chain Magnate, Treasure Hunter, Sheep and Thief, and Royal Goods were the others).

2015-10-13 - 8 - Medium weight euro game about car factories. Really straightforward game, quite quick (hour, maybe a little bit more), not too complicated but with meaningful choices and quite strong competition. The artwork is maybe not too beautiful, but I like it - it's clean, bright and is a little bit similar to the PC game Theme Hospital.

2016-05-24 - 8->9 - One of the best games to play with non-gamer, when you want to introduce him/her to gaming and play some serious no-filler title at the same time. On the other hand you can play it with gamers only and have a great time too.

Nagyon érdekes, egyedi játék, izgalmas mechanizmusok keverednek benne.

Sok dologra kell figyelni, az autógyártás jelenlegi/jövőbeni igényeinek alakulására, az akciólehetőségekre, a célkártyákra, stb., sok a döntési lehetőség, az biztos. Szívesen játszom még vele.

Play Three times with 2P.
The rules are many,  but not hard to understand.  The games look very simple,  but because the tiles are random,  it could gives you a headache if the tiles for that round are not good.  Plays well with 2P. If there will be a mini expansion I hope it will be the factory components,  to add more randomness. 

Play once  with 3 P the game become more interesting because we block each other


Final word: a keeper for me because its fun and easy but quite deep

In Automania, you run a car factory, trying to produce the most popular cars in the market. To achieve this, you buy tiles to upgrade and customize your factory, and hire specialist employees to help you.

Central to the game are the factory boards: Each player has a factory with three assembly lines, and each assembly line produces one type of car. You can put machine tiles along your assembly lines to change the specifications of your cars. However, your three assembly lines intersect, so each machine tile placed might affect more than one type of car — which means you have to think carefully about where you put those machines.

Automania is like a hybrid of Kraftwagen and Quadropolis. You select tiles from a common grid in much the same way, and then place them on your personal player board to make an assembly line of parts to make a car. (Kraftwagen mechanics are more of a straight euro style to get parts and then use them... no puzzle aspect.) Both car games have additional, but differing, layers of selling the cars. And Kraftwagen also has you race your cars, which Automania does not.

Overall, I like Automania better than both Kraftwagen and Quadropolis. I liked Kraftwagen when I played it, but thought the replayability over time might suffer. Automania seems like it can last since there is a lot of variability. Despite the cartoony artwork of Automania, it's definitely a brain burner to figure out the puzzle of selecting your car parts, multi-car assembly line, how best to score your bonus cards, and how best to sell your cars to either the American market (focus on money) or the European market (focus on victory points) via strategic placement on ships. A lot to keep track of. I recommend Automania.

SUPER smooth game play. Straightforward, no fiddly rules, the game is as clear and distinct as the art itself. Plays very well at high player count as the worker bumping and returning of workers to opponent makes great interaction. Everything aspect of the game hits a perfect balance: tension, interaction, available decisions, catchup mechanic.. even game weight feels like the happy medium between a crunchy Kanban and the lightest filler game you own. Cannot wait to play it at 2p.

Good Euro style game that has a mixture of mechanisms I enjoy in the rare contemporary setting. I don't particularly enjoy optimizing the cars for the fluctuating requirements, at least not as much as I thought I would.

I want to play this more. I really like some of the unique mechanics to it and the conveyor belt 'engine' is cool. I'm not a petrol head at all. But really enjoy this theme and here it feels really well placed in the setting.

I just want to play it a little more as I've only played it 2 player.

Automania doesn't really reinvent the wheel, but it does a few really interesting things with tried-and-true mechanisms that create a very satisfying experience. In many ways, this feels like the perfect next step above a gateway game. You have to calculate points for cars, but aside from that, I don't think this is any more complex than, say, Lords of Waterdeep. It does bug me a little bit that there is only one path to victory, but the game is tight and fun, even if the art makes it look like a kid's game about cars.

UPDATE: Maybe my tastes have changed, but this one doesn't have the magic it once did. I think it's a very clean and efficient design, but not a particularly engaging one.

Baby Kanban...Kanban for Dummies...Son of Kanban...whatever you want to refer to it as -- this game is still a bit of a brain-burner, which really only tells you how stupid you feel for playing something of the insanity of Kanban.

For mere mortals, this game is super fun. Mechanically, it's a really good blend of Goa-like tiles arranged in a grid that are fought over, mixed with the worker placement cleverness of Keyflower (except they're not "auctions" technically).

This is the poster child for the old adage, "don't judge a book by its cover" in that the artwork completely belies the depth and weight of the game. It is most certainly NOT a game for kids. Still, the artwork and visual language are without fault for the games complexity.

This came over as a pretty decent affair. Funnily enough, it reminded me of a far-simplified Die Macher - looking ahead to plan what policy aka car feature was going to be popular in the coming years, and building your party platform aka your car factory to match. I like how you could use spare meeples to amp up the points for a car you've just built. It was nice how the game led the factories to diverge, providing choices between managers (global powers), accessories (for a specific car make), and features (which multiple makes could share). And there's the perpetual choice required on when to take money and when to take points. A bit too much analysis dragged our first game out a bit, but with experience hopefully that would lessen to a more suitable timeframe for what is a very Euro game. I liked the old-game-school art feel.

RATING: 7
In this game, you place workers on the edge of a tile gid, take a tile, and the resolve the action on the board. Most of these actions produce a car that's given a star rating according to the upgrade tiles along the path the car follows on your player board. The star value determines which boat spot the car is placed on. At the end of the round, the boat spots convert to dollars and points, with the players who had the highest value selecting their spots first. The game also has objective cards that reward you extra points for completing certain types of cars with certain upgrades. As the game progresses, the tiles get better, and the star value of the demands shifts.

It's a very cute game that hums along the whole way as players try to make the most efficient use of their workers and maximise their efficiency between tiles and cards. The game could absolutely use some dice so that players could easily tell what the star value of producing a car is at any moment, both for your own brain's sake at having to recalc everything, and so that you could see when another player is about to block you from taking the spot you want, but that's a minor quibble.

RATING: 9
Such an appealing visual design, that is very thoughtfully language independent. The iconography might be the best I have ever seen in a game that has this many moving parts in gameplay. You play the role of an auto manufacturer, and you are overseeing what features will be added to your cars by placing those features on your production lines, and staff to oversee your production plant.  You then have workers to place to acquire more features and to send a car on the production line to be finished and shipped to market (literally on the boats). So you earn money and victory points by being the best at managing your money and how popular your products are.

RATING: 7
This is a medium weight worker placement game that offers some great decisions. I really feel like I am producing cars and selling them to the right market. The theme and the mechanics are beautifully meshed. The only problem with this game is that it requires a constant back and forth from different areas of the main board and player board. I constantly forget multiple parts of my 8 point plan before I take one action. I am no where near an AP player, but this one almost does it to me. If someone is AP, this could be bad news for the group. By the time I finish this game my head always feels heavy. I feel like I am working pretty hard at this game. At first I rated this a 9 and absolutely loved it, but I have kind of cooled on Automania after playing more worker placement games. They just flow a little better for my thought processes, and I don't feel mentally exhausted after playing them. Still a solid game though, with a cool theme. **Wife:8

Alter your assembly line. Crank out some cars. Adjust demand. Repeat. The whole process if very simple, but the player interraction makes this kore interesting. Racing to get the parts you need on an action grid that may or may not be laid out in your favor, while simultaneously trying to take your time and build the best car possible so you can claim the top spots in the market. Knowing when to settle for money or grab some points can be tough. Overall, the cutesy aeshetics are hiding a game with some real decisions. It's not a heavy game, but if you were like me and went in expecting a family gateway game you might be surprised.

I enjoyed this; it's a bit different from the rest of the herd of worker placement games. Strong on theme, too - I like the way that you are actually regularly producing new models rather than painstakingly assembling something once every turn or so as in some games. It's a bit like a much less fiddly Shipyard, but a lot more fun than that game, Kanban or Automobile. I played once with two, but would expect the fun factor to be considerably higher with four players, and the rating may rise.  I have to say though, I'm not really a fan of cartoon art in games.

I tend to approach car-building games with a bit of hesitance since my first one was Automobile, which I was extremely meh on.  This one surprised me.  Hidden under the cartoony, but pleasant, art is a very nice game that forces you to make tough decisions.  Everything integrates seamlessly and is very approachable.  My only gripe is probably that, for me, it's probably a 4p-only game as there is no artificial board-tightening with less players, but that's a minor nitpick.

The game has very cartoony art but it is not at all a light kids game. It shares a theme with [thing=171879]Kraftwagen[/thing] and [thing=109276]Kanban[/thing] -- make cars, sell them -- but with very different mechanisms and a bit lighter than either of those. This is a worker placement game, with players each starting with a bunch of workers in stock. There's a grid that is filled with actions at the start of each round. On your turn you place n+1 workers above a column or left of a row (n=number of workers already there; those go back to owner), then take a tile from that column/row and execute the action. Actions allow you to acquire factory upgrades, hire workers (who modify other actions), build cars, acquire contracts, etc. When you build a car, you tally it's popularity based on the kind of car built, the improvements in its pathway on your factory board, how the car attributes match with those in demand for either the US or Europe market (tiles drawn at random at the start of the game). Cars are immediately loaded onto boats, and may score some VP if popular enough. You may also be able to score a contract if the car you built meets its requirements: set the card aside for endgame VP (some earn immediate cash). At the end of the round, score the US and European markets separately: the most popular cars are sold off the boats, earning players VP rewards. The player who ends up in last place can exert a bit of control in how the market demands will change the next round. After __ rounds, the game ends and all cars still on boats sell for a minimum VP value; most VP wins!

Fun game with interesting decisions about which action to choose (in a Targi-like way), how to upgrade your factory, when to sell cars vs waiting for a future round, etc. I just wish the art weren't so childish!

A smooth, elegant game with plenty of tough decisions to make in a  relatively short amount of time. While the artwork is a bit garish, the game is certainly eye catching to a passerby.

Update: 5 months after the release of the 1st edition, a new and improved 2nd edition is being released with possibly some support from the publisher for those of us with the 1st edition. My original rating may go up or down depending on how this turns out.

Super short, only 4 rounds.  With the length being what it is and the tiles in the middle of the board being replaced each round, the planning of this game is pretty reactive.  You have a bit of long term planning seeing what each side will want in the next few rounds, but that is then limited by the tiles that actually come out.  Also with the Americas and Europe having different selling/scoring tracks, you might get pigeon-holed based on what you've already taken.   I think this would be a good game for casual gamers you are trying to get into something a bit heavier, but not too heavy.

tl;dr: strategy game in disguise

This game is deceptively heavy. Judging from the artwork and the fact that the board looks like 1/6th of the [thing=109276][/thing] board, makes you think that this will be a lighter strategy game. The rules are also quite straightforward.
But once you start playing, you immediately notice that choices are hard. You need to choose what strategy to pursue, but which one is the best, and how to best achieve it?
We where all pleasantly surprised by this game. The fact that scores where very close just helped making all of it very enjoyable.

Only played once, but this is probably the simplest of all the car building games I've played (Automobile, Kraftwagen), but still has some good decision making opportunity. Only gripe of the game is that the graphics mismatch; it looks like a kids' game, but it definitely is more meaty than that. That being said, the graphics are very functional and everything is easy to understand. Have to determine how the luck of the draw affects the game.

RATING: 6
Solid, fairly straightforward worker placement game with a low amount of luck involved. You build cars to get points, while improving your factory by acquiring new tiles. This allows you to make even better cars. Money is tight and you have to balance going for points versus going for money.

I don't really have anything negative so say about the game. However, there's nothing exceptional here either which is why I don't rate the game higher. Recent worker placement games like Shakespeare and Steam Time get higher ratings because they either perfect the worker placement formula (Steam Time) or offer some new twists (Shakespeare) on the genre. Automania, on the other hand, is just completely average.

Sold.

My friend Ron had raved about this game... which was good, because the art might have scared me away otherwise. The game looks like a kid's game. Whoever did the design did this game a disservice as there's a disconnect between the art style and the target customer.

The game is about building cars for selling to the American (money oriented) and European (quality/vp oriented) markets. Both markets have a set of demand tokens that rotate through a cycle. You know what current demand is, and most of what the future demand will be, but there's always a little doubt about which of two future demands will cycle through or not.

You have a pool of meeples which you allocate to spots on the board that give you tiles and trigger an action. When you place meeples, you have to put one meeple more than is already in that spot, kicking the other player's meeples home. Then you take a tile from the row (or column) you're in and finally do the action that you placed your meeple on.

The tiles come in three types, managers - who give you some bonus, styles - which you assign to your car types and are permanent bonuses, and machines - which you assign to stations in your factory and help you meet the customer demand (but can be switched out if they cease to be valuable).

The actions are to build your economy car, family car or sportscar (which are progressively more expensive) or to take a contract. Building a car means you pay the cost of the car (1, 2 or 3 bucks) and then send it to the American or European market. Which machines it passes on your conveyor belt determine which demands it can satisfy. You check the market you are sending it to and it gets "stars" for how well it meets those demands... and stars for stylings and managers. That determines the order it is placed in the market to sell as well as how many bonus points you get for it immediately. You can augment the car and spend workers to give it extra stars.

When taking a contract, you can take one of three face up ones or a random face down one. These give you points if you build a certain type of car meeting various conditions.

After you've taken all your actions for a round, you pass and select a turn order spot for the next round, which comes with some bonus. After everyone passes, the cars are sold. Generally, everyone can sell at least two cars. Some of the turn order spots and some of the managers give you the ability to sell more. When cars are sold, the ones with the most stars sell first, which is important as they get to take a bonus spot when they are sold giving points or cash. The spots get progressively worse, so selling first is an advantage.

After two rounds, a new set of tiles are used which are better than the starting tiles. After the fourth round, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.

The game is fairly straightforward, but in a good way. I really liked the machine factory placement where one machine placement upgrades different sets of cars in your factory. This game wasn't the most complicated game, but it did what it did well. I really enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
Automania's design harkens back to the good old worker-placement days. Here, the theme is producing cars and players attempt to assemble cars that fit the market needs. There are multiple criteria that the market desires and the more needs you fulfill, the more highly rated your cars and the more money/prestige you gain by the end of the game.

The game lasts for 4 rounds with players making and shipping cars each round. Worker placement allows players to pick up personnel, car accessories and parts to enhance the overall rating of the cars. Players then jockey for market accessibility based on their how their cars rank in the market. The highly rated cars will have more options in choosing between money and prestige. 

Overall, the game is quick. Unlike other games where engine building take center stage, Automania forces player to produce cars from the first action onwards. Cars leaving the assembly line will be ranked poorly in the beginning but will slowly improve over time. This feels fun. Rather than sitting around optimizing and building one or two super cars, every gets to make good and crappy cars each and every round. Though nothing new,  I particularly enjoy the worker placement grid.

Components of the game look fine if you into cartonnish art, which I happen to think is appropriate.

This is the kind of Euro game I like, maybe a bit on the light side, but still a lot of tough decisions and planning to do.  There are a lot of my favorite mechanisms worked into the fluid gameplay of Automania, things like bumping other people's workers to make use of the column they've already used, dropping out early to get a turn advantage in future turns.  Fulfilling orders to guide your strategy.  It's a solid, medium to light weight Euro.

Update: To my surprise, while I liked the game quite a bit when playing it, I haven't felt any need to play it again.  I think it's a great sort of entry-Euro, but at this stage in my gaming not really something I'm anxious to play I guess.

Gateway euro economic simulation of the auto manufacturing industry.  Uses many familiar mechanics in a good way. Draw and select personal objectives (e.g. Build an 8 star economy car with good handling for 2 VP's). Individual player board factories. I like how the three factory lines intersect to leverage the benefit of factory upgrades. Push out a worker to re-use that occupied space. I like the incentive to early round passers for advantage in the following sell cars phase. Sell your highest value cars first in the round end draft into the US or Euro market for cash/VP's.

I like Stone Age and Pursuit of Happiness quite a lot and thought I would this too but after a couple of plays it hasn't clicked yet. It feels a tad boring and unintuitive.

Or maybe I should stick to heavier euro/worker placement games as I worry that other mid weight ones I have my eye on will feel the same and would disappoint me.

While it's not a child's game, I don't want to spend 2 hours playing something that's 2 eyes away from having its own Disney movie.

Worker-placement game where you make cars to send to US or European market to earn points or cash, or possibly both. Improve your cars star levels to get better points.

Car making game similar in scope to Kraftwagen but easier than automobile and kanban. 

Its alright, plays fast. Little downtime; start making cars straight away, no messing about.

I am confused to whether car ratings score multiple times as i do not find it clear in either the rules or game play.

Regardless, its a good game.  Though I do not intend to keep my copy.

A reasonably clever worker placement game about manufacturing and selling cars.  Hampered by poor production values.  My three car types all look the same, the player boards aren't big enough for some functions, and the art is worse than most prototypes I see these days.

This is a blast! It has a cool theme which is implemented well without getting bogged down in an attempt at realistic simulation (it's a game!) and the feel I get during play is spot on. I love building up my factories, making and delivering the most profitable cars, hiring the right characters, all of it! 

Highly recommended to lovers of mid-weight management games.

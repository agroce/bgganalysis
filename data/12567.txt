RATING: 9
Makes my top 3 for East Front Corps/Army level games for a class conter/hex game.  Has lots to commend: great graphics, fast play, lots of tough strategic/operational decisions.  I always like step losses.  I have one critique, the CRT is a bit bloody and I found I could eliminate the Russian by frontal attacks and did not need to employ operational encirclements.  Still a tight, tense, balanced game.

I have played two complete games of RB. Very much enjoyed the experience and would gladly play again. I played as Germans in both games - lost the 1st one badly, and won the second one in '43. Russian opponent needs to be ready to take a beating for the 1st two years (as with all Strategic WW2 East Front Games)and the German player needs to be aggressive. Great experience in the tradition of classic board wargames.

Solid game.  Nearly a Russian Campaign clone but with extra chrome (generals, more detailed air etc) and, most importantly, fixed supply rules!  The graphical presentation is good but not quite up to usual L2 standards.  Lots of errata is made better by stickers that can be pasted over the offending rule/chart/map (yes there is erranta on it all).  The standard game has 1/2" counters but you can request the updated, errata free, 9/16" ones.  The graphics on the larger units are still generic Nato symbols and not the tank profiles of TRC.

RATING: 7
Good, solid game.  I had a choice between this and L2's Russian Campaign remake, and I think I chose wisely.  In many ways, it is Russian campaign "grown up".  Only the playing time issue keeps it from being an 8 Rating for me.

Souped-up successor to The Russian Campaign.  Same concept, but lots more chrome and more up-to-date research.  A production issue caused the game to ship with an unproofed rulebook -- as of January 2008 the revised rulebook is undergoing final revision for release hopefully soon.  The errors in the printed book (and on the box cover) belie the amount of effort that went into the design.

Great game with excellent quality.  This is somewhat more complicated than The Russian Campaign, because of the extra chrome and rules, which in my opinion makes the game a lot more exciting.  I had heard of the quality of L2 Games but I had to see it to believe it.  So far I have played twice, both solitaire.  The issue was in doubt until the very last in both games.  After purchasing and playing this game it inclines me to buy other L2 Design Games such as Bitter Woods or one of their upcoming games.  I would definitely recommend this game to veteran and novice players alike.

RATING: 8.5
Essentially a major revision of 4th ed. Russian Campaign.
Major tweaks to rules about rivers, replacements, and major cities.
Units are generally a little stronger and faster;
 map is nearly identical. except for unused Southeastward 
 extension, which makes possible some planned variants.
However, map has been expanded to accomodate 5/8ths counters, 
  which i think come with later editions of the game and can 
  be purchsed separately -- original edition has 1/2" counters.
If you own a paper copy, you can PbEM via an AdC2Lite disk ($26),  
  available via the Website of the game's publisher (L2 designs).
  (If you buy it, i need an opponent!)
"Living Rules" online are not quite complete -- you need 
  a copy of the original rulebook for some details.
In many ways, this game captures the spirit of the Russo-
  German front of WW2 well -- the Axis has a lot of fun 
  early and has snazzier forces, but the plodding brute 
  force of the Red Army wins eventually.

OK, I am biased.

What is special about Russia Besieged?

This is a Corps Level game that covers the entire war on the Eastern Front, 1941-1945.  The order of battle is substantially improved over some of the old favorites that have come and gone over the years.  Russia Besieged (RB) was modeled after the Russian Campaign (TRC) in some ways.  

It uses roughly the same scale.  The difference is the map extends from Finland to southern Russia, Persia, Iraq and Turkey and a variant is in the works for Turkey, including die cut counters.

Similarities between RB and TRC are subtle.  The Russian economy in Russia Besieged is based on OIL WELLS and WAR ECONOMY COUNTERS.  Oil points allow you to build ARMOR.  WEC allow you to build infantry.  A combination of  an infantry army and a mech corps plus some OIL POINTS gives you a SHOCK ARMY. 

There is a Lend-Lease chart based on Archangel, Murmansk and Tabriz (in Persia).  If an route from these three cities is blocked, there is a reduction in foreign aid points provided to Russia from the Western Allies.

Terrain in Russia Besieged is also handled differently than TRC.  Units can move through terrain such as Swamp, Mountains, Forests etc by paying movement costs.  In TRC, you have to stop, when entering some terrain.  Also, Rivers in RB flow along the hex spine, in TRC they cut through the middle of the hex.  Units in Major cities do NOT have to attack units adjacent to them.  This eliminates the taking of a city by SMOOTHING it.  In TRC, you could soak off against the city and attack a weak unit next to the city at high odds, leaving a very large stack next to the city after combat, thereby forcing the defender, in his turn,  to ATTACK at bad odds to remain in the city or retreat.

Not so in RB.  Units in the city are never forced to attack out.  This allows you to simulate sieges, similar to Stalingrad.  Units are never forced to leave a city on an attack that calls for a DR or a D1 etc.  The defender can always take an additional step loss and remain in the city!

You do not have to attack units you are adjacent to, if they are separated by a River in RB.  Also, the game makes use of Dice Roll Modifiers for things like terrain, Armor versus Infantry in the clear, Field Marshals etc.

Bombers are handled in a very unique way in RB.  9 Stuka and 2 Illiushin Bombers are included, each with an airbase counter.  Bombers shift the odds column by one in the attack.  A bomber can either fly a combat mission in an impulse or stage to another city closer to the front.  The airbase reflects prepared airfields, flight crews, supplies, fuel, bombs etc.  You can fly out of range from your base and land in a city with no airbase, but in order to fly again, your airbase must stage to you first before you can fly the next combat mission.  

All counters in the game have step reductions and replacements come in the way of points.  This allows your armies to take a beating, but still remain on the board, reflecting a wearing down of your army over time and extended combat.  Units are printed with information on both sides of the counter and flip when a combat loss is taken.

The CRT is based on a d10 die.  Results are called for in terms of steps.  A D1 means a 1 step loss and the defender must retreat 2 hexes.  An A2 means the attacker loses 2 steps and retreats 2 hexes.

There are also a large number of variant counters included in the game.

Other rules of interest are rail conversion rules, factory evacuation, National Leader evacuation, Blitzkreig attacks on a separate CRT, weather rolls, and more.  If you like EAST FRONT, WWII games, you really have to take a look at this game.  It is the whole package and some.  It is easy to learn and hard to master!

Play time.... 4 hours to 24 hours for the whole campaign game.

Interested:  Download the latest version of the LIVING RULES and see for yourself!

Wondering about support for rules questions?

Russia Besieged has its own forum on Consimworld where the enthusiasts get together to discuss the game, tournaments etc.

http://www.consimworld.com

Look under Eastern Front: WWII games

There is also an ADC2 professionally made Module for the game AND and ADC2 Lite module that is available that includes a SELF RUNNING copy, if you do not have ADC2 software!

Well also ran a hugely successful WBC tournament last year and will continue to support the game!  Currently, there is an ongoing BPA tournament with global entrants playing by ADC2 software.

One last thing, the components to this game are awesome, check them out in the posted pictures!

Hope this is a helpful review.

Enjoy!

Good: Strategic/Operational - Eastern Front - Easy/Medium

Plus:
-Good design based on the Russian campaign but actually different in play.
-High quality components. Functional map & counters 

Minus:
-Very steep price
-No scenario's!! This is actually a big let down.Now they come with an expension but I am sorry to see L2 is going this way. Honetly, for an 80 Euro I think the game should have least included some scenario's. 
-Map & counters are functional but graphics are average (would have loved to see Bitter Woods style map)
-There is only one scenario and this really is an issue for me; you can only play Barbarossa.

Overall: good game but I am disappointed that there are no scenario's, which hampers the game tremendously in its replay value. Only now there is an expansion available and this upsets me as it should have been there in the first place for a game that cost 80+ Euro...

Ordered this game to replace the beautiful but unplayable Barbarossa: the Russo - German war. This is playable and a revamped version of the classic: The Russian Campaign. I guess I prefer the Russian Campaign. 
Really a shame as this would have lifted it to the perfect Russian Front game of all time. 

Another disappointment is the dominant presence of Turkey on the map but unfortunately it does not play a role whatsoever. Update: you can pay for the expansion of course.

Don't get me wrong this is a beautiful game but quite expensive for what you get and it feels like there are missed opportunities.

Good game but disappointed as there are no scenario's and I gladly stick to EastFront II

Sold it.

Great game, downloaded the Living Rules and new charts and I have been taking the game through its paces.   The new rules rock.  At a glance, the new changes have greatly leveled the playing field and the German now has a much better chance of lasting longer in the game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the Eastern Front and especially, if you are a Russian Campaign fan.  Move on up! Best corps/army level game on the market.

The first time I played this game I was the Russians.  I won by the end of '42 by Sudden Death - the German player just couldn't get beyond 13 Major Cities.  The second time I played it the German player blew away the Russian defenses the first turn, took Riga that first turn, and the game went downhill from there.  So, it can't be said that neither side has a chance to win.

Pretty like an "advanced" version of "The Russian Campaign", as Advanced Third Reich to Third Reich.  I'll consider this game because this is not just the graphics update of an old game, it built on a proven game engine instead and become a game on its own.  Also, you can always enjoy L2 game production quality.

RATING: 7
Very Nice game. Very good OOB. The 1941 gameplay does not seem to reflect the historical German advances. The depiction of the Leningrad area does not seem to work too well. Besides my own "No Retreat!" and Lou Coatney's "Sturm Nach Osten" it is my favorite East-Front game: BUT I am using extensively modified house rules. VERY often the standard game is decided in 1941 in the German Favor because of the weather die rolls: use fixed weather. The colors chosen for the game's components are not optimal.

This is definetely much better than TRC. Rules are much deeper and more intelligent and realistic. The map is gorgeous. I did not rate more than 9 because RB is much longer than TRC for my personal taste (right now I'm lucky enough having found a temporary place where to leave the game!), even the on line latest Living Rules have something incorrect and there is no shoorter scenario than the entire campaign. I would really like to see soon several scenarios. I would to add anyway that Art is answering my questions immediately and this is very very much appreciated.

Another beautiful L2 game. L2 is rapidly becoming the caviar of wargame companies, featuring top of the line graphics. The map is sort of like The Russian Campaign on steroids, with extra large hexes, and the system is like a more advanced TRC, too. I'm in the process of playing the game solitaire now, but it looks good so far. One point demerit for not having the simplicity of TRC-- this one is a little fiddly, although it attempts to add a little more detail in the process. I still think TRC nailed the sweet spot for this type of game. Adding more detail just isn't worth the additional rules, IMO.

RATING: 10
Fanstatic game. This is the final touch game for all those Russian Campaign enthusiasts. This game has  totally corrected anthing which the previous editions of Russian Campaign may have brought down the consumer. Once you master the Russian Campaign game your next logical step is step onto this game, you will never regret it. Better mapboard, far accurate replacement & reinforcement rules, better movement system for terrain & better combat results table. In every single respect the rules for this game inclusive of the optional rules is excellent. I only play this game with the optional rules included to have further in depth essence. Good optional rules & very much entertaining. This game will always remain in my inventory collection. This game is greatest link between Russian Campaign & Russian Front 1941-44. Matter of fact once i got access to this game, I simply put Russian Front on the collection shelf for display only.

Russian Campaign with bells and whistles. Although they should have waited until they had it right. too much errata and stickers yuk! for counters and map. Would have liked siloutes but then I suppose it would be Russian Campaign in a different box. I like the Russian Campaign just as much, RC is kept clean and simple do need the southern expansion however. I just updated my game. Got the "Kit" Turkish counters. a bunch of charts more scenarios. Only $45 plus shipping.The rule bookk did come with the cover torn away from the staples. The only think that wasn't in a plastic bag. You'd think for 45 bucks they'd be able to send the kit new and undamaged but know. I rather expected it. (something wrong anyway) and I was right.

Excellent game.  A perfect evolution from The Russian Campaign.  Russia Besieged captures all the excitement of the east front in a reasonably simple format.  Use the most current living rules!  

The game has just the right amount of chrome.  The combat system is a step reduction based system that wears down both armies as the game progresses.  German typically loses steam by the end of 1942.  Very historical feel to the game and a major improvement on TRC.  Components are superb.  GEt the 9/16" counters.  Substantially nicer than the smaller 1/2" ones.  I also picked up Panzerschreck #14 for an interesting article and some bonus counters.

Russia Besieged is a game which simulates the most terrible conflict in the Human history between 1941 and 1945 : Hitler's Germany against Stalin's Russia.The map is exceptionnal, especially the graphics are beautiful. You have notably all the Caucasus and all the Black sea!The system game is near the TRC system game. However, it is much better because TRC is really too simplistic. For example, there are 3 very good innovations: Attack Blitzkrieg, step reduction for all the units and oil production which impacts the creation of Russian armor units.However, I have 3 reserves :- It remains some erratas or small imperfections in the living rules- the weather may impact too much the result of the game- When you have played many campaign games, the Russian have the edge. I think that L2DG must find rules which delayed the Russian advance from 1943.If not, The Russian reach Berlin too early (2 or 3 turns).Finally, I think RB remains for the moment the best strategic eastern front game because other games have too many erratas and are too simplistic or are in the contrary monster games.

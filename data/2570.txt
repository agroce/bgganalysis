Rating after 1 play.
I pretty much wanted to play again straight away.  Its a game with some great little mechanics.  Its also got a wonderful pain/pleasure principle as you see the ship you really need and then see another player take it or wipe them all away.  Arrrggghh!

Finally played again with 3. Felt a little long.
Also seems less fun. It is a relentlessly negative game.
But I still enjoyed it.

130929  I like the game enough that I considered purchasing it, but I have not -- so I don't love it.  Its an interesting game of card/resource management, plays well with six (which was a nice little niche in my previous game group).

111023 something clicked on my last play.  Not sure what...it could well go up. 

100600 I dislike games where things you do early have dire consequences in a very linear fashion.  This game is like that....My g/f loves the game, so I'll play it, but it is really, really low on my list of games to play...

I've so far only played this a few times, but I've really enjoyed it and found that the game had some great mechanics.  Seeing that I like ships, I was more interested in this than I would have been in Show Manager, and I think that the cards are really attractive and well made, as are all of the other parts.  

I like the fact that there are 5 columns to play cards in and that only 4 will be used per game - and that the ones that have highest victory points at the top, have the lowest at the bottom and Vice Versa.  That's really well thought out.  Obviously, you have to try and pick up low cards as often as possible to conserve money.  I guess it would be very hard to get all 8 cruises as bonus scorers in a two player game.  It's usually worth picking up a card that you don't need immediately if it looks like it gives you lots of options or hampers another player.  Nice game.  Hope to play it more soon.

Excellent, some major nail-biting decisions to be made, and the "prize board" adds a great twist into this set collection game.
Plays very well with two since it moves quickly and the chaos of gambling on your scores is more controllable.

Not a great game but a good, solid one.  My only complaint is that the theme is quite weak and the replay value lacks a little.  The main thing that makes this game good is the gut wrenching decisions on every turn.  Plus you have limited financial resources.  Yes you can borrow money, but it could very well cost you victory points in the end.  I can honestly say the decisions in this game are at least as tough as any I've seen in any other game.  The board, bits, and cards are all good to.

Great 6 player game.

RATING: 6
At heart a set collection game.  Players compete to put on the best tour by having the highest sum of collected cards (A, B, C, etc.) for that tour.  The hand limit is a nice way to provide an explicit amount of leeway.  Money becomes very tight.  Rotating the available cards down in price helps with the money and provides more interesting choices in view of players who play after you.  And you've gotta love the sweeping.  "Sweep!  Sweep!  Sweep!"

The bad?  More abstract than theme-related.  I wasn't very surprised to learn that this is re-themed from another game.  Luck plays a fair role and there's not a whole lot you can do to mitigate the luck (other than sweep and hope something better turns up).  In a 6-player game, card availability becomes non-existent for your third and fourth tours.  Better to go for an early, strong longer tour than wait to do it at the end when card selection is crap.

A fun enough game and one that I would play again, but there are others that I enjoy more.

A simple game of drafting cards for some very specific set collection. The choices available cause angst, but not too much. Feels really good when you can rearrange what you thought you were doing with your hand to do something else. Simple rules are easy to teach and understand. All in all, quite a good game. One play three-player, one five-player, equally fun both times.

Gift from Secret Santa 2008. Thanks!

Okay game, but very heavy on luck.  The retheming is not as appealing as the original show manager version, although game play is basically  identical.  Best played as a light filler and quickly.  Avoid playing with people who believe that flipping cards has a strategy.  [GTI: AGCL]

RATING: 6
Relatively quick playing set collection where you are trying to complete routes for the most information.  Money gets real tight at the end of the game.  

Plays well with 6, but don't start looking at the cards until 1 or 2 people before you, or you'll just get frustrated.

I hear it is a good 6 player game.  Seems like Showmanager version is the one to get.

With RFTG and Dominion possibly offering 6 player expansions later on, I don't think I'll need this game anymore to fulfill the 6p game niche.  Additionally, this game is so rare that it will cost a lot to get.

Very poor production for a game.  You have to collect cards to produce a "route", and the good thing is that you have a limit of cards, forcing you to make the route even if it is not good enough.

At least a solid '7'.  I don't see the peak rating ever rising to higher than an '8', but still a nice game to play every once in a while. 

*Update* Played another game and got completely stomped... which strangely raises my rating to an '8'.  I'm actually starting to appreciate the strategy that's present here, not heaps and heaps of strategy, but enough to make me want to play more in the future.

*Update* After my fourth play, I think my favorite part is the tension in trying to get the best cruises everytime and knowing when to cut your losses (and save your money for later cruises).

Atlantic Star is a good 'manager' game where you manage cruises.  My wife likes this game more than I do.  Good game for 2, problem is that all instructions and cards are in German.

RATING: 5
A game with much lucky and light tactics, you can't plan much, and if you are lucky to keep the right card, you have a big advantage. Tactics because after some game, you know a little what are best to do and a better vision of the card in general, good the choice when you score a cruise, how to place.
For me a little boring game.

I like having the additional cards in the deck over the original Queen edition of [i][thing=73]Showmanager[/thing][/i], especially when playing with three or six players when [i]Showmanager[/i] runs out of cards near the end of the game that you could use for a show and you're forced to include an actor that doesn't fit the part because none are left in the deck.

I haven't seen the newest version of [i]Showmanager[/i], but I still consider picking it up since it added the extra cards.

Straight up card drafting & set collection.  This game is very simple, yet very addictive.  I wish Queen Games hadn't pasted the cruise ship theme on this game... the theatre theme was much better (see Showmanager by Queen Games).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Amazingly well presented, the picture on each ship card is unique within the game. A finance aspect counteracts a random order of appearance of the ships. This is enough to liven up this set collection game and puts it above average for me.

I picked this up at the used game sale at ManorCon 2008, to find that the contents of the box were all still in the shrinkwrap. Bargain!

RATING: 7
Really enjoyable, and the cruise charter theme, for me, tops that of Showmanager.  Ticket to Ride Märklin probably still sits above this one for my card-based-complete-routes slot, but Atlantic Star's final points tally--based solely from the jockeying for best completed route position--lends a great twist.

I don't know what it is about this game that I enjoy so much, but we always have a lot of fun playing it.  There are always challenging decisions to make, but it's not too heavy to be the last game of a 12-hour game day.  Update:  Lowering this rating to a 7.5.  It hasn't aged particularly well for me -- too much chaos with more than 3 players.  With 2 or 3 players it's an 8, with 4-6 it's a 7.

A nice game on the lighter side of things. You must gather series of lettered cards to form a complete trip for your boats. The trip cards are suited in a color and playing cards in the correct color for the corresponding trip (there are 4 trips to make) will give a bonus. Players must purchase the cards they will use (money is very tight) and can be forced to "sell off" a trip they have completed to get more money if they mis-play (money at the cost of victory points).

I really like the choices in this game.  Artwork is good and I also like the theme.   It's also pretty accessible to newer players, making it a reasonably good family game.

11/3/06 - first game was 3-ers. I can see that this game would get more challenging with more people since the ships you need will most likely not be available when it is your turn to select from the ships pool. Second game was 5er and it was just as I suspected - in one round three different people cleared the board, sending three different valuable ships I could have used down the drain. Do not get too excited about what is available when it is not your turn. I will never turn down a game of this. Good fun and fairly quick game.

RATING: 8
Excellent little set-making game. Build a hand full of golden-era cruise ships in order to offer the most luxurious cruise in one of three territories. A nice combination of clever ship use and funding mechanics which reward intelligent play with a healthy dose of chance in the ship market that encourages flexible tactics. Played it once, really liked it. Had to wait a long time to get my own copy but it replays well and hasn't lost any of its charm.

Works great with 3, 4, and 6 (probably five as well, but I've yet to play with that number!)  Marvelous little game!  Getting the right boats at the right time can give you such OHMIGOD moments, while the other times when you're tempted to flush your whole game just to get an extra two points on your cruise the hurt is so good.  Not sure how this would play with two, but this is truly a well designed and fun game.

Didn't do much for me on the first playing, but grew on me with repeated play. Not much on player interaction, but lots of interesting juggling to get your cruises out. Sort of in the same mould as Alan Moon games such as Union Pacific or Reibach (or Dirk Henn's Stimmt So!), and while certainly not in the same league as Union Pacific, it still has a lot more interesting choices than the other games. Crucially, also works quite well with 6, which is a relative rarity.

Warning: rated after only one play.  Uninteresting game play which has you waiting and praying for the right cards to come up.  Will play again, but feel like the game has more to do with the order of the cards rather than any meaningful decision making.  Would like to own again purely for it's capability to play six and possibly as a gateway game.

RATING: 7
Decent set collecting game.  I like the press-your-luck aspect of both flushing the available cards and also when to play your set vs. when to wait another round hoping you can get something better.  The loan system is also really cool, as you have to decide how many points your willing to risk in order to get more cash.  Overall, a cool game, but I prefer the theme of Showmanager.  The cruise line theme just seems odd and misplaced.

This game reminds me so much of Alhambra that I am going to give it the same rating.  It's basically the same idea and has the same problems.  You want to do something and guide your play a certain direction, but the game won't let you do it.  You think, "Ok, I will go after the Pacific route, since I have a good start." and then it gets to your turn and realize that the Pacific sucks, and the person to your right takes all the cards you want because he is thinking the same thing, and you can't switch now because of the hand limit.  It's exhausting and frustrating, and that frustration level has no effect on who wins the game.  Everybody is frustrated, even the person who is winning.  It's as quick as Alhambra, and it works as a gateway game, but gamers looking for heavier fare will not be impressed.

A decent, but ultimately sub-average take on the set collection genre. 

Collecting cards to make melds would likely be rather dry, even with the money dynamic, but the limitation to one's hand size after each cruise makes the game quite tight, which in this case is to the game's detriment because you are often put into a position of having nothing good to do by luck of the draw or by an opponent guessing right and drafting the card you needed.

The jockeying for cards, and attempts to read what the other players are looking for seems to be the main draw in this game, but there is very little control over what is on the board, even with the deck clearing option, and with more than 2 at the table the card selection is usually completely changed by the time your turn comes around again. People who are repeatedly stymied by the available cards will have to spend a lot of money to repeatedly clear the deck, which will eventually impact their scores.

My biggest complaint though is that the game also seems to play a little long for what it is. Your turn to turn decisions are not all that complex, and the game is on the border of being completely out of control because of the tiny and constantly rotating draft pool. For meld making, I would much rather pull out a deck of standard cards and play something like Canasta.

Math Trade July 2007

First play January 20, 2008 - Didn't get to play a full game because oldest son held onto too many cards in his hand and was upset and quit.

Played one 2 player game with wife and think this is a lot of fun for couples.  There is quite a bit of luck in this game, but it has some interesting decisions.  

Played with four adults and enjoyed it much more.  Definitely some fun decisions to be made in this one.  We had a lot of people wiping the board trying to get their best position.

After playing this game a handful of times now, it is apparent that there is a lot of luck involved.  Some of it is controllable, but not all of it.  Still, it is a very engaging game and plays rather quickly.  Its a definite keeper in my collection and most of my game group enjoy/ask for it.

A nice game that works just as well with two as it does with more players. The shifting assessment of your hand makes it quite interesting.

Sure it's the same game play as ShowManager and Premiere, but damn the whole cruise line theme is bland, unappealing, boring, blech, meh, eguh.  That and the "circular" draft board pisses me off.  What were they thinking there?!?

RATING: 4
Components: Attractive components. The cards are very functional, and I enjoy the unique ship for each; overall a less busy, but less exciting re-theming. However, removing the theme is everything here; the theme doesn't really make sense, and isn't nearly as fun. Without the idea of putting actors in plays, the game boils down to just a strange abstract set collection game.

Experience: Game play runs a bit long, without the quality of the decisions changing significantly. The real tough decision is which routes to sandbag on, and borrow against, in order to afford good cards for more important routes. The good cards are mostly used up by the middle of the game, though with many players. With fewer players, it just slogs along; even having multiple chances at each route doesn't keep it fresh. I'd much rather play Show Manager.

RATING: 6
More than the publisher and box size will remind you of Alhambra, although the mechanisms of the two games are dissimilar. Both games are light and give you basically two choices on your turn. With five or six players, neither game permits much planning: you just see what's available when your turn comes around and make the best of it. Actually, the possibility of a card flush in Atlantic Star limits your ability to plan in two- and three-player games, as well.

I enjoy this a lot.  Everyone is engaged in which ship is turned over and who takes what.  Especially interesting how players set tempo themselves: set a high bar and everyone else scrambles, set a low bar and everyone slacks.  "Clear da boad!"  UPGRADE.  UPDATE: Still love!

Tense game of limited funds and the desperate need to buy suitable ships quickly.   I love that you can sacrifice points for money.

This quickly became one of my favorites.

It's sort of like a more strategic Ticket to Ride without the map but with an economic system tacked on. Yeah, the theme isn't as fun as Show Manager but, it's not a big deal.

Totally worth owning because it's hard to find a light middleweight game that plays fast, has a satisfying amount of strategy and plays well with 2 to 6 players.

It's shocking to me that this was never printed in english and is now out of print in any language.

Atlantic Star provides you with a number of decisions to manage, with the need to manage your money and determine when, exactly, it is worth starting a voyage, and when it is still worth trying to push your luck and hope to get that one, last card you need provides for some interesting choices in the game's time frame.  Still, I did not love it, and found myself a little bored while playing it.

I liked the planning aspect. It had just enough flexibility to be a little frustrating - but you never feel completely screwed out of the game, even if you mess up. A huge surprise coming from the guy who made Alhambra. He got his drafting mechanic down pat in this one.

Show manager- Atlantic Star-Show manager. Azaz első jelent meg előbb, majd a hajós téma, idén újra régi néven.
A keretet nem ismerem, csak a hajóst: szeretem. Gyors. 6 személyes, és úgy is élvezhető.
És nem lassul be tőle. 
Igazából kártyák gyűjtögetése, hogy a 4 útvonal vmelyikét ki tudjuk rakni, persze a lehető legtöbb pontot elérve, és az útvonal első kirakója által megadott minőségi oszlopba tegyük, ahol persze a többiek a pontjaik alapján elénk vagy mögénk kerülnek. Az adott minőségű útvonalak /egy útvonal egy minőség típusban/ oszlopában elért helyezés alapján kap az ember pontot, ami végül is a játék célja.
Kevés pénz: de hitelt lehet felvenni az elkészült hajókörút-útvonalra, (egy útvonalra csak 1 hitelt) aminek persze így csökken értéke, és az oszlopán belül hátrább sorolódhat.
A kártyák gyűjtésének limitje ötletes:Minden útvonal különböző hosszúságú. A limit meghatározása: annyi kártya lehet maximum a játékos kezében, h ha letesz/elkészül egy útvonal, akkor utána max 2 lap maradhat a kezében.
Ez erős korlátnak tűnhet, de bár az, azért megoldva, h mindig elkészülhessen az útvonal: ha nem sikerült megfelelő kártyákat beszerezni, akkor postahajóval (jolly), vagy bármilyen lappal (kitöltő) le lehet rakni, csak úgy az értéke kevesebbet, vagy jóval kevesebbet ér, na és persze a tökéletes út bónusz sem jár.
9 éves e változata, a dizájn is annak megfelelő, ugyanakkor szépek a kártyák, jó ötlet a zsírkrétás megoldás, szimpatikus, játék.

Set collection game. Theme doesn't do much for me. Somewhat similar to Alhambra. I prefer Alhambra over Atlantic Star. Randomness, luck  plays a lot in this game, a little dry. Not much control, rather simple. Can be a bit too long. A little repetitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun stuff, even though it's "broken" too often by the newbie who forgets that you can only have 2 cards left in your hand after you do a cruise.  Yes, the luck of how the cards come out can be painful, but planning is involved in how one uses the luck (or lack thereof).

I had a great six player game of this  and we were laughing all the way through. The basic game consists of building up sets of cards to complete voyages (like rummy) and trying to score highly on a scoring table against the other players. You have four different voyages you have to complete.

UPDATE: After playing once, I bought a copy before it went OOP. It's been sitting (shrinkwrapped) on my shelf since then. I guess that means that while I thought it was decent, it's not one I really need. To the trade pile!

Fun game, nice theme. Set collection/reverse auction/"press your luck" hybrid.

Strong hand management card game with some painful decisions stemming from the rule that allows you to have only two cards left in your hand when playing a cruise.

RATING: 8
Simple game that moves at a cracking pace. Absolutely no downtime whatsoever. There's money management involved but deep down, this is a game of risk taking (in order to get the higher-scoring ships). Theme is a bit weaker compared to other euros but it is a lighter game.

* Played 5+ times. 

2004 - Different theme than Showmanager, a little for the worse(boats instead of actors), but improved visuals from Showmamanger, which is nice. Exact same game. After the first game, the "cruise" theme doesn't really detract from this game, because the game is really that good. And the art style is quite visually pleasing too. Recommended. My family liked it a lot, and I enjoy it 2-6 players which makes it a rare "free range" gem.

2013 AUG 31 - Revising ratings, this game just lacks the sparkle it once had, which is funny because nothing has really replaced it for me mechanically, but let's be honest here: The cruise ship theme is a poor one.

2014 July - Still good for what it is: easy to teach, easy to play, fairly tense hand management game that plays in 60 minutes.

This game falls into the same category as Ticket to Ride and Airlines Europe. It's mostly drawing cards and playing them at the right time to score points.

Atlantic Star is a decent light set collection game. There is a lot of luck due to the cards being flipped but being able to keep up to two cards and the tight amount of money offer some room for tactical decisions. Not a lot of thinking required (except maybe when taking loans although that's more gambling than thinking, really) so I don't understand the "my brain hurt" comments.

Impression after one play.  Significant about of luck in the availablity of cards, but I have a feeling that with experience much of it might be balanced out.  Learning curve is not very steep, but you're very likely to learn the hard way the first game especially on the first 2 or 3 draws.  Keep in mind that you have to keep EVERY card you draw!  A bit long with six players (almost 2 hours), but wil; definitely try again

Shogun is great. Alhambra is outstanding. Timbouctou is intriguing but also very good. So now there comes a time for Atlantic Star. And right from the start it was a big dissapointment for me. There is some strategy, there is a lot of tactics, there is interaction and there is tension. But all this simply doesn't combine in a good game. For me there was more of fighting with the game itself than with the other players.

And besides - the idea with special pencil and washable tokens (although carried out pretty well) is horrible because you have to be very careful not to damage these pieces.

Make your Cruises trying to get the best ships for that, but you have to spend money and it is really scarce within the game. Position yourself in the best category for each of the cruises as this will lead you to have more VP or allow you to get more money subtracting it from your Cruise, this is done really well and will bring many fights in the table

Same game as Showmanager but with a slightly different deck distribution.  More importantly, the publisher changed the theme from casting actors in order to stage musicals to acquiring ships in order to put on ocean cruises.  Bad, bad, bad choice.  Not only is the cruise ship theme flat and uninspiring, it also doesn't really make any sense.  Otherwise, see my comments for Showmanager (which I rate 7/10).

Six (and a half!) plays, ranging from three to six players. Excellent middleweight game. There's a surprisingly large number of things going on for a game that plays this simply and smoothly. Players spend money to collect sets; in the early game they can bet on how high their relative score will be in a given set; in the mid-game they can (usually must) take points off of one set to fund further play; finally, if they're really paying attention, they can shuck away the cards that they know their opponents are collecting. Good stuff. 

I like the game best with four, incidentally. Back in the day, people used to only bring it out when they needed a six-player game, just because it was one of the few games that played okay with six. The four-player game is more strategic and worthwhile, however.

I'm impressed by this game.  It's simple, but there's a surprising amount of depth to playing well.  As you acquire more cards, your options become increasingly limited.  The only way to get rid of your cards is by laying them down in a set, so you have to make efficient use of limited resources.

When I had read the rules, I remember thinking that there really was a lot less to the game then I had thought there would have been.

I was pleasantly surprised that this was one of those games that have few rules, but that still manages to have some tension and some decisions.

Overall it was fun.  I'm not sure about 6 players.  There seemed to be downtime, but we are a social group so it was mainly from losing focus.

A pleasantly light set collecting game with attractive artwork. Plenty of chaos and luck of the draw, though. You're heavily dependent on your right hand neighbour to leave you a reasonable choice, clearing the display and re-drawing is a complete gamble, you might have a 9-ship fall into your lap, you might get nothing. In all a fun little diversion, nothing to think too hard about.

Excellent set collection game, with the restriction that you can't have more than two unused cards in your hand when scoring a set.  It feels very much like you're competing against the game as well as the other players (as in Age of Steam), which is something I enjoy quite a bit.

A nice little game that plays as well with 6 as it does with 4.  There's only a slight increase in down time as the player numbers increase.

RATING: 7
Played twice (with 5 and 6 players): the rules promised an interesting game with some strategic depth, but the play revealed that card draw (and hence luck) is a major factor. In fact, the game seems to be too focussed on the cards, to the detriment of other factors. Still, I like the fact that you must be careful with money, or else potentially sacrifice victory points by taking out a loan. I suspect the game improves with fewer players.

As a great fan of games with the marine theme Atlantic Star was a must have for me. The game is well done and the rules simple. Additionally the play is quick and it scales nicely from 2 to 6 players. Solid position!

RATING: 6.9
Previously had played Showmanager a few years before so no problem with getting back into it.  We did play 6 players which made it tight on cards at the end (even with the extra cards this one has over Showmanager).  While it plays fast for a 6 player game, may still be better with less player (4 or 5).

RATING: 3
I just don't care for this game.  I feel like I'm completely at the mercy of the cards -- and sometimes the cards will punish me for having made a binary choice between two cruises.  This is a game that actively frustrates, not just a game which isn't fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'll definately give this another go, but was a little disappointed.  There seemed to be a high level of luck, little interaction, the theme seems badly pasted on and in places doesn't fit the mechanics in any meaningful way that I could see.  Also our game had a lot of paying 2,000 to burn the cards - which slowed the game and rather than a choice of last resort became an often used tactic to boost cruise values.  Having said all those negative things I still enjoyed the game.  Played again and opinion improved slightly.

I enjoy the game, but feel so much at the whim of the cards.  There is a tremendous need to get just the right cards at just the right time, with limited flexibility.  Of course, I never win.  Maybe the people who *do* win know what makes the game really tick.

Always a good addition to the collection for the times you need a game for six.

It's unbelievable how few rules could make a good Eurogame at the turn of the millenium. Today, Martin Wallace and all those complex new Eurogames have ruined our taste buds like gluten. Atlantic Star is an exercise in simplicity but far from being pointless. Need more money, take a credit. Buy a cruiseship or start the cruise, Done. The genius is in the score card and its interrelation with credits.
On a side note, this is the only game with graphics of Christoph Tisch which I like so far.

RATING: 6
This is a nice little set collection game. Scoring is cool in that the first to complete a given cruise gets to pick the scoring column for that cruise. The ability to take loans causes some occasional heartburn over where to take the loan, since it potentially impacts your final score on a cruise. Little bit of push your luck when shooting for that last ship you need in a voyage.  Luck is a definite factor in terms of what ships are available on your turn, and how much they cost, but there are opportunities for risk mitigation too. Nothing too deep here, but a handful of "little" mechanics that come together to make a solid, fun game.

The card drafting game TTR should've been. Its a very simple game with a cool scoreboard-style chart which players fill in as they complete routes.

The rules (particularly the hand limit) sound strange the first time but it's quite a fun set collection game and moves quickly. Folks seem to grasp how to play the game fairly easily. Hasn't seen much play recently, maybe because it's in the corner of my games bookshelf.

This game, and its brother, Show Manager, are the same exact game.  Not sure why we need both.  That being said, the mechanic here is just so-so.

The most interesting aspect is figuring out if and when you should take out a loan, and for how much.

I like this game a lot. I think the mechanisms are simple yet interesting and the game play has a nice mix of tactics and luck. There is a nice trade off between greed and prudence in this game... do I risk a big trip and go for a better card or play it safe and take a sure thing for a few points less. Sweeping away the cards when you know you can deny your opponent a juicy card is always a nice option as well... "What? You needed that card... gee I didn't know that"... hehe

Reprint of Showmanager with a different theme. One is building shipping lines with cards. On their turn, a player either 1) acquires a card, paying money for it depending on the location of the card on the board, 2) "sails" a shipping line, but afterwards can only have a maximum of 2 cards left in their hand, or 3) clear the board of cards, at a cost, to see new cards. Players also have the option to mortgage the value of their shipping lines for more money, at a cost of VPs.
To build the optimum shipping lines one must pay attention to what other people are collecting and what is potentially left. Easy, clean and games clock in under an hour. I really enjoy this game and sure, luck is a factor when which ships come up during your turn, or who "clears the board", but tough decisions must be made on hand management as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Really liked the rotation of the ships and buying the set needed to win. The scoring was neat though I disliked the crayon needed. I like the design, how players finish within a turn of each other - that was neat.

Plays: 1

Paper money, writing necessary with crayon, nonintuitive for beginners to play, not simple for beginners when it should be probably, better auction games out there now and last my opinion is probably a bit skewed since i almost won.

There is very limited chance to interact with other players but every time a good board for others is "flushed" the annoying faces of opponents remind you it's not just solitaire gameplay. Theme is a paste-on and doesn't add too much to the game. The gameplay seems to work most differently with 4 players (haven't tried two player/three player) as the deck isn't depleted as much as with 3/5/6 players during second run through it.

A refreshing set collection game. Fast-flowing even with six players, takes about one hour only.

If you ever need a game for exactly six players, this is the best. Four players is the absolute minimum.

Just a great game. A classic. It doesn't try to do too much. It doesn't outstay its welcome. I can't say that I find myself pulling it off the shelf frequently, which is why it isn't rated higher. But, whenever it does find its way to the table, it is always a hit, and I find myself wondering why we don't play it more often.

Same as Show Manager barring a slightly different card distribution and the end-game cards left. I prefer the Show Manager theme which allows for more hamming it up, but otherwise it's the same game and same comments. This game is about the draft, the whole draft and nothing but the draft. Watch carefully what the players to your right are picking up ... and then hope you get lucky being presented with good cards for different shows than them. It's a nice game that works for 6 players as long as you're ok with the luck.

RATING: 7
Delightful. Tight money-management "route-building"/set-collection points game. Buy cards to build "routes" to get onto the board grid for end game points only. Simple to teach and play, but there are a few rules easy to get wrong. Games can take less than an hour. Good 2-player game. As I've not played Show Manager, I cannot say which version I like better.

The rules needs rework for better understanding.

3-4-5-6 hosszúságú utakat kell megterveznünk a feljövő kártyákból amikért 1-3000 dollárt fizethetünk (a legutolsó lap ingyenes). Fontos szabály, hogy max. 2 lappal lehet több a kézben, mint amekkora utat lerakunk.
Ha kész egy útvonal, akkor az adott táraságjelőlőnket berakjuk a pontozótáblára, ha pl. a 4-est más is megépíti, akkor alá vagy fölé helyezi a pontszámtól függően.
Ha elfogy a pénzünk, akkor van lehetőség hitelt felvenni.(max 10 pont / 10.000 $ értékben) Méghozzá úgy, hogy áthúzzuk a pontot és az alsó sorba beírjuk a hitel utáni összeget és ezzel újra rangsoroljuk.
Amint mindenki leteszi az utolsó útvonalát, akkor összeszámoljuk a társaságokat.

Like the card drafting mechanism where you have a limited ability to grab just the right card. How some cards can do double duty but the highest value ones can't
Also like the first person to complete an area sets the value for it. You can use the values in the rules for fewer players to get a feel for what you should be earning from a route.
Feel it is better with fewer players 3 seems to be a sweet spot. - can do some planning - with a lot of players the cards cycle too quickly

Hand management is crucial in this game.  If you pick up a card you can't use in that first cruise, it haunts you the rest of the game.

Not at all what I thought it would be.  The drafting of cards for your hand drives this game.  Tension between flexibility and strength of suit.

Initially passed this game off as a simple rummy clone, which it is; Collect your sets try while maximizing points. However, after several plays and comparing it to Alhambra which utilizes a similar mechanism for ship purchases (and which I find to busy and random..Alhambra I mean,) its simplistic approach and fast gameplay adds up to more than the sum of its parts and I find it a compelling and enjoyable game.

Wow, this is a game that really surprised me.  The first time I played it, we ended up playing three in a row.  Then I couldn't wait to play it again.  Now, I finally have my own copy.  It seems to play well with any number from 2 to 6.  Of course, I'm a sucker for cards games, which this really is, as well as set collection (yes!) and route-building (sort of / kind of).  Then throw in a very limited supply of money to force some decision making and hand balancing.  Definitely a winner.

[2 plays] I'm not a big fan of Mr. Henn's games. Alhambra is like pulling teeth for me, and this game has a somewhat similar feel of play; drafting of cards and crappy luck of seeing what you want when you can't get it. However, it is attractive, quick playing, has a few fun "screw you" moments, and offers some tense choices at times.

Update 2013: much more favorable opinion of this on the 2nd play -- and after 7 years. I can see some clever mechanics here, and it was fun despite its being largely an abstract game. Raising my rating to 7. 

Most recent play Aug '13.

A high-quality remake of Premiere and Show Manager: with a shipping theme. The weak theme aside, this is a fast playing game about hand and money management.

Choice are deceptively simple: do you play it safe and draft cards to complete short routes or try to go for broke and gun for the longer, potentially high scoring routes?

Scales well from 2 to 6 and played quickly too. Should be over in an hour. Only grip is the whole crayon business: it gets messy trying to clean the tile after a game. Dry erase was worse.

Annoying: the box has 5 different languages on the back, including english but there are NO english rules! doh!

This game isn't overly complex, but that's okay.  The set collection of trying to maximize the points for the cruise and then use the cruise value to basically speculate for points is interesting.  I also like that you can mortgage the cruise value for more money that's needed to continue in the game.  The game plays at a good pace regardless of the number of players.  I personally like the cruise theme better than the Show Manager theme.  I would definitely play this game again.

Fantastic set collecting/drafting game, with a great scoring system.  Tons of small tactical decisions, that add up to a much larger strategy.  Plays quickly and really whips along at a steady pace.  The tight money requires that you should borrow from at least one cruise, so the real game comes in on the second board risking the points that you have already earned in order to get some quick cash against what you suspect the other players will be working toward. It's a tough game to get straight from the rules, but easy to teach if you already know it.

Better than Showmanager, despite the weaker theme as there are some minor corrections to improve playability and readability.  Plus, the art in this is just so much more attractive.  I was told to pretend that you are smuggling guns and that really helps.

There is a common board to pick from, and the things you need may or may not be there by the time things come back around to you.

Atlantic Star is really the same game as Showmanager, so I'll repeat my comments here.  I will say that I like the Broadway theme of Showmanager slightly more than the ship theme.

The money-management aspect is intriguing, and there are a lot of laughs as the calls of "Torpedo them!" come fast and furious towards the end.

Light and relatively quick game that is great with 2, 3 or 6.  Playing with 2 or 3 gives you a little more control (though luck of the draw still plays a part), and the chaos of 6 is still fun.

Money is always tight and there are plenty of opportunities to push your luck (and your pocketbook) by tossing out the available cards and getting a slate of new ones.  Some say that the theme of Showmanager is more appealing, but I like the artwork of Atlantic Star and the theme works well enough.

Great middle-weight hand management game. Turns come around quickly, tough decisions throughout, and it can be taught very quickly.

Atlantic Star is the kind of game that I can definitely see someone just getting into the hobby latching onto as one of their favorites in a nostalgic sort of way.  It's not quite a gateway/introductory game, but a second-level, small-step-up sort of game with a bit of complexity, but still fairly straightforward.  What it really does nicely is showcase the greatness of eurogames by having simple rules and a good deal of luck, but pairing those with a quick playing time and interesting decision-making.  If I'd played it toward the beginning of entering the board game hobby, then I think I'd have liked it even more because it would've really opened my eyes.  As it is, I've seen most of what Atlantic Star has to offer before in other games, but I still appreciated it for its elegance.  It doesn't have the same sort of depth and complexity that I'm generally looking for in games nowadays, and is sort of caught in that middle-ground for me between fluffy fillers and long meaty games, but I can nonetheless see pulling it out from time to time, especially with 6 players.

Excellent set collection game. Scales incredibly well. The game shines with 3-4 players but is an entirely different game with 3 as you get to play each route twice. Completely changes the strategy.

This is a re-implementation of Show Manager.  It's basically the same game so the game is fun but the theme is extremely clumsy.  I don't know if it is as awkward if you haven't played Show Manager but if you have this game will come up lacking.

As a cruise ship fan, and a card game fan, this fun game is a perfect choice. Fantastic old style ships on the cards.

Fairly simple card set collecting game, but with some good "gotchas" to make it all very interesting. The first one is that you have a limited hand size *after* you claim a specific route. The end result is that once you start drawing cards for a particular route, you have to stick to that route, as you can only be holding two spare cards. So, even though there may not be a good card available, you can't just grab a card that doesn't fit with the intent to get rid of it later, or ignore it, since there are no discards. Also troublesome is the limited funds, and you have to sacrifice points gained in order to take a loan for more money, so that you can continue to buy cards.

Nice game, but not stunning. You most likely play it with more than four players, two or three is possible, but the key essence of the game makes it more suitable for 4 of more. I'm not that impressed, I play it sometimes and see a nice game, but a 7 rating will never happen in my list.

The only reason I've ditched [b][i]Atlantic Star [/i][/b]is that I have a copy of [i]Show Manager[/i] and prefer that version of the game over this one due to [i]SM[/i]'s theme and tighter card distribution. [i]Atlantic Star[/i] has a few extra 3/3/3 cards that make it easier for players to fulfill routes, while simultaneously making for somewhat fewer "Ohmigod, I can't believe you got that lucky when you cleared the board!" moments. That said, the game design is solid and better to have this design than nothing at all.

The other version of Showmanager - it's still a good game,  but the theme hangs pretty weakly.  Actors parts and plays are much more thematic than legs A/B/C of a route...I like being able to choose the order of where to place cards after a refresh,  but it feels pretty random/card-counting sensitive.

Great with non-gamers so its definately a plus!

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). A typical ok game - it works without any major flaws, but it is not very exciting either. Some ideas are quite good, there are choices to be made, and the game is enjoyable overall, but rather blandly so.

Atlantic Star is not exactly the same as Showmanager.  There are more cards in the Atlantic Star deck, making this the better choice for 6 players.  Allowing 2 additional cards instead of 1 in your hand after the final cruise is the superior rule.  With 6 in Showmanager, if everyone had 2 remaining cards you'd use the entire deck so you can't simply modify Showmanager rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An almost exact replication of Showmanager with the exception of 2 rule differences:

1. When flushing the board, you refill starting with the highest ($3000) instead of the lowest ($0) spot.
2. You can have two leftover cards in your hand for the last route played rather than one.

While the first does not matter too much, the second change makes the game slightly easier and more forgiving since you get to keep an extra card.

Although I'm not a big stickler on themes, as most people have commented, putting on productions of plays is just a lot more interesting than plotting routes for cruise ships.  The cards and the scoreboard are all very mundane and drab in comparison to Showmanager.  So if I'm going to play, I'd rather stick with the original.

Never played Showmanager, but I think I would prefer that one to Atlantic Star since the theme seems to fit better with the mechanic (having up to 6 different boats to organize a single cruise is a bit non-realistic to me). I don't find the theme appealing and I don't feel like I'm organizing cruises for tourists. Not a bad game, though.

Great game for new gamers!  Simple rules, simple play.  Note: there is a high "luck factor."  Interestingly enough, this does not detract from the enjoyment of the game.  If anything, the element of chaos adds to the energy of the play!

Rating is a preliminary one pending a chance to play it [having read the rules online].  Map ended up looking very nice although I wish the blue didn't have that weird texture.  Other components up to the usual GMT quality.  Rules are well written, made sense on the first read through.  I look forward to trying a game at which point I will update the review.

This wargame really captures the history of the period. A lot of cat and mouse action with the search attempts and Fog of War blocks.Battles are fairly easy to understand with a run through but you are faced with many options and dilemmas. Many small details to remember but they all add to the history...and enjoyment..of the game. 9/11/12 Updated my rating from 8 to 9. No loss in interest after almost a year of on/off play of same game. CXontinues to be very thematic; a simulation but not so much so that play is not enjoyable.

Finally! A game that shows just _why_ a blockade of the French and Spanish during the Napoleonic Wars was such a herculean, important, and difficult task. Most books and games simply point to the size and professional zeal of the Royal Navy during the period as the obvious reasons for their superiority and why France and Spain would be fools to go up against them. This game shows that the tremendous resources and organization necessary to maintain the navy were needed as much to withstand the weather as much as to fight the enemy.

But this game goes many steps further and reveals what the Spanish and French were capable of (or what the Royal Navy at least feared they were capable of) if they ever managed to break Britain's hold. As importantly, it shows how weather alone would simply wear down a blockading force to the point of weakness and allow the Allies the opportunity to sortie. It is no wonder that the British invested so much in material and manpower just to keep the blockade in effect: it was cheaper than if the Allied navies were allowed to sail free. Likewise, why the Allies so often stayed in port: weather is the cheapest and most effective ally in battling the blockaders.

As well as the game succeeds in those particulars, the map and play aids I thought were a let-down. 90% of the map is oriented to the person sitting at the bottom. The map itself is quite dark and the hexes for port entry are a bit hard to discern. The Port displays on the map are also unnecessarily elaborate and overly large. The game also requires a large foot print once the map is down and the 17x11 player-aids are spread out. The chit pool I would rather have seen as a deck that is shuffled and cards flipped each turn. IOW, the components are fine, but their design is a bit of a barrier to play.

Played it completion twice.  I like the game a ton, but really needs to be played by folks that are a fan of sailing games.  It is the only operational level sailing game I've ever played.  Recommended for period and subject fans, but not really suited for the casual gamer.  It's lengthy, but quite engaging

As has been commented by others, the campaign game is long, no way you can finish it in 6 hours. I would plan on 10-12 for your first game. I think if the game *were* completable in 6 hours, it would actually be good. But that would mean that a lot of stuff would have been taken out and streamlined. I don't see how the game as it is can possibly be completed in less than 8 or so. By way of a sobering comparison, that's about the same length as a '42-'45 game of Europe Engulfed.
---
We tried to play the campaign game; it got off to a great start, as the French tried to raid Ireland in winter and storms relentlessly hammered both fleets between battles. But the game then seriously tanked. Turn after turn of tedious chit pulling with absolutely nothing happening, endless fiddling of a couple ships being damaged by storms on blockade and returning to port and being replaced. Both sides were simply recovering from the brutal winter fighting, but we still had to pick dozens of chits, make dozens of weather die rolls, which bogged the game down to a crawl; we were playing for what seemed like hours with literally nothing happening, except meaningless shuttling of damaged ships around. Another big problem is the Caribbean area of operations. This seems like it is going to be, for the most part, populated by a fairly small number of ships who will have a go at each other from time to time. Which would be fine, but the combat system is really optimized for large fleet actions, which means small skirmishes are painfully tedious to resolve. This is a game which is loaded with good historical flavor. I actually quite like the combat system, which has a great feel and tends to produce the historical indecisive results while still allowing good admirals the chance of decisive victories. When a French fleet attempts a breakout, there is some excitement to be had. But that is not most of the game. Most of the game is mired in tedium and is, as a whole, basically an unplayable mess that manages to produce an hour or so of interest in its 8-hour-plus playtime. Far too much time is wasted in meaningless chit draws, trivial weather rolls, the cycle of damage and repair for a few ships, and other relatively mindless trivia. This needed to be a game about squadrons or fleets, not individual ships, and needed its playing time compressed by about 75%.

More of the by-now traditional overwrought, under-developed junk from GMT. Great idea for a game, but incredibly tedious and uninteresting to play for much of its insanely bloated play time. One to avoid.

I need to play this more! Not many operational naval games in this setting. A very fascinating peek into the difficulties that faced France and England during this period, in terms of the strategic naval war. 

Love the game, dripping with theme. A lot of rules to learn, however, and a long play time, make it hard for me to get to the table.

[05/07/08]Having read the example of play, 1805 clearly moves to "must have" status for me. I have never played a naval wargame and naval warfare never was a particular interest of mine. But that might well change with 1805.Clever mechanics. 1805 is bound to become the flagship followed by many other designs following in line.

Only played the Trafalgar Scenario so far.  It was a very interesting little game.  Can't wait to try the Campaign Game this Friday.

UPDATE 12/06/2009: I am about half way through my first full game (a friend and I are playing the campaign through various sessions).  So far, the game will be chalked up as a learning game; the British player failed to start off his expeditions early, and the French failed to be as aggressive as they probably should have been the first few turns of the game.  All in all, my original assessment holds true, and I like this game for what it is: a very well-thought-out treatment of operational naval warfare in the Age of Sail.

Some caveats:  (1) The rulebook does have some problems--the designer has even posted answers to questions stating "this is the rule, but it didn't make it into the rulebook" which I find very frustrating.  (2) The game's time limitations have not held out very well--six hours for the campaign game seems very, very generous.  My opponent and I have had two sessions and are barely half-way through the year.  All-told, maybe 7-8 hours of actual play time over a total of 10-12 hours of meeting (we stop for lunch, and to talk, and to do rule look-ups, etc).  Assuming that we are playing at half speed, that's still a 7-8 hour time frame for the campaign, and that is being generous.  (3) The British apparently will never lose a toe-to-toe fight.  Run away as the Allies unless you've got close to a two-to-one numerical (firepower) advantage.

I'll revise my ratings after the conclusion of the game.

UPDATE 01/03/2010:  Finished the game and posted various rules questions here at BGG as the game was being played.  Also started a strategy thread.  I liked the game quite a bit and would like to play it again, but there are definitely some strategy tips that the English player needs prior to wasting his time playing the first game (the English are the more challenging side to play for inexperienced players).  Looking forward to another play, but my local opponent, alas, was not as taken with the system as I was (he played the English).  Cheers.

UPDATE 05/11/2014: Played the "A Change of Plans" scenario with Alan Richbourg (chargetheguns) via PBEM.  A fun, quick game that I really enjoyed.  I won the game, but it was primarily due to really horrible rolling on the Allied side.  The French were walloped twice in two battles at the end, but it was not enough to tilt the points scoring in the Allied favor.

Solid game, I love the historical situation and the designers attempt to recreate it.  I cannot give it a higher rating based on mechanics and play.  Many turns can pass before heated activity occurs. This is simply not everyone's 'cup of tea' so to speak.  For those 'into' the Age of Sail then maybe a "9" rating is an automatic!

RATING: 8
This is interesting. It's really a patience game for the allies. You have to wait for the British to be at their worst and run for it, hoping they won't catch you through use of misdirection. Maybe send out one ship just to get more fog of war blocks before sending out your real fleet. Keep the British guessing. I'm excited for more plays.

1805: Sea of Boredom. The game starts off way too slow. I found myself falling asleep by turn 7th or 8th turn of NO FREAKING ACTIVITY. You are way too at the mercy of those damn chits as the French player. Sure the English were getting there ships battered to bits during the winter, but it was not from anything I was doing. I could never get the chits to line up with the freaking wind to move out to sea. This may have been an atypical game, but after playing I am not sure I ever want to see it again.

Also, what gives with the over sized blocks? Obviously, the stickers were meant for small blocks. They look ridiculous on the large ones.

Intriguing game with lots of hide-and-seek, rather than outright fighting. I like a lot of things here, one of them being randomly drawn vp-yielding objectives kept hidden from the opponent so we do not know what the other player has to focus on. If you have patience and like a shadow-boxing naval war this is for you. One downside is the map.

This is a great game.  The first couple times we played we messed up a critical rule that wasn't in the rulebook but was answered by the designer.  There are a lot of rules to digest and I did get confused at times if something was supposed to apply and found myself constantly referring to the rulebook. Fog of War is great - lots of bluffing involved - and I really like the combat system.

Rating after 1 play. There doesn't appear to be anything "broken" about this game. You just have to accept the fact that the French are going to have to wait for the right moment to breakout. That could mean sitting around doing nothing for several turns, waiting for a confluence of storms that scatter the British and a fleet that's actually able to sortie.

While historical, it will probably be uninteresting to folks who aren't into the time period.

Gosh, a few part of this game are great, especially the asymmetrical sides, play balance, hidden info, and the wonderful wind mechanics. 

But overall the abstractions do not go far enough for my tastes, and it leans quite far into the realm of simulation instead of a game. Far far too much fiddling with chits and chart-consulting. Lots of hours consumed by flipping and re-arranging chits instead of back-and-forth decisions.

If your goal is to re-enact an alternate Napoleonic naval history, this is awesome. Perfect for generating WSIM scenarios! But a replayable game that can be finished in one sitting? Not so much.

Certainely a good simulation, but it doesn't make an intersting or fun game. You pull hundreds of chits and wait for something to happen.
The quality of the French navy seems underevaluated : French squadrons or fleet have very little chances to survive if they meet a British couterpart. Unless they largely outnumber them. Ok, the Royal Navy was really superior, but in the game, it is exegerated and it raelly restrains the French player from trying is luck in the open sea.

RATING: 4
I really want to love this game, but the massive game length makes it hard to get to the table and play a full game.  Also, the blocks are a bit too big, and the rest of the components are up to (or down to) GMT's usual standards.  

The actual gameplay seems pretty fun though, and I like how asymmetrical the game is. 

EDIT:  Tried another play of the game, still only made it about a 3rd of the way through after about 5 hours of play.  Just too long for my tastes.  Just a little bad luck can pretty much wipe out a player.  Perhaps it's realistic, but for a game this long, it's not terribly fun.  I'll give the Trafalger Scenario a try and see how that goes; otherwise I doubt I'll see this game come out very often, which is too bad when I'm so in love with this time period.

There are some games that are difficult for me to play because of their depiction of the oceans.  This is one of them. The colors are so off-putting that I am unable to enjoy the game, which looks great. I know I sound like a whiner on this, but I am not a whiner (usually). I had the same problem with Rails of Europe. Ah, well. Maybe another version will have a map that is easier on the eyes.

Several Reasons I give this a 10

1. The combination of intertwined mechanics are masterful. There is nothing in this game that does not need be there. A great use of blocks/initiative/random events all gives a great experience.

2. You can tell this was made by a seaman (has appreciation of sea and its limitations and favours) when I played it I could feel the sea spay on my face.

3. The Dedication of the Designer, his work on the Wiki is just great. Help you get into the game quickly.

4. Re-playability: The random placement of objectives (Napoleon  objectives), the extra incentives with Emperor’s Directives and the British Objectives makes the game ever changing.

5. This reason is a bit of a wish, but the combination of Flying Colors for the battles would be great, however the current battle system is clever and fits the theme.

RATING: 5
Played by email, and it was not a very exciting experience. The first six turns of the game I drew none of the counters that let the French actually sail, so I had literally nothing to do (besides rearranging the deckchairs in the Caribbean). Procedural, random, slow... I guess maybe it gets exciting when you have lots of fleets at sea,, but there's so much tedium to wade through for such a small payoff that I won't play it again.

PbeM suitability: not very high, due to the high number of null logs and the increased difficulty of remembering anything about the possible composition of fleets etc. over a longer span.

French on other side struggling with provision chits and bad wind directions when trying to sortie out.

Great game but very long. The tension when the enemy have successfully sortied is a nightmare and likewise the sense of dread when you are sortieing and trying to avoid being clobbered by British fleets.

I described it as a battle of heavy weight against welter weight. The welter weight can dance and jab but if the heavy weight lands a blow or two it will end the bout... Which is why the feeling of dread when you are found by an English fleet is a real feel it your heart in your toes moment.

Could do with a pass option to speed turns after heavy actions when often there will be no action nor any likelihood of action (save shuffling damaged blockaders and the like). Perhaps sonething like that in Rommel in the Desert- pass? Yes. Pass? Yes. proceed to admin phase. With each question pair getting more difficult as reinforcements and supplies flow in (will he this time? should I) And with weather done by chart than chit.

Starts off rather slow but gets interesting when the French fleets escape and start running around the oceans.  Face to face keeping up with the number or damaged ships, firepower counts, etc., is a headache.  Much better on Vassal. If the theme does not interest you greatly I would be surprised if this draws you in.  Random factors such as weather, victory point values, and successful search are huge elements in the game.

Much more involved game than we expected from the back of the box.  Kind of block game but not really.  It feels from our single, basic game play that a single loss can pretty much do you in over the longer game but this may be untrue.  New mechanisms make it difficult to get started.  I like the battles, however.

20 hours to play, and a lot of busy work.  I think this could be a good 6 hour game with substantial re-development work.

    Wonderful subject, Great game mechanics and components, super online support My only gripe would be that the rules seem a little unfinished and at times disjointed and confusing almost like the developers decided 3 months before the game was sent to print that it was "Good Enough" and never did a final polish and indexing. This is something that has been popping up in GMT’s games recently in a sort of hit and miss fashion. Case in point Elusive Victory’s rules are very well done.
    Still after a little confusion while reading through the rules we were able to figure out with the help of Phil’s online tutorial videos the right way to play and dove right it. The game plays very well both FtF and using Vassal, the very well designed module (by Rob Doane) was available before 1805 SoG reached anyone’s doorstep.          
            I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME

Very narrow approach on the french-english war at sea, focusing on one year, perhaps a striking example for the Napoleon-centrism of the wargame crowd (the year the master himself wanted to invade England).
I would have prefered a broader and strategic approach, starting with the 1st coalition against revolutionary France and maybe spanning up to 20 years.
Recommended reading for a short overview of the 1790's: - The Art of War of revolutionary France, 1789-1802- by Paddy Griffith, with its small chapter about the Navy, but during the whole book are references. Also very funny to read are the comments on Napoleon.

1805 is a great simulation and a good game. Give it a try if your interested in an operational age of sail game. I almost didn't because of the negative reviews on the game that are quite off-putting (long, tedious etc.) This is a long game (the campagn takes a day or two to play) but it's also historically accurate and very exciting, not tedious at all!

interested after having read a review http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/449095/first-impressions. However concerned by negative comments on "nothing happening" during many phases of the game, combined with a play time of about 9 hours. I personally feel excited about the idea and would like to play it, but I am pretty sure my current gaming partners will not enjoy such a game.

A very unique game for my collection.  I like the fact that this doesn't play quite like anything else I own.  Lots of tension.  Rules are a bit fiddly for my taste, but overall it is a ingenious new idea.  Unfortunately, the game is very difficult to understand strategically for someone with little experience with naval combat of the era.  I've played it four times and was destroyed every time, and during most of those games I didn't really understand why.  Could benefit from more strategy information in the rules for newbies.

An amazing naval warfare game.  The French/Spanish have to plan carefully to hit the British hard and avoid being chewed up piecemeal.  The British "simply" have to guess correctly and not overcommit to meaningless engagements.  Tension on both sides!  Mechanics flow into a beautifully presented gaming situation.

Love the period but only managed to play once. Has some very basic flaws on the combat table which allows a fleet of 30+ to be unable to sink or capture all of a fleet of 3. Something like that. Also, the game I played lacked action and became an exercise in ship maintenance and fleet logistics - not exactly what I had in mind when I bought it.

Great game.  This game is a lot of fun to play.  Each side has it challenges. You have to have a technique to play each side.  Easy to learn.  Playing 1805 is always different from the game before in large part due to the weather.

RATING: 8.5
A clever system of chit-picking simulates the uncertainties of wind and weather.

I love this game, but it's not for everybody. It can take several hours to play, and if the Franco-Spanish Allied player doesn't take some risks (i.e., come out of port and risk the big, bad British fleets) then not only will he lose, both players will have a dull time. But when the Allies [i]do[/i] come out, it's scary fun for both sides!

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Picked it up again in a wargame chain to help the list move along, and because I still really want to play this. I think it's just a part of the collection now since it fills an interesting niche (operational or strategic age of sail).

RATING: 8
This is an intriguing game.   The only flaw (for me) is the overly dark print run on the game map.   I've gone to the trouble of reworking the map with lighter colors so I can more easily read the thing while playing.  The game tends to be too good a simulation of blockade naval warfare, with long periods of time where both sides are locked in Sitzkrieg, waiting to make a move.   But once a move is made, it is quite exciting to chase the French across the ocean.   If you can leave the game set up over a period of time, both players can take their time making thoughtful moves.   The combat system in which players give orders for the sail state of their fleets as well as the type of wind-driven maneuvers is very innovative and is great fun.

RATING: 7
This is a very cleverly designed game and the designer has been successful in creating gameplay that evokes the Napoleonic naval era.  If you have some patience this game will reward you with an intriguing experience.  If you are playing the British you are trying to blockade the Allied fleet, and when he sorties out catch him with Nelson and the big three deckers.  If you are playing the Allies you will be biding your time, watching the movement of the British and attempting to sneak out of your ports to complete your missions.  A very unique game that takes some dedication but is a lot of fun. [b]Recommended, but you need a great deal of patience and an interest in the subject matter.[/b]

The rules to this game are terrible, and I mean terrible. They are so obtuse and so poorly organized, one has to wonder what the developer was thinking to release it as is.

I keep hearing that there is a good game in the box, but the initial experience with this one was so frustratingly bad, the game was shelved as I have no desire to struggle with it any further.

Oh, the purple map is god awful too.

Too much procedure and not enough actual decision making for me.
The whole of the weather and blockade system felt like a lot of work for very little output. Battles are to be avoided at all costs by the French. So in essence a wargame where one side really doesn't want to fight, and almost always gets hammered if made to. Wasn't for me.

Naval wargame with several interesting features:

Double blind
Variable game-turn length
Semi-known victory points
Asymetric set-up and strategy
Switching initiative
Historic-accurate battle matris

Put this together with an interesting historic situation and you get a very good game.

There is lots for both players to do, with multiple paths to victory or defeat.  Having read about many of the ancilliary actions/operations (much more happened than just Trafalgar), I was delighted to find all these options available to both players!   Not an easy game to get into (IMHO), but very rewarding once it "clicks".  Definitely of more interest to a fan of the period or history of the era, it is a very long game... better plan for at least two solid game sessions to complete it though.

A really good game if you enjoy a cat and mouse game where the French are trying to avoid the British fleets. There are a lot of things to like about this game, the hidden movement, battle chits the turn order, and secret objectives. The game is long and I think if you can leave it set up absolutely worth playing. There is a shorter scenario that came out in C3i issue #26.

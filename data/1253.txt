I like the scoring mechanic - in order to win you have to take risks, but you're more likely to lose points than gain them. Quite heavy memory requirements. Runs a little too long for my liking.

An amusing game where you have to try and add colours to the pot without exceeding the limit (set by the card, and reduced by face down cards, 1 per player). A good filler, quick and easy to play. Not a great deal of thought, more aimed at memory.

This was totally not on my radar, but a friend had it.  It was interesting, if maybe a bit long (though it was quick), and quite stressful.  I'm not good at bluffing, and I'm certainly not good at keeping up with what's already been played.  Still, it wasn't bad.

RATING: 7
I'm surprised this game doesn't receive more praise as an excellent filler card game.  My guess is that some people are bothered by the memory mechanism, however I don't find this to be that bad in the game.  Plus you could easily play with a running discard pile so you can see and count every card.  Either way I don't think the counting of cards is where the fun lies in this game.

What really drives this game, and makes it shine, is the bluffing aspect.  I love when you get to a certain point and everyone at the table knows that the base limit has been shattered, but no one knows how many people raised that limit.  The tension, when we reach that point, can often be cut with a knife.  Everyone wants to call the person, but no one wants to be penalized.  The one problem I have with the game is that it seems to have some runaway leader issues.  If one player gets a number of positive points it can be really hard to catch them.  And the scores seem ridiculously low.  But, despite these shortcomings, it is a fast fun game that I've always enjoyed playing.

Not quite there.  You just never exceed the limit in a color, and try really hard never to match it either (in case one of the other players put it face down).  After that, it's mostly just a guessing game.

Decent memory and bluffing game for people that don't count cards very well... also, since everyone gets to add one hidden card to the limit, card counters don't have a very big advantage.

RATING: 7.5
An enjoyable filler which works well - lots of groans and laughter, which is always a good sign.  The genius lies in requiring each player to chose a card to place face down each round to increase the limit for that colour - that is what makes the game really fly - turning it from what would otherwise be a dull memory exercise into a nice push your luck game.  The other nice feature is the potential to score points by collecting sets of cards - the downside of course being that you reduce your room for manoeuvre and increase your chances of landing in the doo doo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The tension here is always felt when someone plays a car that busts. You have to gauge if it's a legitimate bust or if there's a hole card keeping them safe. But, when you deliberately bust, you have to wonder if someone else's hole card will keep you safe, or fear of a hole card will keep you safe. Or maybe it's an easy move because you know your hole card is keeping you safe. And sometimes you just have to play it cool because you don't have a choice but to bust. Or you know you'll have no choice but to bust so you need to call someone out before your turn no matter what they play.

So, yeah, it's the game is all about those cards that are riding the limit. Are they safe? Not safe? Do you call? Not call? Can you get away with it?

And, when you do get away with it, I can tell you that it is one of the greatest feelings.

Simply put - this game is more fun that it really should be.  All you're doing is putting cards of various colors onto a discard pile, and trying to remember how many of each were played.

But the fiendish aspect to the game is the pressing your luck aspect - can you afford to play just one more over?  Has someone secretly increased the limit on that color?  Have the other players lost track of how many yellow cards have passed?  Can you get a matched set for an easy point?

This game won't be for everyone, but I for one am impressed.

Production: The highest-quality cards, but with artwork a bit too simple (except for the perfectly-functional limit cards).  Play: Rather silly.

What I liked:
* Guessing is fun and creates a lot of laughs
* The hidden card to raise the limits creates an interesting feel and adds to that whole guessing fun.

What I didn't like:
* The scoring. It doesn't work that well and kind of kills the "game" side.

Limits is a variant of Rosenberg's Mamma Mia that trades the almost perfect information of the latter for a bit of bluffing and double-guessing. While it is still based on memory and card counting this new twist quite generally makes it a more interesting game but its entirely themeless presentation also makes it appear very dry. The major disadvantage, however, is that it runs quite long, and quite a bit too long for a game that primarily consists of memorizing cards and taking chances.

Mixture of bluffing and "card couning" as players discard cards from their hand attempting to stay under the disclosed limit for that color on the limit card.

While 3 of us were sitting around at the Australian Games Expo #3 (2008), a distributor wandered over with a game he wanted our opinions on. This is a light, quick, bluffing card game. It played quickly and - like all good bluffing games - gave rise to cheers and groans as the game went on. We bought one for ourselves and one for the pressie cupboard, as did our opponent. Good going, Mr Distributor :)

This one is a contradiction, or maybe that's just me. Its clearly tending towards being a party/beer/wine game, yet the memory aspects really get you if you don't pay attention to things and are busy chatting. Some bluffing aspects, pretty colorful cards, plays well with a big group. All in all, an entertaining filler, but maybe not the one I'll reach for first.

Some games simply don't work with colourblind players! Limits is a very simple card filler. Cards are one of five colours. Each round a "Limit" card is turned over- it sets the number of cards of each colour that can be played that round. Each player secretly plays a card face down - these cards modify the limits for that round. Then players take turns playing cards face up - other players challenge when they believe you have gone past the (modified) limit. It should be fun, with a nice mix of push-your-luck and memory. It becomes somewhat more challenging when you can't tell the suits apart. In fairness, the designer has tried to use patterns on the cards to provide alternative means to distinguish them- they were too subtle for me.

RATING: 5
Liars dice style with cards with more emphasis on card counting than probability. And no elimination.
Update: Still a fun outing as players push the thresholds on colour quantities and when they reveal the actual limits. One of the rare games which plays well with 6, but the strong memory element means this should be an intro rather than end of evening fare. But my biggest gripe is the repetition (which makes it overstay its welcome) and the scoring which seems unfair. Maybe -1 for wrong accusations and +2 for getting it right, otherwise a few wrong turns will see you out of it, so elimination in another way.

Gyors, kártyás memóriajáték. 5 különböző színű lapból választva rakjuk folyamatosan a lapokat középre, amelyek száma színenként és körönként meg van határozva. Ha valaki úgy érzi valamelyik játékos többet rakott le az adott színből, akkor meggyanúsíthatja. Ha igaza van plusz, ha nem találta el mínusz pontot kap a gyanúsított pedig pont fordítva. Szeretem a kártyás játékokat, de ez valahogy nem igazán fogott meg.

RATING: 6
Simple, fast game of memory and bluffing. You'd think I could keep track of 5 colors of cards!

--- Summary ---
Deal each player 5 cards (show one of 5 colors), then reveal the top Limit Card. Limit Cards specify limits (0 - unlimited) for the number of allowable cards in each of the 5 colors. Players place one of their cards face down in front of them -- these will modify the limits, adding one per card played this round. In turn order, players either challenge a previous player's play, or play card(s).

Challenging: may "call" any player's last played card. Figure out which card they played last, and count how many of those cards have been discarded. Reveal all face-down cards and add those matching that color to the limit on the Limit Card. If the total exceeds the Limit, you get +1 VP and the challenged gets -2 VP; otherwise, vice versa.

After resolving a Challenge, flip discard pile face down and place under draw deck WITHOUT shuffling. Players return their Limit-modifying card to hand; reveal a new Limit card and play again (player who got the -2 VP plays first).

Playing Card(s): place a card to the discard pile, then draw a card. OR, if you have a set of 4 matching cards, you may draw 2, then discard 2 of the matches and place the other 2 matches on top of the draw deck; take a +1 VP card bonus.

Game ends after all Limit cards have been played; most VP wins!

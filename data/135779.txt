GAME: A Fake Artist Goes to New York
RANK: 868

RATING: 5
Interesting take on the werewolf hide in the crowd model. That each person gets two lines to draw (in turn order) and then everyone hashes out what they think someones reluctance to draw more (or badly) means. I enjoyed the games I've played, and there are some occasions where I'd prefer to play this over another in the same vein (e.g. Resistance) but it wouldn't be my first choice. Better with more folks.

The drawing at the end is almost as good as the discussion.

[b]Read my full review [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24062160#24062160]here[/url][/b]

I'm not generally fond of these 'activity' games, but Fake Artist is the first of the genre I could honestly say I enjoy. Unlike Cards against Humanity, you can make the game as benign or naughty as you wish. Unlike Telestrations, you're not relying on crummy whiteboards and clumsy thick markers, but the 'telephone' aspect is magnified even further in Fake Artist. Unlike Werewolf or Mafia, you're not eliminating players and neither do the games drag -- you can knock out a complete round in less than ten minutes! 

It compares to another very good game (Spyfall), but I prefer the drawing in Fake Artist, plus it avoids the fiddliness of having all the preset locations that the spy must guess at. 

Like so many social games, this one will depend on the people around you -- but when you're with a bunch of friends, time will fly by and you will crack up over the drawings that you've made. I guarantee it. This is fun in a box, and for 22 bucks, there are much worse games you could spend your money on. Is it as good as Deep Sea Adventure? I'd say yes, though in a different way. Both are an essential sort of filler game for different types of people, and I'm happy to have both in my collection. Plus, their little boxes are [i]so cute![/i]. 

Fake Artist is an ingenious little party game. Though I generally prefer to pass on party games, no other game breaks the ice so quickly and provides so much enjoyment in such a short time. Fake Artist owns the drawing genre completely. Recommended!

Really fun, little (about the size of a box of cigarettes!) game. Pictionary-by-committee with one person not knowing what the requested art piece is. The game can be broken by people trying to be subversive (they know what the art is but deliberately draw something that makes no sense, confusing everyone), resulting in awkward tie vote scenarios. The included rules are in Japanese, not English, so you have to download the English ones here. The rules for tie votes are not clearly addressed in the rough-translated English. (Basically, in the case of a tie vote, the Question Master and Fake Artist still get two points, though I'd house rule they only get one.)

The one element that would elevate this game to dynamite territory would be a deck of ideas-- be they the general art categories or specific things to draw. Some players struggled with coming up with an idea of something to draw, slowing down the game.

Positives
- Fantastic gameplay concept
- Adorable box and component design
- Works well with large groups (about ten, but not more)
- You don't really need the components to play the game (which is also bad), but the included dry erase tiles are very nice to have

Negatives
- Size of included paper pad is too small
- You don't really need the game's components to play the game... with potentially better paper and markers
- Rules are a little rough for edge scenarios
- No suggested topics/drawing ideas-- but you're only limited by your imagination! ;)

1st play: Refreshing - a fun little micro game that is simple and gets everyone involved.  It's essentially spyfall combined with pictionary and the result is a lot of fun.  Would work great with gamers and non-gamers alike.  It's a shame it's so expensive for what is essentially a few markers and some paper - but that's ok, easy to PnP this.  We played it like 6 times in a row back to back.

Fake Artist starts with the same premise as Spyfall; all but one of us has a piece of information and we're trying to trick the one who doesn't into revealing their ignorance.  We are supposedly all collaborating to create an image of something. Spyfall bothers me because it is really easy for a badly formed question or a careless answer to make an unsatisfying mess of a round.  Fake Artist reduces that risk somewhat by giving its players the simpler task of drawing a line. Still it is not fool proof; if a player selects too narrow a category, the round is too easy for the faker.  Fake Artist is a game as hilarious as Spyfall when that game works well - and it works well more reliably.

It's an ok game can be fun with the right amount and personality of people. But let's be honest. You can make this work on your own without getting the actual board game. So let's say its a neat idea, otherwise nothing special really. You play it once twice three times and if you are like me and like tactics, a bit more of thinking etc, you are probably already looking for something else to play....Components are also definitely not something to write home about!

Hilarious take on the whole spy theme. In this game you have to expose the fake artist among 'real' artists. The social aspect of deducting the 'spy' by not giving away too much information while not indicting yourself is a great party mechanic. Combining this with cooperatively drawing the object in question is a brilliant gimmick.

RATING: 7.5
Another nice one from Oink Games! It's kind of a weird take on a Pictionary-type drawing game. You're trying to draw well enough, but not too well in most cases. That way some people will hopefully know that you know the word while not giving it away to the fake artist. Well designed components, interesting game! My group enjoys this one quite a bit, and it handles a large group!

RATING: 8.5
[After 18 plays] Such a simple concept, yet amazing game.

I was afraid that this game simply cannot work, two passes are not enough for each player to contribute meaningfully, drawing would be really sketchy and not detailed enough, but boy, I was proved wrong.
Simple fact, that you are not limited to just drawing _straight_ lines (any complicated shape is allowed, even one forming Picasso-like masterpiece) resolves everything.

After trial game or two, creativity somehow start to flow freely from everyone and drawings takes form, which you would not expect just from reading game description.

Given that "Fake Artist" works great with minimal player count, takes only few minutes to play, have short, elegant rule-set and great compact factor, it is a perfect party game.

RATING: 7
I think I may prefer this a bit over Spyfall for my "one player has no clue what's going on but is trying to blend in" game.

The premise is that every player but one (the fake artist) knows what the group is trying to draw. Players take turns adding to the drawing bit by bit, each player having their own color pen so you can tell who drew what, and after two rounds of passing the drawing around and adding to it, players guess who the fake artist is.

If the real artists are correct in having the majority of them pick out the fake artist, those players may score a point. However, before they score, the fake artist has a chance to guess what the group was drawing. If he's correct, he scores points, and the real artists don't. So, there's a pretty hilarious balance in the real artists trying not to do too good a job, but good enough that no one thinks they're the fake artist.

Our group laughed after pretty much every single drawing contribution, so it was a really great time! A no-brainer party game.

RATING: 6
Another good small-box game from the publisher of Deep Sea Adventure. Similar to Spyfall but the fake artist is trying to find out what the other players are drawing without getting caught. The portability of the game is awesome so you could easily play at a pub with a group of people. The player count is a concern and will dictate how easy/hard it is for the fake artist. Definitely very hard with only 5-6 people. Definitely worth trying and also works great as an icebreaker!

Traded in Origins Math Trade 2017

A raucous good time. Lacks the instant replayability of Spyfall. I think it could be improved by drawing on a white board, because the paper pad they provide is quite small (and could still be used for traveling situations, or at parties outside your home). However, I think seeing everyone's drawing, as they do it, would significantly improve the immersion of the game, and make people request another after another after another...

It's SpyFall + drawing! Really clever and unique - guaranteed to have everyone laughing.

We found some people had trouble getting into the bluffing game mindset right away - they naturally would react to the title they'd been given, etc. in a way that made it obvious that... well, they had a title. So that may take some players a few games to really get their head around.

Like most party games, the scoring rules kind of only get in the way. Just from reading the rules it was immediately obvious that having the Question Master get points when the fake artist guesses the title correctly makes it way too easy to game the system by making the titles all super obvious/narrow. We just decided not to keep score and it was a blast.

It kind of seems like maybe players should score based on whether or not they guess correctly, anyway. The fun part of the deduction game is in correctly guessing the fake artist so it seems weird that that part isn't played up more in the scoring. Something like, if the fake artist is correctly identified, everyone who identified him gets X points? I suspect our group will experiment with a couple of different scoring schemes, but honestly, you don't need them.

Also holy crap! The box is SO TINY! The images on BGG didn't really give me a good idea of the size. It's adorable. I kind of wish it had come with a whiteboard instead of a pad of paper, though. Gonna go through this lightning fast!

This game replaces Spyfall. It scales player counts better as well. The only negative is that it can be quiet while playing. But it is easy to play anytime you have paper and multiple colors of writing utensils, allowing you to play almost anywhere with any group of people. The best part is probably still watching people's heads explode as they realize that they need to draw the subject well enough to be trusted while bad or obscure enough to confuse the fake artist.

A refreshing take on the Barbarossa, Dixit, Spyfall sort of game.  Players take turns contributing one line to a common picture - all players but one know what they are drawing, and the fake artist is trying to deduce what they are drawing without giving away that they are the fake artist.  If they can conceal their identity, or guess the drawing, they get 2 points, otherwise the artists get 1 point.  

Very simple to create a home brew version of this game.  Charming - I'd rather play this over Dixit any day.

The QM's clue should be easy enough for the fake artist to guess, but not the most obvious choice in the category that could be guessed without seeing any art at all. For example, "food: salad" is good, but "dinosaur: t-rex" would be too easy and "mammal: leaf-nosed bat" would be too hard.

In some ways it could be argued it is more of an activity than a game, but in some settings this is exactly the kind of thing you need, especially when you don't take it too seriously and have a lot of laughs - which we certainly did! Very entertaining - even if I am rather useless at being a fake artist!

This fell flat for me which was a big surprise. I was ready to love it as I love Telestrations, Spyfall, and Pictionary. But here the scoring was wonky such that we never felt like there was a game afoot and anything was at stake. 

As a result, it became just an activity, which can be fine but we weren't having great heaps of laughter like we do at Telestrations. After we made some overly obvious drawings, we started making the images much harder for the fake artist to understand, and it worked so well that we always knew who the artist was and they had no clue what the image was. It wasn't the sillycrazeefun it should have been.

Actually I really enjoy this one. The scoring system is a little off in that if you are the fake artist more often you will have a higher score, but that said this is an interesting enough activity that I really do not care for the scoring aspect.

Initially we found it difficult to pinpoint the fake artist however we quickly began to get more obscure in our drawings, i.e a crown for ruler, and a bottle for a dolphin. The connections being quite obvious it you know the word but fiendishly difficult if you do not.

A fun party game. Whereas Spyfall did not work for me this one does. You have enough control over the drawing to determine how much you want to show you know the subject and yet still not give any clues to the fake artist.

Great fun when you have a big crowd. This is  a game where all the artist know what they are drawing but there is one artist who knows just the general category and must pretend to draw the same communal picture. If he is found out and can't guess the picture all the other artists get 1 point. If he gets away with it he gets 2 points.

This game is heavily weighted in favor of the fake artist, so you have to go into it knowing that. It delivers a lot of similar moments to Spyfall with about a quarter of the tension when you're the fake artist/spy. I prefer Spyfall, but I can get others to play this more regularly.

I love this game and its wonderful production. Similar to Spyfall but with drawing instead of talking, the result is something special. The players are making a drawing one line at the time - but one doesn't know what they're drawing, and he's trying not to stand out. 

Wonderfully produced, lovely components. So lovely that I don't want to ruin them and will probably make a travel version that the players can ruin at their will.

This is "Spyfall with drawing," but IMO it blows away Spyfall, in part because -- even though it involves drawing! -- it doesn't relay as much on the players being creative. I played this with adults and initially rated it a 7; with kids it's a 9 (they tend to *love* both the drawing and the accusing), thus my rating of 8. 

The con is that each round one player has to run the game and sit out, but this is alleviated by games being super-quick.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2017)

I wasn’t expecting anything good from A Fake Artist Goes to New York. I hate drawing games, the only one I like and own is Pictomania (from genius designer Vlaada Chvátil) but A Fake Artist Goes to New York really surprised me.

The rules of the game are pretty simple. You can explain the game under 2 minutes. 

The game is expensive for what comes in the small box (as are all Oink Games), the components are ok. 

Gameplay is very fun. It works just like Spyfall (a game I love). A game Master select a category and a word and all players will contribute to this drawing but there is one player (fake artist) who doesn't know what he is supposed to draw. Players win if the fake artist doesn’t guess the drawing and he wins if he do guess it correctly.. As I´m terrible at drawing, it was very fun to try to convince my fellow players that I wasn’t the fake artist, cool game. 

From my limited perspective, the fake artist has a hard time guessing the correct word, but the game ends in about 5 minutes so that´s ok.

Bottom line, A Fake Artist Goes to New York was a surprise game and I liked it. I´m not sure if it has the legs to resists repeat plays, but for now I´m enjoying it a lot. My lack of drawing abilities makes the game better for me. I will probably buy it. It is a borderline 7.0 to me though.

This falls into the Spyfall school of deduction party games where everybody is in on the joke except one person and they need to make everyone else think they are in on it as well. In Fake Artist, one player picks and topic and put a specific item from that topic on small placards for the other players. On one placard she puts an "X", which indicates the fake artist. The player choosing the topic can also choose who the fake artist is or deal it randomly. Then everyone proceeds to draw one line of a picture depicting the item, with the fake artist trying to figure out what it is and adding their own lines as if they knew. When everyone has added two lines, then everyone simultaneously points to who they think the fake artist is. Points are then awarded in a fairly mysterious manner.

You either have the right group to have fun with this or you don't. An example of having the right group: in one of our rounds the topic-picker chose animals as the topic and I was given the "X". The subject of the drawing? Me.

Someone writes a clue on all but one card and passes them out the players. If you get the blank you are the fake artist. Players then take turns drawing a line (not necessarily a straight one) on a pad of paper with their player specific coloured marker. The pad is a communal art project, each person adds a line, together they are drawing the clue. The fake artist has to draw a line as well, but they don't know what is being drawn. The pad goes around the table twice and then people vote on who the fake artist is.

Simple and interesting. Having to write down the same clue on multiple cards is a bit onerous, and what constitutes a correct guess by the fake artist is ill defined. Those small issues aside this game was a lot of fun. It's fun to hear people's thoughts after the game. What were they doing when they added THAT line?!? Much laughter ensues :D

Un party en el que el "master" da al resto de jugadores la misma palabra de forma oculta, excepto a uno que le pone una "X". De modo que todos saben qué tienen que dibujar excepto el "falso artista".

Por orden, y durante 2 rondas, van dibujando en el mismo papel, una parte de lo que representa la palabra que tienen escrita (por ejemplo, un león). El falso artista deberá intentar no ser descubierto. Luego hay una votación a ver quién cree cada uno que es el falso artista.

Sencillísimo y bastante divertido, sobre todo por lo mal que dibujamos xD

The game is so interesting. 
It takes a unique spin on the hidden role where players essentially are trying to determine the liar, but the only information they can give one another is a drawn line.

There is a wonderful contradiction at play, where giving away too much obfuscates the liar, and giving too little puts you in suspicion.

It can even work with people who cannot lie!

Spyfall/Agent Undercover-rel egy kalap, de itt rajzolni kell!! Zseniális! Előnye, hogy külföldiekkel is tudtuk játszani, nem kell hozzá csak papír, és színes filckészlet (beruháztam rá). Nomeg persze némi képzelőerő! Nagyon izgalmas látni, ahogy alakul a mű, aminek persze csak minimális köze van a megfejtéshez (jó esetben). És persze az elvontság miatt itt is rendszeres a zavarodottság és a végén a kérdőre vonás; ez meg mi?? Ide meg mit rajzoltál? 7-en játszottuk eddig maximum, és úgy azért már nem kis kihívás van benne, hogy valami újat hozzá tegyünk. Ennek ellenére szerintem sokaknak egyszerűbb, mint a Titkos Ügynökös, bár számomra itt sokkal nehezebb hamis művészként meghúzódni. Kidumálni sokkal könnyebb bármit, mint egy vonalat jó helyre húzni (nem mindig jön be a szimmetria :D).

Lovely, ingenious party drawing game with elements of Heimlich & Co. Giving very easy clues is a boring way to win the game, but winning is secondary. The game qua activity is delightful.

on a second play, the fun factor kind of drained away. As a game to be won, where's the incentive not to have as a category, "Two-letter animals that begin with O and end with X"? As an activity, why not play Eat Poop You Cat? Downgrading from 8, but bonus points for the lovely box.

I'm not sold on cryptic clues as a genre. A game using such creates interest but I'm not sure it adds enough fun to counter the requisite downtime. If clues aren't worked out, all it offers is dissatisfaction. And that's the overriding feeling I got here. Each person is trying to give a cryptic clue in the form of a shape or figure or symbol or some such to indicate to their team that they really do know what the answer is, while trying to ensure that the one person who doesn't know what the answer is won't be able to guess it. So people generally err on the side of too-cryptic. Each subsequent round got more and more cryptic and less and less fun. There's a workable base of a game in here, and I'm sure many people would likely enjoy it, but it fell flat for me.

RATING: 7
A Fake Artist Goes to New York is a social deduction game based on drawing.  The players are trying to guess which player is the spy, who is on the same team as the clue-giver.  The clue-giver names a category and writes down a specific thing to draw on each of the players' cards except for the spy.  The players then, in turn order, draw one line or curve on the collective drawing, and after two times around, they try to guess the spy.  If the players fail to identify the spy, or if the spy can guess what is being drawn, then the spy and the clue-giver win, otherwise the players win.  So basically, the players are trying to draw just enough so that the other players know they're not the spy, but not enough so that the spy can guess what it is, while the spy is just trying to continue the drawing without knowing what is being drawn.  It's an interesting tension in the game, and I think it works well.

I think it's a neat idea, but I'm not so sure on the implementation. I think that with the right group, luring out the impostor to make contributions that give them away can be really clever (making obvious contributions is highly suspicious, so you want to lure them out by giving them things they can work off of, since they're the only one who can't work independently).

This is so much more fun and clever than it has any right to be.

The first few plays of this were very lukewarm. I am a bit disappointed, but maybe I expected too much from what is essentially a werewolf-pictionary hybrid. Clever design: it does what it does well, it just gets old after a while. Possibly group dependent so I am willing to try again.

(+) Some opportunity for slyness as the fake artist.
(+) Clever "unspoken" synergy between the clue giver and the fake artist is rewarded.
(+) Plays quick, easy to learn, accessible.

(-) Groupthink can sort of ruin the experience if the players do not understand the need to mislead the fake artist.
(-) Amusing but can get repetitive unless given clues are interesting.
(-) More of an activity than a game.

A delight to play for a wide range of players.  It is interesting in any of the roles.  It's neat to try to figure out how to both look honest yourself while trying to draw out the impostor, all while drawing bad artwork.

It's not a deep game, but it is much closer to being strategic for a game about collectively drawing bad art.

The biggest drawback is that it needs a high player count to work.  So, while I want to play it a lot, I likely won't get to.

The compact package is really impressive, but the game requires a little bit of hand-holding because it doesn't come with suggestion cards. There's also a definite sweet spot for players: too many and it becomes unmanageable, and too few and it's almost too heady. In the middle though it's a nice ride, although you may be better off using the included pens on normal-sized paper.

Pictionary meets Dixit and brings a Werewolf friend. Tried this with a mockup (pulling slips of paper from a hat instead of cards). Great fun, only caveat is a little downtime as the question master makes up a category and title and writes it down several times. Maybe everybody should use the time to make up their own title beforehand so they only need to write it down when it's their turn as question master.
Please Iello, hurry up bringing this to the rest of the world! I want chunky wipeable tiles!

Some people love it. I think it's complete nonsense. Sure it's nonsense that will get the odd laugh, but as a game it fits into the social "We've got nothing to talk about, so let's play a game" category. I'd rather find something to talk about or find a real game.

Draw bits of an object. Try and find out who's bluffing and has no idea what the object is without drawing too much of the object collectively. Guess who was bluffing. If you're keeping score then you've missed the point.

Often calles as Spyfall meets Pictionary there's actually more to like about this game then the Spyfall itself. If you don't know yet: in both games all players but one share an information the other person tries to figure out, while the players try to find the "fake"/"spy". Spyfall has a predetermined set of locations and then uses a timer and a talk (question/answer) to figure out who is who and where we are. 

Fake Artist does it simpler, at the same time leaving more to the players. It add another role - the Qeustionmaster who sets the task. They decide on a category (public knowledge) but then give away specific task to everybody but the fake artist. However - they are on the side of the Fake artist (!). The game also only lasts two rounds and the voting is simpler and elegant.  

But instead of question/answer format the players collectively draw whatever the task was (category: animal, specific thing: penguin), each having a different coloured pen. 

The nature of both games transforms informantion in an interesting way. Those who know the task/location try to signal those who know that they know as well without making it obvious to the fake/spy what's going on. The spy/fake tries to blend in and deduce the missing info. This gives a certain modernistic/cubist feel to the overall content. Where Spyfall conversations feel like something Beckett or Ionesco would write ([i]Where were you before? At home. What brought you here? The usual [/i]) Fake Artist's pictures give a definite cubist feel, of something Braque would paint. And it's more interesting to giggle at cubistic paining than to endure Beckettian dialogue (I did laugh there as well, I mean I was a spy, I had to blend in).

Social deduction pictionary variant.  While drawing a picture one stroke at a time, players try to identify the fake artist who has no idea what they are drawing.  The scoring system of this game is fairly breakable, and it is therefore probably best played without concern for points.  That said, this is a fun little microgame that is going straight into my travel bag.

Let me preface this by saying unless you are interested in supporting the publisher/designer of this game do not bother buying it.  The rules are very good and clever and deserving of your support but nothing outside of the rules themselves are necessary to play the game.

The game plays much like Spyfall but with a drawing element in place of the questions.  A game master announces a category then writes a word from that category on each of these tiles except one on which he puts an X.  The tiles are passed out randomly and players take turns making one line on a piece of paper.  The goal, like Spyfall, is to prove you are not the fake artist while also not giving too much away.  The fake artist is trying not to give himself away and also determine the word.

I like Spyfall better, the simplicity of the questions just works better for me.  I know people who prefer this method better though, and it is a nice variation on the formula.

RATING: 8
It seems to be very hard for the Artists to win, because it's very hard to draw thing so specific that it's clear to the other artists you know what the subject is, but not obvious enough that the Fake Artist will. There might be a bit of a trick to it though. Like, perhaps not drawing the thing itself, but drawing tightly related things or something?

Out of the 5 times I've played it (well, 4 really, I just supervised the first time), the Artists only won once, and that was with 10 players. Even so, I think this seems to work better with fewer players. With ten players, it ended up with a lot of players just drawing a short line as part of a bigger item, which basically made it impossible to guess the Fake Artist, since it could be any one of several players.

But overall, I'm giving this game a high rating, because we had a great time, and there was a lot of laughter over both the drawings and the subjects.

Party game somewhere between Telestrations and Spyfall: all players but one know what they are collaboratively drawing, one line at a time, and after twice around the table must pick which is the "fake artist".

The rules as written seem to be broken (insofar as there is a degenerate strategy for the question master), but as a party game that is all bit irrelevant. I don't know why you would play it over Eat Poop You Cat/Telestrations but it's enjoyable enough.

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly good game based on the 'everyone is in but 1 and you figure out who it is' principle.

Three basic strong points going for it:
- easy to pick up, requires almost no explanation
- sheer amount of fun, as even the people drawing often don't know the idea behind what is drawn before them, and the resulting pictures are great examples of how you DON'T draw such an item. Maybe it is our imperfect drawing skills, but we all had tears of laughter playing this game, which is EXACTLY the feeling a filler should bring
- small box. In fact, so compactly packed it requires more thought packing it as playing it. Which is absolutely great as this means a highly portable party game. As a gamer enthousiast, I value also shelf-space and hence wasted air in boxes (yes AEG and FFG, I'm looking at you here). Great job Oink games! 

Great filler, pleasantly surprised so far by the Oink games package (after the equally excellent Deep See Adventures). Keep up the good work.

Slightly better than Spyfall but has a lot of the same issues. Spyfall becomes incredibly repetitive and it's very hard for the spy to win. This game is very repetitive in the sense that the "spy" will just make a simple line or mirror somebody else's shape every time. In this game it's hard for the non-spies to win.

Like Spyfall, it just doesn't deliver the fun that it attempts to.

Having played this game recently, it was fun, but I didn't find it all that amazing. I think for myself, the group size we played with, seven I believe, seemed a bit large, there was too much that could be drawn so the fake artist could almost always win. This game would do better with a bit more thought into the rules, but I'm not sure how personally.

One of those 'how has this not been done before' games. One clue giver. One fake artist and a bunch of real artists each round. The real artists know what it is they are drawing on a shared piece of paper by drawing one line each round. The fake is trying to blend in without knowing what it is they are trying to draw. The problem being that if the fake works out what the clue is then they win. So draw, without being obvious but without drawing suspicion. Spyfall with pens. Great.

This game is tough to describe. Our group had fun playing it, but it was frustrating as well at a certain level. In our 8 rounds of playing this game with 8, the game dragged quite a bit. The biggest issue however, was that in all 8 rounds, the fake artist was never discovered. Granted, all the players may have been lousy at this game, but we noticed that there just weren't enough guidelines for drawing the clues. For example, are you allowed to draw abstracted figures or objects instead of the actual thing. For example, can you draw stars and planets while instead of the starship? Can you draw underpants while the clue is an undergraduate? My feeling is that you should not be allowed to do so. However, it was incredibly tough to pick out the fake artist.

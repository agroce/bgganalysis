I initially bounced off this game and shelved it as a basic math optimization problem. 

After working my way through Onirim, Sylvion, and Castellion, I decided to go back and give Shadi's Equilibrium another chance.

This time, I fell into it like cement. It is, still, a basic math optimization problem. But, there are nuances to it that give it just enough reason to play. 

The artwork was done by Élise Plessis and is beautiful. The simplicity and straightforward nature of the game will be shaken by the 'Chaos' denizens. And, you will not always win... 

I appreciate the nature of this game and have enjoyed it very much as a solitaire game.

Similar to Onirim, solitaire, the artwork is amazing and you can get a lot of rule variations of the game in the same box, a cute little game all-in-all that I wouldn't be worried breaking out on a plane (not much space needed to play it at all)

RATING: 5.5
Nice artwork and theme but more of a solo game with a 2 player cooperative variant tacked on.  Good that they included expansions in the base game (although that's a bit generous to say that included a handful of cards counts as an expansion).  The main issue is that it's basically a counting game that relies on knowing the distribution of cards before hand, so not a great deal of skill, more memory and maths. Good game for travelling although even then I'd prefer something that's more enjoyable and involves less brain power.

RATING: 6.5
Nowhere as good as Onirim and insanely difficult mostly due to randomness.

I feel that Onirim's deck generally evens out so you can plan ahead a bit, especially if you've got a key up your sleeve. No such thing in this one you're stuck with drawing whatever comes up and there's too many differing numbers and symbols on the card to bother keeping track of what you've discarded.

Still pumped for whatever Shadi Torbey comes up with next though ! I may even buy a second edition of the game if an expansion that allows some luck mitigation is included.

I really love Onirim, so I had high expectations for Urbion. However, it hasn't left me satisfied so far. In Onirim, there is a lot of math involved, but the game also forces you to make a lot of tough decisions as you try to manage the deck and avoid nightmares. In Urbion, the game is even more math-y, but the difficult decisions are gone. There is no way to manage the deck. The game is mostly a simple draw a card and play a card game. It isn't terrible, and I enjoy playing it occasionally, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor.

Another fun solo outing in the Omniverse series. In this game, you have to put cards with positive or negative numbers on either side of a city to try to get the total to 0 to claim the card. Complications are the fact that only cards with certain symbols can be played on cities that have that symbol. Also, bad cards make you add a + or - 5 to a city or worse. I think this is tougher than Onirim (at least the base version of Onirim) but easier than Sylvion. This series has been a hit for me and I eagerly await the next game for me to play, Castellion.

After getting back into Onirim a bit, I'm adding this to my wishlist - I typically don't like solo games, but Onirim is really fun. Not sure when this'll ever be published in the states due to the name problem, but if/when it shows up, I'll buy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Not nearly as good as Onirim, IMO, especially as a two-player game. The fact that there aren't any special cards/suits with discard powers makes this feel kind of generic and bland. I feel like Onirim has more timing decisions, with strategy spanning several turns in advance, whereas I felt this was purely tactical from turn-to-turn (I'm sure more experienced players will disagree with me!). It is nice that there's no shuffling. I have yet to try the "inspansions."

RATING: 7
Definitely more mathy and a little less fun than Onirim to me. You are trying to balance cards on each side of the city so they equal zero. As with Onirim there are cards in the deck that make it harder, but unlike it no cards (keys in Onirim) that give you a minor advantage. Yes you can discard a card to swap cards around without paying attention to the symbols, but it's only 1 swap and does not afford nearly as much strategic planning as Onirim in my opinion. You must clear all 12 cities before the 72 card deck runs out in order to win. I've played it a number of times now and still have not won. It does play fast and provides a unique challenge with a single deck of cards. This is definitely a keeper.

Really nice balancing game with plenty of tough decisions. Game play is quick. Art work is kind of dark but I actually quite like it. 

Only detraction is the rules layout is a little strange. Basically page 3 of the rules is on the back of the expansion rules set and is easy to miss.

Solo variant is quite hard and I suspect two player will be more difficult. 

Different enough to onirim to warrant keeping both.

Another intriguing solitaire card game by Torbey. Definitely tastes of Onirim, a la "push your luck while the deck runs out". However, this is a completely different game. Tension builds as you try to balance the forces of good and evil dreams upon 12 cities. The designer did a great thing with set collection in Onirim and replicates his success here, but with a math mechanic. Simple math, but this ain't no kid's game! Enough options available for some strategic depth. I feel like Onirim is the better game because less probability and number crunching makes it more fluid. But in Equilibrion you don't have to keep shuffling over and over! It's a bid dry and at its worst, plodding, but at its best it is thinky and a pleasing solo game.  The two included mini-expansions also add something and I especially recommend The Books of Power which give the game some needed flair.  So, overall, a success!

A very poor successor to the impressive Onirim. Urbion is a boring game with very few meaningful decisions. There is no sense of tension or excitement or accomplishment, unless you get a thrill out of doing simple subtraction problems. It feels like there isn't enough nuance or depth to the game. There is often literally nothing to do except discard cards until you can use the one rather obvious tool in your toolbox (swapping cards). The first expansion adds more tools, but these tools make the game far too easy to win. The second expansion doesn't do much.

I also dislike the look of the game. The childish art that was so charming in Onirim just looks messy this time.

RATING: 7
Equilibrion (truly a better name for this game than Urbion), is a solitaire/co-op game of balancing cards during your one time through the Dream deck.

Negative and Positive dreams must balance in each city section, before the Chaos (Nightmare) cards destabilize your efforts and you run out of cards.

Unlike Onirim, the deck is shuffled one time- less card wear and tear and less time wasted, both improvements- and like Onirim you need to try to plan plays based on cards in hand, cards seen and cards anticipated.

Afer about 4 plays (all the with base game rules so far), I have to say that the base Urbion game makes a better, more challenging solitaire than base Onirim.

Like Onirim, the 1st edition has a couple of expansions which appear to make the base game more difficult.

The art is reminiscent of Onirim; some like it a lot, some hate it, most seem to think it conveys something of the fuzzy, light/dark feelings of dreams. If you dislike Dixit art, this one (and Onirim) probably won't sit any better with you.

Starting this at a 7.25- I am really glad to see this finally appear on the market, because Shadey Torbey designs good little card games, and I like his style of game design, all art questions aside.

After several more plays I have yet to break into the expansion rules for this one, but I am finding that the deck and the quality of play seems somewhat more governed by chance than by skill as I return to this one, so I am knocking it down a quarter to 7.

This still makes a decent solitaire game, but I wanted to have more control than I seem to achieve when playing.

Shadi's games have interesting art, but the art is busy to the point of making it hard to see the symbology at times. This game moreso than Onirim. The basic game for Urbion is, I think, a little more interesting than the basic game for Onirim, but Onirim has better expansions that I think make it, overall, a slightly more satisfying experience. Both are decent solitaire games that I like to take with me traveling. They are easy to set up and play. 

The main challenge I have playing these games (Onirim and Urbion have similar enough game play share the same comment) is the various options that you have around drawing bad cards or discarding. Usually you have a range of 3 or more choices about what to do when these things happen, and they always seem difficult to remember. I always have to play these games with the rules at my right elbow.

English edition ("Equilibrion"), perfect condition. Trade interest: low.

A very nice little game with pretty artwork; similar, but inferior to Onirim as a 2-player game: it seems impossible to win without communication between players, which to me is the main appeal of Onirim, where guessing what your partner might want works well and gives the game a unique feel.

I was hoping for a game as good as Onirim that took away the annoying amount of shuffles Onirim requires. The game is very smooth to play, there isn't a lot of fiddling around like there is in Onirim. Unfortunately the gameplay itself is lacking. You are completely stuck with the luck of the draw. There is literally nothing you can do sometimes other than discard over and over and over. There is no way to plan ahead for the bad cards either which is terrible. I plan on writing a negative review after a few more plays but I'm having a hard time wanting to play this stinker again.

Shadi Torbey with a clever follow-up to "Onirim".  A nice little solitaire.  The set of likely outcomes is strongly a function of initial deck makeup, and how well you can mitigate/plan around the Chaos cards.  The earlier and oftener they are revealed, the better.

One of, if not the, hardest Oniverse games.  The unrelenting nature of the deck and the delicate balance that must be maintained make for a tense game.  Also, the push-your-luck aspect of trying to balance all four rows to maximize your efficiency has bitten me far more that it helps me, and yet, I can't help myself!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
there's a surprising number of "moving parts" in this game considering that it's just two decks of cards. You have to remember to match elements when you play a card and you have to keep your eye on things like balance and swapping cards. There there's deciding how to deal with the Chaos cards. Very entertaining and definitely more brain-burny than Onirim, its sister game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Traded away. Nearly impossible. Balancing number game, but the chaos cards are crazy. I think I played at least ten times 1p and ten 2p, and won once or twice. Not something I want to play again.

RATING: 6
At present but mostly in the light of other successes in the line, Urbion falls flat.  I love the theme and how it represents itself in the mechanics, but despite all the simple similarities to Onirim, the game feels more like simple card counting than problem solving.  Onirim is a game where you are trying to walk a line while the game tries to throw your balance and ends up feeling like a journey.  Urbion on the other hand feels like balancing way to many objects while someone is throwing more at you so it feels like doing inventory.  Perhaps it just takes more time for the game to resolve itself to a level of mechanical simplicity or perhaps some of the expansions help give the player a bit more hope.  Time will tell.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  I'm struggling with this one.  Onirim is a big favorite of mine for solo play, so this game by the same designer came with a lot of anticipation for me.  So far, it hasn't lived up to the hype I pushed upon it.  And maybe that's my fault.

So far, I haven't gotten a strong sense of choice in this game.  You are basically playing positive value cards on one side of the play area and negative values on the other.  If you can make the rows balance to zero, you capture the city card that is in between them.  Capture all the cities and you win.

You need to manipulate the cards on each side of the cities, but it doesn't give me a lot to ponder.  You've got 6 points on one side, get 6 points on the other.  Not a brain burner.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not winning this game left and right.  It's not easy in that sense.  I just don't get much satisfaction from the choices I'm making.

I haven't given up hope yet.  I keep playing, waiting for it to "click" with me.  Keep your fingers crossed.

A decent enough game but a pale shadow of its older sibling Onirim both in gameplay (dry, mechanical) and artwork (more off-puttingly childish than pleasingly child-like). I had difficulty winning until I started to keep an inventory of all the discards: not really my idea of fun. Have yet to try the two expansions that came with the game. [17 plays; traded]

Update: Borrowed it from a friend and raised my rating a point after separately trying the two expansions: in my limited experience the 1st seems to make the game easier while the 2nd makes it harder. [10 more plays so 27 total]

If Ur was my personal 2-player 10 game, this would currently be my personal solo 10 one. Played numerous rounds already - both at home and on the plane to Boston - and never tired of the mechanics. Didn't even mind having to constantly discard cards - beginning to think this is Shadi Torbey's M.O. anyway. Will definitely always travel with this game in my bag.Thinking of even getting it its own special case...

I have tried this a couple if times solo and can't really face playing it again. I feel that solitaire games need a pretty strong theme and this is totally abstract. I quite like Onirim, but that is much more intuitive and flows very quickly. This seems very clunky and static. If I wanted a puzzle of this sort I would probably do sudoku instead.

Similar in feel to Onirim, but instead of instead of creating sequences to open Doors, you're balancing sums on both sides of Cities, and the only shuffling performed in Urbion for the game setup. Urbion might be slightly gamier because of the opportunities of more choices. I recommend.

The included expansions are good, too. I have not tried the 2-player, yet.

"Extremely clever solo or 2p co-op card game. I like the balancing (and not shuffling) better than Onirim, but my wife is put off by the numeric focus of Urbion. A bit of a brain-burner."

What I like:
- Small solo/co-op card game
- Smooth play, with lots of interesting decisions
- No in-game shuffling

What I don't like:
- The focus on numbers is a bit abstract for my tastes

I felt like Onirim was about 70% luck, where I feel like Urbion is more like 20%. A few games in, I feel like I am just starting to explore the depths. And that's without yet touching the expansions, or the co-op mode.

Solo games are hit and miss for me.  Typically I'll try them out the day I get them and then promptly forget I own them.  Urbion isn't really an exception to this rule.  The concept is interesting and the art is undeniably well done, but, like Klondike, there's very little actual decision making from a strategic standpoint.  Mostly what you're doing is adjusting tactically to what card you draw. And doing arithmetic to calculate the cards you have out.  I despise arithmetic.
So, while the idea is intriguing, this isn't a game I'd likely play very much.  I'm glad I own it, but think I'd rather play Friday or SOS Titanic if I must play a solo.

I can't quite tell how I feel about this one, to be honest; I call it my "hate f*ck." At first I didn't care for it because it didn't feel as "full" as its sister game Onirim. That's on me -- expectations can kill you. I played a handful of times and the deck didn't have much left to it at the end of the game, and that basically told me that the game is a push-your-luck game without much margin for error; you simply have to double- and triple- and quadruple-up on claiming cities. 

But the way that the game frustrates that quadruple-claiming is through the Chaos cards, the cards that imbalance either the left or right by +/- 5 each time. To win this game you must count cards and also be terribly, terribly lucky. 

I've only ever played this with the first expansion, and it's OK, but the cost of two cards per special ability is steep, and adds an additional push-your-luck element since you can't consciously try to synergize cards, but rather you hope they go together when you flip them at the start. I prefer to simply select two or three cards I like and that work together, pay for them as normal, and then play. 

I now view this as a solo push-your-luck, "let's just see what happens" mindless card-flipping game, and I generally play this on the floor of my office when I'm having lunch or taking a break. I have heard rumors that the game will appear in the larger Zman box size as a second edition in the 6-game Oniverse series, and I'm wondering if it'll come slightly reworked, or with a couple extra expansions. I really don't see this getting re-released as-is, as it's not nearly as satisfying as Onirim or Sylvion (the only other Oniverse games I've played to date). If it does *not* get reworked, it'll likely be the worst game of the six, and, oddly, quite likely my most played since it requires the least amount of setup, table space, and brain commitment. I told you it was my hate f*ck.

Seems like a balanced solo game.  I'm not sure what the theme is  as I don't even understand it.  The cards although artistically great they are very cluttered and difficult to play with and again I just don't get the theme.  Basically your  balancing cards via placement and manipulation on either side of a line to gain city cards.   Get all the cards before the deck runs out and you win.  That all being said it a good solo game that fits in the quick solo game like solitaire or onirim.  Okay to pass the time I suppose.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The successor to Onirim.  A little bit more mathy but I enjoy that.  Lots of difficult decisions, revolving around discarding from hand with the risk of drawing Chaos cards.  I think that Chaos cards cause less problems than Onirim's Nightmares and have yet to lose a game (although it did take me a number of plays to get the rules down pat).  Have yet to look at the in-game expansions but they will no doubt be rolled in soon enough.  Again, will likely be playing this for a long time to come.

I also own and like Shadi Torbay's other game Onirim. Urbion is to me a more lively option where I enjoy the flow of the game and don't feel the need to keep track of what cards have been played so carefully - which is essential to win Onirim.

I haven't won yet after about 6 plays - maybe I should start playing a little more methodically - but I am having a lot of fun just trying to get that perfect balance of all 4 city cards. "Just one more card and I'll get it." No ideas for the end game yet but I dare say I'll get to that when I have had my fill of juggling.

Distinctive art work makes this a "keeper" that I can see playing for years to come.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple game with some neat subtlety.  Deciding when to score cities or when to hold onto them is non-obvious, and dealing with the chaos cards offers some touch choices too.

That said, I find it too repetitive and the end game too random.  The mid game has some tradeoffs, but when you get close, you lose options and just wait until you get lucky or lose.

At first it might seem like an exercise in simple arithmetic, however after a couple of plays you start to notice that your best laid plans are akin to juggling several balls in the air at once. You find yourself concentrating on the task and your planning and memory begin to be stretched. Your mind begins to feel like the artwork looks. Well, okay, some games end up being ridiculously easy, while others are nail biters right down down to the wire. It's better than it first looks, but ultimately the theme and artwork let the game down for me. It doesn't quite reach the high standard Friday set, but as a quick 10 minute mental workout it's worth a spin every once in a while.

Tricky little solo/co-operative card game. Similar to its predecessor 'Onirim', this game is set in the world of dreams and requires players to establish a balance between two types of card depicting positive and negative versions of those dreams. To do this the dream cards, which feature different +/- numbers, are placed on opposite sides of city cards. In order to claim the city cards the numbers on the dream cards have to balance out at zero. Once all 12 city cards have been claimed, the game is won. The difficulty of the game is knowing how best to place the dream cards and to optimise them as once the deck has run out the game is lost. This is a pretty tense game as you see the ever decreasing dream card deck quickly running out and wish you'd played your dream cards more sparingly. As with 'Onirim' the game features the same unique artwork, which is quite childlike in its attempt to illustrate dreams - I guess some people will really like it and others will not.

Picked this up at Origins since I was a fan of Onirim and the art style. Big disappointment. From a personal perspective, I quickly grew tired of constantly reminding myself to play cards only on Symbols that I had in my hand. Since the symbols are difficult to see (surprisingly), I constantly caught myself strategizing around plays that I couldn't legally make.

After about six plays, I decided to try the expansion with meta cards and the dual polarities were absolutely frustrating to the point that I rage-quit. I very rarely ragequit any game, but having to hold cards sideways to read them while still playing the right suits? Mind-bending and not in a good way.

Also, got stuck many times discarding ineffectually because I had all one polarity in my hand, or no cards with the right symbols. The strategic tension of the draw is completely eliminated when you can't do anything. Needs a version with some revised rules; maybe the translation is botched cuz something is off here.

(Something was off. Re-arranged the way I play the cards to the table and tried again without the dual cards. Enjoyed it a lot. Once I watched a Joel Eddy video review, I felt much more confident that I had the rules correct.

Still have to check the rules for the Chaos options. Graphic design is still terrible. But, the game is 10X more interesting and tight. Still potential for bad draws, but I felt better about it all. I had only kept it in my collection since it was tiny.)

[floatright][ImageID=1599589][/floatright][thing=94389][/thing] is a light solo game made by the same designer of [thing=71836][/thing] - Shadi Torbey. But, I guess that for many people is just as important that the artist is the also same: Élise Plessis. Mainly because is Élise that sets the tone for [thing=71836][/thing] and, in [thing=94389][/thing] even more: the dream-like scenery, the weird and beutiful blended together. Now, except for the theme and art, [thing=94389][/thing] is very different from [thing=71836][/thing].

In [thing=94389][/thing] you are trying to balance cities, playing Sognae cards on one right side and the Incubi cards on the left side of cities. These cards have numbers that you're trying to balance. In the player turn he can:
- play a card (on one proper side of one of the four cities in the table - no side can have more than 3 cards on it - respecting the icon on the city, as every city has 2 icons and the card played must have one of them on it);
or
- discard a card (this triggers one of two effects: a) swap cards from the same side of cities - like a Sognae +2 card from city 1, for a Sognae +1 card from city 3 - the swaped cards don't have to respect the icons on the city card; b) establish balance: you can take one or more cities that are balanced. If you take a city, you must replace it for another, placing two cards from the draw deck on it - this placement don't have to respect the icons on the city card).

You now take a card from the draw deck to replenish your hand.

Simple, right?

Every now and then will come Chaos cards, wich you can deal in three ways:
- put it on the stronger side of a city (all Chaos cards are worth +5);
- discard all cards around a [b]balanced[/b] given city;
- discard the next four cards from the draw deck (if there are Chaos cards among these four, you must apply the effect of them one at a time, just like if you had drawn them like usual).

The game goes like this: play/discard a card, buy a card, apply the effect of Chaos cards when one appears, until either you manage to balance all 12 cities (you win), or when the draw pile is empty and you need to draw another card (you lose). A whole play takes around 15-20 minutes to come to an end.

Though both games share the push-your-luck aspect, [thing=94389][/thing] seems to be more on the swingy side of it then [thing=71836][/thing], mainly due to the absence of the Key cards, which in [thing=71836][/thing] you can use them to have some level of control of the draw deck, while also having a way to counter the action of Nightmare cards. But, in [thing=71836][/thing], you basically only have two cards to play at a given time (a card with a different symbol than the last, or a key card, which can also be the card with the different symbol), therefore controlling the deck was way more necessary there. As in [thing=94389][/thing], because of the 4 cities open in the table, is like having 8 slots to put a card, so it is more a decision of "which card to put" than "wich card I will discard that will bit me in the ass less later". So, after a few plays, I have a sense of control that is about the same in both games.

Now the point of problem: the Chaos cards. Though they have this name, are really lawful: they will [u]always[/u] be bad, just like the Nightmares, but without ways to deal with them other than playing them. This isn't thematic - the Chaos would, sometimes, help, even if it didn't want to, but, hey, you know, [i]chaos[/i]. So here as some ways to deal with this situation:

a) Nothing. Just use the Chaos as written and see how well you do in the end;

b) Use them to discard the cards around one [b]unbalanced[/b] city that do not have Chaos cards on it and only if you do not have a place to add the Chaos card in a city that didn't already has a Chaos card. This could give you a fresh start in a city when you cards aren't good to help. But if you have a city without Chaos, it will go there before helping you - even if the sum of both sides are zero (you, then, choose in wich side the Chaos card goes). However, this almost eliminates the option to discard 4 cards in the draw deck, because you will probably avoid doing this, since it will normally be better to actually add the Chaos card (because it might block a later one);

c) If the Chaos cards cannot be add to a city (due to the limit of three cards on all the higher sides), you can discard it without further effect (so, you will never lose a balanced city nor will have to discard 4 cards from the draw deck, unless you prefer one of these over adding the Chaos card to a city, and not because you simply cannot add it even if you wanted to).

For now, I'm applying A, but will probably change to B or C if the plays start to be frustrating (which they aren't for the time being).

[thing=94389][/thing] requires a little more space to play than [thing=71836][/thing], though not a whole lot more. Playing time, as I mentioned before, is around the same. And just like [thing=71836][/thing], [thing=94389][/thing] comes with expansions inside the base (small) box - though I haven't tried them to say much about it.

My grip with the game, isn't really regarding it, but goes to the manual - or, more precisely, the two sheets of rules. I don't mind having two sheets of rules when, like in [thing=71836][/thing], all the rules for the base game are in one, and the rules for the expansions, in the other. Given that the rules for [thing=94389][/thing] have more pictures and examples, they "spilled" to the other sheet. Ok, I can accept (begrudgingly) this, but at least put the rest of the rules in the front of the sheet, as a normal progression! But no, according to the folds of the sheet, the continuation of the rules are in the back of the rules for the expansions! As you can see this isn't a huge (not even normal-sized) thing, just annoying - so my complains regarding [thing=94389][/thing] are close to none. However, as in [thing=71836][/thing], the box won't hold the cards once sleeved! Damn it! I calmed myself when I realized that [thing=94389][/thing] doesn't require as much shuffling as in [thing=71836][/thing], which is constant. In [thing=94389][/thing] you give one initial shuffle and that is it.

To sum things up, I found [thing=94389][/thing] smart, quick and fun solo game, one that I will keep with me for my lunch time plays, and it is set som much apart from [thing=71836][/thing] that you most definitely have both in your collection.

Gorgeous artwork, dreamy. It doesn't have Onirim and Sylvion's richness & layered expansions that build off their simpler baseline skeleton. 

Relies on developing a card counting scheme as it's core puzzle.

A rare and elegant game that is even better than Onirim.  I recommend both titles to the world traveler and hermit alike.

Note: I feel lucky to have the original "Equilibrion" title.

Inferior to Onirim. More mathy, more random, less player control, and the difficulty does not scale as well. Here comes the rant... 

The base game is far more difficult than Onirim's, and not because there are more difficult, more interesting decisions to make. It's harder simply because you're statistically less likely to win. 

In Onirim you have 56 labyrinth cards with which to claim 8 door cards. It takes either 1 or 3 labyrinth cards to claim a door. 

In Urbion you have 72 dream cards (not including the 8 chaos dreams) with which to claim 12 city cards. It takes anywhere from 2 to 6 dream cards to claim a single city card. Additionally, city cards are not automatically claimed but require you to discard an additional dream card to claim them. 

The cards are claimed by balancing positive and negative dreams so that their combined numbers are equal on both sides of the city. Since two dream cards are randomly drawn from the top of the deck and placed beside each city during setup, the difficulty of a given game will wildly vary from play to play, based solely on that random initial draw. You could draw two +4 positive dreams for a given city, or you could draw a -2 negative dream and a +2 positive dream for that city. In the first case the city will require you to play three negative dreams to balance it (-3, -3, -2 ; there are no -4 dreams), and in the second case the city is already balanced. 

Then there are the Chaos dreams, which are this games version of Onirim's nightmares. If you draw a chaos card, you have three equally bad options: putting the chaos card on the strongest side of an unclaimed city card (Meaning you will have to spend at least one, but maybe two or three, more dream cards to claim that city), or discarding all dream cards from an balanced but unclaimed city card (again, this means you'll have to spend at least two more dreams, in the best case scenario, to claim balance this city), or milling the top four cards of the deck. This last option is a huge risk. Unlike in Onirim, where nightmare cards revealed by a nightmare's milling option are simply set aside and shuffled back into the deck, chaos cards revealed by milling are TRIGGERED IMMEDIATELY. If this happens, not only have you wasted three dream cards from the top of your deck, you'll also have to contend with yet another chaos dream, which will make you use several more dreams to claim another city. 

In Onirim, nightmares are balanced out by key cards. Keys can be discarded to negate a nightmare, to claim a door you've just drawn, or to look at the top five cards of your deck, discard one (hopefully a nightmare), and put the rest back in any order. There's an interesting press-your luck element here - do I keep the key in my hand in hopes that I draw a door, or do I discard it to control my topdeck? 

Also, Onirim's reshuffling of the deck provides another clever way to avoid nightmares. If I use a key to look at the top five cards and see two nightmares, a door, and two labyrinth cards, I can discard one nightmare, then arrange the rest of the cards like so: labyrinth card, door, labyrinth card, nightmare. This way, the door is drawn and goes into limbo, then I draw the next labyrinth card. At the end of the turn, the door is reshuffled into the deck, shuffling away the nightmare.

In Urbion, there is no equivalent to the key cards, and thus NO WAY to avoid or negate chaos dreams. If you draw them early, you're screwed. If you draw them late, you're also screwed. There is no way to mitigate this.

Ugh. I'm through ranting about this game. This is just the base game, too. The expansions make it even more difficult, but in the same uninteresting, utterly chance-based way, with no interesting abilities on your side to balance out those poor chances. 

A frustrating disappointment of a game. At least it was only a $15 dollar mistake.

Contrary to "Onirim", this game is better as a solitaire as it is as a two-player cooperative game. I slightly prefer "Onirim", but this is on par with its predecessor: if you like "Onirim" you will like also this.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Light Solitaire game with very easy rules. It's all about balancing numbers to claim certain cards before your deck runs out. Do not expect any brain burn on this one. It's very mechanical and the kind of game you can play while doing other stuff like watching TV. Artwork is dark (looks like something a mental patient would paint), and is supposed to represent good and bad dreams. I do like the art, but it can be a bit distracting. The only thing that really matters is the little icons in the corners. Urbion is less fiddly and without all the annoying shuffling that you have in [thing=71836][/thing]. Might be a bit drier than Onirim, but I prefer Urbion anyway.

1-2 player co-op card game to balance 12 cities for points by applying good and bad dreams. Double sided chaos cards disrupt your best laid plans. Abstract impressionist card art. Expansions add needed depth to strategy.

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Je n'aime pas particulièrement ce jeu, mais je vais y être accro tant que je n'aurais pas réussi à le complété. Je ne suis pas friand du type de graphisme utilisé dans le jeu non plus. Ceci n'en fait pas un mauvais jeu, juste que j'ai plus souvent qu'autrement quelque chose de mieux à sortir sur la table.

I don't like the kind of graphics they in the game, but it doesn't make it a bad game for much. Only that I always have a better one to bring out to the table.

Beatiful art, as always. But unlike Onirim it can turn out to be a frustrating experience.
It feels like the designer forgot to give the player a way to mitigate the luck factor, which is VERY predominant in this game, like he did in Onirim with the "discarding key" mechanic. The result is an often unwinnable solitair, which doesn't work at all with 2 players.

Very fun - some choice each turn but not overwhelming (a la Onirim).  Doesn't feel as thematic as Onirim because of the math, but since this is quick and solitaire, I guess that's okay.

A neat little card game with some of the same sensibilities as its older brother Onirim, the gameplay is clean yet tricky, plays very well solo and with a cooperative partner - in short, great pocket time-killer.

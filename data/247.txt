Kooky theme but very playable family filler. Interesting decisions to be made, usually whether to boost your own collections or play a card to damage an opponent. The ten Rooster Booster cards that decide when the three rounds end add an excellent layer of increasing tension.

RATING: 6
An ok filler game with some elements of push-your-luck, a lot of randomness and some space for kingmaking. Mechanic wise the game have very strong similarities with Union Pacific - players are gathering goods in various colors in attempt to be the 1st or 2nd in a color at the time the scoring cards shows up. Except here this idea is a whole game actually.

I definitely didn't expect much with this game, in fact I only got the game because it was in the "Pick" series and I thought it would be a nice addition to the others we own. This is a really solid game! Basically you get action points to either draw cards or play cards, and you get points for having a majority of one color. However, because there are so many colors in the game it seems like you don't have to go crazy playing 4 or 5 cards in a set. Instead you can just try to keep pace with any opponent who tries to play the same color. Then there's the interesting element of the fox. It's a bit difficult to remember to move it after each turn, but the strategy it adds is really unique. It almost turns the game into a bit of push-your-luck on some turns, because you could burn action points to move the fox early, if you are hoping to draw a card and fear a scoring round might come. I really liked the feel of this game, and for such simple rules it definitely gave you plenty to think about.

It suffers a bit from the "random scoring" problem, where it's possible for multiple scoring rounds to get lumped together (a little like UP).  This can tilt the game in one player's direction, and first player clearly has an advantage throughout the whole game.  This game feels like UP-very-light.

This is a pretty good card game with trademark Moon card draw and 'Wertung' scoring which Ticket to Ride and Airlines/Union Pacific fans will recognise.  It's not too complex but gives you a few things to think about and plays quickly and well. A good filler/closer.

RATING: 6
Decent little game, but a little minimalistic for me. Amusing for it's position as the "baseline" Alan Moon game, containing only the most minimal, identifiably Alan Moon mechanics - most of his other games borrow one concept from here (the wertungs, the scoring, and the drafting).

I like the game, and for your gaming dollar, I recommend it. This is how I rate it:
*about a 6 in itself
*a 7 as a crowd-pleaser (a decent compromise game) in a group of mixed experience gamers (ie, dragged down by those whose paragon is certain party games), that can't agree on a game. 
*an 8 as a game to play in that 2am-4am gamer slot.  We had a lot of fun playing it then on a gamer weekend.

The rules seem to have some omissions, like, when do you turn over the face-down card?  Do you turn it back down afterward, or is that a waste of time? Is memory supposed to be an element? [Later: I think it is a legacy of earlier versions of the game (Freight), here used to differentiate new columns...?] 

I painted a board (see pics) to help me teach the game to newbies, and keep track of the money cards.

We call the money cards the "ching-ching" cards.

Pretty good for a simple card game, and I like the fact you get penalised for stockpiling cards. The fox is a little odd - almost too easy to pass mhim along so in effect he acts like a kitchen timer, waiting to blow up at the wrong moment, but there is some strategy at least in timing when and where to place him. Yet to find the optimum number of players for this, but have a feeling it's more rather than fewer.

RATING: 7.25
For such a simple game this is really more fun than it has a right to be! And I think what elevates it is the anguish as you approach the endgame. No one wants to be caught with the fox in their henhouse, and you are just hoping you can get that extra card to pull ahead of another player on a particular set.

Silly, light fun - this is a great option for families. The "take that" level is very low, as you only have one other player you can target with the fox each turn. I quite enjoyed the game and would happily play it again.

Components: The artwork is a bit drab for each investment type, and could be color-coded better to distinguish them from each other, making for easier score tallying. But the game does come with a nice scorepad that helps simplify the scoring process.

Experience: Quite fun, with a very interesting dynamic between players and the number of dollar signs showing, where at first everyone races to get cards, and dollar signs pop up quickly, but then drafting slows almost to a halt as players decide which investments to contend in.

Gloria Picktoria. Played two-player, and didn't grasp at first that we should be using the same chickens as your opponents, to get those second-place points. The fox moving rules confused us as well - it moves after every turn for free? My opponent moved it on my longest row right before the last scoring card was revealed, but of course I didn't actually believe that the next card would be the scoring card. Played three-player without the fox - lots of luck but fun.

An Alan Moon game that has many of his familiar trademarks. Players use action points to purchase shares from either face up cards (but everyone sees) or the face down deck. Points are also used to declare shares face up in front of you. Scoring cards are shuffled into the deck to trigger three scoring rounds. Players score victory points by having the most or second most shares in each type. After three scoring rounds, highest total wins. Fun.

RATING: 4
A great intro game for strategy games. It seems like the prototype, if somewhat bland, example of what elements a typical strategy game has: scoring majorities, set collection, drafting cards, action points, unexpected scoring rounds, and short rules set. 

It would be a highly recommended as an intro game, if it had an ounce of fun or or a spark of life. Leave it to Alan Moon to re-animate the bleached corpse of Eurogaming. Really, even a German designer couldn't make a game THIS cold... 
 
Part 1 of Moon's now-famous "Undead Soulless Cyborg Games" trilogy [continued with Capital and Andromeda", and far and away the best in the series of lifeless game corpses.

A simple stock-collecting game with a great timing mechanism (the Wertung/Scoring cards - 10 of 'em!) that make this into a nail-biter of a 30 minute game. 

Freight Train does the collection mechanism better - but you need a ping-pong table & a longer time frame to enjoy it... so this is the default "carry it with you" collecting game from Alan Moon.

Played this once.  I liked it, because it used one of my favourite mechanisms from Union Pacific (also by Alan Moon).  The mechanism is you can either collect (add a card to your hand), or play (take a card from your hand and add it to a scoring pile).  The cards in your hand are worth nothing until they are played, and there are randomly-timed scoring rounds.  So you may have spent your actions to collect the biggest set of "Yachts" in your hand, but another player who has played one Yacht card can get all the points because the scoring round happened before you got a chance to play one.  A simple mechanism, and a short game, but enjoyable because of all the agonizing decisions.

Alan Moon is a one trick pony it seems as I play more and more of his games.  There is often just a single interesting mechanic to constitute the entirety of one of his designs which, usually, also happens to be that silly drafting pile claim to fame.  Reibach & Co. is no exception and basically distills the whole drafting thing to its core without much else.  It isn't bad per se, but it's pretty straightfoward and light.  My main complaint is that there is no tie breaking rule since the game is pretty much inclined to do so.  I find it inexcusable really.  Meh.

A stripped-down version of Union Pacific/Airlines Europe. I think it's as good or better than those longer versions.

My rating is based mainly on the Get the Goods version of the game. I finally played the Gloria Picktoria version and was very surprised by the rules for the fox -- there's no equivalent in Get the Goods, and I thought it made the game feel very different, adding an even bigger push-your-luck element. Going by BGG's decisions for so many other games, Get the Goods and Gloria Picktoria should be listed as separate games. I'd have to play both a couple more times to see which version I prefer. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A card game with some subtle tactics.  Best with 3 players.  Good with 4 or 5 players.  This is a hit with non-gamers.  The version I played is Get the Goods.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Filler.  A good one.  Not mindless.  A pinch of tough decisions, high interaction, fierce competition when buidling the best/unique collections and... that is basically it, the game.

Risk management and push-your-luck elements are present (represented by rooster cards which can trigger scoring) - and you have to integrate these elements into your thinking and take them into account when playing.  Otherwise you would complain about the 'uncontrollable randomness' :P

EDIT: I prefer to play it with more than 3 players.  With 3 all players strictly control each other, the scores are very tight and 1 final move or drawing a final rooster might decide about the final positions.

Reibach & Co is the card display mechanism later recycled by Alan Moon in Ticket to Ride as the engine behind a majority stockholding competition. There are a few interesting decisions which are depreciated by the luck of shares showing up at the right time and the random timing of the scorings. One uncontested industry or a single risk doubler probably will decide the game.

The good thing is that it plays faster than 45 minutes but there's no reason for me to play it again. Too many better filler games around doing more in less time. Alan Moon's later games are far more successful and refined.

RATING: 8
For me personally, this is just as satisfying as Union Pacific, and reveals how superfluous some of UP's elements are (the different track types, varying share numbers, etc.)  In fact, I feel that Get the Goods has more tension, as each scoring round looms ever more ominously with each revealed "dollar" card.  I don't know if it's the whimsical, simplistic graphic design, but though the decisions are basically the same as in Union Pacific, players go more quickly.  One of UP's greatest strengths is its ability to accommodate up to 6 players.  However, sometimes the game drags.  Especially when considering playtime/speed, I have to think that I like Get the Goods more.

Timing is essential and there are a lot of tense moments on whether you take some more or cards in your hand, or decide to put them down on the table.

Rating recently downgraded because everyone else playing seemed to be bored with my old favorite.

Simple, fast and incredibly fun. I used the variant that 2X cards cost 2AP to pick and you can't receive one at the begining of the game. Not as complex as Union Pacific, but it make more accessible. If I could get my hand on a copy of Union Pacific I think it would get a lot less table time than this one.

Strong recommendation.  I wanted to see if the game mechanic held up without the "Union Pacific" map and trains, and it certainly does.  Use the BGG play variants (tuning set to # of players, first round action points handicap, paying 2 points for a 2x card) as they add a positive effect.  Also, get some plastic chips as it makes calculating pay outs faster and more visceral.

[Reibach & Co.] One of the better Alan Moon's games. Essentially, this is Union Pacific;the Card Game. Having 10 scoring cards (and score for 4th, 7th and 10th) is far less random than just having 2-3 scoring cards as in UP. Moon does card games better than board games in my opinion (Canal Grande is better than San Marco, for example).

Works well with 3-5 players and gives very different feel depends on the number of players. 5-player is probably the best.(I tried 6-player game once but it was a bit too chaotic.) I love this game even though I don't win.

It's a good little set collecting & majorities game. Very simple rules. The fox figure adds randomness but also quite a bit tension to the game because you really wouldn't like to get more cards when fox is standing on your precious collection. Especially fun it is to see my little brother struggle & suffer with the fox. (and complain about it for 5+ minutes after the game)

Looking for gloria pictoria which I found slightly better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Smooth but rough (?) card game in which cards have got to be drafted to be displayed in chains of one colour each. Ten special cards mark three scoring rounds when they appear (the first round after the fourth card, the second after the seventh, the third after the tenth... slightly reducing the occasionally rather brutal randomness behind these draws). There are jokers and special cards for risk-takers but that's all the artifice there is in the game. Squeaky clean indeed.

The game for two is very prone to draws. From three players on the luck of the draw casts a bigger shadow but each turn becomes more tense as cards fly by and priorities have got to be set (four players might be best to let the game shine). Overall Reibach & Co. is well worth playing, especially considering the two minutes it takes to explain the rules and set it up.

(own Get The Goods copy)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Get The Goods has 10 suits of 9 cards each. You start with a hand of 4 and there is a draw deck with a draft of 3 cards. You have 3 action points to use each turn - it costs 1 to pick up a card to your hand from the draft, 1 to place a card from your hand to the table (so that it will count in scoring) or 2 to draw blind from the deck. We use the official variant that the special cards cost 2 AP’s to pick up as these are tres valuable. The special cards are the joker and the x2 card (ie the caboose) which doubles your points but means you can’t place any more cards on that suit.

Scoring will occur 3 times (after the 4th, 7th and 10th wertungs show up). For each suit, you get 4m if you’re the only one invested, 3m for first or 1m for second. Ties split the money. Lose 1m for every card in your hand at the end. That’s the essence.

On the plus side, the game captures the key mechanic of the longer games (Union Pacific, Freight Train) but manages to finish in 45 minutes. On the down side, it’s just the mechanic. There’s none of the flavour of the longer games, and it’s missing some of the elements / choices that make the others more interesting (ie managing your yards in Freight Train, or managing the variable rewards in UP).

The game plays itself to an extent ... grab a monopoly if you can, concentrate on first places in a few suits, invest in the suits which the player to your left is collecting, and absolutely grab any x2’s that come up.

I might pull it out occasionally for family type affairs.

RATING: 7
Great family card game for 2 to 5 players. This game should be in every household instead of Skip-bo or Uno. 

Rules are fiddly worded. Easy to get scoring turn actions and options wrong from the poor wording. Some players don't like the cartoonish artwork, but I think it is colorful and playful.

Alan Moon sure knows how to make a bad game. So far I've liked none of his games. Well, I'm optimistic and continue the search...

Anyways, this one apparently predates Ticket to Ride and stuff. Well, it shows. You have an option to either pick a card from a row of three cards (1 action point) or pick a random one (2 action points), you have a total of 3 action points.

The base mechanics are tolerably simple: you either pick a card, lay down a card face up or face down or move the fox. You are building collections and to start such thing you have to have a face-down card there. An ok system, yeah.
But then the fox... You can move it on your turn for points or after your turn for free? This is what I understood from the rules. It makes no sense at all. The whole idea of a wooden fox that makes a pile worth zero is kind of artificial.

And finally, that mechanism that makes this game earn its 4: the scoring system. It's a bit like Ra/Razzia: whenever 4th, 7th and 10th Rooster Booster (or whatever) cards are drawn, scoring happens immediately. 
With every color, you count the number of cards and see who has most cards in that colour - even more points if no-one else has that colour. 
Depressing.

And btw, this game doesn't suit for 2 players, NEVER. It's a disgrace to even print it into the box...

I like the mechanics of collecting the biggest set, but the flow of the game is not as smooth as I would like; there is not enough competition and scoring takes too much time comparing to the total game length. I feel that fewer types of goods would shorten the scoring time and would increase competition.

RATING: 6
A pure, cards-only distillation of the majorities-with-periodic-scoring system that Alan Moon uses so often. The theme is preposterous (chickens collecting trinkets) and it seemed like there wasn't much to it at first, but the tension ramps up as the scoring cards accumulate. Added paranoia is provided by the cute little fox figure that passes round like a hot potato, making the collection he sits on worthless.

i really did not like this game. the scoring is too tedious for what is-a simple set collecting game. the rules could have been written a little clearer and the artwork on the cards could have been better. the theme does little to make this game fun. in fact the only fun i had while playing this game was discussing with the other players what other themes this  game could have had. I also found that the timing mechanism, while somewhat clever, is too random and can at times upset the balance of the game.

In the beginning you just pass the fox every turn. But after a while, you feel it's better to wait, untill just before the last rooster turns up. But when is that going to happen? No one knows.

RATING: 6
The game suffers from classic area majority syndrome, in which competition is a losing prospect for anyone involved, and the game devolves into avoiding conflict and playing solitaire.

The redeeming element are the x2 cards -- they double your score from a stock, but prevent you from playing more to that stack.  Thus, they encourage competition, since they create opportunities where competing is not quite so much of a losing prospect for everyone.

All in all, a solid game that was very strong given it's time and now is still ok.  One can see this as a forerunner to Ticket to Ride, which deserves some credit.

A lot of the game play is like any stocks and shares game, but the fox ruins it for me.  Last time one player suggested a house rule that might improve it, which I might try.  Otherwise it'll soon be for trade.

RATING: 6.5
A good little filler that sees Alan Moon distil several core elements from Union Pacific (shares in different stocks and scoring). Each turn, players have 3 actions to take: draw a card, play a card or draw a special card.

In usual Moon style, scoring cards drawn trigger 3 rounds of scoring and makes for a tense game.

There are elements of risk taking and showmanship but ultimately, one needs the variants for the game to 'breathe' a little. As it stands, the game has several flaws: the first player advantage, the lock up of the drawpile with all wilds or x2 cards, scoring differences between 1st and 2nd place.

Will readjust rating once variants have been tried out.

This is a clever stock card game.  Light fun, but meaty enough to be a little more than what you might expect to be a filler game.  Still it feels like there should be something more to the game.  Perhaps this game might be better if there was a board with planes or trains attatched, oh wait.

Really tense game. Just like in Union Pacific, the scoring card anicipation is a great feature. I have the CotCot Collect version with the wooden fox, which I think adds a lot to the game. If you can't get your hands on Union Pacific this is a good alternative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's not a bad lighter game, and certainly once you're approaching the scoring threshold, the decision to move the fox comes into play. Still, it's a pretty basic set collection, rummy-esque game, and I think there are other games out there that do this better, and in a shorter time period.

[u]Get the Goods[/u]
1 play, 3-player:
A simple, fast set-collection game. There are 9 types of cards, 10 of each type; plus 5 doublers and 5 wild cards. Possible actions are: draw from 1 of the 3 face up cards (drawing doubler or wild counts as 2 actions), draw from draw stack (counts as 2 actions), play a card facedown to serve as the base for a set (cards of one type per group), and play a card face up. On your turn, you can take 1 type of action 3 times, or 1 type once and another type twice. There are 10 score cards shuffled into the deck (like in Union Pacific) - scoring occurs immediately when the 4th, 7th, and 10th cards are revealed. During scoring, for each type of card whoever has the most gets 3 pts, 2nd gets 1; if only 1 person has that type, 4pts; if 2 are tied, share points rounding down. Doublers are special - once played, you cannot add to that stack; during scoring, they double your score for that type of card. Highest points after 3 rounds wins!

Simple game, decent with 3 but I think it will be better with 4 or 5.

1 play, 3er. Same basic game, but:
- really cute art work
- different scoring? 
... 4 VP if only you have that color
... 3/1 VP for 1st/2nd place
... doubler doubles card count, not VP?
- added a fox which:
... moves to the first card played to your set
... at the END of your turn, may move it for free (0 actions) to a set belonging to your left-hand neighbor
... DURING your turn, may move fox for 2 actions
... during scoring, completely negates the set where it's located as if it didn't exist
I'm not sure that I like the rule changes so much, especially the fox stuff. Does it really add a lot to the game? True, it is another decision point, but we didn't find it came up very much.

Also, I really don't like the Union Pacific style, nearly totally random scoring (shuffling the 10 cards randomly into the deck).

[U.S. Games 'Get the good' 1997 edition] {Merchant; set collection, drafting, action-points; optimal 4p} {6 original rule, 6.5 x2 variant} GtG is a good tactical card game. It's exciting, interactive and fun. There are enough decisions for general players. There are many footprints of Alan Moon in GtG - drafting, hand management and action point system.

Luck is fairly strong. x2 cards are too strong. Variants should be used to minimize the luck and make GtG more tactical and enjoyable. The nondeterministic scoring time adds excitement, though players may find this too random to plan their actions.

The art work and quality of the cards are ok. I prefer linen cards, though.

Game works well with a set collection being the prime center of the strategy.  For card counters there the keystone for each set is the bane of your life and makes the number of cards in each set not known for each game.  Get the X2 (times two) cards to win.  It is very difficult to win without them.

Reibach & Co.  Some people call this "Union Pacific - The Card Game" but that's a stretch since UP is much more complex and has a different theme.  Use the 2 variants: Expensive special cards & Handicapping.  Recently moved my rating up to a 9 after more playings. The random scoring makes each game a new experience.  Scales well from 2 to 5 players (even 6 works well enough).

RATING: 6.5
Pretty good card game based on majorities and drafting. Ten suits of nine cards each, and scoring occurs semi-randomly three times in the game. You can sort of see it coming, and when a scoring gets close you may have to decide between drafting what you want, and getting things out of your hand so they can score.

I don't like the fox and won't play with it again: Adds a random "hot potato" element as well as the fiddliness of keeping track of it and a feeling of direct take-that play.

I think I actually prefer, to this game, makeshift designs of my own combining a card market with cards with suits and values as in "Piece O' Cake." I'm not sure you're getting your effort's worth in Gloria Picktoria in having separate "in hand" vs. "in play" concepts.

I noticed, maybe for the first time, that majorities-based scoring can have some flaws of map-based conflict games, such as when two players find themselves fighting each other for a given "territory," they both lose out relative to everyone else.

...Feeling like there aren't really interesting decisions here. My interest in majority games has dropped in general, but here there's nothing to make decisions tricky. The card flips randomly limit what card colors you can develop, but it never feels like you might want to play something sub-optimal because there's a worthwhile trade-off of some kind.

The thinking man's Lost Cities, with a 3-stage, timed scoring system and zarjazz point-deducting 'hot potato' character (cute orange wood fox meeple) that jumps between players each turn.

RATING: 5
Gloria Picktoris is a retheming of Get the Goods with a couple of new rules.  The fox is an interesting addition.  Unfortunately, you can only use it to affect the player on your left, which automatically means that it's better to invest in the same color/suit as that person as well as the one across from you.  As a result, the game becomes fairly predictable and one-dimensional, no real strategy or decision involved.  Still bland and mediocre.

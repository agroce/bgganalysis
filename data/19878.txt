RATING: 5
1 play. Run of the mill set collecting card game

RATING: 6
A mildly-interesting games.  The primary decision-making concerns which of the face up sets of cards you choose.  The secondary decision-making concerns when to have parties (i.e., score a completed building).  While there's a  benefit to non-competition (better selection of that color), there's also a balancing penalty (lower scoring for parties).

I didn't get a solid feel for tactics or strategy.  It's pretty random since the card draw is your life blood.  There's another nice balance in that completing buildings will reduce a player's shields, thus pushing him/her to the back of the line.

Overall, an interesting game that I would gladly play again.  Not particularly deep, but it plays out very quickly.  Pretty decent medium-length filler (probably 20-40 min.).

Wow. A confusing game, not helped by general confusion on the part of the rules explainer. (There's a difference between towers and palaces and it's important, but the words were often switched around in the explanations.) I'd be willing to give it another shot but it seemed awfully random and weird.

RATING: 6
I have mixed feelings about card games that try to be board games.  Some pull it off well; others leave you wondering if they chose cards because of cost measures.  This title leans towards the former.  The idea of constructing your buildings to maximum visual effect is easy to grasp.  The tight time factor makes the game really move along and when its all over - you can see definite progress visually in front of you.  The thing that makes this game work is the speed.  Games are under 20 minutes generally and faster with experience.  This makes it a nice filler between bigger games without fear of being tied up in something when the big games hit the table.

It compares to Coloretto because you end up taking three cards, at least in the five player game I played, put face up on the playing surface and the decision involved here is similar to Coloretto where you have to decide what set to take that helps you verses hurts someone else.   But to me this still feels like a very different game than Coloretto and I think there are more things to think about. I at least enjoyed my first playing.

After getting all the rules right to this tight little card game, I enjoy it much more.  It plays in a short time and with a variable number of players from 3 to 5.  There are plenty of decisions to make:  trade offs between short term and long term gains, points or strength, your gains or to minimize the gains of your opponents.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys card games that play more like board games.

There is a game here, but I dont think I like it. It is mathy and fiddly and rules-laden and it's just not super. Its basic set collection and the theme is a noble attempt to jazz it up. I would never suggest it and I would try to divert attention from it to something else.. but I would play it if I had to. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game has no real choices to make beyond obvious ones.  Should I try to take initiative (at the cost of scoring) or score (at the cost of initiative.  Shall I take the set worth 8 points to myself, leaving the one worth 7 for my opponent, or the one worth 6 to me leaving the one worth 4 for my opponent. All of the choices are obvious.That being said, i think that this would be a good game to play with non-gaming family members at thanksgiving, as it offers the illusion of choice and control (kind of like carcassone, or dominoes). And the set collection and construction of buildings is kind if fun.

Seems like pretty decent filler material, but nothing incredibly innovative.  The main problem we saw is that someone that starts with a hand weak in shields is going to have a rough time getting ahead in turn order, and will probably be at a disadvantage for quite a while.  Nevertheless, the game is alright and I'd certainly play if it was suggested.

This game would almost be better as a pure abstract because the poorly-conceived theme seems to make the game harder to understand.  Not that the rules make any sense to begin with.

RATING: 7
A pretty good light card drafting and building game.  Cards represent levels of buildings and players draft sets of them in order to create their own buildings.  Scoring is based on the number of windows that your building levels have.

For those who know the Knizia game Palazzo, this may all sound familiar.  The game have similarities, but it turns out this is coincidental - this game was  being demoed long before Palazzo was released.  Sometimes this just happens in the game biz.

This rating is based on one playing of a prototype.

Simple card game based on building palaces to score points (based on the number of windows on the palace cards). The game is quick <15 minutes and is very good for the time period, if it were longer--wouldn't be much fun. Actual game has some complexities around scoring (throw parties, city wall, and a few other scoring wrinkles)

I'll admit, I didn't quite "get" this game at first. It seemed straightforward, but I was mistaken on several points. However, after finishing and understanding my mistakes, I don't think a proper understanding would have changed my enjoyment of the game. Build buildings (cards), cash in those buildings for maximum value (based on other players' cards), and hope for a good selection in the next market. Nothing really there to spark my interest.

Short filler.  There are some tactical options, but it's too short and random to really plan ahead.  Not bad for filler, but the fact that you make the decisions about the turn order next turn before you even see what you're going to be able to get is a little weird.  With more play the strategies become more clear.

Fast, elegant little game that is underrated. The box will not attract you, and you'll miss all that's packed in here. Consider it the small box version of a board game.

I appreciate the tension of shield vs windows, and really like the high/low number scoring at the end, but I'm still not sure if I'm a fan of the game. There is strategy in there, but it seems as though the endgame arrives too fast for a said strategy to be fully deployed. Also the final scoring with the wall/tower is very confusing and a pain to explain.

A short yet thoughtful card game wherein players try to build castles of similarly-colored cards.  Players get points both for the number of windows in the castles they build and for the number of walls they've built (which players need to support with unbuilt castles that have shields on them).  Players must thus balance building castles with saving shields and building walls.  This seems like a classic item-balancing game, and is quite fun, especially considering that it's short (it only lasts five to seven rounds; less than half an hour).

The major problem with this game is that it's very difficult to explain to new players - our group had a heckuva time figuring out what was going on until we actually started playing.  I've made a little player guide, and we've found it to be extremely helpful while explaining the game (and especially the scoring) to new players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game store "impulse purchase", but I do not regret it. The artwork is sparse, showing "architect's drawings" of buildings which you must collect in sets by color and then score. Scoring is based not only on the contents of the set, but on how far along other players are in collecting that color set. A four-player game ran about an hour, including learning the rules.

I have to give my Wargame Secret Santa (who gave me this game as a stocking stuffer) extra thanks for this game is a GREAT filler.  After some initial confusion about scoring, the game plays smoothly, is not prone to AP and is just plain enjoyable.  I prefer it with 3 or 4 rather than the full 5 (in fact, playing with five players is why the rating is so low), because 5 players just seem more chaotic and tends to bog the game down a bit.

I think too many people under-rate this game because it's just cards, instead of a whole board with nifty stacking palaces and wooden turn markers and a victory point track and stuff.

Don't let your first impression fool you: this is a [i]great[/i] game. After 3 readings of the rules, I was convinced there wasn't a game here, but after 2 plays, it's quickly become one of our favorite filler games. It plays incredibly quickly (5-7 rounds in 15-20 minutes) and there's enough decision-making that you feel you're not at the mercy of the cards, but also not enough to drag the game out.

To me, for a game to be worthwhile the design must require at least one meaningful decisions every couple turns.  Lucca Citta requires you to flip your "strategy" between going for points, or going for initiative to get points.  Ok, perhaps that is good enough in another system, but here it seems that no matter how you play it all your choices are obvious.  The design doesn't give enough wiggle room, so as you play your options limit themselves: you can only hold three in a structure, you can't dupe colors.  This means that of every option available to chose from, there will almost always be a clear optimal move.Perhaps, once in the game you have to make a difficult choice, otherwise the gameplay feels wrote from the beginning to the merciful end.  After a couple plays I feel that I've seen all I'm going to see in the game.

Have only played it once so far, but I really like it.  Enough strategy to take your success into your own hands, but still depends on luck of the draw.  Look forward to playing this one more.

Played a few times when it was first released in English.  Quite enjoyed it, though it wasn't something I'd really request to play.  Good enough game.

"Palazzo the Card Game"?  Similar to Clocktowers?

RATING: 5
Intersting card game.  It seems vaguely Rummy-esque somehow, but that may just be a lack of familiarity with both games on my part.  Yet another game in a long series where you pretty much have to write off your first game as a learning experience.

Rating: tentative 6.  Wow it's short!  There's lots going on and it seems like you just don't quite have enough turns to do what you want.  I think the game teases you with choices but doesn't deliver strategic depth. 
I think you really need to realize that this is a super short tactical filler and not a deep strategy game if you're going to enjoy it.  Rating probably would go up with further playings. 2006/04/06

I think we were playing this a bit wrong, but just seemed like far too much pencil and paper work for what should have been a quick filler.

Surprisingly complicated card game.  Quick but seemingly quite deep.  Not bad at all.

Plenty of hidden strategy in Lucca Citta.  The only knock is that it seems to end too quickly sometimes.  Scoring can be very tight!

Fast and nice card game once you fully understand all the dimensions of the shield symbols, palace windows, city walls and street numbers. Confusing to grasp at first, but well worth the effort. Don't give up on this one. Good game.

I found it brilliant and clever. Artwork is original and very elegant. I think it needs more than two or three plays to appreciate it at his best.

Initial rating.  After one play in which I butchered up the rules, this seems like a decent and quick filler.  I'm curious enough to hopefully get a few more plays in before updating my rating.

I found this card game on sale and have yet to play it with the suggested 3-5 players.  I really want to find someone else to play this with as my wife and I really enjoy it with our own 2-player variant.  I can see how this tiny game could shine as a great filler with more players.

Lucca Città is more like a German-style board game that happens to be made entirely out of cards than it is a "card game" per se. Under "Categories" it should have "City building" and possibly "Renaissance". Under "Mechanics" it should have "Set Collection" even though that doesn't quite fit, and hmm... oddly enough, none of the other categories or mechanics listed adequately describe this game. "Variable turn order" isn't in the list, "competitive selection" isn't in the list, "strategic action timing" isn't in the list, and "pattern building" only vaguely describes the way this game works. "Tile placement" is used for something completely different in other games, so that isn't right... maybe "card placement" (which also isn't in the list) would describe it best.

I like the way this one plays out, with the different aspects of the cards contributing to scores in different ways.  It also plays quickly, which is a plus for me.  I don't like the 3-point swing that takes place at the end of the game, but it's easily left out to improve the game.  The game is strange with 3 players, and I wonder if it properly works with that number.

Extremely fast-playing filler. It takes more time explaining the rules than playing one game. Not great, but definitely fun, and with some good (if not overly original) mechanics.

Played once (with 4 players). The rules are a bit overwhelming at first (they could probably be rephrased in a simpler way), but the game is easy to play once you get it. There are some decisions, but nothing really difficult, and the game is much shorter than it looks like. Overall it was enjoyable, even if not great.

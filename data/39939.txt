RATING: 10
[2012] Visually, it's certainly one of the best games in my collection! Now all that remains to do is to play it!
[2013] Well, after having played it, I think it deserves a '10' also from a gaming point of view. Complex, but very well thought mechanics render perfectly the XVIII century warfare. And the game is really enjoyable!

RATING: 8.5
Stunning map and counters. Includes introductory scenario but probably the most complex game rules I've tried (and that includes ASL)!

Make sure you get hold of the Primer - this is a much clearer explanation of the rules also the examples and training modules all use Fontenoy.

Played this as my introduction to BAR and was thoroughly impressed. Used the Primer to help me absorb the rules, and I would recommend that to anyone approaching the series for the first time.

My rating is both for the series and this battle. I have played through scenario 5 and Melle solo, and had a great time. The initiative system lends itself to solo play, and the various procedures within the game provide a fantastic narrative, and die rolls, and special results in particular, give great replay value.

I can see multiple strategies for both sides (more so the Allies who are presumed to be the attackers), and so I will return to this title and play the main battle again.

The bug has certainly bitten with this one, as I am now tracking down the rest of the series...

I like what is being done to the BAR series in the new games and in updating the old, and it has drawn my attention to these games. The complexity level is a bit too high for me so far but especially Fontenoy is such a treat visually that it weighs up for it almost entirely, plus the ununusal topic. One day I will take part in a campaign game of this.

Another beautiful volume in COA's Battles from the Age of Reason series and the only one involving the Brits in Europe.

The  French are in good dug-in positions, which compensates for their poor troop quality. The English are supported by unreliable Dutch and Austrian allies and if using the historical scenario, are forced to attack into the narrow corridor between the French field works and the woods to the East with the "Infernal Column" which, if successful, will expose it to counterattacks from the numerous French cavalry reserves.

The game really comes to life if the English and their allies use the alternative flanking manouevre scenario which really opens up the game  allows the allies to avoid the French field works and roll up the French left flank by marching beyond the woods.

If you are a BAR veteran this will be a fairly easy game to master, if not, then try to get hold of the excellent BAR Primer which is written to accompany this game but covers the whole series.

3 plays as Allied, starting one as French

Too much unbalanced in French favor!! Try you to attack without the "Infernal Column" and watch what happen to your units ... melt like snow! ;)
The bloody "IC" seems the ONLY Allied solution for this battle ... just a little boring.
Duch troops are pretty useless ... or worse, they are dangerous because they are the  weak side of the Allied Army, in case the French goes to attack.

Excellent: Age of Reason - Tactical - Difficult

My plunge into BAR and this is the ultimate tactical battle simulation. 

-Summary of the rules are a BIG help and can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/battlesfromtheageofreason/home/bar Still around 25 pages long but easy to navigate so you find what you are looking for quickly.
-BAR Primer available, a BIG help in learning the system: http://www.clashofarms.com/BAR_Primer.html
-Strategically and tactically Fontenoy has a lot to offer; the French expected the Allies and how do you approach the French line; through the center with the Dutch and English attacking Fontenoy simultaneously to dislodge the complete French right? If the Dutch fail, Allies are screwed. Or better to outflank the French by going through the woods taking the battle to the French left while keeping the threat on the right? A massive attack on Antoin and going through the center? All are serious options.
Tactically the system offers a lot of different options as there are numerous types of units / unit formations.
-Components are excellent; incredible attention to detail they put into the game and the research. Box cover makes many games in my collection look pale.
-The maps, counters, orders of battle and player aids laid out make for an incredible sight like if you were there; leading an army on the battlefield never came closer!! 
-A game where so much effort went into the looks and reasearch deserves a serious game system and that is exactly what BAR is. A great symbioses. 
-The relatively small box is packed with loads of stuff: three gorgeous maps, excellent player aids, three beautiful counter sheets, 3rd editions rules, scenario booklet etc. etc.
-Numerous scenario's, serious alternatives for both parties as well as optional rule (e.g. massive column for english to try and shift the balance. A historical option that trades leader benefits leading from the front for army paralysis elswhere. wow!) 
-The BAR system is hard work to get it right with all the layers but there is so much to explore. A game that challenges the player who dares to take the step; it is very involved once you get the hang of it.
-Bonus game Melle provides a great warm up for the real deal. Lovely map, interesting tactical situation.

Minus
-Mind you, this is more of a simulation than a game. A LOT is involved when playing this and it can become real challenging as there are rules for everyting. The solution to negate the effects for those who fear it is too cumbersome: get the BAR Primer and print the rule summary, still extensive but divided into clear sections so easy to navigate. Ensure you print a copy before playing.
-Sturdiness of the box could be better, it is quite vulnarable.
-Quite a steep price here in Europe (I paid 75 Euro)

As a kid I must have read 'Great Milititary Battles' by Cyril Falls over a 1000 times and always was intrigued by Fontenoy. Now they finally made a simulation of this battle and it is like a child's dream become true.

I rate this based on first plays of Melle scenario's. I have yet to play the campaign but I will first try the other Fontenoy scenario's as there is a lot to explore as far as strategy and tactics are concerned. 
So far a journey to master the tactics correctly. This game deserves a serious review and I hope I will be able to put one up Discussing the system in depth.    

Finally been able to enter the actual battle. Wow, this baby is big and so many individual commands but The rules provide for the option of playing without them for faster play.

Played the main campaign game and really enjoyed the system.

Takeaway is that the allies need to maneuver if they are going to have a reasonable chance of success.

Going at the field works is going to give you historical results which is a French victory.

Reading the Standard Rules.
If there is a "Game Turn" counter and an "End Turn" counter, why the rules say "Hour Marker" and "Minute Marker"? :)

Cutting to the chase: Great came, so-so simulation of period combat.

Fontenoy packages one large battle and a selection of smaller scenarios for the Battles of the Age of Reason series.  The BAR rules are detailed and precise, so they aren't as complex as their page count would suggest. BAR is perhaps marginally more complex than GMT's Great Battles of History series which it closely resembles despite the vast difference in era.  Also as with GBiH, the learning curve is much gentler if you are familiar with the history and tactics of the era.  If you're not, the game materials do lend themselves to doing small scale tactical problems as pre-game training.  There is the occasional ambiguity in the rules and missing elements in the player aid cards, e.g. one form of column mentioned extensively in the rules.  The rule ambiguity is often associated with the apparently non-standard used of the word "or" to mean "and, if desired,".  Most wargame rules use "or" to mean "either or", what a mathematician would call XOR.  BAR seems to use it to mean the mathematical OR and an English major "and or".  I know the system is all about the Age of Reason, but still, using English instead of Math word meanings would probably have been best.

The player tables are comprehensive and clear, but not well sequenced, so you have to flip pages a lot, even for a single action.

Note: I revised the fire table discussion below after reading more on the psychology of individual shirkers in 18th century battles.

My first concern about the BAR system is the unlimited opportunity fire.  Being a good 18th century gunner, i.e. first and foremost a mathematician, I started crunching numbers for those one and two strength point (i.e. 2 and 4 cannon) 4 pounder units in Melle.  They just don't make sense against the casualty rates given in Muir and other 19th analyses of 19th century combat.  Assuming you have one infantry unit in line closing in, you opportunity fire at a range of 3, and 2 hexes.  With one strength point this gets you, on average, 10 casualties (i.e. a 1 in 10 chance of one strength point loss).  Working from the data available in Muir for the more effective Napoleonic artillery, experts of the era would have expected about one casualty per minute per gun for a total of 40 killed in our approaching infantry unit (2 guns, 20 minutes).  But, as Muir points out, the experts were optimistic and actual shots fired far exceeded casualties inflicted.  Maybe 1 shot in 4 caused a casualty.  Taking that into account, so far our pair of BAR 4 pounders are right on the money.  Now let them fire at a line of one-hex infantry units.  They shoot at 4 units at 3 hexes and 3 at 2.  They only really do any real damage at 2 hexes (at 3 hexes at best you scare the target with these cannon), so they cause 30 casualties - about what the experts of the era would hope for but rather high for what they actually achieved.  If you allow for the folks who helped the wounded to the rear these numbers may well work out.  There are no hard numbers on that value, but it could well be about the right size to account for the difference.

Now, let's try a 2 strength point 4 pounder unit from Melle and that highly nonlinear fire table in BAR where doubling the number of shooters far more than doubles the number of casualties.  Now our approaching wall of infantry suffers (on average) 300 casualties - from 4 guns that could shoot at most 2 shots a minute and only 1 at sustained fire - call it 80 shots per turn most turns.  The question is how going from 2 to 4 guns could change the expected casualties from 30 to 300.  We now have 80 shots causing 300 casualties, way more than one would have expected from the historical record.  True, the number of shirkers helping wounded to the rear probably went up non-linearly with the rate of incoming fire, but I doubt the ratio was ever this high.  There are no hard numbers in the literature on shirkers though, so who knows.

My feeling on opportunity fire is that cannon should be limited to perhaps 4 opportunity fire attacks per turn.  I also feel that the increase in casualties with increased firepower is overdone for 18th century battles of attrition, but it's hard to say by how much.   So I end up having some doubts about BAR as laboratory for experimenting with period tactics.  Great game, certainly!  Accurate simulation, not so clear.  A reasonable guess given our sketchy understanding of 18th century psych casualty rates, probably.

In the end I couldn't resist the graphical beauty and the chance to get into the 3rd edition of the BAR rules, notwithstanding my comments in relation to Leuthen.

Rules are well written and clear.  My first VASSAL game (as the Allies) taught me a lot about 18th century tactics.  Very clean set of rules given the complexity.

RATING: N/A
A departure from the Seven Years’ War for the BAR series, this one covers the French victory under Maurice de Saxe over the English/Hanoverians/Dutch/Austrians under the Duke of Cumberland (the so-called Pragmatic Allies) in the War of Austrian Succession. This is a large battle, with many counters in play, although there are scenarios included that cover smaller pieces of it. The game also includes the Battle of Melle, a much smaller battle that occurred shortly after Fontenoy, with a further simplified version intended as a BAR beginners' scenario. Melle itself is a fun, chaotic situation. The game includes the new 3rd Edition BAR rules – as of April 2013, the only way to currently obtain them. The upcoming BAR Primer will also include a tutorial section that relies on the Melle map and counters. Finally, Fontenoy has some wonderful notes on the battle and perhaps the most beautiful components in the BAR series, which is already well known for its great art, scholarship and high production values. 

Anyone with any interest in modelling 18th Century battles at the level of detail provided by the BAR series should seriously consider this one – it’s a good entry point.

I playtested the main battle scenario at Consimworld Expo '08 as the Allied player against two French players, and we had an enjoyable game.  I playtested the current version with the latest BAR rules.  Gamers who enjoy BAR are going to find a lot of things to like in Fontenoy - a variety of scenarios, interesting terrain and fortifications, and Dutch, English, Hanoverian, and French troops.

A detailed game system that (fortunately) has a number of games that can run on the same rules set. While the rules look bulky, they are well put together and well explained and are thus easy to read.

The game is very well supported by the designer who is very visible on line and is renowned for rapid responses to queries. He has also been foremost in encouraging the game to be played by hosting massive multiplayer online games when the game was released.

The system is similar in nature to the la Bataille system in terms of mechanics but the system itself tailors the mechanics to the BAR period nicely. It takes a handful of scenarios to start getting the feel for how everything works, but it is worth the time investment as the system is reqarding. There is the added strength that all games in the series (currently 8) are ably supported.

Fontenoy, also has a multitude of small, medium and large scenarios - 9 in all. The game also contains amongst the best graphics for map and counters that you will find (assuming you like the style).

BAR is the wargame system I have been looking for my whole life. Beautiful, both visually and intellectually, detailed, involved and incredibly evocative of warfare in the period. The Battle of Fontenoy is gorgeously presented with a host of scenarios both large and small. A treat for the true grognard.

RATING: 10
My first game in the BAR system, the "early start" full battle scenario 4-player game.  I command the French left half.

Yes, the rule learning curve is steep but rewards those who listen to the Primer's advice to follow period tactics.  Don't think you can roll up to the battle in road column and shake out your line as you fire at the enemy.  Sorry, the formations matter, the cavalry has teeth, and woe unto those who don't get their infantry into supported line before the enemy is in range. The Boyd Cycle of action and reaction takes time and forethought in linear warfare.

If you care about replicating BAR battles, this series supplemented by the Primer and the rules summary, is great.  I wanted to play the AWI games but now own all the BAR series except Kolin, and I'm looking for that final game.

update:  I bought Kolin and finished Fontenoy's scenario 5 (early start full-battle).  Superb game with many tactical options and problems to play out.  We all wanted to switch sides and restart!  After more experience my rating remains a 10.

What a beautiful wargame. The counters. The map. It's gorgeous. It is an effort to wrap one's head around the rules, but once done it provides a majestic, exalted, and noble wargaming experience. It is the perfect gateway into the BAR system of rules.

Mi entrada a Battles from the Age of Reason series. Sacará al pequeño gran Napoleón que llevas dentro y le dará el sistema definitivo para saciarlo. Batallas épicas y memorables. Cada choque deja huella en tu memoria y nunca se olvida.

Su dificultad de aprendizaje es el precio a pagar por tenerlo todo en un sistema táctico increíble. Vale la pena trabajarse su enorme manual.

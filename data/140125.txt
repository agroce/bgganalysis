An okay game. I put too much money into it. The choose your own adventure nature of the game is great, and if that was it I would love it. Unfortunately the fact that character and monster stats often have no thematic link to the outcome, and that most of the time the roll doesn't either just ruins it for me. Too bad too, because this was a great idea.

Sadly this turned out not to be what we thought. When we saw this previews on the Dice Tower for its Kickstarter campaign we loved the way it all sounded. One on one dungeon crawl battle. But when we got it we realized it is a campaign game that carries over from one game to the next. Not dissimilar to the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Which we were already hip deep in at the time. I swear I don't recall the campaign nature of this game being mentioned in the preview. Or maybe I just wasn't paying attention. But since we already had Pathfinder we just could not justify putting the time into another game in that vein. So off to the trade pile it goes.

It promised so much but in the end the game has some really startling balance issues.  It also has some interaction issues as a two player game.  The biggest issue would be all the exclusive content that is out there unavailable to the general public.  You really are buying half a game at the retail level.

WOW!!!!!! 2 player greatness! Fallen emulates a full on dungeon crawl experience with decks of cards, a few dice and some great storytelling. Think of this as sort of a 2 player only ultra competitive Tales of the Arabian nights. We have had so much fun playing this. Amazing components, easy to understand rules with tough decisions. Fantastic game!

Two player only and a bit on the long side. One player controls the hero, the other the dungeon lord. I love the story cards, as it makes it very much like an RPG with branching events.

This is a wonderful adaptation of a Dungeon crawl into a 2 player game. It is complex, and there are a good number of moving parts, but it really does do a great job of creating a flexible but easily manageable Dungeon explore experience.

The Heroes have 3 types of cards. Skill cards which you use experience to purchase to upgrade yourself so you can gain special ability and roll more dice; Equipment cards which you have to win struggle to acquire them in certain story choices and Power Card which you also acquire from story encounter. You have a maximum hand size which are often 3 and you can play the Power Card whenever it is legitimate to play. This will be stated in the card. The Dungeon Lord on the other hand has Creature Cards and Omen Cards. Creature are the backbone of the Dungeon Lord as it give him special abilities and more dice to roll. You can better creatures by upgrading them using XP point. However, it will only be fun if you can incorporate your creatures in your narration and not simply a utility card. Omen cards are event cards which surprise and screw the Hero.

Best thing is to watch the video to see and understand the gameplay. It plays more like Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone fighting fantasy story book or Lone Wolf story book series. At the beginning, the Dungeon Lord will be story teller and choose a story cards where he will narrate the scenario and inform the Hero the choice he can take. For each choice, the Hero will have to encounter a struggle, it can be Strength, Intelligence, or Agility. After the Hero goes through FOUR encounter, then we move to the conclusion of the story and the process is repeated another times before moving on the FINAL BATTLE. In the FINAL BATTLE, the story telling role will be reverse. The Hero will draw a final battle card and announce the condition of the battle.

Provisional rating, need to play it more :)

I like the story cards, feels like a choose your path adventure (for the hero), but there's a bit of possible disconnect between them - playing an adventure pack helps.

Disconnect continues with monsters - which are a bit generic and take the place of traps etc, so the story says one thing and then you face the monster, which might be a different type (story says goblin, you face a snake ...) or even totally unrelated - story says decipher the runes, you are attacked by a dragon :(

Rules try to justify this away with the monster is in the background distracting you ... which sort of works, but how then can I wound it? Definitely needs a bit of stretching with creativity to keep the narrative flowing, which is a real shame.
 
Overall, like it a lot, and by far my best kickstarter. But I feel it needed a bit more development, which of course might come with expansions.

Stuff I'd like to see:

Monsters by type, so you collect a specific group for each Dungeon Lord (the Ogre King has goblins, orcs, ogres and a few oddities, the Archivist has cultists etc).

Stuff other than monsters - traps, puzzles, etc so the DungeonLord has more available, but is limited to where they can be used.

More connect with treasures and hero - seems a bit odd my magic user gets an axe (and can use it).

More starting scenarios, currently each Dungeon Lord has one on the reverse of their mat, with 2 possible outcomes, it isn't going to take long to learn them :( I suspect we'll end up rolling a die to determine start rather than use these.

Playmats have arrived, OMG they're amazing! :)

** Update, now played 10 times, and increasing my rating to 10, this is a great game (currently my top game of the year)

*** Update, now playing this all the time - at least once a week. It's utterly brilliant, and the announced expansion plugs the only reservation I had (initial quests at the start soon get learnt).

RATING: 3
This game might be ok as a story telling game, although the story is rather disjointed and while you choose the options, your character may not do what you were expecting him to do so that takes me out of the immersion.  And while the game is nothing but a series of dice rolls and some mild card play, that in of itself isn't bad, what got me is that you are severely limited by what you have and completely dependent on the roll of the dice.  In the game I played I felt I didn't over commit during the adventure and yet I won nearly every encounter, got the best reward ever time, and yet come to the final encounter the enemy has better powers, rolls better dice, and absolutely destroyed me in three encounters even when I threw everything at them.  Maybe I just didn't get into the story enough but I hate a game where what happens before the final battle has no meaning, and then the reward for the final battle is nothing but a pat on the back, even though this is touted as a campaign style game.  Hard pass for me.

RATING: 9
Fun fantasy themed dice-chucking game.  Excellent art.  No strategy, just a few tactical decisions here and there.  The game is mostly luck.  Regardless, I enjoy playing it.  Screams for linked story cards that actually tell a story.

Game is incredible.  It's Descent, if you make it two player and completely gut out the tactical combat, instead inserting a Lone Wolf style choose your own adventure framed up around a skill contest dice rolling system.  Magnificent and one of the best releases of 2014.

Light resource management mixed with story cards have you largely just rolling dice against each other trying to roll more swords. For people who really get into the story aspect -- which is pretty disconnected and requires active imagination -- I could see this working better. For us, largely just generic-feeling fantasy, and without any real richness in gameplay.

My favorite 2-player dice game, hands down.  You would have to rip this puppy out of my cold, dying hands.  I wish this one had seen a better release as I think it would be super popular.  If you like paragraph games or choose-your-own-adventure, this one is great.  One player is a hero and the other is the dungeon lord.  There are roll-offs against different stats for the hero to accomplish and many monsters for the demonlord to utilize.  I'm lucky to have grabbed all of the content available for this game.

Hard game to rate. Parts of it were brilliant, make your own adventure meets boardgame and fall in love. Parts seems unbalanced. in the end fight I as the good adventurer lost 3-0, without having even a theoretical chance of matching the evil players rolls which felt quite weird. Perhaps I was just unlucky, but still not  a good ending.

Dice are nicely weighted, great etching/graphics. The colors are a bit bland; blue, red, black white. (chessex has amazing dice have them make cool dice for you watchtower)
*dice: 8 of 10

Playing cards are thick & sturdy, graphics are amazing every board game graphics person should ask this guy how to make pictures before buying pens and brushes and what not. The text is big, the font is nice, and there is amazing flavor text on most if not all cards. 
*playing cards: 10 of 10

Story cards have a nice flow going from one part to the next. It is easy to understand the icons, which prompt the players on strategies, cards, or dice to use. These icons are consistent, thematic, and what I think keep the games pace running smooth from start to finish. It all meshes together, no fiddlyness to it. The story cards are the soul to the game, and they do not disappoint. vasts amount of scenarios from one story card to the next. These story cards are why you do not need a board for this game. The story cards create the game in your imagination just like an RPG or a CYOA. The power cards you play add more immersion if you decide to role play those in by molding the cards name and effect into the current story arc (this is very easily done).
*story cards: 10 of 10

The box insert is ok, but not really suitable once cards are sleeved or if you want to add a tabbing system. With all the Kickstarter rewards I have already outgrown the insert, and I will have to make a foam board solution.
Pathfinder: The Card Game used a fairly good insert that this game could of benefited using a similar design (Providing sleeved cards were considered when making the card slot width).
*box insert: 6 of 10

The box is awesome nice standard size box which is good and sturdy with very cool artwork.

I was unprepared for how much I liked this one, to be honest. I was expecting a weird pseudo-Choose Your Own Adventure type deal, but instead it was a tight dice game with RPG trappings and shockingly decent writing. A shame about all the Kickstarter exclusives and it being two-player only, though.

I own dozens of games and this is my favourite of all time. It probably isn't the "best", it lacks combos and is biased towards the hero, but I love it every single time I play as does everyone in my group.

Very interesting 2 player dungeon game. The theme is absolutely immaculate. So far most games take 1.5-2 hours to play, but because the game makes both players interact constantly it feels like the game plays in 45 minutes, because you don't feel like your waiting for another players turn to end. Also, no matter if your the dungeon boss or the hero the game is equally challenging and rewarding.

The artwork is VERY good. And the components are of a good quality. I have played many different card games and this one has at least equally good quality of printing, but the art definitely rates in the top 3. Also the dice are very rewarding. Normal rolls are 6-8 dice, but when you get to cascade 12+ dice against an opponent (mainly to spite them more then anything else), it feels so rewarding - especially on a big challenge.

My only negative is its not multiplayer!!! Make a 3 heros on 1 dungeon lord standalone/expansion and this would most likely be the greatest game I have ever played.

Glad I backed you as a kickstarter and keep up the good work!

Easily one of the best 2 player games I've played with excellent interaction between the two, constant play from both and the rpg traits are solid.  The stories seem to be very well written and the artwork is fantastic.  

The box manufacturing is high quality, but I would have liked a bit more room for the cards and expansions, plus some way to separate them better.  I'll probably make my own custom inserts for everything.  

The playtime when teaching a new person seems to be well over 120 minutes, but I think 2 players that are experienced can get through a setup-game-breakdown in under that.

RATING: 8
Fallen is a two-player dungeon adventure game where one player is the hero and the other is the dungeon lord. The choice of dungeon lord frames the game with a set introduction and a matching series of final battle cards, but the dungeon adventure in between is entirely changeable. Neither the hero nor the dungeon lord can perish before the final battle, so the purpose of the adventure is to strengthen yourself and prepare for that final showdown where the winner of the game is decided. What makes the game unique is the use of "story cards" to guide the players through the dungeon. After the introductory challenge, the dungeon lord draws a random story card and narrates it for the hero who makes the story choices. Every story card has a decision tree which leads to 4 separate challenges. At each level of the tree, there are 2-3 possible challenges based on the hero's previous decisions. The outcome of those decisions at the end of the story card grants a variable amount of experience points for the hero, which can be spent to gain additional skills. The dungeon lord can also use gained experience to upgrade his creatures. After the hero has traversed 3 story cards, hopefully gaining skills and items along the way, the final battle begins.

I think all of what I describe above is a fantastic and original way of framing and delivering a story-focused adventure game all in about two hours. The potential for adapting the game to longer campaign play with strings of connected story cards is clearly there, but undeveloped. My hesitation with the game is how the challenges are resolved and how the final battle unfolds. For each challenge, the dungeon lord has a base set of dice that they augment by exhausting one of four creature cards in front of them. The creatures are drawn from a deck and have no connection at all to what might be happening in the story. Creatures have special abilities that activate for certain types of challenges (strength, agility, and arcane). Each player also has an "ultimate" ability that can be used when charged and power cards that can be used in certain circumstances. Whatever the dungeon lords' result is, that becomes the hero's target number to beat. The hero can leverage skills, items and his own set of power cards as well. Some challenges end up strengthening the dungeon lord, some the hero, and some about equally. The final battle is handled the same way except that the challenges are drawn from a final battle deck that is specific to the dungeon lord. When a player wins three of the final battle cards, he wins the game.

While I find so much to like about this game, I do think that resolving ALL challenges with a competitive dice roll can grow a bit old. The thematic disconnect between the creatures and the stories is pretty huge. The climactic battle is not nearly as thematic as the journey. These are my issues and I haven't decided how much they will impact my enjoyment. I want to play it more and find out. Because of these issues, I don't see myself rating this higher than an 8 and my score could drop. However, I can't think of an adventure game that packs so much story into so short a time (except maybe Andor, but I didn't like the mechanics) and for that, this is likely a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Go to 2 player game, the variability brought in by the different heroes and dungeon lords as well as the differing equipment and cards make no 2 games the same.

The narrative elements are also very entertaining and the game is usually close down to the final battle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So much potential!! As it stands, however, I find way too much disconnect between the story and the gameplay which breaks the immersion for me. It almost feels like I'm just switching back and forth between two unrelated activities; the two modes almost ignore each other. Can you imagine if the story transitioning to the challenge phase made more narrative sense? And if the result of that challenge affected the further direction of the story?? I'd have trouble tearing myself away from this game, quite honestly. Some transitions can be made sensible with some storytelling muscle but most of the time it's quite a stretch for even seasoned storytellers to make unlaughable. It's a missed opportunity that the game doesn't allow for MORE storytelling freedom to remedy this, but it's too restrictive with its story rails created by providing only monsters instead of other elements. All of it would be forgivable, however, if there wasn't a lack of Challenge phase consequences that could have been story-related. Maybe if the Challenge reward included giving the victor more control over the story somehow? 

Other than that, the gameplay itself is standard Ameri-style fun with exciting choices. If future expansions address the issues I have with story/gameplay integration, this would be one of my top 3 favorite games!

A storytelling tactical card and dice game where one player selects a villain and the other selects a hero. The hero attempts to gather XP and treasure to prepare for the final battle with the villain (who is also gathering XP to upgrade monsters and is trying to harm the hero). A player must then win three challenges in the final battle in order to win the game.

In the end though you're just chuckin dice trying to beat the other guy/gal.  ...But there's so much more!  You can play cards to affect dice rolls, save up and use special powers, upgrade equipment, all these things to mitigate bad rolls and try to cleverly out-play your opponent!  ...But it's still just chuckin a bunch of dice for EVERY encounter.  I don't know, I feel like it's lacking SOMEthing.  But then again it really is chocked full of content and such.  8 for now, look forward to playing again, and we'll see.

One player chooses a Hero to delve deep within a dungeon, seeking the ultimate evil that waits below. Play as Seroth the Pit Fighter and fight to win at any cost, Merace the Sorceress and cast devastating spells, or Ranek the Thief striking from the shadows.

Every Hero comes with a unique character card depicting the hero and the special abilities and proficiencies of that particular character. Each hero also comes with nine unique skills to choose from which are divided into three skill trees catering to a particular proficiency. Ten signature Power cards also come with each hero, giving them special abilities that are themed to their style of play.

The second player takes on the role of the Dungeon Lord, summoning vile creatures and ancient spells to defeat the Hero. Play as the Archivist of Souls weaving dark spells that plague the hero, the Forge Master, part wizard and part machine, filling the dungeon corridors with horribly augmented monstrosities, or as Krogarn the Ogre king sending your primal horde and spirit magic to hunt down the adventurer.

Similar to the Hero, the Dungeon Lord has a character card that depicts the chosen form as well as showing the special abilities used by that character. In addition, ten signature Power cards come with each Dungeon Lord that are specific to style of villainy.

Unique Story cards bring the dungeons of Fallen to life. These cards deliver an immersive dungeon experience for players new to gaming, yet have deeper mechanics to keep even die-hard players on their toes.

This scratches my RPG-in-an-evening itch, and I enjoy the game enough that I'm unlikely to say no when it's suggested.  But a couple things are overly fiddly and the read-roll-read-roll aspect can feel a little repetitive by game's end.  Still, a solid storytelling RPG game.

A good game, very thematic.  I think the game plays very differently for the hero player vs the DM.  The DM has less ability to strategise as they just have to take whatever upgraded creature comes along, whereas the hero can look to combo with items and skills to round out their attributes.  I enjoyed telling the story, and think it is worth holding on to for when my boys are older.

Given the number of different card types, I think I'll need to replace the insert with a foamcore build.  There is a heap of content in the base kickstarter version.

This game is a gem ... a series of choose your own adventures on story cards pitting a hero against the Dungeonlord at the end of which the two square off against each other deep in his Dungeon.

The stories are well written, the hero levels up through skills, the DM through his monsters. It's a clever little system with treasures, reward cards, power cards and dice and enough meaningful little decisions to keep it interesting. Most importantly though the game is just pure fun and it's designed for two! There hasn't been such a well put together big box game for two since Claustrophobia.

UPDATE: Jan 2016 - Downgraded to 7 after realizing the entire journey to the end doesn't really change anything. The final random card selection that determines the contests that determine the winner has nothing to do with how well you performed getting there. This game is just a pretty, empty shell.

Just purchased the Kickstarter version from a local.  Looks pretty cool.  I like the choose your adventure style, and am interested to see how it works here.  Is it going to be more fun playing the hero?

Feb '15:  Played my first game, and what an ending!  James needed 1 hit on two dice to win, but failed.  The last turn, it all came down to a roll of 5 dice: could he get 5 hits?  He got 4, and the evil dude won.  Fantastic!

There was more to do as the evil guy than I expected.  A press your luck game where you have to decide when to go 'all in'.  Characters appear to be different enough to keep it interesting.  Some nice back-and-forth, so nifty cards to play. They try hard to generate the atmosphere, and sometimes I felt it.  Certainly not the greatest game ever, but I had a good time and am looking forward to my next play: with the stack of story cards in there, I still have a few plays remaining!  Is the base game really only going to be sold with 30 story cards?

Ok, I'm only 2 plays into this thing and I am extremely impressed and have been having a blast with it. I have fallen for Fallen; expect this rating to shoot to the moon as I play more. Played once with my friend Jason and once with my girlfriend and they both loved it as well. So far, I think it is a very well designed card+dice game with an awesome story-choice mechanic. If you have enjoyed Tales of Arabian Nights or the storytelling mechanics in other games like Dead of Winter, you gotta check this out. The only drawback I can possibly attribute to this game is that it is two-player only, but it is already one of my favorite two-player games in my collection. It really scratches the fantasy dungeon crawl itch too. Yeah, its a dice fest, so plenty of luck involved,  but I think luck games are great for evening the play-field between more and less experienced gamers or people of different age groups. Plus there are so many decisions to be made in the game that it feels like the luck factor is balanced out nicely. There seems to be a great deal of replayability here, too. Super cool game! I'm already looking forward to the upcoming expansions: Cursed Sands and Depths of the Glarr.

One v One dungeon crawl! Hero v Dungeon Lord. Story telling and pick your own adventure make the game.

Once you choose what challenge you want to do, rolling dice is the challenge mechanic, you can alter/add dice rolls to swing each battle in your favour.

A win brings rewards! The hero receives treasure in the form of new items and weapons to use. The Dungeon Lord gets Oman cards, powerful spells and abilities to swing the game. 

Go through 3 story cards then face off in a final challenge to see if the Hero slays the Dungeon Lord.....or dies at his hands.

Awesome two player game, and my wife really enjoys the storytelling, which unfortunately is a bit spotty at times as you can't really match it to the badguy story (though we try) A lot of setup though...but who knows maybe we'll get some one to build us a proper insert...;)

I used to own Descent, but the game just takes too long to setup, and the campaign felt flat for me. I traded away my entire Descent and has been looking for a more "euro" dungeon crawler. I was hoping to get Perdition Mouth in a trade, but that did not happen. I got Fallen instead. While it is not as euro-ish as PM, the story progression really makes the game shine. The mechanics are simple, but the story makes everything very interesting. You have to push your luck in the challenges, and manage your resources (when to use equipment/creatures/power cards/omen cards/treasure) and when to hold back.  The game is not strategic, but it is a lot of fun! Its unfortunate the game did not get wider distribution, I think this could have easily been a big hit if the distribution makes it available!

Most beautiful dark artwork i have seen in a game by far. It's a dice/decision rolling game. In the end it's just comparing u rolled higher then your opponent, but there is so much more in it then that. When to go all in for a win and when to tell its oke to lose. 

My scoring on some point:

Artwork  10/10
Just so nice every creature, hero, dungoen and treasure all are just so good and into theme. 

Box       9/10
Box is strudy as can be, with a beautiful front and back. Only the inlay could have been better, specially considering the kickstarter specials wont fit great in the box. 

Quality of materials   10/10
The dice are perfectly weight and look ike they can take some rolls. 
The cards are thick and very nice to hold in you hand and shuffle. 
The tokens come nice out off the cardboard and are thick and symbols are clear. 

Gameplay    9/10
Alot off interaction between the players is always nice in a 1 vs 1 game. Even when the other player is active you both looking hoe to adjust there roll. 
Allthough its just a dice rolling game, there is so much u can do to adjust your dices and the decisions when to do it is so important. This is more then a push your lock dice rolling game. 
The negative point is that you can't really go through a whole scenario. Sometimes the story cards say the hero has to do a puzzle and the dungoen lord will send in a freaking dragon :)

I am really enjoying this game. Every time I play this game even if it playing with the same characters the game designed has given me different choices as well trying to figure out how much the other player is holding back for future challenges. The game always seems to finds away for a player to push further then they thought. And I love how the finial battle always seems to come down to the finial dice roll. Even when you may think that you are going to win a challenge, you might not. And the game is about finding the right time to go all out. This game improves with repeated game plays. And the game provides tons of difference cards and every character you play with all play very difference no matter what side you are on. this game is working to being one of my top games I can play and get to the table almost every time.

RATING: 5.5
13-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Fallen is a story-driven game for 2 players in which one player plays as an overlord and 1 as a hero trying to foil the overlord over a series of challenges on 3 story-cards.

During setup, both players get a number of cards. Both player begins with a fully charged 'special ability' and 4 fortune tokens. The hero gets 3 equipment cards and the overlord gets monsters (level 1,2 and 3), a number of event and omen cards. 

First, each story card begins with a little flavor text that leads to a certain challenge, which can be strength/intelligence/agility. Each challenge works very similar to each other, first the overlord picks a monster that gives him a certain number of dice unlocking its special ability of the monster fits the challenge (ie. during an agility challenge you select a monster with a challenge icon). Subsequently, the overlord rolls his 2 black dice, adds the monster-dice. You can then add fortune tokens, play a card (for fortune) or use the special ability and lose the charges. The hero also rolls his dice and adds skill dice. Similar to the overlord, the hero can add the special ability and fortune. Who rolls higher number of swords wins. Some of the dice have wound symbols, that you can use to wound the hero or the overlord monsters. 

What did I think of the game? To be fair, I was not all too impressed. Many people were building the game up, but I felt it was largely a random affair with some story elements that are basically quite detached from the game. I did not dislike the game, but I was not very impressed with it either. The game ended in a runaway victory for the hero, maybe that didn't help. But I don't see how the game could have ended differently.

Have the KS version with all the extra stuff.

I didn't want to play this game tonight. Buckle also owns Pathfinder and Star Wars: Imperial Assault, but he made me play this.

I absolutely loved it. This is easily the best pseudo-RPG game I have ever played. Now I have to work out how to get a copy to London!

----------------
Paid out for a sealed Kickstarter edition and it was worth it. This is the only 10-rated game in my collection - I want to play it all the time, and don't see that changing. The different elements - from the narrative card play, the dice rolling combats, the hand management and combinations of power cards - all combine so well into a fun and exciting game.

[b]Regarding which edition to get[/b]
Absolutely get the Kickstarter version right now if you can. It is worth twice the value of the base game as you get double the heroes, villains, and story cards - these are the main factors of the game that give it replayability. If you can't, don't worry - I'm sure future expansions will quickly add more of all of those things.

Buckle has all of the adventure packs, and though well written adventures, they ABSOLUTELY are not necessary to enjoy a brilliant game which is already packed with story cards and monsters. The adventure packs each add 12 story cards, 3 monsters and 2 treasures. This is easily dwarfed by the vast number of these things already in the base game (let alone the KS version). Also, it's just the story cards which are important, and if you know someone with a copy you might be able to get a scan of the cards to play through the adventures. The chances of drawing the new monsters and treasures are quite low so you aren't missing out on the cards.
Just because you can't get them (and very few can!), don't miss out on this game because you're a completist - I would be happy with just the base set. Instead I'm ecstatic about my KS version.

This is a very enjoyable, highly immersive two-player, asymmetric game. Normally, I don’t like PvP games, especially when it’s just two players, but this is just so engaging!  I really get into the role I’m playing and live through the story in a role-playing-like way.  I make decisions based on what my character would do and ride the rollercoaster of emotions as the story progresses to the penultimate moment of who will win – the Dungeon Lord or the Hero.  I would rate it higher, but the rules are a bit challenging to grasp and it takes several plays and looking things up on BGG to figure things out.  Also, maybe this is just us, but the game takes us 2-3 hours to play.  I know this is the first time both of us have had AP moments, it’s usually just me.  If we can get to playing it faster, it’ll hit the table more often and that will raise its rating to me.  But for now, it is the game I want to play when I have an afternoon free with my husband.  It finally provides the role-playing experience I’ve always wished the two of us could have with just the two of us.  It definitely worth the wait!

Kickstarter edition with all the base kickstarer extras + 1 Adventure pack.

Don't care for the lack of integration between the actual game-play and the thematic story. Don't like the way the final victor really comes down to a dice-off at the end. I enjoyed losing to my nephew in this one, but I'd never pick it as a first run game.

I have the Kickstarter edition of Fallen with all four adventure packs and several playmats. With everything... this game is simply MASSIVE. The quality is amazing, the cards are anything but flimsy. Watchtower Games made sure that Fallen had top-notch card stock. The game itself is a two player game, one person is the Hero and the other is the Dungeon Lord. With the amount of story cards and item cards available, the possibilities are endless for different game-play each time. My only regret is not being able to afford more copies to give to my friends. Really awesome design! Great job WTG!

This is basically a dungeon crawler without a map. And it works fantastic: through various cards and abilities you you collect and manipulate dice. First the dungeon master rolls a certain number of dice depending on the scenario (each dungeon is three levels deep with each level containing four encounters)then the hero trys to beat the dungeon master's roll. After each encounter both (!) players can level up. After three levels there is a final battle. The player who wins three fights during this final battle is the winner. 

It's fast, it's exciting, it's a dungeon crawler! Highly recommended.

I want to like it, I really do, and it comes close to being fantastic. It really does give the feel of an RPG in a 2 hour board game. Unfortunately, the randomness of the game gets to you after a while. It also seems unbalanced in favour of the Dungeon Lord (in four games the hero has come close to victory only once; in the other three it wasn't even close to close). We swapped sides and characters and couldn't see what the hero was doing wrong to lose so badly.
What ultimately killed it for us was the fact that the challenge types on the story cards seem so random compared to what the story is saying (ie "fight the ogre" might be an agility challenge, whereas "steal the necklace" might be strength, while escape through the guarded door is an intellect challenge. They connect up sometimes and make no sense the other times - just adding to the overall sense of randomness and lack of control on the part of the hero. Ultimately, if I'm going to spend this long on a 1v1 fighting game where I'm rolling dice to determine the outcome, I'm probably going to play Mage Wars.

A very fun two player dungeon dive with amazing art and components. Lots of dice chucking with a really fun story component that makes the game. The only complaints I have is that I wished there had been a better way to incorporate the creatures into the story cards and the kickstarter version contained so much extra content that it ruined the retail version of the game. If they ever decide to include all of the kickstarter content in the retail game it would be a great thing in my opinion.

A HUGE THANK YOU goes out to the BGG user that helped me get my Kickstarter copy. I would have never bought the game otherwise. I can't thank you enough!!!

A good first play, but I don't need to own a copy - particularly since "experience" games are universally better with more players to share the fun.  It's sorta like role-playing with only two people.  Who does that?

Still, if unveiled once or twice a year in the proper "dive in and see what happens" spirit, it'll be worth someone's money. Just not mine.

My rating is high because my introductory session was enhanced by four things: (1) I played as the hero, so I got to make all of the adventure decisions; (2) other gaming buddies were nearby to overhear my poor choices and giggle at my flavor text; (3) the game came down to the very last die roll, with both of us tied at two Final Battle cards apiece; and (4) I won the last Battle (and the game) by a single sword.

Strikes against: I don't think I'd play in an isolated, quiet room with just my opponent in residence, as that's what wargames are for.  It's also unclear whether playing as the Dungeon Lord would be very appealing, though I wouldn't mind testing that theory in three months after the euphoria has settled and the system is fresh again.

Like: Story Cards. Custom Dice. Cards Unique to each Hero (Power Cards, Skills) and Dungeon Lord (Power Cards, Final Battle). Unlimited Replay Value. Game moves smoothly and ends in a reasonable time, even for new players.

Dislike: Monster cards are a slight theme disconnect. Some Story Cards do not chain together well. Lots of little things to remember, a good cheat sheet is recommended. Game Initially doesn't feel balanced with a huge tilt in the Hero's Favor.

Aside: Kickstarter version with all the adventure packs. Also have the Ruins Playmats, very well done.

Kickstarter edition. The game components are very good and the gameplay is engaging and tense, with a lot of back and forth between players. Altogether is a very good game. My only concern (and the reason for a modest rating) is the length of the game: should be 90 min, but lasted almost twice as much. Hopefully next plays will be faster and, in that case, the rating can increase to 8 or 8.5.
This is probably the best game I kickstarted so far!

RATING: 7
If you haven't played [thing=84465][/thing], Hapsburg Eclipse looks a whole lot better.  Ideas like off-map battles, national will, and Kaiserschlacht and pretty good ideas.  However, I did play Ottoman Sunset first, and that game introduced all of those ideas first and added a lot more things (running the narrows, coups, and the Sinai pipeline).  Hapsburg does offer a pretty good idea about managing political unrest among three ethnic groups, but really it feels like the resource management of [thing=85000][/thing]. The best original idea of it is the Przemysl fortress.

I will say that while I thought Ottoman Sunset was a lot more fun to play, Hapsburg was the far more difficult game to win. It seems like the political unrest is too difficult to manage and has an adverse affect on the game board.

But my overall experience is kind of "meh" because there are a lot of State of Siege games and this is one of the weaker offerings.  The strongest aspect is that you can combine it with Ottoman Sunset and make a 2-player cooperative game, or since there is no hidden information, a double-sized solitaire game.  If you are willing to go there, then yeah, this is definitely worth it and adds a rating point to the game.

Another great title in the States of Siege system.  Each one has something that makes it different and unique to the historical setting, and Hapsburg has the loyalty of different factions within the country.  Nice touch, works well.

RATING: 5.5
While Hapsburg does provide the player with more risk-management decisions than Ottoman Sunset, it lacks a hook. For example, the hook in Ottoman Sunset is the narrows; and the hook in Mound Builders is the first age with the culture building and the final age with the destructive Spanish army. Hapsburg wants that hook to be the national loyalties track, but Cruel Necessity does a similar track in a much improved fashion. As I play Hapsburg, I can't shake the thought that I'd just rather be playing Cruel Necessity.

Beautiful components and a great historical story telling game that is designed to be played solo.

All within 60+ minutes of play.

RATING: 7
Won my first game right out of the box, albeit at a very low VP threshold (Marginal victory).  

With much confidence, I played the combined game today of Hapsburg Eclipse combined with Ottoman Sunset, and effectively got crushed.

The more I play these VPG "States of Siege" games, the more I like them.  And the combined game is just fantastic in its' elevation of drama and cross-map interactivity.

I really like Ottoman Sunset, and this sister game hasn't let me down. There are a few more plates spinning and you have a little bit more complexity.

After three plays of this and about 30 of Ottoman, I'd be hard pushed to say which I prefer and I am happy to own both.

For me Ottoman has a bit more "purity" to it, but I also enjoy the new mechanisms in Hapsburg, such as tokens that let you roll two dice and choose which result to keep.

I like how the fort doesn't stop a unit advancing but gives you a +1 DRM when the unit has advanced beyond it, but will take a hit if you don't then knock back that unit by the end of the turn.

You have some +2 DRM tokens as well. And just a few other neat little things that I had fun using. Like being able to remove the Polish front, but at some cost.

I think both these games stand a chance of going to 10 for me and if you have one of them and love it, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy owning the other as well.

If I had to pick one only: maybe I would edge Hapsburg, because there were a few more mechanics that I found fun and with the slightly greater complexity I had a little bit more agony choosing when to use various tokens or mechanisms.

Like in my third game, I wanted to get rid of the Polish front but the counter was in the 1 box and I would have had to have sacrificed quite a few battles from the Victories box, which would have put my national will under pressure. So I decided to wait and try and push back the Polish front first.

So I guess the game felt a little bit more strategic. That said, like Ottoman, you still need to be lucky with the dice rolls.

Pfff, I didn't think it would come to this, but these games stand a shot of overtaking Zulus on the Ramparts in my affections, which is saying a lot!

Update after 21 plays: My favourite States of Siege so far, rating increased to 10/10. The luck level is still high but there are a few more things to think about than with Zulus and Ottoman, while being no brainer burner. One of the best push your luck games I have played. Would drive low luck players up the wall, I imagine!

So far I am liking this a bit more than the sister game, Ottoman Sunset.

I like the central European setting a bit more, and I am not wild about the Running the Narrows aspect of OS.

Have not tried playing the two combined, but seems like it would be a lot of fun.

I managed a win on my very first play. Whether that was due to missing a rule or lucky rolls or just fortunate card draws, I can't say. Regardless, it just didn't seem as engaging as its predecessor and companion, Ottoman Sunset. However, I still need to give it a few more goes before I pass judgment.

Coming to Hapsburg Eclipse after Cruel Necessity, I think it was inevitable that I would be disappointed. The positives are the small box and footprint of the game and the fact that individual games are short enough not to outstay their welcome. The major negative is that this is essentially a game of flipping cards and rolling dice (lots of them) with relatively little player decision making. As the game is short, you'll often play 2 or 3 in a row. But then the game does become tedious because there is not enough narrative to create a significant difference between plays. Problematic as Hapsburg Eclipse is as a game, it is even poorer as a simulation. Cruel Necessity has the same core system, but offers the player a lot more choices, and those choices have more of an impact on the outcome. It also features the (relative) excitement of the battle system.

Perhaps a little too similar to Ottoman Sunset to warrant purchasing both as standalone games. The combined game is fun and challenging but I'd say that if you own one of the titles there is no pressing need to get the other. I'm leaving Ottoman Sunet with a higher rating because it came first!

Interesting solo game in the SOG serie. I really like the historical period and I absolutely love the notes on the cards: you can see this game as you want, half-full or half-empty water glass, to me spending ops to rebuild the fortress, pacificate the internal conflicts and repel the armies is truly fascinating - there are many decisions to take here, like when to buy a drm token and where/when to spend it, or to take a chance with an event or not: the game is about setting your priorities and respond to the everchanging maelstrom of the WW1's CP front. 
Plus, the game is challenging - it'll take a while to beat it, if ever. Very pleased.

一个平庸的游戏。本作明显不如姊妹篇奥斯曼帝国的落日。最大的败笔是民族起义的设计，这个设计导致掷骰次数大量增加，而且民族起义还会直接影响战线的战斗，甚至导致游戏直接失败，以致于玩家不能专心对抗战线，还要分心来处理内务。四面楚歌系列，玩点就是在四面楚歌的危险境地中，顽强坚持，最后拨开乌云见青天，而这种设计导致了焦点模糊，特别是无任何修正的掷骰，让人觉得无聊。另外，本作卡牌的运气成分也太高，早期德国的援助抽不到，10张卡牌基本死，虽然历史上没有德国帮助，奥匈帝国确实顶不住，但是历史上德国人是来援了的，因此我觉得如果尊重历史就应该起始就给奥匈帝国一些德国增援，而不是去赌牌运看增援来不来。最后，合体游戏也很没有意思。要么是各玩各的，独自结算胜利，那么我为什么要支援队友呢？要么是团队胜利，但是奥匈帝国自顾不暇，哪有支援土耳其的余力呢？

A tower defense solitaire game.  Solid play and very difficult to win.  Models the poor situation that the A-H empire found itself in during the First World War.  Could use more flavor text/chrome in order to make the theme stand out more, but very good overall.

One of the better solitaire games IMHO.  Plenty of decisions to be made each turn.  The game also move fast.  The player is constantly balancing resources.  But it is hard, and bad luck can really sink even the best player.  Still, I highly recommend it for someone looking for a good solitaire game.

Part of the states-of-siege game systems from VPG.  This one has a lot going for it with a variety of fronts converging all at once.  Start with its earlier "sister" Ottoman Sunset which is a bit simpler and a good intro to the style of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Similar to, but not as good as, its sister Ottoman Sunset. There are a couple of weak development holes which hinder smooth play. The example-of-play is somewhat of a farce, reading like a piece of bad fiction.

Production values are good once past the annoying laser soot. The larger card size allows for expanded historical text, a nice touch.

I do like the way that internal national loyalties are handled.

A fun solo game that is easy to learn and play.  Interesting topic and can be a challenge to balance your limited resources between the approaching Allied powers and the nationalities within the empire who are eager to rise against you.  I enjoy Ottoman Sunset slightly better but this is still an excellent game as well.

RATING: 5
Fascinating subject matter and I love the States of Siege series, but this one has too many problems to endorse it. The entire Serbian front -- the one front the Austrians actually won -- is abstracted out of the game completely, and it almost seems the designer had the deliberate intention of slighting the Austrians as a "sideshow" of the 'real' action of WWI which was Germany. The various off-map events which impinge on Austrian morale/success are absurd, like the Battle of the Falklands (!) when much closer-to-home off-map events were available to put in their place. A massive flaw is in trying to mate this game with Ottoman Sunset, resulting in two completely different and unrelated tracks (one in each game) starting at Salonika. (Hapsburg Eclipse should have replaced its Salonika track with a Serbia track.) A huge missed opportunity. And, they misspelled "Habsburg"!

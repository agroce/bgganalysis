GAME: Bonaparte in Italy
RANK: 4981
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Part of Kevin Zucker's superb Campaigns of Napoleon-Series (CNS-1x) depicting the French forces on pushing Austrian forces in the North of Italy. It was Bonaparte who came to glory right here...

Napoleonic Warfare on operational level (regimental/brigade-size). 

A must for all the Napoleon-Grognards

The rating is for the game series' system only; haven't played this one yet.

Another epic entry in the Campaigns of Napoleon series. Huge area of northern Italy and small armies makes for low unit density. Lot's of maneuver, sharp, decisive combats are rare and tense.

Vecchio wargame. Ma con strategia splendida. Un cult degli anni 80.

Have the new OSG release as well as the original 1979 release (3 mapper). Probably prefer the original and the fun of pillaging the Vatican. Toured Lombardy region in May 2006.

Toured many of the 1796-7 battlefields with Kevin Zucker in May 2010.

OSG original version with 3 maps. Difficult to get to the table in it's entirety due to the odd Y shaped configuration.

Another in Zucker's line of operational games, the first edition is a somewhat idiosyncratic beast, with a massive map of the rugged Italian terrain playing host to some fairly small armies. As with the rest of the series, you spend most of your time marching and juggling limited supply, with the problems magnified here because of the brutal terrain and the French need to live off the land by taking (i.e. looting) the limited number of larger cities spread over the map. Hence the rules exclaiming that, in the real campaign, for two thirds of the time, nothing happened. Neverthelesss, Austrian mediocrity and the impact of superior French leadership means that Bonaparte still has the advantage, and despite the quirks, it is a fascinating look at a lesser known campaign. The battle system lacks a bit of colour, but the rough parity in numbers means that clashes always have an element of risk. In my Montenotte playthrough, Bonaparte parried the early Austrian thrusts and then inflicted four straight defeats on them, but any one of those battles could have gone the other way, which would have derailed matters. A neat addition to the series

Very attractive components.

The second edition is quite different to the first. The first edition had three maps sections while the second edition only has one. Consequently, in the words of Kevin Zucker, the second edition has a smaller number of scenarios, albeit the better balanced ones.

Rating is for original, three map release from ~1980. Best operational simulation I have ever played. Low counter density and lots of room make this a game of manuever. Those river lines really *do* make effective intelligence screens. :-)

RATING: 9
Prefer the early version, which I would rate a 10, to the recent version, but simply a magnificent game.  The Battle scenarios are understandable and interesting in their own right, but the Campaign game adds a few considerations that truly test the ability of the players to cope. Seldom is either army reduced to a passive defense; almost always it is the threat of your riposte that hinders your opponent.

RATING: 7
Love the Campaigns of Napoleon Series and the operational concepts. The scenarios offer very intriguing choices that reveal true period flavor. The combat mechanism leaves me a little could.  Would be a solid 8 with more satisfying combat resolution mechanism.

Own the 1979 OSG edition, essentially the same rules as the 1978 Napoleon at Bay (TSG) game.  Innovative for its time.  System also used in the 1983 Hundred Days Battles (AH)gamette.  System also influenced that used in Killer Angels (WEG) covering the ACW Gettysburg campaign.  All last played in 1980s, but in the pending tray again.

RATING: 6
Highly impressive game which evokes a real sense of period.  Unfortunately the map is very ambiguous and provokes many, many issues of interpretation.  Despite this severe criticism, it is still a superb arena in which to play out this game.  Lots of vital errata are required for the first edition which I've tried to post, but site rules prevent this in this instance.  Players without this errata should use the second edition or, for Marengo, the 'consolidated' rules.  Certain scenarios will not, however, be playable.

I have only experienced this game via the scenarios; the campaign game is regrettably beyond reach due to length and impractical time commitment required.  I have a strong sense that all the scenarios favour the French, albeit that reflects the historical outcome in each case.  There is also a 'Groundhog Day' feel to the Quadrilateral scenarios, which is not a criticism, just an observation.

I've yet to play the second edition, but a number of important improvements are immediately apparent, not least to the map, and in particular the assessment of key rivers.

Many innovative items -- command structure, operational rules, etc... But overall game is at the operational level where I do not enjoy it -- nothing has any "range." As the notes themselves say -- French units forage in agricultural Italy and the Austrians starve in mountainous Italy.

I did not play the new version,so this comment is valid for the old version.
Very good system. We achieved realistic movement although more difficult for the French than the historical event.
The start of the campaign is particularly interesting to play.

Extremely well done graphics and, as far as I can tell, a good combat system. I would have liked to have liked this game.
Downside: three maps placed in an unorthodox manner demanding a big playing area.
Seriously suspicious on the real play value vs a live opponent. As an historical tool possibly but unfortunately this beautiful game doesn't play well solitaire and the Austrian player would be bored.

Strange game, very detailed and ready for a serious simulation but instead of fighting against the opponent you have to play against the system or your army will melt down by itself through attrition. Too much difference between actual operations and what you do in game...

Have just purchased from the geek marketplace the OSG First Edition (circa 1980) properly entitled "Napoleon's Early Campaigns #1: Bonaparte in Italy". It has the much larger mapped area than the more recent reprint and includes the early campaign versus Piedmont. I had been on the look out for this one for about a decade!

Interesting situation.  The French player must be on their toes!  The Austrian player is on the attack as they try to use their superior numbers to throw the French out of the Po Valley.  The quality of the French leadership comes into play usually deciding most battles in their favor but they have to be careful not to over play their hand or the Austrians will beat them.

Many years ago, Fire and Movement magazine named this one of the best Napoleonic games ever designed and despite forty years of time passing by, this game is still one of the best. I can't think of another game on this topic and scale that offers a better recreation of the historical event as this one does. Both sides play very differently and it takes a special kind of gamer to enjoy playing the plodding Austrians. For the French, it is all about living off the land not losing your smaller army during the campaign. Good stuff!

A mini-version of the AH Napoleonic campaign series which I bought while on a school trip to London. Nice in a small way, with Napoleon fight off Austrian columns coming through the mountains, but I didn't find that it had too many options.

+ 1807: The Eagles Turn East, Habit of Victory, Arcola: Battle for Italy, and Hundred Days Battles. 

The system is a little too bird's eye for my taste; I like something a little more granular, with more personality of the individual units and commanders, rather than shuffling points on the strength tracks. 

I prefer the first edition, with all that green, more map space, etc.

Beautiful map and counters but this just didn't do it for me. For a system that has been around for years, the rules should be better organized. The player aids and charts were of amateurish quality; especially weird considering the map is a work of art.

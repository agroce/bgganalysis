RATING: 6
Another old adventure game that will be impossible to get...
[update] Or not!  Now the refrain becomes another old adventure game that will be impossible to play...can't wait for a con to play this with you, Nate!  


Finally played this at Origins '09 and had a decent time.  My brother seemed to detest it completely, though he didn't articulate exactly why.  I thought it was pretty good for what it was--I'd play it again with more players, since I like the encounter-playing mechanic and the art.

RATING: 6
Fun little Tom Wham game, not as good as The Great Kahn game, but still fun.  Lots of "mini-map" games to play and cool little battles along the way.  Quick to play and your group will often want to replay it in the same night.

RATING: 6
Decent adventure / dungeon crawl kind of game.  The artwork is poor (doodles by Tom Wham) and the game play is simple.  The game usually ends in 1.5 - 2 hours -- which is pretty quick for a dungeon crawl.

A wonderful light fantasy game. I always had a blast playing this.  Easy to learn and tons of options for your characters.  Tom Wham games kick ass and this is one of his best.  Its just damn fun.

Ancient and venerable.  I "own" this in the sense that it's back in my parents' house up in Iowa, still awaiting players to join in the quest for the Mystic Musk Ox.

Fun Talismanesque game.  Fairly random driven.  Use the advanced rules when playing, with the exception of attacking other players.  This game is worth it if you can find it.

Its not perfect, and games can drag on a bit, but it is a fun game that gets requested in my gaming groups (both past and present) - and its a Tom Wham game, which always goes over well

My original copy was well preserved! In junior high/high school then, so the rating accounting for nostalgia is actually a 7.5 to 8. Great fun dungeon crawl - actually an excellent gateway game since it's lots of fun cartoony artwork, silly puns and names, and lots of luck. I am a huge Tom Wham fan so this is always going to hold a sweet spot in my memories.

Not a bad game for casual gaming.  Not something for hardcore fantasy adventure gamers due to munchkin overtones.

Why play Talisman and all the predictable expansions when you can have more FUN with this 'little gem'? Sure it's dated and the components feel (and probably are) home made but that's the 'charm'. Not everyones cup of tea but it does bring out the nostalgia in me.

Players: 1-6

A very light-hearted adventure game where players attempt to become heirs to the throne. They must find both a royal artifact and a royal heirloom. Once found, they must traverse the king's maze to win the game. This game has comical artwork and the rules are easy to follow. Players also have the ability to harm/help other players through some interesting mechanics.

A Dungeons & Dragons Tom Wham game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Lots of randomness and bits that don't work, in a game world full of boring in-jokes. Won an overlong game by killing off my character when he became weaker than a starting character, before going straight to the Pyramid to see if I was lucky enough to get the right treasures and make it back without rolling any random encounters. Which I was.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Just about my least favorite Tom Wham game. But still a Tom Wham game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
On the shelf - needs playing.  The game folio approach from TSR is laughable - no reasonable way to store the game once used.  So I have prepared a bookcase style box with copied art and this game now has a reasonable way to be stored and displayed along side the rest of the collection.

Finally played this.  We were six, and I would not recommend this to you.  But I could see how this would lay more quickly with 3-4 people.  

For what it attempts, I think this game succeeds.  I enjoyed it, and mainly everyone else did too.  But it is not a game to be serious about.  You wander around, encounter stuff, gather treasure, and hope not to die.  Eventually either someone wins by completing the maze, or by being the richest player when the king dies.  

In essence this is a giant random encounter table for various D&D style action.

RATING: 8
What a classic game by Tom Wham.  It captures his playful and whimsical spirit so well.  The whole game is played on a giant, unfolded map.  You start out by recruiting quirky henchmen (as many as you can afford), and gathering useful items.  Then, you strike out into the wilderness to fight monsters and find treasure in one of six dungeons.  At the end, sometimes you can ambush the player in the lead so that your party can fight his party for dominance.  The guys in my youth group loved that part.

I like this Wham game enough to own 2 copies of it.  Very much a game of luck, but you have to get into the spirit of the game - one of adventure and fun... who cares who wins?

It looks fun, but my copy came missing 1/2 the cards.  :(  Luckily, a fellow Geek has photocopied them, and whenever I get back to the US to get my game, I can pull this out and finally try it.

Finally, after more than thirteen years I got to play the game.  My son crushed me: speak about bad draws.  Very atmospheric and entertaining game.  Great way to wile away a Sunday afternoon.  Great art and humor as you might expect from a Wham game.

RATING: 9
Fun, classic adventure romp in a similar vein of SFTET.  The lighthearted, whimsical nature puts it in a class of its own.  And of course the Tom Wham artwork.  It's a pity TSR didn't spring for quality components, but that is a minor complaint.  I'd rather play this than many of the modern adventure games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great beer & pretzels game.  My group is always up for this one.  It's silly and simple, but D&D and general fantasy fans who enjoy games that aren't overly serious should enjoy this one.  The art is great, too.  Best $5.00 I ever spent.

Great Game! We spent many fun filled hours playing this during breaks inbetween roleplaying sessions. The rules are pretty simple and easy to learn. Great for borderline rpg types. The Tom Wham art is of course, hilarious. :)

Really wish they had released a Mertwig's Maze Too!

RATING: 6
I am a fan of Tom Wham's whimsical artwork and vaguely D&D games. This one was especially good, with multiple dungeon/mini-games. The process of assembling a group of adventurers is kind of fun, and a battle between two parties of adventurers is a blast. But the lack of a proper game box meant that I haven't been able to play this for a long time. The bits and pieces are strewn throughout one of my storage boxes from several moves back, and I just haven't wanted to go through the hassle of sorting it out. To be honest, I actually own two copies, and the second one got mixed in with the first one during the third move, so I probably have some serious sorting to come up with one playable copy.

A huge nostalgia piece to me, having bought the game back in '88 and spending many, many fun hours with it. Took out my original copy a while back, and even with the nostalgia glasses removed, this is a fun RPG-style humor game, the maligned luck factor throwing nice curveballs along with the premeditated encounter moves, and everyone grinning the whole way through, even though none of us are 12-year-olds anymore. Definitely introducing this to my kids once they grow up some.

A fun sort of adventure game I enjoyed when I was younger and wanted something like a D&D board game. Now there are much better D&D board games, so I would have trouble justifying taking this off the shelf. Fun humor, more complexity than needed for the payoff.

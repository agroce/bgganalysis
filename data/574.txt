Fun racing game.  The worst part is that there is player elimination.  There is also a fair bit of luck in the card draw, but it seems like there may be ways to mitigate that in clever card play.  Also, there is no catch-up mechanism, so you pretty much need to get lucky in order to come from behind.

Devil-Take-The-Hindmost is a nice, captivating race game. I think it's fun to race your team using standard playing cards; what really makes it work, that lessens the luck, is that the goal is not really to come in first each round.  That's what makes your decisions more difficult than you might have thought, since game is pretty simple and fun. But I'm not sure how much strategy that really inspires. ...Update: haven't played it in over the year, in competition with other games, so I'm lowering the score a point.

I always enjoy this one; unfortunately it seems that I enjoy it much more than everyone else.  Most people don&#039;t seem to get into this one but I love the elimination mechanism and the hand management aspect of it.  Sure there&#039;s a lot of luck, but I think it&#039;s a lot of fun.

Devil Take the Hindmost edition.
Sweet spot is to play with each player given 2 sets of cards (half a deck) and a joker. Makes the game both tactical and strategic and greatly reduces the luck of the draw. Own the Devil Take the Hindmost version.

脱落式レースゲーム。
複数台を受け持ち、トップ1台がゴールした時点で、最下位だけが脱落するというのは中々面白い仕組みで、トップを目指すモチベーションが薄いため自動的に団子状態になるようになっている。
しかし、手札補充の観点から脱落して台数が減ったプレイヤーは沈むばかりであり、毎レース1台のみの脱落のためどうしても相当数のレースをする必要があり、どうしても時間がかかってしまう。

The board game equivalent of a feel good movie, this game has been THE hit with my gaming group this year. And with good reason! It is simply fun. Everything you look for in a lightweight racing game. Perfect close of a gaming evening. ( NB: we play our own 010-variant in which a round ends as soon as 1 car crosses the finish. This rewards taking the lead and makes the game considerably faster. With the original rules rating drops to an 8.)

I made a critical error bringing out this game, choosing to play it with 5 players.  It really seems to drag on a little too long, having to eliminate one car per round.  It does seem pretty heavily luck based, but I do like (and find interesting) the way that you eventually cannot defend all of your cars.  Still, the same fatal flaw that hurts most race games for me is here, and even more prominent - the need to play multiple laps.  I guess if you played with less than 5 and took lightning fast turns, it could get played more often, but it just seems to overstay its welcome as it is.

I have a primitive edition of Devil Take the Hindmost.  Bought from Lambourne Games/Sporting Deals, it basically uses the rules as published by Fiendish Games, sans bicycle figures.  

Stored inside the "Breaking Away" game by Fiendish Games, so I can use the same bicycle figures for either game.

Like many gamers, I don't generally enjoy games that include player elimination.  This is one of the few happy exceptions, most likely due to its fast playing time.

Great racing game! Original card mechanism to move the racing cars. Hand management is essential (a +5 turbo card for emergencies is always a nice asset). One of the very few games where I don't mind the player elimination. Keep racing until only your car(s) are on the circuit ...

RATING: 7
My rating for this is with the following "Turfmaster variant" (see my post under the Variants page, Feb2006).  Having the balanced decks between all players is more fair and just as enjoyable.  Basically, each player has half of a standard 52 deck plus one joker (26 + 1 = 27 cards), and recycles his own discard pile as per the rules.  This balances the randomness element for all players involved so that everyone has the same deck of cards cycled thru an equally number of times (just like Turfmaster).  
  
With an added element of randomness into the mix, I think I like this a little better than Breaking Away (same publisher).  Although Breaking Away requires more skillful tactics to play, Formel Fun/Devil Takes the Hindmost requires hand mgt. and is fun.  It also serves as an excellent gateway game that centrally revolves around hand management and plays best with brisk turns.  Once you get the hang of it, it goes fairly quickly.  It's an elimination/survivor game where the basic goal is to be the 'last man standing' or final survivor (the later you delay elimination, the more victory points you score - so, the earlier you're out, the less VPs you get).  Elimination of a player isn't a major issue as this game flies pretty fast.

After playing it once I had to have this game. Now that I do and after playing it a second time I am very happy with it!

a light racing game that is not so much about being first but NOT being last. As the game progresses it speeds up as players have less and less choices to make. Really a new favourite.

(Devil Take the Hindmost - the bicyle version)  Great racing game that has a fun level of tension.  It's hand-management where players manage a team of racers for one-lap races.  The last place finisher is eliminated after each lap.  We played with the Turfmaster variant where each player has half a deck of playing cards (two copies of each card from 1 to King & one Joker).

Formel Fun is a fun little race game. It has some strategic depth, as you have to divide your good cards amongst your two cards, and keep some of them for the next round. Although the game features player elimination, the later rounds are quick, and the game is fun to watch for the eliminated players. Perhaps this isn't the most demanding game of this month, but it was the most exciting, and the most fun.

Second play with 4 with the babelfish translation resulted in quicker races (though we did play with only 2 cars each), with some interesting look ahead moves re:placing in next race.A little repetitive in play, and the elimination still doesn't appeal; (at least in Knizia's Motor game you can still play when your cars are gone). The movement mechanism is interesting as the cards have 2 movement values and you move to spaces to optimize your hand value. However, some players dislike the game as it is still about drawing the right card.

Yet Another Hand Management Racing Game.  I thought it was decent fun, and played faster than I expected.  I like the macro-decision involved with Turbo cards.

Good fun A fairly fast paced racing game with a twist. The last car is alway eliminatd each round. Which forces places to think whether they should just concentrate on one car or spread it all out.

The cards can screw players up or make the game BUT clever play of turbo cards as well as saving useful cards will benefit players.

The last lap is a sprint to the finish and players who get or hold onto good cards will blitz to the end. Fun. Players who get eliminated should just start playing Bang! Heh.

Woowee!  What a taut, tense racing game.  I'm not sure people will be ok with the elimination aspect of the game, but for me the way Devil Takes the Hindmost forces a deck management system just makes the whole thing that much more intense as you are riding on the edge..

Brilliant hand management, wonderfully plainful decisions.  In a strange way it reminds me of the tension of Up Front without being pinned.

When played with individual decks of cards (All blacks with Joker or all reds with Joker), the luck drops significantly and this becomes one of the greatest overlooked classics in the genre.

UPDATE: Holy Crap!  I recently played Formel Fun and boy does it suck a camel's ass.  Suddenly, this tight tense game becomes a game where the winner is the player that draws the best cards, whoopdie-do.

Devil Take the Hindmost = 8
Formel Fun = 3

This one is right up my alley, and I enjoy it at least as much as I thought I would.  I think that the cards are very well calibrated, as they cycle through hands smoothly, and the decisions are quick, as suits a race game, but non-trivial.

RATING: 6
A nice little race game, although our one play seemed to go on a bit too long (they get faster, but there sure are a LOT of races to run!). Wouldn't mind trying this again, especially with people who know the rules and can play quickly.

--- Summary ---
The race track is numbered 1-->10 x 3 in a loop. Start setup based on number of players, evenly mixed. Cards are either blue (6, 7, 8) or red (1 - 9) with blue (3s, except the 1 which has a blue 10). Players start with 3 cars each; cars take turns from pole position backwards. On your turn, play a card to move that car: if blue, move forward as many spaces; if red, move the red number if it matches the number on the track, or move the blue number (3 or 10) if not. 

The race ends when someone crosses the finish line. Then, rearrange the racers in a long line based on current position, starting at the start line. The last racer is removed from the game, and that player gets VP = the current race number (e.g., 1 for 1st race, then 2, etc.).

Repeat all of above till only 2 racers left; final winner gets 3VP bonus (plus total number of races), and 2nd place gets 2VP bonus (plus current race number). Most VP wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost as fast-paced as those little cars racing around the track.  The first lap is pretty short, and the rest of them fly by in three or four rounds.  Although there is luck involved in the cards you draw, I think there is still a good dose of skill with hand management, especially in the earlier races.  When it&#039;s down to two or three remaining cars, just pray you have the right cards.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice racing game, with very basic components. Has a high luck factor while being not too short, which usually spells doom. But I can't be helped by being a bit charmed by this little game. It's always fun to taunt players who lose a car and gets exiting near the end, with only a few cars remaining. Not something I would want to play often, but great to play once in a while.

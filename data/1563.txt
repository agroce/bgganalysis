RATING: 7
People could try to nitpick this one to death, but put it in context: 1974.  Wow.  Avalon Hill and Spi were basically inventing war games, so yeah. in that context, this is a very good game.  It is very aggressive in scope and size for a hex and counter game, and they pull it off really well.  The balance of economics, politics, and combat are amazing, even on today's standards.  I like how the game is flexible enough to allow you to try things that weren't done in history to see what would happen.  As for the complexity issue, I didn't think it was more complex than [thing=3353][/thing].

RATING: 8
Nowhere near as difficult as the appallingly laid out rulebook makes it appear. Most definitely a classic although the system does seem to generate a love it or hate it attitude. I played this to death in both two player and multiplayer mode. Helped by articles in the General it has enough scope for differing strategies but none that are unbeatable. In fact the chess like quality of the opening moves and response is possibly it's attraction. It's been replaced many successors but none I feel have managed to live up to the original billing.

Monster rules. As a sim for the really legalistic rules lawyer and devoted WW2 simulation freak, it`s excellent. For gamers, it`s just too involved. It`s the strategic version of Advanced Squad Leader. Computers do this sort of game MUCH better. See Europe Engulfed fo a better game.

WW2 Europe. It took weeks to set up and play. As a teenager it was time well worth spending. I doubt I will ever get rid of it, but, suspect it will never escape the cupboard again.

RATING: 8
A classic in it's own right. 

A strategic hex/counter wargame, using age-old odds CRT and plain simple att/def-movement counters. 

The game sets up to bring each country within it's economical cum Warfare capability limits. Under different leadership/gamer, the countries may fair differently as compared to it's historical counterpart. Thus it could end up very close to historical outcome or completely different. Of course, the die plays a part. 

A very rewarding multiplayer strategic wargame that is a blast to play. Each game last more than 12 hours. But with more plays and rules knowledge, a turn with 6 players could be done in half hour. (esp the beginning and near the end. )

Another nostalgia rating.  This is my first wargame, played when I was around 11 years old.  I probably spent more time studying and playing this game than I spent doing homework for any single class during 5th and 6th grade.  I still have a tattered copy of the original AH 2nd edition I bought at Toys R Us.  Not to mention a 3rd edition, A3R, Avalanche Press's version, and GMT's World at War.

This game is MEATY. I think I've got a handle on the basic rules now... and all I want to do is set aside an entire day of playing this thing. But I tend to be a bit weird about complex games.

Now the bad: it CAN be a bit fiddly, and the rules are written terribly. Since this has come out, there have been MANY games that do similar things better.

That said, no game really captures a strategic game of the European front of WWII with quite the same fidelity (Though, perhaps World in Flames, but if I ever get the chance to try that I'll count myself lucky).

Can't rate it because I never played it. Was given to my brother and I by a friend's father when we were pre-teens (he couldn't teach it, he had never played it - he just wanted to get rid of it). Tried reading the rules many times, it looked interesting but very tedious and complex. This probably turned me away from "hardcore" wargames. I probably sold it at a garage sale.

Board in nice condition.
All counters have been counted and are present in separate bags by nation.  Original die here too, as are original 5 force pool cards.  Ruleset has a couple of ink marks on cover just above illustration, and cover has separated from the staples which bind the rest of the ruleset.  
Box shows some shelf wear on corners and on bottom of lid which would rest on a shelf.  No split corners on either top or bottom of box.  A thumbnail sized patch of white is showing through on the bottom of lid, as is a narrow one inch strip.
Great complete set.

Real men's Axis and Allies!   After becoming an ASL master, the rules for 3rd. Riech were nothing.  The game isn't as difficult as it first appears, and actually plays faster than you think.  Still, not on par with World in Flames as a grand strategic/operational WWII game.  There was a time when I would have given this a 10, but it's been dated now.   It's still very playable and if your group is past Axis and Allies, they might enjoy this.

It must get some credit for being one of the first attempts at recreating the whole of WW2 but layers of complexity without being realistic. I just disliked virtually all the systems and the way everything was abstracted with no flavor. For example, you could just churn out infantry using BRP's and get them all back next turn, no recognition to manpower shortages or whatever. The economic section was totally bland and broken. Compare this to the systems and unit detail in a game like World in Flames and you will see what I am talking about. Game was also quite gimmicky and the combat table was way to extreme. The dreaded 2-1 "4 6"  I think it was combo attacker loses all. Valiant attempt but poor in most regards.

One of the great tabletop wargames and simulations of the second world war. I have fond memories of playing this game in my teens, of misunderstanding the rules, of games that lasted for days if not weeks. I haven't played it in years so all I have are the slightly rose-tinted memories of what it was like. What I remember was a game that was well balanced between the simulation element to make it feel real and the gaming element to make it playable without melting your brain.

Yes, it's too long. Yes, it includes some cumbersome rules (the BRP accounting has a low-reward-to-effort ratio, for example). But it sure is fun to play with another hardened wargamer, and it allows for some of the most inventive new strategies of any such games.

See my comments on Advanced Third Reich, much of which applies to this game also. I rate this considerably higher simply because it is simpler and more streamlined, and so gets better bang for it's complexity buck. A game that was a classic in it's time but whose days are probably past. Long past :). It has an odd feel of being a tactical game played on a strategic map. Also extremely unforgiving. Why Avalanche would commit to reprinting this game, I dunno. Give me Europe Engulfed any day.

I had some fun with this back in the day, solitaire except for one game played with people who didn't really know the rules. It was the most complex wargame of the time - hard to believe now given today's monstrosities.  Very chess like.  A3R was better in every way in my opinion, and I played that quite a bit.

This was the kind of game that just laid out the rules without explaining anything.  It was the first rulebook I read with the phrase "zone of control" and I had no idea what it meant.

I played this more than any other wargame.  I would play it at the drop of hat.  I now find it easier to introduce people to World in Flames but I still rate this game very highly.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

I found it more of a game on something that didn't quite look like what I was expecting of WWII in Europe.  The scale is to course to show the events that took place properly and the mechanics allow things to happen that really would never have happened historically for a number of reasons.  I recall reading a strategy article talking about how it was important to garrison Berlin in the early game lest the British airborne jump in (all the way from England) and win the game.

Would give it a ten except that it needed too many fixes, and ultimately now has three replacement versions for the diehards. The economic concepts were a great idea but were written such as to allow a gamey application. That is OK up to a point.

This is an exciting game for two or more players. The rules of the 3rd/4th edition by Avalon Hill are the ones I have used most. I have seen the components for the new Avalanche Press version and find it quite user-unfriendly - I feel the original map is not as colourful but much more functional that the latest edition.

This is the game that nearly made me quit gaming. The rule book was so long and convoluted and the graphic
design on all those chits made me want to puke. Lucky for me we got rid of this game , so that we could concentrate on more accesible and fun games. This turned me off on the whole wargaming genre. Had i known about BGG back then I would have seen by the playing time of 1440 minutes that this was not a game ,but a life style!
To this day I shudder at the time spent just setting up
this mega war game.

RATING: 10
Avalon Hill  1981 3rd Edition Game / 4th Edition Rules.  This game was my first "10" ever.  I fell in love with the 3rd edition game when it came out in 1981 (had the 4th edition rules inside the game).  Third Reich is not for the faint of heart player - it is very involved.  But it was a very well balanced game that allowed good players to basically play the WWII European theater somewhat historically.  The economics were amazing at the time.  Ditto for such cool game concepts as force pools and strategic warfare.  The game is on a strategic level but each player felt the tensions that their real world historical counterparts felt.  Can you hold Moscow?  Will the U-boats cripple the Allies?  Once the US enters the war, how can Germany/Italy fight a 3 front war?  It's all there and very playable in a mini monster game that takes 20+ hours to play the Campaign Game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Is there any greater compliment or rating for a game than whether or not it actually gets played, how much it gets played, and the amount of fun and interest that it generates for players. Third Reich does not have the fanciest of components, color rule book, or illustrated scenario book (by today's standards), but this game really delivers in actual play. Once you start playing it, it gets played, a lot. And the game causes players to continually think over potential courses of action. The mechanics of play are actually simple and standard war-game for its day. Deciding what to do and when is the challenge to players. Very strategic game that also requires a good handle on executing operations in support of your strategy within the mechanics of the game.

There is a very good reason why so many articles in "The General" dealt with this game over so many years. Strategies and variants were talked over again and again at quite high intellectual levels in articles almost too numerous to mention over a very long period. This game definitely inspires a high level of analysis, thought, and study. But most importantly, it inspires you to play it again….and again. Especially well suited to a small, tight group of players.

Unbalanced. The bugs are irritaiting. Finland managed to fend of the Sovjet Union in the winter-war 1939-40 without any help from Germany, there wasn´t any Germans in Finland at this point. So the fact that it is impossible to send troops by sea from Germany to Finland is very anoying.
Poland on the other hand was crushed by the germans in less than a month. In the game you can easily hold out to the end of the winter-turn. Not very likely.
As a game Third Reich is quite fun to play, but if you wan´t historic accurancy, you will have to look for another game.

RATING: 8
Originally owned first edition. Currently own third edition, on which this review is based. Third edition nicely cleans up earlier haphazard rules, providing a concise turn sequence that makes the game play faster. This game is manageable if one settles for playing a scenario (especially the 1942 or 1944 scenarios). The 1939 scenario is tough because of all of the special rules to handle neutral countries and the start of the war. The full campaign requires multiple sessions, but is probably the most interesting way of playing 3R.

Played this a couple of times years & years ago, so the rating & comments are a vague memory. I enjoyed it well enough, particularly the BRPs, "flip-flop" double turns and air power mechanisms. I always had trouble understanding the naval rules though and the game seemed to go forever.

RATING: 9.5
If you don't have the room to spread out monster-game mapsheets, then this is the must-have game for a comprehensive treatment of WW2 in the West. Relatively simple by today's standards, but deep coverage on a strategic level. Plus, it stands up to repeated play. This is one of those games that you will probably have to buy a second time, just because you wore the parts out on your first copy. Superb.

RATING: 8
When this board game first appeared it had a great appeal to wargamers. It was a nice approach to simulate the European theater of WWII. It focuses solely on the economic and military aspect. The diplomatic aspect is played in an abstract way. It has a lengthy and dense rulebook trying to embrace all aspects of the specific era and warfare. Although a monster game it remains one of AH's classics. It takes time, space and patience to complete a full campaign. After 4 editions, the Advanced Third Reich came to give more flexibility to players, more options and opportunities to achieve more than their historical counter parts. Nice work and fine map mounted on a hard board.

RATING: 8.25
My first (and last?) monster game.  Quirky gameplay starts from the opening bell (e.g. Allied player abandons German-Poland borders and instead always encircles Warsaw with Polish units to prevent higher odd exploitation attack on first move) and continues throughout (e.g. losing a huge stack as an attacker on a 2-1 CA at 1-1 die roll (5-6)).  Can bog down with analysis paralysis as attacking player tries to maximize exact odds for all attacks on front.  But, in my opinion, the best strategic level wargame that could be played in less than one day.

2015-08-10 : When I was 15 I changed schools and met my life-long buddy Phil who ran a little wargame club at school. Not Risk or Axis & Allies but real wargames from Avalon Hilll and SPI.

This happened to coincide with the opening of the first dedicated photocopy shop in town - b/w copies for 2.5 cents was pretty cheap so I made my first print & play game by photocopying the rules, setup cards and map of Third Reich. The counters I painstakingly made from the inside of a binder.

So whenever we felt like it I would take my bike and ride 15 miles to his place to play a couple of turns of Third Reich before the evening fell and I had to return home. And yes, I experienced the pain of seeing a standard 2-1 attack against Paris fail - a 1 in 36 chance - which in essence ended the game.

Un gran juego, si señor. Equilibrado, y aunque carece de reglas de construccion industrial, y otras tipo World in flames, refleja bastante bien la realidad historica.

Recomiendo utilizar las reglas de influencia politica sobre paises, frecuentemente olvidadas. Recomendado para wargamers de pro.

Owned AH 3rd Edition. Played the different campaigns many times in my late teens, given the attraction of the Europe-North Africa-Mid East coverage. Main issues were realistically representing the short-sharp Blitzkrieg period at the hex and time scale on any but the Russian Front.

Despite fond memories, purged in favour of "new" APL version.  Still not sure that was the right move ... albeit ADG's World in Flames has better (if more complex) rules to "keep it real" in any event and "Totaler Krieg!" seems better over all.

Since writing the above ... acquired "A World At War" GMT's expanded version of AH's "Advanced Third Reich" ... a true monster: 4 maps & ~2,800 counters!  From little things (very) BIG things grow!

Cut my gaming teeth on this one, and still love to play whenever I get a chance, which unfortunately is not too often. There are only so many people that like this type of game anymore.

RATING: 4
Una leyenda de los wargames. Sin duda, en su momento supuso una revolucion en los juegos de estrategia y durante mucho tiempo fue el mejor titulo sobre la II Guerra Mundial en el teatro europeo.

Sin embargo, creo que ha envejecido mal, y su estilo no se ajusta a los gustos de los que buscamos mayor sencillez y jugabilidad a esta escala. Las reglas son farragosas y obligan a estar mas pendiente de mil y una excepciones que del juego en si mismo. Ademas (esto es una opinion personal) nunca me ha convencido el sistema de combate, basado en las penetraciones de las unidades blindadas.

Considero que hoy en dia hay varios juegos mejores que el vetusto y venerable "Third Reich".

Probably one of the three most popular wargames of all time (PanzerBlitz and Squad Leader/ASL being the other two).  Like many games its age, Third Reich features a very simple base system, but then is loaded with tons of special rules to get that system to fit the history.  This is not a problem for those of us who have been playing the game for decades, but new players would be advised to learn a different game.  The game features an entertaining and well done ground system (although the effects of being cut off from supply are too unforgiving), a good naval system, and a poor air system.  As history, the game is a mixed bag.  This is clearly a design-for-effect design.  The game usually plays out in a historically plausible way, but not for the right reasons.  For example, Germany/Italy will usually invade Yugoslavia at some point, but not for political reasons or to secure the Balkan flank, but instead to grow the Axis economy.  The final result is a game that does a good job with the "what" of World War II in Europe, but not with the "why".  For the latter, I would recommend Blitzkrieg General.

Having only played mediocre wargames, Ï got excited when I discovered this WWII Europe theater big game in the 90s. It seemed to have all that I wanted for such a game - strategy, politics, production... Today it feels outdated and rigid compared to other offerings, but still a good game.. Own the 3rd edition.

RATING: 6.5
A superb game for its time that is still quite entertaining. I love the scope and scale of the game, and the econimic system - while not terrribly realistic - was very innovative and worked well with the other game systems. I never thought 3R was as complex as AH rated it. As with many of their games, much of the perceived complexity stemmed from the poor organization and phrasing of the rules. Most of the mechanics are relatively straightforward with few exceptions;  the real challenge is swallowing the sheer bulk of material. However, someone who knows the rules should be able to explain the basics to new players pretty quickly.

The biggest disappointments for me are the somewhat scripted lines along which the game tends to develop, and the lack of interesting or meaningful treatments of naval combat or strategic air power. I'm going to try the 2001 Avalanche version, which appears to keep much of the underlying structure of AH3R but dramatically changes the mechanisms for and increases the influence of naval and strategic air warfare. It also seems to add significantly more diplomacy and random political elements, to allow a few more "what if?" scenarios to unford. Both of those changes should significantly increase the game's replayability

I have a real mystery to report when it comes to Third Reich. I played this a lot before I left home to go to college. Haven't touched it since then -- literally haven't opened the box since I was a young pup. 

Just realized that I have it on my shelf and haven't included it in my list of games. So I go to inspect the game. Box shows suitable shelf wear for a 35+ year old game. Open it up and ... it's unpunched in near mint condition. Did the Avalon Hill elves come down the chimney one night and put it back together?

And finally, what does it say about my feelings for this game when I forgot I had it? It was right there alongside all my other games! 

Oh well -- the game was one of my favorites back in the day. My first strategic game where I could be FDR or Churchill or Stalin or Hitler and change the course of the war!

Oh... the GAME...
Extremely complicated strategic overview of the European (and Mediterranean)  fronts during WWII from Sept 1939-(?) as late as 1946. Hundreds of pieces, pages of rules.
NOT for a beginning war gamer but excellent for an accomplished one.

A good grand strategy WWII European Theater game; one of my first and a longtime favorite.

If you discard the "America sues for peace" outcome, it is impossible for the Axis to win. I had actually captured all of Europe and "won" the Russian Front (you have to maintain a specific force there); when the US enters (via amphibious assault/beachhead) the Axis can't stand against the BRP growth that Rosie can throw down.

Wow. Where to begin? The only things wrong with R&DotTR are evident only decades later after a mature industry/hobby have had time to evolve better product. I don't think any criticism you'd hear today about R&DotTR you would have heard in its heyday. It was the best thing since sliced bread when it came out. Prior to its release there was ASL, Air Assault on Crete, and similar games, as well as Stratego and Battleship type simpleton games. R&DotTR was the first mega-successful game in the vein of ASL-type gaming that at the same time gave us Axis and Allies type scope.
Awesome. Simply awesome. Avalon Hill should be given a posthumous Army Distinguished Unit Citation for making this game.

Mother of all monster games.  The game is huge in scope and in scale as it focuses on strategic aspects of the World War 2.  The game is rated a "10" on Avalon Hill's own complexity scale.  It has a complex manual both in terms of number of pages and the unique concepts involved.  At the center of the system is the abstract "Building Resources Point" (BRP) which ties strategic land and sea movement, replacement and reinforcements, foreign aid points, combat results, etc. all together.  More victories mean more BRPs.  More BRPs to spend mean more military and research production.  More production means more territorial expansion until the busrt... Playing Third Reich is just like the real thing...you are tired, shattered, exhausted and dragged by the strategic decisions that the real Heads of the Nations face.  There are many sub-systems linked to the core one such that your seemingly "little" decisions would have a lasting impact on your course of war...very often such impact surfaces only after several turns played later.  I do not have a doubt that this is a "definitive" treatment on strategic World War 2.  Advance planning is a must rather than afterthought.  It is just a giant machine that simply you cannot handle it alone.  Thus, I have a rating of '6" to it only because it lacks the playability and fun factor as a simulation game.  It could have been rated higher because of its academic appeals to many other fanatics out there.  (Check out more on "Advanced Third Reich" by AH, "John Prados' Third Reich" by Avalanche Press and "World at War" by GMT, all of which are based on the same basic game system.)

The Rise and Decline of the Third Reich (4th ed.) was the third grand strategy game i bought in the 80s, after W&P and GoA. It completed my grand strategy collection on major modern warfare in Europe.

First wargame I ever owned. My brother and I bought it at Sears (of all places) back when we were kids in the '70s (1st Edition). Didn't learn to play it until I was in my early 20's. By then, I had upgraded to the 3rd Ed. map and 4th Ed. rules.

Always had a solo game running, stored under my bed, that I would slide out and play a year's time (4 game turns) after I got off the swing shift at work (back when I could still sit on the floor for an hour or two at a time). Great fun and a good way to unwind after work before retiring to bed. Never played it against an opponent -- always solo.

The fun for me was in playing against the Historical Clock -- trying to get the Axis to their high-water mark on schedule, or sooner, or liberating Europe by the Americans and British before the Soviets did (remember, I was playing at the height of the Cold War). Most of my games played out rather historically, with the occasional surprise or two. Playing solitaire was very natural, as common sense dictated the military considerations necessary to make, respectively, even when playing both sides. Playing this game really made me understand the scope and the strategies of the War in Europe. 

If I were ever forced to keep only one game of my collection, it would be Third Reich.

Still one of the great WW2 strategic games of all time, despite its age.  There are enough options for each side that you can play a large number of games without seeing the same thing twice.

My brother and I hashed out seevral sessions of this, but probably never played correctly but it filled some time during those long summer vacations where we were stuck inside.

My biggest complaint with the game is the Axis player(s) always resign before allowing the Allies to actually conquer them.  

Update:  Having played this a couple times recently, I have to say that it is a lot of work to play, and is really . . . fun!  Works best if you know how to play, but not too well.  Playing an expert would probably be anoying.

The olde classic. Despite it's a somewhat abstract way of handling combat and that infernal 3% chance of losing the 2-1 attack on Warsaw on turn 1 (losing the game) I have had a lot of fun with it. I doubt I will ever play it again though

Take Axis & Allies, jack it up on steroids and methamphetamines, and then draw it out an extra two or three hours and you've got this game. I can see why it's a classic: it is profoundly deep, and it does an excellent job illustrating the grand strategic decisions and moment-to-moment geographic and tactical considerations the military leaders of that war had to make. But it is so chrome-laden (at least, compared to most games I play regularly) that it feels more like a simulation than a game. I look forward to trying it again but am uncertain if I will inevitably prefer it to something more abstracted and gamey.

RATING: 7.5
Strategic level WWII - rules are extremely complex, but shape the theatre of battle to  historic conditions.  Many, many exceptions to the rules are included to make this happen.  VERY difficult to win a campaign game, and the last third of which was anti-climatic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Playable size game of the European theater, but too abstract (particularly compared to World in Flames).  At least it does not suffer from revision-itist like WIF.

Update, after playing this again after a couple decades or setting, I have to revise my review.  Since it is much simpler than WIF, it has a place with the other Grand Strategy games.  It is a quicker play, particularly with two people

I played this a lot way back when and dug my rather tatty copy out of the cupboard last week. I liked the production aspects and the fact that each player has a wide range of strategies. However the actual combat does not play realistically as the only place you have any room for manoeuvre is the E Front. Still, an undisputed classic.

RATING: 10
It's a shame no one plays this game any more. Excellent game, excellent development, well balanced, low complexity by today's standards, reasonable playing time, very good for competitive play. The game needs to be played in a cutthroat way, and its chess-like strategies may not be to everyone's liking. Right-brained gamers hate it. Despite its limited simulation value, Third Reich still works reasonably well and recent fancy designs do not contribute much to realism or to playability. I still play by email from time to time, and I recently bought a second copy, to replace the one I had bought 23 years before !

I know, it's a classic AH grand strategy wargame, and handles the European theater-level war very well.

Otherwise, Berlin falls in 1942 because of some oversight.

A classic from different times, I played this game not as much as I thought I would. After a while I come to dislike the almost "chess-like" openings and the rarefied abstraction of many elements of the war.

TR was, however, a trailblazer if seen in the context of its times. Furthermore, it is still perfectly playable and gives the full ETO experience on a moderate footprint (how is it fun, today, to discover that when TR was published the official difficult level was 10/10!) Lot's of nostalgia, here, but I wouldn't play it again today.

A very accurate depiction of the economic and military aspects of the second world war. Assumes some previous experience with war games. Covers Western and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. The North African and Maltese battles could be the basis of an entirely new game. Does not favor any one superpower, but the German Waffen and Luftwaffe are very powerful, economically and militarily. The game is very good when played as the leader of Germany. The Mediterranean front has the potential of being a game in itself. Better yet, create a custom game where only Axis minors and the nations around the Suez, Tangiers and Israel  participate in a 1939 conflict.

An interesting and challenging game (3rd edition).  There are many things to like about this game.  It rarely devolves into a grind, it allows amphibious and naval action, the warfare happens on many dimensions.  However, it is long and tricky - the learning curve is steep.  I put off reading the rules book for about a year (but have to confess that despite not having played it in more than 5 years I could pretty much play without the rulesbook now).

Third Reich is an acknowledged classic.

With additional diplomatic rules this game retains it's vibrancy despite it's age.

This game is not for the faint hearted, however, as the campaign game will involve 6-10 hours of play and mastering 50 pages of rules.

As a design there are a number of serious limitations which do not reflect historical Reality or are weaknesses of game design :

1 much depends on a few big die rolls and this can effectively ruin or end a game right there and then.
2 If the Germans follow a Mediterranean 
strategy and seal both ends while taking
most of the neutrals on the board then -
the German economy can far too easily 
Snowball to levels which dwarf even the
American economy.
3 The Soviets are far too easily dis-
advantaged where terrain on the map
does not play as crucial a role for the
Defense as existed during the war and
the seemingly unending Soviet manpower is not well represented as a factor even though it was decisive in the actual war.
4 Further, German and English man
power limitations which were also crucial
during the war are no where evident
in this game where if the money is there
then one can always build up to one's
Force Pool limits; a completely a historical situation.
5 Also there is no real sense of the allies
having to learn German blitzkrieg method and fumbling around with their more
numerous and more powerful tanks. Instead their tank forces are rated lower but still can Execute breakthroughs and exploitation from day 1, just like the Germans.

The game includes excellent 
historical commentaries and
despite it's design limitations and 
problems this has always been
a favourite of mine over the years
and is a worthwhile game for any 
gamer to cut his teeth on.

Game mechanics ok until Russian Campaign; you don't get the feel of endless Russian troops. The allies have to bail the Russians out; gives the impression that the Russians would have lost without lend lease.Lack of difficult terrain in northern Russia is a bad omission. The other problem is that paratroops are needed to create a breakthrough in a two hex deep line. I don't recall German paradrops to break through Russian lines in reality. Variant in General 21 # 3 may fix this.

Once the horrific rules were clarified, corrected, and streamlined this actually was a great club game -- far superior as a game than SPI's contemporary WWII.  BUT the first edition offered one of the WORST rule books ever published -- I remember page after page of questions we sent in (each phrased in "yes" or "no" fashion) to try and write a rulebook from the chaos.  I personally don't think the Strategic Warfare mechanics make any sense and they can tilt the game on it's side.  Spent a fair amount of time playing this -- not a grand waste of time -- but this is much more 'game' than history.

RATING: 7
Avalon Hill's venerable classic, strategic WWII in Europe. Units are at the Army and Fleet levels, hexes are 60 miles or so, turns are seasonal.The rule book is thick - really thick for the day, but they are well written and comprehensible, though it's still easier to get someone to teach you how to play. Counters and the map are exceptional for the period and have held up well. Includes seasonal production, strategic warfare, some interesting variants, and considerable special rules, many just for rare cases. Was considered a large game when published, but it's just a 500 counter, single map affair - still a good scale for playability. A great team game, at a manageable size.

One of THE classic Avalon Hill war games, named in the same breath with Squad Leader, B-17, Diplomacy, Panzerblitz / Panzer Leader, Flat Top, Wooden Ships & Iron Men, and The Russian Campaign. You can't go wrong owning any of these.

Sure, all of these have some flaws, but there's enough there for them to have earned their title: Great Games.

well, things have superseded this game but when I first got it, it was the best, ever wargame.In fact, my first wargame... and so many,many hours of fun. Yet, I was never satisfied with the naval rules, the Soviets were not really strong enough, and there was no Pacific. So an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played this to death when it first came out, and I still return to it from time to time. It's quirky and the western front is too small, but it still works by allowing players the same options and capabilities (or lack thereof) enjoyed by their historical counterparts...as long as the British player isn't stupid enough to leave London or a non-adjacent port vulnerable to a paratrooper drop.

One of my first serious games, consequently it got lots of plays. While generally well balanced, it became easy to call the winner about mid-way through. The success of the German campaign in Russia essentially determined the outcome, if it went well the Allies would be too slow to get a foothold in Europe, if it went poorly the Allies would make easy work of a victory. The US rarely got more than a few turns in before the outcome was clear and one side or the other resigned. Largely got replaced by World in Flames.

One of the early classics of war gaming.  Those who have begun gaming in later years should play this game at least one just for the experience of having done it.  Sort of like driving a classic car from the 1950s just so you can compare and say you've done it.  It's still a good game and worth noting how it was such an important addition to gaming in the early 1970s.

Really long game that I played a few times in the early 90's. In one, the German player's dice were cursed and he had basically lost the war in 1940 to stiff British (me) and French resistance, causing him to throw the board, and close to a thousand counters, into the air in frustration.

RATING: 6
Too long, but I've spent many hours playing it nonetheless. Rules, though complicated, worked. My only real dislike of the game was the generic nature of the counters. I last played this back in the 80's when I was stationed at Fort Knox. I played the Soviets. I lost, but it was a near thing.

I've always been intrigued by this game, but have only had one opportunity to play.

I almost pulled off a simultaneous desperation grab for London, but the paradrop failed...

Again, a highly anticipated special advance order Avalon Hill release that did not disappoint! Loved playing as a youth but constant "track" work and bookeeping insured it was not played too often in multi player meetings.
Once the PC version came out I did well working on invasions in places that I wanted to go for! England! Turkey! Greece! Yes it could be done. With much less bookeeping! Sad that all AH comp u trash does not work in modern machines without special downloads.

One solo play at this point.  Might try giving it a whirl with two, if I can get my regular wargaming buddy to look at it.  Impressive design, with lots of balancing and thought, and particular effort made to close many, many strategic loopholes.  This game is obviously a huge inspiration for many others, and clearly deserves its venerable place in the wargame lexicon

Unfortunately, it's also showing its age rather severely.  Fine-grain hexes, counters, and looking for the magic 3:1 odds ratio are relics at this point, and this game is ultimately nothing but those things on a massive scale.  If you're looking for a game of the WWII European theater of similar scale but a little bit more modern, I'd look to [gameid=6205].

Cut my teeth on the 2nd edition. Probably fortunate, as the 1st has serious rules ambiguities (I hear), and the 3rd/4th greatly increase the complexity, which I can attest to. Although not a walk in the park, the 2nd is approachable for a newbie, rules-wise. Still has generated tons of complaints over the years, but I didn't have any until after some years of enjoyable and engrossing plays. Yes, there are some flaws/quirks/perfect plans, but unless you consume games voraciously, it will take awhile to find them all, and that's half the fun anyway.

Great game to start with if interested in ETO grand startegy, and still my game of choice. You will get your money's worth and then some.

I bought this game way back in 1992. I've played it exactly 4 times. This game is somewhat like Hearts of Iron II is on the PC. Now I really enjoy HOI II but trying to perform the same things on a board game is a nightmare. The rules are nightmarish as well with many many things to remember and many exeptions. This is NOT for the amature gamer and it certainly applies to someone with lots of free time. I've never managed to find 5-6 players for this game. All my sessions have been one on one (Allies vs Axis). Although a good concept, over the years I have decided that in the end simplicity wins over players. Haven't played it for many years and don't think I will. Still a good addition to my collection I'd say

Won as allies by letting the Germans and Italians kill all their troops in 1-1 attacks on me. Nothing is remotely historical and politics don't exist either. Nobody who isn't a 'major' can leave their borders so the Eastern front is 100% Germans vs Soviets while the Finns and Romanians and friends just watch while in the Axis, and the only way they can even join the Axis is if the USSR invades them. And when Poland gets invaded it doesn't put the allies at war with the axis, so I blew my entire economy declaring war 'early' in 1939. Oh and taking Rome and all of mainland Italy doesn't capitulate or do anything to Italy or its economy - because it had Tripoli left as a major city.

In sum, this is somehow far less historical than even Axis and Allies while having 5 times the rules.

Love the box art tho', and just seeing RISE AND DECLINE OF THE THIRD REICH on the bookshelf makes me smile, even tho' it did cost tens of millions of lives. I do have issues with WW2 games in that respect, i.e, one of respect to the dead- 'I know, I'm going to make a simulation based on your miserable death.' I am unresolved- Axis and Allies will probaly take my mind off of it...

Great game in it's time. Played many complete games. Seemed difficult when I first got it. But now seems simple, especially when compared to World in Flames, or the Europa games.
My biggest complaint about this game is that a single error or a single bad die roll could cost you the game. But maybe I just feel that way because it happened to me several times.
I remember one game where my opponent paradropped on London and I was unable to dislodge him, thus losing England. What happened to Churchill's "We will fight on the beaches, and on the landing fields" speech? I am sure that Churchill himself would have hated this game. Not to mention that he certainly would have never surrendered!
Seems wrong that England would surrender from just one German unit in England.
Got lots and lots of play time when I first got it. But haven't played it in years now.
Definately one of the true classics.

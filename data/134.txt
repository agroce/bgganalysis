I would always play this again.

1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Fun to figure out the optimal combinations of the wind paths. The race is interesting since players need to choose between 2 navs and race to the finish or get 3 navs.
DISLIKE: Tile draw can be random. A little bit of "take that". Plays better with many players.

OVERALL: Not bad, fun and quick.

We talked about quite a few changes we could make to "improve" it, but I think it has enough going for it as a simple tile laying game with a single strategy.  It plays quick enough to make the experience worthwhile, but definitely not one of my favorites.  OH WAIT!  We've been playing it wrong!  We were allowing chain moves... players normally only get a SINGLE move regardless of any chains available to him.  We need to play this again so I can re-evaluate!

While this one had an interesting theme, I thought the game had way too much chaos and confusion. The ability everyone has to play tiles against opponents seems to introduce a potential stalemate situation where you can perpetually prevent someone from winning.

RATING: 6
This is a racing game that's a lot of fun, as you can divide your efforts between trying to win the race yourself and placing tiles that screw up the plans of your opponents.  The game is full of interesting choices (which of 2 victory conditions to chase, how best to place your tiles, how to spend your "sailing points," etc.) that make it a little different every time you play, and it scales very well with different numbers of players.  Its biggest drawback is the rather intense "gang up on the leader" climate it creates.

Advantages of this game is that it's quick-playing and has decent tension. Not a lot of strategising as much depends on how the board looks like when your turn comes around so it's more of taking advantage of opportunities. Overall, not a deep game but fun for a short game.

There's screwage, but it's not devastating in this game. All good clean fun. And if opponents are not paying attention, attempts at screwage may actually help the player they're trying to screw. Not a simple thing at all! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lot more thinky than you first expect with this one and so game play was a little slow and disjointed but then it was a first play. 

I like the wind mechanics where you move according to the direction and distance of the tile you begin the turn on but only if there is a tile for you to land on, which makes tile placement very interesting.

There is not so much of a race here really rather a tactical tile placement game where you must stop at certain spots upon the map.

Sold in 2015.

Cape Horn is a racing game that reminds me a bit of The Flying Carpet. One of the key differences is that the cards played stay on the board and can be used by all players. The game looks pretty dull (apart from the box cover), and the gameplay is rather pedestrian, too. If you play peacefully, players just build routes for themselves, and he who is lucky enough to draw the best tiles wins. If you play it mean... the result is just about the same, it only takes a bit longer to get there.

This is a tricky and frustrating game! I got very annoyed at not having any useful tiles and bought 5 new ones. That turned out to be a good move as I could go where I wanted. I made a double move to get within one spot of the finish line, and ended up winning the game.

Nice game as long as you use the variant. (Pick 2 midpoints and then get to the finish.) How you can win by picking 3 points and then not crossing the finish line was for me one of the most stupid victory conditions that I have ever encountered. That rule alone lowers the game rating.

My first impression is that the "frustration factor" is too great.  It is part of most race games for the players to take actions that frustrate and foil the plans of the other players.  However, my first time playing this game was very frustrating for all but one player who by shear luck won by a long shot.  The rest of us gave up about five turns later as none of us were getting remotely close to second place.  I'll edit this review after the next play.

You'd think a sailing race would be a nice and gentle game of gaining subtle advantage. Not this baby. This is the cape my man and it's amazing how many adverse winds will suddenly befall you. A turn is to play wind tiles to the board (the sea around Cape Horn) which give a choice of directions and advise how many spaces you'll move. Obviously you play good tiles where you're about to land to get big moves going in the right direction next turn. However this game is nothing but pussage from start to end, playing wind tiles where other players are about to go so they have to spend 3 precious sail points (you get 1 a turn) to crawl ahead to the next space where there might be a more favourable move on. This makes the game a ballet of plan and counterplan. It's best with 3 players, ok with 4. With more players, the control slips. It can have a catch the leader problem if players aren't careful (and vindictive!). It's themed quite well with boats tacking back and forward, finding the good wind, and it finishes in the right length. There's not a lot of tension, it's just a game of planning good plays and overcoming the pus moves as efficiently as possible.

I picked this one up on the strength of Gnomekin's review "[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/471852/an-innocent-race-game-that-is-perfect-for-total-ba]An innocent race game that is perfect for total bastards[/url]" because, well, it sounded just perfect.

Each player controls a clipper ship racing around Cape Horn; with some exceptions, you can only move the distance and direction of the wind tile you start your turn on. The game is in placing good wind tiles for your own use and -- the "total bastards" bit -- to screw your opponents by making them move backwards, sideways etc. In practice, the screwage is only light, because it's possible to spend three sail points (you accrue one per turn) to ignore the space you're on and tack to any adjacent tile.

It's quite a vicious little tussle, and it plays quite differently from anything else in my collection. There's some luck of the draw and potential for kingmaking. Plays quickly.

One play, and we got some of the rules wrong (somehow), but I just wasn't impressed.  The best moves seemed obvious, and I never really felt like there was much in the way of decisions to be made.  Which tiles you get made a huge difference, and I really don't see a reason for the alternate win condition of finishing the race with 2.  It seems really easy enough to get 3.  If someone I knew really loved the game and wanted to show me why, I'd play it again, but I think the low score on the BGG speaks to that probably never happening.

Played 3+ times.  Decent race game.  Lots of opportunity to hinder your opponents with the wind.  The multiple paths to victory make this a fun race that is often quite close. 2006/06/29

This is a difficult game to rate because a) it is so unlike anything else I have played and b) after two plays I have only just begun to wrap my head around it.

An interesting mechanic, but perhaps too easy to 'attack' others rather than focus on achieving your own goals.

I just didn't enjoy this RoboRally-esqe sailing game. It all works, but its boring, has bad graphics, is very luck-driven and has balance and king-maker issues.

Competitors can take advantage of the planning you've already done in this programming title.  Cape Horn works great, but a dual end-condition means that it can end suddenly, and that's a bit of a disappointment given the depth of available gameplay.  This heavy filler could have be baked into something more substantial.  Cape of Good Hope, anyone?

Ship racing tile placing game with an often misheard name! Present from a friend. Not really got into it but will try again. Very few games are beyond redemption for me :)  So ages have passed and it hit the table again and its an ok/good borderline game.  Alas too many games will hit the table before this.

Fun strategy game with enough depth to keep it interesting.  As a quick game, the luck element is acceptable.

Nice little game.  I love tile laying games, and here's one that allows for screwing with other players...COOL! Neat idea, quick game, well done.

Had a nice atmosphere to it, and did feel like sailing a bit.  But once you're behind - you're a goner..

Quite a clever 'take that' race game. Not too many people in my group like though, unfortunately.

Except for the art on the box, the components of this game are uninspired to say the least. And the same goes for the gameplay: It starts off as a promising brainer, but will be over before you feel any excitement.

Provisional rating, one play. You choose the wind you want from a hand of tiles. I like this more than other sailing games I've tried, probably because it doesn't try for any degree of realism.

Fairly light but a real challenge. I seemed to get all the reverse tiles and played them on everyone I could. My speed was not very fast though. Sorry it took over 10 years to try it.

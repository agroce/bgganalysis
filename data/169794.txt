A very nice coal mining game that we've only played once (as four players) but would happily play again.  It has beautiful artwork and high quality attractive components that really add to the enjoyment.

The game spans 3 years with each year having four seasons.  The winter season is where some intermediate points are scored and dues are paid (some food/money).  The other seasons are where all the fun stuff takes place.  In each of those seasons the players take it in turns to choose a set of a single color of discs from one of four abstract locations, each populated with around 6 randomly drawn discs. This is repeated, meaning  that of the three colors the discs come in (yellow, black, brown), each player will end up with a maximum of two colors of disc to a maximum of six discs overall (usually five is achieved).

On the first round of choosing, two of the locations have the downside that a water token will come with the discs. The water token adds to the flooding in the mine which can hinder or prevent the extraction of coal and they are to be avoided if possible.

Then the players simultaneously allocate the acquired discs to their workers so that tasks are undertaken, including the production of food or wood, the bolstering of mineshafts with wooden pit props, the mining and extraction of coal and the pumping out of water.  In some cases food or money tokens can be used as substitute discs.  The color of the discs taken earlier determines how they can be used.

An alternative to controlling workers is to use a collection of discs to allow you to add a marker of your color to a tableau of four rows of five randomly ordered hexagonal tiles. The first marker placed has to be in the top, cheapest row and thereafter you typically add more markers by being adjacent to any you've already placed.  There is though a piggyback option where you can place a marker directly on top of another player's at a small cost. There are points to be earned for who places a marker first, second, etc on each tile.

Players choosing to place markers onto the hexagonal tiles have to do so in player order - but the management of workers around the coal mine can be done simultaneously, so overall there is very little downtime and the game moves along at a good pace.

Lots of agonizing decisions where there are many demands for your precious set of half a dozen discs, but only a few things you can do:  should you progress along the hex tiles to get in-game and end-game bonuses or obtain very scarce money;  should you fetch pit props to allow you to progress the mineshaft; should you extract coal and get it to the surface where it can score;  should you produce food to either motivate workers or be paid as dues at the year end...?

As I said, we'd be happy to play again but I have one small concern about how points are obtained.  You'd expect the main focus and points scoring to be in the mining, which is where my friends concentrated, one or two managing to clear out nearly all of the mineshaft by the end of the game.

But I only cleared about a third of the deep mine and then decided to just go for placing first on the big points-scoring tiles which seemed easier and faster to do.  It also brought a glut of coins which score heavily at end game.

The result was my score of 60 was a long way ahead of second place (who scored around 40) and more than the  score of the other two combined.  I didn't feel  I'd merited the win when they'd done so much better than me at the mining.

So if I played again I'd be tempted to initially pretty much ignore the mining and get all 9 of my markers onto the choicest hex tiles first, which means it wouldn't really be so much a mining game for me at all.

LIKE: A better game than I predicted. The turn order and action token selection was a great mechanism, one that could be used in other games. I also enjoyed the tech tree and having multiple ways to get what you need. Plays well with 2 players.

DISLIKE: Dry, obtuse theme. Lots of edge case rules. Some small iconography. I've read that there are more points in the tech tree than in coal mining, but we didn't see it in our first play.

OVERALL: Relatively simple gameplay, but the tech tree adds in nice variation. I don't know if this is a game that could make it to the table often enough to warrant owning, but for people who enjoy the theme it is a solid game. Personally, I think the rules are too obtuse, not streamlined enough for me.

I liked that you had to dig to get out the coal, but it was a bit strange how much more valuable tech was for the end game. Made sense (thematically, investing in tech is better than digging any one shaft) but there were an awful lot of rules going over the mineshaft stuff if it turns out to not be that important.

Really neat action selection mechanism.

I passed on this game at Essen because the rulebook didn't really pull me in. However, the Rahdo runthrough made it look like a nice medium weight action selection game with some engine building through the developments. I picked it up and we have really enjoyed it. The disc selection mechanic is so simple, but bakes in a lot of strategic and tactical play. You can really interfere with your opponent, but every action feels tight and there are lots of things to do. A game that plays great with 2 and features a great strategic/tactical balance.

Solid mining euro. Most of the points come from the technology tiles and not the actual mining, but it's important to have a mixture of both. The game plays well with just about all player counts and has little downtime. It can feel a bit repetive because most of the tiles are used in every game. There is an expansion, which I strongly recommend, to add more variety. Overall, I like it and it should fit with just about any Euro group, I'm not sure I'll hang onto it because with limited space I feel there are better Euros that I'd rather play if given the option.

I really like the action selection and then you optimize what you do with the discs and...well, there's only 3 things to do every turn and it is more or less a decision on how to distribute your discs. The only way to gain coins is to go on the development track and then you're supposed to pay those coins as taxes, but why would I want to when coins are worth more points than the penalty of not paying?

Solid but disappointing, when compared to the other 2 parts of the trilogy. A medium traditional euro, with some innovative elements but not enough to keep it interesting after a handful of plays. An exercise in efficiency, but a very dry one. 

+ very tight and well-balanced
+ restricted number of actions creates some tension
+ interesting action drafting mechanism
+ the Haspelknecht 2-tempi subsystem is cool
+ easy to teach, and short to play

= the tech tree was a nice idea that should be explored further, as it stands, it was mostly a disappointment

- in a game about coal mining, it should not be possible to routinely win with minimum coal mining activities...
- the Thaler currency does not seem to serve a clear design or thematic reason other than increasing planning complexity
- the improvements and buildings seemed nor here or there. Too few to make a real difference to the gameplay

NL Juryoordeel: een sfeervol economisch bordspel, waarin je zo goed mogelijk de schaarse middelen moet gebruiken. Het actiesysteem met de inkomsten is interessant, omdat je hiermee je eigen planning kunt combineren met het hinderen van tegenstanders en het beïnvloeden van de speelvolgorde. Met een relatief lage complexiteit weet dit spel toch veel keuzes, grote herspeelbaarheid en veel speelplezier te bieden.

The third (and presumably) final game in the series of coal industry in the Ruhr-area. Given the involved nature of the other two titles, the relative 'lightness' of Haspelknecht comes as a small surprise. It is, thematically, also the eldest game, as it takes place in the times the coal mines were being started up (16th century). 

It's a bit tricky to explain in a few words what you do, as the game is fairly situational. A farmer is basically digging for coal to make a nice little side money on, and he can (must, in fact) be helped by a few salt of the earth-like blokes to make it all work. A cartload of action discs is available to select a specific action (and how often it may be repeated) but as always you want to do more than you are allowed to. By and by a hole in the ground is excavated, and the coal thus dug up sold for VPs. However, the action discs can also be used to walk across a sort of tech-hex-tree-map-thing which give all sorts of nifty extras like extra action discs, bonus points, actual money (which is really rather scarce), and more. By altering the layout you can steer how development is going to take place, giving the players (at least in theory) a lot of replayable scenarios to sink their teeth into. Players get to chose a dozen cartloads of action discs and have to contend with a demanding landlord lease as well as rain which threatens to jeopardise the mining activities. 

All in all it ought to be a game which appeals (much) more to the regular eurogamer than the other two titles in the series: it's not rules heavy (although there are a few 'little rules' to contend with which skirt close to the precipe of gaminess), features a few nice mechanisms, and overall appears fairly easy to grok. But it couldn't captivate me, and that is due solely to the amount of friction the system imposes on the players. You never have the feeling you're actually getting somewhere; instead it keeps getting more and more difficult to get coal out of the mine the deeper you go. All sorts of extras never seem to be enough. It's probably quite thematic; and likely the game wants you to specialise in but a few areas. But it's not a design philosophy I subscribe to. The author obviously does, because it is in some ways reminiscent of the action paucity in Kohle & Kolonie. After the second round of the game I was done playing, and really couldn't make myself care to put in the effort for the third round.

I had a bit of a discussion with someone who'd played the game a lot, and he mentioned the existence of a very strong non-thematic strategy. After some contemplation I could think of how it would work: run to the bottom of the tech field, then extend sideways. It would only work with the standard setup, though. Putting down the tiles in a random order, or creating 'fjords' or 'islands', is already sufficient to render this strategy ineffective... although some setups will undoubtedly do weird things. It's all very easily fixable, but still it's a slight blemish on the whole which should have been caught.

Unconventional worker placement game running your own coal mine.  There are some very interesting mechanics added to the game such as the upgraded tiles that gives in-game and end-of-game bonuses.  The way it is laid out can be laid out in different patterns, which can affect which path of bonuses you choose, which changes game play.  Also, the way you pick colored disks are interesting, as it opens up which bonuses you can trigger, and what type of jobs your workers can do.  It's a winner in my book.

Players take upon the role of farmers with opportunities to exploit the presence of coal in their lands in the southern part of the Ruhr region of Germany.
The game is set during a time when the lands were mostly covered with forests and roads were rare. Coal was discovered here, close to the Earth's surface. During the game, players obtain knowledge about this new material, extend their farms, and dig deeper in the ground to extract more coal. The game has many paths that lead to victory.

Finally rating this a 7. It's a fun, midweight game with the action selection being dependent on the discs available to you when your turn comes up. The double use of the black disc does seem counter intuitive as it can be used for multiple things but the icons don't clearly depict that. The technology advancement track is interesting and if seeded randomly with less than 4 players can lead to some interesting scores with some tiles missing. The expansion adds a few interesting modules that can be mixed in but so far the game has held up without the need for those modules. It's not a game I would go out of my way to play all the time but is a nice game to rotate in to mix things up.

Players dig a hole in their yard and discover rocky black stuff that burns well.  Before you know it you have puddles and mine shafts and you're shovel great goops of the stuff up to the surface.  The cleanest of the three "coal" games - players take action discs then allocate them to actions.  Actions allow you to pull coal out of the ground, acquire resources to help you do that, or become more efficient by traversing a technology tree.  

The game plays very cleanly but is very low on interaction.  The first game took a long time too.  Felt like I was solving my own personal puzzle, and didn't really care what the other players were doing.  They didn't hinder me.

Haspelknecht is the third in Thomas Spitzer trilogy, following on from the excellent Ruhrschifffahrt 1769-1890 and the equally good Kohle & Kolonie. Let’s be certain of one thing: in choosing the titles of his terrific games Mr Spritzer makes no attempt to appeal to the English speaking world! 

All three games are based on the development of the Ruhr mining region of Germany, all thematically strong and all three are completely different games. Mr Spritzer is clearly a brilliant designing talent.
Haspelknecht is the simplest of the three games. The rules are slim and easy to grasp. The criticism of the first two games is that there are some fiddly rules hidden amongst the poorly written rule books. Not here: here we have a simple rule set and once again a rich historical theme. 

The core of the game is one of worker placement combined with action selection, along with an interactive and competitive tech tree. The core mechanic is very clever indeed. 

The game is not hugely interactive, you each have a player board, but the battle over the central board is where the game is often won or lost, so you can’t ignore your opponent's moves.

Another winning Euro from Essen 2015.

This is an action disc drafting game where you need to mine, chop wood, build tunnels, and feed your people. You acquire the use of bonus tiles to boost you along the way and to score points.

The conceit here is drafting of colored action discs each turn that will affect a) what you can do and b) your turn order next turn. Turn order can be brutal in terms of drafting and you may get 1 fewer action or not get the color of action disc that you want. You generally bounce back and forth in turn order as better quality action discs force you later in turn order. 

With your action discs you'll do the usual mining stuff of pumping out water and mining coal but you will also use them to claim spots on the board. The board is made up of randomly placed tiles that each offer bonus powers and (in some cases) VPs. So the fun is in making the most of the action discs you're able to get each turn and putting together a series of bonus powers on the board. It was reasonably fun but didn't rise to the level of a game I need to own.

At its core, Haspelknecht is a very linear game. You only have one adit, and that (obviously) needs to be mined from start to end. Thus, and perhaps surprisingly, the mining itself is of little interest. Instead, the game focuses on the development tree that opens up various opportunities to create synergies and scoring avenues. This development tree is set up differently each game so the relative benefits can well change every time. Unfortunately, that also means the game is heavily front-loaded: The first thing to do is to scan and analyze the development layout in order to decide on worthwhile paths.

The action selection mechanism is pretty clever, and is also pretty much the only source of interaction in the game.

Haspelknecht is the cleanest game in the Coal trilogy, and the one that most intuitively "makes sense." There are still a few wrinkles that could use some ironing out but overall it feels much more coherent than its predecessors.

Opinion: the simplest of the coal trilogy, but not the worst. Easier to start playing than the others offering lot of things to consider.
First of all take care that, although it is a mining game, many of the VP's come from the development tiles.
You have your own farm and discover that there is something black that brings lot of energy and is really valuable... the theme and how it is implemented is awesome. Then, you select discs for your actions, and the way this is done is probably one of the things I like most of this game, as you have 2 rounds of selecting discs from several pools for a maximum of 5 discs.. being these what you can do later on. Then allocate those discs to a couple of actions available.
With so many actions you have lot of things to do... mine, develop, gather resources...

After a demo round at SPIEL/Essen: seems like a solid euro. Kind of thematic and beautifully produced. Not sure about replayability. Player interaction is sparse with the action selection, fight for turn order, and the come-first tech tree conquering. I bought it, so let's see… Right now, expected rating ~7.25.

[b]Update after 2 plays:[/b] Player interaction is not so sparse: the fight for the needed actions tokens and for turn order is pretty important. Paying opponents on the "tech tree" hurts, but sometimes is needed to benefit in the long run – a tight balance.

Not everybody liked it: the build-up aspect is weak (i.e. your farm doesn't really flourish in the later turns), resources are scarce, and some scorings are hard to remember (coins-to-points ratio; house-to-points ratio etc.).

I still thinks it's *good*. Keeping the rating at 7.25. Want to explore it further.

Haspelknecht's action disc selection mechanic is interesting and well-designed.  I also like the feeling of expanding my coal mine.  Overall, the game is a bit dull, however.  Turns all feel very much the same and there aren't enough tech tiles for much variety between games.  I enjoy Haspelknecht, but I'm not sure how much longevity the game has.

Solid euro in the "gain resources and spend them to get other stuff that may actually give you VP" genre. Thematically a bit more bland than I would have expected - to me, it felt more like a generic euro resource-converter rather than an economic game with a historical theme (Treefrog-style).

Nice game, but not a classic.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Enjoyed my first play (two player) with a random mix of techs. I wonder if I might prefer 2-3 player games where all the techs are not always present (4 player games have all techs available). Techs basically enhance an action going forward or give you a one time bonus as well as scores points if you are one of the first ones to "discover" them. This feels like a solid 90 minute game for a game night that isn't as heavy but still involves a fair bit of planning ahead and efficiency. Components are excellent and the game is well put together. I'd love to see an expansion with more tech tiles to introduce some variance to four player games.

RATING: 7
This game has an interesting action selection mechanism.  No matter whether a player pursues developments or mining, or even buildings (or some combination), the action selection mechanism still forces them to compete for the same disks.  It's not like some action selection/worker placement games where pursuing a strategy that no one else is going for means no competition for that action.  For example, in [b][thing=31260][/thing][/b], there's a wheat space.  Select it and you get a wheat.  And maybe you're the only person who wanted it, maybe not.  In [b][thing=169794][/thing][/b], you might want to select the yellow disks to make wheat, or maybe you want to pay a worker with it, or maybe you want to use it to build a development.  Almost certainly someone else wants those yellow disks as well, but maybe for a completely different reason.  More than that, there are only three colours of disks which define the actions.  [b][thing=31260][/thing][/b] has way more action spaces to chose from.  So, in [b][thing=169794][/thing][/b], no matter what strategy a player is pursuing, other players are competing for the same resources (action disks).  Me likes.  On the other hand, the game is kind of soulless.  I really don't feel I'm a farmer-turned-miner.

First play was good. Very nice artwork, interesting decisions on choosing your actions and which developments you're going to go after. First play went a little longer than I expected but I think this was largely due to the players and our trying to iron out a few rules. I'm hoping this will shorten, and if it does, I think it will fit a very nice niche in my collection.  My first of the Kohle trilogy. I think thematically it comes first, and as it does makes a very nice introduction as it is much simpler than the others.

Despite having real good decisions to be made the core mechanics of the game are very simple, and I like this.

Players will have to balance these decisions, what discs to get to be able to do the actions they need to do... mine, get wood, get food, drain water, get developments, what to do when... some very hard decision, shall I take those 3 black discs and hope no one takes those 2 brown ones I need for the wood or do I secure the wood and risk losing the black discs? What development should I get?

great great game!!!

A coal mining themed game in which the various action selection options are determined by coloured discs selected at the start of each range from a randomised display.

Haspelknecht is yet another euro game where you need to convert resources to victory points with limited actions. What differs this game from the rest then? One thing is the action markers, where you choose number and colors from different areas. This provides some tension, as each player tries to find "his or her" combination before the other players grab them. Another thing is the "technology tree", where the players can exchange action markers for various benefits and where whoever takes a benefit first get paid when other players want the same benefit.

However, this is not enough for a game so Haspelknecht also has a point salad where you have to specialize among the many opportunities given by the variable technology tree. This is enough for a decent game but not for differing it from the many other games out there.

[b]Haspelknecht[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Two years later... thoughts and rating (?)[/COLOR]

I just reacquired Haspelknecht after talking with my son. We both had enjoyed our few plays, but the lack of variety and influx of other new games lead to the game leaving our collection. With the new expansion and huge purge of games I decided to pick up Haspelknecht again along with the expansion. I'm really looking forward to playing, I've heard good things about the expansion.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]In the end my closing thoughts on Haspelknecht a year ago ended up sealing it's fate. While I really thought the way you selected your action discs was a fun and innovative mechanic the rest of the game didn't bring anything new to the table. On top of that once you choose your action discs the decision space for the game feels quite narrow and mostly straight forward. 

While I don't think Haspelknecht is a bad game, there are too many other games of a similar ilk competing for table time and Haspelknecht was at the bottom of that list so I ended up getting rid of my copy.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful artwork, and great component quality which help bring the theme to life.
- Choosing the action discs is a great mechanic, it introduces some tension into the game, especially since there is a penalty for choosing from one of the sections with your first selection.
- Haspelknecht is much lighter than I thought it would be and as such fills a spot in my collection as a lighter weigt Euro that gives me a similar vibe to Uwe Rosenberg's heavier games, but may not have the replay value I thought it would.
- So far the balance seems good between harvesting coal and going for developments, I've read a lot of commentary about developments being the way to go but that hasn't necessarily been the case in our plays.

While Haspelknecht ended up being my favorite game of the month, I am a bit concerned that it may not have replayability I expected. I thought it would be similar to an Uwe design with lots of depth to explore, but in reality the choices in the game are quite straight forward. Thankfully the game play is quite engaging, I especially appreciate the tension found in choosing which action discs to take. I would agree with a few other people who's thoughts I read about this game, I definitely think it will benefit from an expansion (especially development tiles).[/i]

Haspelknecht is the shortest, smoothest-playing, and possibly the best game in Spitzer's "coal trilogy". You're trying to excavate all the coal from your player board, using a fairly clever action selection mechanism. It's the kind of game where there's lots you want to do, but resources and actions are always very tight, so what you can accomplish is very limited. The development tiles (basically a tech tree) provide lots of good options, and setup variability is a plus. Enjoyed this quite a bit.

(2 plays)

RATING: 9
Absolutely astounding game. While the premise is simple (mine coal), there seems to be a lot to play around with in the development tiles. With an alternate setup on the back of the rulebook, the game goes from being rote, to needing to plan a path and work your way down it. Gaps in tiles make it difficult to get the tech you want and you really rely on others to get there first if you can't. A lot of room to explore different strategies (money, storing coal or other things for points, fully excavating, etc). Plays best with 3, but all player counts are great. This game definitely rewards repeat plays.

A few rules issues that we ran into:
1. Wood can only be placed in the mine once the pinge is cleared.
2. You can take more than 5 discs. Only on the first selection if there are 6+ of the same color. Highly unlikely, but it can happen.

Includes The Foreman Promo Tile.

Beautiful game. Mining with action selection. It is a very nice game. Critical thinking with the available discs each round. Very limited actions so you really have to make it all work in the time frame of the game. You can't do it all so you have to specialize. 

There is a good balance in this game. I wonder if it will get stale after 10 plays (or sooner) Make me question replay value. We will see!  I have high hopes! Also curious about 2p. I will have to try that out too.

This is a game about running a small coal farm. The game lasts three sets of three action rounds. In each round, you select the actions you want to do by removing all the disks of one color from one of the action selection boxes. Then, everyone you adjust turn order based on the disks people took, and actions get resolved. I should note that the disc reset process is pretty tiresome.  Every turn the discs return to the back, and then come out again.

The color of the discs you draft determines which actions you can take. This is definitely one of those games where they set the clock to be one turn shorter than you'd like to comfortably achieve your goals. In general, you gather materials to pay the tax each round, farm coal out of your player board and buy discs on the hexagon technology tiles in the central areas.

The experience of the game is quite good, but different plays of the game don't wind up feeling very different.

Interesting action taking mechanic by selecting discs of one colour from one of the six pools of discs available, starting player advantage is always good.

This is one of the most thematic Euros I have ever played. Everything flows so smoothly & intuitively. Once you grasp the rules, there's hardly any need to refer to the rulebook again. I love the action selection and how tight the game feels for 2p without any drastic changes. The artwork is incredible!!! It really does a wonderful job of drawing you into it's world. I never thought a game about coal mining would evoke so much fun for me. Haspelknecht is an excellent middle weight. Looking forward to the expansion cause the game starts to feel samey after multiple plays.

Just bought the expansion and I got a feeling it is going to really elevate this game to a different level. Let's see.

RATING: 7
Plays better with four players due to all the development tiles being available. On the other hand you want those four players to be quick with their turns - which they should be because much of the game is simultaneous selection or close enough that nothing will mess with your plans very  much. Only the resources disc selection takes a bit of thinking time. The rest is quickly just running through the motions. With the game only being nine turns long it feels like you're busy throughout. Yet it turns out that coal digging isn't that exciting. I wish the water issue was more of an issue. I wish that the developments were more of a resource challenge to acquire. I wish that I didn't have to keep such an eye on all the little points I pick up here and there for being such a coal digging farmer. The game is reasonably good, but for a game about digging up coal it seemed that acquiring development abilities was more of the story than coal.
A below average rulebook is somewhat annoying for the beginning of the first play. A few ambiguous issues are resolved through logic, but it's just a bit careless and unnecessary for what is a very simple game. Don't call something "pit water" when it's just "water".
I'm a fan of history and that means being a fan of the history of coal. I'm the perfect target audience for a game about the history of coal in Germany. But the game didn't quite hit the mark. It didn't entirely miss either. I'd like to put my finger on why I'm not a big fan. Perhaps the clever two cart action system that works so well here needs some sort of background story how it fits the theme? I don't know. Anyway, I'm happy to play further and am somewhat interested to see how the expansion enriches the game.

Played at Essen. Did not live up to expectations. The rules need tweaking to make this a better game. The limit of taking 5 resources during the drafting phase makes zero thematic sense and hurts the gameplay.

A fun sort-of action selection game with a coal mining theme. Like other mining games, you have to dig stuff up, transport it, and manage water accumulation. The action selection mechanism is really cool. It's similar to the one used in Last Train to Wensleydale (First Train to Nurenburg): there are pools of random assortments of action discs from which you choose (each color corresponds to a different action type). Here, though, you (twice) choose only a single color and take all discs of that color from the box (max 5 total per turn). Also, you get to see partial information about what discs will be available on the next turn. After choosing, players simultaneously allocate their discs to the workers on their board. Then, in turn order, you take your actions -- digging for coal, getting wood (used to support tunnels), clearing water, build a development to advance on tech tree, etc. The developments have a variable setup so your progression will be different every game. 

Very fun game, with really just one problem: the icons are too damn small! Many of the development tiles give you VP based on a variety of icons you have, either on other developments or on your player board. But the board icons are so small that it's hard to distinguish one from another! 

Still, very good game I'd be happy to play again!

Nothing wrong with the game (clean design) per se, but it's way too light for our tastes - kind of an odd way to end the series (this would serve better as an introductory game).

Oh, I can't fathom how the deep/sideways prevailing strategy (fixed post-release) escaped the playtesters - really?

tl;dr: good strategy game!

We've gotten a ton of games about mining in the last couple of years, and here's yet another one. This time from the same designer of one of the best ones, [thing=141090][/thing]. But where that game focuses more on building a mining industry, this one tackles more of the actual operation of the mine, closer to [thing=143515][/thing].
What I liked about this game is that it has a nice mix of mechanisms, some of which are not overused but most of all it seems the game offers different paths to victory.
This asks for some more exploration!

Solid optimization game that is also a brain-burner. On top of that, it is highly thematic in the way it builds up its optimization puzzle. The number of options and sub-systems feels overwhelming, but in a positive way. Just be prepared for some AP. I've only played once. My rating could rise if the game-space proves rich and varied, or remain the same if it feels repetitive and scripted (and I'm worried).

Haspelnecht is an action selection game about coal.

At the beginning of a season, players take discs from a public display. There are three types of action discs (Gold, brown and black) which dictate the actions you can take in the round. Additionally turn order is dictated by which discs you take. You're limited to taking five discs, with the first set of discs you take counting towards your "turn order total". After you take your first set, everyone else takes theirs and then you take another set. However, due to the random distribution, you may not be able to get five discs every season. Or you might not be able to get the discs you want. Or taking the discs you want might put you last in turn order. Further complicating matters is that some discs come with "pit water" which is bad.

Turn order is calculated by the sum of the first set of discs you take where golds = 3, browns = 2 and blacks = 1. Turn order is reset by lowest to highest, with ties inverting their existing relative order.

After turn order has been reset, players assign their discs and then resolve them in turn order. Generally black discs either remove pit water (which must be done to mine coal and haul it to the surface) or mine coal. Brown discs produce wood (which must be used to build your mine shaft). Gold discs produce food, or pay your haspelnecht (the guy who lifts coal from the mineshaft to the surface). Additionally, you can build developments, which cost different combinations of discs.

Developments give you points if you're the first to build them, but also give you some bonus or scoring opportunity. There's an adjacency rule in building them (which can be broken painfully) so planning out a path is important.

Every year, you'll have to sacrifice food and/or gold to the local deity or take negative victory points. Then you'll score point based on how much coal you've collected. At the end of the third year, the player with the most points wins. There's lots of ways to get points in addition to coal. Digging out your mineshaft produces a lot of points. Having leftover money gives a lot of points (but is really hard to do). There's some set collection type of stuff going on with the developments you've built.

There's not enough time in this game and getting the action discs you need can be hard. Most of the game will revolve around getting coal dug out and building your mineshaft and then building developments. The developments you build seem particularly important.

I enjoyed the game a lot and am looking forward to playing again.

Love this game. We played 3 times using different setup for the technology tree. It was interesting to see how games go very differently. Each action is short, but lots of things need to be considered. I am tired of games with lots of combo. This game does not focus on combo making but address more in making decision. Put those short and direct actions together, gradually figure out how to generate the victory points. It is fun! By the way, the gaming time is short, but the game and coal is quite deep. Try hard to dig them out!

Very well oiled machinery but it lacks a Wooow factor.

[+] great production (artwork, components), love the random "tech tree", figuring out a good path through the tech tree is one of the best part of the game 
[-] no sense of progression during the game (you don't get more actions nor better actions, it's pretty much 4/5 discs to the same things all game long), like Agricola you have to do a bit of everything, end game is not exciting (counting various VP), 1 big mistake in rulebook (both FR and EN) regarding "advanced farmer"...

The third game in the coal trilogy is markedly different from the first two: the rules are more concise and the presentation and components are a bit more polished. If the development board had a bit more interaction I might like the game more; as is the penalties for not being first to claim an area are too soft to induce tension. I would have preferred that either it was possible to get blocked out, or at least one had to pay a truly onerous amount to get in. Right now the only real interactive tension is during the action disc drafting phase, and that mechanic altogether is bound to get old quick if there's nothing else of note complementing it. In sum- unremarkable.

RATING: 6
The action selection draft is the most interesting part of Haspelknecht. You have three or four workers and what they can do depends on what color disks you can draft and how many of them you acquire. What makes this tricky is that when you draft a disk, you must take all disks of that color. So if you only need one and every lot contains three, then tough luck...you better figure out what to do with the other two! (You are capped at five, so getting four disks when you needed one really limits your options on what you can do in a turn.)

The rest of the game is just stuff to do. Generally speaking that's mining coal, but you can do well ignoring that and instead exploiting the tech tree and scoring your points there.

It's a perfectly serviceable Euro, but for some reason it didn't grab me. I think it is because the game's tech tree tends to provide single use rewards, instead of permanent bonuses. I would think that if I invent a better system for draining water out of the mine shaft, I would permanently have less water in my mine shafts, not simply have less water for a turn. It's a minor thing, but it bugs me...I guess it makes the tech tree feel too tactical, maybe even gamey. This game feels like a history lesson, but at no time does it feel like things are advancing, because the turn after you invent a bucket, you seemingly forget how to use it.

it works. but it's too complicated, with little exceptions and details that make it quite inelegant. Like "take disks, same colors, no more than 5, from there and there take a drop.

Economic strategy sim where farmers expand into coal mining on their farms in southern Germany. Draft action disks from randomly seeded groups in the planning phase is unique and engaging. First round players draft all of a single color that represent mine, logging, or farm actions. There is forecast pools to know some of the actions coming up for the next plan phase to consider. The modular tech tree creates an interesting challenge to find the best upgrade path to expand the farm or improve implements to increase worker actions. Very thematic dealing with pit water before mining after rain season. I like the bonus action from synergy of workers. Intuitive to learn and fun play.

Don't be fooled by the theme; digging for coal might not be as exciting as fighting your way into Walhalla, but there is a surprising amount of strategy to digging up that black gold. The action selection system is quite unique. They could just have easily made this into a mondane worker placement where everyone has the same actions at their disposal. Now, you have so many things to keep track of; which actions will I get this round? Do I take water in order to get the better actions? Which pawns do I leave for the next round? What will the player order be in the coming round? It's a very neat and intricate system, but it works surprisingly well. You also have different strategies at your disposal; do you go engine building with lots of property tiles? Or do you go for quick wins and victory points? Lots of things to love about this game. The artwork isn't my cup of tea, but the gritty colours and lines definitely complement the theme. Digging for coal is a dirty job, so the game can't be too pretty. So don't be blinded by the ugly box and try this awesome game for yourselves!

I've played about 15 minutes of this game, and the rules weren't explained very good. I need to read the rules for myself, and try it again. It looks good, and I've played other games I liked, from the same designer.

Meh.  I can see how it might appeal to more analytical gamers, but for me it just doesn't have the spark of genious to make me want to do the analysis or enough going on to really keep my interest.  It's a basic stock market game.  You develop a holding, flip it for a profit, and then repeat.  The plagues add a random screwage element that can be managed but pretty much just slow things down.  Basically you play the odds, flip the holdings, and hope to eek out a marginal victory over your opponents.  Not my kind of game.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games which the rules manage to make sound confusingly complex but which is straightforward enough once you get going and have checked back with the rules a few times. What it has in its favour is a pretty unique feel, so much so that not even any distant comparisons spring immediately to mind.  There are also a number of compensatory mechanisms built into the game which make it hard to build up or maintain a dominant position.   But?  Well ... but it may be a bit too long for what it offers.  I think.  Maybe.  A further play while the rules are still fresh in the mind is needed to see whether that is an accurate impression though, so don't let it put you off.

Really nice game from one of my favourte designers. Stefan Dorra. A nice bundle of choices on each and every go. Get the most money from your buildings and squire/conday imports. Timing is a big part to winning this game, Get the most income before the plagues lower your income. 4 Plays.

RATING: 7
The game combines elements from Carcassonne and El Grande into something new, better than each of its predecessors. 

Its thematic, having lots of player interaction with some surprise elements and thus medium luck factor, while still being a strategic game. I very much like the limited team-up option provided, which encourages teaming but prevents players from excessively cooperating too.

BIGGEST DRAWBACK: A four player game may unintentionally evolve into a 2 vs 2 game and it may be hard to break up the alliances.

Solid euro in the style of T&E with interesting use of cards to determine player order and actions. The English rules seem unnecessarily complicated. It's really quite simple. Lots of bash the (perceived) leader type of play.

Tile-laying game. Very interesting. Hard to compare to other games. When you lay a building tile you can put a dude on it as well. Later in the game you can sell the buildings you own and get points for other tiles of the same color/type as the building.  You are playing against other people, but other people can get help as well.

RATING: 7
A mixture of mechanisms - spot El Caballero, Carcassone, Eden, ...  but the game itself, once you've conquered the English translation plays fine.  Reasonable game, not Earth-shattering, but quite playable.  NB the box at Essen said includes English rules - but it didn't.  But they are up on the Zoch website so fine.  All components are language neutral, so no need to wait for any English edn.  5p seems to work fine - there is little downtime, though probably better with 4.

Boring game of churning small amounts of victory points through repeating the same simple tactics and activities ad nauseum.

Hm, I'm still unsure if I should keep this game or not, but I gues I won't. Away from being just another of it's kind without anything new, it works quite well.

You can blow up your opponents plans, but it seems that it's too costly to be nasty, as you won't do anything on your own then, so it does balance itself out.

Well, a good game, but nothing you need to own I guess.

As a 2-player game this functions quite nicely. It's a mixture of mechanisms and for me feels like mixing New England, El Grande, Tigris & Euphrates and a bit of drafting. Plays fast, there's both luck and tactics included and it felt like it could be a bit chaotic and hard to follow with more players. The endgame might be boring depending on whether you happen to draw all the buildings in the early game.

The rules aren't well laid out and we played incorrectly due to the resulting confusion our first time through.  The second time proved a good bit more interesting for me in this "stock market" type game where you are building regions and seeking to cash them in at what you think will be the best time.  Cards will allow pestilence to lay waste temporarily to your holdings.  There might need to be a tweak in how cards are initially distributed as it can contribute to a slow start from which it is difficult to come back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game combines elements of Carcassonne (tile-laying and claiming tiles with meeples) and El Grande (auction for turn order). As such it should be a good game.

Unfortunately I found many of the rules fiddly and the "take that" component takes over the game.

(side note: the money quality was outstanding and I almost kept the game just for the bits)

RATING: 4
This game just bores me to death. It brings nothing new, since all mechanisms have been there before in games with much more thematic feeling. There is nothing wrong 'per se' with this game it's just lacking the magic that makes games interesting.

Missed the rule during first playing about the lowest value card (i.e. the person expanding power last) being able to use the card's special ability and to also perform action A or B; take tiles or place a conde. Would have made a difference and made the game more cut-throat maybe.

Some really nice mechanics that come together in a relatively quick game that requires some depth of thought without slipping into AP as well as making you react to the plays of others.

"Tile-placing board games" is a very broad category, but this plodding, screwage-heavy affair really invites unfavorable comparisons to the likes of Tikal and Tigris & Euphrates.  Stefan Dorra remains a designer whose games I approach with trepidation.

This is a strange twist on a stock/investment game where you want to increase the value of the castles that you've invested in to gain some income and then to turn them over for a profit.  Although the twist is that it more acurately mimics land develop than I would expect.  The card action system is pretty straightforward and allows for a higher level of control than what you would first think. The game plays light and quick and has a healthy amount of interaction.  Certainly, this is a game that could garner a higher rating with more plays.

Fiddly rules that take a game to learn well. Game is all about laying tiles, scoring buildings, placing Condes, and placing plagues on your opponent.

RATING: 7
Fun game! How did I not play this earlier?!

Tile-laying, area control (sort of), and timing: sell off buildings, discarding the fertile tiles before your opponents can do so! The card-passing works pretty well, similar to Die Saulen von Venedig. Even the 5-card special power works nicely! 

--- Summary ---
Setup: place starting tiles (orange-backs) in random locations on board. Deal cards out evenly to players (2 sets 1-10, shuffled; some removed if playing with low (with 1 exception: if 5 is lowest card, it goes first).

On your turn, either take the card action (1-4 allow you to place/move a type of plague token to a tile), take a tile action, or place/move your nobleman. Again, 1 exception: the last player may take the card action AND one of the other 2 actions. 

Tile Action: take all tiles in any of the n stacks and place them on the board. If placing building(s), may place/move one of your 3 squire tokens onto it (if moving, must sell building at current location then pay VP equal to new building's value to place squire). When selling building(s), earn VP = building value (2, 3, or 4) + value of orthogonally adjacent landscape clusters (1/tile, except "fertile landscapes" that are worth 2 or 3 each) - plague modifier. If a nobleman is present, that player earn's same VP - building value. Any scored fertile landscape tiles are removed from the game. May not sell a building if you just placed it, or if you just placed a fertile landscape in an adjacent region.

Nobleman Action: may place/move your nobleman to a building with another player's squire token, unless another nobleman already present or that cluster is worth 7+ VP.

After all players have taken their action, all clusters of building/landscape worth 7+ earn their squire 2VP and nobleman 1VP.

Each round ends by passing the played card to the left.

Game ends at end of the round in which the last tiles (blue-backs) are added to the stacks. Most VP wins.

RATING: 7.5
Apparently we missed a key rule about "income," where if I gather correctly you should be paid VP at the end of every round for your existing holdings.  This will change the flow of the game from one where you're content to sit with a penalty marker on one of your fields for several turns, since all you really need is to have it cleared off once, long enough for you to score it -- the game we played -- to one where your incentive to clear away the penalty markers is more urgent, and thus they will get moved around more and (as a side effect) there'll tend to be larger stacks of tiles available from the display.  Even though we played it wrong, from what we did see, we enjoyed the game (and in particular liked the cards system very much), and I feel it's going to be a really good game once we've corrected our reading of the rules to encourage more fluidity in the board situation.

An unusual tile-laying game that's balanced to the point where it's tough to gain much of an edge over your opponents. The turn-order card-selection process is pretty clever. Not quite a brain-burner, but there's an awful lot to think about here. We did have a number of rules questions (things like whether certain actions were mandatory) that were left ambiguous in the rules and really should have been addressed. In the end, Salamanca, while interesting, is a little too slow and dry to stay in my collection. If you're a big fan of tile-laying games like Tigris & Euphrates and Mexica, this is probaby a must-try for you.

Sort of an odd mish-mash of familiar mechanics from other games + the hot new thing of using a card and passing it on. The end result is a bit bland, but certainly engaging enough. There's some significant screwage involved that seems a little out of place. Mostly it seems like you move the plagues around to get them away from yourself, rather than doing something fun or interesting with them.

It is a bit of a defensive/offensive struggle which makes a good game. All the cards have different functions. The high card goes first, most of the time. But players will play a card one round and pass it to the left after they use it. There are lots of options. Interesting card play. A winner!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The gameplay itself is fairly obvious with little to no surprises.  Most of the rounds ends up being a contest to see who can go last in order to take the extra card action as well as to place tiles or the conde (not to mention having the opportunity to start first in the following turn).  It certainly didn't help that the copy we played with had a horrible translation of the rules that left us scratching our heads on more than one occasions.  The only upside to the whole thing is the opportunity to wreak havoc by selling off buildings which result in the removal of certain landscape tiles from the board, thus reducing and sometimes even isolating other people's holdings.  Still, the possibility of cutthroat plays did not hold my interest for long.  A forgettable experience for me.

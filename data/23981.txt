RATING: 6
A decent tile-placer with very simple mechanics.  Initially I was bothered by dice rolls determining the tiles I could place, but there is actually more control here, thanks to wild die results, than in Carcassonne's random draws.  Genesis is reminiscent of Acquire in that it pays handsomely to have the majority holding in the largest area.  As with Acquire there are also possibilities to pick up points from much smaller areas.  Also like Acquire, although Genesis has a theme (competition between species for land in prehistoric times), the veneer is pretty thin. 

Production quality is good, the artwork is ugly, though functional.  The rules are reasonably clear, though the rules on scoring needed a second read-through.

RATING: 5
Abstract spatial set building and area control game driven by dice. Played 3 times (2 and 4er games). It's a mostly tactical game with limited depth as moves are generally expected, simple and flat. In that respect, it is quite approachable from the casual gamer's perspective other than the endgame scoring which is a bit of a chore. The game arc is also fairly flat with not much difference in tactics/strategy from start to finish. The lack of cumulative effect from the simplistic game turns means that there isn't a sense of accomplishment for any particular game turn, nor over the course of the game. Better with more players.

Egy egyszerű (5 perc a szabály), pörgős, de mégis jó többségi játék. Sajnos nem túl szép, de 2006-ban ez még elment... Ha mindenképp egy másik Kniziához akarnám mérni, akkor azt kell mondjam, ez sokkal jobb, mint a Mamutvadász! Nagy szabadságot ad taktikailag, bárhova pakolhatjuk a lapkákat, ez tetszik. A királycsinálás lehetősége viszont benne van elég komolyan.

Fun Knizia tile laying game. Roll dice with the 4 different colored species and then place those tiles out. Score at the end for largest and second largest groupings of same tiles on the board. Simple, but has some deep strategy as well. In Trade pile as another gamer in my group received a copy as a present.

Abstract area control game - theme is totally pasted on and wafer thin. But it's okay, definitely more than one strategy you can adopt, and significant player interaction. Might work with kids if the complicated scoring at the end is simplified. 
*** update - works well as a 2 player game, rating has increased, currently I like this one, not sure if the shine will come off or not. Definitely more depth than first appears.

Actually not a bad filler game.  Much better than I expected just from reading the rules!  The game is fairly tense as you hope you get the die rolls you need and try to block other players, as well as trying to control which areas will get the bonus scoring.  Overall, I liked it, but it's nothing to get overly excited about either.

1 play (2p). I like the super easy turn actions and nice components. Understanding the scoring, and the impact of your turns' decisions, requires extra effort and maybe some counting. But again the super easy turn actions make it easier to focus on the scoring impact possibilities. Also it's pleasant how the course of the game adds color and visual vibrancy to the board. I need to play more, and with more players, to assess. (If there's cavemen in a game, I also want dinosaurs.)

Well it's another abstract Knizia game with an irrelavant theme but I quite enjoyed it. It plays quickly and has a bit of randomness to keep it interesting. Like to pick this one up and play it again. Based on one play.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Siempre quiero jugarlo. Tal vez debería de darle un 7 o un 6 pero me gusta. Un juego que amaras u odiarás. Debe tratarse como un Can`t Stop mas que como un Tigris. Genesis es el nuevo complemento a la famosa ¿triología? Juego solo recomendado para la gente que le gusten los eurogames de Knizia y los juegos ultrasencillos, tanto en su mecánica como con sus reglas. Tiene un aire que recuerda a numerosos juegos, a pesar de su simplicidad, tales como al Go, Tigris, Samurai, Through the desert, Carolus Magnus, Masons, Can`t Stop... a primera vista no lo recomiendo.


MiniGenesis

Esta es la adaptación a papel y boli del juego Genesis http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/23981/genesis diseñado por Reiner Knizia. La adaptación sigue sus reglas al 100% pero tiene la posibilidad añadida de crear tableros variados.
Es un juego rápido para 2, 3 o 4 jugadores.

Componentes
Papel cuadriculado, boli azul, boli, rojo, boli negro, boli verde y 2 dados de 6 caras.

Preparación
Hay que dibujar sobre el papel cuadriculado el tablero de juego.
Para 2 jugadores el tablero se compone de 110 casillas, lo más normal es hacer un rectángulo de 10x11.
Para 3 o 4 jugadores el tablero se compone de 140 casillas, lo más normal es hacer un rectángulo de 10x14.
Dentro del tablero de juego, hay que tachar varias casillas. Dentro de estas casillas no se pueden dibujar nada durante la partidas y al tacharlos no pueden estar pegando a los bordes del tablero, los llamaremos abismos. Con 2 jugadores hay 18 abismos, con 3 o 4 jugadores hay 22 abismos. 
Cada jugador deberá escoger una sola letra: por ejemplo A, B, C... a estas letras las llamaremos especies.

Juego
El jugador que perdió la partida anterior dibuja el tablero y comienza el turno, si es la primera partida, un jugador dibuja el tablero y el otro comienza, esto se determina al azar.
El juego es por turnos y sigue en las agujas del reloj.
En el turno el jugador tira los dos dados. Los dados sirven para escoger los tipos de color de tinta con que escribiremos la especie nuestra este turno, al tipo de tinta le llamaremos terreno. Dependiendo del número de cada dado se mira la siguiente tabla:
1 = tinta azul.
2 = tinta roja.
3 = tinta negra.
4 = tinta verde.
5 o 6 = tinta a elegir.
Al tirar los dos dados, tendremos que dibujar en tablero, dependiendo si somos el jugador con la letra A, B..., hay que dibujar sobre una casilla vacía, las dos letras correspondientes a los dados según la tinta dada por los dados; por ejemplo: si soy el jugador B y tiro los dados y me sale un 1 y un 2, dibujare dos letras B una de color azul y otra roja.
Las letras no se pueden dibujar dentro de otras letras ni dentro de los abismos, pueden dibujarse en cualquier casilla vacía.
Se puede escoger dibujar UNA sola letra del color que quieras en vez de aplicar el resultado de los dados.
Después de dibujar se acaba el turno.

Objetivo
Cuando el juego avanza, el tablero se llenará de especies con terrenos en los 4 colores. Cada jugador intenta dominar estas áreas teniendo su letras unas al lado de otras, cosa que llamaremos manadas. Las manadas pueden ser de un solo cuadro o muchos conectados (es decir, adyacentes); las especies que tocan por las esquinas no están conectadas, deben tocarse por arriba, abajo, derecha o izquierda. Las especies que no están conectadas son manadas separadas.

Final del juego
El juego termina cuando en el tablero no hay un área que tenga más de tres cuadrados vacios conectados entre sí. Los jugadores cuentan entonces sus puntos en un papel, el jugador con más puntos gana.

Puntuación
Se puntúa de acuerdo a las siguientes reglas:
*Área de puntuación: Para que un área puntúe, debe contener al menos 3 casillas con 1 o varias especies. Por lo general, el tablero tendrá varias áreas de un mismo terreno. Estas áreas se puntúan por separado.
*Puntuación de manadas: Dentro de cada área, la mayor manada anota 4 puntos y la segunda mayor 2 puntos. Si un jugador tiene la primera y segunda mayor manada de un área, o es el único dentro de esa área, el jugador anota 6 puntos. Si dos o más jugadores empatan con la manada más grande, se dividen los 6 puntos (para el primero y segundo lugar) entre ellos, y el jugador con la segunda mayor manada no puntúa. Si hay una sola manada mayor, pero empatan por la segunda mayor manada, los jugadores empatados dividen los 2 puntos del segundo entre ellos. Todas las fracciones se redondean hacia abajo.
*Bono de puntuación: La mayor área del tablero puntúa triple (12 para el primero y 6 para la segunda mayor manada) y las áreas más grandes de los otros 3 terrenos puntúan el roble (8 para el primero y 4 para el segundo). Si hay empate por el área más grande, ninguna área puntúa el triple. Si hay empate entre áreas de un mismo terreno, ninguno de ellos puntúa el doble.
*Recomendación: Al anotar los puntos, primero determina el área más grande y se puntúa, luego se puntúa el resto de áreas de ese terreno. Después se puntúan las áreas de los otros 3 terrenos, siempre comenzando por el área más grande.

Regla opcional: Si has colocado al menos 13 casillas con tu especie de un mismo terreno, de aquí en adelante si te vuelve a tocar ese terreno puedes escoger el terreno que quieras en vez de ello.[/COLOR]

Take rating with grain of salt, as I'm not crazy about these types of games, unless there is more going on.  It's definitely clever, and there's more going on strategy-wise than you'd think from reading the rules, but it just didn't grab me.  Much too dry.  Much rather play other things.

RATING: 6
Ok game, didn't really do much for me though.  The main reason being is it is an area-influence game. I'm not a big fan of that genre.  Each player has 4 different color tiles.  You roll dice to determine what colors you can place on the board.  At end of game, you score points based on each contiguous set of "like-colored" tiles you own in an area.  A few twists on the scoring, but by and large, that is it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players represent a species of animal in Pangaea, battling for dominance.  Super-simple tile laying game - players roll two dice which indicate which of the four terrain types of tile they can lay on the gridded board.  Once an area of terrain is 3 tiles or larger, it will score at the end of the game.  Majorities of animal connected (herds) in an area of terrain will pay out victory points, with bonuses for the largest areas of each terrain.  Very easy game to learn, but full of the subtle Reiner touches.  Excellent tile laying game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels a lot like Through the Desert, particularly in that you want to do much more on your turn than you can, but with a small amount of luck to restrict perfect lookahead.  I think this is a great design, and if I were more of a fan of majority-control games I'd rate it higher.

[1 play] Hard to say why this one just didn't grab me.  Pretty neutral; I'd be willing to play again, and maybe it would become more interesting.  Very Knizia (and that's not necessarily a bad thing): mathy and lightly themed.  This just didn't give me the sense of urgency that I get from Blokus or Hey that's my fish.

A quickly paced tile laying game by Dr Knizia. Its not the best game in the world, but it does require a suitiable amount of strategy for players to walk away with the victory. Bought for £5 from Static at the UK Games Expo 2008.

Another elegant Knizia. Simple rules. Not a lot of bits. Lots of strategy and gameplay. Easy to teach, learn and have a go. I'm certain the more I play, the more strategies will become evident - and even more fun.

RATING: 6.5
Really nice area control game with nice quality tokens.
Dice aspect is different but luck is not a huge factor.
Scoring is a little complex and confusing for the first game however you can quickly pick it up.

The strategy of getting all of one piece type onto the board to allow for more choice i.e. that choice becomes wild when rolled if you have non left is quite powerful but it does leave you without a terrain type if it is needed later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not exactly an attractive game, and therefore not as inviting as many.  However it is a good family game with pretty simple rules, light strategy, and should be reasonably fast play.  I didn't like it with two--the scoring was just a hopscotch game.  Three was much better (it is just more interesting), and I suspect 4 would be even better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
A very tactical game of blocking (similar to Ingenious). I like the fact that this is an area majority game, but the 'areas' are created as the game plays. Players decide where the areas will be, how big they will be, and when a new area will come in and cut another one off. Reading the rules makes this sound like a simple little filler, but there really is much more here than meets the eye. Great game. Plays in 30 minutes or less too.

RATING: 9
After reading the rules I didn't have high hopes for this game, but it played much better than I anticipated.  I think it is a deeper game than it first appears. There are plenty of opportunities for blocking opponents. It is basially an area control game, which isn't usually my favorite.  I like that even if you don't want to fight it out for the larger areas with the other players, you can carve out a bunch of smaller areas.  The more I play this the more I like it.  There is a lot to think about for a quick(er) game with simple mechanics.

RATING: 8
Eleven face-to-face plays, thrice with two, five times with three and twice with four. It's a great little game--simple, fast and fun. Like many other Knizia games, a player's turn is quick but there's still stuff to think about; sometimes your turns are no-brainers, but there are also lots of opportunities for smart play. Well-timed blocks are key. 

There's also a lot of scope for different styles of play;  you can fight to dominate a few big herds or play more opportunistically, though you have to make sure you're not fighting too many battles at once. It's important to know what's on your opponents' plates as well; you can take advantage of someone who has too many irons in the fire, and conversely you should avoid picking fights with someone who is playing single-mindedly. 

There's also a nice flavoring of luck; for the most part, the range between a good roll and a bad roll is not that wide (it's nice to get doubles and wilds, but they're not necessarily going to win you the game), but occasionally there'll be moments when you'll desperately want one color or another, and in those moments the dice add a lot of excitement. The important thing, though, is that there's almost always something useful you can do with any old combo, so it's rare that there'll be a turn when you'll feel like you haven't been able to put your stamp on the board in some small way. 

Anyway, if you enjoy Knizia's "light but not quite" games like Ingenious, Through the Desert, High Society, Africa, and Marco Polo Expedition, you might want to check this one out too.

Played mostly with two players, but three may be the sweet spot. Very nice family game, with some subtleties and less luck than the presence of dice may suggest. In fact, the dice add just the right amount of randomness, limiting your choices each turn, but not too much, still leaving room for interesting decisions.

Get a bit of a ho-hum feeling from this. Find the scoring a bit convoluted and so makes it hard to xplain to people what they need to be doing. But maybe a few more plays will make it a bit easier to grasp.

A 2008 birthday present.  This is a simple tile-laying and area-majority game from Knizia that seems to be under the radar.  Very easy to teach and learn.  Each turn you just roll some dice and place a couple tiles.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a satisfying filler that plays in 45 minutes. Knizia always seems to present interesting dilemmas to players, and this is no exception. Although there is a random element in the dice to determine what kind of terrain tile you can lay, there are both strategic and tactical considerations presented by the fixed landscape of the board. Tiles are placed on a grid, but cannot be played on volcanos spaces that are scattered throughout the board. The volcanos pose as choke points, to contain the growth of specific herds, so there is a lot of blocking and preempting for position. In this regard, it feels like multiplayer chess, but the dice prevent it from being deterministic. It is more about creating opportunities, so that a player can exploit any kind of dice result. Neat little game that can easily be overlooked.

RATING: 7
This reminded me of an easier, shallower, faster Tigris and Euphrates, without the viciousness, monuments or clever scoring. I liked it, but the others thought it was mediocre. The core mechanism is very clever, and typical Knizia. All players lay brown, blue, green and white tiles, trying to get their own tiles into _herds_, while blocking other players herd formations. The board has obstacles to make it easier to block other players.If it was cheaper and if the components were better looking, I would definitely get it and rate it higher.

After a couple of plays, I quite like it.  The gameplay was a lot richer than I thought it would be from just reading the rules.  Interesting game of forming majorities and tactical tile placement.

Simple, fast, fun tile-laying area majority game that is almost the classic definition of an abstract strategy game but has the (downgraded) luck of the dice involved - and actually that's what makes it fun!

Fun game with lots of strategy.  I would probably consider buying it if it had better looking components or artwork.

I'm not sure the family would enjoy this much.

My instant reaction is a light family orientated mix of Through the Desert and Clans (without the scoring system of the latter) which works well with three players.

But from a critical approach to the game it does not appear to bring anything new to the table and to an extent plods along like the dinosaurs represented on some of the players tiles.  Knizia does enough to give a strong case for intelligent design.  The use of dice (amazingly without losing too much control) may give the game greater family appeal but for most gamers it will feel like a backward step from Through the Desert.

RATING: N/A
I think that Uptown may scratch the same itch as this game.

With other Knizia greats like Through the desert, Kingdoms and Knights of Charlamain (?) I'm not necessarily sure that this game would hit the table that much. 

Additionally, I think that the pictures of the animals look awfully similar and this would make it far more difficult to discern the difference and QUICKLY assess who has dominance in a particular color. Accordingly, it might end up taking longer to play or being prone to more AP than would otherwise be there. Ultimately, this could lead to unnecessary frustration.

Worth buying (just to have) for a few bucks, but not much more.

Images of 1 Million Years BC & a scantily clad Raquel Welsh soon evaporated, pity, that would have made for an interesting game. While getting Phil Collin's picture on the box art may also have made the game more thematic, the game itself was the usual abstract from Dr Knizia. 

Anyway, the game runs like a pre-cursor to E&T that Reiner had sitting in his cupboard & decided to publish. Get majorities in groups of colours, score more than everyone else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really good one along the lines of E&T and Ingenious.  I actually like this better than E&T for a simpler session or a newbie crowd.  The scoring is at the heart of it, and it helps to explain the scoring very well beforehand, as it looks really simplistic.  As with most Knizia games, it will take at least one play to get the basic mechanic, and many more plays to get the nuances and strategies.  A surprisingly good time.

Somewhat abstract majorities game where players role dice to determine which tiles they can place.  Congregating like tiles (yours and opponents) creates groups on the board and the 1st and 2nd place players in those groups receive VPs.  You also receive multiplier VPs for being 1st or 2nd amongst the largest groups on the board for each color.  Some good decisions to make.  Locking out opponents, protecting your groups, etc.  May be too easy to pick up easy points by creating lots of little groupings but perhaps that's part of the intended decisions to be made.  Seems like a game that would have come out 10 years earlier than it did.

Game is underated.  Played the *heck* out of it with some "light gamers" a few weekends ago, and really enjoyed it.  Takes one or two games to understand the kinds of strategies, but for the (few) individuals that complain about Tigris Euphrates' "luck" factor, this game solves that.  Chess like in the moves. . . quick & fun.  Kinda of reminded me the first few times I played Santiago - can't believe that the simplicity makes it that much of a game, but I like this a lot.

I've only played this with 2. I imagine that the scoring mechanism is much more interesting with 3 or 4 players therefore I reserve final judgment until I've had a chance to try the multiplayer version. This is another clever Knizia design that has just enough of a random factor to keep things interesting.

RATING: N/A
Another quality Knizia game. Anyone who likes abstract strategy games (who also likes euro games) would probably like this one.
The playing of the pieces and scoring is open (like go) but the dice adds an interesting twist to the game calling you to make decisions as to how best to use your roll.

The scoring is the most crucial part of the game and I wrote out a separate sheet to explain all the permutations of scoring the 1st and 2nd place herds.

Use the term territory to describe 3 or more connected terrain tiles of the same terrain type.

Herd to describe 1 or more of a single players connected tiles in the same terrain type.

Terrain type is the 4 different colors and it is helpful to use this term when explaining the scoring.

Has blocking aspects using 4 different colors. It plays multiplayer or quite well with just 2. A little dry so avoid if you don't like that sort of thing. A good tactical game.

RATING: N/A
More truly akin to Go than any of the other tile-layers from him [despite the much-repeated refrain of Through The Desert being "multiplayer Go"], in that it deals explicitly with the concept of liberties. This is so unlike the way the tile-/stone-/camel-placement works in any of his other games that it stands out.

I'd consider Through The Desert to be in the Hex family first. Samurai is very clearly [to me] Dots-and-Boxes. Tigris & Euphrates, Rheinlander, and Stephenson's Rocket are all Acquire derivatives. Ingenious is Dominoes meets Scrabble. He reaches furthest back [appropriate given the theme I guess], it seems, with this Go-ish title.

Essentially, the game is one of building up areas of like-colored tiles that you want to have the largest percentage ownership of. All of your tiles competing for that ownership have to be connected, however, which introduces the concept of liberty. An opponent can cut you off by laying a tile [of any color really] next to your growing group, nerfing your bid for control.

There are some other cute trade-offs. All of the regions score identically [4 pts for 1st, 2 for 2nd], so it behooves you to build as many separate regions as possible; the one exception is that the single largest group scores three times as much as any other, which keeps players fighting over large areas and fighting to make large areas and small.

Menuda joyita de Reiner Knizia. Juegazo tremendo, con muchísimo enfrentamiento por disputarse mayorías. Sentirás agobio al querer abarcar tanto y no poder. Las puntuaciones finales provocan que muchísimas veces no sepas en qué centrate, qué te será de más beneficio. Esa es una de sus grandezas.

RATING: 7
Sort of feels like a family weight version of Tigris and Euphrates meets Kingdom Builder. For that, I found it enjoyable. All you do is roll two dice and place tiles matching the land types on each die, or place one anywhere to ignore the dice. This feels like it should have been a SdJ nominee, in a lot of ways, but I almost wish that it moved along at a slightly faster pace. Otherwise I really like Genesis. It's a pretty underrated game that I could see working really well with families.

My favourite part of this game was the ending - when all four of us finished on exactly the same points - perhaps the perfect ending. But I'm still unsure about the game.

I would consider myself a fan of Knizia's non-euros-that-get-categorized-as-euros; this one might be my least favorite of his though; maybe because it's an abstract versus something from his tried-and-true auction wheelhouse. It's pretty short, simple, but not very fun. Having only played it 2-player, I can envision it being more fun with more.

I really enjoy playing this game! This couldn't be any simpler to play and the components are excellent. You have a bag full of tiles that you will play to the board. On your turn you roll 2 dice and the color terrain rolled is the colors of your tiles that you may play. You are trying to be in majority of each colored terrain by the end of the game. For any points to count though you have to have an area of at least three colored tiles and any players tiles can count towards the area scoring. Clever "Knizia" style scoring really make this game fun.

RATING: 7
Acquire and E&T wrapped up together and played at warp speed, all over in 30 minutes. That's what we like. You're playing tiles to create same coloured groups, trying to have the first or second largest contiguous herd in each group, the biggest groups in each colour double (or triple) scores. Turns are fast. Roll two dice to let you know which colours you can play each turn and lay two tiles. There are decisions each turn on whether to play offensively by adding to existing groups or creating new groups, or playing defensively to block other people's herd growth opportunities and ensure you'll score within a group. Best moves achieve both. Excellent luck/thought balance for the timeframe. There may be not a lot of depth to explore, but it's dead easy to teach and enjoyable to play.

A game in roughly the same caliber as Hacienda, perhaps a little lighter and shorter. It reminds me of Hacienda although the similarity is remote. It offers lots of situations for overt tactical and opportunistic plays. Knizia's elegant simplicity shows. It is entertaining and engaging and I think it takes under an hour to play. Review is after only one play, but one play is enough for this light game to form a firm opinion.

Nice combination of area control, using tile placement and set collection. Like many games you want to be 1st or 2nd so you collect the points.

Once past the minimum you need to score, there isn't much advantage to keep growing the same group only a one group from each set will score bonus points. A nice twist.

The turns are quick, many are a given, but occasionally you need to set of the next. You need to watch you opponents so you can take advantage if they attempt to do too much.

An impressive game, where there are nice tactical choices every turn, but not too much long term agonizing because the dice set your horizon. There is opportunity for informal allicances to grow a territory as well as back-stabbing and blocking. The rules are very simple - just one page, and there is a lovely elemental simplicity and elegance to the game. Marred by mixing dinos and people, and also by the artwork being a bit less clear than it could have been (different shaped amoeba or human artefacts) might have made sense and been easier to distinguish)

Best with 3; 2 is too computational and 4 doesn't work when there is no 3rd place reward.  With 3, it is clean and interesting.  The dice add some restrictions to the state space and make it viable to fight a region where you have a slight disadvantage, but there is very little luck.

Another Knizia game that is so clean and elegant it doesn't look like it should work.  But it works beautifully.  I don't know if it has the same replay value as his other classics, but I still look forward to my next play.

Another elegant Knizia design with tile laying and area control.  I like the twist of counting only your largest connected group of animals in an area instead of just all your animals as would be typical in such games.  Unusually, this uses dice to tell which color of tiles you can place each turn, but the randomness didn't seem annoying.  There some fun aha-insights about strategy and tactics in the first couple games I played.  I liked it, although when all the bits are thrown loose into the box, it takes as long to segregate them to set up for play as it does to play the damn game, which was annoying.

Takes Mexica's idea of area manipulation in an area control game and throws some dice in it.  Light, but not without many significant decisions.  Requires some planning, with tactical responsiveness.

A great little tile-laying area majority game, from Reiner Knizia.  I like it much more than Through The Desert (which I tired of).  Nicely produced, and very simple but elegant mechanics.  Very easy to pick up the rules (only a single page) and to play, and a pleasingly shortish playing time also.  More strategy to it than might first appear, notwithstanding the role of the dice.  Plays well from 2 players to 4, and often the final result will be closer or different than players were thinking.  I thoroughly enjoy playing 'Genesis' - it's one of my favourite games right now.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting, straightforward tile-laying area-control game. SHOULD play quickly, so please ... play it QUICKLY!! Nice filler with streamlined area control mechanisms. The main problem: it's sometimes difficult to distinguish different player's icons amongst all the other tiles in an area.

--- Summary ---
Players each play a different species. Each has a set of tiles in 4 colors (terrain). The board is a grid with volcanoes/tar pits scattered about. On your turn, roll 2d6 (2 wild faces, 1 for each terrain). Either ignore the dice and play 1 tile onto any empty space, or play 2 tiles matching the types rolled (if one tile type used up, may use any other type). The game ends when there are no groups of 3 empty orthogonally connected spaces. 

Then, determine the largest area on the board. That area scores 3x normal. Largest area in other 3 terrains score 2x. Other areas score normal. Note: only areas 3+ size score. Scoring based on HERD (=contiguous group of a player's tokens within a terrain) size. Largest area = 4VP, 2nd largest = 2VP. Ties for first -> divide 6VP evenly (round down). Ties for second -> divide 2VP evenly. Most VP wins.

Update (5-6-08): I've upgraded this to a '9'. In fact, it may overtake Through the Desert on my list of favorites -- it's that good. To those that complain about the luck of the dice, how different is that than pulling tiles from a bag? Also, there are two wild spots on each die, offering the chances for more flexibility. If you don't like your roll, you can disregard it and place one tile of any color you choose. Add all that to the fact that you can place the tiles on *any* empty spaces on the board. As has been pointed out in another thread, if you *didn't* have the dice, the decision tree would be almost unbearable.

Repeat: This is *not* a kiddie, dice-rolling game. This is serious business. 

==
Purchased at Game Parlor in Woodbridge, VA (4-1-08). One gets the feeling that this was an early version of Through the Dessert. In fact, it is very similar to that game -- if you can imagine it being played with dice. So, you're adding a moderate, but hardly overpowering, amount of luck to the game. Include the fact that "caravans" can include multiple players and can merge (not unlike Euphrat & Tigris) and you start to see how this game is a clever combination of both games. Considering that both of those are top ten games for me, it's not surprising to note that Genesis gets very high marks.

Update: In case I made it sound like Genesis is a lighter version of E&T, that's not really accurate. The similarities between Genesis and E&T are not as notable as the similarities between Genesis and TtD.

Half baked idea, like most of Knizia's games. "Bison: Thunder on the prairie" starts with a similar concept but builds a proper game out of it. This one is just not working.

A very abstract tile-laying game whose main virtue is that it is fairly short, doesn't bog down into analysis paralysis and moves along at a pretty good clip. The pace is aided by introduction of dice that dictate what color tiles may be played, which limits choices somewhat (necessary to prevent this from becoming a brain-burner) but obviously adds an element of luck. I'm not a huge fan of abstracts and don't feel compelled to add this one to the collection, but can certainly see myself playing it from time to time in the future.

RATING: 4
Genesis is frequently compared to Tigris & Euphrates and the comparison is valid.  Genesis is lighter, faster, and more tactical.  There are dice, which help to keep things moving.  In my mind, these are big benefits.  But the eruptions of conflict in T&E have been excised, and what remains is just as dry but far less emotionally engaging.  "T&E lite" is a great concept, but this attempt just doesn't arouse.  The end-game scoring is hilariously time-consuming.

tried it with two but even if most of the owners say it is not the best count of players i still liked it a lot. the islands are too big for just two explorers but so there is no much interaction but the way the available actions is chosen is very innovative. then my gf likes the tower too much

RATING: 5.5
For me, this is the worst representation of Feld as a designer. I realize it was his attempt to implement a cube tower and I suppose in that space, it did something original. But the rest of the game is mechanical nonsense and forgettable theming. My first play I faired very well due to clumsily finding a exceedingly high scoring path. It left me feeling unfulfilled. Who wants to win a game handily and have no idea why?

RATING: 8
Nice game. I bought it knowing that I like Stefan Feld's games and also that I like Queen's production quality.  I wasn't disappointed on either count.  It is a bit expensive and the box is huge (about the biggest I have apart from MBs Samurai Swords), but other than that it's first class.

A really nice way of using the dice tower though this can be very variable.  Sometimes you have to throw the cubes on gently and sometimes really go for it.  Cubes don't tend to come out when you want them to...but then that's partly the point.  As in all the best games of this type, you want to do more than you can.

It's pretty to look at, the boats part of the game makes you feel that there is a good theme and it last about the right length of time for a game of this type.

I found it more fun than something like Agricola or Caylus, whilst still having plenty of meat. I hope it catches on here like they did.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

A rather disappointing Feld title.  Our game saw a lot of cubes get stuck in the cube tower, leading to many turns with few actions and limited options.  This made it feel like I wasn't getting the full game experience.  The cube tower feels like a gimmick that doesn't make for a consistent experience, and the performance of the cube tower can make or break the game.  I wouldn't say the game was broken in my play, but it certainly didn't feel ideal, or even satisfying.

RATING: 7.93
My first Feld!  Enjoyable, if somewhat dry (for those who are overly concerned with theme).  

The cube tower is an interesting mechanic, though I found I prefer the behavior of the tower after flipping and rotating certain of its internal panels so that it would retain a greater number of cubes--this led to fewer action points per turn and generally a greater variety of choices per action, making the game feel a little tighter (fewer action points per turn means the game actually fits more comfortably into the planned five rounds--otherwise the game feels like it is over after about 3.5 rounds, with 1.5 rounds of additional meaningless actions thrown in).

Works pretty solidly as an introduction to strategic Euros for persons who have the mental capacity to flex a few more neurons than what is required by TTR.  Unfortunately, the game can take an annoyingly long time to set up (and take down), what with organizing all of the various building tiles, assembling the game board, etc.

The Feld that got away. I am a big fan of this designer and wish I had picked up Amerigo at Gen Con 2014 but it was a big year for him and I had already grabbed Bruges and Rialto around the same time. The use of a cube tower to draft actions sounds like an interesting twist in using that feature but just the fact that it is by Stefan Feld is enough for me to want to try it and probably own it one day.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 game with 4 players.

I really love the idea behind the cube tower, but I just hoped it would eat a bit more of the cubes, that we put in it! 
Too many cubes of the same kind runs directly through the tower...

In the end of fourth round it seems that all island spaces are more or less occupied, making the green and red actions in the fifth round obsolete.
In my game, the only thing I focused on in the fifth round was to make extra cannons, which then converted to gold, which then converted to vp's...

Another great Feld design!  This one doesn't have quite the choice paralysis of his recent designs.  Much like [b]Macao[/b] and hell...MOST of his designs, Feld does some inventive things with old conventions.  Here he breathes new life into the the cube tower and the rondel.  Otherwise, it's primarily a building game.  Very interesting choices throughout.  It is a little long (with 4 players), but it was never boring.

RATING: 7.5
+ The cube tower is undeniably interesting and makes for tough tactical choices; Variety in strategic paths make for good depth in the game.
- Some turns are boring because everyone is forced to do the same action (but those turns are usually pretty quick).

Abstract:
A conquering game by Stefan Feld which is all about a cube tower! Players explore islands of South America and build landscape tiles in tetris-style. Amerigo lasts over five rounds, seven turns each. The cube tower randomly reveals colored cubes which represents the possible actions.

Actions overview:
a) Blue: move ships to establish trading posts on islands
b) Black: add cannons to fight off pirates (who get stronger over time and cause players to loose points)
c) Red: acquire tetris tiles aka "planning" 
d) Green: build acquired tetris tiles and probably collect crops on islands with trading posts
e) Brown: move forward on the development track (unlocks progress tiles which grant special abilities)
f) Yellow: acquire production tiles (crop multipliers)
g) White: either move forward on the colored turn order track or do the action associated with the color on the current location of the turn order track
h) Pass: Take gold in relation to the current number of cubes

Pros:
+ Cube tower: memory effect, probability element (push your luck), tension, and a cool tactile element
+ Modular map: the game comes with a lot of map tiles (sometimes there are many small islands, sometimes there are only a few big islands)
+ Indirect player interaction where players race for everything: establishing trading posts, buying multiplier tiles, collecting crop tiles, completing islands with tetris tiles, blocking other players on an island
+ Acquiring tetris tiles before being able to place them requires planning ahead (potential analysis paralysis)
+ Two types of tetris tiles: expensive neutral tiles for big points or cheap village tiles for low points and blocking other players
+ Number of victory points for completing an island depends on the round (the earlier, the better) which gives players a reason to build early
+ Specializing by acquiring progress tiles or focusing on certain crops (engine building)
+ The turn order track has an additional function (gives a player more flexibility)
+ Plays extremely well with all player counts (the modular map scales in relation to the number of players)
+ Gold can be used to increase effectiveness of actions (provides more flexibility)
+ Great combination between efficiency, long-time planing (tetris tiles) and short-term planing (what is currently available)
+ Well written rules book
+ Easy to teach and to learn

Neutrals:
# Theme fits, but still quite abstract
# Artwork is okay, functional. The box cover looks cool
# Somehow sequential gameplay: most exploring is in the beginning, most building is at the end of the game
# Many different strategies but players must build tetris tiles at least (which score the most points)
# Players can block other player on a island by building own tetris tiles like a "wall"
# Luck is shared by all the players equally through the cube tower: determining the probability of certain cubes to show up
# Randomization by the different order of progress tiles and production tiles. Map tiles and crop tiles are randomly distributed each game.
# All tiles are used, there are no "new" elements each game
# Maintaining canons to fight pirates forces players to prevent loss of victory points (simple mechanic but some people find it just annoying)
# There is one nasty progress tile that increases the strength of the pirates for all other players
# The cube tower usually provides the action related to the current turn, sometimes players have only one choice (some people find this boring)
# The first player has a little advantage at the start of the game because "best" islands can be picked
# There is no hidden information
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Huge game box (however, comes with a nice insert for the cube tower)
- Fiddly: a lot of tiles
- Set-up takes some time
- People who do not prepare their turn lengthen the game dramatically
- No player aids

Thoughts:
Amerigo feels like Anno the computer game. What I like most is placing tetris tiles to complete an island which is always very satisfying. Amerigo is also a tense and competitive game: players race for everything which fits perfectly the theme of exploration and conquering "the new world".

Similar games:

There is little interaction (except for the race for some island spots) but there is a good number of interesting decisions in a game that should not last much more than 1 hour. In fact, the game should have been even a bit shorter. The board can be almost complete before the end of the last turn.

I want to really like Amerigo. It has a cube tower being used in a new way and a really cool, modular board. I especially like the nautical, exploration theme. But something about the strategy doesn't really have the pizazz I wish it had. The map, for one thing, hardly matters halfway through the game. Positions are grabbed, and then movement is sort of useless. 

Plus, it's got super stereotypical 'Stefan Feld' point salad tracks with little thematic weight or gameplay content behind them.

RATING: 7.5
A true Feld game. If you like his other games you will also like this. Gameplay is very familiar. As always the game has several different actions that you can take but there is a central mechanic that prevents you from using some of them. Here instead of drafting (Notre Dame), use of dice (Burgundy, Bora Bora), mancala (Trajan), or random action groups (In the Year of the Dragon) Mr Feld uses a cube tower. The tower dictates which actions are available each turn. There is also the pirate threat which is a common threat for all players like rats in Notre Dame or Rome Demands in Trajan.

The game flows fast and the rules are clear. Players are competing for the turn order, for map presence, goods tiles, technologies and other stuff.

Another game by Stefan Feld which feel the same as the previous ones. It's a good game, it bring a little bit of innovation (the dice tower and the mechanic around it) and for the rest there are a bunch of re-engineered mechanics from his previous games. 

The amount of components in the box feels overwhelming in the beginning, but after the setup everything falls into place and the game is straightforward especially for those who played more Feld games before. The game play is fairly quick, especially with two players and building a sound strategy is possible from the first turn of the first play.

- You would assume a game with a cube tower is always a great game. Here you have an exception. In a halfway of 4-player game I realised I was so badly blocked out of the game that there was no point to do anything. I generally don't mind if the game includes player elimination, especially if the play time is short. But this was worse. I wasn't eliminated. I was beaten and left to die!

Reminds me of a cross between Bruges and Castles of Burgundy. Enough opportunity to choose your strategy and plan, but still need to adapt and react to the cubes and your opponents. I enjoy the Tetris-style tile laying. The cube tower is just good fun.

Components quality is very good. Artwork and graphic design is functional and clear, if a tad plain (not a bad thing). The box is, unfortunately, unnecessarily gargantuan.

RATING: 6
This is a decent game that will definitely please dedicated Feld fans, but IMHO, Castles & Macao did most of these Feldian mechanics better. 

If I want to play with mechanics wrapped within mechanics, driven by tumbling cubes reaching ostensibly random results, all wrapped with the semblance of theme, I would prefer to play Castles or Macao.

Was initially put off by the double randomization of the number of actions and available actions but found that it actually worked pretty well. Only thing I don't like about the game is the all-or-nothing effect of the pirates, regardless of having just one-too-few or no cannons at all. Neat exploration game in Feld's usual style.

RATING: 8.5
By far the biggest Feld game out there. Why the big box? Well it does at least keep you from having to take that cube tower apart before and after every play. But that's beside the point. Amerigo is one of Feld's best. He takes a mechanism ( the cube tower ) and puts it to an entirely different use than in other games that call upon the same devise. Each turn cubes go in and cubes come out. What color cubes come out and how many determine what actions can be done. The cube tower is an excellent way to determine actions in a game like this where there are so many things you want to do to get the points you need to win the game but typically not enough time to get them in. Instead of relying on dice rolls like some of his other games you get the ability to do a variety of actions as the tower allows. Want to be able to build that last plot on your island to complete it and get the points? All you need is for one cube of that color (green) to come out and chances are you might get to do what you want even if the vast majority of the cubes that come out are for building cannons (black). This game can bring out the AP at times especially when you get to the "Tetris" portion of the game trying to fill out your islands with the building tiles. But that doesn't detract from the way the game plays and the playful mechanism of the cube tower.

The thing that I love about this game is the exploration element and development on the islands. It is a euro game where the board actually gets used.

There are some really fun decisions in this game where you have to decide whether to go with the majority or to zig when they zag instead.

RATING: 6.5
Opponents had played before.  I had immediate handicap not subscribing to large islands and not realising importance of placing ships far apart and for subsequent landing.  Reminded me of Settlers where starting positions have large influence on your chances of winning and is a particular trap for the unwary or inexperienced.  The action generating dice tower worked well, deciding number and types of actions available.  We stacked the seventh cube on the others of the same colour on the rondel for ease of identifying which resources were still in the tower.  Other player's blocking of my ability to play larger expensive settlements was painful, but due to inexperience.  Was expecting the islands and various tracks to be difficult to finish, but in the end finished brown and white tracks and all islands full.  Game would have benefitted from one fewer rounds, a bit like Castles of Burgundy as started to become repetitive and game ends with little left to do.  Less can be more.

Feld egyre kevésbé tud sajnos megújulni, egyre inkább önmagát ismétli.
Ezzel együtt ez is egy jó kis mix, mint az utóbbi néhány játéka is, de míg az első játékainál komoly késztetést éreztem a megvételre, az újak valamiért már nem kellenek.
Hogy konkrétumokat írjak: a központi ötlet itt is jó, és bár a torony a Shogunból való, itt teljesen más célra szolgál. Ránézésre a Trajan mancalája is beugorhat, de teljesen másról van szó. A lényeg, hogy a toronyból kieső színek hajthatók végre a 7 féle akcióból. A bajom az, hogy az akciók fele csak egy sávon való tologatás, viszonylag unalmas funkciókkal. Az ágyúzás kicsit olyan semmilyen... A fehér kocka érdekes ötlet, anélkül kiszámítható lenne a dolog, így is sokszor tutira lehet tudni, hogy 1-1 szín mondjuk 3-szor egymás után nem fog következni. A piros-zöld párosban semmi új. A hajózással az volt a gondunk, hogy a játék felénél már nem volt értelme, hisz elfogytak a házhelyek:) A fekete házikót súlytalannak érzem. Általánosságban túl sokszor van olyan, főleg a játék 2. felében, amikor túl egyértelmű a választás.
Összességében: aki szereti a Feldeket, annak ajánlom, de szerintem nem a legjobbjai közül való...

A doboz bazi nagy:) Szép fakkos... de mégiscsak túl nagy:)

Amerigo is the fourth game by Stefan Feld released in 2013. Not a bad year for Feld-fans... but Amerigo is probably the better and most feldian of the quartet.

The game lasts 5 rounds, with each round divided in 7 phases. At the beginning of each phase the corresponding cubes are thrown inside the Wallenstein tower and those that come out determine which types of actions are available (different colors) and how many action points can be spent on the chosen action (number of cubes of the most numerous color).

As in many Feld games, there's an action point salad, with many actions rewarding victory points. I like the way the designer reinvented the cube tower from another game and made it the engine behind another elegant, challenging, different game.

Just one minor (?) nitpick: it seems the islands become full by the end of the fourth round, so in the last one the red and green action seem to lose meaning. Perhaps just four rounds would've been a better choice for game lenght?

Anyway, another great game by this designer. Bravo, Stefan Feld!

Like La Isla this game has some quirks that are either charming and enhance the experience or rough edges depending on how you see it. I love the cube tower and I love how all the elements of the rondel? come together.  Like some other Feld games you need to do the work to get any real sense of the theme of the game but all the mechanisms come together pretty well.  Plays quickly and its a lot of fun.  At 4 the decisions are the most interesting although you are going to be getting a much longer game than with 2.  With rules explaination and new players this can be 2.5 hours inc set up and tear down although will get a lot quicker.  For the amount of game this is still a lot of fun.

First Play: 3 players all 1st timers. Rules were simple to explain and the game unfolds over the 7 phases enabling a stepped understanding of the game. Players soon diverted to doing their own things but the numerous options are a pleasure to experience. Thoroughly enjoyed by all of us, perhaps my favourite Feld game so far.

2nd Play: 4 players. Just as good. Some AP issues which should be removed when players become familiar with the options.

A 9 rating after first play. That's the first time I've rated a game so high out of the gate. It's not for everyone, but it is for me. First, love the cube tower. Once again, Feld has found a way to add interesting mechanics to add variation and equal randomization to a game, which for me, increases the replayability and likability of the game. Many mechanics are perfectly balanced together. You have exploration, area control, many tactical decisions based on the tower results, some strategic plays with combinations of progress, building races and locations and the use of money. Money is funny in that you never use it to buy anything...but extra actions. I'm hoping the my enjoyment increases over time.

My one complaint is that I agree with those who say that it is one round too long. After the fourth round concluded, that felt like a perfectly natural place to finish the game. During round 5 we had little stuff to do. Possibly a house rule is in order there.

Great game!  You will never have same game board twice and the cube tower really keeps you on your toes.  My only gripe is that the black and brown colors printed on the board look much too similar.  Overall, a very fun and challenging game with tons of replay value.

Very Feldian and, while I completely screwed up my first game, I can see more good here than other Feld 2013 games.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the cube tower, but it does limit the action and the strength of your action like many Felds (e.g. Macao).  I will play this more to see if it can last.

Well designed game. Unfortunately there is nothing in this game, that makes it better than a few dozen other Euro Games. This one is a mid weight game, it's not very complex and tactical in nature. You may have an overlaying strategy, but you plan on a turn-by-turn basis. The cube tower mechanic is interesting and fresh. Reminds me of Macao. All in all a really good game, but not good enough to hit the table at a regular basis.

I had fun whilst playing but I don't really find myself wanting to play that often.  And for a relatively light game, the setup time is long.

After more plays, the shine has worn off.  This is definitely a game of diminishing returns (for me); I have no desire to play it again. I'd rather play Trajan any day.

Update again: I hate this game.  It is turn order dependent crap.

So much better than Trajan or Bora Bora, both of which I found convoluted and too much like "point salad" games, something Stefan Feld is often accused of. Amerigo is much closer to Macao or Castles of Burgundy, games that both have interesting action selection mechanisms but refrain from adding too much details. Amerigo has what might become my favorite action selection mechanism of all Stefan Feld games, and combines it with a nice variable board and a spatial factor with the placement of differently shaped building tiles. I really like this game.

OK, so I am a big Feld, and I won, both of which probably coloured my thinking but first time out I liked this a lot. Plenty of choices, lots of ways to score points (some of which are more effective at certain times in the game) and even the addition of a cube tower without the agony that brings in Wallenstein. Well thought out with difficult decisions without suffering from the Bora Bora issue of giving too much choice. Certainly looking forward to playing this again.

Another winner by Feld, for me. I like the turns and how the cube tower work.  You can plan ahead some but all of a sudden, some opportunity might pop up because of the cubes and you take an unexpected turn.  Doesn't have much player intereaction BUT it has some and it isn't insignifigant.  The game looks great and I am looking forward to playing it again.  I was a little worried about some of the comments (even though it had good ratings) but my worries have been put to rest.  

Plays good from 2-4 players.

A doboz szépen beleillik a polcon a QG szabványos Big box szériájába, úgyhogy megvan a helye. A minősége a szokásos QG minőség és a témához illő hangulatot ad a grafika.
Kinyitás után nem szabály, hanem a kinyomó kartonok néznek farkasszemet a boldog tulajdonossal. Ezekből van is hét darab, úgyhogy lehet ezen kedvteléssel élni, aki szereti. A kinyomókarton alatt négy nyelven négy szabálykönyv, majd alatta egy műanyag tároló rekesz. A tároló rekeszekben a faalkatrészek egy toronyhoz szükséges építőelemek  vannak. A többi rekesz teljesen üres, hogy a kinyomkodott tokeneket és lapokat el lehessen helyezni. Itt nem kell vacakolni a torony hajtogatásával, mert elkészítve került a dobozba. A tokenek minősége is a szokásos QG, úgyhogy egy szavunk sem lehet. Szerencsére kártya nélküli játék, tehát védőre nem lesz szükség, de kapunk a dobozba nejlon tasakokat.
Játék:
1 játék után, 3 játékossal. Ez a játék úgy jó ahogy van, azaz jó lenne, ha a játék végéig is ki lehetne játszani az összes lehetőséget. Sajnos az utolsó körökre az akciók fele értelmetlenné válik és ezt nehezen emésztettem meg. Egyébként a hangulat és a játék tetszett. A megoldások is jók, bár én kihagytam volna az a tornyot és inkább valami dobókockás, zsákhúzós megoldást tettem volna bele. Félreértés ne essék tetszik a torony megoldás, de ezáltal olyan nagy doboz kellett a játéknak, hogy nehezen hordozható és feleslegesen foglalja a helyet. A Feld játékokkal mindig az a bajom, hogy nincs eléggé kiegyensúlyozva, de ez egy teljesen saját tapasztalat. Mindemellett kedveleme a játékait. Nagyon jó pont, hogy nincs benne kártya!

I was a little worried that the cube tower was going to outshine the game, but I really liked this game. The planning based on what action was coming up on the rondel but also knowing how many other cubes of that type were in the tower and might come out at some other point made for a lot of interesting decisions. I liked the exploring and building aspect as well as the resource collection and production. The progress tokens helped you build a path you could follow. A very good game. Our first play was a bit longer than I'd like. Hopefully it will get faster.

It's an interesting efficiency, race and set collection game.  The novel thing is that the actions you can take and the strength/power for the actions is determined by a cube tower (randomized).  There is some predictability since cubes fairly readily move through the tower so you usually start each phase with 7 possible cubes (action points) for each phase.  I enjoy the tension of the race to collect the various scoring items and multipliers (i.e., port/town spaces on the map, goods tiles and multiplier tiles).  The building tile placement (tetris pieces) add to player interaction since you can cut off other players and cover over portal/towns, but simultaneously you're limiting your scoring multiplier potential and bringing the island closer to completion which will cause island scoring, so there are trade-offs and turn angst.  The special ability tiles give you methods to bend the rules and mitigate some of the luck from the cube tower.  Overall, it's my favorite game with a cube tower, but I'm not sure it will get played frequently.

Cube action summary from snoozefest:   The number of action points equals the number of cubes of the color with the majority. Alternatively, collect gold coins = a third of the total number of cubes (round up). Actions may be supplemented by coins (each coin spent adds 1 AP).

Fully expecting to loath this game - but surprisingly good for a euro.

There is a theme, and the game play is interesting, the cube tower to throw a bit of chaos into the actions means you can't just work out the perfect strategy and then crank it to win, rather you have to adapt meaning there's a bit of variety to each game. Variable map helps there too.

Rating might go up (or down) with repeat plays!

** Update, more plays (others liking it has meant it's seen a fair bit of play), rating up a notch as I'm liking it. Not convinced it's worth bothering with the pirates though, unless there is nothing you can do with the action to get more VP.

RATING: 7.5
Amerigo is classic Feld with a cube tower thrown in for good measure.  Although many classify Feld games by their "point salad" nature, in which everything you do gets you points, I prefer to see Feld's driving theme to be the use of a Random or Semi-Random element to pare down a player's options.  Everything you do provides points because the designer is not assured that you will be able to do any specific thing.  The challenge, in all of these games, is to figure out how your specific set of options can maximize your points not just for this turn, but for the game.  Amerigo follows this design ethos to a tee, using the cube tower to constrain players' actions and simultaneously affect the value of those actions.  By itself, this would result in all players taking identical actions - which is hardly a game.  However, the board state offers enough variation that players often find themselves with different priorities.  

I find Amerigo to play fairly smoothly with short, bite sized turns that move quickly but nonetheless offer players the chance to work toward larger strategic goals.  The total playing time is 90-120 minutes, and the game does not overstay its welcome, although it is true that the islands can be fully built out before the start of the last round, in which case players don't have much to do.  Amerigo is a bit fiddly, with a number of small rules and exceptions, but these are not overwhelming.  

Overall, I highly recommend Amerigo to those who like Feld games.  This is a good medium weight title that gives players a lot of options of how to proceed, but then winnows down the number of viable options to something you can get your head around.  It should be noted that this is a pure Euro experience, with little player interaction (some conflict for the best spots on the map, but not much else).  Also, there is clearly a fairly heavy random element in the game that forces more tactical thinking.  Those who prefer games with more control may be frustrated here.

This design is brilliant. The available actions for each phase are almost always interesting and tense, thanks to the drop of available cubes into the cube tower each phase. Strategy and tactics are capably united for a most satisfying game play. The game ends at just the right time, when the buildings on islands are starting to max out. Excellent design, and excellent exploration game! Completely different from Francis Drake, yet just as satisfying.

Another Feld game that was a hit with us. It's very simple, with an almost gateway-level rule set, but you usually have some tough choices on every turn. (I reversed the B side of my cube tower to retain more cubes: the end result was that about 1/3 of all cubes are retained, which made the game a little more interesting and unpredictable.) People who compare this to Trajan or Bora Bora miss the point: this is not a heavy "gamer's game," and was likely intended for a broader audience. 

You really have only one objective: settle the islands quickly and efficiently. Every decision you make is centered around this simple, single goal. The interesting choices come in with the push-your-luck nature of the cube tower. You may want to do X, but if it's an X round, and choosing Y would score you some easy points or enable you to improve your board position, you could risk skipping X and hope it will become available during the next cube drop. As in so many Feld games, the trick to playing the game comes in simultaneously 1) planning an efficient and logical sequence of actions while 2) managing risk to try and pull those actions off better/faster than other players.

I enjoyed playing this and would like to get it to the table again soon. The tower is a little loose for my taste, I flipped the one piece and that seemed to help.

Essen 2013. Gigantic box with one of the best fitting/well designed inserts I've ever seen; well done Queen. And it is stuffed with enough cubes, tiles and counters to provide enough moving parts to make this a good gamers' game - there are usually a few enticing options available each turn, though not normally to a brain-burning extent, making for difficult choices without slowing the game down too much - which is a good balance to strike. The 'piece de resistance' though, from both a component and a design perspective, is the cube-tower - sturdily well built (enhanced by the wonderful box insert, which allows it to be put away safely without disassembly) it drives the game in a genuinely innovative way, providing a 'variable action' - and action point - rondel in a way which enables you to be pretty certain about the minimum actions you'll get next turn and enough info to guess what the possibilities might be for the next couple of turns, but no certainty. I think the result is therefore more tactical than strategic but it presents a fascinating set of tactical choices. It may even improve with more plays; I'd certainly like to find out.  And what a joy to be able to play a game of this length and complexity with barely a reference to the rules and - just as importantly - knowing where to find the few things we did need to look up; credit again to Queen, and to Rahdo, whose run through we all used to get up to speed with the rules.

As is usual for Feld games as of late, Amerigo is another in the line of "point salad" games that most people will either love or hate.  However, the parts of the design are much more integrated here than in most of his similar designs.  In many Feld games, I feel like I'm playing a bunch of mini-games, but here, many of the various actions interact in some way, which I enjoyed.

However, actions aside, the action selection method used here is genius, and is a very clever use of Queen's patented cube tower.  Really awesome idea, and it works extremely well as an action selection method that is predictable enough, but also unpredictable enough as to make things interesting!

Overall, definitely one of my favorite of Feld's designs.  However, I tend to enjoy them all, so it's no surprise I liked this one!

I’m not a huge fan of Feld’s games. It’s not like they are really bad, because they aren’t, but they also aren’t very good (except for a few like Castles of Burgundy). Amerigo is no exception, although I think it’s much closer to falling into the “really bad” area… There are several reasons for this, but they two main reasons are that it’s too long and that the cuber tower doesn’t work.

Now, it’s not “too long” in the sense that it takes hours to play. It takes about 90 minutes or so. But it’s too long because I would dare say that the two last rounds, or at least the last round, could easily be totally left out, and that the game would be better if doing so. The reason is that a lot of the different actions aren’t useful at this point in the game. It’s not just something I experienced in all of my own games, I’ve also heard it from other people. For instance we didn’t use the sailing action halfway through the games as we had already colonized most of the islands with trading posts, so other actions would grant more points. Or in the last round we had built all of our buildings on the islands, which again meant that the green and red actions were useless… And most of the special chits which grant you bonuses throughout the game were also useless. Honestly, to me, that’s a somewhat sloppy game design… 

Also, the cube tower. It doesn’t work in the way I (and many others!) think it “should”; it often spits out too many actions/cubes, and often only in the color you just threw into the tower… This makes for a pretty boring game when you don’t have a bunch of different actions to choose from. Yes, you can grab some coins, but that’s honestly not that effective…
It also felt a little weird that you would get an extreme amount of points if you’re completing the islands asap; for instance 15 points in the first round vs. 3 to do it in the last round if it’s an island with just 2 trading posts, and the problem is even more exposed with more trading posts. I know it’s a balance issue, but it didn’t feel very balanced to me (Burgundy is a good example of a game which manages to do it in a good way).

What I do like about Amerigo, and the reason why I wouldn’t totally object to play it again, is that while you’re doing your own thing, you still need to see what the others are doing, need to watch out for turn order and the fact that you can block the other players when building. The building aspect is a great thing about the game; I’m always a sucker for spatial elements in games, and when you can block your opponents by doing so, I’m thrilled! However, in the end, the negatives outweigh the positives. It’s a classic Feld point salad game in which you get points for doing everything, so you’re never quite sure if¬¬¬ you played well or what you did that made you win the game… To be honest, this game is more like a shit sandwich than a point salad.

Ok game, a mix of different actions, with a dice tower as game engine. At the end of the game, some actions become less useful or even useless (shipping!) A lighter game, in which it is quite easy to achieve everything you wanted to.

The dice tower is used in this one to determine what actions are available and how powerful. For the most part (3/4 of the time) the right move is obvious, which is not interesting. The actions are buy buildings, build, move ships, turn order, get special powers, get points, or get cannons. The cannons are just a resource to manage to avoid losing points like food is in Agricola. The other thing I don't like is that you race to settle on islands and the people who don't get there are locked out, which is a downer that limits your options at the end of the game. On the plus side, the random map is cool and the dice tower is neat, even if its under-developed.

Only one play, but feels very unfinished with cube tower serving very little purpose (you can tell it was added to the game at the behest of Queen as opposed to being designed that way).  Initial positioning of your ships can have a significant impact.  I wish the tower played a larger part in the game than it ended up doing.

Overall, I think there are lot of other Feld games that are lot better.  This one feels unfinished.

The theme makes sense.  The mechanics are solid.  Filling the islands with Tetris pieces is moronic and makes this game partly unenjoyable for me.  The design & build phases are fantastic ideas, but those damn Tetris pieces make them the worst part of this game.  And it's a huge part.  I will not play this game again.  

For a Queen game, the components are shit.  The player boards are really poor quality.  The ridiculous number of same-sized chits used for goods and their multipliers was poorly designed.  Dials or cubes or anything else but those tiny, non finger-friendly chits would be better suited here.  Both the "cardboard" stock and plastic parts of the cube tower are extremely flimsy and low quality.  The size of the box is extremely misleading.  Box size does NOT equal quality.

Also, it's broken/solved.  Pumped out 8 settlements in the first round on islands that others were likely to complete, maxed my tech track by the end of round 2, got cannons when needed, only built twice on the big island getting 2 goods multipliers each time, got the bonus that lets you get 1 gold for 2 cubes, maxed my gold & kept taking the vp bonus points each time I got gold.  And that strategy was gold indeed.  It's how to win this awful game.

Gives players a little more concrete direction than other recent Felds such as Bora Bora. That's a good thing. I like the random map giving the game a strong spatial element. But there does seem to be a lot of "yeah, I too will do the same thing" each turn as the same options are presented to everyone, often with the same benefit/rewards to all players.

RATING: 4
Gimmicky and constructed, although not as messy as other titles of Feld with which Amerigo shares characteristics (Bora Bora, for example). The action structure is clear, and the dice tower more or less allows the players to select their own pattern of actions themselves instead of ramming them down their throats. Still, this is a not a game which needed to be created. The dice tower only contrains action choice for no other reason that it can; there is no skill in this restraining or having the players worming or planning their way in a clever manner out of this trap (like for example found in Trajan). The rest of the game is forgettable material without redeeming qualities.

I'm very much afraid that publishers are so desperate to publish anything related to Feld that they don't allow designs to ripen to perfection. The latest offspring continuously feel more and more half-baked, and Amerigo is no exception. Make no mistake, Amerigo's not truly [i]bad[/i], and many designers would give their left nut for a title like this for their own... but it doesn't grab you by the balls (or ovaries) and drag you along while you frantically try to navigate the turbulent waters. For a big box Feld, it is all very tame material, very laundered, without a hook that draws you in.

I like the cube tower, but I experienced issues with the tower flushing all of the cubes from round 3 onwards which meant we had a lot of turns with huge numbers of actions and very few choices. I've taken steps to improve the tower, and I want to test again before making a final rating.

What an odd combination of action selection, tetris like tile placement, ship movement and wooden cube throwing.  For some reason this works for me.  

I have found that on the last turn I sometimes run out of things to do and I dont like that.  Either too many cubes are coming out of the tower or the game should be one round shorter.  I have fliped the A and B tile in the tower a few times and I think that helped some.

2-4 player, best with 4, medium heavy, Stefan Feld, 90-120 minutes

Rating based on 3 plays with 2-4 players, which was very entertaining. I tend to like Stefan Feld's designs and this one is no different. The cube tower is a unique feature, which works very well.

The map scales well for the number of players, although the game really shines with 4. Although the games takes up quite a bit of shelf space, this is a keeper in my collection.

Amerigo has a couple good things going for it.  
It has the cube tower, which works well in this game.  I like the way it works with the action point allowances.  In our game there were not many times when players chose different actions, which I hope is not the norm.  That is needed to drive variability and keep things unpredictable.
I also like how there is competition for landing sites, but the movement is too restrictive to make this very interesting after the first few turns of the game.
Overall...good friendly competition, good scoring, and a solid game.

RATING: 7.5
An excellent and unique action selection game using the infamous cube tower from Shogun. It took me a while to get the cadence of the game but now I really appreciate it's simplicity. The exploration theme is nicely incorporated and it is typical Feld, tight, and you are often pausing to calculate point per move (although sometimes the point differential is not very great). nice, slick game I look forward to playing again soon.

Not the cleanest of Feld's games, but fun enough. A little too much luck inolved than what I typically care for in a game of this length. Spacial aspect (building settlements on the islands) is uninteresting. The action cubes are a fun mechanic, as is the technology track. End game was less exciting, as a lot of the actions seemed worthless, and players took gold instead. 

End game was more interesting in subsequent plays, thankfully.

This game is unusual in that it is a map-based game where I really enjoy the map and the interaction on the map. The opportunities to block other players by competing for ports or by blocking off portions of an island provide great fun and interaction.

I think 4 players may not be so great for this game. We enjoyed it much better as just a 2-player game.

Also, the cube tower can be somewhat problematic. As assembled, it seems to hold onto very few cubes... but when we flipped over the B baffle (as suggested on the BGG forums), we ended up very often with only 3 or 4 cubes coming out. So, we're still trying to figure out how to get a good distribution from the tower... it seems like 2-3 colors should be coming out each time, with an average of 4 or 5 of the "main" color for that turn.

Lastly, setup and takedown is very significant considering the game isn't very heavy at all. (And the box is waaaay too big, though that's not a big deal.)

Amerigo is een spel van Stefan Feld. Dit spel zal dus goed verkopen, al is het alleen maar omdat de naam van Feld op de doos staat. Feld is één van de Goden uit de spellenwereld. Mijn God is het (nog) niet. Ik speelde reeds Het Koopmanshuis (eerste indruk was fantastisch, tweede indruk was goed zonder meer) en Im Jahr des Drachen (pfff, ik heb nog nachtmerries als ik terugdenk aan dat spel). Zijn andere hits zoals Bora Bora, Brugge, Die Burgen von Burgund, Macao, Notre Dame en Trajan heb ik nog niet kunnen spelen. Ik kan dus nog niet goed zeggen of ik al dan niet een Feld-fan ben.

Great use of the cube tower.  I like that all players at once are awaiting the outcome of the throw, all for (possibly) different reasons.  I also really like that you can see the probability on the board, and make estimates of how likely a cube is to come out.  The theme is also great, and does feel a bit like exploring and colonizing.  Excellent game.  Plays a bit too long with 4, probably even better as a 3 player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really good game.  I love the use of the cube tower to determine how many actions of which types you can do.  That was great.  And I really liked the ability to upgrade the various aspects of the player mat.  The only real bummer of the game was the sailing around the board which only seemed interesting at the beginning of the game.  Once ports got made and there were plenty of places to build, that action died off quickly.  I wish there was more to do at that point.  I guess I was also not thrilled with the random pirate attacks, even though I understand them.  But if you get the 4 chip to come up in the second or third round things can really escalate quickly, and if you haven't prepared for it that can ruin your game.  Those quibbles aside, I suspect my rating for this could go up even higher on further plays.  Time will tell.

I think i start to understand how Feld's games work. Theme is not strong - however mechanically it is neat. Only disadvantage of his games is setup time. You always have to change the tokens ... tons of them :)
Amerigo is a nice game, giving opportunity to plan and calculate your strategy. Randomization via tower is amazing (I just love the tower - it gives +1 to the game. With dice it would have not been the same - even though I love dice as well).  It is definitely good game.

Played once with a borrrowed copy. Plays smooth. The action selection mechanism keeps a complicated game from being overwhelming. However, players can suffered a little bit from group think and occasional lack of interesting decisions on some turns. Sure, getting the gold as a consolation action is nice, but it doesn't "feel" as valuable as getting workers feels in Castles of Burgundy.

Second play was more of the same. Just not very fun for us. Very disappointing. Too many turns with no interesting decisions.

I have to say I enjoy this game while a lot of my friends aren't as keen so it doesn't get much table time which IMO is a real shame.

It's a beautifully made game and there are some decisions to be made in order to get good victory points at the end of the game, the cube tower makes for a neat and different little mechanic too - when it behaves itself. 

Perhaps a little too reliant on luck when the cubes are drawn, but its the strategy of what to do with them for the best that I really enjoy.

Very disappointed as how the tower works. It should give you random choices, but in fact it's not the case. Round one, 4 blue cubes, 1 black, 1 brown. Everyone does the blue action. Round two, 5 black, 1 blue, 1 red, so everyone does the black action, Round three, 6 red, 2 green, 1 yellow, guess what? everyone does the red action... :(

Edit: we played wrongly the rules, after playing with the good rules I changed the rating

I like this more every time I play it.  The islands being different every time can really change the game.  And to be honest the cube tower is just awesome.

While the inclusion of the cube tower feels a little forced (obviously Queen wanted to leverage their tooling investment), the game works pretty smoothly.   I liked the island exploration and gridding off the best (a little spatial puzzle element, and some blocking too).   The tech and people tracks are a bit dull, but still important to doing well.   A little long, a little clunky, but a decent Feld game which is engaging and fun to play.

RATING: 4
If you don't grab ports as quickly and diversely as everyone else at the beginning (which can be hard with your ships too far away), you'll spend the next 70% of the game with fewer options than everyone else. The tension is then nearly all in the turn order, which you can only adjust sometimes. The tower action point randomization is fine with me and actually fun, but the ports and the way turn order works are not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is one of the most underrated games I have ever played. The cube tower gives it a very unique feel and provides great balance between intended strategy and the surprise element. I have seen a number of reviews where people seemed to imply that the game is nothing more than a point salad, but that's a gross exaggeration. There is a lot of depth and variety here.

Dice tower seems to not working well for the purpose of the game. 
Moreover, I think something much more simpler (and smaller) could achieve desirable effect better.

RATING: 7
Feld's fourth of Thirteen.   And the weakest by a fair way.  Let's compare them.  Equal first are the other three: Bora Bora, Rialto and Bruges.  The latter, Bruges, started off with me as relatively weak but I was playing some rules wrong.  Now I see all three as 8 or 9s. Time will tell whether 8 or 9 but certainly no lower.  All 3 are completely different in terms of complexity, mechanism, theme and strategy.  They are all my Top 3 games of 2013.

And what of Amerigo?  Disappointing.  If it wasn't for the cube tower I would possibly not play it again.  What's the problem?  
1. Overlong. 2 hours plus.  And the fifth round often lacks choices as you can be getting maxed out on the scoring areas. 2hours+ is not a problem with Bora Bora as the game evolves to a climax.  Whereas Amerigo peters out.

2. AP prone will get stuck.  Lots to think about. Which action shall I take is one main question, and you can't decide what you are going to do until the cube tower tells you which options are open to you.

3.  Tetris-style piece fitting is fiddly and requires some people to sit at the table playing with geometry on the board as they work out what is  the optimum shape distribution for their island.

4. For a Feld the scoring is a bit disappointing, especially the rather blunt production multiplied by plantations scoring.

There is no doubt that the cube tower is great and it really creates the fun in this game: not knowing what you might be able to achieve and cheering on the colour you want to be  emitted from the tower is a delight.  And for that reason alone I will come back to Amerigo to see if it improves on further plays.

But let's not get complaining here, Feld is definitely a man on fire and I await with excitement whatever he will next come through with.  Three of my top three of the year designed by the same bloke is pretty incredible.

Another great feld. I was kind of hesitant before purchasing this as a gift for a family member (also knowing that I would have easy access to play this when I want is a good thing). But I am so glad that I did buy it.

A fun exploratory and proper planning game with what limited options you can do. And such a fun new concept to be able to take turns with a tower where cubes go through and you play what comes out.

Can't wait to play again.

Essen 2013-as játék, karácsonyra meg is lett, és most -még csak április :-)- sikerült kipróbálnom.
Tetszett.
Jó mechanizmus, ötletes kockatorony, jól összerakott kártyák, megfelelő mennyiségű változatos elem, sokszor újrajátszható, és döntési kényszerek.
Itt részletesebben leírva a mechanizmus magyarul: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/162051/item/2896316#item2896316
Ezért ezt nem vesézném nagyon. Ami a lényeg: különböző színű kockák, minden akciótípushoz egy adott szín tartozik, és mindegyikből 7 kocka van. 5 forduló, a fordulón belül minden akció egy-egy fázis, ahol is bedobjuk az adott akció kockáit a kockatoronyba, és onnan kiesik jó pár kocka. Nyilván  bent is marad kocka, és nyilván kieshet olyan színű is, ami eddig bent volt. A kiesett színek határozzák meg milyen akciókat választhatunk az adott fázisban, és az egy színből legtöbb, h mennyi akciópontunk lesz a fázis akciójára. Minden fázisban mindenki végrehajtja az általa választott akciót. Az adott fázisban az adott szín akciójának van a legtöbb esélye: annak a kockái kerülnek bedobásra, többnyire ez határozza meg, hogy mennyi akciópont lesz. És aztán a kiesett színek az akciókat. Az akciók jól szétválasztottak, és tematikusak, hajózás -szigetek felfedezése- , épület tervezés, épület építés,  stb. Pontok sok mindenből szerezhetőek. A játék közben a szigetek első felfedezője kap, az építéskor az adott épülete építő, és egy sziget befejezésekor a szigeten lévő minden játékos, a sziget befejező bónuszt. A szigeteken nem csak építés folyik, hanem áruszerzés is, ami a játék végén hozhat sok-sok pontot, pláne, ha a termelésakcióval komolyabb szorzókat szerez hozzá a játékos. Na és ne felejtsük: a fordulók végén kalózok jönnek, amire fel kell készülni vagy sok mínusz pont. (ágyúakció). És van spec akció is, ami játékossorrendet változtat vagy épp az adott helyen lévő akciót lehet végrehajtani. Nekem nagyon tetszett. Egy hátránya az volt, h a játék nem 4 fordulós, hanem 5, mivel én én elszámoltam a fordulókat, és azt hittem vége  a játéknak -akkor még jól álltam, de miután kiderült van még 1 forduló, kissé visszaestem :-)

2014-03-23 : Mechanically a fine game, but the abstract board detracts from the game. A map of the Caribean would have been much better.

Amerigo offers some great choices with the action cubes. You may start off in lock step with each other but pretty soon players start stepping out of synch with one another and then some wonderful choices open up. You can press your luck a bit by negating an obvious choice, say taking 5 cannons, in order to snatch something up, say a Progress Card, and then hope you can get your cannons later in the round. 

Finding your moments to step out of sequence with other players is a consideration that gets more and interesting as the game goes on especially when you consider how to manipulate the turn order track for additional action options. Once players get some bonus tiles, there’s even more leeway for diverging from one another, and I quite enjoy the urge to do something creative each turn instead of taking the obvious action choice the cubes present.

I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed this one. The action mechanic is really interesting however towards the end of the game, in particular, the majority of the cubes thrown into the tower come straight back out which is a shame. 

Variable board and randomness from the dicetower mechanic mean there is a lot of re-playability here and the multiple ways to score victory points means there are several different paths to victory to explore.

RATING: 3
It's like nearly all his other games, a shambling mish-mash that barely functions as a game. The only part I thought novel was the use of the cubes after they came out of the tower, that is 5 blue 2 red 1 green meant you could do 5 actions of blue or 5 red or 5 green or take 2 money (8/3). Everything else in the game was bleedin obvious. Optimal choices were obvious, other players' moves were obvious, best contingency plan was obvious. 

He just throws so much in, everything ends up being adjusted and adjusted, there's no actual game left. I won by one point, 166 to 165! We both scored over 150 points and it finished on 1 difference. What were the other 150 for??

So the Feld fans will love it. The COTN will try it. Me, I think he's a passing fad. Emporer's clothes. His only good fun game so far is Roma 2. Everything else came out of a sausage factory.

Most unique part of the game is how actions are determined.  There are 7 different colored cubes each representing a different action.  Which actions available are determined by the colors of cubes that fall from a dice tower.  You can only choose one type of action but the number of points for that action are awarded by the greatest number of cubes in a single color.  For instance if 1 red cube and 5 blue cubes fall, then you may choose either 5 red actions or 5 blue actions.  

Player order also has a twist.  The person furthest ahead on a track is first.  However the track has 6 different colored stops.  When a white cube (wild) drops you can substitute the action of the colored stop you are on.  

The tower does make actions random which some people do not like.  However, because only one color is added to the tower at time followed by actions, you can usually count on more of that color falling through.  

Randomness of tiles makes the game refreshing each time.

While there are chits and bits everywhere, this game was better than I expected. Our cube tower was a bit too predictable though - it spat out the colour we put in, with a few of the other cubes as well.

One of the biggest game boxes I own unfortunately, but that is just about its only downside. As is usual with Feld games this is a collection of different mechanisms that work together beautifully.

The cube tower is what really makes this game shine. you don't have complete information about what actions you might be able to take on future turns but you can make an educated guess or try to push your luck.

This makes it a very tactical game as you can't plan everything out too far ahead. Really love it, one of Felds best games.

Another great Feld game (if you like Feld) that reminds me more of Trajan in feel than anything else.  There are two very cool components in this game. 1) The cube tower may be a disappointment to those familiar with the Wallenstein tower only because the outcome of each cube dump feels less important and interactive, but it can have a huge bearing on how each round plays out. 2) The fairly large map board will be set up differently each time, creating many sets of large and small islands, and knowing where to sail and settle on the map can be very significant.  Like most Feld games, there are many ways to score points, but not all ways are created equal for all players.  This was my favorite game of the BGG.CON 2013 convention.

Jó játék. Szerencsére Nem olyan lelketlen pontvadászat, mint a legtöbb Feld, így feleslegesen féltem tőle. Elsőre rövidebbnek tűnik, mint amilyen végül lesz, de szórakoztató látni, ahogy épül az új világ. A kockatornyos megoldás is ügyesen szűkíti az akciólehetőségeket. Persze van hogy valakinek jobban rosszabbul jön ki, de nincs olyan, hogy ne tudnál semmit se csinálni. Az építgetésnél van némi fájdalmas kiszorítósdi, amit az első játéknál csúnyán beszívtam, de legalább nem szoliter a játék. A következőkben jobban fogok majd figyelni erre. :)

Azért pár játék után érzem azt, amiért mások fújnak a játékra, azaz, hogy néha elég döntés nélküli tud lenni a játékmenet. Ez engem annyira nem zavar, mert van egy-két kulcsforduló, amikor cserébe nagyon fontos döntéseket kell hozni, de azért néha kicsit tényleg be tud szürkülni a dolog.

Amerigo is a fairly typical recent Feld "point salad" with lots of little actions that give lots of little victory points, however, it does seem to be a little more cohesive than many of his other games, ie. most of the actions are actually connected in some way instead of representing entirely disjoint subgames.

The rest is about what you would expect: A game of exploration and colonizing built around the action selection mechanism. The cube tower works pretty well as a mostly yet not entirely predictable action randomizer. So if you liked what Macao or Castles of Burgundy or Trajan did but prefer the tower to dice or mancala then this might be the game for you. Personally, I think this is one of Feld's less aggravating recent productions.

A big box game with the cube tower that randomisers actions.  A really nice game, probably the favourite Stefan Feld I have played.  Lots of thinking of lots of directions to take whilst worrying about turn order, and probably needs lots of play to understand the best way to play.  Theme is quite nice, at as a sign of a good game, encourages talking about what happened at the end (Rating 8.462, Feb 18)

November 2013 - Games have arrived. Great game, I really enjoyed the first play. Probably the best Feld released this year!

June 2013 - Queen games have decided to allow international shipping on this Kickstarter game. As such I have removed my '1' rating. My initial ranking achieved what it set out to do, which was to change Queen games position.

I will rate the game once it arrives and I have played it, as I have with around 500 other games. So for all those bleeding hearts who rated the game a '10' in response, its time to take a good hard look at yourselves.

I like this game, but I'm starting to think that the way the cube tower works is problematical. It is only semi-random in that some cubes can essentially get "stuck" for the entire game. In the other games that use the tower this isn't really a problem, but in this one it could be.

Large box but nice production quality and great insert, even includes enough bags to divide parts accordingly.

Cube tower worked as advertised and isn't just a novelty.  Provides excitement with each drop and a mitigated amount of chaos which works well in this game.  The boards and actions work together seamlessly.

This game feels thematic but can be optimized as any well developed and balanced game can be.

If you like Castles of Burgundy, Bruges, Bora Bora, etc.
then this is one you will like.

Another good Feld game, probably a bit more random than others, but similar mix of paths to take.  Modular board looks like it will be good for variety. I really like how the tower determines what action are available, and the extent they can do each turn - great use of the tower mechanic. Some turns are straightforward, others need some decisions. Enjoyable.

I love the feel of this game. It is fun to explore the islands and build village tiles. I also enjoy the resource scoring mechanism, balancing production spaces and resources. 

The tower is an interesting action selection mechanism. It can feel out of balance at times, sending the majority of cubes dropped in back out. Sometimes it gives very few options. But overall, I like the unique feel.

A game where editors and author have avoided making mistakes. However does this
guarantee that you have an outstanding game? Well, no.
It is a solid actionpoint driven game with a pasted on theme, as the mechanics remain abstract. They are at least easy to grasp. It seems good scaleable to different amount of players without too much downtime. The dice tower as mechanism to determine the available actions is new but does not offer a whole new game experience. As the actions are available in the same strength for all players, the game may be considered family friendly. You only have interaction in who discovers an island first or who buys a good or deveIopment first. We sometimes had the odd situation that only one cube dropped out of the tower, what means that all four players did choose the same action. I liked my first game and was neither over- nor underwhelmed.  Still I like Bora Bora more than Amerigo. I didn´t like the pirate rule. If you beat them, it´s all ok. But it makes no difference in losing victory points if you have one cannon less than the pirates or not a single cannon at all. There should be a difference. People who don´t like really big boxes should avoid Amerigo, it easy takes up the space of two average boxes.
If I didn't know already hundreds of games, I'd rate it higher. Furthermore I found that too many cubes are dropping out of the tower resulting in too powerful actions. At the end of our three games twice we had all islands built to 99%. You did all you wanna do during the game. Actions should be more scarce so you're kind of urged to prioritise.

Remark to Kickstarter: After delivery, Fed Ex charged me another 25 Euros for their service and I thought I paid via Kickstarter for the game AND shipping. Thumbs down for being duped.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]
Amerigo was not a game I was eyeing nor was this in my buy list, in fact I had totally forgot that a game called "Amerigo existed." But then Renu found this game out of nowhere and she demanded that she needs it. And a man cannot deny his wife's demands for a board game. With that said, I went into Amerigo totally blind, it was Renu's responsibility to learn the game and teach me too.
And after the first play, I just fell in love with the game - point salad is great.

[b]Components and presentation:[/b]
I remember feeling a lump in my throat painfully go down when I saw the size of Amerigo's intimidating box slowly revealing itself and the character with the monoscope, that's as big as Scythe- woah!!. 
I admire Queen Games, and this is not just because I enjoy their games but because of their quality of components-to-price ratio . I found Queen Games produce not just unique and engaging euro games but the quality of their cardboard pieces (yes! I am serious) are really thick and 'feels' good to hold. How did I arrive on this absurd opinion; Well because I own 2 games from Alea (albeit they are published much earlier than the Queen Games's games I own, hence I don't want to go too hard on Alea here), and they are really flimsy, thin cardboard tiles that won't come off the punch-board properly, and so from a components-to-price stand-point I really wasn't satisfied with Alea's production. Wonder what Terraforming Mars's excuse is for such a lazy production (but that's not important here). 
- Our game's cube tower came pre-assembled, neatly sitting within the insert.
- The insert in the game works really well and holds everything together nicely
- Tiles are nice and thick and the modular board pieces are sturdy and the puzzle like boarders fit perfectly well together

So with that said, I really like Queen Game's quality of component and I really enjoy the typical quirky euro style artwork anyway, it really suits board games, especially euro. Outside of the board game component, not really sure if I would like such art. And as dry as the in-game art is I still really like it and love the box's cover art. I wish however the rondel and player board was a bit more presentable rather than the dry-matte look the publishers decided to go for.

[b]Reasons I like playing it[/b]

Like I mentioned, went into Amerigo blind and when Renu was teaching me, I wasn't that hooked either. The cube-tower looked nice. But once I played, oh! did I enjoy it.

- Non-conflicting euro
- The [url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BZwNDb3Bd3a/]cube-tower[/url]
- I really enjoy the choices the game gives you in a turn but you have one option to choose
- I really like the modular board and how it scales and shrinks with player counts
- Plays well with 2 and more players
- Really enjoy the scoring system of islands 
- I like the race for islands and sharing scores, which creates a nice non-direct-conflicting competetion


[b]Favourite gameplay mechanisms[/b]

- Cube Tower randomising actions (well I couldn't have been more obvious, now could I?), however it's not just the cube-tower's fun gimmicky'ness, it's the whole action selection Mr. Feld build into this randomising gear and how you can always do something even if the cube decides to imprison the colour you wanted badly.
- I really like the mini tetris-type tile laying this game has and sometimes if the opponent decides to share your island just after you have planned your buildings, it can be really annoying (in a good way)
- The progress track's benefit tiles you pick up as you cross a milestone on the track, helping you with certain abilities that only you have
- The number of actions you can take based on the cubes that gets spat out: Now to be fair, the credit of this has to go to the cube-tower but Mr. Feld takes the trophy home for implementing it as he did 
- The whole island scoring part, I like it when games have a small race element for phase scoring, if you have played Mr. Feld's best, [thing=84876][/thing], and if you recall the region scoring + adding the phase scoring, you know what I am talking about - it's the same thing but this time the difference is that if you have an opponent with you on the island they get to score along with you.
- The planning you need to do for which island to chart and build trade, so as to maximize your commodity collection for end game scoring as well as making sure get best points you can by laying the Neutral tiles and probably snag an island completion scoring too
- Really like the choice during the planning action, between the high scoring neutral tiles (which are limited) along with your own player-colour village tiles, which are more in number but generate less score.
- The huge end-game scoring shift that happens if you have really managed your commodity collections, people seems to pay less attention to it most of the time
- The white action space, this is really neat. So here you can not only duplicate the action of the colour you are on but also move up in turn order - which has its merits in Amerigo, but not as punishing as [thing=31594][/thing]

[b]Things I am not very fond of in the game[/b]

Amerigo is a game I adore and would play it more and I am enthusiastic about teaching people who haven't played it yet, and like it probably more than Renu does (funny how it's her selection). So with everything that I like about Amerigo, there are few aspects I wish this game had. So it's more of what I wish this game would be rather than faults of the game.

- A bit more theme, I know, I know, I know; Theme is not my primary inclination for board games, however a game that beautifully integrated cube tower (and not for combat) and has this grandiose box with a beautiful cover art, I wish it had a bit more theme about sailing and building in an island, like Akrotiri has (not asking for the same).
Quoting Renu here [q="Renuka2010"][i]Amerigo Vespucci's presence is not even felt as a faint passing whiff, even if you chart every island on the map you won't find a spec of his influence throughout the game[/i][/q] Now, I am going to contradict my thematic merits of this game by defending it, just couple of lines after claiming it to be less thematic by gently arguing with Renu's points there, so I felt that the sailing, planning buildings and constructing them carefully so you can acquire the commodity in the region, is quite thematic wherein you are establishing a trade-centre or a colony, that's quit thematic if you ask me - but somehow I wish Amerigo himself had some kind of role in the game.

- The pirates, what a joke!! Yes, they keep getting powerful every round, but come on - makes I wish it would make us shudder like [thing=31594][/thing], after a point in the game you don't really care about defending your islands (or your VPs) because you sneeze and your are getting points from the game and probably you have some progress tokens that might help you defend your islands even further, however if you aren't and you are lagging heavily behind then you better worry about the pirates and make sure you are well defended. Filthy pirates, no one is afraid of you - stop raiding! I will pummel you with my scores.

Minor gripes those, I really enjoy Amerigo and it was a surprise hit for me personally. Renu isn't as enamored by it as I am and thinks it's a very easy game, and I again respectfully disagree here that it's not. Because even though you are scoring points like it's nobody's business, so is your opponents and failing to keep tabs of that will hit you in the end game scoring, especially with the commodity scoring.
Yes, the cube-tower is another randomiser for Mr. Feld instead of dice, but I cannot imagine Amerigo any other way. The cube-tower is really a integral part of the game.

Why then only 7? Well to be honest, 7 is a high score for the game for me and that means it stays in the collection and a game that I am really eager to teach new people too.

My favorite Feld of the year (better than Brugges, Rialto, and Bora Bora for me).  We played with 4 and it lasted quite a while longer than 75 minutes.  I prefer the plan ahead of the Mancala board in Trajan to the cube tower in Amerigo, but like the Amerigo design more.  Amerigo also felt a round too long.  A round shorter and perhaps not all islands would be fully completed.  As it is, certain actions are not that useful in the later game, so instead of the game opening up as you play along, it actually closes down, which is anti-climactic.  Need to play again.  Rating could go up or down.

Amerigo is a solid game, but nothing I would be waiting for. It doesn't offer anything new, except for the action-distribution through the dicetower, but even that isn't new, really. Other games had a random action-distribution before, just not with the tower, but that doesn't make it any better.

This is another Stefan Feld's games where you can have many ways to score VP. As all other Stefan Feld's games you have a wide variety of actions every turn to select from to perform. 

The cube tower which traps/release cubes is a new mechanism I find that gives a different feel compared to using conventional dice to determine players actions. Before the game starts 7 cubes of 7 different colours will be dropped in the cube tower. X amount of cubes will be stuck in the tower and the rest will be arranged according to its colours. The first player then starts the game by dropping all the blue cubes that dropped out from the tower on the setup phase. X amount cubes will again fall off and the highest total of one colour cube will determine the number of AP players have on that turn. The variety of colours of cubes that came out determines what type of action players can choose from. For example if 5 blue cubes were dropped into the tower and 4 blue and 2 green 1 red and 1 yellow cube came out, players can choose from blue, green, red or yellow actions and 4 AP for that turn.

There are many actions players can choose to do - explore (blue), plan (red), load cannons (black), build (green), change turn order/special action (white), research (brown) or build factories for plantations (yellow).

Amerigo plays 2-4 players and from my play testing solo three times I would rate this 7/10. Like the variety of actions and players racing to compete buidings to score additional VP

Amerigo is a mid-weight area control/set collection point salad game from Stefan Feld, using the Cube tower to select possible actions and the number of action points available to use by players.

The game board is a framed set of square tiles, with islands and waterways. Islands offer trading posts, resource spaces and blank areas.

Because of the random generosity and paucity of the cube tower, the tight action selection of, say Bora Bora isn't found here.  Instead players seem to have more flexibility in choosing their paths forward.

Feld included a penalty for those who do not spend at least a minimum amount on guns: pirates must be overcome each round or a VP penalty is assessed.

But in most cases the penalty in not advancing is simply not gaining the VP offered.

By discovering, settling and building out islands, players gain VP. At the same time, as they build over resources they collect them as trade goods, which they match to production tiles for VPs at game end.

There is also the option/temptation to grab advance tiles and use them for one time bonuses or other added efficiencies in play.

How does all this play out?  In quick fun turns which don't seem to bog down much and which stay entertaining.

I think this all works well to make a nice mid-weight game with an interesting and fairly unique mechanism.

I don't rank it among Feld's very best, but that would be a very select group- this game does what it set out to do quite well.

I really like the modularity of the board, and mixing a rondel with a Wallenstein tower provides a nice amount of uncertainty. 

As far as the bad, it feels a round too long, and the board actually looks worse when filled than it does at the start.

In the print I played, it was very hard to distinguish black and brown under a warm light. Less of a problem with a colder fluorescent

It's ok. The dice tower is a gimmick but it's nice; the way the cubes come out and thus dictate available action points and available actions is a really neat mechanism. The actions are all nicely balanced since you need them all to synergise but can't take all of them efficiently

(06/07/2014) Comment based on 2 plays.

This is a another creative Feldian design, with the requisite chaotic turn/choice generator, time-diminishing bonuses, time-limited access, multi-mini games "point salad" game, with a substantial geographic/spatial element.

After starting to enjoy Stephan Feld's various designs, I am beginning to see rough similarities in Castles of Burgundy, Trajan, Notre Dame, Bora Bora, Sh!t Happens, and Amerigo. As for the chaotic element, instead of using dice, he turns to the cube-tower mechanism in Wallenstein/Shogun, in order to give players a range of choices that are somewhat randomly generated each turn. Depending on how the cubes fall out, each player has the choice of taking a number of action points of the pre-scripted action for the current turn, or an alternative action if the appropriate cube falls out. Beyond that, it there are a number of mini-games on the board, where players are competing for having most presence on a given set of islands (the map is geomorphic), building up and closing out an island (and get an appropriate bonus on how quickly it was done), collecting the most commodities (dependent on ship movement on the board) and most factories (dependent on first-access to factor chits), having technologies (similar to the yellow knowledge tiles in Castles of Burgundy), having enough cannons to defeat the pirates (a common foe that must be dealt with each turn, much like the wildings in A Game of Thrones), or turn order track.

Feld throws a number of randomly generated elements at the player: varying and increasing strength of the pirates, random assortment of technologies, random assortment of factories, random map board with varying settlement locations, random location of commodities on the board, and random assortment of choices each turn. Like his other games, it is a matter of evaluating the relative VP value of current choices versus the future-value of VP for setting up scoring structures. As always, Feld does not make this choice easy for the players, because the optimal path is not clearly discernible. There is fierce competition in nearly all of his mini-games in Amerigo, but sometimes it is best to not even compete in one or two of them, and focus on doing well in other areas. At first, the sheer number of choices is overwhelming and seemingly unmanageable, but after a few turns the range of optimal play becomes somewhat evident. Still, the uncertainty introduced by the other players makes even this path sufficiently opaque. The enjoyment comes from being able to "read" the game state and make decisions based on a number of disparate pieces of data, and the satisfaction of successfully completing one of Feld's mini-games.

It is a neat game, with a large footprint; there is plenty to do here, as well as ponder. The theme of civilization building in the Caribbean is evident with the geomorphic board, as well as the buildings placed on them. I look forward to exploring more of this. It is a solid "8", with room to go up.

It's pretty and actually more fun that it looks—all the various Frankenbits end up kind of working together, I guess... But this just really isn't my bag.  Every goddamn thing gets you points, and we're all so busy drinking from the stinging gush of the point-hose that it's difficult to quickly gauge relative position until it suddenly stops and we're left standing there in the silence, blinking against the wet—soaked and dripping—and it turns out someone's more engorged than everyone else.

Nagy Feld rajongó vagyok, játékai többsége meg van, ami nincs meg, az meg beszerzés alatt van. Ez az első játéka amelyik csalódást okozott. 5 forduló van, és minden fordulóban 7 akciónk van. Az akciópontokat és fajtájukat a dobótoronyból kijövő kockák száma határozza meg. Általában 5 akciópontunk van két fajta akcióból. Emiatt elég egysíkú a játék, mindenki ugyanazon akciókat kénytelen csinálni. Igazából a győzelemhez egyetlen út vezet. Építkezni kell, ez magában pontokat ad. Az árujelzőkkel lehet pontokat szerezni, amiket szintén építkezéssel szerezhetünk be. Szigetet kell befejezni a plusz pontokért és ehhez is építkezni kell. A hajózás is az építkezéshez kell, mert csak ott tudunk építkezni, ahová már hajóztunk. 

Szóval semmi érdekes, változatos nem volt a játékban. Alacsony az újrajátszhatósági faktora. 4-en játszottunk vele és mindnyájan untuk a játékot.

Játszottam még egyet vele és továbbra is az a véleményem, hogy ez egy unalmas, érdektelen játék. Megint úgy álltunk fel az asztaltól, hogy ezzel a játékkal nem szeretnénk játszani, így tovább rontottam a pontszámán.

This is more confrontational than most Feld games, because players have to fight for space on a shared board. This could get a little frustrating at times. Still, the idea of taking actions based on the cube tower is very cool. I did wish that more cubes would stay in the tower, so that we wouldn't already know that X action won't happen this round, etc.  (1 play)

Fantastic. Hands down the best Feld title ever.Offering a ton of critical decisions through the use of the innovative cube tower, with enough variety that each game plays differently.  The map exploration element and tetris-like tile placement really make this game stand out from Feld's more abstract titles. Love this game. The threat mitigation element with the pirates is also a nice touch that was missing from Castles of Burgundy. While I love both games, and both have a place at the top of my collection, this has a more elegant, polished feel to it.

I'm a big Feld fan, but this game is disappointing.  The cube tower is very poorly designed and inevitably cubes get stuck.  By the end of the game, whatever cubes you drop in just come right back out again.  Ruins the game.

Fine game, the cube tower was a sort of interesting way to randomize what actions were available and it kept things somewhat interesting, but honestly the game did feel a bit like a bunch of disconnected things that all got you some points (a criticism leveled at many Feld games, but that I think is often not appropriate). There was a blue->red->green progression to build on islands, but it doesn't add anything interesting to the game, it just means that you basically need to have taken one red point for each green point you take. The pirates are also sort of boring, you just have to take enough black actions before the end of the round or you lose a bunch of points, and that's all the black action does. The white action being either turn order or sort of wild makes things a little interesting, but not enough. Pretty generic euro, nothing wrong with it but nothing special either. Maybe fun once in a while.

So easy to teach for the weight of decisions presented.  Maybe my new gateway mid weight game to transition folks from TTR, Dominion, and 7 Wonders?

Feels more focused than the other Felds I've played recently.  For better and or worse.

I love the cube tower mechanic.  Flipped the "B" side, per forum suggestions, as after the first round of the game the tower was routinely holding only 3-5 cubes; now it seems to retain 4-8, and we get a little more variation in AP value emitted.

Sail around and explore.  Use a cube tower.  Woo.  In my first play, I started out the game last in turn order, and it seemed like I always got screwed for the first time around the rondel. (Note: I later learned we got a rule wrong, so I didn't get the extra coins for turn order).  I was actually in first place a large portion of the game, but I got the fewest bonus points.  By a lot.  So much for that. Update: I played again and again got last in turn order. This time, I did get the bonus coins. I spent most of the game last in turn order anyway. But, much better experience with the correct rules.

This was an interesting game with a Euro flavor.  There are a number of ways to score points (point salad) and you have to do a few of them in order to win the game.  I had a good time, but it seemed like there was forced diversification.  I had to put efforts into working in different areas.  

I did enjoy the use of the cube tower to determine which actions could be used on each turn.  It increased the planning that needed to be done while also adding some randomness.

Wow! I've only played one Feld game (Castles of Burgundy), so I can't compare it to the rest of that mini-genre, but this is a great game.

This is Feld's take on the rondel, and he pulls it off with aplomb. Looks overwhelming at first glance, but it is actually very elegant and easy to teach, as you just walk around the rondel (feldel? ronfeld?) - This is a great, medium-weight game in a big box (if you are looking for a heavy-weight game in a medium box, go check out Bora Bora).

Initial Rating. 6.5 (January 2014)

Amerigo, light-medium weight game. This is the first game I have played with a dice tower and I really liked it :D. (I played Wallenstein once, but it was an online game). The box is very big, but the components are gorgeous. The map is very well done and playing with the dice tower is a lot of fun (it determines which actions and how many times you can do them). It has some similarities with Bora Bora and Castles of Burgundy (the faster you build the more VPs you earn) and you can (for the most part) plan your moves ahead. I LOVE how the dice tower works, you know which action can be available because there are 7 cubes from each color, but it is not assured, great stuff. As there are few options each turn, the game flows quickly and you don’t feel the downtime, but still you have a lot of interesting decisions when 2 colors or more pop out the tower (in my games almost always there were multiple colors). It has a lot of replayability (modular board, random progress, production and pirates tiles).

I’m worried that the pirates penalty is not severe enough as in other Feld games (the rats in Notre Dame and the demand tiles in Trajan), a lot of players took the punishment without any problem. I have to play more to see if this is an issue.

The rules are clear for the most part, the intermediate scoring confused us as the term implies that we score VPs but that is not the case, in fact you can lose VPs due to the pirates. Other than that, the game is easy to teach and learn, you can explain it under 20 minutes. 

I’m amazed how many games Feld published on 2013, and I have liked all the games I have played (I’m still missing Rialto, I expect to play it on February). I think Amerigo is a good game, however I feel it is a little light for my taste so I don’t think I will buy it, but for now, I won’t say no to a game of Amerigo. Of the 2013 Feld games, I vastly prefer to play Bora Bora over this one, Bruges is on the same level than Amerigo, but I think I like it a little bit more.

2014-01-11 - Surprise, surprise, another winner from Feld. This is a pretty great Euro exploration game, even without the cube tower for randomization. There are interesting strategies to pursue for each of the different action types. For the first time in a Feld game, I actually don't hate the the turn order track. That big wild space at the end makes pursuing white a much more interesting prospect. The sailing and modular board are fun, the Tetris-y tile laying is cool. Sure, the cube tower can be stingy, but I even think that makes the game more interesting. Definitely some interesting decisions here. Worth checking out.

2017-11-06 - I'm dropping my rating of this. This is a solid game, but it just doesn't get to the table over other options. It's size (lack of portability) makes it a bit harder to get to the table, too.

This modular board action-point driven game comes with a dicetower. You throw action cubes in the tower, and the amount of cubes exiting determines your number of actions and available action points. The game is nice and simple and is actually a great deal of fun. Can't say the game is super innovative. But the mechanisms used are combined in a way that makes it work. My gaming group is not applauding this game in the same way I am. And I cant say what it is, that really elevates this game for me. But I really enjoy it..

Feld titles are all about creative action selection mechanics. Amerigo makes use of the cube tower for this purpose. The game itself has a nice spacial aspect with the islands and the buildings. It's definitely an enjoyable mix of actions to figure out and we liked the game. 

However, I'm not sure that I'm sold on the cube tower as an action limiter. There are 7 actions and for each action you take all of the available cubes for that action and drop them in. Whatever colors come out, those are the actions you can choose from. Sometimes only the single color comes out, which gives you few options. This is especially painful if it is a production action, you are going late in turn order, and there are no tiles left for you to buy. The game has moments like this that leave you with wasted turns. For this reason, Amerigo will never be my favorite Feld. I'm keeping it for now, but at some point I'll probably pare down to 4 or 5 Felds to keep and I'm not sure this one is going to make the cut.

This is another Feld game that I really enjoyed. The tower allows some flexibility since it somewhat randomizes the actions that are available. I didn't find this to be as critical to the game as I expected, but it added a fun element to the game. You sail around to islands where you settle and expand your territory. You also gather goods that work with production tokens that you buy to give you victory points. I really like the nautical theme and thought it was well implemented.

I enjoy most of Feld's games and I'm usually not one to call out a game for JASE. But Amerigo gave me the impression that it is the same game Feld has designed many times before with the single innovation of using a dice tower to create the available choices. Unluckily, the dice tower implementation is not necessarily great as the tower mostly ejects cubes of the colour just thrown in with the odd cube from previous colours aside. Beside that, it features action selection from a central pool, vying for turn order, alternative probably balanced ways to victory, containing negative influences, bonus tiles. It's professionally designed and developed, it works fine but it's not compelling.

Oh nose. It's my first Feld failure. This game felt like it was on rails with the game mostly deciding for you which actions you are going to take and when.

Is this really a Feld design? Doesn't feel at all like one.

The map play is potentially interesting, with so many conflicting priorities that the optimal move was rarely clear until the last rounds of the game. The turn order mechanism didn't work for me at all, there seem to be too few opportunities to manipulate it. The tracks (cannons, coins, progress) seemed pretty superfluous, almost like something added in only to make the rondel large enough.

But most importantly the cube tower wasn't working very satisfyingly for us, with there rarely being more than two options for which action to take, and sometimes just the one option. I'd love to know what kind of retention distribution the game was designed around. Right now it feels like the tower should usually hold at least the double the cubes it does.

Being a Feld game, complaining about the theme is a given (why can't there be more like "It Happens"?) But his games really are blending together and the only thing that distinguishes them is their gimmick/action selection mechanism. I really like the cube tower, at least in Wallenstein/Shogun, but here it really is nothing more than a gimmick. Since the available choices are open to everyone, I felt little excitement by seeing which cubes would tumble out.

I suppose the spatial component of the game sets it apart from his others, but the map and art in general is so bland and generic that I never even came close to feeling invested in the game.

The game looks like more of a brain burner than it really is, it's a fun and thematic point salad but it also rewards smart play and strategic planning.  The luck factor of the dice is mitigated by the fact that at anytime you can see exactly what pieces are still trapped inside the dice tower and can plan appropriately. 

Definitely a lot of interesting decisions, definitely multiple paths to victory, I love this game. Impressive to look at as well if you play this you will attract a crowd.

a little point salady like cob, but doesn't feel as random. more like you know what you will likely be able to do and maybe something else, rather than completely random

An okay game.  It's good but nothing that really grabs me and makes me say "I have to have this".  Love the cube tower; hate the tetris-like tile placement on the islands.  Make sure you go first and ignore the pirates.

Nagyon érdekes a körönként használható akciók mechanikája, az nagyon tetszett, Persze van benne egy jó adag véletlenszerűség, de nem éreztem durvának, azért egy része úgymond kiszámítható. Na jó, inkább sejthető, legfeljebb reménykedünk, hogy kipottyan egy-egy olyan kocka is, amire szükségünk lenne. Maga a szigetek lefedése, az azokon való kikötés viszont annyira nem nyűgözött le. Mindenféle sávtologatás, ami vagy technológiát, vagy haderőt, vagy pénzt, vagy körsorrendet jelent, a végén mindenből pont nyerhető, stbstb. Ha nem lenne benne az a dobótorony, amivel össze van kötve az aktiválási mechanizmus, akkor egyáltalán nem érdekelne az egész, így viszont legalább valamennyire érdekes volt. Nem lesz a kedvencem, de ha ez kerülne elő, játszom vele. :)

I was excited about this game when I first heard about it, because I love Stefan Feld's games, and I made sure to pick it up as soon as it became available. However, while attempting to learn the rules, I became a bit worried that the game might end up being a disappointment. Whenever I learn a new game, I always watch at least one tutorial video/review in order to see the game in action. Ryan Metzler (Dice Tower), gave it a poor rating, saying that it didn't feel like a Feld game and that he really didn't enjoy it. He even said he might get rid of it! This concerned me, because like Ryan, I loved all of Feld's other games - like Castles of Burgundy, Trajan, Bruges, Bora Bora, etc. What if this game did turn out to be a flop? 

Well, I'm happy to report that my friends and I gave it a test run tonight and we all LOVED it. In fact, one person wanted to play again as soon as we finished!

Personally, I saw a lot of Feld's previous games in this one, and similar dynamics at play. I really liked the cube tower and action points/available actions mechanism.
We all agreed that it was fun, offered lots of options for scoring, and had equal opportunity for playing an individual strategy and/or trying to hurt other player's strategies.

With a modular game board setup that can be built numerous ways and the randomness of bonus tiles and demand tokens which are available each round, it appears to offer a lot replayability.

I'm excited to introduce my other gaming friends to this one, and to try with the full 4-players (we were only 3 tonight).

Great game.

11-27-2013 - Demoed at BGG.  Great Feld experience!

02-16-2015 - Wow, I hadn't followed up on this with more comments?  This is a great game.  I look at it on the shelf and think "exploration adventure".  It's not really an adventure game (at all), and exploration is a big word for what you're doing here (you don't uncover anything or really "explore"), but you do drive little ships around in an attempt to settle areas on the board before others.  So I still think Exploration Adventure.  haha  The components are nice and I just really enjoy it.  Solid 8 for us.

Played in Essen 2013, but only half a game - still I got the feeling of it. Not the best Feld there is, not even close to it. There is very little suprises or clever moves available: mostly people do the same things in a same time. Dice tower brings more like a gimmick effect than anything new: in our game it feels like the tower should have collect more cubes inside of it, than it now did (after Spiel I've heard couple of more same statements) - is it different kind than Queen used before?

RATING: 7
The cube tower action mechanic is quite interesting as one is bound by the restrictions of the actions of the colors present.  The number of the highest present color is the available action points to use.  This is definitely another Feld point salad which flows quickly as the game is fairly simple in concept...unlike some Feld's!  Don't forego turn order...do so at your own risk.

Also, this game works perfectly well the way it is written.  Others seem to think they need to come up with fancy new concepts/ways to deal with cube distribution...don't get caught up in having to do so.  The cube tower has created interesting dynamics in all the games I've played thus far.  

Don't be afraid to lose points to pirates.  Take actions out of normal rotation.  Don't be afraid to take money.

The dice tower makes the game! ;)  Moderate player interaction and the element of how the game punishes you from round to round if you don't have what you need makes this game challenging, but very enjoyable.  Action points are limited by how many cubes come out of the tower per round per color.  The decision is how to maximize the potential action points to score the most points while stealing points from opponents.

The game initially put me off as it looked like a complicated Feld.  It was taught well to me and was surprisingly easy to understand.  You get actions based on a cube tower that will disperse cubes which give you different actions.  If cubes of other colors come out to you can take those actions instead.  There is a map that you can explore and settle.  Scoring is interesting and like most Felds, there are multiple ways to win.  I really liked it and would definitely be interested in playing again.

Absolutely love this game, which I wasn't expecting too. However it does have a couple of flaws. The pirates (black cubes) are the one really dud action. And turn order is overly important. It’s easy for the first player in turn order to dominate a larger island and completely hose any other competitor for that island. Despite this, still a great game.

Since being introduced to this game a short while ago, I have snapped and simply love this game.  It's simple mechanics of area control and point salad scoring paired with the randomization of the cube tower are so much fun.  I think this is the strongest "themed" Feld game.  You really feel like you are an explorer racing to claim as much territory as possible.  The cube tower is the real reason that I ran out and purchased the game, but since then, I can't play it enough.  I even enjoy putting the game away when finished because the insert is so intuitive and soothes my OCD.  Feld is definitely my favorite designer.

its competitive but you never get totally shut down like in the boring type of euro games

great game, great theme, great art, great components, even a great box insert, great weight, great play-time, great turn management, great amount of luck in + stratigy = choices, great mechanics, great balance, great value given to choices, great about of getting points without being a point salad

RATING: 7
Strangely enough, this is a Feld game that has a theme, and it's actually not pasted on some mechanics, but the mechanics really make the theme come alive.

Collecting the goods chips that are on the board, and acquiring the multiplier chips that go with them seems to be the winning strategy. For that you have to sail your boat to the right islands and colonize smartly. (Collecting chips, and multiplier chips, where did i see that before?.. hm .. Trajan? :-) )

The fuss on BGG about the fact that the game is 1 round to long is actually true (most of the time, I guess it depends on the tower). 

But what really didn't convince me was the tower that we know from Shogun and Wallenstein. Here it is used differently.  What bothers me is that it needs a lot of care and makes the game a bit too repetitive, performing always the same procedure before each round.

The game lasts 2 hours (with 4 players), but turns are fast, not too many options available when playing. In fact, sometimes the tower doesn't leave you any other choice and everyone is obliged to choose the same action.

Game material doesn't look very exciting, and the box is ridiculously big. 

One of the lighter Feld games.

I was late to this one, put off by the many cubes and fear of a "cube economy" like I've found in other Feld games. But here they're used differently, and the variable board takes on a greater role. It's also a shared, central board--not individual player boards. These are all steps back to the way social boardgames should be played, I think.

FUN:  the cube tower gives you an indication of what's likely to happen, but you still need to tactically consider backup plans when it defies your expectations.

UNIQUE: the use if the cube tower as an selection mechanism for the available actions is interesting, but I thought that the colored space on the turn order track dictating your possible backup move for the turn was especially brillliant.

NEGATIVES: it has a few mechanisms/scoring possibilities too many. I especially thought that gold could have easily been left out.

Amerigo is a very interesting, if somewhat abstract game design.  The idea of the cube tower and how it works to determine what options are open to players on any given turn certainly is unique.  The tower's mechanic also lends some amount of tension as you hope what you need will fall through to the bottom to become available.

It's a very thinky game that takes awhile to get through.  For me this is a detriment.  I typically like fairly fast (two hours max, but one hour or less is even better) games that are fun to play.

I very much appreciate the design of Amerigo, and would play it again once in awhile, but for me this is nowhere near a "go to" game.

Great solid euro game. The cube tower may come off a little gimmicky to some, but I like it. Granted, it has functional issues from time to time. 
The gameplay is great: pick a cube and take the action of that color, with the power of whatever color comes out of the tower the most, I.e. the number of cubes of the most represented color.
It is very Feldian in that you have a variety of actions that score points in their own way. Pick up resources, fight pirates, explore, design, build. 
If you’re on the fence and it’s at a good price, go for it.

With the right expectations, this is a decent game.  Just don't expect the next Macao or Trajan.  It's a light game with a high production value.  I think of it as a good intro to Feld, and the tower can help interest players that may find other Feld games a bit dry.  Kind of funny, but I'd enjoy the game more if it took up less space on my shelf.

RATING: 6
Love the random island setup and using the cube tower to determine action points and availability.

Don't like that the fifth round lacked any real decision making. At the end of other Feld games (Macao, CoB, Notre Dame) I feel like I can't do everything and wish I had just one more turn. In Amerigo, I felt this way towards the end of the fourth round.

Is the cube tower not functioning as intended, or is this meant to be a more leisurely game? I didn't keep precise track, but on most turns I'd say we had 4-5 action points. Wondering if it should be a bit lower?

Update - I flipped and rotated Tab B of the dice tower. Testing indicated more action choices but fewer action points per turn. The resulting three player game was tighter, with many choices to make during the third round. We didn't max out the progress track, had trouble fighting the pirates, and didn't finish all of the islands. Much better!

RATING: 7
Update: well, it is not a bad game, but the excitement about it has ceased a bit. It is slow playing for the limited depth it offers. The procedure of collection the cubes, throwing them in and putting them out again is time consuming. And it makes the game very tactical, not strategic. Feld has done better this year and before and hopefully after.

One of the more enjoyable games of Essen 2013. Not heavy but good decisions to be made. I like the use of the dice tower, which decides the actions available to choose from. Price is absurd, I wait till it drops. And why is it necessary for Queen to use Kickstarter? Feld and Queen always sell. KS is for new or small companies that are just starting, that don't have the funds to pre-pay the game production.

A really great game about exploring islands, building buildings and grabbing goods.

I especially love the unique action selection mechanism, which takes form of a cube tower. The cubes colours represent different actions (exploring, cannons, planning, progress, building, buying, special), in every game round, the featured cube colour is dropped into the tower, making it more likely that cubes of that colour is going to fall out. What comes out determines which types of actions are available, and how many points you can use towards your chosen action.

This is a really interesting feature because there is both a luck element on what actions are made available on a given turn, but at the same time you can make informed decisions based on how many cubes are left of any given colour in the tower, so you can estimate the likeliness that at least one of them will come out in one of the coming turns and plan accordingly.

Really enjoyable game, very glad I picked it up.

This seems to be the year of Feld. Here we have a mid-weight game, again with multiple ways to score but here he uses the cube tower to good effect. Each turn cubes are thrown into the tower and they determine what actions can be played. Each action corresponds to a different cube color and one can take an action of either of the cube colors that fall out with the strength of the largest number of cubes in one of the colors. So if 3 blues, 1 red and 1 yellow drop out you could take a blue, red or yellow action with a strength of 3. Strength corresponds to the action and could be (how much you could build, how much you could buy, how far you could travel by boat, etc.)

What I really enjoyed is the spatial quality of the game as there's a race to sail to the various islands and build on them. They can fill up quite quickly and once an entire island has been built on their are VP bonuses for those on the island. Although there's quite a lot going on the turns can go quite quickly as it's a series of small actions.

I was surprised to like this one as much as I did. At first the idea of Feld+cube tower sounds like a no-brainer but I had convinced myself, based on reviews and such, that it wasn't worth playing. But I had the chance and rather enjoyed it. The island placement can lead to a bit of AP but the rest of the game flows quickly and smoothly. All of the actions are interesting. It's very Feldian and fun. I'm not motivated to own it; it's a bit expensive and long such that I would usually choose a different Feld over it. But good.

Dropping cubes in the tower is super fun. After that weares of there is a really uninteresting game left.

If you like Feld's designs, you'll feel at home here. The spatial elements are a bit of an added twist; you sail your ship around the randomly-generated board, build trading posts then occupy those islands and claim resources by playing Tetris-shaped buildings.

The cube tower is neat. It feels a bit gimmicky, but works to randomize the actions available from round to round. It randomizes them in a way that dice or cards cannot. 

You've also got the usual pain mechanism in the form of pirates. After 2 plays, they were almost an afterthought in game 1 then a pain in the ass in game 2. They started off weak and stayed that way in game one, and started strong and stayed that way in game 2.

All in all, I'm really geeked about it after a couple of plays. It feels like it belongs in the upper echelon of Feld games, which means something coming from me.

This has become a favorite. It's got the usual Feldian scoring stuff happening, but it's also a game of throwing elbows and jockeying for turn order. You race for the good settlement positions early, move up in turn order so you can wall people off from resources by placing buildings in the way.

As with other Felds, the game is straightforward but uses a randomizer to restrict available actions each turn.  This one uses a cube tower. 

Amerigo turns out to be quite enjoyable.  It has some setup, but otherwise is fun, has a quick pace, and some tension between setting up for later or scoring points now.  One of the longer Felds, though, usually clocking in at about 2 hours for the 4 player game.

The cube tower in Amerigo is a lot of fun. It has a similar feeling to rolling dice, where sometimes you're hoping that a certain color cube happens to fall out to allow you to complete your strategy. In that respect I felt like the game had a similar feeling to Macao, and given how much I enjoy that game, that's a good thing.

The rules for this one are much simpler than one would think by looking at the all the components. The game is fluid and very entertaining. The cube tower is fun and the overall gameplay is very enjoyable. There is a little bit of a racing feel trying to beat others in exploration of islands, acquiring commodities/landscape tiles, and turn track order. Don't forget to watch out for pirates. This game seems to have many ways to score points and succeed.

Amerigo has staying power with me if only for the cube tower. It's a gimmick that is central to a pretty derivative Feld design, but I enjoy it all the same. I have a lot of fun with this game, but it doesn't come out as often as it probably should. Setting it up is kind of a pain, and there's a lot of "I'll do this action," followed by: "I'll do that, too." It's one of those games where the subtle differences in what people do win or lose them the game. It also bothers me that scores can be really high or low depending on what comes out of the tower, though maybe it shouldn't. I enjoy Amerigo, but the main reason I keep it around is because it is one of my wife's favorite games.

Amerigo is a bit too much of a point salad for my taste but I like the spatial aspect where you try to settle islands and claim resources before your opponents. The cube tower may return too many cubes at the time, making the actions too strong and the board changes between your turns too big. Still a pleasant game with a lot of opportunity for the playsers to screw each other.

It's a very solid design. Much of the Feld's essence is captured, with points and choices everywhere - this time with more interactive and a little bit of cooperative elements because you need to sail and build the islands together. 

The one thing that held the game back from being a really great game, is the cube tower. Perhaps I had too much hope in it generating a variety of choices every turns, but after a few turns the choices decrease dramatically. I would try flipping inner insert and see if it works better.

In this Stefen Feld game, players are exploring an island. Players actions are determined by cubes which fall out of a cube tower. There are 7 different possible actions represented by the 7 different colors. Black gives you defence against pirates, blue lets you move with your ships, red lets you buy tiles, green lets you place tiles on islands, brown lets you gain technology, white lets you go first in turn order, while yellow lets you purchase godds multipliers. 

It's a five round game, and it will take you approximately 2 hrs to  play. I only played half a game, but I'm intrigued to want to play a full game.

It's not as heavy or as long a game as the size of the box implies. Unlike other Felds, in the very last round of Amerigo it feels like there are no more actions to perform -- the remaining technologies are of no use, all the goods tiles have been purchased, enough cannons have been deployed, all the island spaces have been settled, everyone has maxed out all their tracks. The game has ended not by dint of running 5 rounds but of running out of things to do. (At least it beats Yedo in this respect, since in that one you run out of things to do with 3 rounds still left to go). A fun game that reminds me a lot of Castles... after playing this, my favorite 2013 Feld remains Bora Bora.

I bought this game through a holiday sale and was really blown away by it. It has a lot of the Feld tropes in its design, but I really like the way it all comes together.

Really great purchase.

RATING: 3
The dice tower provides the available actions and also an estimate of the actions that may be available in further phases of the round. This is fairly clever, but a little bit random. Based on this idea a fairly uninteresting eurogame was built, with a map included where players compete with their ships accessing islands with wares whose value depends on other actions; special tiles modifying actions and providing some player interactions also introduced, increasing randomness. As usual with Feld games a player order track is introduced as well. This is not one of Mr Feld´s strongest titles. Second game was even more annoyingly random.

--- Preliminary Thoughts ---

It's a typical Feld, maybe a bit lighter than usual.

The star of this game is the cube tower that dictates what actions can be done. This is the luck element in this game; it also allows some planning because there's a lot of things you can plan about this tower:
-> If next turn few cubes will be introduced in the tower, it's likely that few cubes will be able to come out.
-> If lots of cubes of one colour are stuck inside the tower, probably this action will be available next turns...
-> Etc.

I don't like the players having the same actions and number of actions available.

The components are nice (nothing really special for the high price of this game). The board is escalable depedning on the number of playes, and it can become huge.

-> Some say there are not so many paths to victory: there's always a best action to do. Not sure about that.
-> Some say towers do not always work well?
-> Maybe a spatial problem: if 2 players fight for an area of the map, the 3rd player has all chances to win?? to be confirmed!

Conclusion: It's not one of the best Felds out there at all, and its price is way too high even for the components.

I like it well enough at 2 players. I'd like to see it at higher player counts. It seems there are really two strategies. Go for the big island building or go for high multipliers in the farming and production.

I'm sure I'll play it at least a couple times a year. It's pretty easy to teach, and a new player with some gaming experience will be up and running quite quickly. The cube tower is fantastic, too!

Fantastic game that's easy to play and really is a great week night game. It's a nice medium weight game with fun and strategic decisions to be made. When I first came across Amerigo, I thought it looked extremely bland and unexciting. But when you set the game out to play it looks amazing. I am really becoming a great fan of Stefan Feld games. He always seems to come up with new and fun mechanics that make a game unique and clever to play. Amerigo is no exception. 

The cube tower and the action rondelle are the heart and joy of the game. It provides a superb amount of luck and replay ability to the game all in one. Throw the cubes into the tower and what comes out determines the actions that you can play each turn...guaranteeing a different game experience every time. Plus the board with all it's islands is completely interchangeable and new with every game set up.

Sometimes with Euro games or worker placement games the game play experience is so emersive that after playing one game I am satisfied enough to not play it again for awhile. Not so with Amerigo; I was ready to play again the next day. Fun!

Solid game, one of the more accessible Feld's. Cube/action mechanism is quite inventive (and typical Feld), but as usual too much of a point salad. Not sure the game is extremely balanced, would need to play more to judge (e.g. not sure about Pirates and turn order track).

RATING: 8
One of Feld's largest games that looks a bit like a 4x game and, once again, has nothing to do with its theme. The action mechanic, which positions the imposing cube tower at the center of gameplay, is a bit confusing at first but works well for its intended use. There are many elements here that will remind players of many other Feld games like the turn order track, a technology track and getting shafted by the choices you made in the previous round. Fun isn't exactly the word I'd use for Feld's game as every action is immediately followed with a "Oh, I should have done that instead." Still, many people seem to enjoy this game as the components are well-made and the modular board adds to replay value. There was a time when this kind of game would have impressed me but Amerigo just seems like every other Feld game but injected with $20-$30 of aesthetics and quality.

A solid Feld game I like the tower randomness as we have had games were tons of cubes come out and then others were it consistently held on the little buggers. This is a mid-weight game that stays true to Stefen Feld's model being; It is a point salad with many options available to players from the start, and eventually you will have take all the actions but for the most part you control how you best earn your points.

RATING: 8
Very solid. Modular boards are always good for variety. I really like how the tower determines what actions and how powerful they are each turn. Some turns are straightforward and quick, others you have hard decisions over a few actions. They're the two standout features. After that it's your basic move your ship around the board to different islands, buy tiles, cover island with tiles to score lots of points and get goods tiles, later get goods multiplier tiles, plus compete along two different tracks for turn order (plus VPs) and extra action tiles (plus VPs). So it's all standard along those lines. Those extra action tiles will end up driving a lot of sway decisions, getting the most out of them to differentiate you from the other players. Plus the decisions on when to move to new (and which) islands and when not. Anyway, it all hangs together nicely. It probably should end after 4 rounds instead of 5 to keep you hanging nicely for more, but I guess once you know what you're doing, the last round should go by fast enough. While there's probably not much more to explore in term of what the game will provide, I'm happy to play again for the variety that the action cube tower provides.

Another quality Feld game that my wife and I enjoy. It is enjoyable to build out your islands and collect up the various resources. Plus, the cube tower provides a good level of decisions for a light-medium game. We tried it a few times with the typical "modified" tower but didn't like it. It made the game more tight and less satisfying.

It feels like a Feld game.  Point salad galore.  BUT...you get to sail your ship around the islands, place tiles on the islands, and fight pirates each round (well, kind of, if you use your imagination).  This is my kind of 'theme'!  So that's what makes this one stand out from other Feld games for me: island/sailing theme, and the tile placement.  And of course, the cube tower is a way cooler action selection device than rolling dice!  Great Feld game; lots of decisions to make; many paths to victory!

Amerigo is a game where you're trying to sail around your boat and claim real estate on islands before your opponents can.  The big innovation here is using the "cube tower" from Wallenstein to determine which actions are available each turn (and how big those actions are).  You're trying to collect similar goods tiles found on the islands as well as complete islands for points.  I was a little disappointed in the action system, as it didn't provide very much diversity: it seemed like players were doing mostly the same things on each turn.  Claiming land felt like a mad dash--"getting there first" seemed to be a big part of the game.  It's definitely a solid game, but it left me a little wanting.

Amerigo is very much a Feld affair along the lines of his other games of the last few years - an interesting action selection mechanism provides the players a framework to score points in myriad ways. The cube tower is certainly put to good use here, and can make for some interesting choices on a turn. Both of my games have been with 3 players, and I rather like that configuration. Turns generally go around the table quite quickly, and with experienced players, the game should take 75-90 minutes. 

There is a good bit of indirect interaction among players, as they race their ships to areas where trading posts can be built. Multiple players on the same island can also interact by blocking one another from grabbing goods tiles. 

All in all, I’ve enjoyed my plays of the game and won’t turn it down in the future, but I’ve taken it off my wishlist. I rank it below Burgundy, Trajan, and Luna and with those in my collection, I don’t see the need for this.

What Stefan Feld did with the dice tower is typically him: do something different with a known gaming mechanism/element. The disadvantage of his clever use of the dice tower is that there is quite a bit of manipulation needed with the cubes, which creates a certain downtime.

Big minus for me: I find the artwork really dull. By far the worst I've seen from Lieske and Stefan.

The game itself: not convinced after 1 play. Gaming time was a bit too long for me and I didn't get a wow-feeling after this 1 play. Then again, I didn't had a wow-feeling after my first play of Bora Bora either, while now I like it a lot. So hopefully Amerigo will evolve in the same way :D

Rather dry abstract-ish game. Various mechanics slapped together (blocking others with tiles, collecting sets for point multipliers, action bonus tiles) to ensure there are multiple paths to victory, but not making an overall engaging experience for me. First time I played with the cube tower, found it a very artificial action selection mechanism. I prefer games with fewer mechanics but serving the theme better and providing an overall experience, like Puerto Rico or Year of the Dragon.

Fantastic Family Game. Rules are very easy to remember, because the game has a great flow to it. For those who  have a hard time retaining information and hate to constantly refer back to the instructions every two seconds for rule clarifications, this game doesnt present many which is a bonus in my books. Some iconography to get used to, but not hard to remember after first play thru. Best game of the year. Would like to see this game make atleast top 50 for family game rank

In this game, cubes of a single color are dumped into a cube tower which is supposed to retain some of the cubes. Whichever colors of cubes fall out determines which actions are available each turn with an action strength equal to the highest number of highest number of single color cubes that fell. A big part of the strategy is counting the number of cubes of each color that aren't in the tower, and make predictions about the likeliness of future potential action opportunities that round. Like most Feld games there are a lot of different things to do to get points, but the different elements are nicely tied together.

I really enjoy the aspect of sailing around the map, putting down houses on anchor spaces, collecting the sets of different goods and placing the fantastic tetris-style pieces on the islands to claim areas. Having a set of neutral colored tiles that you can purchase, but then can count for any player placing across them is absolutely genius.

The one big issue is that the cube tower that comes in the box seems to have some trouble actually retaining cubes. This can lead to a lack of interesting tension as to what actions might be available in the future. If this single component was better constructed, I would have kept this game, but the debate about if the cube tower is functioning as intended or not wore me out every time I tried to get this to the table. Would absolutely rebuy a second edition of some kind with upgraded bits should that ever happen.

Well designed game with a lot of ways to get VPs (sounds like Feld?). Unique action selection mechanic whereby cubes are dunked into a contraption, some get stuck, some don't and whatever comes out is going to define the actions of that round. 

The ship actions can be a bit too strong combined with starting player, someone who gets key island spots to begin with, will be at an advantage. Other actions felt balanced.

Loved it!  You have to race to get everything before your opponents do, which creates a lot of tension, but is not a take that game in any way.  The cube tower adds variety and hope.  There's one green cube in there and I need to build this turn!  Yes!  It came out!  Lots of fun with a lot of strategy, and easy to learn as well.  One warning, however.  Stay with a 2 or 3 player count.  Four players makes this game a marathon.

No, ez egy kicsit megosztó játék, mert bár egyet kell, hogy értsek a fanyalgókkal, hogy itt bizony mindig kb. ugyanazt kell csinálni(Bár a sok vélemény nekem kicsit sarkítottnak tűnik), de szerintem nem abból adódik a játék izgalma, hanem az építkezés mikéntjéből, illetve a fejlődéslapkák választásából illetve azok időzítéséből. Azokból a sok kis plusz lehetőségből amit adnak. A játék vége fele, már volt olyan akció amit abszolút nem használtunk, csupán aranyért, de a fehér akcióból adódó lehetőségek változatosak lehetnek. Mindezt egy játék után mondom, 10.-re lehet kivégzem.:)

összefoglalva: Érdekes, nem újító, de korrekt játék. Van jobb Feld nyilván, de rossznak nem mondanám. Még eszembe jutott, hogy 4 forduló talán jobban állna neki.:D

Amerigo is an excellent and solid game. I have played it multiple times and will play again, I love some of it's mechanics. However the victory point salad isn't that catchy. I was also expecting there to be a little bit of Amerigo Vespucci theme which was sadly missing. I would have enjoyed it more if the theme would have been more actively a part of the game. Dice Tower or Cube Tower, whatever it is called is awesome.

Every time i throw cubes in the tower, I ask myself- is this how it's supposed to work? Despite this weird tool, which I feel could have much more easily been represented by dice or a deck of cards, the game works. It works surprisingly well! 

Once the cubes are out, it's smooth sailing. The actions on hand make sense and work together beautifully. I can feel the theme coming through the euro mechanics, and there's just the right amount of player interaction.

Overall, I think the tower will always feel a little off for me, and it will never rank among my favorite Feld games, but there is clearly a good game here. Looking forward to trying out the available promos.

UPDATE: I was so wrong. After multiple plays, the tower feels like a seamless addition, and Amerigo has actually turned into my #1 Feld, and currently sits in my top 10.

Extremely boring Feldian point salad. The cube tower action selection is innovative but not really exciting. To me there is just nothing interesting about this game. Some tracks to advance, some chits to gather. The island building is mediocre at best, but the whole design is just aweful. The color scheme is just ugly. I will try to avoid this game in the future.

I like this game quite a lot - it's probably my favourite of the 4 Feld releases of 2013 (although I feel I haven't played Bora Bora enough to properly assess it, but Rialto was a big disappointment and Bruges, while good, I found underwhelming). I've read a lot of complaints about the tower not retaining enough cubes, but it seems to work well for me, leading to interesting decisions and gameplay - while it's not that uncommon for all the islands to be completed by the middle of the final round, we've not had it happen before then, and when this happens (or is close) the game changes character in an interesting way, as everyone rushes for production tokens or progress tiles.

The tower strikes me as no mere gimmick, as you can always see what's left inside and can estimate how likely it will be for certain actions to come out later in the round - but not precisely, which makes this imo more interesting than any dice or card-based method of action selection. Deciding which action is most crucial for you to do right now is definitely not easy, and the progress tiles definitely shake things up by allowing you to get more out of certain actions or pushing you towards certain strategies. The pirates can be very harsh, but are also often ignorable, depending on what else happens in the game. And the early decisions of where you sail your ships and how you build on the islands (hopefully cutting rivals off from profitable areas) can be really key. (Turn order is also incredibly important in this game, even more so than in other Feld games, which means you have to choose the right times to take the white action.) There are also interesting dynamics over whether or not to help other players with the larger islands if you both have trading posts there. For what it's worth, I didn't much like my one 2-player game, but I find the game really interesting with 3 and 4.

And the modular board ensures that each game has a totally different arrangement of islands - this admittedly doesn't change the game enormously, but is nice nonetheless. This is definitely another fine game in the long tradition of great games from Feld. While it's certainly not as good as Trajan or Aquasphere, for me it sits easily alongside the likes of Macao and Notre Dame - and I definitely feel it is underrated on BGG. It may be a little easier to explain than most recent Felds, but this is by no means a light family game.

Very fun game with an extremely unique mechanic. In my group of 4, everyone played very differently, one focusing on island acquisition and expansion of the colonies, one spreading out between the various ways to score, and me aggressively snatching up all of a single type of resource and it's multipliers. At the end of the game, after we factored all of our points from our various conditions, our scores were comparable to one another's.

The trick to Amerigo is learning to adapt. If you can't get the actions you want in a turn, it's a good idea to have at least one backup plan.

RATING: 6.9
(+) Thematic feel to a Stefan Feld-title: always a big plus!

(+) Nice game material: the cube tower is used in an innovative way and gives this game an appealing dynamic. Despite complaints at BGG, in my opinion the tower exactly does what he's supposed to do: limiting options to all players in order to stimulate planning, risk-assessment and force players to think out of the box in stead of following the same pattern over and over, while still giving the game a structured flow.

(+) Interesting choices throughout the game keep all players involved

(+) Accessible game, yet interesting enough for veteran boardgame players


(-) Quite lenghty game compared to its game weight

(-) Certain mechanics might not not have turned out totally right: in certain occasions pirates and the corresponding cannon-actions might seem like a total waste and I can imagine certain technology tiles to never getting bought because they are totally outshined by all the other tiles.

(-) Cube tower does a good job of restricting options while still making sure there is more than enough structure to the game (normally, you will have a repeating sequence of the seven possible actions). Yet, this results in multiple players following the same path and options at a given time. At the start of the game, it is required that all players persue the blue 'sailing' action, other paths at the opening of the game are sure to screw your game, which make certain parts of the game pre-scripted -> This is a shame.

RATING: 7.5
Based on the negative buzz I was expecting a disaster, but this is a strong game from Feld again. It reminds me in places of Castles of Burgundy yet feels sufficiently different. Like CoB however the setup is a chore.

And yes the Cube Tower is a gimmick and I wish they had used another method to realise the 'statistical randomness' that it provides - it performs poorly and takes a large amount of table space for a game that already takes quite a bit of it. As a result we use the bag variant mentioned on BGG.

I have really enjoyed this Feld game. It is very different to his other games. I know people are saying this this game is not as complex as his other games he has designed. But that doesn't keep it from being fun. The key to the game to me is trying to figure the game out better and faster this the other player at the table. I love how turns are fast and it has a nice randomness to the game that keeps you wondering what actions will you be able to make from round to round. I like the tower even though player say you could just grab cubes from the bag instead. But I like the cube tower idea of cubes getting stuck and you may or may not see them at all. If you pull them out of the bag they will more likely get grab one time or another.

Amazing game - my favorite Feld! Takes a lot of what I love from Macao, but makes it a bit more forgiving, more interactive, and most importantly, some real theme. No point salad here.  And unlike Macao where gold was just an afterthought with a boring gold to point conversion, gold is so integrated into Amerigo allowing you to use gold to get a critical extra power or two to your action - lots of interesting decisions about when to use your gold.  The randomized board layout and randomized knowledge tiles provide a lot of replayability - different strategies might be better with different setups. And I just really enjoy rooting for the stuck cube of the color you want to finally drop.

very recommended tower-mechanic and some interesting decisions which you must do.
amerigo should have 4 rounds instead of 5. we have the repeated situation, that all anchor-fields are filled with trading posts and/or all islands are finished at the beginning of the fourth round. so what to do with the actions "red", "green" and "blue"? you must hope that another colour comes out of the tower.
update: i confirm my first notice above
in alle 4 games we also reached the end of the progress and order lines
there is an absence of discovery to raise up the eagerness for 5 rounds
i think the problem is, that the output of the tower is generally too high - so i turned the B-board - i will see ....

It's Feld and another very similar game to many of his recent releases - I did like the idea of the cube tower and the various actions available, but didn't enjoy the actual actions themselves, and the rest of the typical Feldy methods for scoring points.  By partway through the game I was just going through the motions, as it just wasn't very interesting, and the last round felt more like a last minute points grab, with very few things to do.

I had to "tweak" my tower, as per recommendations here on the Geek, to achieve results that were acceptable. Prior to the "tweak," I was dropping cubes in and pretty much getting the same ones out. With the adjustment, I have discovered a perfectly pleasant game. The cube tower is a very clever gimmick; I like it. The game plays a little long for my personal taste, but like so many games, if everyone already knows how to play, that makes a tremendous difference. It is an extremely "Feldian" game: if you like this designer, I bet you will like Amerigo.

Cube tower didn't seem to work as well as in Wallenstein. It often let all the cubes that got dropped through, so that we often didn't have much to choose from and the tower was so empty we decided to reseed the tower with all the cubes after multiple rounds in the game.

However, even still, I rarely wanted to do a move that wasn't the main move for that time period anyway, or in that order. The Sail, collect tiles, place tiles, pretty much has to be done in that order, so I didn't feel as much like I could do a bunch of different actions and they were all viable. Often it was 'well if i don't do the same action they do, they're going to get pretty far ahead in this'. It didn't help that for our game, pretty much everyone had explored all the islands, moved almost all the way up the turn order track, and maxed out their technology tracks, so it didn't quite feel like there wasn't enough opportunity to do everything in the game that you wanted to, since it would mostly get fully finished by the end anyway.

Anyway, after two rounds I started feeling like I was just going through the motions, almost like the game was playing me. I really wanted to like the cube tower here, but it almost seemed to detract from the game than help it.

Also, being in first place seemed to be consistently really important in this game, and you couldn't decide to jump the turn order unless a white cube came out, which was pretty annoying to me as well.

Another great Feld design.  It's an example of his nack for taking a "known" mechaninc and adding a new spin.  I love that the cube tower can spit out a very limited range of choices.  It happens infrequently enough that it's not a deal breaker, and it affects all players equally.

Wow! Another new mechanism by Stefan Feld that funtions very well and changed the dicetower from a warmachine into an indicator of possible player actions. Compared to his other games this one is the most thematic (maybe together with "Trajan"). But nevertheless I got the feeling that theme isn't important.
I think very important in this game is: being starting player and staying it.

Another Feld hit for me. The cube tower mechanic and the options that result from it feels like a spin on your nomral action selection via dice rolling. Turns move quick, and Feld has an innate ability to produce these strategic games that present just the right about of tactical choices without feeling overwhelming. Loved it.

Pros:
- CUBE TOWER!!!
- Fast game play and tight turns. Theme feels integrated well. 
- Tons of replayability with variable set up and different strategies to win
- Easy rules to grasp and teach

Cons:
- Set up can be a little bit of a bear

Typical Feld stuff here.  If you've played another of his games, this will feel familiar.  That isn't to say it is bad. In fact, I really enjoyed the cube tower and trying to build a little engine.

Damn it - he's done it again. Feld has designed another clever and pleasant to play points salad game. This one has some good timing, risks, races to ports, commodities, trading houses... stuff. It feels a primarily like a race game to me because everyone has the same choice of what actions to take and how many action points. The bit that separates the players is the racing part to get to the best goodies first. (Valuation of goodies isn't too difficult.)

It's all run by the cube tower, which provides a few interesting nuances over traditional dice or chits. With the tower you can always see how many cubes of a particular kind are balancing inside just itching to drop out. So that helps you calculate what action to take, when not to risk it and when you've got no chance at all. There's a few nice other bits with gold enabling you to buy essential extra action points. I especially like the player order track giving you another option to take a different action when a white cube drops out.

There will be a little bit of variation from game to game depending upon pirates, innovation tiles, player competition and strange cube distribution, but there's probably not going to be as much new feel from game to game as there would be with say Macao.

Nice and easy to learn despite there being lots of bits and pieces.

A good game I wouldn't mind playing from time to time and even with long breaks between games. Rules should be easy to keep in the head because it's all link well to theme. Very solid design.

I read lots of threads about this cube tower, tried some solutions, but ultimately the Tower just sucked completely.  Whatever was dropped in came right out, barely any cube retention, and definitely no surprises turn to turn.  So completely forgettable - the worst Feld.  And it's not even worth trying to trade - the game is massive, I'm not shipping this thing....

Enjoyable Stefan Feld game, kickstarted. Received Oct-18-2013. Not quite an exploration game, more exploitation. Uses a cube tower to dictate what kinds of actions you can take, and the mechanics are such that a certain action is generally predictable at certain moments, but sometimes the game throws you for a loop and you have to adapt. It runs a wee bit long than I'd like, and there is some truth to the complaints that maybe the game could be one round shorter. But the map is entirely in your control, especially if you have the mini-expansion map pieces, which can alter gameplay and the usefulness of the final round. Not my favorite Feld, and a huge box, but still fun and with the novel cube tower it's worth checking out.

This is a game that has certainly caused a rift in the Feldian community.  Some people detest it.  Some people love it.  Some people are meh.  I really enjoyed my first play of it.  I flipped my B tile and got great results with my 7 year-old daughter as the official cube-tosser.  Only a couple of rounds left us with one choice - perfectly acceptable to me.  Lots of fun and played quick.  I especially like how the building works with limited neutral tiles.  I'm a big fan and I can see myself offering to play this a lot in the future.

My wife and I love this game!  We think it is a great medium-weight Feld game.  There are always so many choices, so the game feels fairly open, however there was still classic Feld tension throughout the entire game. it is a beautiful board and we like that part of the set-up is random and changes each time you play.  The cube tower is awesome and works really well.  We have never had trouble with it like many others have reported.  Overall, we prefer some of Feld's heavier games over this one, but this is still a fantastic game and we thoroughly enjoy it.

Nice game with lots of options. Slight issue if you get locked into one side of the board and then you're pretty much toast. And the game rounds seem to go on just a wee bit too long, as we often have little to do and few options on the last few turns. Might be group-think.

Very interesting and quite fun. The cube tower adds that nice randomly generated ability to take actions outside of when you are "supposed" to take them. That can help you fix mistakes, or seize opportunities to take a 2nd action of one type during a round (and maybe a 3rd).

Rating after one play. I was tempted to put an 8 which means it would never leave the collection. Like Castles of Burgundy and Macao it combines a strategic game with a random element - in this case the tower (dice in the previous examples). It's good - despite the rather stupidly big box and intimidating cluster of components, it's deceptively simple. ++++UPDATED AFTER 6 PLAYS+++ However owing to limited space and rather long set-up and take-down I have traded it on. Unlimited cupboard room and I'd have kept it.

The cube tower is an intriguing mechanism, but it doesn't seem to play out that well. Most players are taking the same actions 80%+ of the game and towards the end, nearly all cubes are out of the tower.  Therefore, most progress tracks are all maxed out at maximum points and nobody really feels stressed complete stuff.  I have several complaints about the game: (1) it's possible to lock yourself out of most of the game if you don't explore a lot early on and get trading posts established on various islands so that you can build and get crops later; (2) the last round (and sometimes the last 2 rounds) seem irrelevant since most people have nothing left to do and so one player is just working to catch up; (3) the game just last too long.  Other than that, the production quality is nice, but there really isn't much theme to be felt in the game. Overall, the game mechanisms all work together and the cube tower is interesting, but I'd much rather play The Castles of Burgundy instead.

My gaming companions declared that they enjoyed the tile placement part, but very much disliked the randomization tower. I'm sure they will declare me totally nuts when I say that for me it was exactly the other way round.

Then again, I've never been much into this kind of building game; If I want to play Tetris, I will just play Tetris. Accordingly, I mostly tried to get points from technologies by connecting to resources on the board quickly, and left the filling of the gaps for scoring full island to the other players. That strategy did in fact work better than expected.

The action randomization I am however really fond of, and would be quite curious to see that tower combined with a different game. (Sorry, folks, sometimes I'm strange.)

A játékosok felfedezők, akik területeket telepítenek be, rajtuk épületeket építenek és közben különböző terményeket gyűjtenek. Fegyvert fejlesztenek kalózok ellen és új technikákat fejlesztenek, a Shogunból ismert kockatorony segítségével, ami az adott fázis választható akcióit és azok konkrét számát adja meg. Az akciók változatosságát adó kockatorony megoldás érdekes, de nem sokat ad hozzá a játékhoz, mert legtöbbször mindig az adott fázis legerősebb akcióját választják a játékosok, de ez a rész még a jobbak közé tartozik a játéknak, jók a különböző fejlesztéslapkák és a termények pontozása is tetszik a játék végén. A bajom a hajózással van. Egyrészt nagyon egyutas miatta a játék, mert a legtöbb pont a területek betelepítésével érhető el, másrészt nagyon egyértelmű, hogy minél hamarabb minél több kikötőt le kell építeni, mert nálunk a harmadik kör végén már minden lehetőség elfogyott, innentől a hajózás akciónak nem volt már értelme. Ez számomra hihetetlen hibának tűnt, hogy van olyan akció, ami kb. a játék felében nem használható. Nem érzek több stratégiai lehetőséget, menni kell, kikötőket lehúzni és gyorsan telepíteni a földterületeket. A játékban eléggé jelen van a konfrontáció is emiatt. Elég nagy lehet a pontok szórása is, ami szintén nem megszokott Feld részéről. Úgy érzem az Amerigo sajnos a gyengébb Feld játékok közül való. Egyértelmű csalódás volt.

A really nice worker placement game.

Unfortunately, this wasn't quite as good as I was hoping. It's got a lot of the usual Feld stuff, of course: many ways to score VP, interesting action selection mechanism (the cube tower), multiple paths to victory. But it's lighter than those other Feld games I enjoy so much, and the cube tower didn't work as well as I'd hoped: in the second part of the game most of the time only one color cube was coming from the tower, with few or no cubes left in the game and few actions from which players could choose what to do. Also, the last round was a bit anticlimatic: with most islands pretty full already, there was little left to do with several actions. Plus, the game was sloooooow, although that may have been more the players than the game!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Create a random board, sized to player count. Place goods tiles on all the marked spaces. Players start by placing 2 ships onto the board. Place all cubes in groups onto the rondel on the board. Seed the cube tower with some cubes of every color. The board has spaces for brown (progress) and yellow (goods multiplier) tokens: fill according to player count.

The game is played over 5 rounds, each with 7 turns. Each turn, drop all cubes from the next color clockwise on the rondel. In turn order, players take a single action; may choose from any color of cube that came out of the tower. The number of action points equals the number of cubes of the color with the majority. Alternatively, collect gold coins = a third of the total number of cubes (round up). Actions may be supplemented by coins (each coin spent adds 1 AP). Actions:
- Blue: move ship 1 space orthogonally; if arrive at island port, place settlement there (if space available). First placement on an island earns you 3VP.
- Black: buy cannons, used to fight pirates at the end of each round
- Red: buy building tiles, max 1 public (neutral). These are in a variety of shapes, bigger ones costing more AP. 
- Brown: advance on the brown track. If you reach one of the 5 marked spaces, take a brown tile; these are single-use or provide ongoing benefits during the game
- Green: place building tiles, paying AP as needed. These are placed onto empty spaces orthogonally adjacent to any of your houses or previously placed tiles, or to neutral tiles orthogonally connected to one of these. If placing onto one of the biggest islands, score the larger VP value printed. If covering a goods token, take it. If completing an island, score VP based on the round of the game and the number of your houses on the island (more houses, earlier round scores more)
- Yellow: spend AP to take yellow tile(s). These are multipliers matching the types of goods. At the end of the game, each goods type scores VP = (number of goods) x (1 + number of multipliers collected)
- White: advance on the turn order track, up to the number of AP spent. If you're on a color space, in the future you may use a white cube as that color if no others of that color are present.

At the end of each round, reveal a random pirate token, strength 0-4. Each player fights the pirates (strength = sum of all tokens revealed so far) by spending as many cannons. If they don't have enough, they lose VP. Replenish the yellow and brown tokens for next round.

At the end of the game, score VP for goods tokens, and for how far you've progressed on the white and brown tracks. Most VP wins!

RATING: 6
I'm just completely enthralled by the mechanics of Stephan Feld games (most of the time, the coin flipping experiment in Builder's Duel was god-awful!).  This time it is this nifty cube tower.  There are seven phases in each game round and each phase a color of cubes (representing the 7 actions that can be taken in the game) is dropped into a cube tower with a bit of a labyrinth inside that catches some.  So not everything you drop in comes out and sometimes you knock other cubes that were stuck in the tower out as well.  What comes out dictates which actions can be taken that turn.

The rest of the game is a typical Feldian "victory point salad" as I've heard it been called.  You can establish posts on islands and build there, collect goods and production tiles, collect special power tiles, and a few other things all in service of getting the most vee-pees.  While this starts to feel samey for a lot of game players it's usually the unique mechanics that sell it for me and I really do like this labyrinthine dice tower.

Granted, it is nice when it works, and it doesn't always work like you expect/want it to.  Sometimes everything you put in will come right back out, which is a little uninteresting.  And it's rare for a cube to be stuck in there for too many turns so you usually see a selection of actions from just the past two or three phases.  Plus a jostle to the table will cause additional cubes to fall out out-of-turn.

The components are also really nice though, it comes in this big box to separate and store everything nicely and it has thick tiles that make up a modular board as well as a nicely made frame to corral the tiled board without them slipping across the table.  Also, for a big box with a LOT of stuff the game was reasonably inexpensive (I was actually surprised by how big the box was for its price).

Pretty game with an interesting gimmick and decent gameplay behind it wins me over most of the time.

Not this time though.  I want to love this game but I just can't.  It looks amazing and the cube tower is a really neat new thing (I never played Wallenstein/Shogun) but for one, the cube tower doesn't work as good as I would like it to.  It can be altered but I'm usually pretty against making my own fundamental changes to a game to "fix" it.  But more importantly, there are a couple issues with actual gameplay.

For starters, most games begin with each player taking the same actions which isn't very interesting.  Even after players start to diverge there is still often an optimal action to take on any given turn and there will be a lot of turns where all players do the same thing back to back.  Even more egregious though is how little there ends up being to do on the last couple rounds.  By the end of the game all the islands are settled, developed, and drained of their resources so there's nothing to do with all those action points.  I spent every one of my final round actions last game just collecting gold because there was nothing better to do.  Not very fun.

It was suggested to me by another player in that game that the maps should actually be increased to the size for the next highest player total (so play on the 4-player map setup for 3 players for example).  Sure this would make it so players wouldn't be left without any actions on the final round but this would probably also kill the competition that is actually tense and exciting during early game rounds.  I think the flaw is in the design, everything you do is so interwoven that you spend the whole game taking all the possible actions you can and are left with nowhere else to focus by the end of the game.  This also makes it so there aren't a variety of paths to take to victory and the winner is often decided and apparent before the end of the game.

RATING: N/A
A classic Feld game with many options to get VP's. Lots of small inside tables and grids in which players grow getting their abilities improved. 

The novelty is mainly the tower action system. It's a very clever idea and the thing I would enlighten the most in this game. However, it sure has some issues, in my opinion, as it doesn't work perfectly during the entire game. Sometimes, given the randomness (intended) the number of cubes and available actions are not really an important and relevant choice as players tend to choose the obvious. A game with more than 30 action rounds and maybe only 10 of these present a challenge to decide something for, it's not enough to be considered solid.

Also, the building action, seems to be the one to go for as it gives some important VP and allow to get the goods that will serve as a multiplier in the end, maybe increasing the relevance of getting them (goods) to an unbalanced status among other strategies. Players must get these multipliers and be very sharp about this, as they are far more relevant than the other scorings.

Although I played the game once only, I got the impression that it does not give the same chances to all strategies. In my experience, the game ended with 2 players running far up front with the other 2 players staying far behind, with more than 50 VP's gap between. And both runaway leaders went for the goods multiplier strategy so, it seemed quiet symptomatic.

Feld with almost a theme - and a faulty tower

Much better with 3 than 2 as there is some competition for space and tiles so turn order becomes more important. I imagine i will prefer with 4.

Donna likes the game so it's a keeper.

To make the game interesting work try  this with the tower

Somehow a game that I should have loved - it's got the Shogun CUBE TOWER(!!), sailing around and settling islands using Tetris-shaped buildings, pirates, and the Shogun CUBE TOWER(!!) - ended up being a big, bloated, bore.  As has been my experience with other Feld games, there's just WAY too many details and mechanisms mashed together, with the usual added insult of slapping the players for not doing a specific action each round (this time in the form of pirates).  I'd really like to see that cube tower mechanism used in an interesting manner again (only Feld could turn the cube tower into a Mancala game), but meanwhile, I'm not anxious to play this one again.  In fact chances are high that, before setup was even finished, I'd be Amerigone...  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4/10

RATING: 6
Feld's twist on the cube tower is a simple action-selection mechanism: the colours that come out determine available actions, the largest quantity of a single colour the number of action points.

The disappointing part is that the cube tower is by far the weakest part of the design. It's just a little too random and too hard to plan: I would be very strongly inclined to rip the best part of Macao (the windrose) out of that design and use it here. The combination could be one of Feld's best games: the rest of the gameplay is more focused than anything he has released in a long time. Players sail around the islands building settlements and picking up goods, with other actions devoted to engine-building and to acquiring scoring multipliers for those goods. The spatial component of building (and blocking!) works very well indeed.

A good game that could have been a great one.

There are a few problems I have with it (not huge on spacial tile placing and there could be a decent amount of AP based on point calculation).

It is neat to have a push-your-luck aspect in a euro game. Just not sure exactly how I like the cube tower for that since sometimes cubes get stuck and never come out again.

Was okay.  Nothing wrong with the game necessarily.  A lot of down time, not a lot of planning, had to react more to the cubes that fell.  In particular only buying 1 neutral tile was a bit frustrating.  Would give it another shot, but have many other games i'd prefer to play before this one.

This game has a few things going for it.
1. It has a wonderful flow and could play out very quickly with a little experience
2. The rush of ship movement/exploration works is very cool.
3.The cube tower thing works well enough.
4.The blocking that can happen on the bigger islands makes for an interesting races.

On the downside the planning phase seems completely pointless and the whole pirate/cannon thing is so eurogame that I can't help but cringe. The major standout problem though is that the game is 1 (or 2) turns too long which makes it far less interesting than it could be.
The whole package just feels a little meh once everyone has finished with claiming the ports. It becomes a game of moving up tracks and collecting tokens which is not all that fun at the end of the day.

Point salad with a wonky cube tower.  It's extremely fiddly, and it's remarkable how much variance occurs related to how the cubes are dropped into the tower (variance in terms of numbers of cubes dropped - I can demonstrate a drop that leaves ~5 cubes in the tower vs one that leaves 15-20 cubes in the tower on average simply by changing how the cubes are dropped).  Game seems to last about 1 round too many in most games I've played.  Overall decent game, and I'll play it if the majority of a group wants to play, but it's definitely not my favorite Feld by a mile - much closer to my least favorite.

RATING: 7.5
Since [person=4958][/person] is one of my favorite designers, I had to play this as soon as possible. And the cube tower is a very cool piece of equipment that I always wanted to see in more games, and used differently that only for combat resolution. So what better designer to give this mechanism to than Feld? Indeed, the way he used the tower in this game is great. It's a luck factor, but it doesn't have huge swings, it's more or less predicable, but the great thing is that it does give players some surprises every now and then. And that adds some tension which I enjoy to this phase of the game.
This game is a bit of a point-salad-light. There are a few different ways to score points, but not not as many as in - say - [thing=102680][/thing], but it seems like there's still a couple of different strategies to pursue and try out.
I've enjoyed my first plays of this game quite a bit and I'm considering adding it to my collection.

Nice! Modular board (though it has the awful surround the board jigsaws like Catan, these fit well). Though pirates play a peripheral role in Amerigo, this is a game worth playing, unlike many pirate-themed games. The game uses a cube tower, like Wallenstein and Shogun; while, as usual, some cubes get lost for the entire game, and it is impossibly to risk manage since probabilities cannot be determined for the tower, since the tower results are used for all players, it's not odious, as I find it in the other two games.

I am usually a big fan of Stefan Feld, but this game seem to me it was not developed enough... maybe not enough playtest? Most of the choices are obvious and there are very limited strategies. Maybe my expectations were too high, after all the buzz about the game.

I love turn angst and games that keep punishing you (In the year of the dragon). Amerigo seemed too easy. Cannons were the only thing you needed to worry about, so big deal. Just spread your outposts quickly and try to match those good tiles with their related bonus tiles. 

Cube tower was an interesting mechanic, but at least for us it mostly just provided too many options on what to do. And most decisions were obvious. I want my games to be either much more cutthroat or exciting or just plain fun. Amerigo isn't, despite the fact it's a solid game. Not Feld enough for this Feld fan.

A very good game with nice components and a nice feel to it. I just love the "cube tower" that randomizes what kind of actions you can chose between each turn and to what extent. It's not completely random though as you always know what colour the cubes have that you drop through the tower. After getting the expansion "Amerigo Queenie 2: Cove Island, Bay Island & New Progress Tokens" the game got more variation to it which made me bump the grade up from 8 to 8.5.

The game scales perfectly from 2 to 5 players which is a big plus for me.

A lighter Feld action selection game, though you wouldn't know it with all of the components this game comes with! I enjoy the cube tower that determines which actions are available to players each turn, though the game is more satisfyingly difficult when you modify the tower to restrict the cubes a little more.

RATING: 6
A merely OK race-to-discover-and-build game that is playable if uninspired. The main gimmick here is a cube tower that theoretically drops a mix of cubes each round that determine the available actions. In practice, though, we had many, many rounds in which the only color to come out the tower was the one dumped in that round, limiting the action choices and creating some very boring turns.

First Impression:

A good euro with above average interaction and some novel mechanics.

Altough most actions give vps, it's easier to put goals in this game as the mechanisms are more clear. The action restricting (or should I say allowing?) tower is great and creates tough decisions, and the map creates ample opportunities to block your oponents and (try to) monopolise resources.

In general the game is unispiring, and although there are interesting decisions the theme is yet again almost absent and dry.

I enjoyed Amerigo more than most Feld games and I'd gladly play it again, but it's still not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Fun euro game themed around exploring and developing the isles in the Americas. The game revolves around the use of the cube tower, and it works well. The end game is just a bit on the underwhelming side, but the journey is so much fun.

Another fun Feld game right? I mean does this guy do no wrong? Hell if he's going to be prolific it at least he is consistent with good games. Beats other designers who churn out product after product only to find it's the exact same game with a new theme and a single little rule change...I'm looking at you Reiner....I'm looking at you. 

UPDATE: This is a very interactive game for Feld it's not qutie as do your own thing as so many of his other designs tend to be. That being said keep it in mind if you don't like games with dickery this might not be the one for you...as for me I'm moving it up to an 8 from a 7 because of this.

Perhaps it's better with 3 or 4 but honestly I really quite like it at 2 just fine. The board scales down so you can still get in the way of the other player, and steal resources from under their nose. Yep, I like it just fine with 2 players.

RATING: 5
Before I even played this game I've been on a rollercoaster of whether I liked this game or not. Initially being excited, then losing interest during the kickstarter, revamping excitement after watching a run through and finally coming out with mixed feelings after hearing a lot of negativity.

It's a little on the lighter side of things for me, but still interesting. I like a lot of things about the game. First and foremost the variability of setup. Our game had a lot of large islands and almost no pirates until the end... I think things would have played a lot differently if that had been reversed. And I really like the cube tower.

One thing I don't love is that during certain phases of the game, there are actions that are just worthless. Specifically towards the end of the game, navigation was pointless. And yes there is a mechanism to convert useless actions to gold, but it's still a drawback for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Some contrived decisions here. You get points for filling an island up with buildings, and more points the faster you do it. So naturally you want to grab the [i]smallest[/i] islands since they need less to fill up. Except, that you get double points while building on a "large" island (islands of size beyond a certain threshold). So you have to weigh that.

When preparing buildings to build, your personal supply costs 1 action point no matter the supply. There's also a bank that costs quite a bit more, and you can only buy one per turn. So naturally you want to use up your personal supply first. Except, that you get more points when [i]building[/i] the ones from the bank. So you have to weigh that.

Goods and their corresponding production tiles are just points.

Why do I get points for advancing on tracks that already provide advantages? Does buying my way up a track need to be its own "path to victory"? My issue is that this artificial importance doesn't create interesting dilemmas so much as arithmetic to be solved.

As far as the theme goes, I like the sailing around and claiming the limited ports where you can build trading posts, and building buildings in order to claim the limited supplies of goods. But the points come fast and furious from all over the place that I don't know whether the stuff I like is actually the focus of the game.

It plays with a nice rhythm, turns not taking too long. The only thing I don't like there is when you take the action that lets you prepare to place buildings, you have to pick those buildings out, but you don't put them on the board. Then when you take the action to actually build those buildings, you have to remember what on earth you were thinking of doing. It would be better if the "plan" action let you rack up credit on a building track so that you could decide just once what you're building where.

If your dice tower tends towards diarrhea, the game is nearly broken by turn order inflexibility: Everyone mostly will only be able to take the same action on each phase, and that includes improving one's place in turn order. Turn order is important especially due to the fact that production buildings can be easily bought up so that somebody late in turn order can't buy any and doesn't have another action choice either.

In contrast to Macao there seems to be much less of a feeling that different players will want to take different actions. That's kind of disappointing.

...Flipping the floors in the tower does seem to make a major difference. I actually had a turn where nothing came out of the tower. This would probably mitigate the complaints that players run out of things to do well before the game ends.

...After playing with some variants I'm tempted to up .5 to 7.0. Feld was nice enough to design the actions so that only one of them absolutely must involve gaining points (the production building action). Everything else can be a means to an end. So it's possible to have a(n even) smoother-playing game focused on the race for limited resources on the board.

However, I still think turn order inflexibility is a real issue. One could give even more gold to the later players, but I'd prefer a fix that somehow makes turn order more dynamic.

RATING: 8
Out of the box: Typical learning curve for a mid-weight Euro; no big hitches in learning or setting up. Very quick pace, both in turn length and the overall arc of the game. Hints of CoB (filling out small spaces early in the game can score big, gold option redeems a bad "roll" here like the worker option does in Castles), but only hints. Our third Feld game, and it looks like it will reach the high expectations we have of him.

After a few more plays: Maybe not quite the range of options of other Feld games? Seems that certain configurations can lead to rich-get-richer scenarios. Not sure. Still, very fun, nice little subtleties in the way the systems interlock, and the cube tower is a great mechanism. 

Later, after several more plays: House rule: we remove the tile that lets you force your opponents to shoot 2 more pirates. It's a HUGE take-that moment in a game that has nothing else like that--very swingy and unfair, we feel. That tile will not come back in our games. Other than that, we like this game very much, and it's in steady rotation.

Every blue/movement step we throw in all the cubes into the cube tower to increase options later on, as they seem to narrow as the full round proceeds.

This may not be the best Feld to date (I like the more focused games like In The Year Of The Dragon, Notre Dame and Die Speicherstadt better), but I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is more a game like Trajan, but less of a brainburner, and therefore more accessible. The board and bits are great and turns go pretty fast. The last round scores relatively few points, so be sure to start cashing from the beginning. No need to own the game yet, but sure would be willing to play again.

Very interesting concepts in the game and the mechanics should work very well, but the cube tower seemed to not work for us as it really didn't create random choices.  Nearly every cube put in came out with typically 0-1 other cubes.  I would say 80%+ of the time the tower remained empty after dropping.  There also seems to be a scaling issue.  At 2-3 people islands are tighter and there are fewer large islands.  With 4 it is very easy for one person to run away or block off entrance points to a large island.  Also, if the theme is settling islands, we had one person who really didn't settle much land at all and instead used two upgrades for gold in the first two rounds to simply turn nearly every drop into extra gold and victory points and narrowly missed winning the game by basically not playing the game.

(Nov 15, 2013 - after 1 4p game)   5 Rounds, 7 action spots per round = 35 actions and opportunities to score  VPs.   This is a VP salad game - but I like them so this is a good one for me.

Variable board set up, extra tiles (expansion) and variable "brown gear" abilities make this one have infinite replayability as long as it does not get too "samey".  Time will tell.  I know I'll get at least 10-20 plays out of it, which is a hit in my book.

Be careful with AP players.   They will have 35 opportunities to min/max their options.   If we can get this down to 90-120 minutes, then I will be very happy.

A favorite among feld games because it is most unfeld-like. The cubes, the boats and the map break the cycle of

Good medium-weight euro with a unique action selection mechanism. Yet another solid Feld game that offers many interesting decisons - playing it was a really pleasant experience.

I have some problems with Amerigo though. First off, the box size is ridiculous (and that's really an issue if you are trying to save your shelf space). The artwork is bland and it's very easy to mix up certain colours. The biggest drawback is that there's not much left to do in the final round and players are just going through the motions (or at least my group felt so during our first play - further plays will tell if we were right).

Still, despite all that I really enjoyed this game and I would gladly give it another try, there are quite a few strategies I would like to explore. I would recommend Amerigo to anyone who likes tactical, puzzly, but not overly complex euros.

Could this be my favourite Feld? it could, togtheter with Rialto. Feld is a great author but his games are too complicated and filled with tiny bits of everything that take ages to be set up: the games are very good but i am not attracted to them very much. Rialto and now Amerigo are different. Amerigo is still very long to be set up: creating a correct map is a game in the game, not an easy one. But the flow of the game is wonderful, rules aren't that complicated and the game itself is really good, somehow original and with very very tough and interesting decisions. I hope to play it again soon and my rating could also raise.

The main mechanic of dropping cubes into the tower and having that determine which actions are available sounds cool in theory, but in practice, not enough cubes get stuck in the tower to ever create a sense of urgency. This means the goals in this game are quite easy to get. 

Apart from this quirky mechanic there's really nothing else in the game that's innovative, even when you consider only other Feld games. The game borrows a number of (scoring) mechanics from Castles of Burgundy but uses them in a less exciting way, which makes me wonder what's the point of rehashing them at all.

Almost every time the optimal move was very obvious to all players, which makes gameplay fairly uninteresting. I'm not saying it's a bad game per se, but if you own Castles of Burgundy, you won't feel like you need this one. Amerigo felt very 'meh' to me, and didn't challenge or excite me.

[-]Have received lots lower end game offers for Amerigo as a 1 to 1 trade. To me, that is kinda of off-putting.
So I am writing in these comments as to what I expect if I am going to be trading Amerigo to you.

I will not let this go for less than 2 games and both should be (1 at least) at my Wishlist(1) spot. For 2 reasons.

1. Limited supply high demand.
This game is only available online as a pre-order, anywhere. I bought the only copy at my FLGS, and none of my other FLGS's have it on there distro list for shipping in Dec. 
Your FLGS may have it and if so why are you looking to trade for it... eh? ;)

2. Large retail box, think Eclipse or Exodus sized.
Shipping cost will be close to 1 game, so min of 2 games, to make it worth the trade.

I am also selling this and can ship ASAP for the holidays.[/-]

Being a Feld fan, this is high on my list, and plays great. For my tastes.

Certainly not his heaviest game on complexity.

The cube tower and action selection is fun. I always like games with modular board.

One of my favorite Feld games.  Of course all of his games are great because he always has some type of unique mechanic.  This one is no different with the use of the cube tower.  I have played this with several people who enjoy Euro games and they all love how the cube tower is used to direct players into what actions they may use that turn.  You never know what might come out but you always know the probability is high that you will get to play the action of the color you drop in.  It is interesting that the game is about exploration of a new world and new lands.  I feel like the theme really shines here because you feel like you are exploring different paths to victory and never quite know what may come of your journey (based on the cube tower mechanic and your personal choices).  In my first two games, the pirates were pretty much a non existent threat until the last round.  However, in my last game, the pirates were at a stronger strength throughout the game.  I found that I enjoy the game more when the pirates are strong from the start.  It adds a much higher level of tension.  There are some obvious beginning of the game strategies to pursue but you are always wanting to build and explore new lands.  I greatly enjoy the Tetris style land pieces that make you think abstractly as you play.  This game is also interesting because you can choose to play off on your own or battle it out with your opponents for land spaces.  It is rewarding and smart to get involved in your opponents larger islands if you can so that they don't score as many points, but this could cause some confrontation between players if you play with people who are easily offended.  Overall, a great game!

Good game that nicely incorporates a cube tower for action selection. The mechanism makes tha planning and strategising in this game really tense and you always have to gamble, which cubes might come out and which might not. 
Also the map is huge and great to look at and the slow building of the tiles make you feel like you really did something during the game.

No es de los imprescindibles de Feld, pero para jugarlo muy de vez en cuando merece la pena.

I don't think the cube tower work well with this game.

2013-11-11: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Good replay value, and the fickle nature of the tower can give you some interesting challenges; unfortunately, it also can give everyone cruddy options, which speeds the game along, but in an unthrilling way.  Still, on the whole, I like the way this mechanism works for the game.

2013-11-30: [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] There's plenty of replayability in this, but the game is anticlimactic.  The excitement builds for the first few rounds, but by the end, you're just gliding as far as you can on mostly obvious choices.  A bigger map could mitigate this somewhat, but I think it would still peter out at the end, perhaps later, perhaps less, but still anticlimactic.

2013-12-04: [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] Although the varying islands and pleasantly obnoxious action cubes provide plenty of replay value, I sadly find that I enjoy this game less every play.  It pretty much boils down to this procedure over the course of the game:  Race to place as many outposts as possible, because if you have significantly fewer placement opportunities than your mates later in the game, you've already lost.  Then (possibly overlapping with the race for outposts), scarf up as many matching goods and production tiles as you can.  All the while, do a little of this and that to give yourself an edge via progress tiles.  Race anyone else on "your" islands to place the tiles you planned.  As the space to build dwindles, and the tiles available to you run out, the excitement shrinks and shrinks.  So, there are things I like [b]about[/b] the game, but I don't think I like the game.

Subtracted half a point each for 1) the fiddly set up and 2) the questionable tower construction.  Not a bad game overall, but this is one of Feld's weaker efforts.  Replace the cubes with dice somehow and get rid of the gimmicky tower, and this would have been a much better game.

Oh, and feel free to subtract another .25 for the size of the box if you're so inclined.  It did NOT need to be that damn big.

Érdekes volt az egész és egyáltalán nincsenek rossz emlékeim róla, de nem vágyom további ismeretségre vele. A "dicetower" ötletes, jó az akcióválasztás mechanizmusa, de vhogy nekem mégse lett kedvenc.

Eh, this game just sort of fell flat for me. There were no individual mechanics that grabbed my interest, and the game as a whole didn't stand out from the crowd.

Game is kind of dependent on what technology tiles come up and who manages to snatch them up. I still enjoy it though.

Me and my wife love the worker placement/tower element here. Always a good game, although I always lose.

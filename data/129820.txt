Decent deck builder. It's basically a racing game with a deck-building element. It's more of an intro into deck building with more of a theme and "take that" factor than Dominion. I don't think it's as much fun in the long run as Dominion though, since there's not that much variation.

Fun deck-building/racing game.  (Frankly, I'm surprised FF didn't get here first!)  Good length on the game, and the graphic design is pretty nice.  I'm happy that they built in so much replayability.  It may not rock the gaming world, but I was happy to have played it.

Pretty simple to teach and play. Some luck involved in what cards you draw and hoping they meet your needs. Modular board design is neat and allows for a lot of interesting combinations. Not overly challenging and leaves a little to be desired. Nice filler game but we never played it much so we ended up trading this one away.

RATING: 6
I like racing games more than most people, so I feel like I might rate this a point or two higher than many people would.

Overall, the idea of deck-building in a racing game seems pretty cool, and for the most part, it is.  The main issue with adding cards to your deck is that sometimes you have a choice of whether to add a move straight, left, or right card to your deck, and there's really no way to plan for what you'll need in a given situation later in the race.  So, it ends up feeling a little like a crap shoot what to take.

Other than the novelty of deck-building, everything else is pretty straight-forward once you get past the terribly written and super redundant rule book (the rule book is at least a full page longer than it needs to be, and yet has some confusing parts that aren't explained well).  You play cards, either moving your salmon or triggering some other effect based on the card played.

The game is a race, so of course the first salmon to make it up river to the spawning grounds wins!

Deckbuilder-meets-race game. Suffers by comparison to Dominion but substantially better than most post-Dominion deckbuilders. It's quite light but there's room for strategy. It's OK.

For a kickstarter game, this one is a surprisingly decent deck building race game.  I especially like how the river can be made longer or shorter depending on how long of a game you want.  It has come in very handy when bedtime was approaching and we were only halfway through.

RATING: 7
Dominion meets a river grid with a goal to get to the top.  Family game with 8 to 16-year-olds involved.  

To be fair, I need to try this one a few more times.  My initial reaction is that it's a good game with an interesting theme.  Some mechanics are a little confusing, but manageable.  I played with 2, but it probably is ideal with 3 or 4.  

It feels like you can't get through your cards fast enough to have a significant effect on deck building (both good and bad).  The whole effect of having cool cards is muted.  It's like there should be an ability to pick up more cards or reduce the variety or something.  Also, when a fish breaks away to the front, there's not enough power to stop them.  

I gave it a 7, but it's probably a 6.

Rated after sixteen plays.  While I typically weigh in the family's overall reactions to games I introduce, this rating is all my own.

As of the end of May '13, my wife and I have been playing board games regularly for close to five months.  In that time our collection has grown from a handful of family games to close to 40 enjoyable choices for our game nights.  

Of all the games we have played thus far, Salmon Run has produced some of the greatest game plays we have shared together; tense, challenging, and hilariously cut throat.

Please don't hate me, my Euro loving cousins -- but Salmon Run is a game after my own heart.

RATING: 5
A race game with a deck building element.   The race portion isn't all that interesting, and the deck building element less so.   I applaud the effort at implementing this theme, but it doesn't quite work.   Bears don't eat my fish, they just make them tired?   The problem is that many of the elements of the game (and many of the cards) don't really have significant in-game effects.   Just swim for the finish.   This is a great example of the kind of underdeveloped, inexperienced, unpolished Kickstarter games that are now flooding the market.   The production is decent, I'll give it that - but that's because the publisher is experienced.

Really nice game which mixes a race with a deck building game.

You need to balance how fast you swim with which cards to add to your deck to allow you to swim further in the later half of the race.

It is possible, although difficult, to win without altering your deck at all.

One of the starting boards has a bear within 2 spaces of the start location therefore we have house ruled no bears on turn one as otherwise first player has quite the advantage.

It's a stretch to call this a deck builder. You have very little control over what actually ends up in your deck; certainly not enough control to build a strategy around. The gameplay in generally is about at the level of many Kickstarter games. Some good ideas, but ultimately not very good execution. Another 100 hours of play testing and this probably could have been a very good game.

Azt vártam tőle, hogy egy könnyed ám mégis agyalós deckbuilding lesz, ami jobb mint a friedman friese hasonló játéka. De sajna nem jött be a várakozás. Könnyednek könnyed, de annyira, hogy gyakorlatilag nincs benne döntési helyzet. Deckbuildingról se nagyon lehet beszélni, mert kb. 4-5 új lapot tudsz szerezni a játékban, amiknek ráadásul jó része értelmetlen. Kár érte, mert alapból a mechanizmusok, és a rendhagyó téma miatt jónak tűnt... :(

Neat game, and pretty fun but seems kind of a simple fish race mostly. Generally when racing up the river it is almost always a pretty close race. I've added the fisherman expansion which adds a little more to it. Your fish stands up on the river (like it's being caught), but lucky fish - it gets to shake lose and swim on up river, although maybe slightly behind. Jumping into the fish pond at the end of the race is where you bog up a bit. There's 100s and 100s of possible river combinations you can play which give it a lot of variation. I've enjoyed it a lot when I can talk someone into playing it.

Two plays. Decent fun if you're in the mood for something simple & easy. Avoid the temptation to make a long, difficult course; everyone will have lots of "take that" cards, the fatigue will start to rack up, and the game will basically grind to a halt an inch before the finish line.

Quite the pleasant surprise!  Salmon Run is a fast moving racing game that uses deck building to great effect.  The need to cycle through your deck helps keep things tight by allowing others to catch up, but there does also seem to be some real strategy at play.  There are opportunities to mess with your opponents, but not so much that it hinders the feel-good vibe of the game.  The most fun I've had with a new game in a while.  

UPDATE: The second time around was much more ehh.  I think this one needs the right group to work.

I really liked this game.

Light deck building game in a Mississippi Queen-type of racing track.  Well designed modular boards adds to re-playability.

Deck building aspect is "light" from the standpoint that there are not super-complex card interactions that are found in many deck-builders - which makes the game fairly family-friendly.  Also, with "shorter" stream lay-outs, tactical play will trump extensive effort to optimize one's deck.

A racing game is add deck building mechanic on it. Unlike classic racing game, Salmon Run has more interaction between players. There are several diversionary cards and factors in the game, for instance, bears, eagles, current, fatigue and etc. These kinds of disturbances make the game into chaos. On the contrary, the game system let players feel tight throughout playing game. Salmon Run never provides invigorating feeling while advancing player's pawn. The game has tried to combine interesting mechanics together to make a highly sophisticated racing game. The idea and the attempt are admirable. Simultaneously, Salmon Run has lost intrinsic strong points as a racing game. The game, Salmon Run, is not my cup of tea.

I tend to enjoy deck-building games and I like the ones that add a little more to it than just the cards.  Salmon Run adds just enough theme and board elements to make the experience a pretty good time.  I like that each game can be different based on how the board is set up and how cards come out and are used.  At the end of the day, it's nothing great, but it's still enjoyable.

I really wanted to like this game. I like deck-building as a mechanism, and I especially appreciate a unique (non-SF/Fantasy) theme. However, it doesn't feel like there are very many interesting choices to make and not enough challenge.

Played a pre-release copy.  This game was not my cup of tea.  Part of the problem was the amount of randomness and limited choices the game provides.  Yeah, I suppose the river could be simulated this way, but it did not make it a fun game.  Perhaps if I had more of a choice when landing on a spot it might have given me some additional opportunity to strategize versus being a tactical game the whole way.  There was no rhyme or reason as to why the symbols were located in the places they were on the board.  Also, I didn't really feel I got good use of my deck as the game was over far too quickly.  Methinks house-ruling that you discard your hand (and a larger hand at that), might help things out.  Was this really play-tested??

If you enjoy Robo-Rally, with a minuscule level of choice you might like this game.  Me?  Meh, not so much.  I'd play if someone was dying to check it out, but it's not one that deserves to be in my collection.

Thematic deck builder. You are a salmon attempting to get to the spawning pond and do so by playing swim cards from your hand. On your turn you get 3 cards you can play. If you play 3 swim cards you take a fatigue, (equal to a wound in Marvel Legendary). Otherwise you move the space as shown on the river map. If you ever pass through a space on the map with a symbol you get that type of card and put it into your deck. Play is quick and intuitive, but you can get stuck in some parts of the map if you don't draw the correct card. The theme makes this one fun.

My first game actually would cause me to rate this a 4 or 5 as the current cards were owned by one player with no fatigue and he kept pulling us back as he banged his head against a narrow passage.  Painful experience I do not wish to repeat.  However, I think there is still quite a bit of interesting aspects to this game that I do want to explore more, but I will be more conscious of current card opportunities.  Fatigue cards can really be painful in this game as you acquire them by doing too much in a turn or getting in the way of a bear and they clog one's hand.  There is a small aspect of deckbuilding as you travel the stream you acquire cards of the type of icon you go over along the way.

What I like:
- Race game without a ton of attacks
- Beautiful modular board
- Reasonable deck management mechanisms

What I don't like:
- Hand size, card play, and waterfall rules are frustrating
- Still more attacks than I prefer
- High randomness led to an easy winner

Only being able to play 2-3 swim cards out of 4 is frustrating, and ending up with useless hands is really frustrating. Losing a few turns due to not having the right cards, or to discarding fatigue can easily lose you the game. 

I think the 1.9 voted weight is about right. Our learning game took 40 minutes, which was reasonable. I would much rather play Roll to the South Pole.

A fun way to combine deck building with a board.  And the hex spots on the board, combined with the cards you draw each turn, give the player options to choose from.

- This is a fun deck building game where you use your cards to move your salmon(fish meeple) up the river. There are multiple options to move forward, but to win before everyone else you are usually taking the three movement action. Also, playing more boards is better.

Kind of a deck building game which helps you race up the stream.  Feels like it plays itself a bit.

Rating of 7 based on one 2 player game. Rating will probably change after more plays, I'm inclined to say it will go down. Not a bad game by any means, but not all that exciting either. I think they should have designed it with players starting with more fish and the bear kills the fish instead of just giving the player a fatigue card. Maybe that wouldn't work, but it just seems like there isn't enough "take that" in the game.

Update: Dropped rating to a 5. Game is just not exciting enough. Needs more take that element.

A fun racing game with a fantastic theme (seriously, a salmon's last spawning voyage is an epic adventure, indeed), a modular board for replay value, and an interesting card-based race system, with some light deckbuilding for good measure.  

As your salmon-meeples move up the river, you'll gain special action cards as well as useless "fatigue" cards.  Take too much fatigue and soon your deck will be clogged, slowing you to a glacial pace while your opponents ride the rapids, dodge the bear, and leap the waterfall to victory!   

The game plays well with 2 to 4 players and provides an exciting race.  There are a few wonky rules, and the rulebook could use streamlining and a graphical overhaul, but overall this is a solid little racing game.  The theme absolutely makes it for me.

The game probably isn't quite a 7 in game play as it is a fairly simple deck builder but the them bumps it, for me, up to a 7 from a 5/6 as I found it very fitting and fun!

Fun, cleverly designed game with lots of theme. I don't mind the randomness, since it's a light, fairly quick play and does generate some of that excitement and cheering that a race game is all about. You don't cycle through deck maybe as much as you'd like, but overall a winner.

Annoying and unclear rules make this gateway game one that will turn new gamers off. As an experienced gamer, the rules are fiddly.

Too bad, it can be fun. Games are too often determined by rule uncertainty.

For me this falls into the wide selection of games that is good but not great. This game works well, it plays at the right temp, and it is fun enough. However, it did nothing to really stand out for me either. I have played much more engaging deck building games and I have played much more engaging racing games. I do like the challenge of trying to read the river board and plot the best course. I will play this game, but I fear it may spend a lot of time collecting dust as it gets passed up for other games consistently.

Deck builder first and foremost mixed with a bit of random tile. The river is different each time, so you have to think of a new plan each play. Plus, the cards depend on how you move. Neat game.

Nice little racing game.  The short easy games are a bit lackluster. In order to get the full experience you need to play with a longer more difficult set-up. Otherwise you don't actually get to see much happen to your deck and you don't feel the burden of the fatigue cards.  

I wish there was more accessible way to tailor your deck a bit though.

Decent family fun. The deckbuilding is kind of random but it does a good job of introducing the mechanic to younger players. There is just the right amount of player interaction to make it fun for me and not to much for the rest of the family :)

The combination of deck building and racing board game blends well, yet it doesn't turn out exactly exciting for me. The rules seem a bit overly complicated for what you get in the end. The board itself has different levels of difficulty, of course, we started with the easy one, hopefully the other levels add more suspense to the game play, it went too quickly I thought.
We played with only two players, there is a chance it works better with more which could change my rating.

A very fun combination of deck building and racing with a great level of player interaction. Be careful you don't get "bear"ed!

We kickstarted the game so we have the Fishermen Expansion (wooden die, extra boards, grizzly bear and bald eagle cards).

Maybe our favorite race game.

Nice combination of deck-building mechanic with the salmon racing theme.

Good family game.

Salmon Run is a great mix between a racing game and a deck builder. Being too aggressive will clutter your deck with fatigue cards. In that way you never feel that anyone has an insurmountable lead in the game.

I give it a six just to be fair.  I don't particularly like deck building games.  Was bored playing this and would turn down an opportunity to play again.  But I'm sure it's fine for what it is.  Others I'm sure will like it.  I did not.

Not fun at all! Lot of limitation and did not really build my deck. Repeating the same move many rounds... hard to finish it.

Why even bother getting together to game if you're not even going to interact with each other in the game itself?

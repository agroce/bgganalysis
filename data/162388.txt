The "folders" used to store character cards and tokens are a nifty idea, but do not work very well.

If I could give a game an 11, this whole series would be it. You'll never play every matchup available, storage is impossible without a custom setup, but man, it is SO worth it. If you have a passing interest in fighting games, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.

An outstanding bluffing game with a lot of depth, meta is deep in this one. Somehow it doesn't make me giggle inside, guess it has a lot to do with already having many duel games.

Gives the feel of an arcade fighting game without requiring you to learn a bunch of complex combos with an arcade stick.  Different matchups present very different challenges.  Fantastic game.

RATING: 9.5
The best 2P game that involves visceral movement and attacking on an one-dimensional battle field, which can lead to being blown over and mind-screwed by your opponent. I cannot get enough of this, and neither can anyone who I introduce it to. Doesn't get enough love from me simply due to the fact I play multiplayer games more often than 2P.

Haven't had the opportunity yet to mix characters from other boxes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A great, no-luck two player duel game. The rules are extremely intuitive and there seems to be plenty of depth to be found. The huge amount of characters and options give this game loads and loads of replayability. A very pleasant surprise and definitely recommended!

I don't like fighting video games because I'm not quick or clever enough to get good enough to enjoy them. Fortunately I can play this with people as terrible as me.

BattleCON captures the feel of that fighting game, predict your foe's moves with unique and varied fighters. The amount of information to keep in mind when playing is a little dense, but I imagine it becomes the upper end of manageable in time. It's got a fair barrier to entry, though.

Kickstarter. Haven't played all the characters yet, but giving this a solid 9 based on the characters played so far, BattleCON system, and what the suggested retail will be when it hits the streets. It's a good entry point with an approachable number of characters. Fate ended up being bonus content due to great funding in the Kickstarter. Seven of the 10 characters were player selected by voting. Due to this, some of them can be a little complex. This is both good and bad. Since new players will be likely to buy Fate first, the complex characters might be too confusing, however, it gives room for growth as a player learns. I'm not giving it a 10 due to a few things. 1) Misprint on Grasp card (no "2" on the bottom to indicate default suggested discard) can lead to new player confusion when they go through the tutorial. 2) No beat counters - this is something Devastation had that wasn't included in War Remastered or Fate and it should be there imo. 3) Typos in the rulebook that don't impact anything but just make it look less professional. 4) Box storage could be designed better. They had a long time to work on this, so I expected a large improvement over the storage in Devastation. It's only marginally better with character envelopes at least being able to fit in the storage slots. I expected better thought out tray design and component storage.

Overall, the art, component quality, and game play is great. New mechanics have been introduced to the system. The characters are interesting and varied. The smaller board and inclusion of cards that can be used as a board is a great thing for portability. Added note: Other misprints in the rulebook have me lowering the score.

The first small box (10 fighter) BattleCON set. Biggest surprise was the portable card-based board!

Fast, furious two-player fighting game reminiscent of 90s arcade games. The art style reminds me most of the Guilty Gear X series, a lesser known game similar to Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.

New characters are always welcome, but the rule changes and mismatched components are disappointing. I'm all-in now for a good digital adaption of this wonderful game. I really hope they can pull it off!

My desire to try every BattleCON character once sputtered out after a few experiments with Fate characters. Maybe it's just me, though; that was also when I got tons of BattleCON stuff from the Kickstarter, all at once, and nearly all of it has gone unplayed. So perhaps I just hit a wall.

The series continues strong with this excellent roster for a starter set. 
That said, I am bit worried that there seems to be slight tweaks every set--Burst changing, start positions changing, how finishers work... I like the iterative improvements, to be sure, but I'm hoping they're done with.

RATING: 8
This works as a stand alone game, but it feels more like a character expansion for Devastation.  I am happy with the content as an expansion.  If this was the only copy of BattleCon I had, I would have appreciated 2-4 more characters.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: A very clever dueling game, the basic mechanics are really simple but there is a ton of depth. Each character also feels really different from the others. In the scenario where you could perfectly outguess your opponent, this game has no luck whatsoever, and so outside of abstracts has one of the highest strategy to length ratio of any game I've played.

Some downsides to this game is being familiar what your opponent's character can do seems to be a really big advantage. I almost fear the day I get good at this game, as it will make playing with beginners potentially no longer fun. Also, there is a lot of different timing things that makes it easy to make mistakes of what occurs when.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Played for years, yet I am continuously amazed at this design. It's such a fluid fun puzzly good time, and each character is so unique.

If you are checking out Battlecon for the first time, War of Indines is right where you want to be.

I hesitated on getting this game at first and now I see why.  I am sure this is good for many, but I found the game to be long and painful to get through.  I knew up front this was no lightning fast game, but halfway through I was ready for the game to be over.  I will give it a couple more tries before moving this out of my collection, but my hopes are measured.

It's more BattleCON, and more BattleCON is a good thing. That being said, this particular set is probably the weakest produced thus far. It features a number of characters that are arguably a bit too complex, especially for new players. This is better for more experienced players.

Expected arrival: July 2015.

Not counting promotional characters, Fate of Indines will bring the total number of fighters in BattleCON series up to 58. For that alone, I am psyched. Hopefully, the smaller price tag will also help this act as a good introductory set to get new players into the game.

If you enjoy playing arcade or console fighting games (or have fond memories of such), you simply need to get your hands on a copy of BattleCON. Just like any fighter worth its weight, the system here rewards practice and mastery with the characters. This is the type of game that opens up the more you play it, and the wide cast of characters all bring something interesting to the table -- both mechanically and thematically. While a quick glance might suggest this game is of the Ameritrash variety, it certainly has the bite of a solid Euro in terms of play optimization. If there is one downside to this game, it would be that it is the bane of AP-prone players, especially when learning a new character. Regardless, this may be the pinnacle of fighting games and is a must if you're in the market for one. 

As a side note, I should quickly touch on Yomi, as the two often get compared because of their similar theme. Stated simply, these games play vveerryy differently. Yomi is a fine game in its own right and I still happily play it. It's also the easier game to get into it if you're looking for a nice entry point.

RATING: 9.1
It's good because it's BattleCON, but this one seems to have power creep issues relative to the other sets. Also, Level99 tried to put this together as a smaller starter set of characters, but most of them have more complex mechanics than the other sets. As such, I can't really recommend it as a starting point even if I like the cast okay; I think Devastation is still best in that regard, with War as an acceptable substitute for those with commitment or finance concerns.

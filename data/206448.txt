A quick simple area control cardgame. I have suggested it a few times, easy to travel with and great for taking out with you to restaurants when you are waiting on your meal.

Odd game that I would need to play a few more times. Placing your cards requires some strategic thinking.

RATING: 8
Components: good quality on cards in a small box
Complex: easy to teach, hard to learn
Weight: light to medium
Players: would say 3, 4 is good also
Length: less than 45 mins
Mechanics: city building, area control
Decisions: quite enough, should I place a syndicate, increase the city, protect what I have, cover that ugly guy....
Opinion: this has been a really nice surprise, you just get some cards in a small box, and then you have a great game.
The city is increasing, and you have to control as many zones as you can with your syndicates, this is the aim of the game.
On your turn you just play a card, replenish or draw and then the next one... you can place one of your syndicates, they are the ones who will help you gain zones, and they have their own hierarchy. What does this mean? that the higher ones can cover the lower ones, making that so clever movement from your opponent useless, and you can cover up to your master. The other option is to increase the city, it starts with just 2 cards, and this is not enough for all syndicates around, so you must put more building there, obviously close to your people.
And now I have to mention that there a couple of lovely cards, some with gears... this card allows you to mess everything around and move one card, and then the Police Station, arresting all syndicates adjacent to it by the end of the round.
In less than 45 minutes and a few cards you have a game full of tension and so many things happening, should I place now that Building close to my syndicate? or is better for me to cover that small syndicate out there. Wait!! I have this gear card here, which allows me to move the Police there and ruin your plans.
Seems that this will be a game that will go in my pocket many times

Pleasant filler game with an interesting evolution. 
Very good in 2p, but 3-4 players tends to be too much chaotic.

Cards game that introduce a new use of cards, i foud that it's a perfect filler.
Longevity it's guaranteed by the different neutral cards, furthermore I think it has good value for money.

This was a mixed bag for me. I really like parts of the game system. You all have identical decks, but draw them randomly. Cards from your deck have 1, 2, or 3 strength. The board is built from cards, there is a non-player deck that has cards which depict a city landscape, but mechanically they only have some icons on them. Each player has a favoured icon that they score 2 points for instead of the normal 1.

On your turn you can place one of your cards into the common tableau, or place one of the non-player cards from a display of 3. In this way the common tableau gets built. You control a non-player card if your strength in adjacent cards is higher than any other player's. 

You can cover an opponent's card with one of your cards if your card is higher rank. Perhaps surprisingly, I don't have a problem with this, it seems necessary to me to make the game more dynamic and to increase the interaction. It's a short game, so this type of interaction is acceptable. It adds an extra layer of strategy as you know your low rank cards are vulnerable.

This general sketch of the game is what I like. Then things start getting tricky. There are police cards among the non-player cards, all player cards adjacent to a police card are flipped face down and provide 0 strength. Okay a little harsh, but maybe that also adds to tactical play. The proverbial straw is that there are both player cards, and non-player cards that (in addition to being placed normally) allow you to move a visible card that's already in play. You can move an opponent's card, or a police card, you can even move a card on top of another card so long as it's of higher rank. 

It's hard to pin point exactly which of these things spoils the broth for me, but what could have been a wonderful tactical card game full of tough choices and compromises turns into a chaos monkey flinging one too many handfuls of negative player interaction. Trying to actually make good moves is somewhere between frustrating and pointless.

The game is close to being good, and I guess because of that it stings a little bit more.

Great small box game. Have good enough amount of things to think, whether to use the card to deny other player's majority or to explore and control new grounds. Like it.

Tile (card) placement and area majority. Weird. Very little control in a four player game. Perhaps better with two.

Played at Spiel 2016. First game we played and we had fun. So we bought it. It's a game you can easily take with you and do a quick play. Or as a warm up game.

A card laying system in order to score majorities. But with twists. You have to get into it, but once you do, this turns out to be quite a nice and quick filler.

Neat little card game. Need to play a few more times to see how it works but there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. The cog cards are important and have to be used carefully. I assum eplayers will try and hold on to them for end-game but sometimes it will be important to do it otherwise.

Colour choice for the 4 factions is not very good as orange and red are too close and so are green and blue. Strange choice. Nice artwork though.

Maybe better with 2, but with three it was way to chaotic - everything could make undone and there is huge kingmaker effect. Cant imagine it with four, as it must be even more chaotic.

No more than a filler, but a good, back-and-forth, tense, even nasty little card game. Plays quick, feels very tactical and did I mention nasty? Not immersed in Steampunk, but borrows it's often acerbic nature.

I don't see the appeal of this one at all.  It was very swingy without a lot of ways to mitigate it.  Nice art, but a couple of the colors were much to similar which I had a hard time with.

Don't be fooled by the small package because your brain will work hard to win this game. Beautiful yet simple art makes this spacial puzzle even more enjoyable and it's definitely one of those small pocket games that you can bring to the table anytime.

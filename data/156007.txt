I ultimately got rid of this because it was too long for what it was. I liked the theme because I grew up near the mounds discussed on some of the cards in this game. Ultimately, it is so dice dependent that I'd only want to play the game if it was 20-30 minutes, which this game isn't.

Adds a number of new twists to the States of Siege series and they come together very well. This game provides a great arc as you progress through the three ages, and also allows for your early decisions to reverberate throughout the entire game. The theme isn't as engaging as my touchstone of the States of Siege series, Cruel Necessity, but the game play of Mound Builders is as satisfying and enjoyable in 1/3 to 1/2 the time. This one is well done.

I don't know why a number of people have commented on the rule book negatively. It's a good, well-written rule book. It does require you to read it fully before playing, but all of the rules are there and are fairly easy to reference as you learn the game. Maybe it's a bit more opaque if this is your first States of Siege game, but I've had no issues with the rule book.

The first wargame I'm scoring. I really like VPG and this one stands out for me. The rules were confusing at times and at 30 pages are much longer and complex than the other games I have from VP Games. Plays quick with small footprint and short playtime.

Great states of Seige game. Three distinct ages where first you expand, fight off other tribes, later fight off the Spanish.

This game is hard.

It is a quick setup, reset, and tear down, and provides enough interesting decisions and enough tension at times to make this one a keeper.  

Will be an "in the mood" game though.

Much too random for my taste: success or failure is determined by dice rolls with too little influence from the player. The theme and historical content are great, but the game isn't interesting enough to me to support it.

I have next to no interest in the theme but that's not really the problem I have with it; I just don't enjoy the mechanics of the game that much. It's quite a complex and fiddly rule-set to learn but ultimately each turn comprises of you drawing a card, seeing what happens, maybe getting a few actions and rolling a die to see if they succeed or not.

This is the first VPG game I tried and I was advised that this is one of their titles that provides the most ways to mitigate bad luck. It is also unique (I believe) in that there is a period of building up your domain before the onslaught begins. Unfortunately, it's still not quite enough for me.

After 7-8 plays I quite enjoy it, and look forward to further games. My rating may well go up if I enjoy it as much when I return. And I fully plan to return. A keeper, and my favorite, so far, of the S.o.S. games I've played.

Theme and historical content drew me to game. Nice game components 
 Rule book OK, I guess.   
 After wasting 1/2 hour slices of my life making it 1/2 way through a game and failing again & again & again & again & again & again. Well, after approx. 25 times actually. I gave up.
 _Roll dice- fail,  draw for fresh disappointments. Lose. shuffle cards/reset game. Start new game and follow card directions for deterioration. Any choices you make will be mitigated eventually by bad dice rolls or cards. 
 

Never got past 1st half of game to see how 2nd 1/2 plays  !!!!

Most disappointing game I've ever bought.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  I played this twice when I first got the game, and then it sat on the shelf, unplayed, for over two years.  Big mistake on my part.  After finally playing it again, I'm really, really enjoying it.

It's certainly a States of Siege game. It's a single deck of cards. Five tracks of enemies, tower defense style. Lots of dice rolling. Like...a lot. But it's much more than that. There are three distinct eras: two quicker ones that bookend the "standard" SoS gameplay of the longer middle era. The first era actually sets up the game for you, and I love it! You build out your empire as far and as strong as you can for the first ten cards. Whatever heights you have reached at that point is where the enemy will begin its march against you. So cool.

The main part of the game will be more of your typical SoS gameplay where one or more of the enemies will advance toward your center location. You push them back, set up extra defenses, and take various other actions. Then, finally, the Spanish arrive. Suddenly, the long struggle of just surviving the constant onslaught of hostiles sees an end only to have a "big bad" enter the game and beeline it for your home city. The tension is kicked up and you have to hold them off just a little bit longer than you want to maintain a glimmer of hope for victory.

Such a good game. I wish every historically themed game had as much information on their cards as MB does. It's awesome! I really love how the "standard" States of Siege style gameplay gets an upgrade with three similar but different feeling eras. And while I haven't been successful yet, I can see how your choices and actions matter beyond what the fate of the dice rolls may bring your way. I have good memories from my previous two plays way back in early 2015, but these latest sessions solidified how excellent this game is.

Rulebook text is tiny, and like the there States Of Siege games, the rules are always harder to learn than they should be.

I'm really impressed by this SoS, it's clearly splitted in 2 parts, the slow building-up where you must rush to discover precious resources, and then the pressure begins with the classic armies assaulting along the paths. This good sense of progression (towards the inevitable bad end, that's it) is a nice digression from the classic "in media res" SoS games so far.

An okay game that I found it too hard to follow the instructions. I do appreciate the game trying to expand the typical states of siege engine by adding different eras, however the different eras are the biggest flaw for me as well finding it hard to shift between them easily.

As another user mentioned in his Comments, the rules seem unnecessarily difficult to follow, esp given that this is not a complex game.

Without Prof Marco's video, I might not have figured out how to play this game.

After playing four games, I think the rulebook is so-so, not terrible.   The bigger problem in terms of learning curve is that there are a lot of special cases, making the game engine challenging to document in the rulebook.  As a result, rules about Peace Pipes are spread throughout the rulebook.

Speaking of having Peace Pipe rules spread throughout the rulebook, this rulebook could benefit from an index.

Also, I didn't care for the use of color.   For example, examples of play are introduced by the word 'Example' and printed in blue, while I thought that they could have been printed in black and instead used blue to set off Advanced rules mentioned to The Advanced Game, which begins on page 25.

This rulebook needs an extensive play example in one place, as opposed to the fragments of rule-specific examples that it has.

Unlike most other solitaire States of Siege games, Mound Builders begins during an age of expansion, a time when you will define the civilization that will be your destiny to defend.  In terms of weight, the breadth of decision making is less in the moment, but more in the changing landscape of the three eras and the need for long term planning to maintain control.  The spread of  the game is 20% growth period, followed by 70% tribal strife, with the last 10% being the Spanish invasion.

Planning your expansion around long term resilience is key because the age of prosperity seems fleeting.  When the era shifts, neighboring tribes start attacking your borders and eventually two terrifying sieges by the newly arriving Spanish will challenge everything you built.

The greater part of the Mound Building cultures had gone into decline and were no longer a factor when the Spanish arrived with their gifts of smallpox and death.  This game represents an opportunity to change history and even repel the first two Spanish invasions as the greatest Native North American empire in history.

The Spanish will come in from one of the Southern three paths.  I did not put a spoiler alert on that info because it happened 500 years ago.  The cards are approximately 33% historical notes, which you can learn a great deal from if the subject interests you.

All of this is packed in a 9"x6" box with VP's signature laser cut components.  The compactness of Mound Builders makes it a great game to take on the go, but it does require a tabletop sized space to play.

The more I play, the less I like it.  Death spiral problem.  Roll an early 1 on the die, and it is difficult to regain your economy.   Each of the tracks seems the same, except for the number on the enemy. The flavor text on the cards is not interesting.

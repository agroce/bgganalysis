Essen 2017 - Zombies and the Terraforming Mars team. What is not to like?

Thoughts after iniital (multiple) solo plays - light and enjoyable game. Not sure about the multiplayer as there is almost no interaction bar teh ability to kill zombies in another's deck and some limited healing. Plays fine solo and the 4 characters have enough differences to make them stand out. Huge number of scenarios as well.

Updated rating to 8 - a lot more replayability that appears at first glance and the missions are subtly different.

Very nice and different deck builder.
Almost each Card is different and offers a unique effect. So you Need to decide what Cards you buy. 
The game works very well solo but offers some more tactic choices when playing Multi Player.

I've houseruled that you get their bonus reward in addition to rescuing any survivor in the first missions, otherwise the game seems nigh impossible to beat. Even with this variation the game is still hard.

RATING: 7.5
Only played as two player coop.
Good little co-op deck/tableu-builder. It feels different than what deckbuilding usually does. There's more choices and strategies in the game than is apparent from the beginning. Characters with different starting decks and many scenarios greatly increases the replayability.
I just wish there were more cards that enable players to cooperate.

played prototype, its hard to win and addictive. Took 8 attempts to beat the intro level, other group of players beat it in 2 attempts. Artwork.........its so bad, so very bad maybe they where trying to show how terrible a zombie apocalypse would look? Big headed odd characters, is it a salute to Chibi art? or maybe it will change.

Fantástico para jugar en solitario. El arte es tan feo que le da la vuelta al canon y acaba por resultar simpático.

I picked this up at _Tour des Jeux_ and was so pleasantly surprised to see that it was playable, fun and not broken despite the iffy artwork.   This one is a real charmer: So many different types of players really like it.  The rulebook is difficult to understand, though the game is understandable quickly.  I find the weakest aspect is in the setup: The game would be vastly improved by having different colored decks, one for each player.  Currently, setup is confusing for the new player, and long for returning ones.  I intend to correct this by sleeving in 3 colors.  Totally worth it!

Nice game. Really hard. The art style remembers on Steve Madden commercials, it's ok.

The deck building system was quite good. Still, I don't like zombie games. With a different setting, like "alien invasion", I would have increased the rating one step.

Really great deckbuilding game!  The scenarios are easily arranged - playing time is very convenient (rather short in a solo session). Has interesting cards and mechanisms. After 6 solo sessions I rate it  a nine.

Deck builder, where frequently the scenarios allow for very little deck building.  Worse still, the game punishes you for not building your deck or for getting cards out into your play area (which you will need to deal with the zombies).  
Still the game tends to be quite quick, and there is definitely some amusement to be had with a reasonable amount of variety in the scenarios; it's decent enough for what it is.

Jó volt, kicsit átvariálja a deckbuildingről alkotott elképzeléseket. A téma nekem mindig hálás, de sajnos a feleségemnek nem, így csak ritka alkalmakkor fogok hozzájutni. Annak viszont nagyon fogok örülni, hiszen hangulatos és vicces kis zombihentelésről van itt sz, melyben külön mókás az easter eggek felfedezése. :)

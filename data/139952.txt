Solid game. Really like the secret deployment and the concept of tech advances being linked to a map location. However, this is a game where the things you want to be doing - buying sweet steam tanks or surprise attacking another players citadel - are the things that don't earn points, which is a bit frustrating.

Very good dudes on a map/territory building game. The game has a lot of latitude and different strategies to pursue but never feels fiddly. And thanks in part to the hidden simultaneous deployment, it moves along at a good clip. Lots of replayability value here. The only thing I would caution is that it is very harsh and does not hold your hand, you will get trounced pretty badly if you don't play well. Really nice game, wish I could get to the table more often.

Really like this game. It's an area control with enough other stuff going on that you don't feel like you are just attacking each other. To me, it has the feel (not the mechanisms) of a more wargamy Deus.

RATING: 8
I had high hopes for this and it delivers. The variability of the Discoveries and maps, the tension of the deployment, the way the game twists and turns and allows for amazing comebacks is really an experience. 

Long setup-explanation time, and some card ability/timing ambiguities stops this from being a 10 but it's really a great game deserving a solid solid 8. One of the best area control games I've played.

Enjoyed the game. The simultaneous movement works nicely in my opinion. I think it makes you have to think about how you lay your soldiers out. I thought how the tiles worked were great. It made moving worth maybe getting your butt  kicked. The espionage,  discoveries, and generals give a nice flair and abilities that you really want to have. There is more to the game that I like such as the quality, play time, and looks. The only negative I would say is that the spymaster abilities were just okay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Criminally underrated and underappreciated. This game is fantastic, tense, and tons of fun. There are complaints about the espionage cards and how "overpowered" some discoveries can be. That's the point; this is an Ameritrash game in Euro clothing and is an excellent choice for people looking for a hybrid game.

I like the variable board and random discovery card and court set up but some of the discoveries are ridiculously good (seeing eye, for example) and others will supply a steady stream of VPs. Some of the R&D cards also seem to be overly powerful whilst others are quite weak. Also the Leviathan strikes me as much better than the others (Guardian and Steam Tank) but the cost is still 5+2 research tokens. Not too long at about 90 minutes (if you are not learning the rules). Probably best with 4 but still good with 3 players.

Some neat concepts in here. The hidden deployment is pretty great as well as the interactions over territories. I really dislike the Espionage cards, they seem very swingy and unbalanced. Also, A player could easily be ganged up on without the opportunity to get back into it. Other than that, the components look great and the game played in decent time. Part of me wants to play it more but I know I would just get frustrated.

Had a blast with this one.  It looks like a bigger game than it is due to its pieces, but it plays fairly quickly, the turn limit looks small, but makes it so everyone is running down every point they can.  I think of our first game of this as a very quick and dirty play of Twilight Imperium.  I think I'll be bringing this one with me to gencon to give some people a chance to play this game that hasn't seen enough coverage.

Notes:

Medium weight area control, resource management game. Could this be what Game of Thrones should have been? I found the cards to be a bit swingy, in the scheme of things, with one or two things desperately needing a house rule. Overall the game delivers and engaging experience with some take that! I like the fact that you can do a custom build of the map.

RATING: 5
It's a shame that I have to rate this so low on the scale because there's a lot of love behind it.  I went in with zero expectations and zero knowledge of whatever hype might have surrounded this title, but I walked away ultimately disappointed.  I'm not sure what other people see in this game except, perhaps, the need to justify their purchase.

Clockwork Wars makes an ambitious attempt to throw the kitchen sink at the table, but throughout its course, it felt like something was off.  By the last few turns in the final age of the three that are presented in the game, it became less about playing it and more about seeing just how insane the design could get.  I couldn't believe what was able to happen in this game and perhaps I was expecting something completely different, but it seemed like it would be most at home at a table full of Jack Nicholsons, laughing in that obnoxious way whenever anything went south.  From ridiculous scoring boosters to outright player obliteration, Clockwork Wars just didn't seem to want us to take it seriously.  One moment, you could be working your gameplan, setting yourself up for some great scoring opportunities or getting yourself into a nice defensible position when someone just suddenly plays a card or one of the guardians and suddenly everything is torn out from under you.  This wouldn't normally be a problem if it simply didn't take so long to accomplish even the tiniest of things.  Like your computer crashing after you've worked for hours on an essay or a project and realizing that you forgot to save your work, in flew any wild mechanism that the designers sought to implement and out went anything you were trying to do.  There are games that do this thing exceedingly well and they're fun and engaging, but in comparison, they're also quick and simple.   Clockwork Wars is arguably neither, but your mileage may vary.  

In the end, it felt like there were just so many core concepts thrown together without thinking how well they would fit together; the result was a weird cacophony of gaming ideas that were constantly at conflict with one another.  A take-that Euro that's Ameritrashy and too epic in length, too swingy and chaotic, yet abstracted and what the hell are these Espionage cards all about??

While I think the game has its potential audience, I rather think it's best summed up in one word: unfocused.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
I really liked the simultaneous troop deployment, really sets this game apart. Rules seem simple and mostly are, but there's quite a bit more to think about with the technologies, court, special abilities, production, scoring, etc. than it first seems.

Setup can be a bit painful and I wish there were meeples or something other than the disks to represent your workers.

Need another play to see where this slots in with Kemet, Blood Rage, etc. but given how unique the game play is and how beautiful the components, this is a keeper.

Clockwork Wars is an awesome and underappreciated gem of a game.  Area control is the primary gaming mechanic, but it's the modular board, randomized tech trees, and the super awesome simultaneous hidden deployment system that all make for a super fun gaming experience.

Wow. An epic strategy game that's quick to play yet has plenty to chew on, with MASSIVE replayability, freakishly gorgeous artwork and components and a pretty perfect insert. Lots of good stuff if you like area control with some mind games, low luck and strategy over chance and tactics. There's tactical play, but a solid strategy is necessary to succeed, and mistakes can be punishing. Overall, highly recommend!

Clockwork Wars is a rather good area control game with customizable everything, which adds a lot of variety.  Lots of overpowered effects to acquire, but everyone has access to them- so it's an all out blood bath at times to the end to see which faction reigns supreme!  As Ameritrash/Euro hybrids of that "kill everything with no forgiveness" sort of gameplay, I rate Clockwork Wars up there with Nexus Ops, though it doesn't achieve the sort of unique brilliance I found with The core mechanics of 'Chaos in the Old World' or 'Blood Rage'.  But CW is much easier to teach and play and at times even enjoy than its more intricate forefathers.  CW might offer no real surprises in terms of design but it does dish out solid gameplay and tension at all the right times.  While I find the game somewhat standard fare, the secret deployment of units is really what makes this game interesting.  It feels like such a vintage mechanic (paper and pencil?!) but its inclusion here just fits very well.  Not a huge fan of the pastiche theme, but it serves the game without interference. Another good thing about this game is that it works very well with 2 players, which is rare for this style of game.  Artwork and component quality generally are top-notch.  Other little problems here and there but nothing that gets in the way so much as to mention it here.  Overall, if Nexus Ops or CitOW are your types of games, you should find something intriguing here!

RATING: 8
Simultaneus placement of soilders is great. 
The deployment rules are great and feel natural. 
They could have done better components to have more of a theme. 

Many special ways to win battles and screw your opponents. Perhaps too many and too few stragegic ways to get an advantage on the map. 

A bit unbalanced race special abilities, technologies, cards (some way to strong) and generals. 

Only few things that if you have a type of tiles you get something extra...but they are there and you have to fight for them which is a good thing. 

Like the game alot...next time I play it I know all the standard rules and can focus on the special things that are available that game.

Probably one of the most entertaining, epic-ish, area control games I've played.  It feels like Kemet with less focus on aggression.  The 3.08 difficulty rating is about right.  Its not a simple game like Quantum, but its not Cry Havoc in complexity.  Cry Havoc was a boring game that was very unclear to me. Clockwork made sense from the moment you start.

The different bits fit together very nicely, and it's got a lot of stuff that I like. The asymmetry, though, is not terribly substantial, and the techs seem useful but not especially satisfying or fun--so the variety in the game might only be skin-deep. Willing to try some more to be proven wrong, because the double-think is unique and well-executed.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc de conquesta de territoris, es guanya per PVs.

Poca cosa a destacar, el moviment d'unitats és simultani, cosa que sona bé, però no acaba de funcionar del tot bé en els jocs on ho he vist. Hi han pocs tipus de territoris i tots son iguals (fins i tot es pot jugar en mode "abstracte", sense ilustracions a les losetes, només el color que indica el tipus).

RATING: 5.5
Had high hopes for this. During play however, my enthusiasm for this game continually diminished. For me, the game is too chaotic/unbalanced regarding the espionage cards and the techs. The combat lacks some depth since it's always a 1:1 trade if you don't have a +X combat strength tech or one of the combat-related espionage cards.

Première partie pour jouer en mode apprentissage.  Je n'ai pas la version avec les miniatures des opérateurs ça ajoute plus de torque au jeu je pense.  Je vais commander aussi les autres hex et l'extension pour plus de techno et autres tuiles.

Beaucoup de critques envers le style take that du jeu vs 3.5x mais chaque personne à ses chances de planter l'autre et je pensais aussi que avec les research il y aurait un orgie de découverte mais on chaque research à son hex et on peut aller le voler ce qui est bon.  Les cartes espions très bon aussi et la première étape du spy, la court il y a plein de choses à regarder en même temps.  C'est sur que selon les découvertes qui sortent parfois le jeu est moins rough.  La carte que l'on peut mettre random ou ajuster selon les joueurs est un gros plus.

Je refais une autre partie car je me suis planté dans l'étape de la pollution qui n'est pas à chaque tour ce qui fait que mes workers/solders étaient très disponible mais en appliquant les règles on se rend compte de l'importance d'attendre avant de placer ses pions sur les hex qui rapportent des VP.

Partie juste assez longue pour ma part.  Pour ce qui est de l'assmétrie c'est les unique units qui le font mais c'est pas mal tout.

Hidden movement where you write down how you move your troops and hope you out maneuvered your opponents. Horribly unsatisfying mechanism to an otherwise decent fighting game. One and done for me.

RATING: 8.3
What I liked:

-The modular map; it keeps the game fresh with every play. You can even create your own scenarios!
-Epic war game feel that plays in under 2 hours of gameplay.
-The powerful espionage cards work great as a take-that mechanic, but do not feel too unbalanced in a 2-player game. Everyone has access to them and the cards are highly situational. 
-The cardboard bits and artwork both have a very high quality look/feel to them. 
-Simultaneous movement is an amazing mechanic; creates tension every round and streamlines the entire game. 

What I didn't like:
-The loss of your race's special unit really ruins the whole asymmetrical aspect between the races since there is no mechanic to revive them.  
-While espionage cards work great in 2 player games, 3-4 player games tend to be very swingy. With more players to grab all available cards, there are turns where multiple cards are played and your "working" strategy falls apart. 
-I wish the base game came with more spy court variations. With the huge amount of possible combinations you can get from the map tiles and discoveries, it seems like an oversight to only be able to play with a selection of three courts.

Easy area control game where players choose the territories that want to move to secretly. Wish it was more meatier like more tech to choose from or the ability to move troops that are already on squares at all times. The blind combat is a little wonky because you can't choose to retreat. Regardless still had fun and would play it again.

An interesting Area control game, with simultaneous deplyment of troops.

Pros:
- Hidden troops deployment adds a lot of fun tension and surprise events to the game
- Fast and easy combat system
- Every player can win, no matter how the board looks like
- The court-system is a very fun extra mechanic
- Supplyline mechanic adds a bunch of tactic options to the game in order to cut a supplyline or prevent the same.

Cons:
- it takes a while to learn all the different phases and subsequences
- Some Espionage/Discovery combos can be OP
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I did like how the map influences things: having production regions near one's capital is different from having research centers there. Having a region between two lakes was important for the Water Mill Discovery,…

I did like the fast turns and the quiet concentration of the shared Deployment phase.

I appreciate how clear the rulebook is.

The rules are simple (simpler than Manoeuvre's, I find, with their complicated exhaustive checklist of things to do, that actually rarely matter and obscure simple principles). They are essentially streamlined, except for the fact that "Soldier" is not cleanly defined: sometimes Unique Units seem to be soldiers, while sometimes they are not (they are not, for the purpose of Discoveries).

The final scoring method could be listed on the player screens: it can be easy to forget (during the first play) that Influence Points count for Victory Points.

After 3 games, I still remember a few details that happened in each of them, many weeks or months afterwards: this is thanks to the strong flavor of the card powers, and to the fact that we only see a few of them in play in a given game. I thus remember the Underground Network (?) that surprised me once, where so many ground troops were actually spies (theme and mechanics worked well together). There was also this game with these nagging hermits that did not need to have supply, and really established a second base of deployment; that was deliciously annoying. In the last game, there was this great University from my scholarly opponent, in the so attractive Nexus (Sentience expansion), that drew me to it, only to have them backstab me while I was turning to this marvel: they switched from being orderly scholars during an era to scheming, violent aggressors in the next one. Overall, these memories really owe it to the strong thematic and mechanical flavor of the cards, coupled with their scarcity, which makes them all the more memorable.

Really feels like the Game of Thrones Board Game done right. There's a lot to like about Clockwork Wars, but for every aspect I like, there's two things I dislike. The game is longer than it should be, not nearly as asymmetric as it promises to be, the upgrades and cards aren't nearly as game-changing as I would like them to be, and victory points are tough to come by, but very easy to lose. There's some extra junky mechanisms rattling around also, but that's more forgivable here than in other games due to how solid the overall design is. As for what I like, I found the troop deployment more interesting than I expected, I love how dynamic the different tile types are, and games with deterministic combat are always a big plus for me. I enjoyed playing this game, but I prefer other, more streamlined area control games. This felt like Nexus Ops with a bunch of chrome added on top, and that game thrives on its simplicity. This one isn't bad, but probably not worth the price point for most people.

Played once with my daughter two-player. I like the flow of the game - it's an area control game with a Euro feel, with very simple combat but a lot of different ways to deploy, build up and get victory points, and a number of interesting purchaseable technologies. The fun part about it is that when you're deciding where to place your armies, you do it simultaneously and in secret, then reveal at the same time. We decided, though, that it's probably more interesting with more players - the trick is to find people who are interested in games with a wargame feel but that are really more Euro-ish. I'm a little surprised there wasn't more buzz about this game, but it might have gotten overshadowed by Blood Rage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The biggest thing that makes this game so fun is the hidden deployment. It makes a simple combat have the element of making reads of what your opponent will do. The discovery cards give the game a load of depth and replayability. The special units (faction specific and generals) can turn the tide and can also be a disaster. And the modular board always gives the game a unique feel. Can't wait for it to hit the table again.

RATING: 5
Could have been great--but the main problem is wild randomness. You can have a rock solid strategy and along comes one card and it's all out the window.  Cards are too powerful, special abilities generally underwhelming. A lot of verbiage to read coming from many angles. Very limited ways to get victory points--just a couple different types of tiles on the board, period.  The player who won was the one who turtled, used his special power well and the other players helped by leaving him alone.

Varying powers for the individual factions are interesting and, I believe, pretty well balanced.  Minis (3)are cool. I liked the hidden decision part of the game (though it contributes to the randomness).

I do like area control games but this was just too wild, uncontrollable ride of a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the simple mechanics of this development and battle based game. You fight for space but there are no dice, just a one to one battle system. However the cards are way too powerful and cause a lot of random changes for little cost which I found actually add to the fun, just don't take it too seriously. The turn play has an excellent flow and great mechanics. I'll be looking forward to more plays.

Box is way bigger than necessary, which is annoying. 

The "fancy" plastic insert is designed to hold elements from expansions and promos, which is also annoying... and it doesn't seem to have the right shaped slots for all the bits that DO come with the base game. 

And the "high quality minis" are actually pretty low quality. 
 
 
Pretty poor first impression!

With 3-4 players, this game eats up the afternoon. We spent 4.5 hours to get through one session (including setup time). After the 2 hr mark, I was ready for the game to be over so we could move on to something else. The theme and artwork are wonderful, but the balance issues can be problematic. A poor start on the map spells certain doom for you, and the game would like you to believe that there are many strategies to victory...but if you end up contesting zones with other players while someone else gets ignored...that guy will just soak victory points and win the game.

I have never had a serious game provide such an enjoyable first-play experience. The mechanics are very smooth, the unique units are thematic and fun, and the balance feels great. I seldom play war games, but I thoroughly enjoyed the implementation of hidden deployment in Clockwork Wars. Eager to get this game back on the table.

Interesting area control game that has an interesting mix of hidden movement / bluffing with a dash of resource management. I greatly enjoy the diceless and fast to resolve combat. Also very responsive and enthusiastic designer.

Suspect it might suffer from a lack of catch-up for players who are losing early. Has a little bit of repetition as well. Some of the espionage powers may not be balanced as well. Probably best at 4 players. 5 players probably disadvantageous for the sandwiched player. A few of the cards' artwork look inconsistent in style due to the many different artists involved

This game met my expectation to be a careful balance between light, easy to resolve combat with intriguing opportunities for bluffing and mind games, while still achieving the satisfaction of feeling like a commander poring over a map. 

Unfortunately, due to the difficulty and commitment needed to host this game, I have since sold this away

Good simultaneous movement mechanics and beautiful drawings.

Unfortunately, the victory machnik is very unbalanced and heavily focused on techs, which are useless or heavily overpowered. Based on the player order, you have no chance to get the good ones. Playing cards are randomly drawn and also vary very strongly.

The combat system relies on units with a life / damage ratio of 1/1. I personally hate this, as it prevents any tactical efficiency optimization. The battles are thus a single blunt resource battle without any takitsche finesse. Therefore, nothing can be effectively defended leading to a king of the hill problem.

:) Very fresh feeling
:) Simultaneous hidden "worker placement" is amazing
:) A crazy amount of replay value, no 2 games the same
:) Very cool overpowered discover cards
:) The crazy mix of magic, religion and scifi works well
:) Probably highest quality box and insert I've ever seen (that's not custom made or collector's)

:!block: - Some will not like how powerful the discover cards are

:soblue: Wood discs for workers. Minis would have been awesome. Stickers should have been in atleast
:soblue: R&D Always gets taken first. Needs different way to deal out those cards

I'm the designer of Clockwork Wars, a game that's been under various stages of creation and development since 2008.  I signed a contract with Eagle-Gryphon games, and we ran a successful Kickstarter in September 2014. The game shipped to US/Canadian backers in June/July 2015 and to EU backers in September 2015.  Getting this published has been a dream come true.

Only one play, so take all this with a few grains of salt.

This was a bit of a surprise. It hasn't gotten the splash of some of the other hex and dudes games with a Euro flavor (Hyperborea, Deus) and so I hadn't noticed it. Til now. Glad I did. It's a great combo of things I like in games. The rules are smooth and intuitive. Basically you just get income and then send dudes out onto the map to make more income. Combat is simple, weaker side dies, winner matches losses. What makes this game better than that simple system is all the chrome and modifiers. 

Every weird magic steampunk side has its own special unit with unique abilities. Then there are three master units anyone can buy. Then there are nine super rule-breaking spells/abilities that anyone can buy (also funky espionage cards). Put that all together and by turn 3 you each are wielding special bonuses and modifiers that make battles far more interesting. 

The game also has lots of variability. Those 9 special abilities you can buy come from a pool of 45, randomly changed every game. The map is also different every time. Finally, it's quick to teach. The rules are simple, all the complexity (what there is) is in the various card texts.

The game's not brain surgery. I'd call it medium light. It's also not super flavorful. However, it has just enough flavor to push it above those dry Euro fake hex wargames. It's like a dudes on a map battle game with enough Euro smoothness to go down easy.

I was a bit afraid of the hidden movement and amount of hidden information in this game.  It was the first time trying a hidden movement game and trying to teach it.  We all highly enjoyed the first game and found it kept things interesting trying to guess what was going to happen next.

This is an area control game with a lot of really neat ideas and a lot of direct player interaction.

In this game each player takes control of a specific faction vying for control of a planet.  Each faction differs in the unique unit they have.  Each unique unit gives some kind of special power but the unit can be destroyed and once it is gone, it's gone.

You take controls of the spaces on the board with secret deployment orders which are carried out simultaneously.  This is a really neat and one of my favorite parts of the game.  You really need to get into your opponents head and really plan out a good strategy when planning your secret orders.  If you deploy in the same area as an opponent then a battle occurs.  The spaces all do varied things as well.  Some provide points at the end of each age.  Some allow you to reinforce battles.  Some give you more workers to place during deployment.  Some give you a resource called influence points that allow you to buy discoveries that give you special powers.  The other thing that is really nice about this is much of the game can be played simultaneously cutting down drastically on downtime.

This is the other really neat part of the game.  There are 9 discoveries available each game and they vary your powers and play style by purchasing them but only one can really be "saved" by placing it into your headquarters.  The rest have to be placed on specific map hexes and can be taken over and the discovery claimed by opponents.

There are a ton more features like generals that can be bought and espionage cards that can be played.  There is a lot to this game making it very deep and plays very varied.  Like I said though, the game forces you into combat reasonably early on so you should only play this game if you are okay with being mean (or with others being mean to you).

Also, the components are fantastic.  The art is great, the tiles are thick and double sided so you can see beautiful realistic art or an abstract symbol showing what the tile is which is a really good addition.  The insert is fabulous too with spaces for all the pieces and even a lid to keep everything secure.

I was unimpressed with this game.  The hidden deployment works well, and I like the way they implemented that mechanic.  Besides that, everything else was a mess.  Only nine techs come out per game, but they are of such varying quality that some will be amazing and many will not even be bought.  The attrition-based combat is quick playing, which helps out the game a lot, but it is also uninteresting and rewards overly defensive plays.  The court intrigue cards had even worse balance.  Some were unbelievably amazing, and some were just awful.  I did like the mechanic of sending a guy to the court to use one, though.

The point scoring is horrifyingly out of whack.  It is not easy to score points, and there can easily be a runaway leader, because there is just nothing anyone can do in the final age to score enough points to catch up.  Even worse, there will almost certainly be a lame duck player in any 4-player game, because it is just mathmatically impossible to catch back up.  None of the point scoring is obfuscated, so you just have to play it out knowing that you are guaranteed to lose.  

The game just feels like a really nice prototype that is headed in the right direction, but it needs a LOT of work before it would actually be good.  Unfortunately, this is the Kickstarter age, so that is how games are often released.

Startegy goes out the window due to balance problems/wild swings. Takes a mish-mash of previously used mechanics and throws them into a pot. The game needed to be better defined.

The natural side of the tiles was a poor choice; at least we have the reverse side (which is clear). Other than that, the game looks quite good.

Sorry, but I just didn't enjoy playing this one much at all for the length of time it took to play.

A weird mix of euro area control and AT overpowered cards (which isn't actually a complaint in that all of the cards appear to be overpowered, making none of them overpowered?). There was much to like here, but in actuality it was a little too chaotic for the time investment. In addition, turn order seemed vital at times with no way to mitigate or control it. It felt... underdeveloped.

Really fantastic! It's been a week since my first play and I'm still thinking about it daily.  Can't wait to get another play in so I expect it's rating to climb.  A very novel feeling take on a bloated genre of area control.  Love the simultaneous planning, the abstract dance on the board, the limited technologies that are fought over and define each game.  It's great stuff!

It's hard to explain what I find so pleasant about the gameplay.  You would think that a game that relies entirely on strategy without any luck, where points and resources are so tight, would be stressful.  Quite the contrary, I actually find it almost relaxing, there's little pressure or risk necessarily, each turn is a mini puzzle trying to guess what your opponents are doing, and what you need to do to accomplish a goal.  This is done in silence as everyone is scribbling notes on their pad of paper for deployment, maybe a few idle threats in the air to try and bluff someone out, or keep someone away from a choice spot, but for the most part you plan out your turn a the start of the round and then watch how it plays out.  There's something comforting about that rather than Blood Rage where every single choice and action could get thrown of in realtime.

Steampunk modular hex wargame with animal-headed, anthropomorphics, and true blood factions over three ages. Great artwork and production with some unique mechanics. Labeled hexes map is constructed at startup.  No buildings, they are permanent strategic locations on the hex tiles. Secret movement is written on paper then revealed from behind player screens that often leads to combat. Combat is simple majority and elimination of stacked unit chips. Interesting tech tree options spending science, religion, and sorcery.  Deploy powerful generals.  Need to manage majority of the court objectives in addition to map area control. A lot of good stuff going on.  A little surprised it isn’t more known?

This was a game I initially passed over since I dislike Steampunk aesthetics and the games that Eagle Gryphon publishes aren't generally the types of games that interest me. But after reading Space-Biff's glowing review, I had to reconsider as his taste is often quite in line with my own. I picked it up on sale, and boy, am I glad I gave it a chance. 

This is simply a fantastic game with a genuinely smart mix of Euro and Ameri mechanics. The hidden deployment adds a whole new layer of strategy that I haven’t found in many other games of this type and its discoveries ensure that each game will feel different. It’s one of those games where you must simply applaud your opponents for their ingenuity and resourcefulness. This will definitely be a game that quickly rises in the ranks of my favorite games, I think. I'm so glad I gave it a chance, despite my Steampunk dislike (and the Steampunk aesthetic is happily quite light).

One of my all time favorites.  Easy to learn, fast-paced, and can be introduced to newbies, the young, and non-gamers.  Besides, there's nothing like standing toe-to-toe, firing at an opponent's hull.  I prefer this over Naval War.

Played this once with four players when first released; it was cheaply produced and seemed "blah." Played recently two-player, and it seems somewhat better (especially if the other player has bad luck).

20 Play: This is a "take that" game with a bit of meat on it. Your choices of what you can do on your turn allow for a number of strategies. Tabletalk is essential as the game generally creates a "bash the leader" mentality. I enjoy this game alot, although it's been years since I played it.

Still wacky but less so than Brawling Battleships and I still have fun. There are more possible actions during your turn that increase tactical depth. I love the small box size and plastic coated cards.

I remember I wrote a letter to the General magazine (of Avalon Hill) and had an answer in one of their editorials.
I was mad that Avalon Hill published and sold such crap as a wargame.
How could I know that a few years later AH was sold to Hasbro. Killing the wargame industry completely.
This game should have been a warning of things to come.

RATING: 8
What can I say?  This is a great game. It can be played multiple times in an evening and even in teams.  My cards are starting to suffer the ravages to time, perhaps I should laminate them.  This is NOT a simulation of age of sail combat, but rather a card game with that flavor.  Winning is never assured.  You need 100 points to win the game, we had a guy score 98 on the first hand and never won.  If you are looking for a fun fast game to play with the guys, this can't be beat.

A game that I'd enjoy more if it was more historical. I just can't get over ships from countries that were fighting against each other fighting on the same side against ships from the exact same nations. I want to fight English against the Spanish or French not the English/French/Spanish against the Spanish/English/French.What can I say? I'm training to be a grognard.

RATING: 7
Naval War is better and lighter, but this is still fun. I think part of the problem this game has is that while the box says 2-8 players the game suffers if you play it with any number other than 4 or maybe 5. 2 players is boring. 3 players two players take each other down and the third gets easy pickings. 6-8 players has too much downtime. This game is definitely most fun with 4 players.

While fun, I didn't find it played quick enough for a game of this depth.

The random ship draw and hand-based aspects seem to turn this into a combination of 'the cards play you' and 'everyone pick on the guy with the best fleet'.

Not bad, but nowhere near great.

Quite enjoy playing this game but I would only want a quick game.  After all I can think of much better games to play.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

Never really took to the game where you can have British, French or Spanish ships in the same line of battle but on the other hand it was fun. And, more importantly, it dates from an era when AH's History of the World was the other 'simple' game. No question when we wanted to play something quick.

I have probably played this game fifty times during my high school and college years.  It is definately fun to play with a group of well known friends.  The game can get brutal if everyone gangs up on one person.  Most games are won by sneaky moves at the close of a round.  The ship cards are pretty cool and dropping a four point broadside with a +2 rake is always satisfying.

It is difficult rating 80's games like this one. I am sure that if I rate them based on memory of how much I enjoyed playing them "back in the day" they would get better ratings than based on recent plays. I did not play this game back then, but if I had, I'm sure I would have played it a bunch.

Enemy in Sight is a good game and good example of the Avalon Hill war games. The rules are simple enough, especially compared to some, but the rule book is a bit convoluted. I could see that a new production of the game with real cards, modern production techniques and quality, and rewritten, possibly lightly streamlined rules would get high marks. Maybe something already exists and I just haven't played it.

The game is listed for up to 8 players. I have only played it with 2 and, while that player count eliminates some of the play elements, I would not want to play with more than 4. Purely a guess, but 3, maybe 4 is probably the sweet spot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played the hell out of this back in the day.  (probably 50+ games) Excellent game that can easily be taught to all ages, rapidly assimilated and finished quickly.  So why an 8?  Well, unlike some of the later naval card games, there aren't many defensive options and a player can suffer rather badly if he gets ganged up upon so these days there are better options available (I favor Starforce: Terra myself).

Better than a Euro, which is not saying a lot. It's pretty random, and being able to discard only one card per turn can make it absolutely brutal when you have a dud hand. Combat is extremely chaotic, with everyone trying to do just the right amount of damage: enough that you can take advantage of it on your next chance, not enough that others can swoop in and take your prize. Boarding is pretty random. All sorts of weirdness here.

Honestly, it doesn't make a Hell of a lot of sense. It's...a card game...with ships on the cards.

Super game, Family favorite for years, played game to death and had to buy a second one as first wore out. Did find game a bit tense for younger players, and sentimental ones. Seems players get very attached to their ships, and take it personal when you capture their ship. I like the way ships are fairly difficult to sink, which is more realistic, though this game has no historical value in scenario recreation, it does work well as fleet against fleet warfare. This was a Great game for my 3 boys and friends, recently bought third game for one of my sons for his gaming group. I think if you have two players with a bit of an axe to grind in game group, bring this game out, always fun to watch two players clobber each other only to turn unite, and decimate a third player that thought he would sneak some shot into their battle. Very playable game highly recommended. One of the few games that i have experienced that stands on its own, no errata, expansions or corrections for play needed.

A very fun, multi-player game.  Nothing more fun than blasting holes in the enemy's rigging and then sending in a boarding party!  And of course, you have to sing "Breaking the Line" as if it was Judas Priest's "Breaking the Law"

I enjoy this game more than most, but then I love the Age of Sail.  Card distribution is the problem for many, because if you don't get a decent hand you're helpless, though that shouldn't happen often.  The forced events also annoy some.

But the game has balancing mechanics.  The way that hands are played out you can be on top of the world one hand and crushed in the next.  There will definitely be a "get the leader" aspect to the game, which will annoy some and not bother others (I don't happen to mind it).

Interesting choices to make and well executed to balance risk with reward.  You can be the target, but because of the prize mechanics still end up scoring because you're capturing opposing vessels.  And even if you're the leader, pecking away at an opponent can give others a reason to leave you alone as they pursue cheap points from someone else.

Not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but it can be relatively quick and fun.

This is a refinement of Naval War.  If you're interested in a simulation or any sort of historical accuracy the mixed fleet nationality is going to bug you.  But it's loads of fun to play.

A big step up from Naval War but not as interesting as Corsairs. Ahistoric fleet makeups and the 'circling vultures' waiting to take the last point scored for the kill tarnish a good game.

A card game themed on Age of Sail naval actions. 
Just seemed to miss. Liked the "moving" event card - if you dodged the cannonball the next player may not. 
Did not care to have a mix of ships for your play from opposing nationalities.
Prefer Manuovre's approach we each force has it's characteristics and you must make the best of it. Or Atlantic Storms approach where you fight several engagements alternating sides as the case be.

This game usually ends up giving me no chance at winning, but recently, I played it with 3 other people, and I won by them trying to capture my ships and instead I took their ships, which was hilarious. I won without actually playing cards to board someone else's ships (and I won quite convincingly).

Pretty dreadful.  I gave my copy away.  I just couldn&#039;t accept all the weird things that happened.  The theming was acheived by naming units rather than by mechanics - kind of like Star Wars snap or something.

Though I haven't played this in years, it accounted for a lot of fun time for our regular roleplaying/wargaming group during high school. There can be a bit too much individual downtime in large groups, but if played while watching a movie or otherwise being social, that's not a huge problem (and it's a lot of fun blasting other people's ships to flinders).

I had the opportunity to play this game at the "Gathering of Strangers" (Utah Game Con) in 2006.  At first I was a little dubious as there were a couple of items that were explained that didn't make much sense to me (Break the Line in particular) however I after seeing it in action it wasn't as complex as the expanation seemed to be.  Even after seeing it I don't know how easy it would be to re-explain it however.  I had a great time playing it however and for a card game this one really excels and gives a true feeling of that age of naval combat.  I enjoy it a bit more than Plunder.

The multinational ship lineup thing feels a little silly to me as linebreaking and nationality is a core concept.  Way to luck heavy, you can spend the entire game screwed waiting for a card to leave port or turn over a red card and suddenly bam, thats it.  Gameplay is very take that but feels sloppier than games do it better.  Considerably longer than I would like a light filler game to be.  It's all about how you draw the cards and not how you play the game.

After toying around with this some and reading up on it some more, it looks like this will simply be too long for being a card game. There are other ways I'd rather spend two hours, and there are other card games I enjoy more. I'll try to hold out for a play, but it's up for trade due to the unlikelihood of that happening.

[Played with 4] Feels like a blend of Mag-blast and Naval War.  Easily better than Naval War, but worse than Mag-blast.  The overall game is decent and fairly interesting, but certain aspects seem very unbalanced and unpolished.

The red cards are already bad enough in that they randomly cause something bad to happen to you - but you ALSO lose your turn when you have one.  This really bothered me, even though I was only hit by one of them myself.  My other main complaint is that the 'break the line' cards seem very overpowered.

[90-120 minutes]

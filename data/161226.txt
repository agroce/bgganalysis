Such a fun game in a small package! I was already interested in the Builders: The Middle Ages. Then I saw the preview of this one and I bought Antiquity instead, because I thought the extra elements that it brings to the table would add depth, more options and better replayablilty. I can say, I was no wrong!

The Builders: Antiquity offers the experience of a light resource management game in a perfectly portable package. It has simple but interesting mechanics, it's quick, it's challenging enough and it has amazing artwork! I love that the building cards show the building in the work on one side and the completed one on the other! All together it's a very fun and satisfactory game and it gives you the feeling of playing a boardgame, while fitting in a pocket!

Loved the original game, but this one adds interesting actions.  Most notably the fact that it's easier to complete buildings with less workers, thus prompting a grander planning where you can be even more economical in your action selection.  Better than the original!

We like it a lot, especially with 2 players (where you can plan ahead more). The rules are very simple but it is a complex game to master. Oh my... these last few rounds when you think you can do more than 3-4 actions but you run out of cash. So frustrating!

Like Harbour and Tiny Epic Kingdoms, this one ultimately fell flat for us, because although the mechanics were kind of cool, the decisions were ultimately unsatisfying. Gameplay seemed TOO simple, TOO "clean" to be rewarding. There is little real difference in choices to be made, so I'm never thinking "Oh! I really want THAT card!"

It is Builders but with the addition of loans and tools and education and slaves. The slaves may be a tad overpowered possibly? But I like the fact that they added enough new elements to spice up the game and make you think about your options.

I don't think I enjoy this version of the game as much as I like the original.

I like the concept of the expansions, but all four of them add a level of complexity to the game that I don't think it really needed. I think I might like this version of the game if the four expansions were more fleshed out and you picked a certain number of them in every game.

I do like it, but there's one flaw for me. It feels unnecessarily complex with the whole employing 1 worker costs 1 action while the second worker costs 2 action etc. Once you throw that in, the level of bookkeeping required for what is otherwise a very simple game is annoying.

Very similar to the original Builders game.   Pick workers and plans from a card row and then be the most efficient at reaching a certain number of points.   The transparency overlays here feel a bit like an unnecessary gimmick since the tools work in a very similar way and those are just regular cards.  I liked the tension of the loans and prisoners in terms of how they can affect your points negatively but also tempt you in terms of their bonuses.  The good art and presentation help the overall package.

The Builders: Antiquity takes the gameplay of Middle Ages and expands on it the right way.  The game seems even more tight and each action feels more important than previously.

Family game - resource management
Nice little game, light, but with meaningful decisions, and great artwork. It is a good play for a quick evening game, or super for traveling. The whole concept is good, and it is entertaining. Never overstays its welcome (lasts usually 30-35 minutes). Good with 2p! Good as a family game (however we use the slaves as normal workers in this case, and leave out the loans, cause these would be too complicated for the boys). Recommended!

Az a néhány új lehetőség, ami a középkorhoz képest van, javára válik, bár továbbra is érzek némi fapadosságot az egész hangulatban. A műanyag pénzek kimondottan igénytelenek szerintem. A munkás taníttatása remek ötlet, csak kicsit macerás a kártyán kártyát menedzselni. A rabszolgavásárlás és -felszabadítás jó ötlet, sokat számít, a szerszám annyira nem tűnik izgalmasnak. Mindenesetre a két Építőmesterekből egyértelműen ez a jobb.

the idea of upgrading your workers by sliding transparent sheets over them is a nice gimmick, but the gameplay is rather lame. There is not much interaction, and just feels flat. The box is nice metallic though and easy to carry. But so are lots of other games. No arc, no gruelling decisions, every card is nerfed, it's like patience. French game designers are a kind to avoid, but YMMV.

Eh. The Builders: Middle Ages is an okay (in some ways, Splendorish) simple game. Antiquity is largely the same: what it adds are like patches to the original. In the original it was easy to get stuck if you had no money - so you can take loans here. Also you can take risk with buying prisoners whom you can liberate later (well, they were slaves in the original edition of Antiquity, then Five Tribes happened). Also you can buy tools and upgrades to workers, and these are all available from the begining. All the changes are there to improve the game and yes, there are more things to consider now; however I'm not sure that does improve on the original by much. And if it does not, then I prefer simpler rules, thank you.

You are racing to get to 17 victory points to trigger the game end.  You gather workers to build buildings that score you points and provide money.  The money you use for investments that you can assign to workers they help you build buildings.  Once someone triggers the end game 17, points, the player with the most points wins.  

I like the art and it is a cute, quick little filler game.

A small sized game, that is nevertheless very strategic.

Great components (plastic coins that actual feel like coins, etc..), with game mechanics that actually are related to the theme (recruiting workers, paying them, sending them to work on building projects, etc..).

01/04/17 Received.
03/07/17 Played a three-player game in 66 minutes. My view is this game could never be played in the 30 minutes stated on the box side, unless by only two people who were *extremely* experienced with it. This is not a big thing, but I do wonder how the publisher came up with that figure.  A *much* more important negative point; the small typeface in the rule book. I know the box is small, but come on! They should have either made the box larger to include a larger formatted rule book. Or increased the pages of the rule book and use a larger typeface, with less text on each page. Lastly, oh come on, Prisoners? That need to be freed? They're obviously slaves; just call them that. Political correctness run amok.  
 
As to the positives - I think its a well designed game.  The theme all makes sense.  (Unlike Splendor, which several here have compared it to, where you just find polished jewels lying around and pick them up?!?) Nor do I agree with a couple of people who said TB:A is multi-player solitaire. True, the interaction is indirect (e.g. taking buildings or workers you think others will want).  But you do need to keep an eye on the other players. The graphics and artwork on the cards is well done and very clear. The rules seem quite complete.  Overall I'm very happy with it.

Final note: it may be mostly a card game, but it does take up a good deal of table space with four players. Not a plus or minus, just something to be aware of.

Nice little tableau-builder, has a tiny bit more luck-factor than I really like, but still more to think about than Builders: Middle Ages. Weight is about the same as Port Royal, but lacks that games charisma. B:A feels a tiny bit scripted - get a tool (two if you can), hire some workers, then hope the right buildings come out and your artisans are quickest. It's hard to see the game going differently. Play is reasonably brisk though, and it's good to have in the mix. 
Cards are nice. The small package makes this a good games night candidate.

The game makes me think of Splendor on steroids. It's definitely a difficult game, so advanced players won't enjoy playing with beginners. Ideally you want to learn it along with your group of players. There's a ton of things to keep track of, so I don't recommend it if your group has players who suffer from Analysis Paralysis.

The game looks and feels really nice and can be super fun, once everyone around becomes comfortable with all the mechanisms involved.

The Builders: Middle Ages & Antiquity are two of my favorite games.  They are mostly strategy, with maybe just a little bit of luck.  They are great games for exposing players to the art of project management where the one who chooses, manages, and completed his projects most efficiently ends up the victor.  What I like best is that players enjoy seeing thru the construction of their own projects, and generally don't get messed up by the actions of their opponents.  So whether you win or lose, the game is still aq lot of fun.  You don't get hard feelings toward your opponents.  In fact, I othen want to give suggestions to the opponents to help them with their construction just to help them out a bit.

I was VERY impressed by this game. It's like a bit of a meatier Splendor, and I really like the theme. The artwork is gorgeous and the game just really did it for me. Awesome.

Adds a few elements to the first game and for the better. Fewer worker cards means efficiency more critical. Must use tools and universities to boost laborers. Use prisoners for free labor. Loans not so attractive as you have to pay off debt or loose points.

[Asmodee 2015 edition] {Middle Age; card-drafting, set-collection, action-point allowance; optimal 3p} Builders: Antiquity is better sequel.  I prefer antiquity theme. It provides more tactical options, and have a nice upgrade mechanism with great-looking cards.  In addition, it's shorter than the Middle Age.

The game is quite easy to teach but it takes little time to explain the action point clearly.

The card illustration and the coins are great.  It's fun and thematic.  The upgrade cards are clever.  I love it.

This is very similar to The Builders: Middle Ages, to the point where I was discouraged from getting it because I already have the older game but I was able to get a copy in trade under the idea I would leave a copy at the in laws for when we travel out there. But it actually is different enough that it stands on it's own.

This is a strange product. Usually when you release a "sequel" to an older game (The Builders: Middle Ages) you change up the gameplay in some sort of way to make them different enough to warrant owning both. This game has the exact same gameplay as the older game except it adds a few extra elements, thus making the older game obsolete.

With that said, I like it a lot. The other Builders game basically replaced Splendor for me because of the similar gameplay, so if you like Splendor definitely give this one a try.

It's a simple engine-building game, and with this version there is now more to think about on each turn because of the added elements (take out loans, educate your workers to make them work better, buy tools to use, or buy prisoners who are more efficient but give you negative points). Quite a lot of game in such a small package.

Fun little game. It's Splendor on steroids! There's a lot here for such a small game. The funny thing is, the tin box is it comes in is super small, but the game takes up a descent amount of table space.

Quick and fun game, with enough decision making to be noob friendly yet complex enough to be challenging. Love the theme.

I thought the Middle Ages was fun but this is different but just as fun to play. The new cards and abilities are easy to learn and add a whole new game play. Less workers but you can help them get better by education cards and you can buy simple tools to help you. You now have prisoners who you can buy but free them later in the game. You can take loans out but have to pay them back at a 50% rate before the game end or suffer a penalty. The art work is great. Highly recommend game, a must buy. I hope they bring out a lot more in this line of games.

Card game of constructing recipes for variations of historic structures from the Antiquities.  Drafting for set collection of resources, laborers, and artisans. Art work and game play are inviting but there isn't enough going on to be compelling.

A nice, light little engine-building game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

It bogs down considerably as players are trying to optimize their actions and the extra actions they can buy. It's a kind of optimization/accounting i'm less eager to do nowadays and especially for a game i consider light. It's a game i would only play with 2 because of the downtime with more players but at the same time there are so many better games for 2.

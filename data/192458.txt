"51. Stan: Master Set" to ciekawa pozycja dająca wiele możliwości podczas rozgrywek. Każda frakcja jest odmienna i sprawia, że musimy wykazać się inną strategią aby odnieść zwycięstwo. Ciekawe i staranne ilustracje dodają dodatkowego klimatu całości. Jest to bardzo udana gra z bogatym światem przedstawionym, czytelną mechaniką, dużą regrywalnością i dobrze wykonaną zawartością. Doskonale nadaje się na imprezy, wciągając graczy na długie godziny emocjonującej rozgrywki. Z niecierpliwością wyczekuję kolejnych pozycji z pod szyldu 51. Stan i życzę emocjonujących rozgrywek w świecie brudu, krwi i rdzy. Gorąco polecam.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Imperial Settlers is one of my favorite games of all time, so I was pretty excited to try 51st State as well. The theme doesn't do much for me, as I don't particularly like the Mad Max style post-apocalyptic genre, but I knew that I would enjoy the mechanisms..

and I did! 51st State packs the same exciting engine building system that you can find in Imperial Settlers. I love how every hand is a puzzle, where you have to figure out how to combine the cards you have to get the best outcome. This concept is even stronger in this version of the system, because every card has 3 possible uses, where Imperial Settlers only had 2 on a given card. This is so much fun.

However, I have to admit that I prefer Imperial Settlers by a mile. Sure, the factions in 51st State are asymmetrical, but they felt quite seamy to me. I missed the Faction Decks of Imperial Settlers a lot. I can see however, how someone might prefer this game over his little brother... especially for those who are too concerned with the balance of the game (not that Imperial Settlers is unbalanced anyway). However, there's one mechanism I really don't like in 51st State: the contact tokens. I feel like they just add one more - kinda unnecessary - step to the whole engine. It slows the game down and I'm not sure it adds any level of strategy.

So... 51st State is a great game and one I would gladly play every time. I enjoy the challenge that the game poses and the fascinating puzzle that it offers. However, given the choice, I would ALWAYS pick Imperial Settlers over this one. I love the Faction Decks and I also like the cute civilization theme better. Good game, but his little brother wins.

A clean, fast-playing tableau builder with an enjoyable theme.  The engine-building and running is tight enough to keep things tense, and, at least in my group, there's no multiplayer solitaire problem (= we can play aggressively). New York seems a little understrength so far.

Definitely a fun tableau builder, with multiple uses for cards. Though there is some interaction, it feels like it doesn't have THAT much impact on the game. You probably want to save up some guns to make sure you can kill a VP engine, but for the most part you are just digging and looking for cards that synergize.

A combination of the original 51st State and Portal Games hit Imperial Settlers, the 51st State Master is the best of both. It combines the ease of play from Settlers with the theme and mechanics of 51st State. The cards are easy to read with simple iconography and awesome art. 51st State 's major drawback was the uber-fiddly scoring that was taking place at the end of each and every round. With Master Set you score points as you go until a threshold is reached then the card scoring takes place. It's the best of this series so it's highly recommended.

Very happy to finally own this, I specifically held out for the new version, and was rewarded to find that it also includes New Era and Winter expansions within the box. I cannot compare it to its predecessor, but I do dig the theme here slightly more than Imperial Settlers. The rules are quite similar, you're heading towards a specific point total by gathering resources, building structures into your State and there's also an element of conflict and dealing with other players. Artwork and presentation here are great, and I'd give it the edge of the IS base game, but with the Atlanteans and other expansions that one might gain the edge, and it has a theme which would be more accessible. However, when your spouse, partner or casual gamer friends head home (or to bed) for the evening, break out this version instead for those hardcore apocalyptic buddies that remain.

I have a slight preference to this over Imperial Settlers, I think. In particular, the length of this game feels just about right (managed a two player in about one hour), whereas the five rounds of Imperial Settlers is one too long IMO (and shortening it to 4 apparently hampers the Romans too much). Having said that, there is probably a little more luck in the draw of cards in 51st State and if you are really unlucky and just get no synergy between the goods you produce and the VP cards you draw, it would be very tough! It hasn't happened particularly yet though and so far I am loving this game.

RATING: 3
Not my type of game at all. It looks nice and is obviously mechanically sound, but it's a multiplayer solitaire for the most part. You typically don't care what other players are doing. Drafts pretend there's an interaction going on, but you're simply picking the best card for yourself, there's no point in reacting to somebody else's strategy, because you don't really interact (unlike in other drafting-centered games, where there is majority or cross-player set collection going on). I can imagine that there can be games in which you attack one another, but - again - this is not the type of interaction I'm interested in. I'm more into indirect interaction; don't kill me, don't loot me, don't interfere with whatever I've already accomplished; go and interfere with whatever's available for grabs. All in all it is an engine-builder, whoever does something more optimally will win. You wait for your turn, 90% of time other players' turns don't matter to you anyway. Maybe once in a while you'll ask to be reminded about available open production buildings. It's an epiphany of almost pointless conversion one resource to another, only to convert them to VPs at the end. Hundreds other games do it well better (imo) and at the same time introduce meaningful interaction which makes you feel you're actually playing in a group of people, not by yourself.

Initial Impression: Despite having too many card/tableau games in my collection, when I saw the components for this game splayed out on the table I was compelled to get it. The wooden bits are amazing and the artwork conveys the post apocalyptic theme. Mechanisms support the theme as well. The simple Lookout card drafting phase melds nicely with the resource scrounging in the Production phase. The Action phase, where the meat of the game rests, provides you many grueling decisions about how to use your multipurpose cards most efficiently. As you build up your State, you will experience a tangible development and progression. I enjoy that the endgame is triggered by the players rather than a set number of turns, as timing becomes another important decision. Even the solitaire variants are compelling. Overall, I'm very impressed with the game and glad that my son has also been hooked as this means it's sure to get to the table.

Epitome of an 8 based on the scale here at BGG. Part of the beauty of any tabletop game is its ability to be and exist as its own thing. This game though named for a predecessor and having a current title inspired by that game, is able to stand on its own. Solid card interaction, good player involvement, plenty of strategic options a D scarcity of resources combine with top notch materials and production to equal a worthy package. The game is pretty harsh on solo, and so much more engaging and deeper in multi-player I feel confident in the score as is,  also I recognize that the ceiling is high depending on incoming expansion. Very glad to own this one.

Preemptive comment based on 2 solo plays with base game only (once as a learning game & once with solo variant.) Plenty to chew over here with a healthy dose of decision making and lots of potential with the main multiplayer game. First impressions were that New York is a weaker faction - certainly more difficult to get scoring. New York faction, conversely, ramped up a nice scoring engine in no time. I hope this game is balanced and that the expansions up the 'wow factor'. I'll update this comment really soon, once I try it out in multiplayer.

12-30-16: Second play in the books. It's still a good game but this is the second time, in as many games, that the Appalachian Faction has had a runaway victory. It just seems to be much easier for them to obtain construction tokens. 

Has the potential to affect how long this game will remain in our collection. 

8-14-17: Played several more times, but even with the different expansions, the game begins to feel the same. Downgraded to an 8.

1-6-17: Three player game was good but still seems to drag onnnnnnnnnnnn. Downgraded again; this time to a take it or leave it.

Excellent version of the game compared to the original, wasn't much conflict in the game but then again in the original there wasn't either.  Like the theme and mechanics better than Imperial Settlers because no one faction feels like they are innately overpowered .  Highly enjoyed the game and the engine building of getting production up and then turning it into points is always fun.

So my Secret Santa got me this for the 2016 BGG Exchange and it is awesome. I really enjoyed Imperial Settlers, but 51st State seems to be way more suitable for my group. The more aggressive nature paired with being a quicker game makes me think this will see a ton of play.

RATING: 8
Another nice thing about this is that with fewer players (3 is a good number for this one - I think every player after that is going to make the game worse), it's pretty quick - 60 minutes or so. But it can be an AP trap for some players. Like Istanbul, you've got to get this thing done in an hour for it to be fun.
---
Tentatively positive rating for this one. I like that it's reduced a lot of the persnickety complexity of both the original 51st State and Imperial Settlers. The shared draw deck with asymmetric player boards is a much better solution than the individual decks from Imperial Settlers, and the icon situation is much better than the original 51st State (which I liked a lot, but the difficulty of the presentation is a serious issue). The loss of the "rule of 3" from the original 51st State is unfortunate; that was the key mechanic that made the original interesting and unusual and was a clever way to solve some of the inherent issues with tableau-builders. But I guess people found it confusing.

I liked 51st State despite the major presentation issues, and did not care for Imperial Settlers. 51st Master Set is somewhere in-between; it's not as good from a core mechanics perspective as 51st State, but it is much more playable and accessible due to the improved iconography and graphic design. It's much better (IMO) than Imperial Settlers. I like it, but because the original 51st State exists, it's hard for me not to wish that it had hewed more closely to the original game - cleaning up the graphic design and killing off some of the more excessive mechanisms (like leaders), but keeping the main thing that made the game interesting and unique (the "rule of 3").
---
I enjoyed this game, but OMG the rules are a flaming car wreck. Thankfully the game isn't super-complicated, but wow. Just, wow. Anyway, I do think it finds a nice spot between the original 51st State (which I liked) and Imperial Settlers (which I was lukewarm on).

Very similar to Imperial Settlers.  I think it's definitely more complex with the additional step of needing to covert to connections.  Although the same cost of the three main actions (build/deal/raze) helps.  I like the difference that there is no faction cards.  Card management is not as big a deal as you don't have to decide between getting faction cards or generic cards.  

Good game, still too early for me to see which is preferred. Thematically I probably like the whimsical nature of imperial settlers more.

The New Era expansion definitely improves this game a little bit. Could be an 8, I suppose, but I'd have to play more. I haven't checked the Winter expansion yet. Today I played with an expansion for a first time and I was positively surprised with the game. New cards open a path for many interesting decisions.

I'd love to see more interaction here, as well as more diversified fractions which vary not only in terms of production and resources' exchange values. The game itself works very well, being a satisfying engine builder. Sadly cards lack any interesting abilities and are just variations of "spend X and Y to gain Z", but I understand that is the purpose of the game, forcing players to create the most efficient engine. The distance element is great(and thematic) and the fact that you can use EVERY card in three possible ways creates a lot of possibilities. 

I think removing the rule that you can build new locations upon the ruins could definitely improve the interaction between players, although the Mutant fraction would probably become too strong. Now attacking has it rewards, but its a double edged sword which sometimes helps your opponent even more than yourself.

These minor issues take away the fun part a little bit, making the game too much multiplayer solitaire, a thing that I don't like very much in board games. Nevertheless, it's still probably one of the best engine builders available, and fans of such type of games won't be disappointed. It works very well as a replacement for Terraforming Mars, as it offers similar feelings but in a much shorter time(45 min versus 3 hours!), which is definitely an advantage.

RATING: 10
Played 5+ x
It feels like a more balanced New Era, and definitely much, much easier to teach. I still like New Era a bit more, maybe for nostalgia more than anything else. 

I have no complaints about this game whatsoever. It's fun, it works at a variety of player counts, all the factions play a bit differently (but your strategy is mostly determined by the cards you see) for lots of variety. The better player will win all the time. But even if you lose, it's still fun to build and optimize engines. 

It's not a multiplayer solitaire game--you can (and generally should) attack and disrupt other player's engines. But the costs of attacking can be high and the costs of being attacked are...not that great. So it's a careful decision when you should attack, who to use it on, and what buildings to target. 

It also has a form of interaction that I particularly like in games--where player A pays player B to use part of their engine. (See also: Keyflower). It's built into the game so there's no lengthy bargaining process like in games that allow for trading. But it's a quid pro quo exchange that works like trading.

I love tableau/engine builders. This is probably the best one I've played yet! 

I really like that the cards make more sense thematically than most other tableau/engine builders. Also, a lot of tableau/engine builders can feel like multiplayer solitaire but this one allows players to destroy each other's cards which is fantastic! It's one of the first games where the direct conflict doesn't ever feel as "mean" as other games. In this game if someone destroys one of your cards you still get something from it which is great. Being able to draft and hate draft is another thing I love in card games and there's some of that in this one as well.

There is some asymmetry here but the game actually feels very balanced. I also love the end-game scoring because the game plays pretty quickly and if a player just so happens to be destroying you, well at least the game will end sooner compared to Imperial Settlers where the game goes to 5 rounds no matter what.

I love that the game comes with 2 different expansions so you can always change it up depending on mood helping to keep the game fresh. Loads of replayability here!

I have wanted to dip my hands into 51st State since forever.  It was always available, mind you, but I'd done my research and saw that there was some stuff that didn't quite match up when you put it together with New Era (which was much harder to find) and the clashing icons would just confuse everyone.  And then Imperial Settlers came out and everyone told me to go get that because it was a rethemed 51st State, but dammit, the theme is what I LIKE!  I don't care about farms, goddam it!  So I sat on the fence for the longest time until Ignacy randomly tweeted that he was toying with the idea of a collected set.

So I waited patiently and was tremendously rewarded.  While it's very clear that some thematic elements of the original two sets (plus the impossible-to-find Winter expansion) are gone, the overall result is a very efficient streamlining of the originals with a unified icon set and cards that say what they do rather than try to show you what they do.  The end result is a wonderful tableau-building game with just a dash of aggressiveness that makes it a treat to play.

Overall, the game is pretty much the same as it ever was - the art is untouched, you still have the option to make deals, build, or raze, and the theme is still there.  It's unfortunate that the theme sort of takes a backseat (it really only comes out if you read what you're doing aloud - otherwise you could, yes, be building farms), but ultimately it doesn't matter because the gameplay is solid.  Again, like I said, some of the stuff that brought the theme out more in the originals is missing, but at the same time, it's been boiled down to your faction boards and everything just clicks together well.

Other than some rules ambiguity (despite the wonderful sense of humor the rulebook has), I am absolutely happy to have this after waiting so long.  While I prefer the overall graphic design of the originals (it all just looks cooler, man), everything here has been made sleek and functional and nobody has to guess what anything does.  Your tidbits match the icons so you'll inevitably be calling "iron" bits as "gears" etc, but it leaves no room for confusion.  It plays quick and never strays too far from that sweet spot.

The Master Set includes the base set, New Era, and Winter all in one convenient package (albeit streamlined for the new edition), but no Hegemony faction.  No matter.  On the plus side, all faction boards can be flipped for gender preference; cosmetic, yet inclusive!

Side note: Sleeve this game.  Cards are basic stock and will wear quickly.

For me, this is the best iteration of the deal/raze/play card system that was seen in the old 51st State, New Era, Imperial Settlers and now this one. I didn't like in Imperial Settlers how you played to a set number of rounds and the rounds got progressively longer. With the snowball nature of the engine you build, usually Imperial Settlers felt like it was one round too long with one player running away with it. In addition, with Imperial Settlers, it was easier for players to use all of their resources each round since there is no additional step of transforming resources into contact tokens. The unique deck was interesting in IS, but it was annoying when you didn't draw the key cards of your faction. So, I prefer the slightly asymmetric factions in 51st State MS compared to IS. I'm sure there are definitely people who prefer IS for a number of reasons, but not me.

Even though this is the best this system has to offer, there are still other tableau-building games that I would rather play. I'm finding it hard to really say why this system just doesn't really click the way I want it to.

I've played this 2 player a few times with Gabriel. It really shines in three-player and I've enjoyed some great games in that format. I like the way the various resources all work together in a complicated, yet interesting, engine and how the race really heats up by round 3, and the game tends to be over by round 4 at the latest.

I played this with new players at LFG and it really shone.

Have now played this game at least 4-5 times, seen more play-through videos.  This is definitely a game for me as it combines card drafting, action selection, card play, and worker placement , all in one game.  The apocalyptic theme is OK, but definitely not the biggest draw in this game for me.  Instead, it's the mechanics of this game, including the "chaining" you can do in it.

Very fun engine builder. I love the art, clean card layout, clear iconography, and the wooden resources. This game got better with more plays.

Official solo rules are too easy and don't capture the feel of the multi-player game very well.

At 2 players the incentive to use your opponent's open production facilities diminishes.

At 4 players it gets quite hard keeping track of what's going on in other people's tableaus.

A great tableau/engine building game that can be a little overwhelming at first due to the large number of different resources and tokens.

RATING: 5
Initial impression:

Well designed engine builder, enjoy the multi use cards. However, engine builders are becoming less interesting for my taste. I don't find the tightness in the economy that I enjoy. Not enough interaction in the game play to excite me about going back. You have the ability to 'attack' opponents, but this has not felt has much impact in the games I've played. Will give a few more tries before deciding if there is something I've missed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A little too euro-y for me, given the theme. (Not sure why, considering how I used to love Dominion.) I had fun playing it, but it didn't make me want to go back for more. Part of it felt like the factions were a little too much on rails--the decisions didn't feel that interesting, mostly going for what your faction set you up for. Felt like whenever I wanted to go off script I was punished for it, so I -had- to play the obvious choice each time. 

The game does go by quickly, which I suppose is a plus, though for me, I was hoping for something a little meatier.

Sold and haven't regretted it.

Certainly a regrouped, updated, and much better version of the original and its expansions.  The wooden bits were nice.  A few for the contacts and bullets and it might have made this a "deluxe" version. The updated artwork is really nice and much appreciated.  This game still has a little bit of a clunky feel to it(coming from a RftG fan) but an enjoyable tableau builder. I much prefer the theme and the scoring on this one because it ends before the later rounds become too protracted.

Preliminary rating after four plays: Slightly quicker than Imperial Settlers but also  less enjoyable. Resource management (with 10 commodities in contrast to only 6 in IS) is more complicated while the diversity coming from the asymmetrical set up is missing.  Actions cards are rather arbitrary.

What bugs me most is, that the factions ins 51stState are all more or less alike. It doesn't really matter which one you play. Compare that to IS where (for instance) the Barbarians need a completely different strategy than the Japanese.
 
Bottom line: People who own (and love) Imperial Settlers (like I do) don't need 51st State. It doesn't improve any aspect of IS. 

 Sold my copy.

„A világégés után”
Már a szabálymagyarázat közben nagyon ismerős volt a játék, hiszen játszottam a későbbi megjelenésű Birodalmi telepesek társassal, amely hasonló játékmechanizmusokat használ. Így jó volt megismerkedni az előddel is, főleg, mert egyrészt a poszt-apokaliptikus téma, másrészt annak grafikai megvalósítása is tetszik.
Az államban 2-4 fő vezet különböző frakciókat és hajt 25 győzelmi pontra. Minden körünkben lapokat kapunk, termelünk, majd akciókat hajtunk végre (építés, fejlesztés, fosztogatás, kereskedelmi kapcsolatok, megépített lapok akciói, …) és győzelmi pontokat szerzünk ezekkel. Az akciókat egyesével egymás után hajtjuk végre, ameddig az összes játékos nem passzol. Utána minden megszerzett erőforrást, jelzőt eldobunk, kivéve, ha nem tudjuk megépített lapjainkon tárolni és már jön is a következő kör. Amikor valaki eléri a 25. pontot, az jelenti, hogy abban a körben még végrehajtjuk az összes lehetséges akciót és megnézzük a végső pontértékeket, amelyek alapján kihirdetjük a győztest.
A lapok szövegezése angol, így nyelvtudás szükséges a játékhoz.
Az első körökben még lassabban pörögnek az események, majd minél több termelésed és akciólehetőséged lesz, úgy lesznek hosszabbak a játékosok fordulói. Mindenképpen pár játék kell hozzá, hogy az amúgy könnyen megtanulható/elsajátítható alapakciókon felül megismerd a játék kártyáit. Az már személyfüggő, hogy ki mennyit olvasgatja a lapokat és gondolkozik azon mit használjon fel és hogyan (főleg a játék végén, amikor már sok lehetőséged van).
A rombolási lehetőségek miatt a játék 2 fővel ajánlott, nincs mást „szívatni” és „királyt csinálni”. 
A Birodalmi telepesek is tetszett, ezt is merem ajánlani kipróbálásra.

RATING: 8.5
Contrary to what others will say, it is very similar to Imperial Settlers. Of course, Imperial settlers was based on the original 51st State. The big difference between imperial settlers and this new 51st state is that there is no faction specific cards. Everyone use the same pool of cards. 

Now to the game it self, I've never played the original but have played and own Imperial settlers. I love this game, like imperial settlers. Is it different enough to justify owning both? I'd say for fan yes, but it will be a bit redundant. 

Now which is better? This will depends on you. I appreciate the theme of both games and the gameplay so I'm hard pressed to pick one over the other.

RATING: 8
An excellent update that fixes most of what was wrong with the previous edition (all those tiny tokens) but does have a few niggling foibles of its own.

Core gameplay is of the fairly standard Euro 'get stuff to do other stuff' variety, but several things set 51st State apart.

First, the multi-use cards give players a lot of options each turn, and a lot of flexibility about how they build their state.

Second, the fact that you get the resources buildings and deals generate when you play them means you can create long 'combos', playing card A to get the stuff that will allow you to play card B, which will let you score VPs from card C, and so on. I'm not very good at that part tbh, but I've seen better players than me have crazily good rounds by chaining stuff together.

Turns are quick and the game wraps up in just the right amount of time. It's usually slow-scoring to begin with, then someone gets their VP engine going and races for the finish line. Which is when you should decide to raid their state and burn down their VP scoring cards. Which is a cool thing you can do.

It's not spectacularly interactive outside those infrequent aggressive moments, there's a spot of hate drafting, but it's more along the lines of keep an eye on your opponents and match (or better still outmatch) their pace, rather than actively swiping their stuff or messing with their plans.

I like it quite a bit. I was worried that the not including the Rule of Three from first edition was a mistake but never give its absence a second thought now. I do miss leaders a bit.

As to its niggles, I think Open Production locations should be much easier to identify from across the table. And the contact tokens could have been much more thematic, they're called raiders and builders and what not, but they're just arrows. Why not stick pictures on them? Would have made the game easier to explain too.

Oh, and the rulebook. Don't get me wrong, it's good at teaching the game. Especially compared to the first edition, which is one of the worst  I've ever read. But the constant attempts at humour are horrible, spectacularly unfunny and a waste of words. Imagine being trapped on a tourist sightseeing coach with a tour guide who thinks he's a comedian. It's pretty excruciating.

I possibly couldn't put it better than Veridiana did: 'It's just a shadow of the game I used to know...'.

It's a coherent and playable reprint (or redesign, rather) with good graphics and production quality.  Dynamic, fluid and reasonably quick.  Not devoid of emotions.  But...

The first problem is the name.  It's NOT a Master Set.  This is a joke.  Substantial changes and simplifications place this NEW design somewhere between the original 51st State and Imperial Settlers.

Secondly, the game was castrated to the point it became a lifeless, generic shell.  Any setting can be used as a replacement for postapo world.

Finally, only the most elementary abilities were left on the cards.  This is disturbing, and most of all, boring.
 
The game is bland.

Had it been relased before its predecessors, it would've deserved a praise.  But right now, it just pales in comparison to the original and Imperial Settlers.
If you need to get rid of 1 of 3, make it '51st State: Master Set'.

Definitely one of the best engine builders I've played and very quick pace with 2 or 3 players. The resource conversion from raw materials (cogs, guns, fuel) to contact tokens makes it challenging to execute your plan. What's also great about the game is how fast it ramps up, the game will usually end in the 4th round of play and it's satisfying to see your engine humming and churning out points.

This game is so much fun! One of my favorite, if not my favorite tableau/engine-building games. I didn't expect to like it to be honest. Post apocalyptic Mad Max style themes are not really my cup of tea. I've only played with two but have had a blast every time. Plenty of strategies to try. The sides are asymmetric and guide you to a strategy but you're not locked in there. It is possible to win without capitalizing on the strength of the faction, though it's harder to do so of course. I'd really like more factions.

Definitely a winner!

Expansions owned: Scavengers, additional factions, Three Cities, promo card set.

A Birodalmi Telepesek után nagyon könnyű megtanulni a játékot. Jójó, tudom, hogy igazából a 51st State volt előbb, de akkor is. :P

A téma miatt egyértelműen ez vonz jobban, ráadásul szerintem gördülékenyebb is a játékmenet. Amúgy valóban nagy százalékban hasonló a két játék, de az a pár különbség elég ahhoz, hogy mégis más legyen a játékérzet. Itt kapásból nincs saját paklink, így úgymond saját épületünk sem lesz, a factiontábla egy oldalára építkezünk csak, ezáltal viszont nincsenek védett lapjaink, bármelyiket lerombolhatja az ellenfél. Persze ez azt is jelenti, hogy igazából nem teljesen aszimmetrikus játékról beszélünk, mert bár mindenkinek mások a képességei, ez alapvetően csak különböző átváltási arányokat jelent. Persze, valamennyire befolyásolja a játékot, de a stratégiát nem feltétlenül befolyásolja olyan szinten, mint a Birodalmi Telepesekben a saját lapok.
Az is elég nagy különbség, hogy a játék nem fix fordulós, hanem a 25. pont elérése jelzi az utolsó fordulót. Emiatt talán jobban is kell figyelni egymást, mert bizony lehet, hogy az egyik játékos arra számít, hogy majd a következő fordulóban ezt meg azt csinál, de közben az ellenfél meg betolja 25-ig és akkor bizony csúnya vége lehet az egésznek. :)

Úgy érzem alapvetően pörgősebb és rövidebb is, mint a Birodalmi Telepesek, bár kettesben az sem volt vészes. Mindenesetre összességében nekem jobban tetszik a 51st State, szívesen játszom vele bármikor.

U.i.: azért a lapjárás nagyon genyó tud lenni. :D

The original game was hard to grasp but the MS version is simpler (in the original, for instance, VPs went back to zero each turn). The rule book is clear and written in an engagingly insolent and sardonic tone. The key mechanic is that in general you can't stockpile resources. Whatever you don't use you lose (but fear not you get it in production next turn). Great solo game, very thematic, even though it's just a card game. Great artwork. First edition artwork was even better so I have that too, but just to look at. Also have Arctic Scavengers, the sort of winter version.

I really like the way that this game played! I, unlike many others, haven't played Imperial Settlers, but I've heard they are similar. Seeing as how I haven't played the other, I really enjoyed the unique tableau building experience! Although, there is a lot of room for improvement seeing as how I scored in the low 30s in each game and it seems like there is potential to get up to 100!?!? Challenge accepted, looking forward to playing again soon!

Judging this game by its old cover shouldn't be the case. Even though I never played the original, I wouldn't know how to compare it. But, when played this at a gaming group, people seemed to recognize it right away and compared it to the old system. I was emphasizing that this totally new and to give it a try. Even though they didn't tried it at the time, I played it with a couple of new people. I thought it was somewhat easy to teach. What think is a challenge, and think it's a good thing is the limited resources you have at the beginning at the round. As time goes on, you can get more resources into your faction by making a deal with the card. However, don't get too comfortable with all you have, because once everyone passes, you can have almost everything that you saved up, wiped away, like the thugs kept coming to you without looking.   I think that this is a great idea because you can't horde everything, you have to think what is the best way to build your engine on what you got, what you can keep, and what you are going to lose. Most cards look awesome, reminding you that this a place you don't want to be in. Most of the tokens are really cool to have in your hand. However, there should be some type of reminder of the open locations in another person's faction, because if you don't pay attention, you can lose some opportunities to get something you may need. Also, the feel of the game is a solo-ish game where you are concentrating on your own faction. Also, to be honest, things start off slow, but once you start to see what you can do with the cards once you build up your faction, things start to get interesting. Plus, as a good thing, as soon as someone gets closer to the 25 mark, you become more aware that you have to do something, and do it quick to get more points. I could be wrong, but I think there should be a more in your face interaction with the other players. Other than that i think it's a great game once you get your head wrapped around it.

51st State is a card game in which players control one of four powers trying to build a new country. Players put new locations into play, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills. To do this, every card in 51st State can be used in three different ways:

Raze a location to gain many resources once.
Deal with this location to gain one resource every turn.
Build the location so that you can use its skill each turn.
51st State: Master Set marks the rebirth of the 51st State line, with this set containing 88 cards from the original base game, and 50 cards each from both the New Era and Winter expansions; one of these expansions can be mixed with the cards of the base game, but not both at the same time. The entire set has been rebalanced to offer a cohesive experience no matter which expansion you choose to use.

Just love multi use card games. This is especially good as all the factions play differently and have different strengths that makes the cards different depending on faction and tableau. Massive replayability with all the cards and factions. The game is all about the subtle differences that make it differ from other games.

After watching some videos of the original 51st state, I thought my wife and I might like to play it and the Master Set was in preorders at the time.
We have yet to play it. We have tended toward more simple rulesets and quicker gameplay since I preordered.
I attempted the solo rules once and found it very difficult to even get started. It's up on my "for trade" list after not even playing once.

Wow, davon hatte ich mir mehr erhofft!
Am Anfang der Runde werden 8 Karten auf die Hand der Spieler verteilt. Innerhalb der Runde kann man diese Karten als Gebäude bauen, als Deal unter sein Tableau schieben oder für Ressourcen ausplündern.
Der Clou dabei ist, dass am Ende der Runde ALLE Ressourcen abgegeben werden müssen! Zu viel zu produzieren bringt somit nichts, nur Aktionsverlust. Zu wenig und mann nichts tun. Das Gleichgewicht zu finden ist die Lösung!
Leider gefällt mir das Spiel tatsächlich nicht so gut wie ich es erhofft hatte. Jeder Spieler hat immer eine Aktion, dadurch ist die Downtime sehr gering, allerdings sind die Aktionen so Mini (Ressourcen gegen Plättchen tauschen o.Ä.), dass es zu schnell Schlag auf Schlag geht und einem "schwindelig" wird. Was viel gravierender ist, ist, dass man nebeneinander her spielt. Da die Aktionen der Gegner so schnell vorbei sind und ich mit mir selbst beschäftigt bin, bekomme ich von denen gar nichts mit. Da könnte ich es auch Solo spielen und hätte das gleiche, denn Kommunikation ist auch nicht, da man so schnell wieder an die Reihe kommt...
Downtime verringern kann man also auch übertreiben. Sehr schade, hatte so viel Hoffnung für das Spiel.

I've been eagerly anticipating this. I am a huge New Era fan, and don't get as much play of it as I'd like, so a more streamlined game would fit the bill. Imperial Settlers is good, but it's not 51st/New Era/Winter. When the rules were leaked (and eventually revealed) a lot of people, myself included, were worried that this was just a rethemed Imperial Settlers. Even recognizing that IS was based on 51S, a lot of fans feel that there are some things about the original game that got left behind. 

So to answer that question, yeah, this new edition is pretty much IS rethemed. There are a couple of mechanical dissimilarities, but it's more in line with that game than with New Era. I don't blame them; Imperial Settlers has been something of a hit, whereas New Era, well, isn't. Also, Imperial Settlers is, in many ways, an improvement over the old system.

To that end, since more people know about IS, here are the differences:
- no faction decks. Only a common deck.
- resources are primarily used to pay for actions, not to build or deal with locations
- there are three types of "connection" tokens. blues are for making deals (instead of food), red for razing (instead of swords), and gray for building (instead of resources)
- locations have a "distance" that determine how many of the above tokens are needed
- redevelopment (replacing old locations with new ones) is important and grants VPs
- factions have faction-specific actions, but cannot store resources
- Connections cards that you can send workers to get to help with razing and deal-making

Seeing that written down, it's kind of a lot, really.

All of this works well and makes the game much easier to pick up. Fans of IS may like the new theme and differences. For fans of the old game, there's a lot there that will be familiar.

I like the new version and hope it does well. I will miss the "Rule of 3" from the old game, which made decisions trickier, but it's not a deal-breaker. What I actually miss more is that the cards in this edition don't feel particularly thematic. A lot of the setting and personality in the old game doesn't really come through here, as the cards largely blend together. It's also strange to have things like two copies of "Pete's Office" (he has franchises?) in the same deck, or "Slave Traders"/"Bus Station" which are the exact same card with different names. That may change when more cards are released. (I also miss learning French, Polish, and German from the cards. Au revoir, "Bureau de Pete".)

The Master Set comes with a deck of base cards plus two add-in decks (New Era and Winter) that can be used to change up the gameplay. We played with the New Era deck, which seemed like more of the same. I'm eager to try the Winter one and just the base deck to see if this works.

For me, New Era + Winter is still the king of the hill here. This new set won't have me getting rid of those. It may, however, send Imperial Settlers packing. That game seems to be going in a direction of constructing faction decks and such, which I'm not really interested in. I think I'll be able to transition the IS fans in my group to this new 51st State.

While I think New Era + Winter is the pinnacle of the design both mechanically and thematically, the streamlining of the system present in the Master Set is not lost on me. In fact, games are tighter and shorter, which is not a bad thing.

My only concern is if the system forces that tightness. I actually liked being able to blow out my opponents with good play in the older systems. (I hope that makes sense. :) )

I am 1 of the first players in Hong Kong who bought the original 51 state, and the game has been left in dust for sometime. This time the game is bought by James, and the improvements are very obvious, making a game like computer code becomes a gamer's game. The game still lacks a bit of interaction, otherwise this would be a 9.

First impression after one 2p and one 4p game.  Almost MPS with a higher than average degree of interaction between tableaus.  High downtime between turns and near end of round with higher player count (4p).  Players will pass near end of round and are no longer engaged.  Asymmetrical factions that suggest a playstyle without imposing it.  Slow start with snowball/buildup engine that makes end game more exciting than start.  Possible runaway leader.  The main critique is that there are other games that do this type of interactive MPS better, like Terraforming Mars.  The other main critique is that in spite of the relatively low rules overhead it still requires a greater investment of time and learning than is worth.  Good production values, the game has Portal's usual quality and polish, with the little gears, weapons, and other tokens in wood and plastic.  Good iconography, clear and concise rules.

Based on intital 7 plays I like it, seems a bit solitaire like in some respects aside from the drafting and razing, although I like the theme enough to persevere, will get back round to playing it more and see what I think about it then. Found that as a newer player once another deck was added got a bit more involved. Very much an engine building game, can grate a bit when you don't get relevant cards and your opponent does.

Cleans up New Era nicely. Maintains a real tightness in the game. Card draw is less powerful and thus have a card draw bonus over other players does not spell their doom. Overall, I really like the changes they made, and think it is an excellent rendition of an excellent game.

Had New Era, but could never get past the rule book.  Ended up buying Imperial Settlers and fell in love, top 10 game for me.  I was going to pass on this Master Set since I didn't really need two games that were pretty similar.  After reading the rule book, it seemed like the race to 25 points instead of 5 set rounds could make this play out a little differently than Imperial Settlers.  Decided I should try it out.  Sure enough, I'm only a handful of plays into 51st State (no expansions played yet) compared to 30+ for IS, but they feel different enough already.  Right now, I'm still leaning towards IS as being my favorite because there's a lot to consider and learn based on the faction decks, but I can see 51st State really giving it a run for its money.

Update after 15+ plays:  Still very enjoyable.  However, I do not see this passing up Imperial Settlers.  In IS, the different factions play so differently so there is a lot more to explore.

Update after 20+ plays:  Haven't pulled this out very much in 2017 and my interest in playing it is dwindling.  May leave my collection in 2018 unless I can find something in this game that makes it exciting to play.  The resource conversion portion of the game is just not very interesting me (turning goods into tokens, which then can be used to Make Deals, Build, Etc), which kind of brings down the whole game for me.  What's the point?  It doesn't seem to add much to your decision making process so it's just extra filler steps in the game.  

With that said, I still found it enjoyable to play in the beginning.  It just seems like I won't be able to overlook things I perceive as flaws, so not likely a game that stays long term in my collection.

Bought from Kinglsayer Comics with store credit 9/12/16.

We've been loving Tableau builders lately and this one is no exception.  I wish the factions were a bit more asymmetric, but the different exchange rates do have actual effects on strategy.  I really like how the aggression isn't killer here.  Not only does razing get your opponent a resource, it also creates a ruin which can be converted to any card in their hand for a single brick.

Variable player powers, engine building, and player interaction (but not obnoxious take-that spite).  

Plus for some reason, my version came with the special custom preorder components!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Positive: Classic engine builder that does a lot of things right. The artwork is neat, downtime is minimal (without Analysis Paralysis (AP)), and the mechanics are relatively smooth. The factions are not very different, but that is a good thing. They each have advantages in one resource or another, steering a player in that direction, but you are never forced to follow that route. Also, while building your colony, it feels very good when you are able to work your cards out in a way that you don't have too many or too few resources.

Neutral: The game is absolutely meant to be a two-player game. Turns are extremely fast, so it always feels like you need to be involved in the game. However, when you have four players in a game, it is very easy to zone out and not pay attention to what other people are doing because, honestly...it doesn't matter. This is a multiplayer solitaire game with some light player interaction. This is a neutral aspect because I don't mind it. I like building my own colony and trying to make it as efficient as possible. Sometimes I just wish that I needed to care about other people's turns. Another neutral point is the theme. It really isn't all that important. At no point during my plays have I ever felt like I am building a colony. The mechanics are solid, the artwork is fun to look at, but it has no real integrated theme. Again, not a negative, just a neutral.

Negative: If someone put out a bunch of other engine builder games in front of me to play, I don't think I would choose this one. The engine building in this game is very solid and pretty smooth, but there a ton of other games that just do engine building better. I think that Terraforming Mars has a better integration of theme, more interesting drafting choices, and more player interaction. I usually care more about other player's turns. Also, there is something that we are collectively doing and focusing on - Mars - not just our own boards. A second negative of this game is  AP can set in for new and even experienced players. Staring at the huge amount of cards in your hand and in your colony can hurt your brain trying to figure out the right order. The decision making is not the negative, it's the time that it takes to do the decision making. In a two-player game it isn't game-breaking, but in a 4-player game it can REALLY drag the game out to over two hours. For me, that's too long of a playtime for this type of game.

Final Decision: 8/10
I would suggest this game to other people, especially those that, like me, enjoy the grinding of trying to make a system that works efficiently. If someone wants to play it, I probably won't turn it down, but there are definitely other games that I would prefer to play.

[i]Caveat[/i]:  the comments below are based on only playing with the base set of cards; I did not open either of the expansions. 

[u]22-Nov-2016[/u]:  You may not think so when you read the rest of this, but I do like this game, and I did have fun with it.  But it's lighter, quicker, and much more fiddly than I had expected.  If you enjoy resource conversion in games, then this is your jam.  It's a solid game. Just not one that will break into the Core of my collection. 

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  This edition has some great wooden components.  Even the retail version is nice. But here, three of the four resource meeples have additional recesses with a gold color in them. They really make a nice presentation.  The fourth resource (iron) has no differences. But the worker meeples have painted faces.

[b]+[/b]  I like the cards a lot.  They have a boatload of information on them, so at first they seem overcrowded. But after a round or two, they become second nature with clear, easy to read actions and icons.

[b]+[/b]  Along with that, the art is very good.  It has a post-apocalyptic vibe without being violent or gruesome.  Thanks for that. 

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  Oh my, this game is fiddly.  You are constantly moving little wooden meeples and cardboard tokens from the supply to your faction board to a card and back again. Over and over and over.  I gave up after a single round of play and just used the score tracker as a resource tracker. Much simpler and quicker, IMO. 

[b]-[/b]  The theme is almost non-existent for me.  And I normally wouldn't put that in the negatives as I don't mind that so much.  But I know Portal Games is all about games that tell stories. Well, there is absolutely no narrative here.  Its all about generating VPs through resource conversion. 

[b]-[/b]  51st State is a game without limits.  Its setting is post-apocalyptic, but I'm drowning in resources, a few of which I just throw away at the end of every round.  One Action chains to the next action and then to the next and so on.  I feel like my turns are endless with no matter what I choose to do, eventually it will lead me to a VP. This game could use some restrictions for the player. 

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  They should have called this game 51 Resources.  51st State is all about resource conversion.  Change a resource into a card that generates a resource that changes into another resource that becomes a VP. The whole game is about that.  Not good, not bad, just not what I was expecting.

[b]~[/b]  There really isn't much variety from game to game. Yes, you'll need to adjust your strategy on the fly but basically you just collect the resources that match your Location cards that score you VPs.  One game I might focus on bricks and iron, while it might be gas cans in another.  But it's all the same. Only the meeple is different. 

[b]~[/b]  This game is a race to a VP total, its one true comparison to Race for the Galaxy.  It can be over in as little as three rounds, probably, but most likely four or five.  While it's good to have a quick-playing game at the ready, if you want something with more meat and complexity, you need to look elsewhere.

Sometimes you have to eat your words.

I'm a big fan of Imperial Settlers, and I had previously enjoyed my plays of The New Era. Though the latter certainly had its share of fiddly quirks and frustrating rough edges, I still found it extremely satisfying to play. Therefore, I was initially excited for 51st State: Master Set thinking it would simply be an opportunity to get the most complete edition of a game I enjoyed. Then I found out they'd be streamlining the game to the point of removing some of the elements I felt differentiated it from Imperial Settlers. As I said, I'm a big fan of Imperial Settlers, but I couldn't see a reason to own what [i]seemed[/i] like a reskinned version of that game. Also, the rulebook, with its weak attempts at humor, was absolutely horrible. Disappointed, I decided to pass. At least I could play my copy of Imperial Settlers as well as my friend's copy of The New Era.

Then, of course, the game was released and the reviews, for the most part, suggested that in fact this new edition was quite good, that, though the game was certainly streamlined, it still felt like 51st State and was distinct enough from Imperial Settlers to justify its existence. I decided that I'd at least want to play it, which I finally did. I discovered that, dammit, the game is awesome. It's 51st State boiled down to its essential core. I figured I'd miss the excised complexity, but, no, the game somehow captures a similar feel without making you jump through all the same hoops. Most importantly, it does stand on its own. If Imperial Settlers is about building up your faction's engine and maximizing its potential over a fixed period of time, then this new 51st State is about cobbling together whatever will work from the ruins just long enough to make it over the finish line.

EDIT (12/6/16):
Everything above still stands, but I'm dropping my rating simply because I think it was inflated by my initial excitement. This is a solid 8.

Only played once so can't judge too harshly but prefer not to play this one again, frustration won over fun for this one. Like Imperial Settlers but with a different theme. As I was settling in building up an engine to try and take advantage of my characters abilities I just got clobbered by an opponent who had strong military ability and there didn't seem much I could do to counter/defend. Yeah you can get shields, but you can only place them on a specific card and they disappear after that turn (players would just target other buildings) - plus you're building up shields instead of working towards other things that actually get you points. The military character seems OP because not only does their ability advantage them but it disadvantages others, unlike the other characters. I felt helpless to counter/defence without giving up on any chance at decent scoring. The only other thing you can do is pass which makes you not attackable but pretty much wastes the rest of your turn/actions.

Just one play so could be a once-off etc, but felt unbalanced to me. Might be willing to play again if in the right mood but will prefer to avoid it.

I have mixed feelings about this game. The production quality is very good - artwork, pieces, cards is on a plus. In the master set there are already two expansions, and there is lots of cards. What I think I dislike about this game is lack of specialization. I believe more distinct factions, each one with its own deck, would make the game better. Although every game is different, it feels repetitive, and you have to go with the flow. That is, play according to random draw of cards. On the other hand, you can choose from these random cards, so there is some planning. And again, it feels kind of like solitaire, but it is not - you can destroy opponent's building and "steal" cards during lookout phase. For now I give it strong 7, but I am afraid it may leave my collection. It's something between Caverna and Summoner Wars, but seems to lack pros of the two, and mix the cons. Yet it has some cool mechanics that balance 'first player' issues... I'm really torn apart with this one. :) It seems to be better game then I rate it credit, but... time will show.

[edit: I enjoy the game and keep getting back to it. Changing rating to 8]

In einem postapokalyptischen Szenario a la Fallout, müssen die Spieler ihre Fraktion zum Sieg führen. Das Spiel wird komplett über Karten gesteuert, diese kann man auf drei unterschiedliche Arten für sich nutzen. Man kann mit ihnen einen Handel abschließen (Rohstoffproduktion), sie als Gebäude in seinen Staat errichten (unterschiedliche, dauerhafte Effekte) oder sie überfallen (einmalige Beute). Mit den Rohstoffen und Ressourcen, versuchen die Spieler eine möglichst effiziente Produktionskette zu errichten, um den maximalen Gewinn an Siegpunkten zu erzielen. 51st State kann in der ersten Partie das Gehirn verknoten, wird aber mit jeder weiteren Partie intiutiver. Für mich macht 51st State mit 2 Spieler die beste Figur.

51st State is a great game of efficient engine building. You are attempting to build locations, make deals, and raze locations to get resources which can then be turned into victory points of precious contract tokens which allow you to build more locations, make more deals or raze more locations! There are some amazing combos to be made, and player interaction is nice and quick as each player takes a turn doing one action and so on until everybody passes.

It works well at all player counts and I cannot recommend it enough!

I'm really glad I took a chance on this game. 51st State: Master Set is almost the exact same game as Imperial Settlers, which I played and enjoyed, but after awhile the imbalance and runaway leader issues became glaringly apparent. This game feels like a much tighter system. It changes the formula in some subtle but effective ways, and I think it's for the better. The factions are less unique, and I don't like the idea of churning resources into travel markers so that you can play and utilize cards, but otherwise this game is the better design, by far. The one thing that may be a little jarring for fans of Imperial Settlers, however, is how conflict-oriented this game is. Attacking each other happens far more often, and while this can lead to a more spiteful experience, I think it makes for a better back-and-forth game. I definitely prefer this to Imperial Settlers, and except for the couple of minor complaints I mentioned, this is the definitive version of this system.

UPDATE: Still a fun game, but I've cooled on it a bit. I like the look and feel of Imperial Settlers better, but this game feels more balanced. At the same time, however, I feel like the ability to build and maintain a tableau in this game is really difficult to do. As a result, deals seem to be the way to go. I just wish there was a game that was halfway between 51st State and Imperial Settlers. Neither game quite strikes the perfect chord with me.

I'll come back to this after a couple of 2 player games.

Despite the fact that 51st State: Master Set is the 4th iteration of the original game's concept it amazes me how much has still been done wrong. These flaws in design don't outright ruin the game (which would force my rating so low that it might attract Ignacy's attention), but instead just reduces its score to a mediocre rating.

Let's start with the Player Boards and how their only differences are the rate at which resources can be transformed into game currency. This could be enough to provide differing flavor between the factions, but unfortunately each conversion can only be done once per turn, reducing what could be a faction's inherent ability to the equivalent of a faction's starting Location (ie. this is where we come from, instead of this is who we ARE). As such, choice of faction has very little impact on game play.

Next, let's examine the 51S:MS's resources. There are just too many resource types:

The Upgrade Tokens are completely unnecessary. The game's mechanic of spending a Brick to upgrade a Razed Location limited by the requirement that the new Location be of similar type to the Razed one was more than sufficient without the addition of a new chit to represent a universal Upgrade ability. This minor Upgrade requirement created a unique dynamic in how players looked at their cards, whereas having a universal Token reduced an enjoyable decision-making process to simply one of Upgrading the best card in their hands. Cards producing the Upgrade Token resource are no better than ones that produce Brick and should be removed from the Location Deck. Their removal eases rules explanations for new players.

The Shield/Police Tokens are useless. The main drive of play in 51S:MS is the collection of Victory Points. Every resource, except Shields can be converted in some way to VP. Shields only provide a minor change in an opponent's cost to Raze one of your Locations, but as a Razed Location can be replaced with a new Location more cheaply than the cost of the original and at a gain of 1 VP, the purchasing of a Location that Produces Shields is a waste of resources and no experienced player would ever do so. All cards that Produce Shields water down the Location deck. They should all be removed to speed game play and ease instructing.

Finally, let's look at the cards in general. The cards are divided into 3 decks: A deck of Blue Connection cards, a deck of Red Connection cards, and a deck of Location cards.

The Blue and Red Connection decks add a supplemental source of Blue and Red Contact tokens. It is my theory that these decks were added to the game to compensate for players inability to use their faction's resource exchange more than once per turn. Had this exchange been reusable both of these decks wouldn't be necessary and could be removed from game play entirely; again, easing instruction.

51S:MS has 3 different Location decks: The base game and 2 expansion decks. Portal Games have specified that either of the expansion decks can be added to the base deck, but not both at the same time. They claim that each expansion has been balanced for a specific feel/theme and the addition of both destroys that balance. This is untrue. As has been described above, this game is far from streamlined and the reality is that adding both expansions just waters down the Location deck causing the game to become interminably long.

There are just too many useless or redundant Location cards. Beyond the removal of any cards involving Upgrade or Shield Tokens, any Feature Locations that only provide Building Bonuses of resources or VP, and any card with text that starts with 'If', can be safely removed from the game. This rebalances the Location decks to the degree that both expansions can be added to the base deck without the game slowing down.

51S:MS in its present form is a flabby, overcomplicated mess. The revisions I have outlined above will tighten the game up, improving play and enjoyment, but it shouldn't require this kind of house-ruling. 

A final note on components. One of the Preorder bonuses was new scoring pucks. The old scoring chits had '+50' on their backsides, a feature absent in the bonus pucks. With a little component surgery the '+50' can be grafted onto the new pucks. It would have been nice if Portal had included stickers for the pucks that could have saved owners this effort.

May upgrade the rating later, but for now I'm not super impressed.The drafting part does not involve enough cards to let you both take cards you want and deny others what they may want, so it becomes a very quick "I need resource X and this gives me resource X, so I'm taking this". Building is mostly a solitaire thing, since shields are expensive and being raided may actually be good for you if you drafted good, but expensive cards, so you don't overly worry about what others are doing. Factions may be balanced for expert players, but they did not feel especially so in our game. Especially in a 2P setting, I imagine having an advantage in raiding and facing someone with an advantage in making deals is a very tough time.

Still, beautiful art and theme, and it does satisfy as an engine builder. Probably works better in 2p.

It's 85% Imperial Settlers, with the only difference that the Faction decks are replaced by Connection tokens. It seems also harder to get workers, but it makes that playing time is more under control in comparison with Imperial Settlers.

The one thing I'm said they scrapped in this new version is the leaders and the fact that you can use an action building only 3 times, which forced you to invest in something new instead of just running your engine after a while.

But this version is certainly more streamlined and the rules are much clearer.

Great game! I like it as much as Imperial Settlers, but for different reasons. I like that it is a race to 25 VPs instead of 5 rounds. I also like the tightness and requirement to really manage your goods to get what you need. Ultimately, it is very similar to Imperial Settlers, but different enough in theme and mechanics to warrant me owning them both and alternating plays to keep from getting burned out on either. I absolutely love Imperial Settlers except for the art, so this gives me a break from that. One note, for me I like games that are bountiful in resources, and you feel like you are getting a lot done. This game will initially feel like the resources are so tight, and you can get hardly anything done. This make since thematically, and it is certainly tighter than Imperial Settlers, but if you play it enough you will become more proficient.

An improvement in every way from the previous edition. Some of the best strategy/engine building/combos I've seen in a card game. It might not be as clean or whimsical as Imperial Settlers, but I feel they've finally perfected their system with this one.

RATING: 7
Engaging tableau-builder that rises above the genre's mulitiplayer solitaire conventions. You really need to watch what opponent are doing, while razing- and the threat of razing - give it a ruthless edge that's appropriate to the theme. Attractive components with some of the most user-friendly iconography I've come across. Seeing some big spreads in VP in early games, so there may be some dramatic swinginess from early card-draws . We'll see if that's mitigated with experience.

My friends are really enjoying this so far.  Everyone has wanted to play it again.

Pros:
- Pretty easy to learn
- Solo Mode that is enjoyable
- Theme is cool
- Quality components
- Fast setup and pack-up
- Lots of meaningful choices to make and the order that I do things really matters
- Lots of ways to do well in the game
- Somewhat easy to travel with.  Components and base deck all fit in a small bag.  The boards are narrow so they are pretty easy to include next to something flat like a laptop or binder.

Cons:
- Can be very random with the luck of the draw such that, if it is really bad, can effect your score.
- [-]Really weird resource conversion that seems somewhat unnecessary and requires extra steps to accomplish.[/-]  After a few plays I see that this is to add a challenge?  The amount of resources a faction can get is not the same as how much that faction can put to use.  I think this is why those resources need to be converted to action tokens first.
- [-]Solo rules in the included rulebook are [b]really[/b] easy.  Isn't challenging at all and seems somewhat broken.[/-]  The difficulty appears to change depending on which faction I start with. Still need to test a few more times to be sure.  I use the BGG-user recommended mods to the rules where necessary.  Also downloaded the additional solo rules from the website.

The cards are not as diverse, and there are not as diverse strategies as I would really like, but it has a few significant advantages over Imperial Settlers. 

1) It plays faster. IS plays out in 5 rounds, and many actions and production buildings are so efficient that you can just keep going and going to the point that I start to lose interest. 51st State should play out in 3-4 rounds, and each round is shorter than a round in IS except maybe the first one. The intermediate resources limit your ability to keep chaining through more and more cards to some extent, and overall the length is more what I was looking for in this type of game.

2) It is much more accessible. In IS, you not only need to learn to play the game, you need to learn to play your faction, how to play against the other factions, and early mistakes or misfortune will effectively put you out of the game. It's more likely you'll manage to come back from a lackluster start in 51st State Master Set, plus it's easier to teach.

3) It's much easier to get my brother to play this on a regular basis due to a combination of 1 and 2.

Overall I think Imperial Settlers is the more interesting game due to the greater card diversity, but the things that bother me about it aren't a problem for me in 51st State.

The solo game is designed very similarly to the solo mode in Imperial Settlers, but it fails for entirely different reasons. In Imperial Settlers, the only reason to play the solo game is to learn the factions, which don't exist in a meaningful way in 51st State. The big reasons that the solo mode in Imperial Settlers fails once you've learned the factions is that the way the dummy player attacks warps the optimal strategy so that you rely as little as possible on common locations in a way that does not reflect the multiplayer game, and a big chunk of the action locations do nothing or are otherwise useless against the dummy player. In both solo modes, beating the dummy player is trivial, but in Imperial Settlers it makes sense to have scoring targets (however little ambition was put into the targets in the rule book) to demonstrate your facility with a particular faction since the game is always played over 5 rounds. 51st State is a race game though, so the targets provided at the end of the game don't make any sense. It makes more sense to try to trigger the end of the game at the end of round 3 than delay the game in hopes of getting a higher overall score. The attack that the dummy player executes is much more in keeping with the multiplayer game though, and works just fine.

Being this the original and 'Imperial Settlers' the implemented one, there are things on both games that I like a lot, but, if I have to choose, I'll go for 'Imperial...' for its variety of cards (I don't quite like that in '51st...' everyone takes cards from the same deck) and for those few twitches that separates it from its predecessor.

Outstanding streamlining of the original rule set.  All of the confusing iconography is gone.  The rules still could have used a bit more attention, but other tan that, it plays smooth as butter.  Still wouldn't want to play it with 4 - just like Imperial Settlers.  You have to balance building an engine as well as the time to turn it over from churning out stuff to turning that stuff into points.  It's a solid 9 for me.

Bumping this from 8 to 8.5 after a few more plays.

Really enjoy this game.  An excellent tableau-engine builder.  Wonderful theme, great components, clean rule set.  Once you understand all the actions, you'll get your opening hand and be pleasantly paralyzed by all the options.  Most surprising thing:  ends quickly - like sometimes after 3 rounds!  Be prepared for some BIG turns, but it's not annoying watching your opponents pull off sick combos since actions are taken one at a time around the table.  I think it players best with 2-players, but man, is it a satisfying, intellectual game.  I love it - for now, I'm putting it into my top ten.

Wow. What can I say about this game. I come from a TCG background, so I love cardplay. This game is all that. Each card with 3 different uses, drafting, AND each person having their own faction conversion board? Yeah this game is made for me. Instantly a ten in my book, the decisions with the cards, along with other people's states makes my brain work in such a great way. LOVE it.

Some of the rules regarding replacing a building are strange.

Usually, each building is worth 1 point; Replacing a building gives an extra point and one might argue that this is just to keep track of how many buildings were built in total, which would make each building action worth the same.

But then, there are ruins, which are worth 0 points -- also okay so far, someone attacking you directly costs you 1 point. But _then_, replacing a ruin, which is much easier than replacing a building, does de facto give you 2 points, 1 for the replacement and 1 for the new building, meaning that the much easier action is worth twice as much as the harder one, and to me that makes no sense.

Also, in German the rulebook and the overview sheet directly contradict one another concerning whether bricks and replacement tiles are identical or not, especially for the purpose of replacing ruins.

I'll start by saying that this game is great; however, I already have everything for Imperial Settlers, and I do not believe 51st State is different enough to justify both in my collection. Yes, 51st State is a race, doesn't have faction-specific decks/strategies, and makes you convert your resources into contact tokens -- all real, and in some ways, substantial differences from Imperial Settlers. Still, once you wrap your mind around these differences, 51st State plays out more like a complex, rethemed variant of Imperial Settlers than its own, unique game experience. Maybe one day I'll return to 51st State after/if I play out IS, but until then, I never felt compelled to pull this off the shelf over IS.

Interakcja między graczami ogranicza się do rabowania lokacji a szkoda, bo można by pokusić się o jeszcze kilka możliwości dokopania przeciwnikowi. W grze mamy sporo możliwości „ruchu” (każdą kartę można zagrać na 3 sposoby) i kilka dróg do zwycięstwa. Dodatki urozmaicają rozgrywkę i podnoszą regrywalność. Polecam 8/10

I loved the first edition of the game but it was hard to explain it and took some time to play. I tried Imperial Settlers and saw improvements but still missed the Neuroshima world and simpler distinction between factions. 

Master Set was finally released and I enjoy every tiny bit of it. Cards are looking better with more space for art and layout is easily understandable. Rulebook gonbe through a huge improvement - game is now easy to explain and learn and game time was cutted to a more reasonable amount. By all means engine building game and I would love to see more of it.

Now this is how you fix a game.

The original 51st State had its fans but it was not a good game. New Era tried to fix it, but that game only addressed some of the problems while keeping the production values laughably low. But now we have the master set which seems to fix almost everything.

First of all the production value is much higher now. We've got nice wooden pieces, functional faction boards, an actual score track that's not printed on the back of the box, and the overall art and look of the game is better.

The rulebook actually succeeds at teaching you the game. This may be a first for Portal games. Most of the information is in the order you would expect and it's not hard to find things you need when using it as a reference. The rulebook is written in a jokey style that could have been annoying, but it worked for me.

The gameplay has been streamlined in the best of ways. It now all makes sense and works together in a way that you would expect. Two simple rounds of card drafting, have a production phase, take actions until everyone passes, then a cleanup phase. Easy.

It's nice to have the options to include a whole New Era deck or a whole Winter deck when I want more variety.

Seems like a solid game, and a definite improvement over the old 51st State and New Era. Will rate after more plays.

Update: A couple of plays in now, it's good. I was a little concerned about the "lose everything at the end of the round" gameplay because I typically like to just amass a bunch of stuff and then figure out what to do with it later. But in this game you have to really plan out your entire round and work to make it happen before an opponent messes with it. Solid game, and a much-needed improvement of the system as a whole.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3[/b]
The game is also fine with four, but with newer players the downtime could be a real problem. You need at least 3 players to make the raze action and open production more interesting.

[thing=192458][/thing] is a game in which players use cards in varied ways in order to build locations, raze places and make deals (not among themselves). The purpose is to achieve points, since the person with the most of them at the end will be the winner.

The main positive point in [thing=192458][/thing] is the three distinct ways players can use the cards: to build places (which can be for product, feature or action), to turn them into deals (generating a smaller, but safe and constant production), or to raze the place (gaining a one-shot of several resources). This allows for a wealth of options each turn, with many possibilities and choices. Few are the cards that are without use, even when considering the unique paths players are going for.

The interaction in the game comes in two forms: a friendly one, when a person uses an "open production" building of someone else, which earns the owner one worker, and gives the production of the card to the one activating. And one destructive, with direct attacks on locations of others - is basically the raze action, just not in a card in hand, but, instead, in a card in play. This affects the player attacked in two ways: the lost of whatever the building did and the loss of 1 point (active locations at the end of the game are worth 1 point each). Yet, the place razed turns into a fundation, making it easier to build another one on its place - and doing this is worth 1 point, which basically nullifies the second problem of receiving an attack. Of course, when considering direct attacks, there is the possibility of bashing a leader (and the points someone has is clearly evident), and of some kingmaking. Still, is valid to mention that attacks to other players are costly and can't be done often due to this - also, there are ways to protect further a place, by increasing its defence, and when a player passes and ends her turn, her buildings are immune to attacks. All of this makes the timming of using some locations, cards and actions pretty relevant, which is a big plus.

A play lasts until a player reaches 25 points, which triggers the final round - this can make the time of play be diversed, still, it will, normally, be around 45 to 60 minutes, or less, with 2 players. The pacing is fast, as the actions are simple, clear and quick to be done, without big combos that can lead to long turns.

Overall, [thing=192458][/thing] is a well knitted game: rich in decisions and in spite of having variable players powers (with the different factions), which can induce to the risk of conducting the play in order to take better advantage of the best aspects of a faction, [thing=192458][/thing] counts with several paths to victory, mixing strategy and, even more, tatical decisions. [thing=192458][/thing] is made to have a lively pace, with short downtime, in a struggle for expansion, rebuild and survival, with threats coming from everywhere (you aren't a saint in this future either, mind you). In the end, I enjoyed the flow, the choices and possibilities of [thing=192458][/thing]. I will definitely play again.

I haven't played the original 51st State release, so I don't know how this incarnation of the game compares to it. I have played Imperial Settlers however, which is in its own way a reboot of the original 51st State. This Master Set attempts to backload the Imperial Settlers changes to the system back into a reboot of 51st State. Confusing? A little...but what you need to know, is that this is a very good game. 

I think I like it even better than Imperial Settlers, because it is a whole lot meaner. It's tough to really effect your opponent in IS and while it is not necessarily easy in 51st State, when you can land a blow, it really stings. I also like the narrative the game weaves. Imperial Settlers is kind of anachronistic and solitaireish, whereas 51st state is a Mad Max movie come to life.

You'll find yourself looting, pillaging and occasionally building a trading settlement as your tableau grows larger. It's still a matter of setting up an engine and then cranking it for points, but somehow the apocalyptic narrative just feels better than those generic civilizations in Imperial Settlers. I'm not sure if there is room for both games in a collection, so if I had to pick one, it definitely be this one.

Post apocalyptic sci-fi economic city building card game. Draft cards to add to your personal variable power city boards. Multi-use cards are Played to raze them for one time resources, deal them to add to your city benefit, or build to your city tableau for additional skills. Has some similarities to Imperial Settlers with more random plays as a result of the central card draft as opposed to pre determined start decks.

Way too much resource conversion in this one to my liking. Especially later most of your actions are just switching a resource to another one which makes the game way too long for what it is. The factions seem unbalanced too (?).

The more I play it though, the more I seem to like it.

Updated: I do indeed love it :D

This game is excellent. I'm leery to say it's better than Seasons, but it's damn close. The gameplay is fast and combo-rific.

It's great with all player counts.

Now this is a hard one to rate. I adore the original 51st State, combined with The New Era, and Winter (along with all the promos). The Master Set is definitely a streamlined version of the older game, and with greatly improved graphic design. Still, there are a lot of things I miss about the original.

They have made the Master Set even easier to get going in than the die in the original Winter expansion, but I'm not yet ready to rate the Master Set above the original series. I think I may keep playing both: the Master Set as a lighter, more streamlined race game, which can be introduced even to more casual players, while the original set will be reserved for hardcore gamer sessions.

There are a few improvements in the Master Set which I will introduce to the original series, such as the new Lookout Rules.

Played once with 2 players. I didn't like it. Very similar to Imperial settlers. Its very solitaire unless you purposely raze your rival buildings all the time.  The theme of the game didn't do much of anything for me.   If you've played Imperial Settlers then you've played this and I don't even know if this is better, worse.  As far as I can tell its the same game with a different theme.  I don't mind the game, I just find it "take it or leave it" affair and I probably won't be playing it again.

The goal here is to get to at least 25 points. That doesn't sound like much but you start off slow and it's a matter of building a finely-tuned engine that is the heart, and fun, of this game. By the end of the game you're pulling off high-scoring rounds which are just so satisfying.

For a game that's set in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland and full of great art, this game has very little theme. It's almost entirely pasted on and has minimal relevance to the gameplay. The artwork does the job of setting the scene at least.

The gameplay is very good, lots of interesting decisions to be made, it's quite taxing on the brain. Seems to have plenty of repeatability and satisfaction. We found ourselves discussing each match after it happened which bodes well.

It's somewhat AP prone but you're taking it in turns to do quite small actions so it's manageable. It's rather solitaire but does provide just enough interaction, barely.

All in all its not quite the game I hoped. The theme is lacking and it almost feels like I'm playing a game on my own but I find it an engaging puzzle that really satisfies.

Reduced to a 7 because of balance issues. Only 4 states to choose from and they're very unbalanced makes for little longevity.

An awesome, hard-hitting game made even better in this edition. Clear rules and cards, streamlined turns, and a cohesion that was missing from 51st State / New Era before.

There's actually a fairly subtle game in here, and quite a good one at that.  More subtle alas than many will ever recognise and thus the game fails.

Pretendida deducción y faroleo con mucho azar, y quizá demasiado corto como para que no se vuelva repetitivo muy pronto, ya que siempre se tiende a buscar los mismos engaños.

RATING: 6
Bluffing done right. Quick and addictive. Tend to prefer a set-up with all pieces lined up along one edge, and the target ring in the middle of the opposite edge, as this allows more jumping. Homemade.

RATING: 6
Very smart game.  But it's based almost purely on bluffing.  Adding to it very simple rules and quickness, there is a danger that it might wear out pretty quickly.

Fun nonetheless.

RATING: 8
Great little under-rated two-person filler of the "guess what I'm guessing but I know you know"genre. Really a mind-f&^%.  Don't agree with reviewers who say it's "all bluff". Skills involve a subtle and nuanced combination of movement strategy, like an abstract, together with bluffing and deduction--kind of a "Clans-Express" or "En-Garde express". I think gambling for $ would raise the excitement even more.  I play with a [thread=348870]"house rule"[/thread] that makes the game just a tad more meaty. Ghost is supposed to be a refined version of this; haven't tried yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice components.  An exceptionally simple game, I think it takes a little work to make it shine.  It seems like it would play best between two players who know each other (and each other's play style) quite well.  The mechanism is so simple that bluffing skills really come to the forefront.  When not in the mood, I can see how this can be annoying, but at the right time, such a short, unique game is a joy to play.

One of those bluffing games that's so pared down that it starts to feel like rock-paper-scissors. Didn't feel that the draughts-jumping was getting a much of look-in, with the "can't move away from the ring" rule, but maybe the game improves if you focus on that.

2-player bluffing game. Very simple but it is basically a mind game with a small board and some nice bits. Not bad, but not for everyone.

RATING: 7
This is a fun little bluffing abstract and as long as the gameplay is not taken too seriously (how could any game where you need to say 'Xe Queo!' be taken seriously) you can have a good 30-45min of fun.

STUPID, STUPID, STUPID GAME! One of the few abstract strategy games that makes me laugh HARD! Incredibly nasty, as what you expect from bluffing games. Incredibly quick, *unlike* many bluffing games!

RATING: 6.8
Very simple rules set that create some very complex -- but VERY subtle -- strategies.  At first it felt a lot like Rock-Scissors-Paper in the game mechanics, but then I began to see the underlying GAME and it began to feel more like Stratego, even a little like Poker.  Way more depth here than appears at first glance.  Its biggest flaw in my opinion is that it's over so quickly - best 4 out of 7 can end in 1 minute.  The quoted "20 minutes" is a maximum, I'd say.  To correct the problem, I'd play to 25 points, not 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The board game version of rock-paper-scissors.  Good bluffing, 2nd/3rd/4th/... guessing, and feinting, but not really much of an abstract beyond that.  I understand why the rules say you play best out of 7, and that still probably fits in well under the 20 minute time, even if it goes the distance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good abstract game here with a nice bluffing element.  That being said, it just didn't grab me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A totally charming game of almost pure bluff. It's got the minimum of mechanism to hang your hat on, so it's not pure rock paper scissors. But it's mostly looking into the soul of your opponent, and asking yourself if she has the balls to do again that stupid stunt she pulled on you last turn.

Played: a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after one play.  There was some concern that many of the decisions come down to guesses, but it's such a quick little game that it doesn't overstay its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice elegant idea, but I felt lost in the bluffing element, like it was totally random; perhaps I'm just not good at this sort of game? Got my butt kicked twice. Short and simple, so I'd try it again, but right now I feel a bit frustrated by the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun small box bluffing / doublethink game that has restored my faith in Alex Randolph somewhat. I love that the prize is literally a brass ring. It's much lighter than I thought it would be, and a round is typically over in just three moves.

A beautifully simple game, which rewards second-guessing your opponent. A great game of bluff and counter bluff. And, a typical game is around 15 minutes.

Being unable to secure a copy of this out of print game, I made my own version.

RATING: 7
Essentially a guessing game with a little extra added with the movement, but a fun, quick one nonetheless. My rating bumped up a point after playing again.  It's not just outguessing your opponent, but also a battle of nerves and sizing up just how much of a gambler your opponent is.  Pretty impressive for such a fast-playing game in a little box.

For some reason this one really clicks with me. I don't know if all the bluffing and guessing is real or in my head, but I get a real kick out of this game.
A great classic by master Randolph.

Cute little hidden-identity game, stripped down to its bare essentials. You win if you can, through moving the seven pieces on the board, move your own secret colour into the target ring, but you lose if your opponent succeeds first, or if they can identify your colour. 

Amazingly simple game, best played fast and intuitively.

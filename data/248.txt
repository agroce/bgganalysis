Have played this twice now, and I really do think it's one of the better long games I've played.  The structure of the alliances are excellent, in that they are binding until certain circumstances occur.  Writing up contracts is also a great way to be creative.  

It's a lengthy game and requires a fair amount of commitment from the players, but I love the concept and its execution.

This game, although a bit complex at first, is awesome.  I have had a lot of fun with this one.  It does take a long time to play however.  The alliances and marriages sealed with trade contracts really make the game suspensful.

Gameplay is a little inelegant, but the theme - the great kingdoms of Europe fighting wars and simultaneously interbreeding their royal lines - is an all time winner for me.

RATING: N/A
Excellent "game of thrones" dynasty game.  One major flaw.  The negotiations / contracts of marraige are too open ended (i.e. The players make them up). Ends up in more arguments between the meaning of the contracts than actual game playing.  If ever rereleased, would really benefit from the inclusion of a set of "contract" cards which limit the scope and interpretation of the deals made in the game.

Also too easy to get wiped out early in the game by poor childbirth survival rolls...

We tried it twice.  The basic concept is good, but the battle mechanics are dated and the rulebook is vague.  The contracts in Blood Royale just make a big mess of things.  The more I play negotiation games, the more I feel that non-binding agreements are the way to go.

Unique and fun - not as wargamy as one might think at first and I like that. I really get into the dynastic part of it. Eventhough it is fictional history, European history fans and royalty buffs will be the most likely to enjoy this neat game. We use a few home rules to speed up/streamline the game... I'd share them here on BGG - but GW doesn't want fans of their games to do that openly.

A medieval-themed simple area-control wargame with the possiblity of "rolling up" your princes and princesses and then marrying them off to prospective partners (having argreed and even signed specific deals qnd treaties). 

Gameplay is simple, but make one mistake, eg let your enemy occupy one of your main production areas, and you are finished.

RATING: 6
Very unique simulation of European royalty.  HUGE time commitment required.  Crux of the game is marriage contracts, which can take a while for inexperienced players to hammer out, because it's hard to know what kind of deal to ask for.  So, they end up engaging in more combat than is advisable, and some other chump who just sits back making the occasional trade cleans up and wins.  Nevertheless, combat can be satisfying ...

This is a child from the glory days of Game Workshop, before they turned into a Warhammer 40K factory. I bought this back in 1987 at the Gamekeeper in Providence, RI. I was up there with my friend Duane and I was flip flopping between buying it or not. I am damn glad that I did! We got many, many hours of fun out of it.

This game takes a while to play, but it has war, diplomacy, trade, and dynasties rising and falling. All with a roleplaying atmosphere. I have not played this game in 20 years, but I need to get it to the table again sometime soon.

Some of the idiotic names we came up with for dynasties are amusing to look at 20 years later.

In almost 15 years I have gone without this game in my collection in just the last couple weeks I managed to pick up a brand new copy, It's never played, It's in my collection where it will remain for all time. This game is the best game I have ever played. I paid 100 brittish pounds to own this game. I am currently making a deal with two people in London to buy up all of the available copies they can find to bring to the states to sell. The only two games that comes close to this game in any way shape or form would be Down with the King and Warrior Knights, Warrior Knights is also made by Games Work Shop and Down with the King is by Avalon Hill. All three games are now out of Print. You want a game to talk about for years to come, Own BLOOD ROYALE. Don't have a copy ill find you a good copy, It may take a little bit but I promise it will be close to mint condition.

good game, but needs more provinces, countries and players to be really good, but of course you would need a week to play it then. already you'd want to set aside a weekend for a truly satisfying game. the dynasties make it very interesting, but very long and you need more families (players) to really heighten the flavour and alliances. its possible with just 5 players for someone to marry their grandmother/father, which cant be a good thing (except a greek tragedy of course)

What a game from the past! Played this summer (2008) with wife, a couple of friends and plenty of time, most of us had a blast. The game is absolutely fun. Rules could be intimidating at first, but definitely easy to grab after a couple of turns. Bookkeeping wasn't an issue for us  - others could find it a nuisance. Rather, we laughed alot giving nicknames to characters based on their statistics, as "the Handsome", "the Foul" and so on and then trying to get the best negotiating marriages especially for those losers. Sometimes we went further, telling stories about our most loved characters and how they did get their nicknames. It's only real drawback is its playing time: we played during our vacation, dedicating a couple of rainy days with many interruptions for other activities. Can't wait to play it again!

RATING: 4
Unfortunately, this game suffers a lot from it's length. I originally bought it when it first came out, I maybe played it once or twice, then shelved it. For the time investment you need, it just doesn't give me that much enjoyment. And I really got sick of rolling up characters.  If someone invented a small character rolling software utility, so that you could use a laptop with the game, perhaps it might be playable. But, in truth, it really didn't get me. The rules were a pain the read and comprehend, and reminded me way too much of Kingmaker, and hence I was put off by it.

RATING: 9
This is one of the games that I really really like but I can hardly ever play.  You really need the right group of players to play the game, willing to put in the time to play some fairly long games, but also willing to not only be willing to deal with the fiddly notation required, but also get into the spirit of the character creation.  It has some RPG elements to it, but laid out on a strategic layer.  

You roll up nobility characters that form a family and then these go out to lead armies or get married off to other players families.  The complex web of relations that can form after several hours of play is fascinating and so in a sense the game is more akin to an RPG, where a lot of the fun is in the drama that unfolds rather than the strategic play at work. 

Because of this RPG aspect it is one of those games where if played with the right group you should be able to have great stories to tell about what happened in the game, and so the memories of it are almost as important as the game itself.

Still, it is incredibly fiddly and procedural.  I went ahead and tried to streamline the character creation process by making a huge deck of cards that represent every possible bonus set you can have.  It flattens the bell curve of the dice but, eh, it speeds things up tremendously.  

I'd want to rate this a 10 if I could play it all the time, or even seasonally, but because of it's quirky nature it's hard to get people willing to deal with the game elements and length of time.

Despite the draw of making characters, if you were tweak the game with pregenerated characters then you'd still have a solid game that could make for some fascinating interaction of family trees over several hours.

This is a strange one. I went into every game expecting a disappointment and every time I had exceptional fun playing. There's just so much theme, so much stories going on, so much negociation and laughs. The mechanics are a bit rough on the edges, it seems like it's not quite finished as a game somehow. That's always the feeling the game leaves me with anyways. But you get to name your nobles, make them have kids and marry the girls off to other players and it's just so much fun. It certainly is very long, however. I never got to finish a game, and I don't really expect I ever will. But in that case, it doesn't bother me.

I love this game more than it has any right to be loved.

The lineage theme is great fun. Some of the warped families we've created! A game that creates lasting memories with players that know how to have fun with a character. I just wish the game had a less arbitrary ending and a more compact playing time. The game is a little difficult to grasp on a first play. It's very different from the norm. You have to be comfortable in a game in which ANYTHING can be negotiated. Beware a poorly worded marriage contract!! Unlike other negotiation games like Diplomacy and Game of Thrones where negotiations are non-binding, agreements are bound to the letter of the contract until the marriage is dissolved.

Even back in the early 90's as a student the game was too long for us to finish it. Nowadays, the opportunities for long games with many players are so rare and so many other better or more popular games are competing for these slots that this wasn't likely to see any more play for the rest of my life. As far as I can remember it was a decent game and it was the first game I played that had free form contracts. Honestly, we didn't know what to do with this feature.

I picked up this gem at an auction back in the '80s and have always enjoyed it immensely. With all the delayed play due to constant negotiations, try to devote more than a single session to a game in order to really advance far into the turns. France is tough to play being right in the middle of things, but extremely gratifying if one can pull off a victory.

2 / 5 - Fair

Some really interesting concepts and unique mechanics in this boardgame-cum-RPG but it almost inevitably the game eventually gets taken over by tedious dynasty management and ceases to become much fun. This is absolutely *begging* to have a modern redesign from FFG or Black Industries - the result could be amazing.

Out of this world game, many complain it last to long but heck 3 hours? nothing to hard core gamers.. heck I would then suggest to those to do this game on a bad weather day then but even on a good day this is fun. I give it a 9 because you do need at least two games under your belt to be a pro at this and after that you find the games are shorter then your first try at it.

I find the theme and game play worth the time it takes to play this game (4-6 hours), but most people I know don't. If this played in half the time it would get a higher rating. The game has trading, negotiating, written agreements, and the tracking of the royal family tree with marriages tied to treaties is a very interesting mechanic.

Great game of negotiation with a little hack-n-slash thrown 
in.  I really like the variable abilities of the offspring.  How many play without event cards?  Wish I could combine this and Carver's other game, Warrior Knights.

Wish it had more spaces to fight over, more rules to flesh it out.  Gains only last a short while, and you really need the full complement of players to work best.  The family structure is great, and the ratings pf the children is brilliant.  The aging mechanisms are also great.  But an early death can be drippling for some time.

the two parts don't go very well together
There is a standard war game, and the very unusual and fun dynastic game. I really like the latter, but it takes to long for the children to grow up.

(10+ plays)

Who can play?  Strategy gamers.  3-5 players.

This game is just a few mis-steps away from being one of the greatest.  You play one of the 5 major European kingdoms over a couple of centuries.  It's a strategy game that has you controlling territories in Europe with soldiers to control resources, which make money, so you can buy more soldiers, take more territory, and so on.  The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.  The clever part of the game is that you have a king, queen, princes, and princesses as your royal family.  You give birth to princes and princesses and marry the women off to the other players.  This is where the negotiation comes in, as you agree to pay dowries or make alliances within the marriage contracts.  Every few years, somebody dies and throne succession determines the new king or queen - which has bigger picture strategy implications.  A very long but very interesting game.

On the downside, France is usually screwed, so it's better with 4 players.  Also, the combat system is irritating and renders a lot of the strategy and negotiation rather pointless.

Best part of the game: The creative deals you could make when you ally with another player via marriage. Unfortunately, you start to do this *an hour* into the game. I wouldn't have minded this, but the wargame itself (in terms of movement, combat, and resource management) is bland and repetitive.

Played once at a Con. It's really a game of negotiation, not a fighting game. I liked it, but one of the players just wanted to fight wars, which kind of undermined the diplomatic aspect of the game. It seems that you really need the right group of people to play this.

So much potential wasted.  The focus on lineage and how it affects the geopolitical world is fascinating.  I have never seen any other game approach this concept in a way that satisfies me.  But I keep looking.

[b]I USED TO LOVE THIS...[/b]

Then, one terrible day, we broke the game.
How?
Simple.
It was a 5 or 6player session, I think. And everyone just starting making obscene amounts of characters through breeding! Sheets of paper filled the house; so many different pacts and treaties were signed with these offspring, that I lost track of what was going off.
The game was a disaster. Boring.
Way too much paperwork.
Admin. Leave it at the office.
I haven't played this game since.

I was loathe to sell this game because it took me days of hard toil (a summer job in a supermarket) to earn enough to afford it. I can still clearly remember the bus ride to the shop, and the exact moment I swept the game off the shelf and took it to the counter. My first major games purchase. Sniff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable game, mainly due to forming marriages and then pumping out the sprogs in the hope that the wife dies in childbirth so you can rip the treaty up.
Tended to take so long to play that you never finished a game, just decided to call it quits at X year and see who had the most cash.

Too long, too complicated and way too much bookkeeping.  Blood Royale is the perfect example of how a thematic game doesn't always make an interesting one.

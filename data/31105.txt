RATING: 6
Fun, push-your-luck game with lots of little strategies.

Downgraded due to annoying sandstorm rules
Upgraded after realising we had been playing the sandstorm rules wrong.

Update: downgraded after realising that the more I play it the less I like it

Perfect filler for 2,3, or 4. Good amount of luck. But it feels like your decisions are important, nevertheless. This is a great end-of-the-night game when people are ready to go home. This comes with me almost every time I go somewhere with the possibility of playing a game(in laws, etc) Amazing little game!

One of Phil Walker-Harding's earlier games before he became known for "Sushi Go!". I enjoy Archaeology but rarely get it to the table as sleeker sexier games with different themes tend to displace it from my game bag every week but I should get it to the table more as it is a good time. You play the game to collect sets of treasure and then sell it at the right time. The trick is if you wait too long you can lose your set of treasure to other players grave robber thieves  or events like sand storms but the more you collect the better price you will get. So push your luck combined with set collection and a ancient Egypt discovery channel Indiana jones vibe are what this game is about.

A fast and fun card game in which you, in the role of an archaeologist, discover and sell sets of ancient artifacts. Beware of thieves and sandstorms! 

A good lunch time selection.

Played as a 2 player game - fun, fast. Reminds me of Bohnanza with better artwork. 2015 UPDATE: Uh, started watching a video review and, well, the first card shown was Pot Shard. I almost stopped watching out of sheer boredom... And then the next card was Parchment Scrap... an abstract, quick card game with a pasted on boring theme. If this ever gets re-themed, I may consider getting it, but for now it's too dull sounding for me to ever want to open the game box.

I'm not sure what to think of this game. On the surface, it is a light card game that provides some interesting decisions. Something that distresses me about the game is the set up that is involved for such a short game. The game itself takes 20 minutes tops.

The set up has gotten easier as I've played it more, but still, I find myself trying to make sure that those Maps, Thieves, and Sandstorms are shuffled in really well before we begin.

This game is good, though. I enjoy playing it. There are some definite tactics involved as well as pressing your luck. Do you hold on to the cards in your hand in hopes of creating a bigger set or do you take the safe points, but ultimately cripple yourself for a few turns while you build up a hand to trade with again?

A simple set collection card game. Players are supposed to dig for treasures in the desert. This actually means they just draw a card from the deck and then trade cards with the market and/or score sets from their hand. Its easy to teach and play but I didnt find the game interesting enough.

Nice, light little filler.  Plays very quick (under 20 mins) and is easy to comprehend.  Extremely luck-driven, but good fun nonetheless.  Some clever strategies that need a bit more exploration.

A self-produced game by an Australian author.  Excellent artwork, clear instructions and iconography, wonderful quality and great value for money.  

Well worth the money for a fine little game.

Einfaches Kartenspiel rund um das Thema Schätze bergen und gewinnbringend verkaufen. Das Spiel ist schnell erklärt und schnell gespielt. Die Elemente Ausgraben, Schatzsuche, Tauschen auf dem Markt, Verkaufen ans Museum sowie der ausgleichende Sandsturm und der gemeine Dieb sind gut und kurzweilig umgesetzt. Auch von Spielemuffeln wurde gerne ein paar extra Durchgänge mitgespielt. Damit eignet es sich sicherlich als Einsteigerspiel. Und da die Kartenbox auch noch sehr kompakt ist kann man das Spiel einfach mitnehmen.

A lot of fun for a short compact card game - good one to take out to coffee shops etc - obviously heavily luck based on card draws, but still feels deeper than that with the pyramid to explore and market to trade in. Will probably tire of it, but I expect to get a lot of plays out of it before that stage. Very good game for 7 year old and even our 5 year old plays it reasonably competently.

RATING: 7
When you want the thematic fun of archaeology, but you don't have the time for Thebes, this is a great alternative.  I love how the sandstorm cards constantly keep players on their toes, wondering whether they should hold out for more of those unique artifacts or just sell/trade them right away before they disappear.  The ebb and flow of the game is nice, because when you feel like you're straining to accomplish anything, suddenly a load of cards will become available.

If I were to make a complaint about the game it might be the setup time.  It's not a huge deal, but it seems like a 30 minute game should setup in less than 30 seconds.  Anyways, it's still a great little game that has enough strategy and decisions to entertain gamers, while still holding onto enough luck and pure fun to entertain non-gamers.  I expect this one to be a game that we will be coming back to for years to come.

Thank You to my 2010 BGG Secret Santa!!

This game was a lot of fun the first 10 or so plays.  After that, it really lost it's shine for me.  My six year-old, however, loves this game, and requests it often.  I'm glad I have games she really enjoys, but now that I've played this 40+ times, I'd rather play almost anything else right now.  With the right amount of time passing before I play this, I'm sure I will enjoy it again.

I think this game would be better with 3 or 4 players.

As a two-player game it is a little too luck dependant, although still fun.

Update: 3+ players makes this game a lot of fun!  A quick, simple, yet intelligent filler.  I love the market aspect of the game, a very neat little way of modifying your hand.  I also like the Pyramid, and the way Maps have a dual use.  With 3 or 4 players my rating will be 7.5 or even an 8, with 2 players I think it suffers a little.

This is an excellent and very simple little filler game though - well worth checking out!

Decent set collection game. Sandstorms are really annoying, but provide an incentive to press your luck or sell early. I don't know how much replay value there is here, but it's quick and compact. Good to bring along on vacation.

UPDATE: This game does not age well. You have very few interesting decisions apart from when to cash out, so the game boils down to simply hoping you draw well. The thief cards are unnecessarily punishing in a 2-player game, especially if one player draws them disproportionately more than the other. If frequently discarding half your hand and having cards stolen from you, so you sit around doing nothing but drawing a card every turn sounds like fun to you, then I highly recommend this game.

Pretty much sheer and utter randomness I'm afraid - it's dressed up in a decent theme, with nicely illustrated cards and some rules which make it sound like there's more too it but that window dressing soon dissapears in the chaos of the sandstorms and an Ali Babbaesque queue of thieves.

This is a case where the BGG ratings guidance doesn't help much.  On the one hand, the first half of the 6 rating applies - "OK game, some fun or challenge at least ..." but, on the other hand, the 3 rating is probably more accurate "Likely won't play this again, but could be convinced".  As it's probably the former when played as a family game and the latter if considered as a gamers' game I've split the difference.

Fantastic "holidays with family" game that feels enough like Rummy to be easy to explain, but has some great extra twists.  This especially has a nice trading mechanism with the common market. Some people complain about the Sandstorms and Thieves as random, but it prevents stock-piling and compels players to be more involved throughout the game. I like it. Sometimes compared to Jaipur.

Rummy-ish set collection with a twist
[Game Surplus $6.75 Jul 2010]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent light set-collection game with some push your luck and take that, sets up and plays in 10 minutes. Wonderful random and chaotic feel, but still interesting and agonising decisions to be made. My husband beats me everytime, so a certain element of skill definitely there to balance the luck.

Update Dec 2016: Rating lowerered from 7 to 6. While we still enjoy this, it is very light and is rarely chosen. We prefer Port Royal, Jaipur and Battle Line for short quick card games. Am considering the new version which seems to be an improvement though.

Nice little set collecting game with plenty of decisions and now with the addition of the sandstorm a bit of tension added to the game. 160 Charli scored in one game, think that's the highest we've ever had. 71 Plays.

Received for Christmas from Tommy!  12/18/09

Played with Tommy, Wendell, and an engineer who was in the breakroom (Scott).

Game was easy to explain, easier to pick up and understand, and pretty fast to play.  I enjoyed it and don;t mind it hitting the lunchroom plays whenever.  There shouldn't be a lot of AP with this game, although you can get your brain into working out if it is worth trading with the Market or "selling" to the museum.  Will play again.  Rated a 7  (1/8/10)

Heather and I had played a rule incorrectly (a player gets another card after revealing a sand storm - which will even it out for us a little more).  Heather is really enjoying this game for it's speed to set up and speed to play.  We played 3 times in one sitting.  Could become a mainstay in our playing.  Raised to a 7.5 because of this (3/12/10)

RATING: 7.5
This game took me by storm. Yes, I’ve only rated it a 7.5, but for a filler that’s like a 9. It only takes 10-15 minutes to play, and it’s a great game! It plays 2-4 players, and I’ve only tried it with 2 and 3 as I haven’t had the possibility to try it with more yet, but I’m sure it is pretty good with higher player counts too. I can honestly say that it’s a great filler game with 2 or 3 players. Dare I say that it’s almost on par with the great couple’s game Jaipur…? At least to me, Archaeology has some of the same qualities as Jaipur in that it’s a genius, light game which plays extraordinarily well with 2 players. Archaeology even plays in about half the time as Jaipur, and you can play it with up to 4 players!

It’s such a simple game, but there’s something enjoyable about it. Sure, if you hate luck, you might have a problem with this game; it’s a card game with random card draws after all. Personally I despise luck in my games, but for a game which lasts 15 minutes it’s perfectly fine. If you constantly draw low cards you’re going to lose (like I demonstrated in two of my games in which I didn’t draw any 3 or 4 value cards), but you can always just get in a second game right after the first… 

What I like about the game is the short length and relative simplicity combined with an actually quite interesting gameplay; you draw a card and can then trade in your cards with the market or sell your cards to the museum. It’s a set collection game with some trading going on (not between the players but with the market). There’s some player interaction in the fact that the other players are able to get the cards you trade to the market, and furthermore the “thief” cards add some interaction because you steal cards from your opponents. The sandstorm cards also constantly add tension because you don’t want to collect too many cards before you sell them as you might lose half of them to a sandstorm… All in all I think it’s a great filler which can be enjoyed by both gamers as a casual filler between bigger games as well as non-gamers and wives (those who aren’t that much of a gamer but whom you want to introduce to the hobby!).

RATING: 9
As a playtester and the designer's cousin, I'm obviously going to be biased, but for my money this is a fantastic game. It's certainly at the lighter end of the spectrum, but I think you need to accept the game on it's own terms.

Same deal with the sandstorms and thieves - yes, they keep you from card-hoarding and throw a spanner in the works of your long-term strategising, but that's exactly what they're designed to do, so I have no qualms about their frequency.

Archaeology is never going to blow any hardcore board game geek's mind with it's scope and depth, but as a light filler or a Gamewright-calibre family game, I think it succeeds on every level.

I like the whole idea of digging for treasure, and I like the cards and artwork, but the game just seems like too much luck. Someone could easily have an advantage depending on the draw. Nonetheless, I could still be talked into for a few laughs, because it is not a very long game after all.

RATING: 7
Decent enough filler, but I guess at the end of the day this is just a filler.

My main problem with it though is that the higher value card don't multiple as much with more cards.  This is a game where generally keeping more low value cards are better because of theif/sandstorm, and generally people will sell their goods to the museum asap.  Having the 1 value item trading for 3 points/value makes the higher value item redundant.  I've never seen a game where people go for set of 3/4 value item because the game is too fluid to allow that.

RATING: 10
Very fun with ingenious and tense mechanics that force you to not be greedy - sand storm and thief. They are great elements that make the games memorable. I remember games where 3 thieves were left and the deck got smaller and smaller - and both of us were at the edge of our seat waiting for those thieves to come up. We knew we couldn't save our cards and had to cash them in for points quickly during this phase, because there were 3 thieves ready to pounce on us.

This is a built in mechanic. The thief and sandstorm cards tell you how many are in the deck - same goes for all of the other cards. This is an integral and cool part of the game. Removing it as a variant would make it a pointless exercise without tension or immediacy.

Great combination of set collecting, push your luck, and bluffing.  3 Player seems to be the ideal # for me.  2 & 4 is good too.

Fun to tease your opponent about a sandstorm coming too.  Swish the top cards around a bit and make blowing sounds.  Very thematic.

Light-hearted card game where it's all about gambling on timing.  Collect sets, but don't wait too long to bank them, or you could lose them to a thief or the dreaded sandstorm!  Also you must decide to play or hold treasure maps to unearth extra cards - hold them too long and you may never get the option.

Very easy to learn and fast to play.  A good filler for families.

Components: Easy-to-distinguish artifact symbols; and easy-to-read points charts. Quality cards.

Experience: Every turn presents opportunities to specialize in different types of artifacts, but my hand was constantly constrained by the luck of the draw. When I was lucky to draw high-value cards, I had lots of options; when I was unlucky to draw low-value cards, I had few options. As the game progressed, lots of juicy cards built up in the market, but noone could afford them. The sandstorm and thief add some pressure, but they just make it all the more unwise to ever try to get the more lucrative cards.

Simple set collection filler that appears to be like Bonanza without the trading. Still, there are small moments of push your luck in getting the right cards or trading in the right cards at a certain time. Standard card draw luck in this game. Out of print.

Card quality and art is average.

A lot of your strategy hinges around going for cheap sets to secure a decent amount of points or going for harder sets to get larger points. Often the set is only worth turning in when it is a the max, so the various levels don't feel as important as trade offs. Highly luck dependent when getting map cards or well used thief cards.

Overall:
Played this a number of times with both 2 and 4 players. With ages ranging from 10 - 40 and all have enjoyed it a great deal. Even by someone who "does not enjoy boardgames".

Would have LOVED an expansion to this game!

RATING: 7
Quite a good lighter game. For such simple mechanisms, models pretty well the results of an archealogical dig and trying to turn around some quick bucks vs going for the big find. The take-that events grate with me a bit, especially the thefts, but the damage is controllable and they fit the theme well. We always get a few laughs when playing this.

This game revives the trading mechanism from Bazaar. You exchange cards in your hand for like-valued cards from the table to create sets that score. Archaeology has a few additional wrinkles that make it preferable to Bazaar. I want to try the game without the thieves, as the sandstorms should be sufficient to prevent card hoarding.

My last draw in a 5p game was, "If I draw a one I lose, anything else I win". Unless there is a risk/reward push your luck element, which there isn't here, that is never a moment I like in a game. We could have cut for high card 30 minutes ago and been done with it.

The second version of Archaeology.  Players dig and trade artifacts, trying to build a more valuable set.  Things have been slightly tweaked from the original - you now draw a card at the beginning of your turn, but the rest seems the same.  The other big change is the Sandstorm cards, forcing you to discard half you hand (felt too chaotic).  I'm not sure they improved the game - you can't build a set as the Sandstorms will whip them away, forcing you into many cheap sets that you can cash in quickly.  Fast to play, so perhaps the luck factor is acceptable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Light set-collection card game to play with my wife or family, or to bring to game night to play if waiting for someone to show up. I strongly prefer as a 2p, but will play with 3p (avoid with 4p). The reason for this is that it's more gratifying (psychologically speaking) to meld full sets, which becomes harder to do with more players. I can appreciate how this would not a deal-breaker for some. Rating as a 2p is 8, deduct one point for each additional player added.

I've been playing this a lot lately with my wife. There are a number of objective criticisms one can make - the prevalence of sand storms, the problem with the thief being drawn by one player too often, the luck of the pyramid when one gets a couple of map draws. Taken individually, any of the above may be annoyingly random. Together they all tend to even out in what is an ultimately very fun and short card game.

Rating change from 7 (2011) to 6 (February 2016) to 5 (June 2016).

After playing the new version, I was reminded how annoyingly the thieves and sandstorms can be. The latter adds a nice press-your-luck element to the game, but the frequency makes it hard to feel like you're building to much. Otherwise, I like the main mechanics of the market and selling to the museum.

RATING: 7
Set collection with plenty of disasters mixed throughout the deck. Push your luck at its finest. Players will need to evaluate the risk in holding valuable cards in hand vs scoring them early for fewer points. With the release of The New Expedition, this game now has additional variability in the map cards, and support for up to 5 players, which is a welcome addition to an already fine game. Retiring this original copy from my collection - lowering this from a steady 8 to a 7 as the new version is definitely a 9.

Received in trade 5/26/11.  First plays, 2-player with my daughter 7/17/11.  We both really liked this game!! My daughter tried to hoard the cards waiting for the big number combinations.  That strategy failed.  We'll see if she modifies her strategy/tactics from now on.

RATING: 7
The market card trading is masterfully done, as is the timing mechanism and tension of the sandstorm. The thief adds a fun take that element, but does add more randomness to the game.

Aside from some basic strategy and card counting, the game can often feel slanted to the player with the luckier draw, but it is still a fun ride.

Doesn't really grab me. It's supposed to be push-your-luck but it lacks any tension to make the game have any excitement. It's a short game but it shouldn't mean the game design should be more slack.

Also, for a short game, the setup takes a bit of time and is basically to ensure the sandstorms and thieves are evenly distributed throughout the deck. And even then, it may not always work and you get three sandstorms in the row. Meh.

(As of [b]6[/b] plays) A straightforward set-collection rummy-type game in the vein of [GAMEID=11], but without direct player-to-player trading and with disasters that add a mild push-your-luck element. Great for hooking non-gamers, but limited strategic options make it repetitive in the long run.

2-4 players, good husband/wife game with two players, and children also love it.  Received as a gift from some good friends - thank you!

It is really a simple set-collection game, but the press your luck aspect caused by Thieves and Sandstorms combined with sets of increasing value works well.  Very popular with the children, and a good family card game that plays quickly.

Strategy: I wonder whether the points for the different treasures are correctly balanced.  It nearly always seems worth the risk to try to collect or trade for a full set to maximize your points.  But there seems little point in going for a full set of Talismans because you'll get more bang for your buck with full sets of most other treasures; and the Pharaoh's Mask is only worth going for if you get a complete set of 4, which is unlikely.  Broken Cups give best points reward with a full set, followed by Pot Shards and Coins, with Parchment Scraps being the worst slightly behind Talismans.  This seems to make going for complete sets of Broken Cups, along with Pot Shards and Coins the optimal strategy, although this will less of an issue if all players are aware of this and compete for them.

Super fun game of set collection.  There are many twists and turns to this game that always elicits laughter.  The deck is just so well balanced, particularly with the new rule to remove one sand storm for every player above 2.  It plays perfectly with 2, 3, or 4 -- although I think I like it best with 2.

Can be a bit of a runaway leader problem if you are lucky enough to find all the maps and continually boost your hand size by raiding the pyramid, but then you have more cards for the thief cards to target.

A three rating as written. The thieves and sand storms add too much chaos to the game, devaluing what is a solid set collection mechanism. Interest increases by reducing the number of thieves and sandstorms in the deck to two each. (Regardless of the number of players)

A great gateway card game, with the caveat indicated above.

RATING: 7
With two the luck issue is greater.  The first game my opponent drew all the map (and got the pyramid cards) & 5 thief cards for a total of 17 more cards than I had.  This won her the game.  With more people playing, The wider distribution of cards reduces the potential one-sided luck element which is pretty strong with 2 players. 

Have played with 4 and is a better game.

Very random set collection game. The underlying idea of set valuation isn't uninteresting but the execution means that the winner is determined by random distasters more than anything else.

Fun little set collection card game where the bigger the set you build up in hand the more it is worth, but once you put it down on the table you can't build it up anymore... and various things could lose you the cards you were planning to use in that set.  Also there is trading of cards in your hand against a market of cards in the middle of the table.  Different sets have different frequency distributions, and the points for items-in-set climb at different rates.

Super awesome Caity & Brian Christmas Gift 2012!!

Archaeology is a very enjoyable filler that uses the push-your-luck mechanic fairly successfully.  I like that the price paid for increasing sets is very incremental, but jumps quite a bit at the highest set amount. It makes holding off for large sets very rewarding and very risky! This is a filler, first and foremost. Easy rules, easy play. But players will agonize for their moment on what to do, not really out of any sense of strategy but really out of whether they can risk holding out for one more round. Again, this game takes the best of one mechanic and isolates it for your enjoyment. Wouldn't pull it out any other time than as a filler or for younger gamers, but it's smart enough for everybody. One of the more decent card game fillers.

In my first play I got totally screwed by a series of sandstorms and thieves, and lost by approximately as many points as I'd lost in that sequence. That leads me to believe it's really quite random. I'd play this with kids, or at a party, but can't take it seriously.

I don't really see the tension OR the push your luck elements in this game. The options all seem to be fairly obvious during gameplay. Furthermore, I am afraid the math is off. It is typically more economical to go for the easier, lower priced sets. This seems odd. In fact, the most valuable set only requires 2 cards. Shouldn't there be some incentive to try and wait for larger, harder to collect sets?

That said, it is an enjoyable card game that does require decisions to be made about what cards you will keep and which ones you will drop for others. You can run accross situations where you must make tough choices; I just wish they would come more frequently.

Not a bad idea for a set collecting game, but even for a light filler there is too much luck of the draw. A lot of what you can do on your turn depends on the trade value of the single card you draw, varying from 1 to 4. The high number of thief and sandstorm cards makes any planning a gamble. And the uninspired artwork certainly doesn't add to the fun.

Need more plays, but looks fine for what it is. 

Not sure if I played it any smart, but drawing 1`s only really fucked me up, while my opponent drew bigger cards and thus, could use the market in a much better way than I could. That left a bad taste behind, but I will play it some more, before I decide what to do with it.

Thanks Secret Santa! Great little push your luck set collection game - everyone I've introduced it to likes it so far. I like the fact everything is out in the open - everyone knows how many cards do what, what has been used etc, meaning you can all make informed decisions without card counters getting an advantage. Good playing time too (around 20 mins) no matter how many players, as you simply work through the deck once. Only downside is slightly fiddly set up, but definitely worth it. I've brought it down from an 8, as other fillers have usurped it of late, although I still really enjoy it.

Quick and fun that does a surprisingly good job of evoking the feel of collecting archaeological treasures; I can't think of any other light card game that I've played that does an equal job of it.

It takes a game or two to get a feeling for how common sandstorms and thieves are: the game works against players hoarding cards in their hand for some grand master stroke move. I imagine that would cause quite a few people to dislike the game.

The treasures in the pyramid feel like the biggest source of random unfairness, though it generally doesn't bother me too much since the game plays quick enough that randomness should equal out across games (though not necessarily within a single game).

Its brevity means we usually play two or three games in a sitting.

After a couple of plays, I think the game has some promise, but needs some modification to be enjoyed by me and my friends.  The theives and sandstorms make it almost impossible to plan for anything other than the immediate moment and you don't get a feel of making any meaningful decisions.  This is ok for a game of this length, but I've played a card game that has a similiar set collection idea so this suffers in the comparison.

Archaeology makes for an interesting and appealing set collection card game. The market aspect really opens up your opportunity to employ a greater degree of strategy.

Very simple set collection game.  Easy to teach, bit of screw over value with thieves & sandstorms.  Not very deep, thus not a great amount of re-playability.  Luck of the draw can seem exceptionally unfair when gaining cards from the pyramid.

Jun09: One play in. Seems like a solidly okay game. The ratios bug me on some of the cards, but I have to balance in the need for hand buffers to forgive some of the lower market value issues.

As played, it still felt like a few too many Sandstorms. And it just didn't feel like that much hand management. I had certain market values and really couldn't add much to them other than drawing one card per turn.

The decisions were pretty much limited to:

When do I cash in and play my cards?
How do I sculpt my hand to weather my opponents' turns?

And the more I think about it. The less either of those really seem that pressing. Hrm. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's all in the tension of when do I play?

It does go fast and I like the open turn structure without gobs of phases.


Now, compared to other filler games? I don't think it makes the cut. No Thanks, Colorreto and Circus Flohcati all come to mind as better games in all likelihood.

Still, I'll give it another go or two. It does have a neat theme going for it.

Archaeology is extremely light - the results of the game are mostly dictated by luck of the draw as the players who happen to draw sets over time and pick up the map cards for quick extra cards tend to win. There is, however, a bit of a fun push-your-luck element in deciding whether to sell artifacts or hope that a sandstorm or thief doesn't take them away. It is also easy to teach and quick to play, making it a decent filler game (especially for new gamers).

I enjoy it - but that is mainly because I can see the big picture. My wife on the other hand can't really see the big picture and gets caught up collecting specific sets where I love trading and maximizing my returns.

We both like the trading, digging, and searching the pyramid. Fun game, however doesn't see much table time due to others in our small collection.

Archaeology is a fun, fast-paced card game with just enough depth and strategy to earn a regular spot as a light/filler option.

Archaeology: The Card Game is a great little set collecting game that plays in 15 or 20 minutes.  My only complaint would be that those sandstorms seem to hit me only when I have really expensive items in my hand, but that's more of a personal thing.  Otherwise, this one's really solid.  Just enough stuff going on strategy-wise to make it really stand out in my collection.

This is a set collecting game where you try to score points for selling sets of the same cards, getting points according to a scoring multiplier which differs by card type. There is a marketplace of face-up cards you can trade with on the table, as well as a pyramid with treasure rooms containing 3, 5, and 7 cards. You need to trade in 1, 2, or 3 map cards accordingly to claim those bounties. Each turn a player draws a card from the deck and then can do any or all of the other actions: go to the pyramid if you have the required map cards, trade with the marketplace (you can trade for cards of equal or lesser trade value), or sell sets. You can draw Thief cards that allow you to steal a blind card from your opponent and Sandstorm cards that make all players drop half of their hands into the marketplace. The game ends when the deck is exhausted and nobody has any cards left. Very light game. Plays in about 10-15 minutes. Not bad at all for what it is, but probably has a bit too much randomness for my tastes in general.

Wow - what a surprise! Picked up in a 'Small Things' math trade on a whim. Plays so naturally and quickly that it became an instant hit in our household. Add in the small profile for exceptional portability and you have a game that keeps finding itself tucked into carry-on luggage for trips, etc. Remarkably quick to teach (and conversely, learn), it deftly blends bluffing, set collecting, and a bit of screw your neighbour into a recognizable theme and results in a game that pleases just about everyone.

Nice set-collection filler with some Rumikub-esque choices in trading cards from your hand with a pool avaiable in the middle of the table.  While the Thief and Sandstorm cards keep players from hording too much in their hands, they also make the game even more random and, to me, less attractive.

Push your luck, set collection card game.
The game is fine, nothing wrong or bad about the game play at all. However it didn't do much for us at all. After the first playthrough we didn't want to play it again, and for the next few months we didn't even consider taking it to the table.

The only complain I can give the game, other than it not being fun enough, is the set-up time. It took too long for what it is, a quick card game. (set up time might not be an issue once you get more familiar with the game)
The theme didn't do much for us either, but that is more of an issue of preference I guess.

RATING: 8
With two players, I was not impressed and was thinking of trading the game away. After a three player game, I am more impressed as the game moves more quickly so does not overstay its welcome.

This would also be good for fans of Settlers of Catan. Archaeology has two cards that work similar to the power of the robber in Setters. The first card is the Thief, which allows you to steal a card from another play. The second card is the Sand Storm, which causes all players to discard half of their cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules are simple and actually evocative of the theme (I particularly like the hidden treasure piles in the pyramid).  It's an interesting spin on set collection, where you have a common pool shared between the players.  As a result, you have to be careful of what cards you trade there.  Even better, I was able to teach the game to my parents over the break and get them to play with us.  They had a lot of fun---my mom teased my dad over his analysis paralysis and my dad jumped in the air cheering when he sold several big sets to the museum and a sandstorm was drawn the very next turn, causing us to lose our cards.  

The game does feel a little chaotic with four players with a significantly smaller deck and more time between your turns.  For two players, the game feels a like it has little more in control, but it's still prone to wild swings of luck due to the thief and sandstorm cards.  This push your luck aspect works well in a social setting with more players, and it's okay with two players if you're just looking for a light game and not expecting more.  Compared to [thing=54043][/thing], another set collection game with a common pool of cards, [thing=31105][/thing] feels more thematic and fun to us, and it's a lot more portable while supporting more players.  Not all of the treasures are as balanced, but I don't think that's a problem as it just causes the players to fight for the more valuable ones.  I suspect this will join [thing=50][/thing] as one of our light, low-stress "airport games".

I don't understand the complaints about the thief and sandstorm cards; these simply add an element to the game that prevents card hoarding which can be a problem in other "rummy" type games.  This is a great card game that puts enough of a twist on the rummy formula to make it fresh.  There are some great decisions to be made, and almost all the games I've played have been close.  Best of all, It scales great from 2-4. After 20+ plays, I think I really like it best with 2 players.  Very quick and fun.

A set collection card game with a push your luck element.  There are sandstorm cards in the game where you can lose half your cards if you do not sell them to the museum.  There are also cards that you can acquire from the pyramid.  I like the game but the market does fill rather quickly.  It seems that as long as there are sandstorms I t may be best to play sets quickly.  

Very much a luck based game but it is a quick one that does not bother me.

1.4 - Nice simple game about collecting artefacts. Some issues with the implication that all arabs are thieves in the cards, so I suspect the redo (archaeology: the new expedition) will sort that out.

This we have played a lot over the last few years. You are set collecting archaeological relics, trying to avoid thieves and sandstorms whilst at the same time collecting maps so you can explore the chambers of the pyramid (and discover new cards into your hand) and deal with a central market.

It is the favourite game of my youngest daughter. She loves drawing the thief and stealing my map or expensive relic card. She loves games where you can get at someone else and you definitely can in this one. It is strange though when I draw the thief and go to chose a card blindly from her hand certain cards have a markedly increased resistence to me taking them, I can see the strain on her face as I try harder to pull the card from her grasp (bad dad I know)! This is the sign that "this is not the card you are looking for" and that I should move along and choose another. Strange how she wins nearly every game!


One extra point I will make as I have to do it everytime we play. The set up requires the shuffling in of the thieves and sandstorms after the pyramid and player cards have been dealt out. An extra step of shuffling which is nothing for most people but if you don't shuffle really well at this point it can spoil the game as those "bad cards" can come out all at once.

Good fun game but it does have a bit of take that with the thieves and the sandstorms, don't even start me off on the sandstorms, they mess everyone up!

Great little set collection game, with the tension kept high by the ever-present threat of losing cards to a sandstorm or a thief. Yes, there's a lot of luck involved but I like chancing my arm occasionally. Works well as a 2-player game.

RATING: 7.5
We take out two thief cards in the two-player game just to make it a little less attacky. I have the older edition. 

What makes this a good set-collection game is that you can't hold onto your cards until you have the perfect set. If you wait too long, you might lose them to a thief or a sand storm.

I can't think of a single flaw in this game. It is well thought out and features solid card quality. The game is also quite fun and playable in about a 1/2 hour. IMO, Archaeology is not quite as good a filler as Biblios or Balloon Cup, but it serves the same purpose. Great little game.

Update: Down from a 7 to a 6. Perhaps it doesn´t stand up to five plays in less than a month, but I think there are too many turns without interesting decisions even for such a short game. Also, the randomness sometimes levels out what decisions remain. I don´t mind playing but I won´t suggest it for some time.

The thieves add quite a lot of randomness and Take that!, while the sandstorms are in line with the risk management of collecting vs. selling. The pyramid is a nice touch. All in all, a decent game with short playing time.

RATING: 6
Wow.  My expectations for this game weren't just exceeded, they were blown away.

Frankly, my only expectation for Archaeology was "puts me over the free-shipping threshold on a large order."  When I played it, I found an astonishingly fun game.  This game packs a lot of truly agonizing decisions into a small, quick package.

I see people saying that the game has a lot of luck.  This is true, but that's what makes those decisions so deliciously agonizing.

Archaeology doesn't have the depth of Race for the Galaxy or Dominion, but in terms of play time and fun it falls into the same category.  It's superfast to set up (sorry Dominion!) and superfast to teach (sorry Race!).  And, to top it all off, my non-gamer fiancee enjoys it.

It won't replace Dominion, but I expect that this will see a lot of play time around here.  

After my first play, this is an 8.  I could see this going to a 10 or a 6, depending on how it holds up over repeated plays.

It's settled out at a 6 because I don't find myself bringing it out too often lately.  I find I prefer longer and meatier games rather than fillers.  But if you're looking for a filler, this is an awfully good one.

Game in a Nutshell: Collect sets of artifact cards, trade them with the market and sell them for points before they get stolen or swept away by sandstorms.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: The definition of a filler... very easy to understand, plays quick, has some interaction, and comes at a great price-point. I think the theme is nicely represented in the mechanics. Some complain of the chaos, but I like it (to a degree, see below) and think that drives a major part of the game's interest.

Cons: The odds are impossibly stacked against anyone who wants to press their luck and go for a full collection of one of the higher value sets. It makes the game one dimensional. (warning: potential buzz-kill spoiler ahead) It's simply about hoping you draw cards with high trade value, trading them for cheap cards you can complete sets of and selling. Don't do that, and you'll be targeted by thieves for holding high value cards, lose your ass to a sandstorm, or both. Once, everyone understands this, it simply boils down to who draws the best cards and can cash in on maps.

Other: I like what was done here on a lot of levels. It's very Bohnanza-ish but designed to play in a 3rd/4th the time. I think that part works, it's just unfortunate it wasn't balanced as well. Still it's a fine game to bring out on occasion, but the one-dimensionality gets stale quick if played repetitively.

Best Use: A cheap addition to your filler rotation.

 Baffled about the recommendations on this one. I have enjoyed other card games with mechanics in common with Archaeology. Here they create (for my group) an uninspired atmosphere plagued by frequent random *discard your hand* events- the hand you have spent x turns strategizing over. Perhaps more of a family and less of a gamers' game.

Being a huge fan of small card games, we highly anticipated this one. However we were very disappointed.

This game plays really fast as you mostly just pass & watch for opportunities - either in your hand or in the market.  Then you cash in on that opportunity with some cool trades.  When played this way, the game is fast and interesting: sometimes you get 4 turns within 10 seconds, then you take a reasonable amount of time on one turn to do a lot of transactions.  It's actually pretty unique & fun. (rating bumped from 5.5 to 6.5)
* * *
When I first played Archaeology, I didn't care for it.  There didn't seem to be any interesting decisions: the cards I had in hand seemed to dictate what I was able to do.  The sandstorms & thieves might add tension, but they seem to come up just too frequently.

Using a set collection mechanic similar to Bohnanza, this game is a neat little title as it goes on to throw a few extra tricks into the bargain. These include the ability to trade with the marketplace (think face-up cards in Ticket to Ride) and the inclusion of Thieves and Sandstorms allow for some nasty results.

Won Australian Game of the Year in 2008 and is well worth havng in the collection.

In this set collection card game, one is trying to collect sets of objects in ancient Egypt to sell to the market. However there are sandstorms that make you discard half your hand, thus making you to have a tough decision to sell quickly or risk holding on. There are also thieves, that allow opponents to steal one card from your hand. There are also map cards which allow you to get more cards. 

There is a ton of luck depending who gets robbed by the thieves and when the sandstorms hit. Once I got a good card and waiting one turn to trade to the market, I got it robbed. There are some neat concepts, and it is a quick game at 20 minutes.

I felt there was so much luck that I couldn't adequately plan, and there was no push-your-luck or other mechanic that was strong enough to keep me engaged. I think in our game we had several early sandstorms leaving us with little in our hand, so it devolved into drawing from the deck and hoping - almost never a good sign in games I feel.

RATING: 6
Set collection card game with an unbalanced luck of the draw. The winning strategy is to draw higher valued cards, which correspond to greater purchasing power. Compare this against a set collection card game like Money, wherein luck of the draw is balanced against a clever auction mechanic. In Archaeology, there are thieves and sandstorms that add a press your luck element to the game, but this mechanic operates independently of the central "draw a card, and hope it's worth 4" luck of the draw. On the plus side, it plays quickly.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later...[/COLOR]

[i]I got a copy of the reprint (Archaeology: The New Expedition) which has a few new cards and in my opinion is the far superior game. Check out my comments for the new version which I rate an 8.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I enjoyed my one play of this and would play it again if requested, but I would much rather play a host of other card games that involve set collection elements. 
I really hated the sandstorm and thief cards, they added way to much chaos and randomness to the game. There is no way to mitigate their effects. In the end you could play a great game and then a thief or sandstorm hits and completely ruins your plans.

If you are looking for an Egyptian themed card game that involves set collection and digging through treasure I would highly recommend [thing=114387][/thing] over this.[/i]

Played 3 games, 1 with 6 year old son and 2 with wife and son. Came in last both times in the 3 player games but I am still enamored by this game. Love how tactical each turn is and how agonizing it is to decide whether to sell cards now or risk getting sandstormed. Quite a bit of luck involved in the thief cards but it is these tense moments that define the game. Like how my wife picked a map card from my hand to be able to discard 2 map cards for the 5 card pile, thereby cementing her victory. Awesome game with simple rules, potentially agonizing decisions and a dash of luck.

~

Great first play with my wife although I got it handed to me by her. Love the risk-taking aspect of the game and how points are open so one knows how much one is lagging behind or ahead by. The end game can be quite a game-changer also especially when you're trying to maximize your points but do not want to hand your opponent(s) the cards on a silver platter! Nice!

Ahhh...treasures and artifacts! A nice fun 2-player card game! Z-man comes through again with a great card game in a small box! Purchase artifact pieces from the open market with your collected cards...it's that simple!

And the maps...the best part...use your maps to find the treasure in the pyramid! Most enjoyable!

Nice Quick Light Set Collection, Press Your Luck Card Game !! Great feel to gameplay !! Tense because those sandstorms and thieves are unavoidable. Fun with 2 players, but luck could give one player (say, my wife) most of the thieves. (Actually, for a 2-player game, I'd rather play Morels.) I haven't tried 3 or 4, yet. 

Graphics are okay, but they suit the theme and provide the layout for streamlined gameplay. Card quality is okay, but the game is inexpensive.

Good rummy-like card game, but has the same over-dependence on luck that Mystery Rummy has. If one player gets all the thieves and maps (which seems to happen surprisingly often), the other player is screwed. 

Interesting trading, and sandstorms are not as bad as I feared. Even less "take that" than Jaipur, so both are nice that way, but the thieves still feel a bit nasty. I think the sale values of Talisman and Mask are too low, and the pyramid cards should be 2-5-8 instead of 3-5-7.

My wife would only play without the thieves. While it would be ok to have for a game night filler, it's not the best in that role. And neither of us felt like we would ask to play it, so we traded it away.

Having played the New Expedition I like the way it has added the different monuments, which give variety, and I was never too sure about the power of the Pyramid. Not so sure about the tent cards.

Fun and different type of card game. Really feels like you're buying and selling artifacts, and I love grabbing the cards from the pyramid. Fun!

Archaeology is a light set-collection card game with a bit of a push-your-luck element.  During your turn, you draw a card, you can trade cards with the central market for their trade value, and you can play sets of cards to gain increasing numbers of points depending on how many you play.  Once the sets are played, the points are safe, but while they're in your hand, they can be subject to thieves, in which one player can take a random card, and sandstorms, during which players must discard half of their cards to the market.  There are also a few Map cards that can be turned in for various piles of random treasure cards, depending on how many Maps are turned in.  I wasn't a big fan of the take-that Thief cards, and the Map cards seemed really powerful, but other than that, this was a fairly entertaining filler.

We got this in late 2010 as a quick, light, portable game to take to bars or restaurants while we're waiting. I like that it plays 2-4, so my husband and I can play alone or with friends. The decisions aren't difficult, but it's entertaining and fun. We got it to replace Guillotine and Fluxx as the game I carry in my purse because we were getting tired of those.

Enjoyable set collection game with a fun theme. If you've ever had a fascination with the flimsy remnants of 3000 year old civilizations, the task this game sets of collecting potshards and fragments of papyrus will click. I wish there was just a bit more to the game, either in terms of cards with a play-for-effect power, or some tech tree you could advance along by selling your finds.

A little diamond in the rough! Got it in a trade and loving every second of it during my first 3 games. I love how thief and sand storm card works. In my opinion it is not that chaotic. Thief cards will make you not want too few cards in hand in order to "dilute" the chance that a good card will be stolen. On the flip side, a Sand Storm card will make you not want to press your luck too much. 

I feel 6 Sand Storm cards is about right for a 2 player game. I played the first game with only 4 Sand Storm card and it didn't offer enough tension so I added in the rest for 2 more games. 

My girlfriend think it is as fun as Jaipur.

I give it an 8/10. :)

I've played another 3 player game and it was also lots of fun.  The 9 year old beat us all.  I was trying to keep my cards too long to make big sets and sand storms kept coming up....  There is luck in the game but it seems great for families.

Have since played many 2 player games and it is definitely fun.  A light game for sure.  My wife, who is a non gamer really likes it so that's a plus!

Played a 4 player game Easter weekend and there is a fair amount of luck involved.  Nothing bad happened to me from the sandstorms and thieves and still was unable to win.  That's ok.  Everyone - light gamers - really enjoyed themselves and that's what matters for me.

Played another 4 player game during the 2012 holiday.  Everyone loved this game.  Again, my 10 year old won again and I didn't do too well.  Not my favorite game in the world but still fun and easy to learn/teach.

Pros and Cons for 2-Players

Pros:
- Small and portable.
- Not unattractive.
- I like the unlimited number of actions you can take in any order.

Cons:
- Setup is slightly annoying as you need to shuffle a second time after dealing out some of the cards.
- There's no strategy for Thieves when playing with 2.
- Sandstorms provide more frustration than tension.
- Unlimited number of actions means you have to indicate you're done after every turn.

= 2013-05-15 - R:6

Perhaps this would be more fun with more than 2 players, but with just 2 the thieves lose their ability to provide intentional interaction; it's simply a blind card swap between the only two players.

We like a healthy bit of luck and randomness in our games, but this game felt like press-your-luck was the domintant mechanic.

The setup is also somewhat cumbersome for such a quick game, requiring you to separate cards, shuffle, deal, make a few piles, return the separated cards, and then shuffle again.

Another game that fails the "is it better than 500 Rummy" test. Generously giving a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
1. Plays quickly
2. Despite the fast play there's good decision points.
3. Lots of flexibility

Cons:
1. Still decent amount of luck with what cards come out when. Bad draws can kill your chances to win the game.

Summary: Good filler game to start up a night or to fill down time between games. Plays short enough that any frustration from bad draws is short lived.

Family friendly card game of set collecting & cashing in at the right time.

I played this once at a friend's house and enjoyed it.  Its a very light, quick card game that I think would be a good fit to play with my family.

Basically players "exchange" cards with a pool of cards in the center table in the hopes of completing sets that score them points.  Some cards cost more than others, some are more common than others, and some are worth more than others when played in sets.  All of these factors weigh in on your choice to "go after" certain card types.  It can be risky to try and hold your cards too long before playing a set due to cards that force you to lose cards (like thief and sandstorm).

Probably will pick this one up because I think the fun factor is solid for its low price.

Update: I did pick it up.  Big hit with the family and suited well for children (5-12) in my opinion.

Set collection with spite as thiefs allow other players to take cards and sandstorms cause you to lose cards.  So a press your luck element with how long to hold and horde for bigger scores or not.

Kicsit a Babszüretre hasonlító játék, csak itt egymással közvetlenül nem cserélünk lapokat csak a piacot használva. A téma, a régészet megvalósítása szerintem nagyon eltalált a játékban. Kártyát húzva értékes vagy kevésbé értékes kincseket lelhetünk, amit eladhatunk a múzeumnak és annál több pontot szerzünk velük, minél többet adunk el egy fajtából, tehát érdemes őket gyűjtenünk. De sajnos tolvajok és homokviharok keseríthetik meg az életünket, akik elrabolhatják a gyűjtött kincseinket, illetve elsodorhatják javaink felét. Érdekes a piramis felfedezésének megoldása is a játékban. Gyors, pörgős kártyajáték, amiben a szerencsének lényeges szerepe van, de hát a régészetben is szükség van rá.

[2011-07-11]
Meglepően jól működik a játék ketten is, sőt a tolvaj miatt itt nem is lehet szemrehányást tenni, hogy miért pont tőlem lopott a másik játékos.

[2011-07-29]
Tökéletes családi játék, ami a gémerek igényét nem valószínű, hogy kielégíti a nagy szerencseszerep miatt, de családi játéknak tökéletes. Egymás után több parti is lejátszható a rövid játékidő miatt.

I enjoyed playing the game and like the mechanics. However, the value of the sets seems unbalanced which leads me to think that the game is broken. Eg, the 3 cost cards give 40VP if you have a set of 5. ie, cost 15 for 40VP. There is a 1 cost card that gives 15 VP for a set of 5. ie, cost 5 for 15VP. The cheaper cards seemed about the same value, but you didn't have to worry so much about the effects of the thieves and the sandstorm as you generally had less cards and lower value cards in your hand.

Reminds me a lot of Jaipur, in terms of trading goods from a common pile of goods and selling them for points.  The biggest difference is that in Jaipur, you may want to sell early to be the first to get the higher-valued point tokens.  In Archeology, you may want to sell early to avoid losing cards to sandstorms and thieves.  The map concept sounds neat in theory, but the map-to-reward ratio makes it a little lacking. Good game, overall, and plays up to 4.

A nice little filler, although after 1 play it seems to have a bit too much randomness (and ability to benefit from turn order and a luck starting deal). Still, it's quick and easy; definitely worth another play or two.

--- Summary ---
Create a random market of cards, and piles of cards near the pyramid (3 different numbers; available for purchase later by turning in 1, 2, or 3 maps). On your turn, draw a card from the deck; if it's one of the shuffled events, players will have to discard half their cards. Then, buy/sell into the market. May play cards to your display area, in sets of like types (bigger sets are worth more VP); once a set is played, you cannot add to it. The game ends after the last event card (or the end of the deck?). The player with the greatest value of sets played wins.

[Adventureland Games 2007 edition, 2nd printing] {Archeology, filler; hand management, trading, set-collection; scalable} Archaeology is a fast-paced and thematic card game. There's nothing new in the game system - players exchange their cards with a pool of public cards in order to build higher value.  (It reminds me of Samarkand) However, the system integrates with the theme nicely, which makes it enjoyable to play.  Players have to decide carefully when to sell, trade and hold cards.  It is important that players should deduce what cards other players are holding; otherwise, they may wait for some cards that will never come.  It's also lightly luck-pressing - players have to bet whether a sandstorm is striking so as to decide hold or sell cards. Luck draw is quite important but it is short enough from being annoying.  And, the luck presence is thematically correct.

The rule is short and intuitive. It is trivial to teach and learn. The sandstorm is a nice mechanic to prevent players from hoarding cards and it adds excitement to the game because one never knows what will happen.  The thieves may be too strong in 2p game (for my feeling) - when one player draws 6-8 of them, this can easily make the other player frustrated. The setup is a little bit troublesome for me :P The end game system is a little bit awkward, though.

The illustration is nice. The card stocks are thick enough for repeatable plays except there are printing marks at some card back.  The quality is very good for such a self-publishing game.  The price is a little bit expensive due to its low availability.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[Z-man edition] I am glad that it was picked up by Z-man.  It is a very good filler, worth higher popularity and more audiences.

What a random disaster.  Any planning is wiped out by the sandstorm and thief cards.  The game quickly devolves into a draw-go situation as you have to collect cards for several turns.

This game has a great idea, but it's implemented very poorly.

RATING: 5
Set collecting card game with a tenuous archaeological theme. The premise is very familiar, collect a group of matching cards and decide when to play them. The more you play of a certain set the more points you score. The difficulty arises from the fact that you can lose your cards whilst collecting them through a sandstorm, where they become available to all you opponents, or they can be taken by a thief, thereby passing to one of your opponents hands. The only real strategy that exists in the game is deciding on whether to concentrate on the higher scoring sets (which are harder to acquire as they are fewer in number) or try to gather a large collection of lower scoring sets. All in all, this type of game has been done many times now and I don't think 'Archaeology' does anything different to merit particular mention. That being said, it uses a well-worn mechanism that works.

tl;dr: good, but a few cards mess it up for me

This game has some cool ideas. The different types of artifacts have different values and payoffs. There is also tension for scoring your stuff before you loose it. But that's part of my issue with this game: the impact of the thiefs and, more so, the sand storms, can be pretty big and can potentially cost you your victory.
The thief isn't that useful as for the player of that card it is not better than randomly drawing a card from the deck in most cases. The sand storm can be pretty bad when the same player keeps on drawing those. It means that player has less chance of building up something to score before loosing it (that was me in this game).
I like the basic idea behind the game, but the random factor is just a bit too high for me.

Not much to say about Archaeology, except that it combines set collection with push-your-luck in a pretty enjoyable twenty minutes or so.  Unless someone at the table is taking the game too seriously, games can be a little noisy (always a good sign in my opinion), as there is a fair amount of chaos, and it happens to everybody.  A really good, very simple design that I recommend.

I will say this:  my opinion of the game might be slightly higher than usual, mainly because I can easily play this game with Annie, my 7 year old.  She really likes it, and frequently gets into the game quite a bit.  She doesn't understand the risk/reward idea very much, and instead plays it safe most of the time.  The confounding thing is that she beats me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but even for a filler it seems like there aren't enough options each turn. 

Update: Improving my rating once I started to realize that this is more of a push-your-luck game than anything else. You're collecting matching cards, but the real strategy comes in deciding whether to hold out for even more points, or to go ahead and play the cards you have before a thief or sandstorm hits.

Update: I like the game, but this didn't make the cut when paring down my collection and comparing it to my other light card games.

A nice set collection game with some interesting mechanics.

The market aspect was a little frustrating. Here are all these good cards, but I have nothing to trade for them, so I patiently collect some artifacts so I can pull off a nice combo -- then, blam, [i]another[/i] sand storm, and I have crap again.

But it's quick and I figure not all games play out like that.

Archaeology is an earlier effort from the same designer who would later publish Sushi Go - which lends credence to that old adage,  that practice,  does indeed,  make perfect.

I liked this game at first, but repeated plays exposed damaging flaws that served to fuel a high level of frustration. There are just too many cards that disrupt the flow of play,  which slowly whittles down the level of enjoyment to a grinding halt.  Despite all that,  it is light enough to sporadically merit the investment.

On the other hand,  should you have a domicile in close proximity to a desert,  perhaps you should place it on a random dune - walk away - and allow the coming sandstorm to do what it does best.

A nice game in the essence of the more famous Bohnanza (the more you get of something, the more is worth). Though no exchange can be made, there are cards for Thieves (which let someone take a card from another player) and the fearful Sandstorm (that make the players loose half, round down, of the cards currently in their hands to the market). There isn't much interaction between players (except when one is robbing another!), but the game is kind of fast, so it don't matter that much.

There is a timming pressure in the game, since the Sandstorms can really kill your plans, if you are holding too many cards - so players must always be weighting in the prospect of gaining more in the future and risking losing what they already have. There is also the considerations regarding the Pyramid: it has "chambers" with cards on them - the deeper the chamber, the more cards it has. In order to acess it, players need to use Map cards. One Map card can earn you 2 cards. Sweet. But two will net you 5 cards. Even better! Three Maps and you get in the inner chamber and gain 8 cards! But can you wait that much? If someone takes the first chamber cards, you will have to wait for another Map, and risking losing it to a Thief card.

[thing=31105][/thing] is this risk and hand management.

My problem with the game is the market. Since players lose cards to the market, after the Sandstorms, the Market can simply almost lock itself. Sure, you can gain one card per turn from the deck, but it can be too little to make the Market work for you again. There simply might be too costly cards in there, and they could keep there the whole game. I have some very uninteresting games due to this - the market became an afterthought and all there was left in the game was the luck of the draw.

However, I did have some nice games, also. In the end, [thing=31105][/thing] is a good enough filler.

I purchased Archaeology TCG and Jaipur at the same time and played those back to back with another player. I have to say that A:TCG has come up tops in a head-to-head battle. The biggest factor for A:TCG winning the comparison is the assignment of relative values for each good/ware. Unlike Jaipur, items that more abundant and hence, worth more are higher in trade value. Whereas, in Jaipur, one can trade in cloth or leather (cheapest) for diamonds and gold or jewels at a 1:1 exchange ratio. This breaks the game for us. Yes, A:TCG has a higher element of luck with thieves and sandstorm, but nothing you can't really prepare for since you know how many of those are out and how many are left. You can gauge the rather accurately the chances of the cards coming up. While they can be annoying, it is not a game breaker. Jaipur on the other hand, forces you to introduce new cards to the market when you take camels or take a card, any action that cannot be avoided. So, if valuables are drawn from the deck, your opponent will jump all over the cards gleeful and make a silly exchange like leather for gold. Highly annoying and also does not make thematic sense.

Hands down, archeology over Jaipur

I like the card-cycling mechanism (it reminded me faintly of the one in R-Eco), but it seemed like the game's mid- and endgame points were a little dull.  The middle of the game slows down as everyone is drawing a card to keep, working up toward trading in for a larger card, only to get stymied by a sandstorm before they can do anything significant.  My biggest points came from digging in the pyramid, where I could get a ton of cards all at one time, and from getting lucky draws off the deck.  As such, I was playing whatever sets I could from those cards, and that's where all my points came from.  I realized it was pointless to try to make sets from the marketplace, since the number of sandstorms and thieves in the deck meant I couldn't hold onto cards long enough to do anything with them.  It was more frustrating than anything else, but it's short enough that I want to give it a few more plays to see how it works out in the end.

You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert. Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid hoping to uncover a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.

But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!

This is one of the "go to games" for me and my wife.  It is quick and easy to set up.  It gives a bit of strategy and a bit of luck.  Nice and light, good for after a day of work or taking care of the kids.  A game that you can talk about the day while playing without it being detrimental to the play.  Plays in 30-40 mins.  

One aspect that my wife doesn't like is the robber and the sand storms.  This creates a bit more of a "push your luck" feel than she likes.  The robber is also a bit more of a direct negative interaction that she doesn't like (though she will happily place the robber on you in Catan without the faintest bit of guilt...)

Overall a pretty good game and it comes out very often in our house on week nights.  Nice way to spend some time together as we catch up with each others day and unwind.

Dig, Dig, Dig, it's what we like to do. Unless, of course, a giant sandstorm forces your to discard half of your hand into the shopping area and your wife hires a  thief to steal a random card. After that if you still have maps, you get to explore more of the pyramid... so it all works out.

Very fun game of set collection.  Light, quick, interactive.  Even though you can steal cards from your opponent, this never feels like a 'mean' game.  Great for family gatherings as it is easy to explain and doesn't have a huge footprint.  Replay value is high as long as you realize that the strategies are not deep and the luck factor can be very high.  :)

A completely arbitrary exercise in destruction and good fortune.  I now carry a pocket flamethrower in case anyone asks me to play this game (or whatever it is) again.

P.S. Maps, thieves, and sandstorms have now been banned from my house.

Love this game. My non-gamer buddies get the whole Rummy-ness of it. Wish the art wasn't so fugly.

Good light filler card game.  Requires a lot of shuffling for setup, and isn't very deep or strategic, but makes up for this with the fast, fun gameplay.

This and Fairytale are my two favorite quick card games. Archaeology is a set collection game that also incorporates selling, trading, stealing and random events that can help or hinder each player. The game is quick- it can be played in about 10 minutes, but there is a surprising amount of thought that must go into about half of your moves. With more play, my rating may go even higher. Definitely a must buy!

First several games I did not enjoy very much. It is better now. I have learned to play it a little better and I know what to expect. I leave one additional sandstorm out and that seems to give a little more planning ability without making it veer into simple set collection.

Update: Has stayed constant for me but has become very popular with my family. In regular rotation currently.

Update: Bumping up .5 to a solid 7. Light but more fun the more I have played it. No reservations about this being a favorite very light filler.

Great concept and nice choice mechanics for the cards you have, but the game is essentially dependent on your luck of drawing cards.

Simpel card game. Easy rules. Enjoyable to play. I just think there is a slight flaw in this - in that we always end up being unable to trade at the end because we have less valuable cards than whats left in the middle, and the end of the game peters out just a bit. But its not a serious issue.

A great, simple card game easily taught to folks who haven't played much past Uno. The sandstorm and thief cards keep the game interactive and tense. The quality of the Z-Man edition is top-notch, as well.

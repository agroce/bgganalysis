Having been a naval officer and invovled in many of the matters covered by the "Fleet" games- I found the entire series lacking- unrealistic, and mechanically obtuse at points in my opinion. I think SPI's Task Force was mechanically better (although lacking some information as to be expected). In fairness, I should say that I and my gaming buddies played the heck out of the Fleet games as *games*- regularly and there were moments of fun- but it might was well have been some alternate science fiction setting as far as simulating modern naval operations. Hence an over all 5 from me- (game fun- a 7, realism--- wayyy lower).

Weakest of the series.  The only one I enjoy playing now is the NATO scenario.  I recently (2/2008) played the Red Sea Lion scenario from the General Magazine,which is pretty good.

RATING: 9
The last, best looking, least available, and most quirky entry into the series, with 3 separate maps on 3 different areas (Caribbean, Eastern Atlantic and Pacific). Rules are updated and modified in small but significant areas, which would have been great to retrofit onto the older games. The quirky theatres seem to leave some people a little cool, and they lack both the size of the other games (in map acreage), and the classic nature of conflicts in the Med or the GIUK gap. Nevertheless, the core Fleet quality is in evidence - a very playable engine, with some subtle effects - linked to some very tightly written scenarios around lesser 'known' hypotheticals. I think I have a preference for others in the series, but this is a great addition and worth the slightly outrageous price I paid. Best cover in the series as well.

3rd Fleet was pretty much irrelevant when it was released but still worth playing.  Changes in map style are a matter of taste but a good mix of (mostly) improbable scenarios.

Ultimo titolo della serie, una sorta di "riepilogo" di alcune zone potenzialmente coinvolte in scontro WWIII anni '80-'90.
Grafica con vista "da satellite" secondo me poco riuscita.

The last of the fleet games so the most up to date. More accurate  then the earlier  games  but with more die rolling . I must say the VG games rule books are some of the best I ever read always  clear and easy to understand.

The final entry in my favorite game series.  Interesting scenarios, and still gives a great overview of modern naval operations.

More options than 2nd Fleet on the counters. But not got the North Atlantic feel. Nation mix different, but not necessarily better. Again rules for two sets, a GM and just seeing what your side has detected is what the game cries out for.

One of the few games I played quite a bit. I liked that it had both big and small scenarios.  As the USSR, the question was always - how long would my measely surface fleet survive -one or two turns, but then, in come the long range missile armed bombers. Hated the Tomcats - vastly over-rated. As were the Russian Yak-36s.  As a game though, interesting mechanics, almost beer and pretzels, but end results believable.

The Fleet Series is a lot of fun as a simple challenge between two players, as NATO tries to impose their superiority over the WARSAW Pact. Series does not include many intelligence gathering methods of the period. The Map and counters are superb, and the game is rather easy to learn with well written rules.

A very complicated hex & counter game of modern naval warfare.  I do like this game but it is very indepth.  I always wanted a game like this & it fits the bill.  Being a SQUAD LEADER vet, I was able to overlook the complex nature of the game & after reading the rules three times, my best friend & I gave it a shot.  We liked it enough to get the other games in the series.  Using surface-to-surface missles to take out cruisers & destroyers was a lot of fun.  The idea of combining ALL the games from the series into a mega-naval warfare game intrigued us but we only managed to aquire one other game in the series.  As we played, we kept saying:  "This is a good game, but there has to be a way to simplify it!"

Victory Game's modern fleet series. Perceivably a complex air-sea joint operations simulation, at the core of the game is really a simple operations-driven system. The game focuses on the world stage hotspot where potential conflict might have erupted into full-scale war between Soviets and the US and his NATO allies. All the battleships, cruisers, destroyers ,submarines, aircraft carriers are all included in accordance with the historical fleet designation, not to mention the dozen types of all the modern air fighters. Different types of sea-air operations are simulated with various scenarios and scenario lengths. The fleet series games introduce many modern military doctrines and concepts like Combat Air Partorl (CAP), area sea search, aircraft readiness, the strengthened role of aircraft carriers as distinguished from naval assets and the joint operation between navy and air forces. Combined arms concept move from between different land forces (tank & infantry & artillery) to air and naval forces (bomber & fighter & battleship). A much more effective regional war effort is amplified by the modern war machine capabilities.  3rd Fleet covers  North Pacific, Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans where, in my view, have been the least likely areas conflicts would spring out. An excellent game and an interesting interactive designs. You can have a lot of food for thoughts while playing this game.

This gets a lower rating because there is the distinct lack of a campaign game.  IT plays like the others with a few variations.  I like the way the turn order works better though.  Although you could have a situation where you do all three actions at once.

This was the first play, it might go up.  We found the combat mechanics rather boring.  The idea of area defense and close defense was a good one, the execution was cumbersome, but that's to be expected of "old school" games.  What was not forgivible was the apparently arbitrary 20% "all of your shots miss from every ship" rule, as well as the other half of the "who can you hit in the target stack" rule.  Both seemed counterintuitive, and I can't think of any given simulation value for every single ship in a 12-ship task force to miss the target completely.

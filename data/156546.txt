[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

This is a very fun party game, but you don't need to bother with spending 25 bucks on some prefilled cards -- you can play the game just as well with your own cards, and that way you don't run the risk of no one in your group recognizing a name. Runs very long for what it is, though, especially when you tack extra rounds on the end of it.

I though first that that would be dumb game. Also I thought that having too much people I don't know would make this impossible. But there was short text telling who he was so even I could play. Also there was much historical characters etc. aswell. (and Doge).

Amazing...is the word I would use on this game. You would think it is just a charades game but it is so much more. The thing is unlike other charades games, even if you do not know the word, on the cards is a description if you need it or throughout the game, you will learn through memory the card with different associations. 

The different round levels of hints from sentences to words to gestures also keeps the game fresh and the game does not outstay it's welcome. 

Downsides are the teams need to be equal amounts of people if you really want to be fair and the more creative the people the more fun it is but I still feel with most crowds the game will work.

In conclusion, the game is a must buy and good for new and old gamers alike.

Surprisingly fun and challenging party game.

The cards can seem impossible to convey to your partner/team, but you manage to find a way. Going deeper in levels seems daunting at first, and very nerve wracking, but it just works! The cards and clues just flow so well since you have a context built from previous rounds. You aren't just blinding acting a thing out like basic charades, being forced to be funny, rather your team knows what words are available in the active deck, and can narrow down what your clues are quickly. The funniness just comes with the game naturally. You don't have to try, it just happens. Watching the other team is equally as funny.

you could of course play this with some paper and a hat, but the production quality on this deck is great, and some annoyingly impossible cards aside, it boasts some great clues. Shirtless Vladimir Putin is miles more interesting than Vladimir Putin, for example. Incredibly entertaining and fun, though the laughs really come in in the 3rd round.

Played for the first time with a group of four. Initial suspicion on the part of the rest of the players due to some of the esoteric cards gave way to hilarity and multiple plays into the wee hours of the morning. The game never stalls on an unfamiliar card thanks to the emphasis on skipping. The third round is magical coming after the first two. Can't wait to play with a large group.

I generally don't like 'guess who/what' type party games. The structure of the three rounds from description to single word and then no word (action) all utilizing the same set of cards allowed the unknown name/place/thing to be familiar enough to the group that a successful answer/guess would happen for every card.  I would play this again, it was an interesting and sometimes enlightening challenge.

With the right group of people Monikers is a box of fun. The production quality is great on the box and I love that there is absolutely no wasted space inside the box.

Because you go through your game's unique deck 3 times, the charades round becomes hilarious! Some of my favorite moments over the last year have come from Monikers.

There are a couple downsides to Monikers

- Some of the references are pretty obscure. Part of the fun of this game is trying to come up with clues, but if you get too many weird ones in your hand it can feel a little disheartening.

- Some of the cards are on the...risque side. If you play with kids or sensitive folks you'll need to go through and take out some cards before you play.

There is nothing in the gameplay of Monikers that makes it particularly revolutionary. However, making you use the same deck over and over in increasingly difficult ways of conveying the message creates a unique meta-culture in each and every game. That is what makes it brilliant.

RATING: 7
As extra Time's Up cards, Monikers is a blessing. There's a lot more recent pop culture / internet + nerd culture stuff in here that works well for our group (although as always there's a few nobody recognized). But as its own game, Monikers doesn't hold up quite so well.

All of the rules changes feel wholly unnecessary. We had a group of game designers sitting around feeling puzzled at, well, all of them. In literally every instance, I preferred the Time's Up rules:

-Round 2 is now incredibly boring for the cluegiver and thus the guesser. You may as well pass if your partner doesn't guess it, as all you can do is repeat the same word.

-You play with fewer cards, which when combined with the increased time limit makes the game unworkable if you're playing with only 4 (which is mostly how we play the game). We tried the "co-op" variant and didn't care for it, but I could see how it might be fun for a less experienced group.

-The time limit is 60 seconds instead of 30. It just feels too long, especially if you're good at the game.

-Infinite guesses every round just isn't as fun. The stakes don't increase over the course of the game, so I prefer the stricter (but perhaps a bit less intuitive) guessing in Time's Up - there's more tension and more laughs when people mix something up or spout out something crazy out of nervousness.

-The point system is just pointless (HAH!). The notion of something so varied and group-dependent as "difficulty" here is completely absurd (everyone who plays will take issue with some of the highest and lowest valued cards, I guarantee it) so it only serves to lengthen the score-counting... and who wants that???

This isn't a rules thing but more of presentation, but I DO like the definition of people on the cards. It changes the game a little, maybe even for the worse (always hilarious when someone has to rely totally on knowledge/memory and starts describing entirely the wrong person), but the sheer amount of people I've met who are either hesitant to play or refuse to play because "they don't know people" who now WILL play makes up for that.

I thought they would be funny, but the Cards Against Humanity-style cards like "Your clone" and "just your skeleton"... I could do without these. The funniest part is encountering them ONCE, and they're just sort of a not-funny pain in the ass to deal with in-game.

Still, this is better than no Time's Up/Celebrities style game at all (hence the 7) and I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone to be used with the Time's Up ruleset. If I was going to recommend a Celebrities style game to someone who'd never played one before, though, I would stick with Time's Up.

Good party game in the vein of times up. We don't score the points on the cards, rather each card counts as one. I haven't played too much Times up but can see already that Monikers is a little bit easier, which could be a good thing. There is quite the variety inside the box, it's all very interesting. Definitely a game that is lots of fun and worth checking out.

I'm sort of surprised this game exists, because it's literally the same as Time's Up! with the minor change of assigning point values to cards, so some clues are more challenging and thus worth more points.

There's absolutely no reason to have both games, so if you happen to find this one cheap, go for it.

DISCLAIMER: I was part of the beta testers for this product.

I'm a huge fan of the party game Time's Up.  This game takes more modern, "hip" topics and applies the same mechanism.

Now, anyone who's anyone knows that Time's Up power is in its sheer volume of cards.  The rules for Time's Up and Moniker are both from the public domain game "Celebrity".  My concern for Moniker is that it may not have the staying power of Time's Up due to it being so timely, and perhaps not having the depth of cards.  But, even if I'm not playing it five years from now, who cares? I think I'll still get lots of plays out of it.  I anxiously await my Kickstarter official release version, which should be here soon.

Good social party game. Each player chooses about 5 cards to put in the 'deck' for the game. Then in turns each player has 60 seconds to get their team to guess as many cards as they can. Where it gets good is in the second round they are only allowed one word to get their team to guess the same set of cards, and in the final round, no words, only charades.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really fun party game.  The progression of going through the same deck through all three rounds is really enjoyable and makes for some great inside jokes over time.

Just don't forget to pay attention as the game goes on because remembering past cards can be a real advantage and not remembering them can be a real disadvantage during rounds 2 and 3.

Basically is Time's Up with cards that sometimes have an explanation of what the moniker means.

[Variant] Extra round as suggested by SU&SD: charades with only your head visible.  Challenging and hilarious.

Lots of fun!  Works better than the typical Fishbowl/Celebrity game, simply because it comes with the name cards and includes descriptions.  Some of the cards themselves are pretty funny without being crude.

Highly language-dependent, because the lengthy descriptions are all in English.

Also rewards cultural knowledge; a number of the names would be well-known by Americans but completely unknown by many others.

Some of the cards are randomly NSFW, though these can be removed beforehand if the game owner doesn't mind previewing all the cards.  The initial card selection (choose 5 of the 10 dealt to you) mitigates this, but it still has the players reading the objectionable cards.

This is a really good set of cards for one of my favourite party games. You can play it with a pen and paper, but this set of cards allows you to get going earlier, and stretch the players of the game a bit more, often with humorous results.

It also takes away some the (very small) issues you can get when players don't know who someone is, by having it printed on the cards for them to read out.

Great fun with friends, I don't think it'd go over so well with strangers.  The cards are the right mix of pop culture, history, and silly for me to really enjoy.  One notable downside is that with the relatively small pool of cards and how quickly you burn through them, it is very easy to become familiar enough with the deck that it is unfair versus people who have never played before.

I don't really "own" this game although I would really love to. However, this game is best played in your mother tongue and since there is no dutch version, I make up my own cards with the people I play with. (UPDATE: I now have some of the expansions cards and I'll try to play it with English cards)

Now, for the actual game. I believe this to be the best game out there that you can play with just pen and paper. This game makes me laugh so loud at nonsensical words, just because of the meaning this game gives to these words.

It's elegant, it's brilliant, it's easy to play over-and-over, and it creates the most important thing of all - memories.

Less set up time than just playing Celebrities with paper and pencil, and there are some great cards in this version.  I still prefer the flexibility of Celebrities, but this is a great way to introduce the game to new players.  It needs an additional rule to clarify that you can not say the words in an acronym to give clues.

It goes by many names: Celebrity, Time's Up, Throwing Bits of Paper In a Punch Bowl and Acting Them Out, Monikers, etc., and it's one of my favorite party games because it scales well for any (even) number of people in any setting. It's an active, fast-paced game of acting, memory, and communication. My Paulo is famously pop-culture-ignorant but is a master of getting people to guess the names on any card by his brilliant clues. Being savvy with pop culture or the arts isn't a must, but it can help. The key to the game is communication. And after heavy strategic games of two-plus hours, it's a welcome break. Or after Thanksgiving dinner with your fam. Or at a gaming convention, to the annoyance of all other tables in your vicinity. Needless to say, the editions of Time's Up having gone out of distribution and out-of-date, our group had all but memorized the cards which was no fun for anyone. The other problem with Celebrity is that your group will inevitably end up with multiple cards of Cersei Lannister or Michelle Obama or anybody else swirling in the current zeitgeist. (One fix is to assign people to specific eras/forms of art/genres but that takes away the thrill and fun of the game.) So I'm very glad that Monikers can fill this void for our group. One of the best elements of Monikers is that it varies from the easy (Julius Caesar) to the ridiculously hard ("The Astronaut Who Drove Across the Country Wearing Space Diapers and to Kidnap Her Boyfriend"), and they're weighted scores, so the former only yields one point and the latter is four points. And there is a healthy mix of both. Plus, there are some cards which are just plain art (like the Cat Lady, or Lord Ganesh). With only one play, our group instantly liked the tougher but more interesting cards, as we all ended up learning something (I, who thinks of himself as knowledgeable in current events and art, was ignorant of former Congressman Anthony Weiner's nomme-de-sext, Carlos Danger.) Whatever the occasion or number of people, I wholeheartedly recommend Monikers for any fan of Celebrity or Time's Up.

Tried this out last week and everyone didn't like it...BUT we only played the first round.  Everyone did not understand that you will not know many of the things on the cards, BUT YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LEARN IT.  I can see this working out better if people are handed more cards (11 instead of 8) and they pick less cards (3 instead of 5).  I believe with that one house rule fix and if it was given the chance to last all 3 rounds it would work out pretty well.

RATING: 10
So hard to fault this game. This does not have the same issues found in games like Cards Against Humanity whereby you are required to know pop culture and other categories. This gives you descriptions for you to understand but this is not a game whereby people vote on how creative you are vs other players. You work as a team to create ways for your teammates to guess the cards. With each round, a certain limitation is applied in regards to how you give clues to your teammates. This is indeed a clever memory game and a lot of laughs to be had when played.

While this is a great party game, I fear it suffers from the same detriment several other games that have static topics.  After a few plays, you will learn the cards and need new cards.  If you are constantly playing with new people, this won't be a problem.

This game can make for some really funny conversations.  I highly recommend it, even for people who aren't particularly interested in charades type of games.

I didn't think much of this when I first heard about it. Then I played it and it has completely blown me away. Such a clever design and a riot to play. It can definitely succumb to CAH disorder, where once you play the same cards with the same group multiple times, the shine wears off and it gets super easy and not as fun. It will need to be endlessly expanded to stay relevant, but I really like it.

This is a much, much better take on Time's Up.  The card topics are much better.  The addition of points based on difficulty is nice and evens things out.   Having a description of the item on the card makes it so anyone can attempt to describe the card.   Finally, the being allowed to skip rule removes a ton of frustration and makes for a much better game.

The more I play Monikers, the less I enjoy it. Perhaps this is a product of not purchasing the expansions to keep it fresh, or finding hidden role games more interesting lately. Regardless, I could not get enough of this game for awhile after my initial play, and other people often feel the same way. Overall, it's a very solid party game.

RATING: 7
I didn't think this game would be too great because the concept starts off very similar to Taboo and/or Charades. 

However, after you play a round you really see where it shines. It makes you create a specific deck out of their cards that will be used for the entire play. This causes your group to eventually create inside jokes relating to certain people or words since the same deck is played in three rounds with different rules. The rounds build on each other and become very fun, especially at the end.

My group of friends had a lot of fun with this even though we didn't know some of the words/people. Easy to learn, lots of fun.

Gary really likes this even though in concept the game isn't his cup of tea.  Lots of laughs and good times.

This may be my favorite party game. However, last time I played the teams were not divided equally amongst the young and old, and the older players did not seem to enjoy themselves. There seems to be more cards that reference geek culture than just normal pop culture, so that's something to be aware of depending on who you intend to play with. Otherwise, this game is a laugh a minute. Or rather many laughs a minute.

I'm not sure how to rate this.  Time's Up is basically my favorite game, and this is mostly that.  However, the cards are stupidly easy, and the point system is horrible and has to be ignored.  So this is a box of easy Time's Up cards, some of them with some art on them, most of them with completely unnecessary explanations on them.  I wouldn't recommend it unless your group just finds Time's Up way too hard, and then just make sure you ignore the point system and just play by Time's Up's ruleset.

Played a second time, and that cardset was much more interesting and difficult.  I'm more excited about playing this now.  I would still never play by the horrific ruleset, though.

An absolutely hilarious party game that will shine with the right group of people, especially with higher player counts. Playing the same deck of cards across three different rounds (starting off with a Taboo-esque round, then a single word clue, then ending in Charades) is the really ingenious thing and will reward those with keen recall skills. I have never been the hugest fan of Charades, but because of the content of the cards and the prior knowledge of their content from the previous two rounds, it makes for more outrageous acting and silliness than might otherwise be present. We had an absolute ball with this. Will be buying the other expansions.

Fun, boisterous, silly, but the fact is that first round is kind of boring. It's essentially a very easy trivia game until the second round injects some Codenames style hinting. The third round makes for one of the best variants of charades I've seen, with increasingly weird things. Gesturing out obscure concepts like Cylon or Damien Hirst is actually fun and quite funny. Up to that point, though, it's just decent.

My game group likes to play [thing=1353][/thing], so someone picked up Monikers to get a fresh batch of cards.  These cards felt a bit easier than Time's Up, but I can't say for sure if they are strictly easier or just more recent.  

Otherwise, there are two minor changes. First, they assign different point values on each card.  This seemed totally arbitrary and I don't see why anyone would actually use them.  Second, they included a one to two paragraph description on each card in case you don't know what it is.  As someone that has a terrible memory, I really appreciated this because it made me feel less stupid.  But, on the other hand, it can sometimes be fun to watch people flail when they have no idea what something is.

Fun party game. I was skeptical about the final round, where you have to act out the clues, but it's not bad because you have went through all of the cards twice by that point and everybody has a decent idea of what you're trying to convey.

Similar to Telestrations and Concept, this is a game where the points don't really matter and our group just plays it as a fun activity. That said, the cards may start to wear a bit thin and these particular ones are to be best enjoyed by a younger crowd (one that spends a lot of time online in spaces with high meme exposure. For a group of college students it works really well, but other groups might find it less charming and fun. (10-20-17)

This is a party game that reimplements Celebrities (also known as Time's Up).

The game is played in three rounds. Each round uses the same cards, so you learn them over time. You take the deck of cards and try to get your team to guess as many as you can in a minute. Each card you get right you keep as points for your team. In the first round, you're trying to get your team to guess the word/phrase by describing it without using the actual words. In the second phase, you are restricted to using a single word to describe the card. And in the third phase, you have to get them to guess the word using charades.

This is firmly a party game, but it's fun. In our play David Carradine got pegged with auto-asphyxiation in the first round which lead to a great charades round for that clue.

Players take turns attempting to get their teammates to guess names by describing or imitating well-known people.

In the first round, clue givers can say anything they want, except for the name itself. For the second round, clue givers can only say one word. And in the final round, clue givers can’t say anything at all: they can only use gestures and charades.

I've had some great times with this game.  I love the 4 person co-op variant a lot too. It's super fun to race against the clock and there are ways to change the rules to make it easier or harder depending on your groups experience. Super Fun party game. Prepare for people to do offensive things sometimes.

Explain random celebrities to your team. First round explanation is freeform, second round only a single word, and third round no words at all.

I’ve played Cards Against Humanity a few times and while I enjoyed myself while playing, I always feel bad about it afterwards. I’ll typically play it as long as the group knows each other, but even then I’m not the biggest fan. I’ve tried to find similar games that produce as many laughs without the guilt, but I’ve never been really satisfied with any of them. Monikers on the other hand, does a great job of providing laughter while also having a fun game that doesn’t make you feel like a bad person.

Monikers is essentially Times Up! with updated cards. You create a card pool by dealing 8 cards to each player and having them discard 3. You shuffle those together and you’re ready to play. During a game of Monikers your goal is to end up with as many points as possible by correctly guessing clues. The game is played over three rounds and each round has one turn per player. In the first round you can use as many words as you want, in the second you can only use one word, and in the third you’re playing charades. During your turn, you’ll have one minute to provide clues in an attempt to get rid of as many cards as possible by having the other players correctly guess. At the end of the round, you’ll shuffle all of the cards you just played with and start a new round.

In our game we didn’t keep score, we treated it mostly as an activity which is exactly how I like to play these games. I’m here to have fun, not win. Still, you had a sense of how well you were doing, so it kept you competitive. This game is a perfect example of something short, simple, and rules light that’ll work great with a group of friends or strangers. I highly recommend you pick it up when it comes back into print.

They absolutely need to rewrite their instructions. No one I know plays this correctly, they do one of two things wrong which make the game devolve into one of the most depressing experiences. They end the round before all the cards have been solved or They don't create a community deck from everyones picked cards. Also I highly recommend giving each player 15-20 cards to choose 5 from.

Nice to have this diverse stack of cards to play - the explanations on the cards make the game accessible for everyone. But a lot of cards refer to American culture, which makes a bit hard for us Europeans :P

A party game for 4 or more players. Players attempt to get their team to guess what card they have based on descriptions, then a one word description, then charades.

Awesome party game. You can use house rules to raise the level of ridiculousness. Try a round with only hands, for example.

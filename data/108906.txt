This is once again a genre that is not my thing, but if I was, this is probably the best implementation I have yet played. I like it better than Formula D in a number of ways. It feels much more tactical and even strategic in long range planning. The card flow can determine your fate perhaps too much, but in general, the game is very well balanced. Timing is important in all aspects - especially in your pit stops which I believe is also a critical part of racing. So I like it!

I never thought that I'd like a game about NASCAR.  I'm not a racing fan at all. And card driven racing?  Never would have thought that would work.

This game surprised me quite  a bit!  There are decisions that need to be made.  It's not just how quickly can I get to the end.

"I'm not a huge fan of race games."  (I lead off comments/remarks about race games with that BIG caveat.)

Thunder Alley is a good race game, but most definitely not one I'm particularly interested in playing.  The card draw is critical.  A poor draw *usually* will lead to a bad turn.

And it's that *usually* part that also bugs me.  Your performance is a combination of how well you play, how well you draw, and how well other people don't screw you.  If your cars get caught on the wrong side of a break and you find yourself unable to quickly close the gap, one (or more) of your cars is out of contention and (in theory) it wasn't your fault.  If that's the kind of race game this wants to be, it can go be that without my complicity because that ain't my idea of fun.

"Oh look, he broke the chain and now I'm stranded and, what's that?  The next player is pulling the whole chain forward without me?  Now I'm 8 spaces back, I can't close the gap, and I'm out of it.  Lovely."

Far too much uncontrolled (and uncontrollable or unmitigatable) swing for my taste.

RATING: 7
1st play: Perhaps my favorite race car game so far, although the bar is set pretty low.  The card play works well and races have lots of jockeying for position.  Random events evoke some of what I'm sure is part of the Nascar experience and cars have to pit, and draft and all of the things you expect from a good race car game.

2nd play: Tons of cool ways cars can jockey for position, the tracks are a little boring but the cars feel fast and getting a good draft movement can be really exciting.  I like the system and now having played both this and Grand Prix, I like that this one makes forward displacement expensive, and lateral displacement pushes cars to the side.  The more frequent yellow flags mean that you're never out of the race, which is a good thing, but if there are too many, it can detract.

Great game that simulates well the feeling of squads on Nascar, there is a lot of randomness in this game, but all of it is part of a well thought thematic game, I enjoyed a lot.

RATING: 7
A very simple concept game that is family fun for all ages. 

Rules for all the 4 different ways to move is not specifically clear. If this game has gone thru the numerous test runs, than they have not done a good job in translating it to words on the rule book. 

Overall, if the rules were interpreted accurately, it would be a fantastic game. If we were only 1% lacking in accuracy, than the game would have has errors committed throughout and thus make the game fun but might have caused a wrong win or lost. 

Overall, a good feel for a racing game. Slows down tremendously with a fun compliment of 7 players.

I like auto racing games so I had to give this a try. The game gives the of team racing better than any game I have ever seen. The effect of going to the pit and racing under a yellow flag has been abstracted to speed up play. This game has been designed to appeal to gamer rather than fans of racing.

I was looking for a racing game for a long time to round out my collection, and I'm so glad that I landed on this one.  I was worried when I first opened the box that it would be overly complex, mostly because it is a GMT game, and they can be overwhelming for a lot of people.  I bought a racing game to have fun with others, not to stress them out.  This game is awesome.  It is not overly complicated.  It is just the right amount of complexity to make it hugely enjoyable.  So glad I went with this game.

A two hour game with a level of chaos I'd find tolerable in a thirty minute filler.  The element of chains of cars pushing and pulling each other around the circuit to mutual benefit is interesting and can be exploited with sensible play.  However, at all times a poor hand of race cards, the actions of others or an event card can screw you. 

Production quality is to GMT's best standards.  The race tracks are entirely functional and easy on the eye.  The rules are readable and reasonably complete.

Enjoyable NASCAR racing game where thematic 'drafting' (in the motor racing sense) keeps you involved on other people's turns.  Can get unlucky though, particularly with events, which happen every turn.

Ok racing game. I didn't like that no matter what I did I was getting damage every turn (I never once saw a card that didn't give damage). I like the drafting mechanic, but I think I'd rather play Grand Prix or Ave Caesar.

Good game.  Does give you the feeling of being in a pack of NASCAR cars and picking the right time to perform drafting, overtakes and other manouevres.  Can be bad if you get your timing wrong and you end up losing cars early on.

RATING: 9.6
Aside from a few irritating (but not essentially damaging) printing mistakes, for me this game is nearly perfect. It is a masterpiece in design.

A group that play primarily light games allowed me to bring this to the table because I was practically frothing at the mouth about it, and the six of them ended up loving it. We've played 6 and 7 player games of it, and we'll be starting an eight race season pretty soon.

I've played it with 'non-gamers' in a foursome and it went down a storm there too.

I've also played it with a pretty hardcore group of gamers (in a 3, 4 and 5 player format) and everyone was a fan of it there.

It even seems to work with two players, though it is a very different game.

I highly recommend using a 2-lap race for your introductory game. Thoroughly explaining the draft mechanic, particularly how lateral moves are allowed only before forward movement (and linking) begins, and also covering corners, will pretty much guarantee you don't need anything more than a ten-minute explanation of rules.

The yellow flag mechanic might not be for everyone, but it serves as a highly effective catch-up mechanic and feels flavourful too.

I've heard a lot of complaints about 'unlucky' card draws, getting stuck at the back and what not. But the tactics here are clearly about piggy-backing other players in large groups and working together if you're behind. Managing a 'bad hand' of cards and competing with the rest of the pack in spite of them, for me, is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had with board games for a long, long time.

I genuinely believe this is an excellent game that has ensured every person I've shown it to feels like a racing team leader. It's a monster.

Later edit: be prepared that as you start to get above 4-players, the game becomes ludicrously chaotic. We enjoy this but I would imagine that most people won't. If you want a really tight, tactical game - keep it to four or five.

RATING: 7.5
A very good car racing game. Maybe better than Formula De, a game that I've enjoyed for quite a while.

Thunder Alley doesn't seem to be about building a medium term strategy. It's very tactical, in which you try to make the best of your cards given the situation on the track when it is your turn again.

I like the coopetition aspect of the game, where you try not to be alone in the track and get a few "rides" with other cars due to the ingenious linking mechanism.

And the damage tokens make for a great catch-up mechanism that really adds a lot to the overall theme.

The only thing that prevents me from giving Thunder Alley a higher grade is the large quantity of yellow flags and restarts that can happen on a 2-lap race. My friends and I got the feeling that everyone was being mashed together all the time, benefiting those that stayed behind, and the only thing that really mattered is what you do on the last 3 turns.

I gotta play some more to understantd if this is a fact.

But it is a pretty fun game nonetheless.

Another one of those themes that I just wouldn't expect to enjoy very much, and yet Thunder Alley is so rich with racing fun that I have no other alternative than to be impressed. Comes with two double-sided, huge mounted boards, and you use cards/hand management to regulate your movement. The interesting thing here is you will be playing teams of cars: the fewer the player count, the more cars, and the game is so tight that learning the proper movement becomes critical...which it should, because it's a RACING GAME. Kudos to GMT in how they manage to diversify so successfully away from their fundamental war games.

8/1/15: A good race game, forces you to think as to what benefits the team, vs the individual cars.  It seems to me that the push your luck aspect with the pit stops isn't as much of a risk as it could be.  

Very good production quality.  Maybe it's just my eyes, but I had a hard time reading the numbers on the the top of the race cars.  Every time I play a GMT game it reminds me of how much better their cards are than FFGs.  

To me there was nothing special that makes this game shine over other race games.  Also, with 2 players I'd recommend something else.  For me, race games just don't shine with 2 players.

More of a card game then a NASCAR game.  You play cards to move various cars on the track trying to get the best finish for your "team" of cars.  I hoped this would be a great sim. for the strategies of NASCAR.  NOPE!  Can be fun with the right people.

Initial Impression: This race game features easy rules, quick turns, and fun play. Racing as a team rather than a single car adds an interesting dimension to the game. The card driven mechanism works exceptionally well and provides a substantial feeling of tactical choice as well as thematic flavor. I'm inclined to believe that this game could work as a gateway or party game.

RATING: 8
I like racing games and this one is a good one. Formula motor racing for pro's. 4 different movement cars make the game very exciting. Sometimes you are at the end of a pack and withour playing you are becoming at a very interesting place. A lot of interaction between the cars and a feeling of a real speedwayrace. In my opinion a bit too much yellow flag cards, but on the other hand, a player on the loosing site can come back in the game. There is certainly a deal of luck in the game, but by choosing the right lines of cars that haven't played yet, you can alter your luck in chances.

RATING: 8.5
Very fun. This rating might go up (I've only played once). I would have liked car meeples à la Kanban and perhaps some player aids for people who struggle with the different movement categories.  But those are minor quibbles.

In addition to the core game, I do love how the teams have specific owners and how the racers have names — adds some great storytelling to the game (ie. Aya and Devin Fraley, potential siblings on separate teams!)

A very good card driven race game.  Everyone who is playing has a TEAM of racers...up to six cars.  It's a very tactical game.  Those who have to plan out will probably not like this.  Personally, I dig race games and I do like a good tactical game.  It is fairly quick and it has a nice thematic feel to it.  Plus, I love the production.  The cars, even though they are chits, look awesome and add to the game.  I'm looking forward to playing this again, soon.

RATING: 5
Was expecting to like this much more than I did, definitely glad I tried it before buying (as I won't be).

Stuff I didn't like:
Very tactical, each turn is a case of deciding which cards to play on which of your cars and in which order. Get a hand of high cards that damage your cars, tough ... get a hand of low cards, pray your cars don't get pushed out of position and hope you'll get pulled along with the pack. Seems best way to do well is be liked by your opponents so your cars get help.

There's little control here, but you have the illusion there is and the downtime while players consider their optimal moves. For me this kills it - either give me control for the thinking (and more strategy in the pits, car setup etc), or make it super simple so the turns roll along at a pace suitable for a high speed race game. 

Ave Caesar this isn't and I'd pick Daytona 500 over this every time if I wanted a NASCAR game to play.

Rating likely to fall if I play it again, I'm in no rush to though ...

RATING: 1
Niche - children's game

Integration of Theme - none (conveys zero feel of stock car racing, except for some idiot inevitably yelling "vroom" after few seconds)

Luck Factor - high (blind card draws)

Drag Factor - high (a player can easily, through no fault of his/her own, be out-of-contention within the first 15 minutes)

Strategy/Tactics Ratio - none (the game has no strategy)

Depth/Weight Ratio - none (Chutes & Ladders has more depth; this game is for six-year-olds)

Co-Dependency - high (game is full of mindless screwage that can eliminate a player from contention in the first 15 minutes)

Summary - Game is remarkable in that it combines the worst traits of Euros (i.e., random and meaningless) with the worst traits of AmeriTrash (metagaming and player elimination).  Not even close to worthy of GMT.

Of the 200+ titles I have played, this is one of only two that I cannot foresee myself replaying under any circumstance.

If you wish to play a race game, then wait for publication of Jim Keenan's infinitely superior horse racing game, "Bloodlines."

Wow.  Maybe the best racing game I've ever played.  Very unique game centered around group movement in the pack and managing your hand of cards.  A bit of a Euro at its heart and not at all similar to something like Formula D.  It does feel like a race though as you push through a pack or break out with a cluster of cars.  Exhilirating.

RATING: 7
I don't get to play racing games as often as I would like, but I like them. You really need to cooperate with other race teams to be successful, so there are lots of subtle moves to make. 

Also, you can be very aggressive and rub other cars out of draft lanes, etc. I like that you can determine the order of which cars you move. It makes less sense thematically, but does provide more interesting timing decisions. 

I am not a fan of the events (the tie resolution is just plain dumb and the luck is overwhelming), but I like the flags in the early stages of the race - I'd like a variant where there are no flags for the last lap. Getting a yellow then would just negate so much of the work positioning yourself. But I do like the yellows in early laps, since it creates additional risk/reward decisions about when to pit. Overall, a very solid race game. As in all race games, if it were up to me, there would be a timer on each move.

RATING: 4
Abstract take on Nascar racing. There is a lot of luck in the small hand of manoeuvre and event cards and there's more than a little room for screwage and kingmaking.

Probably my favorite car racing game that I have played. I like the card play in the game the most. I do, however, wish I had more choices with the card play. The luck of the draw seemed to make a impact on people. The whole game felt chaotic, and maybe that's what racing is, but the game felt fun if in the mood. I was in last place, then I was in first place, then a event card targeted me at random. With all of that, The game was better than I thought it would be and was visually appealing.

Honestly, I don't get what people see in this game. I felt helpless the entire time and no amount of planning would help, since the board pretty much is completely different by the time it is your turn again. We played with 5 players and it took 3 hours to play 3 laps around the track. I only gave it a four, because I'm willing to give it another try, but something tells me, it won't be much better.

On three plays and growing. A great racing game. Yes still has some luck but it really is about mitigating the luck you get. Blocking and forcing your opponents to help you is the key to winning this game, not grouping up in your own little line and requiring yourself to carry yourself (it may work for one turn and then ruin everything the next)

I don't like this game at all. Admittedly, I don't care that much for racing games in general, but of the three "real" racing games I have played somewhat recently (not counting Lewis & Clark and Dog Royal, which don't feel like racing to me), Thunder Alley is the one I liked the least by very far. (The other two are "Mush! Mush!: Snow Tails 2" (which I rated 6.5) and Turfmaster (which I rated 5.5).)

The main reason is that Thunder Alley just seems much too random and luck-driven to me, particularly the event cards, particularly the many ones initiating a yellow flag restart. This very high level of randomness can still be fine for other (much shorter and simpler) games, but Thunder Alley is much too long (and also somewhat too complicated) for it in my opinion. See the first general preference about games in my profile. Yellow flag restarts may be a very realistic simulation of NASCAR, but it makes for a very bad and frustrating gaming mechanism in my opinion.
Particularly with many players, the randomness of the other (non event card) parts of the game is too high for my taste as well (for a game of this length), it just seems too chaotic. Which, again, may be realistic for stock car racing, but I don't want to play a (realistic) game about it then.

Another thing (rather minor in comparison) that bothered me is that the inner lanes of the track aren't shorter than the outer lanes in the curves. I didn't come across any other rule that references the curves, either (for instance regarding the need to slow down). In this case, I would have prefered more realism, some incentive to prefer the inner lanes in the curves.

I should add that I didn't read the rules myself, didn't see all the cards and don't know anything about stock car racing. But in any case, the game didn't prompt me to learn more about any of them. My guess is that being an avid stock car racing fan is almost a prerequisite for liking this game.

I'm a fan of racing games due to the excitement they tend to elicit. This one is exciting as well as strategic, and despite a few glitches I think it's the best racing game I've played. Unfortunately there are a few people in my regular group that veto it every time it gets mentioned and so we rarely get to play it.

Stock car racing with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation. Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3–6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team.
Reviewer quote:  I prefer Race Formula-90 by a large margin. I also enjoy the Detroit games and leave Formula-D and Grand Prix/Thunder Alley to the kids.

A car race powered by a card draft. 
Of course there´s a little more into it, as some cards allow you to take advantages of some race situations, however, the general feeling is beeing in front of a chaotic game. Is possible that, with some practice, a player learn to somehow better coordinate his cars, taking more fun out of the game. 
Anyway, at least for me, this game does not go much more further in the games ranking list.

Apesar de não ter quase nenhuma estratégia (a principal seria 'mantenha seus carros agrupados'), o jogo possui tantas opções táticas que chegam a fritar o cérebro. 
Uma excelente mecânica de movimentação que mantém a corrida com constantes ultrapassagens e um baixíssimo 'downtime'. 

Apesar do deck de eventos ser metade composto de bandeiras amarelas (o que pode frustrar jogadores profissionais) e o jogo não possuir miniaturas, é um jogo desafiador, divertido e capaz de agradar tanto jogadores casuais quanto veteranos.

Lots of strategy in this one, much more than I anticipated.  A really fun game where no-one is really out of the race until they retire or their car gets thrashed.  

2p game, triangle track.  I was crushing my opponent, 2 green flags, then at the end of the third turn, my engine exploded fit my lead car, bringing a yellow flag restart and grouping everyone up again.  I ended up winning despite my opponent placing first and second overall.

2p really short track. Drafting is the name of the game here, get a group of your card together and whiz around the track, I won handily because i used a car with three permanent damage to break up dressing groups of my opponent. I used this car as a demolition debt type car.

Third game also 2p with the bottleneck course.  Lessons learned, always out on yellow, played with the optional pit rules and liked these more.

I am amazed at the strategy involved this game, and even how it changes from track to track.  I preordered the track pack and am interested in how grand prix will be different.  My favorite race game.

4th and 5th games on May 17th 2015.  Both fun races (Spain and Ohio).  We decided to do a season and test some variant rules.

RATING: 8
Rated as a NASCAR fan. Kind of a spiritual successor to the Top Race system, minus the betting and with the addition of car damage and pit stops. It captures the feel of a real race as much as any game I've played.

The movement rules are a little tricky at first, but come together quickly.

The only real flaw in this game is the fact that some turns involve moving a chain of seven or eight cars, which can take a while. We talked about inventing some kind of magnetic gadget that would facilitate moving a bunch of cars at once, but we're nutty that way. :) I would love to get the play time down to 60-90 minutes; I think the game would hit the table a lot if we can manage that. Of course, a 15-car Thunder Alley race is much quicker than a 10-car Formula De race.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a couple plays, feelings are generally positive. There's some tough decision making with regards to which car to activate, how to move it, and when to pit. You also have a bit of a "temporary alliance" thing going on with the other players, which can add some drama.

However, it's pretty clear from my own experience that the game is best with 4-5 players, and I think most of the community agrees. With 2-3, there's not enough tension and it becomes too chess-like. With 6-7 it becomes too chaotic and too difficult to do any meaningful planning.

Update: I'm not sure about the crew chief expansion. On the one hand, it's nice to have a guaranteed action. On the other hand, I felt it drained some tension out of the game. Overall I guess I'm take it or leave it.

This is a very solid NASCAR racing simulation, but as game its not exactly my cup of tea.   I don't tend to enjoy long games (2 hrs) where you do the same thing each and every turn.   I also don't tend to enjoy long games (2 hrs) where you can be effectively eliminated right out of the gate, but then have two more hours of game to play.  With pack-based movement, that can definitely happen in this game.   I think I would prefer Um Reifenbreite (sp?) or even something as mindless as Ave Ceasar if I'm going to drive around in circles.

I've only played this game solo - once with five teams of four drivers and once with seven teams of three drivers. I know I made mistakes and I'll eventually learn the strategy to this game, but so far just two games into my experience, I love it. You can see how each track will have its own identity and how the cards work is brilliant. 

I can't wait until I find a few people who want to give this game a whirl. I already find myself wanting to buy some poster board so I can make up my own tracks for the game. And I'm already trying to figure out ways to grade actual NASCAR drivers with the driving, the damage and the pits. 

I just purchased the expansion track set. I get the feeling I'm going to get addicted.

I love race games. I like Thunder Alley...BUT (and this is a big BUT) I was taken aback by one of the game mechanics. 

The actual race is very good indeed. You play cards which move whole sections of cars, so you need to get your car in a position to benefit from mass lines of cars moving simultaneously. All good and all very neat and clever. 

But then you draw an ‘event’ card, around a third of which give a yellow flag restart. So there we were all racing along and had got into three packs of cars, and it is true that there was no chance of a catch-up for the second pack of cars, and the stragglers in the third pack were about to be eliminated. And there was about just under half the race to go.......

And then came a yellow flag restart. With this all the cars are bunched up and the race started again (the laps are not reset, you carry on where you left off). The plus side of this was that the cars which had no chance in pack 2 and 3 were now in with a shot. The bad part was that it was as if the first half of the game was redundant and pointless (other than giving out a few leader tokens). It is a rather extreme catch-up mechanic where you all start from scratch! I know the front cars start at the front of the new line-up but that is a marginal advantage compared to the position they were in prior to the yellow flag.

Then just before the finish line this happened again and we all lined up again. And so almost the whole game had been rendered almost meaningless and it was whoever had the right cards in the last two turns. I found this really odd.

I know nothing about car racing but apparently this is what happens in US car racing but I am not sure that I like it in a game. Simulation over gameplay perhaps? It is certainly the most extreme catch-up mechanism I have ever witnessed! The event cards also had random cars crashing which seemed...well, very random!

In future I will probably play without the event cards as the actual movement mechanics of the game are very interesting and rather clever.

I am a fan of racing.  Always have been.  I've always (and continue to) turned to video games to get my racing fix because it's real-time and there's nothing sweeter than the roar of an engine at high revs, even if it's a digital fake engine.

So how do you translate such a high-thrill motorsport into a board game format?  For decades, it's been popular to put dice to the table and have at it (Formula D, Das Motorsportspiel), but Thunder Alley takes a different approach and makes racing a tactical affair, which I absolutely love.

Any racing fan who appreciates NASCAR knows that racing isn't just about going fast and turning left and even on road courses or open-wheeled racing, all forms of motorsport share similar basic principles of tactics and overall race strategy.  Thunder Alley, while lacking in an official NASCAR license, captures an aspect of this by simulating drafting and encourages players to make tactical decisions about how to best utilize the draft line.  Don't know what that is?  Well, the short of it is that if you get enough cars running together in a line, they collectively reduce the drag of air resistance, allowing the cars to move faster and burn less fuel.  Got it?  Good.

With that in mind, Thunder Alley attempts to capture the tactical-side of stock car racing via the use of cards instead of dice.  In typical racing games, you are assigned a single car, roll dice to move, and hope not to wipe out in corners.  In contrast, Thunder Alley has you managing a team of cars (depending on the number of players), something that is more common in open-wheels than in stock car racing, but we'll gloss over that side of it.  What this means is that while it's still important to cross the finish line first, it is vital that you also maintain the positions of the rest of your cars on the track as well.  Each of your cars' collective points for a race are added up and the overall highest among [i]teams[/i] is the winner.  For example, one of your cars could take the prized 1st-place, but if you ignored the rest of your guys, the players who secured 2nd-5th might outscore you overall.  From a hand of cards, you will choose any of your unactivated cars on the track and use a card to move it.  As stated above, the key to this game is managing the draft line - choosing a car to move isn't (often) about singling out that one car and moving it - instead, the card is going to dictate whether or not the rest of the pack is going to move with you.

If you play cards to work with the draft line, you will move more efficiently, having to spend fewer points to make your way down the track; conversely, playing a card that benefits fewer people might give you a boost at the cost of wearing out your car and potentially putting it into a bad spot later on.  Like real stock car racing, it's all about managing what you can do and timing it just right for the best effect.  Your decisions ultimately hinge on which cars you're going to activate first and what type of movement you want them to take.  Planning out your moves in advance is folly, however, as the manipulation of the draft line(s) often means that your cars won't be where you thought they would be by the time it comes around to your turn again.

Thus, the only real hit is luck of the draw - it's hard to be a purely tactical racer when you all draw from the common deck.  You may often find occasion where the type of move you want to do simply isn't in your hand because you got a crappy draw, but things don't go perfectly in real racing, either, so you gotta make do.

This is a fantastic racing game and one that really captures the spirit of stock car racing.  While it doesn't focus on apexes or speed as racing games typically do, it instead focuses on tactical positioning and using other race teams on the field to your benefit.  Also worthy of mention are how it handles pitting and yellow flags - each round of moves, for example, represents several laps around the track and the minor changes in position that occur within; therefore while no pace cars are to be found, yellows have everyone lining up again behind the pole and pitting on green has you drop to the apron and move back a few spaces.  It's a wonderful abstraction of the minutiae of racing.  Play this game, even if you aren't a racing fan!

RATING: 6
Rating of 6 based on one play.  I really like the drafting and movement mechanics.  There were two things I think can be improved.  1. I wish I had a hand size of one or two more cards to increase my hand management; the next time I play I will try playing with one or two more cards. 2. I could deal with the small hand size, but the biggest thing that annoys me about the game is the events.  They are very random.  If it's an event that affects everyone equally, fine.  But the ones that don't are very frustrating.  ESPECIALLY the resets.  A reset basically nullifies all plays made before it.  It hurts people that were doing well and helps people doing poorly for no reason.  Having a reset about 7-10 spaces away from the finish line, like we had, is just not good.  It's an artificial way of making the race close, but it just makes the game random.  This may be realistic in NASCAR racing, but I want to play a game where the choices players make are impactful.  The next time I play, I will try playing without events.

2015-09-08 : Dozens of misprints that I highly suspect are just there because GMT hit the "print" button before the game was properly playtested. A real disgrace and a black mark on their reputation.
The worse thing is that even with all the errata this remains a highly random, long, fiddly, no-strategy and no brains required Ameritrash racing game. 
Everything in this game is totally random : the cards you get, where other players will take your cars, what the turn-event will be - there's simply no planning ahead - you must wait for the player before you to finish his turn before you can take a look at the situation on the board and then pick the card that seems the most tactically advantageous at that point in time.
Formula Dé and Snow Tails are far superior racing games compared to this one.

RATING: 7
Much more interesting than I expected. I'm generally not a racing game fan (though I have fond memories of Win, Place, or Show). I thought this would be another insipid luckfest. But instead, there are real choices here as to how to move your team. You have a team of cars and will score for all of them so it's not about just getting the first car over the finish line; it's about having all your cars score well enough (Hey, maybe that's obvious to you but I know nothing of car racing).

The game is based on playing cards from your hand each round. You activate one car per turn with one of your cards and only one car per round (hand of cards). The cards can move a whole damn line of cars (even with yours still at the back) or push some or pull some. Temporary emergent alliances soon form with people helping each other until one of them makes that dick move and pulls away without bringing the others. But that's what you need to do. 

The other aspect that is not obvious at least to a non-NASCAR person such as myself is when to pit your car. Those cards you play cause damage on your cars. Pretty soon, your movement points are reduced unless you pit and remove the damage. When to pit each of your cars can have a huge effect on the situation. During the race, some cars will get left way, way behind or even lapped. But pitting at the right time will bring them right back up to the pack in a “get out of jail free card” kind of way.

So the ostensible fun is playing movement cards to buddy up until you're in the right spot where you drop all allegiances and make your move while managing to pit at the right time (or not at all). There is luck in the game in which cards you get as you only have a hand of N+1 each turn (where N is the number of your cars). So you only have one extra choice, and some cards are situationally superior to others. Moreover, it’s very hard to control or predict turn order and this will have a huge bearing, naturally, on which cars get to move first. 

Nonetheless, I found enough player agency and interesting decisions to make this a game worth considering on game nights.

RATING: 7
It was OK but it's more of a sim than a game. As a sim, it's very good, as a game, I got screwed.

It's got a nice, simple, card mechanism and very simple track and movement rules. the pit stops are a lot less ominous than they first seem. But despite pages of rules, some bleedin obvious questions remained. And there are errata, on the board (with a correction slip) and on cards.

What it does right is mimic NASCAR, with the emphasis on getting your team cars into a train and working together. A card might lead (pull cars behind it), draft (pull cars in front and behind) or pursuit (push cars in front). So with three cars in a row, I can with the correct cards, push all three together three times (1x draft, 1x lead, 1x pursuit). With good timing, I can drop opponents from my train, or force them to push or pull me along. 

Cars pick up wear and must pitstop, but in this game that just means dropping to the curb and then pulling out again, not terrible at all.

The killer was in our game, I had worked 3 good cars into a strong lead. I was literally rounding the last bend, ready to take 1st 2nd and 3rd place and win handily on points. The final event card was a yellow flag, the cars ALL regroup, meaning my opponent totally caught up with me. With more cars, I was swept by and finished with 1 car in the top 5 and lost badly on points.

As a sim, that's fine. As a game, that's horrible.

I'll play it again, a better knowledge of the deck helps. I can make better decisions next race. But I was not amused.

*** Played it again. With a better understanding of the cards and tactics, I stormed it. Absolutely slaughtered my oppo. After 2 rounds, I had all but 1 car up in the lead in a train, all his were scattered back down the track in 1s or 2s. Later in the game, I had 4 cars in a huge half-lap lead, all his way way behind with no chance of catching me. Both times drew a yellow flag (we actually had three in the game), and the restart means he makes a massive catch up for doing nothing.

And yet again, the final restart hit just on the final turn of the race, and let him score more points than he oughta. But I finished 1st 2nd 3rd and picked up enough from lap leads to win on points.

As a game, I enjoyed it a lot more, once I knew the best way to optimise my hands. This time, I really only had one car fall off the back, but even then it got in front of his train and so my oppo pushed it along.

The 4 tracks, whilst all are ovalish, are actually significantly different. 

I've pushed my rating up from 6 to 7 and put it on my wishlist.

I've played "Thunder Alley" several times, and with one exception, everyone who played really liked it. They got "into" the racing theme and didn't worry about how efficient or reasonable the game mechanics were. 

That one exception? Some of the serious gamers who played it at a local con. They were generally not into racing and didn't enjoy the game as much due to various mechanics. I like games like TA because of the increased social interaction (i.e. "Trash Talk"), but if you want a serious game that rewards serious analysis and planning, this is not your game.

Thunder Alley is a very nice racing game from GMT. It's always a difficult thing to re-create the thrill of speed in racing in a board game- and I don't know if this game totally does it. That being said, it's gameplay is quite fast and I bet it gets faster after multiple plays. Everything works well and I enjoy the puzzle aspect of trying to get your cars in front when most of the cards also benefit your opponents in some way. However, the cards really do limit what you are able to do in the game, which makes this less than the medium-weight game I thought it was. Instead, your actions are reduced to only several choices, but there is enough interest generated in determining what to do with those choices. TA wasn't a game that totally grabbed me, but I think it's a nice game and works for people who don't even follow racing.

Very random. Uninteresting theme. No need to play this again. I'd rather watch real Nascar racing.

To be fair I played with 7 players, which seems to make it more random. I didn't really understand the rules, particularly about changing lanes, but I really expected the rules from a GMT game to be crap. OTOH I have no desire to learn the rules properly, as I do not need this game in my life.

Players race a team of cars, with each car getting to move only once per turn, so the skill is in making sure your moves also drag your other cars along, or even better, getting your opponents to drag your cards along.

Great game with a motor sport theme which I love.  This game has been delivered by a company doing big war-games and that really shows in the rules but they really re-transcript a Nascar race.  Using cards was a great idea and allow the game not becoming too complex.  I would really love if they would make a F1 version.

A solid and enjoyable racing game.  Using the whole team to make gains really makes the game full of strategic decisions without being soulless.  Random factors still happen and the luck of the draw can zing you, but smart play will almost always gain a win.  Very fun racing game.  My biggest issues were that we didn't really run the pitting rules right, and I think that would have made a big difference.  Definitely want to try it again.

Interesting racing mechanic with the drafting, pursuing, and lead cards. I really like how cars move. 
The strategic choices are, however, somewhat limited by the one extra handcard. The question is more so, which car do you move at what point.

What kind of kills it for me is the effect of the yellow flag cards. It can be very punishing even if you played the best possible way the round before. 
I really dislike these random events, you have essentially no recurse against, have such massive effect on the game. Also, the gametime is too long for what it is.

However, we played with 7 players. So, maybe the game is much better with fewer players, which might earn it an upgrade in the future.

Thunder Alley really captures it's theme.  While I'm not a stock car racing fan, I do like this game as a cool change of pace from my favorite racing game, Formula D.

I think the game shines as a 4 player game; 6 and 7 players is too chaotic and 2 players is too vanilla.  It is also important to play this is a series of games, rather than a single race to avoid a single bad situation from losing you the game.

includes tracks and crew chief expansions.

An amazing racing game and really solid game overall. The Horgers have a winner here. Nice blend of tight decisions with an unfolding narrative that keeps everyone in it to the end.

Two key things are that TA keeps everyone engaged even when it's not your turn because of the 'linking' mechanic AND the fact that controlling a team means that smart play can win the game even if you don't win the race. Brilliant!

A GMT Euro type game (no dice, cards only).  An interesting if simplified Nascar race game.  Not particularly my type of game, but will play now and again.  Didn't really feel like I had much control as it greatly depends on the cards you get and the events that are drawn.

Some players at my table were considering playing a season of this, but I do not think this is something I would be interested in doing, as one 90 minutes game was enough for me.

Good production value (it's a GMT!) with nice and sturdy tokens, cardboard cars, regular fair cards and a double sided mounted board!

Feels very thinky.. i prefer "Race! Formula 90". It's got handmanagment aswell, but only for one car.. so here you have this euroie puzzle you try to solve EVERY turn.. the diferent damage chits aren't different as are all the cars.. they sacrificed a lot of crunchy thematic bits to the Abstract/Euro god.

No way to individualize your car, just puzzling, puzzling & then some more.

My recommendations are to leave your analytical brain behind and just have a good time. I play this with my wife, daughter and other nonintense gamers. This game is the antithesis of a strategic game where you plan turns in advance. We laugh while playing this game more than any other game I own. This is not a deep game where you will analyze play afterwards. That said, it is a lot of fun. And when your car in the lead blows its engine because of a card draw, just laugh and move your next car.

A reasonable simulation of NASCAR racing in that it takes place on an oval circuit and makes heavy use of drafting, all very different from the European saloon car equivalent. Simple choices in low value cards that avoid damage and high value cards that make the damage permanent, but you can't afford too much permanent damage. The secret is to get your cars in a line and draft each other, but there's such a chaos element in the game that good play is overwhelmed.

Race simulation that is better than the other traditional race games I've played.  Uses 4 types of movement that frequently moves opponents cars with yours. Movement causes wear which affects your movement values and can eliminate your cars from the race.  Plays fast over 2 laps so it doesn't wear out it's welcome.  Although I enjoyed playing it, I don't know how often this can be pulled out before it gets tiresome and loses in ranking.

A relatively easy, fun, chaotic mess. It's difficult to make plans from turn to turn, but there is definitely both tactical and strategic considerations.

I would like to play a few more times before I pass any significant judgment. There is a lot of the game determined by yellow and green flags. I still haven't put together a good strategy for how to plan around them, but it feels like there is something there.

I'd like to try with a full table of seven as well. Thus far, I've only played with four and two. Two held up surprisingly well, and four was a lot of fun as well. If seven is still fun, this may replace Formula D for me.

Potentially a good game, I like the way you have to move other people's cars and position yourself in such a way as to maximise the amount other players move you etc. Unfortunately the event cards ruined it somewhat, it is totally unfair to target 1 specific car. We had several cards where one car got moved 10 spaces back which basically killed any chance of it doing well. As it usually got lapped and removed. Furthermore the point distribution for 1st  place felt wrong- 1st place was not worth significantly more than last.

I really wanted to like Thunder Alley, but it ultimately falls into the same trap as Formula D: too complex for what it is. It "solves" the player elimination issue by frequently moving the cars back together during a Caution - taking much of the point out of actually trying to stay at the front of the pack. It introduces random damage, just to keep things from being too strategic.

I could see this as perhaps a thirty-minute card game, but as a nearly two-hour event, it's a pass for me.

Initial Rating: 3.0 (September 2014)

My friends know that I heavily dislike racing games, however they assured me I would like Thunder Alley because it has almost no luck and was very strategic. I played it and found they were wrong. I really dislike the game and it has a lot of uncontrollable luck in it.

As I wrote before I hate the theme. Also dislike the small chits for the damaged parts. The game art is ok. Still I would have ignored all of these if the gameplay was any good, but for me it was very boring and slow With 5 players the downtime can be very high. 

In each turn, you have some cards in your hand and It isn’t very hard to decide which one you should use, so the decisions are kind of obvious. I found some of the cards to be very powerful and unbalanced (there are some cards that don’t have any penalties on them). All of this makes the game highly tactical not strategic. To add insult to injury, the event deck adds another layer of randomness to the mix. My friends say that there are a lot of uncontrollable luck on the races as well, that may be truth, but I hate this level of randomness on a game this long (much longer that the advertised 90 minutes, even with fast players). I feel luck will decide the winner most of the time as the game decisions aren’t hard to make.

Another dislike, the first payer each round is the one currently winning the race, that makes sense but the second player to play is the one who is seated next to the first player? That makes no thematic sense and it penalizes the 2nd player if he is seated right of the first player as he will play last. Also the winner of the race can still lose the game (which is decided by points), that makes no thematic sense either although I appreciate what they tried to do here.
 
Bottom line, I heavily dislike the game. It is a light tactical long game with low control (all negatives for me). I won’t ever buy it and I will oppose further plays of it. I feel the game is mostly decided by luck and the kindness of the other players as they can really hurt you.

GMT do a racing game? I watched this sit unloved on GMT's P500 list for years, thinking GMT do wargames only, but like many I was proven wrong.

This is a very original racing game in which you need to focus on how your team of cars (rather than just your single car as in most racing games) runs. The cards make the difference - I get it now, it's a card-driven racing game, and given GMT's excellent pedigree with card-driven wargames, it makes more sense.

I have played this with a full compliment and with two. I enjoyed both games but with a full complement the time between turns tended to drag. That being said it was almost everyone's first game and the rules where being explained over and over. In a two player game it's a lot quicker and if everyone knows how to play I can see it going quickly. I was ahead in both games at times but things can change very quickly (especially with more players), and the yellow fags can change everything!! Pit stopping is important but done reluctantly when your out in front. 
I really enjoy this game and trying to figure out your best or most efficient move. I enjoyed all the games I've played so far and would like to play it a few more times.

Yeeehaaaaw. Lives up to my expectations. Boards look fantastic and the typoes are very forgiveable. The cards look very GMT, so mainly functional, but not very evocative compared to the cover or the boards. Long game, but feels like a race.

With 7 players on the Super Speedway:

Longer (120min) and much lighter than I expected, Thunder Alley is extremely tactical. Board position swings wildly from player to player as your cars can piggy-back and be bumped off line ala Robo Rally. Hand management is present though this is somewhat undermined by the chaotic board play. Essentially an exercise in turn optimization with a good dose of hope that other players will help more than hurt you; however, as you have no idea what actions others will take (cards are secret) your guess is less than educated. 

You would think such a game would be a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants wild ride; however, the game seems to trick players into thinking they have control and thus they spend a great deal of time reassessing and analyzing their board positions and card options each turn. This is quite surprising for a game with such little control and depth.

I was bored playing this game.  Perhaps it was the group, not the game.  It really needs people to play there cards quickly to keep it moving, but this didn't happen for me.
I also had to keep asking about how far my car could move because no crib sheets came with the board.  This was since the cars had different movement for different types of maneuver (draft, etc)  This meant planning my next play was impossible and slowed the game.  If you buy this game, print out some crib sheets!
Also I felt the game needed someone to moderate as the game needed to be tracked for lapping etc.
On the plus side this game really played like a NASCAR race, it just wasn't very streamlined.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Long and chaotic is a difficult combination that usually works for experience games. Thunder Alley can work as an experience for fans of race games. It also can work as a tactical game if players accept that a whole two hour-game can be turned upside down on a single yellow flag card turned up (or not turned up) in the last round.

With the right group it can even be fun with 6 or 7 players but it's better with much more control in a game with 4 or possibly 5 players.

RATING: 9
A pretty impressive achievement in terms of both gameplay and presentation (GMT 2014 edition). The team aspect to the racing makes this different than many other racing-themed games and adds an element of strategy, and the fact that cars can (and often do) move on other players' turns adds an element of interactivity often missing from games with one player/one racer.

The game is about positioning your cars in the best place at the best time. However, it is really not about that... It is a chaotic player driven game, where a player can unintenionally do so much damage to other player. And to complete, even if you perform well during all the race the ending have a lot of potencial for kingmaking, defined by the player who plays last.

Fun game.  A strategic race game where you're essentially the manager of a team of drivers during a race.  So this game doesn't give you the feel of being an individual driver racing to be first.  It's all about using the cards your dealt (various types of car movements) to move each individual car from your team using drafting and maneuvering techniques while managing damage levels both temporary and permanent.  Now that I know the different car movements (there aren't that many different ones) I wonder whether this might become more a matter of managing the cards Luck has given you to maneuver cardboard chits around a board.  But so far this is a fun game and is on my buy list.

RATING: 7
Some fun to be sure.  But the comparison to Race Formula 90 is obvious, as we played them close to each other.  I like what Formula 90 seeks to do better.  

Thunder Alley does a nice job of simulating the racing within a big field of cars.  But the very random card draws and very random race events were not ideal.  Also the endgame was too much, and when I saw people pitting to complete the last lap even after there was a race winner, really broke the theme.

Thunder Alley is lighter than it first seems - in fact it's light to the point where you can lose a game just due to bad luck.

Tricky to rate.

The main game is good. Enjoy the card play and the positioning.

The yellow cards can make the whole exercise futile. I know they are 'realistic' but I would happily drop them from the game/

Also, the random effects (eg "Pile Up!") would be fun enough in a short/light game and suit the 'theme' but really hurt the 'game'

After playing some more - rating dropped as it takes too long for the amount of randomness. The first 3/4 of the race seems pointless, simply avoid (as best you can) any permanent damage, stay in the pack, wait for the yellow flag & hope to draw some nice cards for the final sprint to the flag.

It's a shame as the basic card play is pretty good... but for a racing game it is too slow & dull.

Neat game that tries to mimic actual NASCAR. In the game you play a team of race cars trying to win a race. During each phase, players take turn playing cards to move their cars (and other cars) forward and each card has different effects. Some push cars in front of you, some pull cars from behind you and other cards have your car drive solo. They can also damage your car temporarily or permanently. Depending on the number of players, the game can last an hour and a half up to 3.

The game delivered. However my opponents didn't grasp the idea of negotiations in a car race and one reaction was pretty bad. The green player decided that he didn't want anything to do it costing him 4 points and handing yellow 4 points. So a difference of 8 between them and when the race was finished. 7 points was the difference between them.

If more reactions like that occur, I think I should go looking for multiplayer solitaire games. 
The yellow player has a terrific short memory as I brought two cars of him and one of mine back in the race.

I won with 160 points to 151 to 144 to a very low and distant fourth player.

the three of them agreed that future plays would see scoring much closer and because of that random victories would occur.
I couldn't disagree more.
Infact if the yellow player doesn't set his differences aside .i can see us fighting over third spot when the other are well ahead.

I dunno, I kinda like this game, and it does have more depth than you'd think. But last time, I blew up the engine of one car in the very first turn, before even the first corner. Knowing you have no chance of winning before the game even has had the chance to start? Nope.

El juego de carreras más vibrante que he probado, ágil, sencillo y rápido (el desarrollo, porque una partida a 7 se puede ir a las 3,5 horas). Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, aunque a los fans del control puede no gustarles, es bastante azaroso y muy caótico a veces. Una bandera amarilla en mal momento o una mala mano de cartas puede arruinar tu carrera, como en la vida misma :)

RATING: 8
This game really brings out the feel of NASCAR racing in many ways: running out to a huge lead to see a yellow caution flag bring everyone back together, a wreck here or there, damage and wear and tear, bumping cars to sneak into draft lines, etc...  There's a lot to like in this one as you manage a team of cars and a hand of cards to hopefully move your cars to the front.  Even the agony of pushing your luck on pit stops is in play, particularly as the game enters its final stages.  

This game is largely tactical as the board can change dramatically between your turns but you still need to keep a plan in mind using the cards in hand.  You also have to be okay leaving a car or two behind in the dust as you keep hold of the bigger picture (unless you get fortunate with a yellow caution flag or a clean air card...).  The opportunity to bump cars and exit draft lines creating gaps both create interesting situations to exploit.  

The selection choice of four different race tracks is also interesting as each of them race quite differently.  If you play the short track, prepare to see quite a few cars get lapped.  The road track will see longer draft lines develop and a logjam around the single lane corner.  

A couple words of caution: this game likely plays best with 3-4 players (although it works at other player counts, just not as well) and can sometimes feels like it takes 20-30 minutes too long if people are taking too long to think through their choices.  With only 4 players, one has a good size hand to play and enough cars to keep things interesting as well as short down time.

GMT Games look at simulating Nascar - to very good effect. In the only game we have played so far, we misinterpreted the yellow flag restarts, making the race much too short (and well organized, no one got lapped, or had to DNF due to damage)

A tactical race game, but I don't know why it hasn't the emotion of nascar racing. I think it is a bureaucratic game and the end of turn phase take out the player from the game immersion bringing him to boring adjusts, pit stops and worse... cards dealer.

RATING: 7
The pursuit, lead, and drafting of other cars makes for some really interesting strategic options in this game, and that you can only use one card per car means you have to scrutinize when is the best time to activate which card based on how your cars are positioned, along with the hand management of which action do I want to take at what time. I wish though that you couldn't take multiple damage of the same type, as that would be more thematic I feel and would increase hand management strategy by limiting what cards you could play. Also, while there are 4 different tracks the curves of the tracks only feel slightly different than the straight parts, leaving some variability to be desired. While the event cards do add some of this variability, they are really random and can be quite devastating.

Yet another game that I love, but am finding it hard to get others to play with me. I don't find it that complex but the weight is a little too heavy for the people I game with. Also, like myself, the people I play with are not NASCAR fans and have no background knowledge with racing.

There is so much I like about this game. With most games you can say, "this game is like ... but ...." I haven't been able to say that yet with this game (making it harder to teach). This could be because I don't play a lot of racing games but I'd like to think that it is because of the uniqueness of the movement and choices you have available.

I love race games and really want to like this. 

I have concerns about the amount of control any one player has over this game.  With no reaction cards to moves from other players and the limited hand size I feel a little at the mercy of the game. 

I am not sure that your choice of cards really matters you could almost top teck one of your cards and choose the car to use and do as well. 

Additionally, for a game that is supposed be simulate what the crew chief in a pit feels like, you spend a lot of time (and all the decisions) tactically moving the race cars. That feels odd to me. 

Lastly I think that they stripped too much out of this game trying to make it fast, and for me, whats left is a bit too simple. I believe Daytona 500 to be a better card management game, Stock Car Championship to be a better racing simulation, and Formula D to be a better press your luck game. This really is just one step above Monza for decision making. 

I will be looking into some house rules to make this more interesting.

Enjoyable, until the lapping mechanic got us horribly confused. Would like to play again, but with lap counters!

Initial rating of 8 after 3 plays, likely to go up.  Best racing game - better than speed circuit even.  Only played with 4 but all of have had a blast.  After more races this is a 9. Clearly the only racing game I need to own.

Captures the essence of NASCAR racing better than any game.  None are even close.  Played at quick pace with no re-dos gives a great feel of uncertainty in your choices as you race.  A very, very FUN game.  If you like your games more plodding and predictable, stay far away from this.  Unless!  You like racing and understand that it isn't all skill. Experience does count in this game as it is more than just tossing cards and hoping for the best. The tactics related to wear and pit timing often means more points for the savvy team owner.

A surprisingly fast and simple GMT game about a topic I don't usually care about at all.

What a truly marvellous game. I did feel, at first, that there were some over-simplifications but, having read Jeff Horger's reasoning, I can entirely see why many decisions were made. I do enjoy a good race game - like Race! Formula 90, Bolide, Speed Circuit and even Formula D; but, much as I like the genre, Thunder Alley is the first to really feel like a RACE!

The movement system is truly inspired and the fact that a sense of speed and dynamism is retained whilst keeping things simple is a sign of good design.

My two (slight) issues are with occasional poor card draws killing someone's race from the start, and the really rather ugly (if perfectly functional) artwork.

I do believe the Crew Chief will mitigate and even dispense with the first issue if the stretch goal is met. Crew Chief looks like an essential expansion.

My second issue is just how fugly the whole thing is, which is pretty much par-for-the-course with GMT. I know a lot of people like their graphics and design and to them I say: "Why?" Just because something is functional doesn't mean it can't be improved. Of course, GMT is a small company with small profit margins catering to a minority market. They perhaps can't afford good graphic design - or maybe they see the house style as a positive. I, however, don't think this is an excuse for a modern day games company. The Crew Chief expansion is one of the ugliest sets of cards I've seen. Even Monopoly tries harder these days.

I wish Jeff and NNG the best of luck with the Kickstarter, but I fear that it's not just the postage costs which are putting people off. I want to own this expansion, but man, it's an eyesore!

Like many, I'm pimping my copy with Racing Champions cars; but I'm also doing a graphic redesign for my own personal pleasure. It may not appeal to everyone, but it looks a hell of a lot better to me than the current production.

If ever GMT has the cash to publish a posh version of the game, properly designed. I'll gladly pay out for a second time.

Edit: I have been having fun with this solo, should get a real game played soon. I wanted to mention that there is some minor printing errata, including the dreaded 'board errata!'. The board errata amounts to a misprinted reference/ reminder chart regarding the types of movement. I have never even looked at it. I would in no way be put off of buying this game due to that.

Pros:

The movement system in this racing game is unique and fun. Most of the movement cards you play on your race car will also move some of your opponents' cars, so there's lots of strategy involved.

Cons:

The event deck adds a bit of spice to the game with random chaos but mostly it just screws with a player at the end of every turn. Also, some events are only mildly painful while others are way overpowered. The various tokens that you place on your player board are also pretty fiddly.

Before playing I disliked the theme & the visual style (which I still do), but I have to admit I found it fun to play. Sure, you're racing with cars, but basically it's a hand-management game with some luck, some chaos and lots of moving parts and pissing other players off. 

I'd have to play a few more games to really tell, whether there is something to be done strategically, other than timing your pit stops, or if you're just hoping to get the right cards at the right time. Also, for this same reason, it felt a bit long (with 5 players) considering how "light" it is.

Can't see it as a pure racing game, and I can't find any solid strategy in it. We played with 4 players 16 cars) and the game felt extremely chaotic. No matter what moves you try to do, when your turn comes again, you find your cars in much more different state, so you begin planning from scratch... and again... and again.
And the one time you finally do exactly what you though you would, an event will ruin everything. The game is very fun to play, only if you are prepared from the start for what you will face. Still prefer Formula D for more serious planning, even if it involves dice instead of cards, like this one.

RATING: 3
While I can see that this is a well-designed racing game, it really bored me. Most of that is because the theme doesn't really interest me at all. I thought this game would be much more exciting than it is. For me it's way too slow-paced and puzzle-y for what a racing game should be. Don't get me wrong, I think the drafting and movement rules are really neat, and maneuvering around other cars presents an interesting challenge, but the movement via cards with the damage feels really artificial to me. I would rather just play Hot Rod Creeps, because it really streamlines the whole drafting thing with a more approachable theme, IMO. I'm sure board gamers who enjoy Nascar will love this one though.

A couple of comments after a 5-player game. Thunder Alley was not a terrible game, but as a whole it fell flat. It was way too random for my liking. With 5-players, the situation on the board always changed completely before it was your turn again, so there was very little room for long-term strategy. Also, event cards were insanely powerful and could easily determine winners and losers. In Thunder Rally all you can do really is pick the best card at that moment and hope that other players and events don't mess up your game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A NASCAR simulation game where players race a team of cars against their opponent. Each round you play one card for each of your cars, allowing you to draft, pursuit, lead or solo movement. Most of the movement cards drag other cars along. Most cards have a cost, either a temporary or permanent damage token. When you accumulate three or more tokens, your car slows down. You can go into the pit to remove all temporary tokens. At the end of each round, there is a random event card.

The random event cards (a yellow flag type) typically reset the players into start positions again, undoing any good or bad moves you did.  It's a bit longer than what it should be. A 45 minute game would be more fun, but it will likely take longer than the 90 minutes printed on the box. It's a bit chaotic for my tastes, but it is a neat simulation, and some guys in my group really like this game. I'm not overly fond of resetting the board every few moves.  Worth a look if you are a NSACAR fan.

Race can take a little long and while a neat little game, I didn't care for the racing that much. Not my kind of game and it was a little swingy. Sometimes you just didn't have the right movement card based on something someone else did unexpectedly. I guess that's understandable, and the game gives some wiggle room, but its still not something I was crazy about.

Decent enough but way too light and chaotic given the fiddly rules and a few terrible presentation choices including crucial errata on the board itself. Won the game, but feel it was far more due to luck than any skillful play. I'd play again but doubt I'd bring it to the table myself. Honestly think it's way too overrated for what it is.

Early thoughts: Wow! This is one of the few racing games that has players actually racing. It also has one of my favorite mechs, line reordering. I am reminded of Galaxy Trucker, but in this game you are playing the event cards on the entire group. 

Presently this game is really pushing Formula D out the door. I don't see any reason to value to keeping both in a collection.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Compelling mechanisms and rules that imitate NASCAR racing: draft, pack movement, etc.

Event cards are very random, to the point of being game changers.

Important errata (GMT).

There's a nice degree of tactical decisions, but at the end of the day, you are at the whim of the other player's moves (they matter more tan your own moves).

Way too long (2 hours!) for such a random game. Would be a huge hit if it could be played in 30 minutes.

Gioco fantastico per via dell'ambientazione. Campionato Nascar dove contano le scie, bisogna stare incollati al paraurti davanti.

Preliminary rating after one play (3p).

In terms of game play, TA is a 100% tactical, medium weight Euro with easy rules. No strategy here, my friends, just tactics. Enough randomness to frustrate the optimizers among us. Also, some folks will certainly dislike balancing mechanisms such as the yellow flag events, I've read complaints about that specific aspect. For the sake of fun for the whole group, that element is really important, however. A runaway leader would probably turn the game into a boring experience. What also makes it feel Euro-ish is the lack of destructive options. You cannot provoke accidents, or sabotage your opponents. The interaction in form of secondary effects on opponents' cars is inevitable as long as the cars are stuck together, but it may turn into a solitary activity when the teams get separated from each other (one more game play related rationale for the yellow flags, by the way). 

Does it carry the theme? Yes, it does. I'm not sure if I would really call it a simulation... no, probably not. The level of abstraction is still too high. But it most definitely feels like the game started with the theme, so I would certainly say it's thematic. It does feel lika a car race, in a way.

...so, what it is in the end? A very thematic, tactical, medium weight Euro with limited interaction and a healthy dose of randomness. Hm... I wonder what our gaming theory enthusiasts would make of this irregularity of game design.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a tough one for me to talk about a year later. Obviously it didn't stand the test of time, but part of that was due to my wife and son really disliking the game (which really surprised me). I think the game length was the real deterrent and I also felt that it ran long for what it offered. With that said, I still think this was a really fun racing game with some great card play. My daughter loved this game, but we never played with 2, I thought the experience would be anti climactic since you're only racing one other person. 

I would still enjoy playing the occasional game and a buddy of mine has a copy so hopefully that would happen. Due to the length of the game I'd be happy to play Thunder Alley once or twice a year.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- You feel like you are racing a team of cars, this game is fun!
- This is an excellent family game, my kids love it.
- The rules are pretty straight forward and it is really easy to teach once you are comfortable with the rules.
- The card based play is great, it adds a different kind of strategy than dice would.
- The different types of movement really give you lots of options when deciding on which car to activate with which card.
- The damage tokens add tension to the game without being overly punishing.
- Really nice production, you get four race tracks in the box![/i]

This is the racing game I've been looking for! It's my favorite along with Formula De. Having a hand of cards allows you multiple choices on a turn but at times be luck of the draw (which I don't mind). Staying with the pack or working for your team, as you get to control multiple cars, is a new concept in racing games; at least for me. Knowing when to pit can be crucial to winning. I like that it's not always about who finishes first, as you can win by having your team finish in decent positions for an overall win.

Based on one play: I must say I really don't like these types of games. The main mechanics work well and are quite thematic. You must stay in pacts to get pushed or pulled by others and you get damage based on what cards you play. You also have a team of three and total points are what matter not just being the first through the finish line. However this is completely negated by the events that can just push you back 10 spaces, completely randomly, knocking you out of the race. Almost all events are back so just cross your fingers. Also, if the event is a yellow flag you all reset at the start line, so everything to that point is meaningless. That may be thematic but makes for a terrible game play.

RATING: 8
I was surprised how well this game scales, when there are less players, you have more cars each so there is still plenty of action. I think it better with 3 and up though, it is too easy for each player to fall into their own packs in two players. There is less room to do this with more players.

The core mechanics are pretty simple, so teaching the game is pretty easy and I've found that players catch on quickly. It's great fun to make temporary alliances and leave people behind with a fancy move. The tracks that come with the game change the game enough to make them interesting in their own ways, for example the short track can be brutal when it comes to lapping cars that have been left behind, where as the grove circuit is tight and makes you think about where you end your movements to ensure that you get pushed along by your opponents. I wish I could play this more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The mechanics are different from other racing games. I love the team dynamic. The race cards, card movement and event cards mimic the stock car racing environment very well. If you are not careful, one of your cars get out of the draft and loose the pack. It's really important to stay in contact, as your activated cars can be moved again in a draft line by other players. And then a yellow even can occur and all the cars are bunched up together! Nice touch.

After a few turns, the way the movement cards work gets pretty intuitive. I really want to play again, and with more players this time.

Wow. What an awesome game. I was a bit worried the tracks would all feel the same, but man do they play out differently. Each game has been exciting and the rules are rather easy to understand. Highly recommended. Plays well with all player counts including solo. I prefer it with 4-5 players, but I won't turn down a game.

Yellow flags are both the bane and savior of my existence. I can't wait to play this game more.

I do have a few complaints about this game though. One, the season mode of this game is severally lacking. I really think with a better season mode, this game would raise to a 10 for me. My other complaint which technically isn't game related is that it's very easy to kingmake in this game. Players that play more chaotically or just don't care can swing the game in a very unfavorable way. If you're not playing to win, you can really swing this race negatively. Nothing the designers could have done, but it is annoying playing with people like that.

I got into a game of this at my local board game meetup because I heard Tom Vasel raving about it on his video and that was why I suggested it. The game is a bit long for its weight and at four players it has become a very tactical game because forward planning is almost null because people will mess with your plans! I got hosed by the event deck and it was the last game of the day so I was a bit tired with the game. It is very thematic but it has it's problems. Today it just proved that my taste is very different to Mr. Vasel.

As for the theme since I don't know anything about Nescar, I don't think it drew me in with this one.

Two 6-player games. The game is almost just a 'party game', the luck factor is so high that final positions seem nearly random but there is laughter along the way. The rules are a bit more complex than a '1' but the play is very light so overall about a 2. This is not to say that playing poorly won't hurt you but playing well may not matter in the end. I'd advise any new players to NEVER pit under green. The diversity of 'damage' markers is wasted with only temporary/permanent being the essential difference. The Events dominate the game and the turn order rule is ridiculous.

Overall: Light fun that lasts a bit too long.

(PS: I came in 6th in our game, the 2 experienced players finished 1st & 2nd. In the 2nd game I was 1st overall with 1st, 3rd, & 4th and my son was 2nd with 5th, 6th, and 7th.)

RATING: 8
This isn't to everyone's tastes but I think it's among my top 10 games. I'm personally giving it a 8/10.

Overall, I'd say Thunder Alley is far more about tactics than strategy and is highly thematic. It's fairly random but still requires good judgement. There's a lot of tension and excitement (with the right players) and you'll constantly be jostling for race positions throughout the game.

It is also easy to teach and new players can get straight into it. I think it's more for adults as children might be alienated by the slightly abstract movement system (I can imagine them preferring a more basic and literal car game like Formula D).

Essentially the game consists of you deciding which of your cars to move next and which card you will use. The decisions have several layers. Do you prioritise your car that's at the front of the race or act immediately to 'save' one of your other cars that has fallen behind the pack? Can you trust other players enough to make temporary alliances with them to help each other? Do you delay pitstopping or do you pitstop now and hope a 'yellow flag' appears later that allows you to catch up? Will you play the 'sharp turn' card even though the resulting tyre damage risks a blow-out later?

Most cards make cars push/pull others along with them to simulate 'slipstreaming' effects, creating very satisfying jostling for good positions. Damage/crashes are slightly abstracted but it still feels satisfyingly like cars are grazing against each other.

Despite those tactics, this isn't a game where a really smart player will be able to harness their full potential. Playing well requires 'good judgement' but not much planning. You can usually fully consider your move only after you've seen what the previous player has done. This increases downtime and I've never had a 4-player game run as short as the advertised 90 minutes.

Random events are also frequent, which add to the highly thematic feel of the game but at the expense of making it less competitive - especially as many events involve 'yellow flags' which are a big catch-up mechanism. When event cards trigger, they often badly punish one car that has the most of a specified type of damage (tyre, engine, transmission, chassis etc). Players inflict that damage/stress on their cars according to what movement cards they've played on them, so it's easy to look around the table and see which cars have become candidates for horrible events because their players have pushed them too hard. That knowledge can influence which cards you decide to play on your own cars, as you don't want to leap ahead of your opponents in a particular damage type.

Thankfully the game has almost zero bookkeeping, despite all its cardboard counters. Literally the only fiddly thing in the game is having to move whole chains of cars at a time.

It plays very differently depending on the number of players. 2 or 3 player is quite calculated whereas high numbers (5-7) would be quite chaotic. I think about 4 players is best.

Apart from the downtime issue and the limited ability to plan, the only other negative is that some of the cards and rules have been errata'd. I ended up using coloured marker pens to add clarifications to some cards, which was a pain.

Fun car racing with teams of cars, with luck of cards and strategy of play.  A bit of a long game, however, with a full number of players - which you do want for the race element, however.  I enjoyed it and would play again, but it wouldn't get to the table as much as some, I fear.

I really like the card-driven system but this seems to lead to AP with many players. This should be a 60 minutes game but it usually lasted almost 2 hours.

"Thunder Alley“ ist ein an das NASCAR-Racing angelehntes Spiel um Autorennen. Jeder Spieler übernimmt allerdings nicht nur ein Auto, sondern steuert ein Team von bis zu sechs Rennwagen. So gewinnt auch nicht derjenige, der mit seinem Auto nach einer festgelegten Rundenzahl zuerst die Ziellinie passiert, sondern der Spieler, dessen Team insgesamt das beste Ergebnis einfährt. Gesteuert wird das Spiel von Karten, mit denen die Spieler pro Runde jedes ihrer Fahrzeuge einmal aktivieren und vorrücken lassen können. Dabei werden Bewegungstypen unterschieden: ein „Lead-Movement“ zieht alle Fahrzeuge, die sich direkt hinter dem bewegten Wagen befinden mit, ein „Draft-Movement“ bewegt sowohl die hinter dem aktiven Fahrzeug befindlichen wie auch die direkt vorausfahrenden Wagen mit usw. Neben der maximalen Bewegungsreichweite verzeichnen die meisten Karten einen entweder temporären (also durch Boxenstop behebbaren) oder permanenten Schaden, den der Spieler durch Marker auf seiner Team-Auslage festhält; Fahrzeuge mit mehr als drei Schäden dürfen ihre Bewegungsreichweite nicht mehr voll ausschöpfen und müssen entweder einen Boxenstop einlegen oder im schlimmsten Fall aus dem Rennen genommen werden. Am Ende jeder Spielrunde tritt ein Zufallsereignis ein, z.B. eine gelbe Fahne, die das Spiel unter Beibehaltung der aktuellen Fahrzeug-Reihenfolge quasi neu startet. Das Spiel erfordert ein hohes Maß an taktischer Flexibilität: Das Ausspielen der Karten muss den sich beständig ändernden Positionen und Konstellationen der Wagen angepasst werden. So wird es etwa immer wieder unumgänglich, gegnerische Fahrzeuge mitzubewegen, um eigene Wagen nicht isoliert hinterherfahren zu lassen. Hinzu treten die Erfordernisse der (bislang vier) verschiedenen Rennstrecken (eine Erweiterung ist für 2016 angekündigt) – lange Geraden können zum Vorpreschen oder Aufholen genutzt, Engstellen müssen berücksichtigt und ggf. blockiert werden. Regelkenntnisse vorausgesetzt, dauert ein solches Rennen zwischen zwei und drei Spielstunden.

Game has a couple of twists that differentiate it from your typical racing game.  The first is the drafting rules wherein a line of cars will move on the track rather than each car individually.  The second is that each player has a team of cars so is managing more than one "line" of cars at a time.  Add in damage, pits, and aggressive tactics and the cars flow like NASCAR around the track for an innovative racing system that deserves more attention.

Good racing game - I have mixed feelings about it, but definitely want to play more. I like that it feels very thematic, much more so than Formula D, but while it feels very strategic during the game, it's easily possible that the winner did not play particularly well, unlike my favorite racing game, Leader 1, where winning is almost wholly dependent on your strategic choices. 

I don't like the event cards that much - they just add a lot of randomness - I like how the green/yellow flags come out, providing strategy about whether to try to hold out to pit when a yellow comes out, but I wish the events were more strategic, like limiting your card play or movement choices or making certain damage counters not count or count double for a round.  

And I don't understand how the pursuit cards are thematic - you can push cars in front of you forward but somehow the cars behind you can't keep up?  It would make more sense to have Pursuit cards be a catch-up card where a cars that are behind other cars but not attached can get a boost, either bigger movements or  without a damage token.

Update: Lowered 7 -> 6.  The downtime between players with high player counts is very boring - there's nothing to think about or plan between turns and nothing to negotiate with to convince players to help pull your car along.  It's just doesn't feel like a racing game.  But I find that gamers that are not huge fans of racing games do enjoy this one more than some of my favorites, so there's that.  I'll take Leader 1 and Formula D over this one any day.

I'm trying very hard to figure out where I want to store this game on my shelf.  

When I first got it I put it in the wargame section so the box could rub shoulders with its GMT brethren.  Leaping Lemmings gave it a nod and let it know that outsiders are always welcome.

Then after my first play it seemed it belonged with my racing games, so it moved to the shelf on the other side of the room. The moody Italian drivers in Bolide didn't give it much attention, and the Formula D boys weren't impressed with its not-quite southern accent.  But there was a begrudging respect.

After several plays it worked its way down and to the right to sit with my grouping of simple-ruled, deep-thinking non-lucky euros, where it's been having long conversations with Caylus and Princes of Florence when it doesn't think I'm looking.  It nods its head and scratches its chin when one of the games there says something profound but not too remarkable.

Although the action on the board bears a truly remarkable resemblance to old fashioned NASCAR racing on a small track, its play is much more about thoughtful decision making and the careful management of limited resources.  The 6000rpm scream of a floored V-8 engine is completely absent.  There's nothing wrong with that at all -- brooding euros sell well and have a strong heritage and following.  But I think you need to come into this game with appropriate expectations.  This is about cold, calculating play to optimize an overall point scoring result, not a desperate struggle to drag your overstressed car over the line first.  There's no one driving donuts in the infield at the end of this game.

Every once in a while you can pull off a spectacular move that's very satisfying. Fun and unexpected things can happen. There are always interesting decisions to make. Scores should be reasonably close and at the end you don't really care who won because the journey was the real highlight.

Ameritrash take on a racing game where players use a hand of cards to determine how their Nascar cars move along the circuit. Usual elements such as drafting, breaking away etc abound. Event cards (ugh) play a part in introducing potentially game changing elements such as rain (stops the race entirely). Cars get damage tokens across the game and with longer races, a pitting strategy comes into play.

Mounted boards are decent and there are 4 tracks in the box but the rest of the production reflects GMTs status as a war game publisher: loads of dull-looking but perfectly functional chits.

OK game at the end of the day but there are better race games out there. I'd pick Formula De and Rallyman over this any day.

I've made the PnP version and am totally sold on the mechanics of this game. Crowding a car next to you to shove him out of position; leading a string of cars through the pack to get to the front; crowding the car in front of you so he, in turn, crowds the car in front of him. It all feels very much like the racing my husband watches and it's loads of fun.

Spoilt for choice with great racing games at the moment. 
Rallyman, Race formula 90 and now Thunder alley. All 3 represent different disciplines and I can't pick a winner between them. This one is quick to set up and plays great between 2-7 players. Turns are quick and your cars can be moved when it's not your turn. Players can make and break alliances making this a great table experience.

First play with a large group of players so the game seemed to suffer with pace. Doesn't seem to be much choice regarding the cards you use and I can't decide if the random events help the game or are just there to artificially nullify any progress in the game. Would play again if nothing else is on offer and maybe with less players.

WOW. Like Daytona 500 and Formula D had a child. This game is GREAT. While being a NASCAR fan is not a necessity, it certainly helps the understanding of some of the "strange" rules. Don't get too caught up in the strategy of it though, the situation is CONSTANTLY changing and the event cards can really put a kink in your plans.

The game plays up to 7 but I really think that any more than 4 would be pretty terrible.

I'm not certain right now, but it may just replace Formula D...maybe.

A really nice abstraction of nascar racing. I could get people that hate racing to play and love it so that's a sign of a great design.

Best when played for fun with people who aren't too hung up on who wins. Can feel pretty random at times, both because of card draws and because of the behavior of other players between your turns. But that strange interaction of everyone moving everyone else's cars all over the board also provides a nice sense of chaotic fun. 

Based on the weight of the game, I do wish it ran a little shorter, and I might rate it a point higher if it did. It's still an excellent choice for a light-hearted group, especially if your struggling to find games that play 6 or 7 players.

RATING: 8
Really captures the feel of the sport (and I'm not even remotely a fan of auto racing) with some great mechanics (sorry, bad pun there). Smooth play and more than enough strategy to keep all the players fully engaged throughout.

Very little downtime between turns as it's really interesting what other cars are doing, plus they might be moving your cars as well. Brilliant!

This is a truly excellent multi-player game that is fairly easy to learn, but rather difficult to master. The one tricky part is to understand that draft lines don't exist for Draft and Pursuit movement until once the car get linked moving forward (so you can move laterally before a Draft or Pursuit move, even if cars are in front of or behind you - this can be key to understanding successful tactics).

Lots of satisfying moments, this is a pure fun game with an excellent narrative.

A great production from GMT.

Great mechanic in that in your own turn it seems going at it alone is better as working together, however if more people do work together you'll be leaving those lone dogs left and right as you race past. Captures very well the flow of racing which is a team and not a solo car experience. Good map, excellent player aid but bit fiddly because of all the card counters (but it being a GMT game game, this is probably what you can expect). 

Why rate this game so low then? Having permanent damage can take one of your cars out of the game ending any chance of winning. And this is done by simply the luck of the draw. You draw this event? You're dead. 

The fact that this crucial fact was not explained didn't help much either, but it resulted in the game being boring because if you can't win a race, why go through the process of repeating the same turn over and over again for three tedious laps? Add in a bit of king-making in the last turn and you see where this game can fail.

I say CAN, because if you know of the permanent damage mechanic and you know how to play around it, the game keeps being involving until the end and the last turn basically decides it. However, don't find it engaging enough to play for three full laps only to have everything decided in that last turn, which is often the fact with race games.

Recommended if you dig the theme, like race games and can root midgame on cars being ahead. Not a game for me.

This is a very, very good racing game, and captures the spirit of the genre of this particular brand of racing almost perfectly, while still being very fun to play.  The sheer amount of variety in the box you buy is also extremely good value for the cost. 

The tactical movement of the cars via the cards you have, plus the long term strategic planning (should I pit, or not, maybe try to hold out for the next yellow, etc.) is very thematic.

I am a fan of racing games (but not of racing... go figure) and this one is a winner.

I like the card play, but the game may be too chaotic for me. I don't mind the randomness of the movement card draw, but the events are uneven in effect and can totally change the game despite skilled play. Also, game tactics can completely change based on what other players do. The more players, the worse it gets.

RATING: 8
This is a difficult game for me to rate. Personally, I think it's brilliant. However, whenever I play the game, other people are much less impressed. So if I can't get a game to the table, do I knock off points?

The drafting rules make this game something special. You have to work together both with your own cars as well as those of the other players. The key is knowing when to stay with the pack and when to break away. Using the pack to your advantage, once internalized as the normal way of playing the game, keeps the game moving at a brisk pace. Combine that with the way in which you need to manage wear to your team of cars and you have what amounts to an elaborate exercise in both push-your-luck (to avoid damage) and brinkmanship (how long can you wait before launching a successful breakaway?) that feels exciting and true to its thematic core.

Admittedly, the game, with all its chits and cards, can feel a bit fiddly. Likewise, the strategy is unintuitive on first play. I've noticed that new players don't like to move other people's cars, even if it means dragging their own along for the ride -- for free! Instead, people tend to move just one or two of their own cars, avoiding the teamwork aspects of play as they apply across all players. Yet the teamwork movement is the heart of the game. To avoid it is to avoid the game itself. That said, how do I convince others of this?

Finally, my real complaint is play-time. Initial plays with new players regularly clock in at two hours or so -- but that could be shortened by reducing the number of laps required to finish the race. Two hours (including teaching time) is too long for this game for what it is. The good news is that long play times are only an issue, for the most part, with new players. After repeat plays, that time drops, especially once everyone learns to embrace the drafting rules to their full potential. Experienced players can move through a race in 60 minutes. This is unfortunate, though, because new players get the wrong impression about the game. My solution: reduce the number of laps by 1-2 when playing with new players. I think I will make this standard procedure when teaching Thunder Alley from now on.

Overall, I'm torn. Personally, I find the game to be a lot of fun. And yet getting other people to understand its unintuitive strategies is keeping the game on the shelf. What to do? What to do?

Thunder Road is another racing simulation that doesn't bring much new to the genre.  The stock car tie-in yields cards intended for drafting and spectacular solo plays, but they're tough to use and most of the game is spent managing the track congestion rather than breaking away.

Quite thematic euro that abstracts the right things to make the game feel more arcade than simulation but still retain that NASCAR feel.  Card play is very fun.  Are the yellow flag restarts too chaotic for their own good?  Possibly.

The almost completely indistinguishable shading between the valid and invalid restart lanes is an unfortunate production error, at least on my buddy's copy (first printing).  I don't know how widespread the problem is.  Not that big a deal, though.

First Impression:
Well if someone told me that a game of Nascar (that race with the all same cars going in circles) would be very chaotic I'd be sceptical at the least. Yet this implementation of the race is exactly that - total chaos.

The main mechanics appear decent and are certainly fun. Allocating your cards to your drivers in order to optimise your movement while at the same time trying to "read" the others to leach some movement on their turns feels great. It also creates some great cheering and agony as the board changes all the time with the player actions. You really feel like you can play smart, make the difference and generally have an impact on the outcome.

But then you realise that no, you really don't. In the end, the chaos of the player actions is just overwhelming. And the game mechanics also encourage alliances. You lined up with an opponent? Form an (informal) alliance with them and by the time your oponents try to break your line or do the same, half your cars will lead the race. Alliances in a race game are an absurb concept to me. Finally, the scoring system is laughable. Not because it is unjust (though we can't really speak about justice in a race where cars finish at almost random places), but because it forces you to count for nor reason. The first position takes 40something points and the second 40something-2? Really? From all the thematic elements that Nascar could inspire this is one of the things that was chosen? To need a calculator in a race board game?

It's a fun game, don't take me wrong. It has agony and creates a good race story. However it really feels like they managed to make a game with modern - "euro" - mechanics that plays like a dedicated ameritrash. If you don't mind total chaos in a game (and I mean total - roborally has much less chaos than this), then you'll like this.

I'd played Formula D once before and really didn't care for it, largely I think because we played with way too many people and it took a super long time. And I seem to recall there was some wonkiness with people getting screwed with bad dice rolls which I didn't love.

So sitting down to play Thunder Alley with six, I didn't really have high expectations. I was anticipating some sort of dice game where the challenge would be managing probabilities and pushing your luck. Instead it turned out that the central focus of Thunder Alley is drafting. No, not card drafting (which I actually mistakenly thought they meant) but drafting in the racing sense. Which means that this is a game where you want to be part of the pack. And the game is all about how you jockey your way into packs, move up your position in packs, make sure you get included when the pack comes into a turn (or make sure you leave out your opponents in that turn) and getting as much mileage out of the pack drafting movements as possible. And there's a fair bit of backstabbing as players can break the pack leaving a player/s behind, or push another pack ahead, leaving someone else's pack in the dust.

I like the game mechanics a lot. You have a small hand of cards, one plus the number of cars you control, and you have to manage which card to play for each car and how to time when you activate each car. That and the constant scrabble to get your cars in position and ding other players makes for some interesting decisions. The game isn't just about getting a single car into first place... you want to have the best combined position overall. You get points based on how all your cards perform. Largely you get an extra point for every place up in rank you score... but there's a bump for first and there's one or two extra points for being in the lead. So you really want to have a couple of cars place well rather than have a single car way out in front. Oh, there's also a wear and tear element of the game that puts some constraints on how you want to play your cards, but largely wasn't a factor in my initial play.

I really enjoyed the theme on this game too. Thunder Alley succeeded where Formula D failed for me, because the gameplay actually felt like racing to me. The speedup/slowdown, push your luck stuff in Formula D just never felt like I was racing. But moving your car up in pack position and trying to draft other cars felt like something that would really happen in a race.

And there was a lot more player interaction here... where you really wanted to be in someone else's pack, or exclude someone else from your pack. It wasn't just about being in first place, so you really cared about all your cars.

 For as long as I’ve been playing boardgames, the champion of racing games has been Formula De. And I like it a bunch. However, I’ve hardly played it. It’s big, it’s super long, and there’s a lot of downtime. Thunder Alley is poised to take down the champion. It’s not only leaner and meaner, it also has more engaging play. Each player controls a team of cars, and the emphasis is on drafting and positioning instead of pure speed. It’s the opposite of a cooperative game, a parasitic one, where you’re trying to take advantage of what the other players are doing to help you out. It’s exciting and a lot of fun and I wish I’d played more of it last year.

apparently tehre are issues with yellow flag "restarts" occurring late in game.. .an unfortunate catchup that is anticlimactic.

Hopelessly based on luck of the card draws and distribution and the benevolence of your co-players.  

Rules handling pit stops for super speedways are ridiculous.  How does a car leaving the pits be placed in front of a car on the straightway when they are the same forward space.  Really a car doing 55 MPH out of the pits beats a car in position that doing 190 MPH plus down the straightway.  Go figure. Gave up completely on this game.  

Hopefully designer will make optional rules to give more realistic results for pit stops. I might come back

It may be misleading to call this negotiation based area control, but without constant communication with other players, there won't be much you can do to control the outcome of any race. My first play felt like a lot of random actions over which I had precious little control, but I certainly think a second play with the same group would yield vastly different results. The design is rather slick. Fewer yellow flag events would have allowed this to be more strategic, but one can always cut a few more from the event deck to improve the game. 

Update 12/11/2015: Diminished results every time I play. The game doesn't really offer much strategic play. This is exacerbated at higher player counts.

This is one of the best racing games out there. Focus is not on driving simulation but more on team managing. This is not the traditional racing game style but it feels very much like real racing. Real racing is driving, tactics and a little bit of long-term strategy that has to be flexible and changeable on the spot. This game captures the tactics and strategy part of car racing perfectly.

Comparison to other games:
Some games capture the feeling of driving simulation better, for example Speed Circuit is the "best racing game" that focuses on driving optimally and pushing the limits instead of team tactics. Other "racing games" are not racing games at all, for example Pitchcar, it's a chaotic dexterity game that has nothing to do with real racing and does not feel like it either. Thunder alley has a place on the market as it is a real racing game that models a new part of car-racing in an interesting and well designed way.

An ok, light, quick, racing game, but wildly overhyped:

A bit complex to teach/learn (not non-gamer family faire).

Fairly fiddly constantly having to move long rows of cars.

Quite chaotic as a single other player's move can completely drop your car out of contention, seemingly with little you can do to prevent this and to catch up when it happens.

Quite a bit of downtime as each player's turn may move lots of cars, completely changing your options so only limited planning between your turns.

I am happy to play it again, occasionally, as an alternative to Ave Caesar and Top Race / Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix (and always instead of Formula De), but it is definitely off my buy-list.

For the real deal racing game with strategic depth (and complexity; certainly not a game for everybody) - really, what you would have expected a racing game from GMT to be - checkout Race! Formula 90.

-----

Thunder Alley is for you:

if you think racing is watching lots of cars whizz around a race track;

and if you do not mind massive downtime as there is very little to do between your turns;

and if you do not mind massive randomness (card draws, some of which are simply outright better and more useful than others, and event cards) and chaos.

Yes, you can play well or badly - it is mostly about positioning, but no matter how well you play you are still largely at the mercy of other players' moves which sometimes intentionally and often randomly screws you over.

Race! Formula 90 is for you:

if you understand that racing, especially Formula 1, is about both chosing the right strategy, tactics, positioning and managing and optimising the use of your resources;

and if you do not mind some "downtime" between your own turns although it is not really downtime as the are lots of things you can and should think about and plan between your turns and you will often feel you have too little time;

and if you do not mind some randomness (card draws, some of which are significantly better but balanced by also being much more resource costly, and calculated risk resolution).

You can certainly play well or badly, and that will almost entirely determine the winner or at least if you are in contention of winning, but a bit of good/bad luck can determine a close contest.


Thunder Alley is somewhat similar to Ave Caesar, Formula D and Top Race.

Race! Formula 90 is somewhat similar to Leader 1: Hell Of The North.


Thunder Alley is a light, arcade/action game and feels like watching a Great Crashes compilation DVD.

Race! Formula 90 is a deep, strategy game and really captures the essence of Formula 1 racing.


Thunder Alley is the racing game you would have expected from Steve Jackson Games.

Race! Formula 90 is the racing game you would have expected from GMT Games.

It is very difficult to make a good race game. You have to strike that delicate balance between the game feeling fast paced and it actually having interesting decisions. Thunder Alley, unfortunately, fails on both accounts (not unlike many other race games that have come before it). It comes off as a "let's see what happens" game but doesn't move along or end quickly enough to justify that level of chaos and lack of decision-making. Just the thought of playing Thunder Alley fills me with dread of being bored.

This has become the goto racing game at my house. The easiest comparison is to Formula De, another long time favorite of mine, but the comparison is not entirely fair. Thunder Alley is more strategic, less luck dependent, (although there is some luck in the card draw and event deck) and far more interactive, all of which make it the better game. Despite these traits however, it still remains a rather simple game once you understand the different movement modes.

In an odd way, Thunder Alley reminds me of Panamax. Mostly because the goal of game is not to move your own pieces to their goal, but rather to force your opponents to move your stuff for you. Often times your team of cars will move further from your opponent's card plays than your own. It's an intriguing puzzle and makes every card play an interesting one.

There's no denying that controlling a team of cars jockeying for position is more interesting than piloting a single one, like you do in Formula De. That being said, I don't think Thunder Alley necessarily replaces that classic racing game. The reason is that while Thunder Alley is more interesting, Formula De is more fun. I guess it's the push-your-luck aspect of the turns and gear dice, but Formula De just feels more dangerous, which in turn makes it more exciting. 

So what's the verdict?

Own both. Thunder Alley is a tremendous game, so even if it isn't technically as exciting as Formula De, it's incredibly rewarding as a game experience. Getting your whole team of cars to cross the finish line in the front half of the pack makes you feel like a genius, even if it lacks the glory of taking a two stop Formula De turn in fifth gear. I wonder if you can play Thunder Alley on a Formula De track? Hmmm...

Thunder Alley is a card-driven NASCAR-style racing game complete with four tracks (two double-sided mounted boards).  Each track has distinct features which offer up a very different racing experience.  Players take on the role of a team manager in charge of multiple cars (fewer players, more cars per team).  Every player's action can move other players' cars (hypothetically every car in the game can be moved with a single action) so there's a lot of movement involving one's cars even during other players' turns.  The card driven actions and events add a great deal of chaos and luck resulting in a very fluid game.  The game situation is so fluid that forward planning is often foiled.  It's not out of the question to go from first to last or last to first in one turn!

The concept of card-driven team racing that includes drafting is reminiscent of [thing=635][/thing] (another GMT product) by Reiner Kniza.  But Thunder Alley supercharges those concepts while adding many other concepts to make something quite original and addicting.  The components are top-notch and more visually pleasing in person than the images on BGG.  But what really sets Thunder Alley apart from other racing games I've tried is that the pace of the gameplay is quick (even with many players) which gives the feel of speed.  Finally, a racing game that feels fast.

I think this Nascar racing game of chained 'cause and effect' gameplay is best at 2 but I'd even allow for 3. Beyond that, there's not much of a game here because the overall game can be so drastically different that it's near impossible to get any sense of what you should do (for a good case).

RATING: 7
Seems thematic and yet enjoyable (unlike NASCAR), but runs a bit long. Definitely enjoy managing several cars instead of just one, as it makes for a vastly better game when you're not in or near the lead.

I suspect I'd like Grand Prix better just for the variety of tracks and a better sense of planning/maneuver.

Card driven, interactive, point-to-point movement race game. Play maneuver cards to lead, draft, pursue with special effects of which most will cause temporary damage to the car where you need to manage your pit stops. Event cards throw in the random conditions of racing. This is a fiddly game as many maneuver cards effect several adjacent car tokens as player teams race around the track. So, a lot of time is spent moving car tokens laterally, forward, and backward. I'm torn between it being fun and being fiddly. The trick of course is playing your maneuver cards each turn that give your team the best advantage relative to the positioning of all the cars on the track. This does lead to team negotiating which is good.

Not a bad racing game. However, I'm just not a racing game fan. The source material and artwork didn't do anything for me but I liked the team mechanic. I have not decided how I feel about the reset offered by a yellow flag. We found the movement rukes confusing after multiple read throughs.

A wickedly clean design. Thunder Alley does a solid job of representing the Real Deal, though it's probably best viewed as an experience game rather than a racing game. Crazy stuff happens, the game ends, and then players laughingly reflect on the wild turns of fortune. Sometimes only a small fraction of the game actually matters, thanks to yellow flags and arbitrary events.

If you're not a racing gamer, Thunder Alley won't do much to change your mind.  But if you are, you'll be happy that the game exists, despite the fact that the box is tall enough that it could be installed as the foundation for your pool's high diving board.

With four separate tracks and a 7-player maximum, the value for the money is certainly there. Though new players should start with fewer players and fewer laps.  A six-player, four-lap race isn't the best introduction to the game, since it will last upwards of three hours.  Four players and two laps is a good place to start.

One thing that's really nice about Thunder Alley is that it can be easily modified to suit the strategic tastes of the players, like so:

A bit more strategy: Flags are ignored on the last lap.

More strategy: Flags are ignored completely.

A lot more strategy: The event deck isn't used at all. No flags or events.

Pick your poison, and have fun!

[i]Update:[/i]

The general consensus in my gaming groups is that there are too many yellow flags in the event deck.

We will probably use a variant where 3-4 yellow flag cards are randomly removed from the event deck before the start of each game.

The mechanics are really brilliant ones, it is a pleasure to find ways to "push back" the other teams when you try to place a maximum of your cars in the front positions. I just can't wait to play more of this game.

Excellent stock-car racing feel that doesn't get down in the weeds of "simulation".  But it's not just an experience game, it's a good game in its own right with players needing to manage emerging and dissolving alliances to do well.  Definitely some luck, but also some good tactical and strategic decisions.

The rules are easy to learn and a couple of games are way sufficient to try and understand each move. That is one of the few games which do not require me to plunge into the rule book every now and then... at all!
The strategy elements are there all along a game and nothing can be taken for granted until the end. Pack racing is the base principle, altered by individual decisions to make a breakthrough and try and get some advantage. Cars rarely get isolated and even though it may be the case due to difficult cards, a yellow flag is due to come out and make a group restart mandatory.
Hand management implies maximising the effect of "good" cards in keeping you team up front. Depending on the circumstances, a card may be played as aggressive or defensive and there is almost no dead end in what the player is dealt. The game takes another dimension with three or more teams. With only two teams, it is only natural to try and form two lines and rush to the finish but fortunately yellow flag restart re-shuffle things a bit.
The game components are on par with recent GMT publications, with nice thick two sided boards. Graphic design is not ground breaking but does the job.

A game that's enjoyable even when losing. Card selection adds variability with control. The event cards can be very cruel and capricious, but you just have to know that going in and laugh when you're being screwed. With a full table and rules explanation, the playing time is 3 hours, not the 90 minutes listed.

Massive downtime, over-long and repetitive. There are some nice mechanisms concerning slip-streaming and the corners are interesting in the way you can join and leave packs of cars. I think if it was shorter and snappier it'd be worth playing. I'd rather play Flamme Rouge over this one though.

This is an very cool card driven racing game, that accurately simulates a lot of Nascar racing aspects, such as drafting, pushing, pursuits, under- and oversteering, etc.

Playing an entire racing season would be insanely fun, but then again I love any sport games that allow for league play.

What you need to know about the game: 

- It's not Formula D, it has no dices and you have a team of cars. It has more tactics than Formula D. 
- It's highly tactical. It's a joy to pull or push other cars and make deals to also see your car(s) pushed during other players turn. This is the core of the game.
There is a learning curve in this tactical play. 
- not very much strategy because there is too much luck in which cards you receive and if there will be a catch-up yellow flag 
- It's a very good simulation of a Nascar race
- It's good thematically
- The catch up mechanism with the yellow flags is both intense and frustrating

I think it's a good and enjoyable game, but also there could have been more strategy to it. Yet this would have added more AP to it. So for a racing game it gets a good rating from me.

GAME: Afrika: The Northern African Campaign, 1940-1942 (1st edition)
RANK: 3853
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Invited to play by a friend.

Desert campaign 1940-1942.

SCS system with low counter density and very fluid plot.
With the long time scope turns(1 Month), the high rates of movement and the weak ZOCs effects, this game seems weird. The Commonwealth player may establish a defence in Mersa Matruh or ElAlemain and even then, the clever Malletti can go for a quick ride to Cairo and Alexandria !!!!
The necessity of counting supply points, truck points and shipping points may seem an excellent simulation exercise for some people but for me only serves to complicate and weary the flow of the game (there are other desert games with more elegant and intuitive supply systems).
Players can let their units be killed by lack of supply to be later reconstructed with replacements points.
Basic and clumsy fog of war in which you can not see the units under the top counter (you can have high stacks of damage markers!).
Odd players disposition (Not F2F but side by side).
I have played SCS Ardennes in the past and enjoyed very much.  I can not say the same of this title.
Positive points for the system.

The North African campaign is one of my favorite subjects. Also I like the mechanics of the SCS series.

Poor supply rules. 
Given the time span of each turn, MA are very high and units fly on the map....

A fun, fast paced game with massive see saw battles throughout. The only problem is the British turtle defense which can ruin the game. Other than that a great game.

RATING: 9
Probably the best game in the SCSeries. I have played it several times and enjoyed it for its simplicity and yet realistic/historical play (going back and forth along the N.Africa coast). There are also several smaller scenarios for an evening play.

RATING: 5
Low counter densities and streamline game system make this a one of my favourite quick wargames.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

RATING: 6.5
Standard fare for the SCS, you can find better on North Africa. Fast and Furious to play, one of the few games where the early Italian invasion of Egypt get a fine treatment.
Buy if you find it on e-bay it comes usually cheap.

this was a lot more fun than I expected , the step reduction CRT is well done and I think I have finally found a wargame that I can use to hook my father into the hobby!Old skool hex and counters for the win now if only they made it with 5/8 or 1 inch counters.....

Fast, simple rules and low counter density make this move right along. Plenty of maneuver, but you always have to keep an eye on your logisitics!

Just received the second edition. Graphically, some things are better, some aren't.

RATING: 6
The first test of any North African campaign game is how it handles the supply rules. I like how you have supply points on the map which must be moved around by truck points. But then why oh why, make players jump through mental hoops with the rounding rule for supply which simulates...what exactly? I'm still game for other SCS games - the base system is sound and easy to play but they still remain 'try before buy'.

Looking forward to seeing this model of one of my favorite campaigns in action.The book "Panzer Battles" by Gen. von Mellenthin, shed new insight for me on this campaign from the German command side.

Played one of the short scenarios, and need more play time with it. Enjoyed it.

I really like the SCS system. Of the 3 games of SCS I have played, this was my least favorite. It is not a bad game as you can tell by my rating. I just like Ardennes and Stalingrad Pocket better. This was a back and forth affair, which is as it should be for N Africa.

Lots of manoeuvering that may become weird at some times. Enjoyable. The rules for Rommel turn him into an uncatchable war machine that can overrun twice and fight once in a turn, escaping capture quite easily.

A bizarre game where the supply system lets the Italians starve to death without combat.  The SCS has always had problems with overly mobile units and this was one of the worst.  (Of course this makes for great, exciting games, even if it's terrible history.)  One of the weaker North Africa games around.

Solid game in the SCS series.  Simulates the to and fro of the North African campaign well but suffers slightly from fiddlier than necessary supply calculations.

This is the game that got me back into wargaming.  Afrika is a solid, reasonable simulation in the low-medium complexity range.  There is lots of nice chrome for such a simple design.

My favourite game in the &quot;Standard Combat Series&quot;.  Easy rules (not as easy as your typical euro-game, but not a big step up, either), challenging (multiple stategies can be employed, but all have their achilles heel) and quite realistic for a relatively simple game - simple, but not simplistic.

Old-style paper chit wargame of Rommel in N Africa, but excellent logistics/oil mechanic, so it seesaws back and forth as offensives run out of supply, just as history.  Hung onto, but have not played since grad school.

I kickstarted the 1st edition of Gloomhaven but passed on Scythe and 7th Continent, which were all on KS at the same time. Big mistake. The latter two became two of my favorite games to be released in the last year, whereas Gloomhaven was my most disappointing game.

I can see why someone might like this game. I don’t understand how this is poised to become the new #1 game of BGG. 

I found it to be extremely fiddily. The cardboard terrain is double sided, so setup takes 30 minutes at least, at which point after hunting for each piece I had lost interest in playing. Every scenario we played felt the same, and after three plays of killing all cardboard bad guys I no longer wanted to play this game again and sold it.

RATING: 9
Extremely well designed game. All classes are fun to play, and seemingly well balanced. Missions often lead to "edge-of-your-seat" moments, where one or two cards can determine the difference between success or failure (or perhaps it is just my group that suck :)). Highly recommended!

Imagine if D&D's dungeon crawling and role-playing were swapped in quality.  You won't be haggling for a horse or purchasing rations, but the gameplay is so good!  Insane amounts of content, interactions that make each playthrough unique.

An absurd value for money.

RATING: 2
This game was a huge disappointment. I cannot understand the throngs of people who praise this game. Leaving aside the weird, NPC-type character races (your choices are quite limited up front) and the badly-organized box (its half-assed attempt to provide some sort of organizational structure for the myriad decks of cards is insulting), my problem with this game comes down to the opening scenario. To say it is brutally difficult is an understatement. It is downright impossible. Changing strategies, characters, skill/spell loadouts, all yielded fast, frustrating death, if not in the first room, soon upon entering the second room of three. Forget trying to meet the (randomly-generated and very, VERY odd character goals) for the scenario. You'll need to seriously ratchet down the difficulty, beyond what the game even allows, basically house-ruling a way to win the first scenario. IE, the only way to win that first scenario is to cheat. What a fun way to play a game. 
After running into loss after loss on the first scenario, I boxed this game up, sold it, shipped it, and never looked back. 
There is no reason for a game to punish players who have just started. It's bad game design. A well-designed game can teach as it goes, introducing players to the complexities of gameplay as it progresses. A dedicated gaming group will not tolerate a game that dishes out constant losses, no matter how good it might get later on. There will be the inevitable responses of "get gud," etc, but a game has to have a hook to draw gamers in. This has only disappointment and frustration at the outset. Gloomhaven is not a well-designed game, no matter what may come later on.

Games of the genre are always a bit of a task to set up and take down but other than that pure perfection. Very fun. Introduced it to a few friends that wouldnt normally play these kind of games but they were shocked and really enjoyed gloomhaven once they learned the mechanics which only took about a half hour to get it down.

Playing a friends copy at the moment, it's growing on me with every play the only bit i'm not liking at the moment is that you can see from the beginning where all the creatures are and you're way around the map, but this now seems to have been overcome by some of the files available here so i'm looking forward to playing my copy blind :)

RATING: 4
I just can't find the appeal of it having played D&D (or Pathfinder or World of Darkness or any number of games). It isn't that the game isn't fun, just that it is a comparatively constrained experience. For a single player game I think it is excellent but, as a multiplayer game, it really doesn't stand up to other table top RPGs

After opening the massive box and looking at the components and reading the rule book, I couldn't believe how excited I was to play. I rate it a 10 before I even played it. I can't get over the incredible amount of careful thought and care and creativity that went into this game. I am proud to be a backer. We have played through the first scenario and love it! I can't wait until the next game day when my son and daughter-n-law join us on our truly epic journey.

I feel terrible giving this game such a low rating, because it's clearly a game that a lot of thought & effort went into, and one that many people love. However, I found it painfully boring. It felt like grinding in an old dungeon crawling video game. The monsters are fairly similar to each other, the AI feels somewhat dull, and some characters feel quite disadvantaged for gaining loot (for example, if your character is fragile with  ranged attacks, you have to keep your distance from enemies, which means you never get the loot... a shame. I loved the premise of top and bottom actions, but I didn't find the cards as exciting as I hoped. It's a real masterwork of a dungeon crawling simulator, but at the end of the day, it just felt boring to me. I will not be continuing with the campaign; one of my friends will probably take over my character.

This is it people - the holy grail of dungeon crawls.  I just can't believe how good it is.  The exploration and evolution of opening the new content is exciting but the game underneath is rock solid, elegant, thematic, and FUN!  Once you get going it's quite straight forward and easy to remember the flow, and it's a blast to play.  About 2 hours for a game with 3 people.

The dungeon art is quite plain, and you need lots of storage solutions to speed setup (see the forums) but the game is so good I just don't care.

RATING: 8
I agree with the majority on this one: it is quite an amazing feat of a game. Essentially, it feels like a skirmish dungeon crawler, but it has this compelling story concept woven throughout - events, personal goals, battle goals, and of course, legacy unlocks. This plus the sheer audacity of size and scope - 90+ scenarios, over a dozen character classes, zoodles of monsters and items. It lacks a standard fantasy trope and substitutes great big dollops of glorious world building. Doubt I'll ever come near to completing it - but still, love it.

RATING: 7
As of this writing Gloomhaven has reached the number one spot here on Boardgamegeek. There sure are a lot of positive roleplaying vibes to the game and having the legacy mechanic introduced as character development is a nice touch. The rules basically allow for you to own the game and play the whole campaign with several different people without everyone having a need to commit to the game 100%. New/random players can just pick a new character at the level of the rest of the party which is good because the game is huge and there is so much to explore that it is unlikely that you can have the same people with you through the whole campaign. In a sense the initial impression made me think of the video game Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim because Gloomhaven has a similar sandbox feel to it. There is the main storyline but you are not tied to follow it since you may venture to all these side quests.
 
So, the story seems interesting enough although I am a bit worried that all these side quests draw too much attention from the main plot. But does Gloomhaven play well… Honestly, set up is a real pain and you have to make a serious effort just to have the components organised in any sensible manner. Game/battle mechanics are interesting if a tad awkward. Having a 90% deterministic battle mechanic makes clearing a dungeon to drag quite a bit as players can spend a considerable amount of time to min-max the damage input/output. You also have several card decks, monsters and influence tracks to manage. Personally I would have preferred to replace the combat modifier decks with dice just to make the decisions faster. Moreover having fewer but stronger monsters would have reduced the amount of micromanaging.
 
A lot of people like to compare Gloomhaven and Kingdom Death: Monster. Having tried them both, the initial impression is in favour of the latter. Gloomhaven is easier to get to play as there are no minis to assemble but the first few chapters of the narrative are not as engaging as is KD:M. In addition, the game mechanics in Gloomhaven force you to spend much more time on micromanaging the components and (sub)optimising instead of just following your instinct. But this is not to say Gloomhaven is a bad game. In contrary, I enjoy playing it and can hardly wait for the next session. But admittedly it is more of character development and exploration than of traditional board gaming. It just happens to utilise boardgame mechanics as means to deliver the experience. If you manage to see past the obvious shortcomings of Gloomhaven as a boardgame and embrace the story, I am sure the game has lots to offer.

Played the first scenario on Tabletop Simulator. We did a 3 player game and had a great time. The rulebook isn't great, some things were really ambiguous and we just guess some things the best we could. Overall, we had a lot of fun and I'm excited to see other scenarios, harder dungeons, and how well the world and characters actually evolve with the legacy mechanics.

A bit fiddly in parts (tracking monster health, etc) and a bit repetitive in terms of scenario goals ("kill all enemies") but this does nothing to diminish the absolute joy in playing this absorbing monolith of a 'game'.  Truly engaging, and deserving of all the accolades.  It's as much a gaming system as it is 'just' a game.

(No Spoilers)

This game has been an absolute smash hit with my gaming group.  It's everything we wanted, and more.

Cooperative games sometimes have trouble with getting the difficulty curve right, many times tuned to make it come down to the wire so much that winning or losing feels random.  The difficulty balance in Gloomhaven is top-notch, though!  It rewards clever play, and you can sail through a scenario on one or two well-orchestrated turns, or take a terrific beating if you just try to phone it in with hack n' slash tactics.  Plus, you can optionally tweak the suggested challenge up or down per scenario, and receive increased/decreased rewards as payment.  Fantastic!

Without talking about what they actually are, we're all extremely pleased with the unlockable classes.  You don't just get more of the same, and the variety of play that comes from the unlocks keeps the game fresh and exciting.  We all love our characters so much that we almost don't want to retire them, but the allure of a new discovery always wins.

This is my fourth 10-ranking, and Gloomhaven absolutely deserves it.  I never want it to end.

Incredibly complex game when you first try playing it but by Scenario 2 you're moving as everything follows video game "logic". Especially getting the game at the $99 KS price point, the game is worth every penny. I foresee years of game play out of the one campaign!

This game is very good!  There are many reviews out there describing the combat system, character unlocking, leveling up for characters and the city, and replayability.  I have a positive view of all these aspects of the game. For me, the only downsides to this game are the large amount of table space required to play, the amount of set up and tear down time, and my inability to get everything neatly back into the box after playing.  The box is already huge, but it still probably needed to be sturdier and larger because of component weight and the inability to put all items back into perfect cardboard sheet form.  This is the best dungeon crawler I have played.

Edit:  I purchased the Meeple Realty insert and now everything fits into the box very neatly.  The amount of table space has been cut down by the use of a fan made app controlling the monster decks.  Set up and teardown times between scenarios are still long, but are a perfect time for bathroom and snack breaks and conversation about how we were just able to pull out a victory in the last scenario.  

Edit: 23 Sep 2017:  There are so many scenarios and I usually have to play them more than once...once to meet the victory condition and another to try to get any treasure chests since I rarely have enough cards left to do both.   This is making it feel a bit grindy.  Even with this the game is still a blast.

Edit: 6 Dec 2017:  I still like this game, but I wish that leveling up made me feel more powerful.  A couple of hit points and one additional card option doesn't feel so significant.

The best co-op board game I've played hands down.  The world is fascinating, there is over 100 hours of gameplay for the campaign, and it's flexible to allow friends to join as they're available so you're not tied to the same group like in other legacy games.  Since opening it and logging over 40 hours, I still want to play this every day.

Arrived four months late on December 12, 2017 although was kept informed. 

Sizable as expected. Heavy. Initial visual inspection: contents should be rearranged in box as the spiral binding caused excessive warping of the box top. Flipping it over would've prevented that as well as preventing damage to back of the actual gameboard. 

Can't wait to play it! Super excited.

Not for me.  The key choices are which cards of your dwindling hand to play when and then which top/bottom pairing.  It didn't strike me.  Yes it's an interesting take on the dungeon crawl archetype and yes it has choices, but they never truly struck me as being tactical.  "I chose this pair because I was planning to do something... and my party member has blown up my plans.  So my play was for nothing.  Ugh."  I really didn't like the idea of making choices not only in the absence of enemy information (which I readily accept), but also in the absence of party members' information/plans.  It just didn't work for me.

by my current calculations, i have over 200 hours of play in a single box, and that's only a single playthrough and barely HALF the available characters!!

ONLY downside is this is basically the only main game ill play for over a year :)

RATING: 9.5
This game is ridiculous.  It is massive in scope, precision, theme, intensity.  Clearly, Isaac Childres has put his passion for this project over his interest in monetary gain because I cannot imagine that he has made money on this endeavor.  This game easily could have been released with a 10th of the content and it still would be worth the money.  Then the rest of the content could have been released a little at a time in the form of expansions ... like so many other games have done.  

This game is for you if you have lots of time to analyze card combinations and are into battles and tactics.  I think a good way to describe how this game is played is a cross between Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition, and Mage Knight.  You need space, time to set up, and a desire to play this through.  I have had the game now for a month and I have probably sunk 30+ hours into it and I am only about 8 scenarios into it.  You also need to leave the game set up somewhere.  It is a royal PIA to put it away and take it out again.  You also should play it solitaire or with a life partner if you want to see it to completion because it will be next to impossible to get a like minded group that can dedicate the time it will take to play this game from start to finish.

This game is not for you if you cannot do what I have said is required in the last paragraph and/or if you do not like Mage Knight or MTG.  D and D 4th edition was a poor iteration of D and D in my opinion, but the battles were intense and involved like they are here.

It's early days for me, but it's absolutely breathtaking: (i) all the nostalgia of D&D from around 1981,  (ii) the roomy feel of something designed at great scale with lots of options to rummage around in, and (iii) thoroughly enjoyable mechanisms in play, many original but similar in feel to those in my favourite games - you have to explore the possibilities of your deck as in Sentinels of the Multiverse, you have to learn the behaviour of individual enemies as in Assault on Doomrock, the operation of cards and tweakability of the deck is somewhat reminiscent of Mistfall or perhaps Mage Knight.  Not a 10 only because I think of 10s as final decisions, and you can't reach a final decision on something astonishing like this without a lot of play, or maybe even until it's done.  Maybe we'll become hungry for something different after repeated play, maybe this one sticks to your bones just as is, or maybe it keeps a steady diet of new tactical challenges coming your way.  At present it looks about as nourishing a game as you could hope for.

A great co-op dungeon crawler with a fantastic combat system and epic campaign, Gloomhaven offers an in depth experience that makes you want to keep coming back and play. 

With a co-op style that balances selfish acts and teamwork you will find yourself working with and sometimes against your friends as your progress through the scenarios and fight the bad guys. The  combat system also embodies the selfish and teamwork aspect forcing you to make hard decisions about what cards to use and when to use them.

The leveling and customization in Gloomhaven is full of options but forces you to make hard decisions about how you want to progress. This variety allows for you to be creative in how you craft your characters abilities and strengths. The designers have done a fantastic job of fine tuning the balance such that it never feels like you are overpowered but it also doesn't feel like your underpowered. 

The campaign is over 90 scenarios that you will unlock as you move through the game. Each offers unique challenges and can be set at a difficulty that works best for you and your friends. You will also at times face having to choose between two diverging paths that might close off some scenarios, making your decisions more impactful and leading to some hot debate with your friends about what direction you want to go in.

The game does require a good amount of patience as the rule book is not so well laid out. There are a myriad of small details that can have a large impact on combat and the game in general that missing them can have a negative effect on your gaming experience. I highly recommend watching instruction videos and taking your time when playing the first scenario so as to not miss out on all the important rules.

The set up time is also very long, making the overall game time longer than the 30-120 minutes. The box the game comes in is very sparse on organization so it is up to you on how you want to organize it. For cheep sake, I recommend sandwich bags or card slot holders as your do NOT want to just through the game into the box.

Gloomhaven is the first boardgame for me that has brought back the same level of excitement and adventure that I felt when I first started playing World of Warcraft. Exploring the world without knowing the outcome, spending countless hours connecting with my character and facing the frustration and gratification of epic combat makes Gloomhavenand epic addition to any boardgamers collection. I highly recommend it.

On the fence whether I should back this on kickstarter. Seems awesome, but will I tire of it before I get my money's worth?

Update: Decided I'm going to pass on the kickstarter surprisingly. I don't think I'll get it to the table enough for the price, despite its value for what it is. I can buy 2-3 other games that will hit the table more often for the same cost. Still interested but I really want to see some long-term reviews start to hit. I just dont know that it has the legs everyone thinks it does this early on. I'll let the dust settle and decide later. I'm certain this won't be my last chance.

A good game. Definitely a dungeon crawler. Combat is different enough to make the game stand out from other similar dungeon crawler, but game play itself is very similar to a majority of other dungeon crawlers that I already own. I will be willing to play this game and I plan to play it again, but there is nothing driving me to own it and play it over Descent, Mansions of Madness, Massive Darkness, or Warhammer Quest Silver Tower, I already own plenty of dungeon crawlers, if someone else that owns it wants to play I'm in, but there is nothing driving me to make this a must have, over the others.

Such a large system but so much fun. It seems very complex but with a little bit of patience you will see the depth and get a hang of all the systems and truly see the scale of what this game is.

I host my group, and fully intend to continue hosting the hell out of it. That being said, I employ a considerable number of outside systems/supplies to make tracking and organizing the campaign easier, and I would rank this game a 9 if I stuck with the game-supplied tokens for monster health, and didn't buy an organizer of 5th/6th player decks (I run a group of 6 people, no more than 5 in a single session, with difficulty increased for 5-player games).
Everyone in my group loves this, and with the assistance of Google Sheets and some skewing of everyone's first retirement goals so there are no duplicate classes, I think we have many, many more sessions of enjoyment with this game.

This is by far the best cooperative dungeon crawler RPG tabletop I've played.  There is a lot of player choice in how you utilize your abilities and how you develop your character.  Combat is a very active process and feels more realistic than other dungeon crawlers I've played.

The legacy elements are cool too and they'll never prevent you from playing the game forever if you want to.

2017 10x10. Great fun, the legacy elements are RPGish and sort of light, but add great flair and drive player desire and reward each session. Setup and fiddliness are off the charts, but it's a fun enough experience that it is tolerable. The scenarios feel fresh enough that though you end up sometimes in loops of using your cards in a certain manner, there is generally enough different that there is still good room for creativity, and the new cards you get for leveling up provide lots of different options. 

Leveling provides a true sense of escalation. E.g. my cragheart starts out kind of hybrid archery/melee, but you can decide if you want to focus on one or the other more, and then REALLY bring the pain and provide great CC and tanking later. It's really just a great experience, and a well earned spot in the top 5

Gloomhaven is yet another very big box of stuff.  It differs from, say, Conan in that the contents of the box are all about extended play value (90+ scenarios, character development and a legacy element) rather than the wow factor of massed plastic.

Gloomhaven is yet another dungeon crawler.  It differs from, say, Descent by not requiring someone to play the dungeon master.  I can see that in a game so strongly focused on character development, no one is going to want to miss out on that - even if only for one session - to represent the bad guys.  Gloomhaven tries hard with its non-player characters, giving different types their own decks of action cards.  Nonetheless, they too often do stupid things.

Gloomhaven is yet another dungeon crawler whose scenarios can take several hours to complete.  In this, it infringes my rule of dungeon crawlers, which is that if it takes more than an hour, then I'd rather be doing some proper role-playing that goes beyond killing things, grabbing loot and gaining experience.  

Characters' actions are driven by personal decks, with each card offering two different actions.  Each turn you choose two cards, selecting one top and one bottom action.  The optimum combination to use in a given situation is seldom available, so how to cobble together something effective? When best to use that one use ability?  Unlike many dungeon crawlers, Gloomhaven gives you plenty to think about.  

Production quality and artwork are both decent.

I'm not a huge fan of dungeon crawls, but this game is excellent.  The character card decks and the way you play them is very cleverly done.  The amount of material in the game in terms of both physical components and characters and scenarios is staggering.  Very much looking forward to the next play.

Playing with a group of 5. Sometimes the board is crowded and the bosses end up with tons of HP, but it's still so tight and finely balanced. Nearly every scenario is a taut tightrope walk.

RATING: 9.5
Wow. The card play is EXCELLENT. The branching storylines and RPGish campaign has me ready to keep playing every night. There is so much in this box. 

Love the art, love the storyline, love how unpredictable things are. There were a few choices (city/road events) where we all looked at each other and said "well, clearly the right answer is this one, right?" and then got the rug pulled out from under us. Love it.

If I had to give some negatives:
a) Some classes don't feel as fun as others - one player really didn't enjoy playing the Mindthief, for example.
b) setup is a bear, and the rule that you shouldn't know whats coming in a room is hard to reconcile with trying to set up the board ahead of time
c) first several missions are just variations on "kill the things." I'm looking forward to something with a different flavor.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Gloomhaven is among the most ambitious games I've ever played. A 90(plus!)-scenario campaign game featuring a ton of unlockable legacy content, this game has players selecting a starting class and building a hand of ability cards featuring both top and bottom actions. After some RPG elements of buying gear in town, completing choose-your-own-adventure style city and road events, and grooming your character for upcoming missions, players get into the meat of the game, which is a tactical skirmish dungeon crawl based around a savvy monster AI and very grueling (read: delicious) hand management. Objectives and plot progression vary between each mission, and success opens new locations, weapons, items, and even classes.  

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
To put it simply, [b]Gloomhaven is a cardboard MMORPG[/b]. Now, obviously, that sounds like a contradiction of terms, but bear with me. This is a game of [i]progression[/i] first and foremost. Basic characters gain experience and level up, adding new cards to their potential hands, buy items, and earn check-marks to unlock perks, manipulating their standard attack modifier deck. However, their ultimate goal is the completion of their personal goals. These goals are mostly very difficult, but unlock new legacy classes, side scenarios, and item designs as they are completed. Completing new missions opens new locations on the map and further progresses the game. Each player goes about their business, sending butterfly effects across not only the current scenario, but the entire game world. As the prosperity of the city of Gloomhaven increases, new characters are able to be created at higher levels--coming into the world fresh, but on the shoulders of world achievements and progression. The sense of expansion, exploration, discovery, and world-plot progression is off the charts. It's riveting. 

I should also mention that the majority of the game (actually playing the dungeon crawl) is really, really good. Monster AI works extremely well, the initiative system makes for tough, dynamic decisions, and the constant stamina timer of discarded and lost cards makes EVERY SINGLE TURN a pivotal decision point. It's a tremendous--TREMENDOUS--game, and a feat of hybrid (Ameritrash/Euro) design.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
The box is filled with twenty pounds of STUFF. It's all great stuff, and I'd not have it slimmed down (as it is actually pretty streamlined for what it is), but storage, setup, organization, and teardown are a bear. It's something that can be dramatically improved by better organization, but that's added cost. I really have no nitpicks about the gameplay, despite a few thematic quibbles which the designer has more or less left up to the players to decide upon as a group.

After 42 scenarios I found this game great. Each character has his own style and playability and can shine when played during the game. The event and the story I am seeing through the scenarios and cards are fascinating and impressive. The levelling of characters is very good especially when you start putting many new cards in the modifier deck. Only the time needed to finish the game is too long for me, but this is not a problem of the game but only that I play only one night per week and for few hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What a fantastic game! I love the tactical combat. Combine that with the legacy style world that opens up as you complete scenarios, and excellent leveling and goals system and the inability to play alpha gamer and this is fast becoming my favorite coop game. Plays great solo but a truly shines with a group of friends.

I tried to temper my expectations and not give in to the hype but... dang it's so good. We've been binge-playing Gloomhaven since we got our copy.

probably the best solo boardgame since mageknight
started with 2people party and will end up having roster of many characters.
each character plays very differently and rewards from treasure chest is quite fun and feel richer everytime
unlocking stuffs are quite engaging and encouraging me to keep playing this game
most frequently played boardgame in a given time period
monster behavior really adds complexity and uncertainty to the game and it makes player very engaged. 
leveling up and managing care pool and attack modifier deck are very fun
increasing gloomhaven level means more item to come
higher level items are very fun

Neat dungeon crawl game with a bit of a legacy game feel. Fairly simple to play but has some rules that require referring back to the book at times. Card play feels a lot like Mage Knight but far less irritating as you can play any card for a basic move/attack action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely love this game, all of the classes I've used so far (6/17) feel different from one another and the abilities they have feel thematic according to their class. 

Scenarios are difficult as most coops usually are but not impossible. (Playing on normal difficulty) It just takes careful consideration and planning. 

Road Events and City Events are interesting in that doing certain things will add other city/road events into the current deck to reflect the choices you've made. 

The only drawback I can see is that set up is a huge pain as there are so many pieces and bits. Storing all those bits and pieces is also not provided in the box but the game itself is great.

57 sessions in (46 unique scenarios):
Still going strong and so many of the new characters are really awesome.  Some of the "kill everything" missions are somewhat repetitive, but with new characters and party compositions, it is super super fun.  Just went through a scenario where 1/2 of the monsters are available on any given turn (phase in/out of existence).

27 sessions in (24 unqiue scenarios):
Upgraded to 10/10.  I can't stop thinking about this game and want to play it more and more.  Four characters are now retired and 5 unlocked characters (took 13, 22, 20, and 19 games to retire each character respectively). Depending on some of the goals, party make up, and other factors like which missions are available, there can be wide ranges in how long it takes to retire your character. There are lots of variations in terms of classes and different play styles and look forward to trying more!


14 sessions in (11 unique scenarios):
Playing with the lower variance version (2X and 0X treated as +0).  This is a game that I keep on thinking about.  Could I have played it different and what combos do I want to put into my deck for X type of threat vs. Y type of threat?

We have only unlocked envelope B and two side scenarios.  I can't wait until we unlock the Power of Enhancement and new classes (no one has retired yet).  

It plays extremely well with 3 and 4, but is a bit longer with 4, especially when there are lots of little monsters or NPC allies fighting with you.  With 3 you can get a scenario done in 1:30-2:00 fairly easily.  

Minor Issues: I wish there was a better way to mitigate some of the monster attack draws.  In one scenario we had 4 of monster X summon a monster Y each the turn they were revealed.  They then had the same action the very next turn and also proceeded to start healing them.  After the first batch, it was pretty much unwinnable and when we did it a second time we breezed through it.  

2 Sessions in:
Initially an 8, but strong potential to go up after more sessions. I've been itching to play it and thinking of all the strategies and card combos while not playing it.

Will be playing with the less randomness variation in the future as the 2X and null have a very large impact and prefer the more tactical approach.

What can I say. Our current favorite. But I am pretty sure this will last for a very very long time. It's the perfect combination of story telling, planning, tactical thinking and it's co-op! It is so worth the hype. Isaac Childres is such a generous designer: all this awesomeness coming in one big box instead of myriad of expensive expansions! That's just great! Now we need to find more time to play the rest of our collection which feels a little bit neglected. (Only downside is setting up is a part-time job. Best to just leave it on the table)

RATING: 10
First of all i dont give 10s easily. Its the 4th one, after Pandemic legacy, Cosmic encounter and Kemet. All for different reasons.

Why 10?
-Value for money. I am not sure this game provided any profit to Isaac himself. Seriously 100 euros for this 10 kgs box with the plethora of items it includes, its a joke.
-Its a legacy game, and its a legacy game that can be played again. Not sure if i ever make it to the end, but giving you the option to reset it seems great to me.
-Great battle system. Card combos are there but its very crucial to use them wisely and dont lose the cards early. Very smart. 
-The different characters do feel very different. Their playstyles are not similar with each other and feel very thematic.
-Absence of dice. 
-Its very close to Mage knight, except that it lasts 3 hours less. I love Mage knight too, dont mistake me, but Gloomhaven its more appealing with its shorter play time and legacy features implemented.
-The attention to detail in this game is amazing. Road and city events, personal quests etc etc , these stuff could be missing and still Gloomhaven would be great. But Isaac just wanted to make the best board game ever, and he probably achieved it.
-This board game comes as close and it gets to an rpg video game. I ve played many rpgs on the past and i can clearly see that.

*I dont think i can find any negative in this game. The only thing that  its a bit annoying is that all these components give me hard time settle them back in the box after finishing the game. 

*Its the biggest 10 of all ive given. The rest could be 9.. 9.5 this one is 10.

*Bought plano box for standees + additional box for map tiles.

*Painted minis

*Added painted furniture

*Bought health and xp dials.

*Bought removable stickers

Our group played Gloomhaven once a week for the first three months until one of our group moved to another state. Now we Skype once a month at least. When he retires a character we send him a new deck and model, he sends the other components back.

I've only played the intro scenario, so this is tricky to rate because I'm not leveling up, going to town, changing my deck, etc. As much as I'm inclined to bump it up because I'm sure I'd like those things, I'm really evaluating the core mechanics when I look at it through this lens, though, and the rest is sort of just the value of campaigns with friends and "loot," not much that has to do with the core game. And the core game, I think, is an uninspiringly standard crawl. The huge box and high price kinda surprise me too, given that it was just some cardboard and cards and a few unpainted minis.

RATING: 8
Gloomhaven's combat design is absolutely the best of its kind: it's simple to learn and hard to master, it's reasonably fast, and I've yet to see an ambiguous case to ever arise while playing, fiddliness is also minimal albeit setup and put down times are very long and demand a custom storage solution. 

The way combat moves have been "encoded" in a simple language of numbers and few symbols is genuinely an inspiring masterpiece. And while I may not agree with the rating because I think this game bargained its soul to the number crunching devil, I still think this is a must have title in any collection, and definitely a game worth playing at least a couple of times just to enjoy what a truly solid design feels like. 

Given the price it's a steal, there is a ton of content in the box, and while the quality of the components is not that good, its sheer ambition and scale makes up for it.

Christ what a fucking box this thing comes in!  This is the only board game I own where I literally have to remind myself to "lift with my legs" when I pick it up.

Anyway, a huge Dungeon Crawl experience.  I've had only middling experiences with Dungeon Crawls.  The Stories have never been that compelling and the tactical element has always felt really weak. 

So far GH has a really engaging story and compelling character progression and it doesn't even attempt to deliver a rich game of maneuver.  It trades most of that tactical stuff for more puzzle-type gameplay in it's card play which is really satisfying.

Initial Impression: In one word ... immersive. This is a massive, sprawling game that sucks you into it's world. The promise of character and world progression compel us to play this game repeatedly. The permanency of the legacy aspect can be easily mitigated with careful planning. I will say that this is one tough cooperative game. The races and characters play very differently with their individual decks, and have steep learning curves in order to optimize your performance in each scenario. And without that optimization, you will fail. In many ways, this game's cardplay reminds me of the hand management in MageKnight. The major difference though is that where I felt MageKight to be fairly abstract, this game is much more thematic. The game doesn't come across as a straight grind for progression. Instead, you're given many options as to how and where you'd like to adventure. For now my one reservation is knowing that at some point I'll have to retire the character that I'll have grown a deep attachment to. On the flipside, I know that it'll unlock another exciting character to explore.

RATING: 10
I have a copy from the first Kickstarter and have been playing the campaign at 2 players of and on for about 8 months now. It's an achievement. 

The card play is not simply a timing mechanism. The card play allows for interesting decisions as you work how best to solve each scenario's puzzle. Some scenarios require quick bursts of powerful cards, other scenarios require you to slowly play your cards over a greater number of rounds. Further, the card play and the resulting actions you take allow for interaction--both positive and negative--with your other players that help bring the table alive. The monsters bring interesting wrinkles and meeting a monster for the first time allows for the feeling of discovery even after 30 plays of the game. The boss fights add a welcome amount of variation in the scenario progression. There's just enough world-building that you do feel the world opening up as you progress through the story-line.

The classes are a well-designed collection of abilities and don't feel like your typical collection of warriors, rogues and sorcerers. Further, the leveling of the characters provides a really fun power curve. You begin very reliant on the luck of your modifier deck, but as you level, you get, among other things, more powerful cards and more control over the modifier deck. Your character becomes much more powerful and you feel a sense of ownership over how that power manifests itself in your character. The game scales with that additional power so no scenario feels too easy or too difficult. The scaling is not static, either, so you don't have to play with the same collection of characters or players in each session. 

The above-mentioned power curve and the character retirements are my favorite parts of the campaign. Each retirement opens up a new playable class and each retirement injects a sense of freshness into the campaign as you need to learn a new character and integrate it into the party.

There are some issues, but most of them are nit-picky or slightly cumbersome ways of injecting additional theme. For example, the nested definitions of the status effects are a mild annoyance (e.g., strengthen to advantage; muddle to disadvantage, etc.). The biggest gripe I have for the game play itself is that some retirement goals are very hard to achieve. Some players may be unable to retire a character for a long time. The game does provide a band-aid for this, since you can always just start a level 1 character from scratch and come back to that hard-to-retire character when the game state eases up on the retirement goal. 

One word of caution: you really need to spend time before playing the game to establish a system of organization. Without organizing the game, setup would be brutal. The second edition rule book and component upgrades will fix a number of issues I had with the first edition (some of which I avoided by using my own component substitutions).

Add-ons/custom components:
D20s to replace the damage counters;
standees to replace the 1st edition standees;
magnetic frame and markers to replace the 1st edition xp & health trackers;
foamcore card caddies for the various sets of cards;
tuck boxes for each monster type and other items; 
Plano boxes for the tiles; 
accordion file for the map tiles; and
reusable replacement stickers.

If you know and want what you're getting, you'll be thrilled.  The game is big, stressful, and interesting.  The value is, of course, huge.  I see two issues with the game.  The rulebook is very big and you'll need your own storage solution.  Normally, I'll dock part of a point because of issues like that, but this might be my favorite game of all time.  I'm not docking points for needing to use a Plano box, when this game has occupied all of my thoughts.

It's excellent.

This is everything I've ever wanted a dungeon crawl to be. I get to smash monsters, get loots, level up AND actually make meaningful, difficult decisions every step of the way. 10 rating once I figure out a way to store it in a way that makes any kind of sense. Even with planos for the chits and standees there is just too much. That's mostly a good thing but set up and tear down are really painful.

RATING: 3
Really not my cup of tea. I found it very repetitive and dry. Combat felt like a loooong slog whose charm wore thin quickly. I don't like the cardboard standees, which often feature artwork was so similar it makes the enemy units almost indistinguishable. The theme of the game doesn't permeate the mechanics or components (my glorious rat swarm is just a summoning circle token???) or gameplay. I know a great many people are enjoying the game, but I would advise you try the game before picking it up.

I love the story, decisions, lack of steering(mostly), and all other campaign elements.

The mechanics... are fiddly. I'm still in the rulebook, all the time, making sure I got things right. It's really a problem created by Issac's lack of compromising. Had he created a game that started out very simple, then scaled in complexity with expansions, it might have been easier to learn and grasp. But the sheer scale of everything that makes the game so epic is also exhausting for someone entering the world for the first time. We'll see if this changes as we continue to play through.

Update: After 10 plays, it's really starting to grow on us. The rules are starting to cement themselves in, and we're reading the rulebook less and less. Furthermore, we're really enjoying the differences in each scenario. While I don't care much for deck building, it's fun to look at a built map, read the objectives, then choose the optimal abilities for that particular scenario. I appreciate the modifier deck and how there is no die to roll and screw us over time and time again. Still not sure that it's the best game ever created, but it's become a perminate fixture on the table.

2nd Kickstarter printing.
Played 15 scenarios so far and it has been excellent.
Main cons are setup and repetition of "kill all" goals. However, I found the core gameplay to be very enjoyable and the feeling of constant (although slow) progression  keeps me getting back to the game every available weekend since I own it. City and road events help in creating the world and introduction and conclusion sections of each scenario give much more context than for example Imperial Assault did most of the time. Some lifegoals can be a bit of a grind while others unlock scenarios and thereby extend the narrative of the world.
Give it a try if you can (and you have time for slow but very satisfying progression).

Anything Legacy where you are asked to destroy physical components of a board game you bought just to "emulate" tension is a complete disaster. Boardgames need to be taken care off, not mutilated. If you really want long dynamic Campaign games, there are far better tools than putting stickers on boards and destroy things.

At it's core Gloomhaven is a campaign based, dungeon crawl, legacy, mostly cooperative, "RPG light" game.  It does what it sets out to do exceptionally well.  Gloomhaven is set in a fun and flavourful fantasy setting.  The narrative elements of the game help set a light but immersive tone.  The card driven movement/combat system offers interesting decisions (it is this system that truly sets it apart from other dungeon crawls I have played).  The volume of content is impressive.  The component quality is fair for the price of the game.

In my opinion, Gloomhaven is the best dungeon crawl board game I have played.

Imagine a mmorpg but it's not massively or online. and its on a board. basically a Board Utilizing Multiplayer RPG or BUM RPG (trademarked by me). It's cooperative until it's time to get the money and the treasure. Then it becomes every man/rock monster/rat-thing for themselves.
Recommend you get the organizer or else you will be spending the best years of your life packing and unpacking all the parts. 
Would not recommend to small children. incredibly complex, many choking hazards, and the sheer weight of the box will give them scoliosis.

An incredibly tactical dungeon crawling experience. While it doesn't follow the traditional role-playing approach, the character growth certainly follows what you'd get in many video game RPGs.

I really enjoy the combat mechanics, the dungeon crawling itself, the various environments, etc. I really don't have anything too negative to say. The scenarios are rather samey after a while, but the classes add a lot of variety. My biggest complaint is how darn fiddly the game is. Setup WILL take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, though scenarios after the first will go faster due to having the pieces out already. An organizer will really help with playing sequential scenarios.  

Finally, to top it off, you get potentially hundreds of hours of content for around $100. Huge value, quite the fantastic game.

Great game play. The desire to develop your character is high. Why is it not a 10? The aesthetics are weak (the minis are not great, I don't like the standees, and the dungeon graphics are bland). Getting the components out for newly encountered enemies is tedious. The table quickly looks like a mess (Descent is much stronger, visually...but then again I've painted all those minis).

Other observations:
Character effectiveness seems to vary greatly, or I am just way worse than my kids :)

10/17 Rio and I finally stalled out on this one mid way through the campaign. We spent a LOT of hours playing, but eventually it started to feel like work, and some of the characters are just less fun than others to play, or just not very effective without more characters to work off of. Bumping from 9 to 8.

My initial love for the game (which earned my highest ever rating of 9.8) has been crushed somewhat by the most recent Kickstarter, with its updated cards, character boards and rule/scenario books.

This is bitterly disappointing and I feel badly let down by the designer.

Incredible game! the production is just perfect, the components great. LOTS OF CONTENT! It's like a RPG videogame experience on boardgame (but a really good rpg). Simply the best dungeon crawler i ever played.

However to be fair, there are a couple of cons:
First, the game is a bit complex, the rules are extensive (but the manual is really good written), took a while to remember all the situations and the exceptions. Can be a bit overwhelming to new players, in fact the first explanation took us about 2 and a half hours.
Second, the game is quite difficult. It's a tactical game, that encourages you to not do metagame talk, to roleplay your character (i find that awesome), and this make things more enjoyable but makes the game more difficult (a lot more difficult). You will need several scenarios to get the class you picked, to know the cards and the synergy of your character.
Third, the random element can be frustrating on early game when you haven't upgraded your modifiers decks jet. There are no dice, and you can somewhat calculate the chances on what are you going to draw, but sometimes random is random and bad random, and you miss or die. But the game is fair, you need to learn to anticipate and administrate better your actions.

My rating will probably increase, but so far this game has been wonderful. It is huge and gives you the sense of an open world, RPG adventure. I really appreciate that the scenarios are very strategy focused (optimizing card play, positioning, turn order, etc.) instead of based on a handful of die rolls. This sets this game apart from other "dungeon crawl" games. Overall you have a lovingly produced, deep, complex, strategy game with legacy, character progression, and story depth. The designer took on one of the most ambitious projects possible and has delivered a fantastic game.

Having played many of the flagship dungeon crawlers available, I think this one outstrips them all. The story being little more than a vehicle to get you from point a to b might warrant less stars for some people (justifiably) but the quality of both the moment to moment gameplay and the emerging legacy aspects shine to brightly for it to tarnish the experience. With the most tactical, variable, and satisfying combat yet to grace a thematic american game, the time commitment is large but the skill ceiling is also high. As close to a perfect gaming experience as I've ever had.

(Need to learn how to use OCTGN.)  Also, I want to play Defenders of the Realm a few times to explore the different combination of heroes.*

*Need to buy some 'trays' from Daiso to hold the minions.


===========
I don't think I will be buying this since I have other games to occupy myself namely Machina Arcana, Eldritch Horror, Prophecy and Mistfall where the latter two I have yet to get much played.

The reasons I may not be buying this game is that it is heavily campaigned based and I don't think I can dedicate myself or find someone to spend time to through the series of scenarios in campaign context where you will have to bring the experience of your heroes to the next scenario.

The other reasons is that the game seems a little too fiddly for my taste with the revelation of the modifier, the infusion of elements and management of the element tracks, and the tracking of the health on monsters/enemies which may be felt difficult.

I wonder how will this game fare against Sword and Sorcery.

*It is always good to state the reason why you are not buying the game.

Gloomhaven is a beast of a game. Most co-op games are like puzzles that end up having one person in a group dictating what each players moves are. Gloomhaven erases this concept with the help of your personal cards and what you as a player plays. Every class is different and you must learn who you are to maximize the best outcome for your team. Sometimes that changes depending on what scenerio goal you pull, and your team mates might not exactly know what your plan is. You really do feel like you’re playing a video game. You really become attatched to your characters and your character really does have a personality based around a background you create and the cards you have. I highly recommend this game for anybody that likes fantasy and dungeon crawlers. Playing solo, however is not the best way to play this game. The challenge is the other people at the table. The puzzle is wondering what they will do, and when you go in a round that can completely change the plan you initially had. Top marks. This game will be played quite often.

OMG, was half expecting this to be the usual 'meh' kickstarter - needing development. Oh no, this is rock solid - an immersive coop which is really hard to quarterback, each player gets their own unique deck.

A grand game that is just too much to be worth while.   If it was scenario based and not campaign based, I may like it more.   Don't consider it a board game as much as an RPG which does not interest me.    Game like Robinson Crusoe, or Spirit Island are more board game to me.

RATING: 3
I wanted to like this game - the concept was cool, and who doesn't get excited over a big box of goodies? And there's some unique design elements here too. I would've rated this higher, but I wanted to make sure my opinion on the game, and additional plays have just made me hate it. Absolutely no desire to play ever again.

Gameplay is super slow. Takes several turns to kill even small mobs (bar good luck/burning a strong attack), and even the smallest, most forgettable dungeon is going to take 2+ hours. And heaven forbid you fail a mission, then that session feels like a complete waste of time, and you have to slog through the same crap again next play.

That's without mentioning the campaign itself, where progress is a crawl. How often are you playing this? Weekly? Get ready for it to take a month for you to gain any sort of benefit. And anywhere from 6-12 hours of gameplay. Playing an MMORPG here. And then when you do gain a benefit, it's what, one or two new items (with a limit on how many you can carry), one new skill? With 17 characters to cycle through, there's no way it needed progress this slow. It's a bummer, as the campaign largely feels tacked on, and frankly, I think GH plays better as a one-shot game. Just choose a scenario, the characters you want to use, and scale appropriately. Way more engaging.

The allure of campaigns, and many games in general, is the sense of progress they can give you. Gloomhaven's core gameplay is the opposite of this (starting with a hand of options that dwindles as time goes on) without giving players feedback that makes them feel like they're making progress. So that's what the campaign is for! But it's so slow-going, it just feels like a slog. Gloomhaven, more like Grindhaven.

But what's worse, as a game that's marketed as a Euro, the second coming of Mage Knight, etc, etc... is the luck factor is worse than most dice-driven games I've played, between its randomizer decks, unpredictable monster priority/movements, and chaos of co-ordination. (Though ultimately that co-ordination does give players agency and avoids quarterbacking to some degree - it would be fine by itself, but annoying with the other luck factors.) And in a game that's this tight, a bit of randomness can flip a scenario from a win to a loss.

The randomizer decks are hot garbage. A friend I was playing with couldn't stand them after 2 plays. When you roll dice, you can predict the results. With this, it's pretty much even chance you'll get good or bad luck. Completely random. If you get your critical/miss cards, the deck recycles, so it doesn't even accomplish the advantage of using cards over dice - that a slew of bad luck can be rectified by a slew of good luck.

And what's worse, is bad luck is just plain worse than good luck. The game incentivizes you to optimize and plan out your attacks. So when you get a -1 on your carefully planned attack, you'll not only have to waste turns trying to kill something, but probably be wasting resources taking a hit. +1, +2 or even a double attack? More often than not, it just uselessly overkills an enemy.

And then you have perks. What is the goddamn point, of having luck just so you can mitigate it as time goes on? Just don't have it in the first place! It's not a reward, it's an artificial design handicap to give players the illusion that they're making progress. Just lazy.

The gameplay can feel pretty limiting too. Quite often you'll look at your cards thinking "I want to do this, but I can't". I do generally prefer games that give you the ability to do what you want on a turn (with action points or something, so you still have to choose between what you want to do), but it does go a way into making characters feel distinct, and is a neat puzzle.

For more material things, it's also a chore to set up (though I was enjoying that more than the gameplay by the end), the component quality is iffy (though acceptable given the amount of stuff) and the board's utterly useless. Just track your progress on paper like a big girl (you have to for the individual characters anyway). Player envelopes are useless too, they just make it take longer to setup.

Oh, and whilst the art is pretty nice (admittedly not a high fantasy fan, but it's kinda unique even if it's just the same spin on regular fantasy tropes), the theme is dry as bones. Little sense of immersion here. You have some nice theming on character/enemies, but it largely feels mechanical.

I hope designers take a look at Gloomhaven's success and can pull it off better. Having your game require thought to play is a good thing, but bad when it doesn't reward you for it. Difficulty is compelling, but not when you have to redo a scenario when you lose. And there absolutely should be a priority on giving players gameplay content for the cost, rather than just bling.

For a campaign game that's punishing, but also gives you a good sense of progress and has a good mix of quick battle tactics and long form strategy over the course of several play sessions, look at Kingdom Death: Monster.

For a thinky dungeon crawl that rewards player skill, has a good sense of progress over a single session, and enables a ton of player agency, Mage Knight is uncontested.

The storytelling is really, really good. I love card management system and how every single character and every single scenario needs to be played differently. Played 20+ scenarios so far and can't stop enjoying it.

Update Feb 25, 2017
After playing the game several times I have come to appreciate the intricacies of the combat engine and the planning and decision that one has to make. Playing it co-op is a much better experience than playing it solo. Great game and I thus increase my rating.
Played one game and lost. Very very close game. The scenario came to who had the lowest initiative. My lasy standing hero had a slightly higher initiative and yhe baddie stoke first. I was learning the rules of discard vs losing cards. In other words, I messed up and was punished for my mistake and that is great stuff. I will play again tonight. So far I am enjoying the game.

The more I play Gloomhaven the more I like it. I was concerned repeated plays would get tedious, but the changes in tactics introduced by different heroes / maps / monsters and in-play cards makes each game a truly entertaining experience. I find the story elements to be the weakest part but I've never been much for storytelling in my games, as I prefer to let the story build in my head as I play (like Arkham Horror). And for tactical play, this game is nothing short of genius. The biggest down side is that the lengthy setup time, even with storage inserts, really prevents it from coming out as much as it should.

Fantastic Euro, and certainly more 'thinks' than I had anticipated. Because of the tight 'countdown timer' nature of your cards, you really have to optimize your groups actions. Only played twice so far but a great experience and looking forward to playing again. Could go up to a 9, but can't see it sliding too much.

Edit: 6 plays in and enjoying it more with each scenario. Bumped to a 9.

Rating changed to reflect current view on the game. Played it over 30 times. I have reset it, and sold it. The game is incredibly huge, and if this kind of game is your thing there's a ton of content in the box to keep you and your friends occupied for some time. The volume of content, however, is it's own drawback. Our last half dozen games were driven by a desire to finish, not because we really wanted to play, and that sucked out the last bit of fun that was left.  Ultimately, we found the play to become repetitive (changing monsters and classes, while technically altering tactics, doesn't effect how the game *feels*), also without investment in a storage solution the game easily takes 15-20 min to set up, and the same to take down.

Preorder edition with miniatures but without the Thank-You-Note

Somehow I expected this box to be bigger...
Don't get me wrong, there is so much stuff in there, unbelievable. After a few plays I can say that this looks pretty promising.

Come back for more feedback after a short commercial break.

14 games into the realm of Gloomhaven and I'm not seeing anything that will stop us from playing it.

---

After 30 games I sold it. Why? Because it got stale.
How? Well... There is nothing the game could offer me that was new.
Honestly the scenarios don't have that much replay value. Yes you can do it again to try a different strategy for it but there won't be something new.
The characters are the same.
It is pretty samey. The story is close to non-existant. If you are honest to yourself Gloomhaven promises way more that it can deliver. Immersive world and story and characters and gameplay...

No. The world comes down to a few texts on small event cards that are randomly drawn from a deck and therefor have no thematic connection to your current state of play. That is also true for the praised story. The story consists of a text at the beginning and one at the end of a scenario, which againb don't really have a connection to your state of play. You can advance in almost any order and through some decisions I made in my playthrough I had some pretty strong disconnects where the story didn't make sense anymore.

Besides that it is pretty much generic.
Yeah Isaac Childres designed a new world without the generic races and classes...but....let's be honest, somehow it still feels pretty generic. With a few exceptions.

I don't really get a connection to my char. I like the slow progress, that is somehow new to boardgames, where you normally are getting a level up faster or a level up feels stronger. But it is also somehow frustrating...not frustrating...more... boring.

Maybe it is the euro nature of this that doesn't fit the theme.
A euro-dungeon crawl sounds like some pretty innovative thing but at a certain point it wasn't fun anymore. There is no time to do as you like. No, you have to be efficient to achieve something.
A Conan is much better in keeping the players involved and at the edge of their seats. Gloomhaven feels way to slow and way to unspectacular.

I appreciate the design of low(er) luck through the hit-deck and all the things that it does but somehow...

Don't get me wrong. I loved the game for the first 15 plays liked it for the next 10...and I still think that it is a good design but for me there are too many things that made it stumble and fall.

I'm glad I made this experience so I eventually learned that this game is not for me and what I like about dungeon crawls and what I don't.

Vast majority of time on the table is spent in setup, cleanup and slogging through all of the fiddly bits of the monsters' turns rather than on player turns.  So, 90% of the time I feel like the game is playing me rather than the other way around.  My time is better spent elsewhere.

Started a campaign with a friend at his place. At the time I'm rating this we have cleared only the first 2 scenarios. Really looking forward to getting my own copy (in 1 week). I am playing the Brute and my friend is the Cragheart.
I love the fatigue system and the multi-choice action cards. I like also that the characters play differently. Also, the multiplayer game is really good!! Having the secret objectives cards and not being able to discuss exact numbers is really neat: we sometimes end up playing sub-optimal move and that is so frustrating in a good way! I wonder if there is too much admin above 2 players. The pace is also quite slow as this is more a tactical combat game than a real dungeon crawling game. I am quite excited about the game: I can't wait to make progress into the campaign! TBH the story isn't so appealling to me but I like that you discover new locations depending on your progress: thematically everything is very sound and solid.

11/16/17 - wow! this thing is enormous! Normally I would give up on games like this. Set up takes some time, putting the thing away is impossible - BUT 2 scenarios into the campaign with both being successful at the wire!I must have thought "there's no way we're getting out alive" at least 4 times during the second scenario and yet we pulled out the success. Very tight games so far, love the combat! Not sure I would like this as much as I do if the designer went with dice combat. Looking forward to continuing the adventure.

RATING: 9
First of all, this is singlehandedly and without hyperbole the most impressive and ambitious game design I've ever seen. It's almost a miracle that Childres was able to pull this off: a deep, engrossing, extremely thematic and highly replayable, legacy "board game-RPG" with solid, intuitive mechanics and a reasonable number of rules. 

The mechanic of having your hand serve as the "timer" is absolutely brilliant: it's a very elegant way of both simulating exhaustion and creating tough and tense decisions for the players (do I throw away this card now for its effect or keep it to extend my life?). I also like the added "loot" mechanic, which adds an almost push-your-luck element to each scenario (how much time do you think you'll need?).

The only problems I've found with the game are 1) scenarios can be really, really hard to win, and (partially because of the high difficulty), 2) it takes FOREVER to retire and get to play another character. I like my Brute enough, but I'm already jonesing to try a different character type, and at the rate I'm going, that will realistically happen in 30-45 more games (which might take years). I simply don't have the time, or the desire, to play this game as much as it demands, which means my rating will rise or fall depending principally on how often I get it to the table. 

Even still, it's a masterpiece. Game of the Year at minimum, and (currently ranked 192 at the time I'm writing) I'm going to go ahead and predict: by 2018, this will have ousted Pandemic: Legacy as the No. 1 rated game on BGG.

RATING: 10
Excellent dungeon crawl.  So many great ideas: the attack adjustment deck, gaining experience from doing actions rather than killing monsters, top/bottom card play, character retirement...it all comes together to create a fresh experience in a rather stagnant genre.  In the end the story wasn't quite as epic as I was hoping for, but I certainly enjoyed the ride!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The overarching story framework looks like it could be fun, but the setup and dungeon crawling are both fiddly and tedious. The card play acts as a mission timer, and generally boils down to move and attack, or attack and move, with the occasional special power. If setup didn't require a thousand pieces and dozens of decks of cards, and dungeon crawling was streamlined so each mission took a more appropriate 20-30 minutes rather than the 1.5-2hr slogs this game could be great.

It took me awhile to get around to playing it but this game is amazing.  I am a bit surprised by the hype because although I love the game, it doesn't strike me as something that would be as popular as it has become.

Lots of good times ahead if you can get a consistent group of friends to meet. HIGHLY recommend to get an organizer (I have broken token organizer). Set up and take down time is huge without it and the organizer makes the required table size reduced as well. Unless you've got the dream board game table where you never have to put away a game then you will want an organizer for this one. (Note: I do not usually buy organizers but this game is not your average game). Loads of fun.

RATING: 8.8
The legacy aspects (reincorporating player decisions, branching narratives, and world permanence) are all breathtaking and excellent. As a campaign game, the narrative hangs together somewhat well and it feels like an enormous accomplishment. The scope is unbelievable and the world feels alive.

The majority of play is in the tempo-based card system that you will grapple with to clear out dungeons. This is a very Euro mechanism, albeit one infused with drama thanks to attack decks with wild outcomes. The card system can be difficult to strategically grasp in your early plays, especially when engaging with one of the more difficult classes like the Spellweaver. Losing cards for the scenario can feel punishing and it seems as though the game is fighting you, wanting you to hold back.

After gaining some experience and comfort with the mechanisms, the system will turn on its head and you will feel empowered. Even at that point, the game still is a bit of a slow burn with thoughtful contemplation and heady decisions making a bulk of play. This isn't a high-speed rip roaring adventure where you cut through foes like butter. It's very atypical for this genre as it's slow-going with a multitude of high impact decisions.

What's really amazing is how well everything hangs together. The system is pretty streamlined and feeds right into the larger campaign. This doesn't feel like an underdeveloped Kickstarter game at all. That is an outright miracle given the magnitude of scope presented.

RATING: 9
Legacy strategy-puzzle game where you play a character whose actions are determined with pairs of unique action cards. Your character improves its capabilities by performing class actions that generate experience and completing scenario battle goals. Advancement gains access to new class action cards to exchange in your hand at the start of each scenario and improved modifiers cards to assist with the character's attack deck.

Challenge - plenty to keep me interested.
Variation with more than 95 basic and 10+ scenario plus deck of random scenarios mean there are more than 100 hours of play in the box.

With a couple of thousand cards and tokens, it is a chore to setup and put-away (about 30 minutes). A better box organizer is needed to maximize group playtime.

Postnote -  After a month of play and organizing the key components I am now under 20 minutes to setup / teardown. Enjoyable solo (2 characters) but more fun with three players. 

Revised - Rated 9 after a month of play (previous 8 during first play)

Is this game the dungeon crawler to end all dungeon crawlers? The answer is... I'm not really sure yet. It's a fascinating game, one which takes ever facet of the genre and condenses them into a series of smart interlocking systems that provides an unprecedented level of interesting choices.

That's not to say that the game is fiddly or overly complicated. It's not. There's a LOT in this game, so it does take some time to learn. But generally, things are intuitive and elegant. But while its rules aren't "complex" per se, its web of interlocking systems is [i]demanding[/i].

And that is arguably the cost to having the systems push and pull each other in such interesting ways. This game is [i]extremely[/i] mentally taxing. In other dungeon crawlers, there's a natural cadence to the strategic depth - earlier scenarios don't require much thought, and per-scenario the amount of mental gymnastics you're doing depends greatly on the number of enemies currently on the map. Not so in Gloomhaven. There's a massive amount of forward planning required in every decision - because you're always under the clock.

The "clock" is not the usual turn limit, but something much more interesting and player-driven, and as a result, complex. Running out of cards equals death, so card management becomes a complicated, nail-biting affair. From the very start, EVERY choice you make can have massive unforeseen (at least, by newbies) consequences. Doing something as simple as taking a turn to rest sees players untangling a knot of possible future outcomes when deciding which card to lose.

So that cost? Add "game length" to it. After all, when [i]every[/i] decision is a  brain-burner, the only result is taking time to consider your options.

So while Gloomhaven is hands down the most interesting and strategic dungeon crawler yet, I'm not quite sure it renders others obsolete. How much you agree will depend on how much you value those moments in other dungeon crawlers where you get to take a breather or make mistakes - having moments where you DON'T feel the weight of the world crushing down on you to just relax and have fun. Before Gloomhaven, I hadn't really considered the value of the times when your choices are obvious, or wiggle room to waste time. Of every dungeon crawler, it is the most [i]unlike[/i] D&D.

Is ~2.5 hours of mental labor fun for you? Or is it too much? For me, personally, the mechanics are such a goddamned joy in themselves that I'm happy to take the time... but I will acknowledge that I hope once we're more familiar with the rules and our characters that either its choices become a little more straightforward [i]sometimes[/i] or scenarios speed up a bit. Because after playing one game of Gloomhaven, I'm ready for a nap.

Retail Copy. The sheer magnitude of this game.  Took me over 2 hours to punch, organize, and sleeve.  Painting the first 6 char!  Played the first mission solo and one practice run with my two girls!  Wow tough but fair and a good thinking mans D&D!  Prob do a few more practice runs with the kids to figure out who we are going to play as and get our teamwork down.  Amazing work, I still can not fathom how one person made a game so massive in scale yet so fun and engaging to play.  With over 20 plays now and going strong with my two girls (11 and 6) this game is a solid 10 and the best of all the games we own.  I am so glad the 2nd kickstarter has hit so others can get a copy of this amazing work by Isaac.  Backed the "upgrade" kit on KS.

I have been playing board games for 30+ years, and Gloomhaven has already become my all-time favorite after only a few hours of play. The incredible level of thought and investment put into the thematic design is mind-blowing, including each character's unique deck, different leveling benefits based on class, and even career goals that define your life's mission! I'll likely play this game for the next 10+ years and love every minute of it.

RATING: 7
There is just a lot about Gloomhaven that doesn't really work for me, even though I've been engaged in a semi-weekly campaign of it for most of the past year. The combat feels really constrained and lacking in interesting combos for the PCs, the retirement system sucks most of the fun out of character progression for me, the CYOA options in the encounters seem too obvious most of the time, the scenario goals are too simple and repetitive (either kill all enemies or run through the dungeon to the end, over and over), and the story frankly isn't terribly compelling.

Update: After playing and during a lot of pseudo-DMing reading fluff for Mansions of Madness last weekend, at my next session I came to appreciate more how knowing the lore gives players a handle on the mechanics and theme of this game. I like how we're trying to cheer up the gloomy city, and that prosperity can only ever go forwards. With the right group, this is a pretty good RPG in a box.

2nd Update: The alignment system here seems to fall into the same trap that so many computer RPGs have. Choose the selfish evil option, get a reward that ends up being a pittance next to the reward reaped by consistently following the supposedly selfless good path. Nice life lesson, but it's a clash with the supposedly gritty shades-of-grey fluff here and in games like Fallout. I pretty much have no motivation to ever even try to play an antihero. My group has pretty much abandoned the conceit of the hard man mercenaries with secret selfish motivations that are supposed to restrain player cooperation at this point, except to occasionally jokingly stop to do a dumb thing in-game for "reasons".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The crazy thing about this game is that I want to play another scenario immediately after finishing the most recent scenario.  What can I do better?  What would I change?  Should we make the next scenario harder?  These types of follow up questions are what distinguish a good game from a great one.

Looking forward to playing it again.

Now that I've been playing for a few weeks, I LOVE playing Gloomhaven. I have been craving this kind of Legacy, Role Playing, Cooperative game my whole LIFE. The mystery, the unlockables, the random events, the infinite possibilities, the suspense about what's going to be in the next room, the hilarious experiences in each scenario in the campaign makes this game one of a kind. I LOVE being able to customize my character to fit my playstyle and smashing through a room absolutely FULL of repopulating enemies and emerging somehow victorious one turn from exhaustion. 

My husband and I enjoy playing table-top games--especially cooperative games, and when we first got our hands on Gloomhaven (2nd print), we were positively ecstatic. We obsessed over our characters and our cards and monster movement--reading and rereading the rule book and forums. 

Then we actually played, and I'll be honest, the very beginning scenarios were the OPPOSITE of an enjoyable experience. Not because everything wasn't beautiful and full of mystery and excitement, but because (even though we had read the rule-book multiple times) we had NO CLUE what we were doing.

We struggled. Like, SERIOUSLY struggled. There may have been some tears, wild angry outbursts, and 3-4 hours of constant frustratingly tense indecisiveness. 
And not just the first game, the first FEW GAMES. Nothing like failing a game so miserably that you start to dread pulling the game out ever again--especially after anticipating it for MONTHS!

For us at least, including a lower level tutorial game or two (as an optional prerequisite)  would have allowed us to understand our character's movements, attacks, and team card synergy as well as practicing monster movement--and STILL feel like we were involved in our role-playing campaign adventure (like the beginning of any video game) without making us feel like we were character switching, level-zero LOSERS with crippling card play anxiety.

THAT BEING SAID, once we figured out how our characters worked together, and laughingly learned how to play in the air of almost certain defeat; we started having a BLAST. (Note: We also ditched Cragheart/Scoundrel combo for Brute/Scoundrel combo)

Role playing as our characters encountered hilariously unfortunate events, enemies populating out of control, and unfortunate nulls drawn at a critical point in the game--and STILL managing to scrape a win ONE TURN from exhaustion has lead to nail-biting but exhilarating experiences that we have immensely enjoyed over the past two weeks of nightly gameplay--and will probably continue enjoying for months!

And to think we almost shelved it!

I can't believe the amount of stuff there is in that humongous box.  It's the biggest epic game I've tackled and probably half my playtime will be dedicated solely to this game.  I am not calling it my favorite game of all time just yet, but it very well could become that, and more!  

It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like grandiose, engaging and pure epic fun, you will love this game.  Koodos to Isaac Childres as I think the guy is crazy... I can't believe how much there is in there...

RATING: 10
Utterly compelling experience. The basic structure of the game is simple: your characters do stuff around town, then they go and try to complete a quest. Repeat. But what justifies this game's high rating is all the excellent elements that form this structure. The depth, the flavour of the world lore, the different enemies you face, and the different character classes available to play. There is a lot of originality injected into this game, and in the fantasy genre this is often difficult to attain.

This is a game intended to be played across DOZENS of sessions, and each cycle of Town/Scenario lasts at least 3 hours each. With as lofty as premise as this, there is always a danger of becoming jaded and disinterested in the game's mechanics. But Gloomhaven subverts this frenetically, all the time. Impossible to describe due to the game's depth. You just have to believe the hype in this instance.

EDIT: Today I changed my rating of Gloomhaven from a 9 to a 10. It has been five months since we began playing (at least once a fortnight, oftentimes weekly) and it is often the highlight of our working week. We discuss the game constantly even when we're not playing it - if anything, rather than becoming bored and over-familiar with the game, we have just become more obsessed!

"Gloomhaven" makes me wish my job was playing "Gloomhaven." Other dungeon crawlers lean heavily on dice rolls, and that luck element that can make the experience frustrating at times. But here, it's all on you, baby. No dice - just your keen wits, planning, and card selection between you and death. It's exquisite. If I could only have one game to play on a desert island, it'd be "Gloomhaven."

RATING: 10
Despite the "Best with 3" rating here, my wife and I enjoy playing this as a 2 player co-op more than anything else we've tried. The balance in the game seems really well implemented, with our success or failure often coming in the last moments of a scenario, and the slower progression make things feel more epic. 
We've yet to try having some our friends along for a scenario, but I can see that happening at some point. The ability for others to drop in and out of our campaign is a really cool concept, and fits well with the setup of each character you play being rather self centred.

Our only real complaints at this point are that the constant sliding of standies into the stands it quickly wearing on the card stock, and that you can see the whole layout of the dungeons during setup. Perhaps an implementation were the actually scenarios where on cards like the random dungeons that you only flipped over when you entered each room might have worked well. 

But these are very minor things, and no need to give the game anything less than a full 10.

RATING: 10
Absolutely outstanding. Probably the finest example of a dungeon crawler I have played to date.

Normally I would be disappointed by the lack of dice but There's so many of those that this feels like something very unique and fresh.

Cons:
- Takes a long time to set up. Takes a long time to play with a part of 4.
- A big commitment.

The edge: 
The edge gloomhaven has above other similar legacy campaign games is the card play. In all such games you unlock stuff, incrementally progress, learn and become attached to your character, and slowly unravel the story. While Gloomhaven does have much more of this than many other games, I've barely scratched the surface of all that content. What then, makes Gloomhaven so compelling? At its core, Gloomhaven has good gameplay. The basic mechanics of Gloomhaven have two main restrictions which both encourage strategy as well as social interaction:
- Pairing Top and Bottom of two cards
- Initiative.
Pairing top and bottom of two separate cards means your actions are restricted. If you want to attack a distant enemy this turn you have to walk up to it. This means you have to play one of your move cards and perform some basic strategic thinking. If you can't move this turn, you might ask your teammate to leave up a monster close to you so you can still attack. Basic social interactions.
Initiative (also because you're not supposed to say what you plan for the turn) also encourages strategic thinking. You want to attack the monster next to you before it attacks you. That means you have to play certain cards. But you also want to go faster than your teammate because otherwise you're blocking them off and they won't get an attack in.

Other Pros:
- Tons of stuff.

9 and not 10 cus I imagine it's feasible to finish the campaign and get through all the content

SO. GOOD.
4/12/2017: Still playing with the same two groups and started another 'alternate world' group to play through a different branch of the campaign. Just today, question posed 'What are we doing? Treasure, Power or clearing that nest?' and three people answered differently. I love this game. I'll also note that this was only one group, the second group isn't doing any of these three things.

The branching campaign path is definitely a positive here. In my estimation you need 4 playthroughs to play every scenario in the campaign because of how others get locked.
11/12/2017:
Still playing this long with two groups a week. We've finally gotten to 7 scenarios not Complete. I've offered to stop hosting, and everyone still says 'But we still want to play this game.' It's. That. Good.

I think I'm mostly writing this review as a counter to all of the spiteful people who have given this game 1-star as "balance" to the Kickstarter fanboys.

Gloomhaven is anything but a 1-star game.

If you are looking for the unlimited flexibility that a pen and paper RPG offers: Gloomhaven is not what you are looking for, nor does it claim to be such. What it claims to be, and what it delivers, is a 2-4 player co-op, dungeon-crawling campaign that is card-based instead of dice-based. This campaign will also take you about 18 months to complete if you can get together only once per week with your group--as my group does.

Gloomhaven is a RPG lite. You don't get to increase your strength or endurance; you never get a bigger card hand than each class initially starts with; you can't try to reason with any of the monsters you encounter in the scenarios. You do get to augment your attack modifier deck to eliminate bad randomness; you do get new abilities (cards) and can switch your build from scenario to scenario; and you get a huge world with lore already fleshed out to explore and choices to make in that world. To me, the difference between the pen and paper RPGs and RPG lites is you write the story in the former and you read the story in the latter. Maybe you and your group are amazing storytellers: I am not. But, at the point my group is at in Gloomhaven, it feels like we're leaving the Shire, or Winterfell, or the Two Rivers (or whomever you think is a great fantasy author or whatever you think is a great series/story) and we have no idea how it is going to end, but it feels like it will be, for lack of a better, trite, and overused word, epic.

It's easy to cherry pick the comments of people who min-max in games, using them as overarching examples of how the system of Gloomhaven is flawed, bringing overpowered characters that have been solo-leveled when no one else is around, assigning clandestine motives and other insidious sweeping generalizations on those who have rated this game so highly. These people are present in every game: they look up the best strategies, have little regard for spoilers, and seek to exploit game mechanics in order to win or do the best. Gloomhaven is not chess. The players are not pitted against other players, but, rather, against a set system. It is a puzzle. Once your party's and monsters' initiatives are revealed, every player can figure out exactly what the enemy is going to do and when. Variance is introduced by the attack modifier decks, but, anyone can generally know exactly who will be attacked by what and for how much damage.

The personal quest cards, battle goal cards, city and road events, etc. all add flavor and lore to make it so the characters and methods of play vary from scenario to scenario. I probably would have never created an extraordinarily greedy healer-type character who runs through a dungeon opening doors, creating undue stress on the group because now we have multiple rooms' worth of monsters to fight, but those were the cards I drew and it was entertaining playing a completely different way and still barely coming out of the dungeon victorious.

To sum this up: tic-tac-toe and the card game War are one-star games. Gloomhaven isn't perfect; I don't know of a game that is, Perhaps the "fanboys" claim it is, I don't know. Pandemic: Legacy, in my opinion, shouldn't crack the top 50. (Nor the top 100, even) I highly dislike and do not enjoy playing it. Is it a 1? Of course not, but I'm not so petty to rate it as such to bring down its rating even though I personally think its rating is entirely too high. Gloomhaven, though, is an outstanding game that I will enjoy playing for the foreseeable future and, as such, according to BGG's rating system, Gloomhaven, for me and my gaming group, is a 10.

It's all right.  Slightly better than 'meh'.

The good: diceless tactical game.  AI for creatures is novel and interesting, and keeps things on your toes.  The sense of scale to the worldbuilding is immense, and the resulting world is well done.  This game could replace D&D for a group that plays D&D for the combat instead of the roleplaying.  The overarching campaign and how that's handled is well done.

The bad: still prone to the problems of most tactical games, namely strict analysis paralysis.  The shrinking hand mechanic means your entire group can be screwed over by random link.  About 30% too complicated, with so much bookkeeping that even experienced groups can miss steps.

RATING: 5
I tried Gloomhaven out only once at SPIEL Essen 2017 and only skimmed the rules, so you may want to take this comment with more than one grain of salt. My rating could well change with further games, but a 5 is my best estimate for now.
However, I feel confident in already saying that I think this game is overhyped and overrated. Apparently, the publisher contributed to that by prompting people "Don't forget to rate this a 10 when you pre-order!". Which I view as at least dubious behavior (on the publisher's part). I have deducted one point from the rating I would otherwise have given to protest against it and offset the unfairly high rating a tiny bit.
- As for how the game plays, I dislike the way the game tries to solve a possible alpha gamer problem by having vague and circumventable rules which information you are allowed to discuss during the game. I don't think there should be any restrictions on which information players are allowed to divulge in a game like this. I searched the rulebook for this issue, thumbs up that the rules at least include a remark about playing like this as a variant and how to compensate difficulty level if one does.
- The potentially problematic player elimination mechanic that the game has when a character gets "exhausted" gets worse if played without open information so that the dropped out players have a harder time to still somewhat participate in the game. How bad this is depends a lot on how frequently exhaustion happens, not sure about that.
- I don't dislike legacy aspects in general, but I think the game should be completely resettable - particularly when it is as expensive as Gloomhaven. I hate it when the rules require you to permanently modify your game. Gloomhaven includes numerous irremovable stickers. At least a third party company already offers a set of removable stickers to replace them. I would have expected the original publisher to include that in the game or at least sell it as an optional add-on themselves.

RATING: 10
An epic adventure that revolutionizes Dungeon Crawlers.

Pros:
-Very interesting tactical decisions
-Varied & relatively deep deterministic combat (much deeper than your usual dice-chucker)
-Varied character classes and playstyles
-Looting! Lots of new items to discover
-A Story that grows with every new scenario
-Absolutely incredible value for money in that big box.

Cons:
-Somewhat fiddly
-Lots of bits and pieces makes storage inconvenient
-Manual isn't very streamlined (although I've seen much worse).

The best dungeon-crawler out there as of 2017. 
One of my top games ever.

Game is quite fun for the first 2 or 3 sessions. Then it is just boring and repetive.
The combat system (which is 99% of the game) is quite nice, you can have some interesting decisions and nice heroic actions, I like it. 
But you do the same all over again, there is no variety, all scenarios feel the same and are nice for the first 20 minutes than you are just exhausted and bored. Im sorry, I was a fan after my first game, but now I feel sick when I think about putting this game on my table again, with all this setup and  milions of components.
Game could be more streamlined and faster with interesting scenarios (those in the game feels like mass produced in one evening, they feel the same) and some more things to do. The game potential is great, it is something new for sure. It can be the beginning of a nice saga. Im sure that streamlined Gloomhaven 2 - smaller, but more polished, could be a great game - but now it is a spiral of hype. If you are a classic RPG fan - I recomend, if not - dont trust the rating.

RATING: 8
Provisional rating after having the chance to play one of the first levels. I definitely fell in love with the interesting card-driven action (and time) system, which is a major improvement over the typical distribution of action points. Mission development and focus on combat, however, still felt like pretty standard dungeon-crawl fanfare, which really isn't my cup of tea. I liked it quite much, but I'd definitely need to play it several times and experience the character development system in detail, and see how mission design progresses, to get the whole picture.

I am very disappointed in this game. I really wanted to love it. I've been wanting a dungeon-crawl game with more interesting gameplay than roll-to-resolve for the longest time, and I hoped this would be it. Unfortunately, it plays way too slowly (at least for my group), and I found it to be too fiddly, both with all the chits and the many persnickety rules. The gameplay just never came alive for me. The fresh take on a fantasy theme sounds good in theory, but I found it a little off-putting.

This is just too much, and not for us.

First, the physical setup is a huge pain, finding the right monsters and tokens and tiles, setting up the monster cards, the various draw decks, dealing with the town inventory and events, ... it takes too long.

That would be fine, but the game just isn't that interesting.  Enter small dungeon, kill a bunch of boring mobs, repeat.  The card play is interesting, I guess, as there's a few combos, but it doesn't compare to Mage Knight.  Your character does a few interesting things, and every so often you get a neat combo, but it's usually just Attack (top) and Move (bottom).  The game becomes less interesting as your options dwindle, and it's just stupid when you have 2 cards in hand: do a thing, rest, lose.

Just do that for 2-3 hours.  For 1 session.  Of 70-95.

There's lots of great stuff in here, lots of promise, but I doubt I'll ever get to see any of it, which is a real shame.

Wonderful wonderful game. I have been waiting and waiting for a fully engrossing dungeon crawl campaign and this is finally it. The card-based combat is incredibly rewarding and strategic. The over-arching campaign and leveling-up system is exactly what I have hoped other games would provide. The rewards feel earned and substantial. I have been playing solo with 2 characters and it is my favorite. I cannot see it leaving its spot, literally, on my table for a long time. I can't wait to bump each character up a level or enhance a card, or discover a new location. It is really good.

Fantastic game, it does almost everything really well, so it's easier to list the few things that could be improved.  
1. Having to continually ask people what initiative they're playing on.
2. Having to look up enemy movement rules every single match
3. Losing checkmarks when you don't lose a checkmark if you have a set of 3 is silly

Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic game, and is especially great if these are the only things I can complain about.

RATING: 9
Things you need to know going in:

- This game is a commitment. I keep it mostly set up on one table to cut down on setup time. I only play solo so far, because getting a group together is too much extra hassle to play the game. I also play one scenario over the course of several days because I can only play for about a hour at a time after work. If you want a quick, 2-hr dungeon crawl experience that you can set up and play at a game night every month or so, this is NOT the game for you. (Play Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game instead :P)

- Tactical* combat-oriented. The bulk of this game is about card-play and dudes-on-a-map combat. There's some story elements, branching paths, etc. but it only serves to take you to the next combat scenario. And each scenario is about fighting dudes in different ways--it's not about solving puzzles, searching for items, looking for clues. The combat is the puzzle. Combat, combat, combat.

- *And it's more like Mage Knight-style combat. The focus is on cards--you play cards and to deal damage. Better card combos = more damage. Positioning on the map is somewhat important, but not as much as your typical miniatures game. There's really no such thing as cover, for instance. There are some terrain elements, but they are either traps (enter tile = bad stuff happens) or obstacles (can't enter tile unless flying or jumping). No chairs you can pick up and hurl at enemies for extra damage or pits you can make enemies fall into. It does cut down on the amount of rules you have to remember.

High points:

- Classes play very differently. Different types of build for the same class plays differently. Different enemy types actually feel different. Lots of content in the box.

- Card mechanic for combat makes for some very agonizing decisions. It also makes for a nice narrative structure. Your most powerful abilities are also usually 1-time use, so it ramps up the tension when you have to use them. You also tend to save them for the final moments of the scenario (because if you use too much of them early on, you get exhausted and lose the scenario).

- Just the right amount of randomness from the Enemy AI decks and the attack modifier decks. Not so little that games feel samey. Not so much that your strategies go out the window.

- Story tidbits where the world is slowly revealed is pretty cool. I wish the cards and the scenario books had more art on them to be really immersive. (Yes, this would make for a more expensive game....)

- Rules make thematic sense. Not of lot of rules overhead to remember when compared with games of similar complexity. I think this is because of the strict focus of the game: card-based combat. Everything else besides the cards are streamlined. Since there's no such thing as cover, ranged combat rules are easy to remember. Since there's only two terrain types, terrain rules are easy to remember. 

- The "normal" difficulty is punishing but fair. This feels like a well-balanced, carefully play-tested game. The difficulty level is adjustable, which is a nice plus.

Low points:

- Lots and lots and lots of shuffling

- Could theoretically grind your way to victory because there is no penalty for losing scenarios, and if you lose, you still get gold and EXP. It gets tempting to grind because, due to legacy elements and the RPG-style advancement, the game is kind of like a Skinner box. You could end up replaying scenarios over and over again without any real enjoyment just for those sweet, sweet unlocks. Just don't play that way! Some self-discipline is required.

- Minimal storage provided with the game. The insert is better than nothing (like what Fantasy Flight gives you) but if you want set up to be manageable at all, you'll need to come up with your own storage solution. Many good examples for cheap on the forums. I've ended up using 1 GMT counter tray, 2 small plano type boxes, the provided insert and a bunch of baggies. Setup takes about 15 minutes. I could get it down further with some file folders and some paper CD cases, but then I might have trouble fitting everything back in the box...

- That's it! The game itself is pretty great!

We are nearing the end of our campaign, so I thought I’d update my thoughts. I have played over forty games (some I forgot to record so I’m not sure) and although I have not been present for every game I have been for most.  

The card tactical combat system is very good and quite gamey, which is the main thing that has kept me interested. Each scenario is a puzzle to be solved, using a combination of current group powers and strategic approach. No matter how hard the scenario, it’s rare that we can’t beat it on a second try with a revised strategy. Combining cards and equipment is interesting and the primary draw of the game. 

Most of the rest, I’m afraid, doesn’t do it for me. Admittedly I don’t own the game and so don’t have the luxury of delving into the background as much as I'd like (but thanks to Isaac for avoiding dwarves and elves and orcs...I would never have played if they were in the game). I’ve tried to care about the background and story, but I just don’t. 

The rules system, beyond the very clever card use, is an odd combination of clever and silly. Why is there never anything to hide behind? Why do exploding things hit your enemy but not your allies? Why can you do wounds and poison and such without actually hurting the enemy? How come I can’t knock my enemy into a pit? 

Regardless, it’s impressive as hell. A huge fantasy campaign in a box that doesn’t require a gamemaster. Scenarios can be very samey, but particularly as the game goes on you run into more variety. Monsters vary in their powers and can greatly effect the personality of a scenario, requiring different strategies. The player characters have interesting differences that cause new approaches. 

So...it’s good, but mainly as a tactical combat game. It certainly destroys Descent in that role. If I hadn’t committed myself to the campaign at the beginning, however, it’s unlikely I would have played this anywhere near forty times. It just doesn’t have enough story to pull me back. Even my fellow players who enjoyed it much more than me are looking beyond the end of the campaign as they tire of it. 

When will someone who can write a good story do something like this?

Have played the first few scenarios now and thoroughly enjoying the game. It's a dungeon crawl with every dungeon a new puzzle to solve.
It scratches the RPG itch without a dungeon master having to prepare hours of content in advance and the dungeon crawl system means that when we lose it's because of our decisions not bad luck on the dice!

RATING: 6
This is a game that you are absolutely going to screw up multiple rules questions for at least two or three games.

Most of the complaints seem to be that the card-based tactical element is the real weakness. Honestly, the card-and-board interaction is just fine with me. I find the tension of watching your options shrink as you lose cards and push forward to be a very flavorful mechanic that really fits the theme. 

Like all really dense co-op tactical games, this this is really, really fiddly. I also think there is a lot of needless complexity baked in. In addition to bookkeeping your own character on a pen and paper character sheet, you also track a pen and paper party character sheet, as well as a large "world map" gameboard that largely exists to be a decoration after the game is over, I guess. Road and City events are another thing that adds very little to the experience except for occasionally getting to tear up cards. 

It's the heaviest and best made game of it's type, if you're willing to put in the sweat equity and really like that sort of game I could see where it would be very, very appealing, but it is not even close to a 9.0 except maybe against the fields of exactly this game type. 

Lots of comparisons to "playing D&D without a DM." As a lifelong DM, it would almost certainly just be easier to learn Dungeons and Dragons.

Finally a dungeon crawler for the euro gamer. The card play perfectly fixes my biggest gripe in ameritrash games: dice combat.  I still look forward to each game, when I usually tire of campaigns after a couple games. Excellent game design.

RATING: 8.5
This is a behemoth.  It takes a while to set-up the game.  The choosing of the right cards from the hand can be AP-inducing.  But overall, the system is challenging but doable. It can sometimes take a party three or more tries to finish one scenario, particularly if they aren't yet at the right level.

Beautiful components and a lot of fun in playing and discovering the world. It's challenging, but not too much. Card management is important and a little bit of luck is involved, but yeah, love this game! First I had to do a lot of thinking if I would use the stickers, but I decided to play it as intended, and it's a good decision indeed. It's a lot of fun to put the stickers on the map and feels like you are earning something. Did I already say  that I love this game :)

I'm in love with dungeon crawlers and played many over the years, from heroquest to imperial assault, they were fun but all lacking some critical elements of a complete rpg and limited in content (unless you were willing to spend your whole salary on expansions) now Gloomhaven is the game i've been waiting for since my childhood, impressive amount of components, in deep character progression, immersive world (and an original one, not the overabused classic fantasy style), boss fights, 17 classes, each playing in their very own style, no need for a fixed number of players for each session...i was blown away and i think about playing it even at work (hope my boss won't read this lol), amazing!

This is a preliminary rating and might go up or down slightly after more plays. I am enjoying this game a lot. I like the tactical combat a lot and the neat combos you can achieve on your own or in conjunction with other players. I also like the built in monster AI in the game. It is especially cool when they manage to disrupt your careful plan. It is a bit of a nightmare to set up and tear down and manage while playing, which is the main drawback of the game, but the gameplay is stellar.

Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.

This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

Most games I buy I like first try, and want to play again, you know, like "next time we meet up."  Gloomhaven is the first game that I own that I want to play again IMMEDIATELY!  Are you free tomorrow?  One more scenario!  

Incredibly addictive, supremely designed, and great writing.  It scratches my dungeon crawling itch, along with my brain-burning strategy itch and overall theme takes me back to my D&D days.  It irks me that there's so much unlockable stuff!  Can't wait to break open my first sealed envelope, or first new secret character.

Master class.

RATING: 9.5
I will probably raise this to a 10 one day, as it’s just a really cool game with so many interesting parts.  The idea of a constantly evolving world that parties can drop in and out of in a board game is really cool. 

The battle system is unique, and makes for a many tough decisions. It’s challening, but we haven’t had a character die yet (playing with oerma-death rules), so it’s not unfair. We feel like we are progressing reasonably well, but after 11 games we have only retired two characters, so you still need to work toward those goals, nothing is given freely. 

I would say that my only major gripe right now is with the looting system, where the treasure has often been underwealming in general, leading to a lack of excitement over finding that cool item to use.  Perhaps we haven’t just found the really cool stuff yet, but it’s probably the weakest system in the game for me right now. 

It’s a classic, anyone remotely interested in this type of game should buy it immediately.

The only thing keeping it from a ten is it doesn't just admit it is a solo game.  

The only steps towards good co-op design are the secret objective cards "just let me open the door please" and the ridiculous "you can only talk in character" rule.  A co-op game needs some mechanism to keep one person from bossing the game around, and forcing them to say "medium fast" instead of just "35" is hack.  

Damage Report, Space Alert, Dead of Winter, and Battlestar all added something to make everyone feel like they were playing.  This game is based on mercenaries; it could have done something with that to make player involvement more even.

But oh man, as a solo "D&D Legacy", I'm going to play this one for years.  It's up there with Pathfinder Card Game 1 & 3 (sorry 2, you sucked).

What a great game! The campaign story keeps players interested and looking forward to each further mission to unlock a little more of the story.  The best part in my opinion, is the discovery of new foes around every corner, and wondering if you are going to make it back to Gloomhaven alive after the next battle.
I think this is a well polished game that is a lot of fun.

My wife and are having a very good time working our way through the campaign.  The campaign elements are very well done, definitely the best I have seen in a legacy style boardgame.  However, what keeps us comping back is that the combat system is very interesting and keeps offering to us new tactical challenges.  The combat modifier deck is a great way to add a bit of unpredictability and special effects to the fights, and it injects just the right amount of randomness.  I very much enjoy working out the puzzle of when to employ certain cards, and when to spend the one-time use cards.  

However, mixed with these enjoyable thought decisions are a few choices that I find unpleasant.  I don't like having to choose before the mission which cards to exclude, nor do I like choosing which card to lose during a long rest; these are just too painful and I prefer the random selection in the short rest.

I also love that the Kickstarter provided a "Standees" version of the game.  I prefer these to unpainted gray minis any day.

RATING: 8.4
3(4) player campaign:
Day 1: first game, #1 (we lost horribly): 8.0
Still trying to figure out how to effectively use the cards. Many mistakes were made. One player was almost out of the game early on thanks to stupid decisions by everyone.

Day 2: 2nd try at #1, close win, felt a little too easy considering our horrible card drawing luck, awesome item reward: 8.1
The second run was relatively smooth. Everyone got to do something. Not bad for a first map. 

Day 3: #2, AWESOME LEVEL, great experience for everyone: 8.8
We really enjoyed this fight. We got lucky a couple of times and won decisively. Early High Point, more like this, please. First Player leveled up after the conclusion.

Day 4: #Side Scenario by Rob Daviau, we messed up again and lost by running out of cards: 8.2
Encountered a horrible Road Event and had a somewhat miserable experience. In the end, it got pretty close, but no cigars.

Day 5: #Side Scenario by Rob Daviau, 2nd try, had to restart the map after 20 minutes and on the second try, we more or less breezed through: 8.2
Before we set out the 3rd player reached level 2. We played with only 3 players (#4 dropped out). Solid experience.

Day 6: #3, Scenario level Easy (1) with 3 players (c-lvls 3-2-2): 8.2
The hardest part was looting the treasure before the win condition hits. The Spawn Point added some small variation, otherwise nothing spectacular if you min-max it.

Day 7: #8, Scenario level Easy (1) with 4 players (c-lvls 3-2-2-1): 8.5
We should have played on Normal, Map felt too easy. The Story picks up its pace which is certainly welcome. Looking forward to seeing how this pans out.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after a few scenarios.  

PROS:  
* Characters can retire after completing what seems to be a small number of scenarios.  This can allow flexibility in the play group.
* The card selection mechanic for each combat round leads to some difficult and interesting choices and some good group discussion.
* The timing aspect and deck thinning due to cards lost for the session is quite interesting as well.
* City and Road Events provide some options and variation.
* Cool, unique and interesting character classes.
* Fun co-op experience, and I don't usually like those.
* Leveling up and equipment shopping are satisfying.
* Ambitious design and long-term scope.


CONS:
*  There is surprisingly little art and illustration in the game. Tons of text. The box cover is a bit misleading in that regard.   Graphic design isn't too appealing.
*  Tons and tons of fiddly NPC/AI things need to be managed.  I feel like the game really wants to have a GM or Overlord player.
*  Sometimes the boardgame rules get in the way, or trump, the RPG aspect.   All the treasure and loot disappears when the last enemy is killed on a map?  That's purely there for game-y reasons.
*  The narrative and story elements aren't too compelling.   The world isn't (yet) all that rich or engaging.
*  The little wooden XP and HP markers a joke.   They don't work in the slots whatsoever.  
*  The miniatures have a bit of a low-res 3D-printed kind of graininess to them.  
*  Unsure about the magic system.
*  Moves a little slow.  2.5-3 hours per scenario.

I have played about 11 scenarios at this point and still love every moment of the game.  My game group and I do believe that a few of the items are unbalanced.  This is the reason for a 9 and not a 10.  We also don't like the poison mechanic and think it is a little underwhelming.  Besides these few minor cons, we still enjoy playing and look forward to many more hours of playtime between now and when KDM come through the mail:)

RATING: 10
I spent months - and months - salivating for this. Obsessing over it. By the time it arrived for second printing I was wondering if this would really live up to the huge hype, or would it be disappointing as "only" a good game.

No - this is the real deal - and it matches/surpasses the hype. I would say this is the boardgame version of X-Com - the classic PC game where you play a tactical match which gives you bonuses on the strategy layer so you can level up your characters and advance and have more interesting tactical matches. Same virtuous circle here - fantastic tactical game, where you gain XP/Coins/whatever to advance the meta-game - which unlocks new items, abilities, characters, and maps to enhance the tactical game.

So in short? Wow!

Kickstarter project, ETA [-]May 2016 in [b]Germany[/b][/-]. [b]LATE[/b] and switched to Serbian address. Arrived Mar 2017.

:star::star::star:

Great core concept with card driven cooperative puzzle solving wrapped in fantasy dungeon crawler, RPG theme. Races and classes are unique and fresh with mixed all familiar fantasy tropes. The core mechanic with multi function cards, element infusions and party reputation which adjusts the prices of items in town, clearly draws inspiration from [b]Mage Knight[/b] which the designer really loves. Cleanup and setup times are exhausting since the game is huge and has millions of components. Rules are all over the place and FAQ is getting longer every day. Fantastic and brilliant idea, which has years of honing ahead.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Planning actions by selecting two cards from hand, choosing initiative value from one of those cards and then resolving top of one and bottom of the other in any order.

Only 1 play so far and it was fun. I really enjoy the hand management and how it's tied into the end game (built in clock). I've played several campaign based, cooperative dungeon crawls including Mice and Mystics, Temple of Elemental Evil and Imperial Assault and this is the best (IA will give this a run though once the app is out and you can play completely cooperatively).

With the above in mind, I had a couple of opportunities to purchase this and didn't as it's not a good fit for me now. There's no way I could get through all of the content and, in general, I don't like cooperative games as much as competitive... so if I were to get this it would be for solo play as it wouldn't be my first choice to play 40+ cooperative sessions. Component quality is OK and setup appears to be a bit difficult. The story looks like it could be quite engaging, but not for occasional play, would need to commit to play the game out. I can definitely see people who like cooperative campaign games liking this one, but I think there's a little hype pumping up the ratings. I put this at a 7, it's a good game and I wouldn't mind occasionally sitting in a session but not something I would buy (maybe when my son gets older).

RATING: 10
This game is a work of mad genius and the passion that Isaac Childres poured into its making is clearly visible. The sheer scope of the games - over 90 adventures, over 40 types of monsters, dozens of items and over 15 characters, each with their own deck of cards - is awe inspiring.  The game is so huge that the legacy aspect is an added perk rather than a drawback (for those who don’t like altering a game); exploring and having that sense of discovery and wonder and "wow" factor as with a role playing game is a definite plus. It doesn't really strike me like the sort of game you play through multiple times. At its core it’s a skirmish dungeon crawler, and in its mechanics it’s a deck builder. There are no dice in this game and the random factor is introduced using modifier decks that add or subtract from the main result. The game is very impressive, as each round requires thought as you choose which cards to play and how. Its not a beer and pretzels game, you really need to play smart or the adventures will chew you up.
This is a massive game and provides a massive experience. Hats off to Isaac Childres!!!

It's ok... but the combat system could be better. Or atleast, I didn't like all of it. The using of the 2 cards to set up your next action, together with the extra deck of cards that tell you if you do more or less the damage your cards told you that you do. The multiple different uses you can have for cards... I know this is all there to improve the possibilities, but somehow the options of the cards still felt pretty restrictive. Especially as you could but couldn't really communicate with your team before choosing the cards to set up?

If that text sounds a bit confusing... well, it's because it can be confusing, or rather, feel a bit chaotic. I did understand the rules, but they didn't feel "there" yet. Could be that this was simply because of the demo mission we were playing, in which we get tought nothing of the legacy kind of board, about the upgrading system and about improving your chances.

For now, it feels like a euro rpg and nothing all that special (except the big box... that thing is huge!)

Richard and I had one play (I was the Scoundrel). I like how the characters are not generic at all and the card options and choices provide plenty of options during the game. I'm not sure whether I like the loot mechanic (even though as the Scoundrel it felt perfectly in character to run around stealing it all!) due to its tension with the working together to defeat the monsters, but it will probably take quite a few more plays for me to appreciate that design choice.

22/2 Played a second game in campaign mode as the Spellweaver (4-player game). I really like the way the mechanics interweave with a persistent world and the character progression feels about right. I was unlucky with my scenario objectives as they clashed with how I wanted to play, but that does provide an interesting tension too.

11/4 Played a third game in campaign mode as the Spellweaver (3-player game). This came right down to wire and I managed to use the wind jump ability to get to a good treasure chest, then improve my combat ability and kill the various enemies in my room before exhausting. Our last player managed to clean up the last few monsters to snatch a win from the jaws of defeat. Great game. Looking forward to playing again. Upgraded my ranking from 9 to 10.

July 2017 I bought this game second hand and started a 2 player campaign with my 11 year old son. I am a Mind Thief and he is the Brute. As of October, we've racked up 23 plays and are really enjoying this experience.

Need more plays to get a fuller sense of the game, but it does seem to live up to the hype. It's a true work of art from a designer who created the "D&D experience in a boardgame" par excellence. 

The game is a mix of RPG elements in a living world with a complex card game. That is, the locations that you discover are stickered on your board and are now permanent. The level of your party's reputation and Gloomhaven city's level determine the items you can purchase. If you decide to play again with another party, you leave the stickers on the board because those are now known to anyone entering this world (i.e., the world is a living thing and does not get reset). As your party completes achievements, you gain achievement stickers that go on the board as well.

The other part of the game rivals Mage Knight in its cardplay complexity. You have a small deck of cards for each adventure, around 10. You choose which of your available cards to take into this adventure so there's a light deck construction aspect. However, there's no shuffling and you choose which cards to play each turn, one for the top action and the other for the bottom. Figuring out how to use the top of one card and the bottom of another is surprisingly much more difficult than you'd expect. 

During the game, cards are either discarded or lost (out of the game). When you rest so as to recover your discards, you must lose one card thus modeling a sense of character exhaustion. If you're ever unable to play two cards, you're exhausted.

The thing is a beast in many ways. First off, you'll need some sort of organization system to keep all the room tiles and overlays straight (is this fog or water?) as well as the numerous enemy chits and AI cards. There's a thread (to which I contributed) that I recommend for comparing organizers and seeing which, if any, work for you (you may just want Plano boxes). 

Also, the enemy AI rules seem straightforward when read, but when you play, you realize how intricate they are. Another thread I recommend is the AI monster movement test. It helped us get the intricacies straight. Still, expect a bit of rules learning curve and your nose in the rulebook a fair bit for the first one or two sessions.

I soured on Descent/SW: IA for the way the game imposes a single way to play those games (keep moving!) and decided to KS the 2nd edition of this one. I'm very glad I did as it seems like the dungeon crawl game of choice for my tastes (love complex card games). My rating is "only" an 8.5 at this point because it remains to be seen if the fun of the game continues to outweigh the maintenance of setup, tear down, and record keeping. On that note, I'm off to print some record-keeping sheets...

Finally, a dungeon crawler/RPG board game that I'm not thinking "I would rather just play pen and paper" the entire time.

The story elements are solid.  The card play is incredibly tactical and engaging.  The interaction between the classes is what I would expect from a rich RPG experience.

The only draw back is that setup is a huge pain.  I need more Plano boxes!

Edit - I enjoy this game greatly.  The story elements are way above average, but maybe not as great as I originally thought.  The major detractor and the bump down from the 10 is due to setup time.  The game is a chore to setup, tear down, etc.

[b]TL;DR[/b] A surprisingly dull game, with a too-long setup.  It's fine, but I wouldn't ask for another game.


I usually wait until ten plays before rating a game, but Gloomhaven is a game I expect not to play much again, if at all, so I'm going to write down my thoughts while they are fresh in my mind.

First, a caveat:  I played the game in the random dungeon crawl mode, so I did not experience all of the legacy stuff.  I am rating this based purely on the mechanisms of the individual dungeon crawls, and not on the overall story.  After playing many other story-driven games, I don't think it would be possible for the story to sway my opinion very much.  I adored Pandemic Legacy, because the mechanisms of the game are super fun to me, so the story layered on top of those was awesome.  If the underlying mechanisms don't grab me, though, I don't see myself going back to the game just for a story or to power up my characters.

Good:  Clever two-card system that controls initiative and allows you to do some planning but modify your plans, simple AI decks for the monsters, characters that play wildly differently

Bad:  Massively fiddly setup, not seeing progression of a character within a single game, losing cards as a timer mechanism.

I think the thing that bugs me most about Gloomhaven is how it reverses the power curve of most games.  From a simple deck builder like Dominion to a complex beast like Too Many Bones, throughout the game you get more powerful.  You add cards to your deck or dice to your pool, and get to do more and more cool stuff.  In Gloomhaven, you keep removing cards from your hand, and can do less and less.  It might be thematic, representing exhaustion as you delve deeper into a dungeon, but it's just not very fun to me.

I liked stuff about the game, and imagine the legacy elements and long-term power-up of your characters would certainly improve it, but the core mechanisms are just not engaging enough to make me choose to invest that much time and effort.  It's a game that's completely [i]fine[/i], but I'm not spending that much money, and using that much shelf space, for a game that's just fine.

I haven't played yet. Reading the rules and have punched the game. 

This looks exciting and specifically, it looks like Magic Realm!

2/12/2018 - Played for the first time this past weekend and here are some thoughts:
- there's a lot of crap in the box and it was annoying to find things. I'm in the process of organizing the components to make finding monsters and monster stats easier...with a big step of putting the counter in a plano type box with labels for each monster in alphabetical order and putting the stat cards in order also. 
- we played a couple things incorrectly but, I had effectively skimmed the rule book and we were all able to pick the basics up by just starting to play. We thought the modifier deck in the class box was what you used...not the standard decks. We also thought a short rest was picking up your discarded cards then randomly discarding one (instead of losing). Both these things made the game waaaay to easy, but we still had a hard time!!! 
- this game is addicting. The mechanics were simple and pleasing. As a group things were tense! We had a lot of trouble figuring out what approach to take and has some heated arguments! 
- this felt like dnd. The arguments, the game play, everything felt like a session of dnd. 
- it's now not surprising that there is such discussion about this game on bgg. For rpgers, this probably seems lame with not enough creative control over what is happening. For straight euro gamers, this is probably too complex with "not enough interesting choices" and "repetitive play". Both camps are going to war over how popular this thing is without realizing it hits a lot of buttons for people in the middle. For my group who enjoys a mid weight game and an rpg once in a while, this is perfect because nobody has to do any crazy prep! We can just bang out a dungeon or two over an evening. 

2/15/2018
- this game is addicting. 
- managing the game is veeery similar to dnd. The setup is annoying but will get better as I implement a good storage system.

I am really enjoying this. I love the card management mechanics here which are truly unique and add a different sort of puzzle to the standard dungeon crawl fare as you must weigh your options as sending cards to discard for a lesser affect means you can possibly get them back ...but getting a larger effect from them means they go to the lost pile and there is no getting them back. Run out of cards and you are exhausted and removed from the scenario.

The first scenario or two were quite a chore because there is so much here. There was a lot of back and forth flicking through rules books but I have to say the rule book is very good with a fairly substantial index and further reading references within the text. 

The story is good and moves along at a fairly brisk pace and we already feel our actions are actually having an affect and shaping the world. Each of the characters plays differently and the flavour text throughout is wonderful. 

It would be nice if there was a little variety in the scenarios rather than them all simply being kill everything...but it may develop that way.. we shall see :)

Status after 7 plays, so far from a final review. While it keeps all the pains of a dungeon crawler (tedious setup, sometimes grindy mission design) it excels at interesting decisions and game mechanics with quite different character design and a enthrolling world and story arch coupled with a motivating character progression.

Will it make Top 10? I am still torn on this one. Yes it is one of the most innovative designs out there for dungeon crawlers : replacing dice with cards adds so much depth to gameplay both with the character's abilities & the monsters' AI. Likewise the legacy/unlocking aspect is compelling enough to driven you through the next session.
BUT... It is probably too combat focused & with less variability I would like to see in the mission's goals. I hope fan/pro made scenarios will make it evolve for the better but as it is I can certainly relate to the grind argument. Perhaps I am no longer such a fan of dungeon crawlers mimicking action RPGs videogames? Makes me want to try Earth Reborn even more!
Great game nonetheless & a clear labour of love.

It's true. All of it.

I waited to have experienced enough games to pick my rating. The multi-player experience is a blast of storytelling and shared experience. And the solo version provides an amazing challenge. I am now set on the 'very hard' difficulty and Gloomhaven provides an experience that I have not been able to find in even highest-rate solo games, plus all the flavor of seeing your delicately tuned characters evolve and discover more.

Note : I am not really into Kickstarter hunting. This is the unbiased rating for the retail copy I got.

RATING: 7.5
So, the combat in this game is amazing. I love how the cards work as your stamina and all the choices the different combinations offer. Each character feels very different and the way the enemies work is great as well.

For the rest though the game does not really offer anything new. The map setup and scenarios feel exactly the same as Descent, The map tiles look identical to Descent, the shopping in between games and the character progression are also very standard.

The story itself doen't feel that interesting to me yet and I'm not really immersed in the story at all. The events in between scenarios feel pasted on and don't really affect the game that much. The legacy elements of the game are pretty underwhelming, it doesn't feel like I'm shaping the game, but just running along a scripted scenario. Ripping up cards and crossing of things permanently feels forced and I'm not going to do it to a 100+ Euro game.

One game to rule them all! I am so glad that it finally dethroned Pandemic: Legacy from BGG's No. 1 spot. :) The core battle system, which feels like a much-enhanced Mage-Knight-meets-Mice-&-Mystics,  hits all the sweet spots in terms of strategy, tension, variety, cooperation, and discovery. Even though obscuring the basic actions of your everyday dungeon crawler behind the multi-use cards results in an awkward initial experience, the system leads to a highly enjoyable explosion of tactical possibilities and puzzle-solving challenges.

And it does not stop there. This ridiculously-big box keeps throwing cool stuff at you, from eye-watering variety in playable characters, monster types, and unique scenarios to original encounters, meaningful choices, world-building events, and customization possibilities that make the world of Gloomhaven come to life on your table. And then there is the ability to have players jump in and out with straightforward re-balancing, to have concurrent questing parties, and to have solo, casuals and random playing modes. Childres is certainly The Grandmaster of game design for the sheer quality and quantity of gaming elements in his creation. I am hard-pressed to find legitimate negatives in this game, as it seems like not much could be changed without compromising one of its many great features... Ok, I found one: now the pain of not having enough time to play my games has doubled. :(

Valahogy annyira nem állt össze nekem ennek a játéknak a sikere. Nyilván nagyok az elvárások, ha egy játék második az összesített listán, és így könnyebb csalódni. Úgy látom hogy a játék zsenialitása a rengeteg küldetésben, sztoriban rejlik, ez értelemszerűen nem jött elő egy játék alatt, de megcsodáltuk, hogy mennyi minden várhatna még ránk. Egy scenario lejátszása nem okozott különösebben nagy élményt. Elég vontatott a játékmenet a rengeteg adminisztráció miatt, illetve ez a deck-kimerülős mechanika se az, ami a leginkább lázba tud engem hozni. Kicsit bántott még, hogy igen nehezen tervezhető egy-egy kör, mert az sorrend, ami kvázi véletlenszerűen alakul ki, mindent elronthat, amit terveztél. Így gyakoriak a totál fals körök, kirakott, de végre nem hajtható támadásokkal, gyógyításokkal. Ezt akár tematikusnak is lehet mondani, hiszen a harc hevében nem feltétlenül tudunk egymásra figyelni, de játszva inkább bosszantó érzés, pláne ha egy fals akció után várhatsz 15 percet mire újra sorra kerülsz.
A doboz hatalmas, rengeteg a tartalom, aminek egyik része hasznos, de egy jó részét szinte egyszerhasználatos tokenek teszik ki.

RATING: 6
It's an ok game but it's way over hyped. Definitely not the miracle game everyone is raving about. I'm looking at the ratings in disbelief, there must be something I'm missing here. I love dungeon crawlers so typically I'd be the first to rate this a 10.

The campaign portion lacks severely in terms of events, which are laughable for most part, with obvious choices. In the long run there’s almost no incentive to take the ‘bad’ option so it all feels scripted. Thematically this is no better than standard D&D. Classes and races seem to be the same in practice, only different in terminology. Scenario design is really poor, with 80% of them about killing everything on the map, leaving most games feeling sameish.

The meat of the game, the tactical combat is a good in terms of player agency, monsters and characters diversity but I'm not a big fan of the main mechanic, deck exhaustion. I get it mechanically and thematically, it's not a fun thing to do. It feels like an increasing slog and it gets repetitive very fast. Going back to redo a scenario because you ran out of cards or luck in the previous attempt is indescribably boring. This is particularly frustrating in scenarios where it's obvious bouts of good draws are needed to win. Overall, I much prefer Mage Knight, where your experience of the game ramps up as you play the game. Or Descent, where the game progresses whether you won the scenario or not. Speaking of Descent, I don't see the combat decks as a vast improvement over dice, which are faster to resolve while providing similar results.

I’m perplexed to see how many people praise it for it’s euro qualities. Couldn’t be further from the truth. The battle decks make it so that any plans you can possibly come up with can be completely undone by a bad draw. The “miss” cards actually resets the deck so instead of providing smoother results, it makes battle just as swingy as dice. I hated them from the first play, but I understand that without them, there aren’t that many exciting moments, which is probably why I’m not that interested in the game. 

I may be wrong judging the game by the first couple of scenarios but at 2 hours average per attempt, I don't feel the need to try any more.

A dungeon crawler in a world you can alter, with atypical characters, branching progression and very interesting card play.  Each turn is a puzzle and you are racing the turn clock, no action can be wasted.  Mechanisms feel thematic but also puzzly.  
Production is great, especially for the price.  Box is HUGE.  Massive amount of cardboard standees and cards and counters, like 25lbs worth!
Keeping track of everything feels procedural and unwieldy, but its all worth it.  EPIC.
Can be slow playing because of wordy cards if players are AP prone.  Any game suffers when it slows down, and Gloomhaven can do so.

I don't yet own Gloomhaven, and have been playing with a friend's copy. If you're at all interested in long-term, party-based RPGs, Gloomhaven is like mainlining adrenaline. 

It's been about two or three weeks, and I've sunk 20+ hours, downloaded two companion apps, watched several videos and read the rulebook over about a dozen times. Gloomhaven isn't a game you play, it's a city in which you live, grow and progress, with innumerable secrets to unlock that you don't dare spoil for yourself or others.

If I died tomorrow, my two regrets, in order would be: 1. Not being married to my wonderful girlfriend, and 2. Not finishing my Gloomhaven campaign.

I've had to lower the ratings of several other games after playing this.

Gloomhaven is absolutely the single-greatest and most inspired board game I've ever played. It has succeeded in bringing my wife and I together, finally, in the genre of fantasy that I've loved since I picked up my first novel. The breadth of this undertaking, the sheer audacity and creativity, is unmatched in board games today. I will forever remember my experiences with this game, the late nights spent with my wife agonizing over the wonderfully deep tactical experiences it constantly asks of you, with nothing but fondness. We will be backing any reprint just to have another copy of the game for later on in our life when we wish to recreate the story again, perhaps that time with grown children to share it with.

Thank you, Isaac. This game is a masterpiece.

RATING: 7.5
The indie Kickstarter sensation of 2017. Epic-in-scope campaign game by Isaac Childres. Interesting game mechanisms with hundreds of hours of play where you will play, level up, and retire multiple characters over the course of a 50+ scenario campaign. Unique fantasy world with decent story but feels a bit twee at times. More fundamentally, a number of drawbacks prevent this from being a great game for me... It's a huge grind -- most scenarios take 2-3 hours to play, which is too long in my book for the small amount of progress you make per scenario. Scenarios run long primarily because the combat resolution phase is fiddly and takes a while to play out. Most scenarios involving defeating all enemies, sometimes a big bad, which gets repetitive after while. In those missions you are usually racing to defeat everyone before your hand of cards run out, which means you have to be frugal with your most powerful cards as you play. (Unlike Mage Knight you won't gain any new cards as you play a scenario.) This can get particularly frustrating when you can see that you don't have the cards you need to complete the scenario about three turns out. (You are forced to replay missions you fail.) And don't get me started on setup and take down - H U G E box, hundreds of cards and tokens and fifty odd map tiles are a total pain in the ass manage. In sum, an impressive achievement but held back by repetitiveness, and an unreasonable time commitment per unit of progress for most players.

RATING: 8
This looks like an incredible game. At first I didn't want to invest in it due to Legacy thing and permanent stickers. I'll play it like it is because it looks incredible. One could get extra stickers sheets and probably use a plastic overlay if they wanted to spare the Gloomhaven board. There are 95 scenarios in this game when playing in campaign mode, and it might take you more than once to conquer a scenario. Will you play 95 scenarios? This game will be valuable for playing for many many sessions.

- Punching out everything and organizing stuff is a real challenge
- It's one big fiddly game to get setup the first time, but will probably get easier with experience playing it. You have to dig out the tiles, and monster standies, but part of the fun is forming your party and picking your characters. 
- The rule book is really well organized, if you use the back of the rule book to look up icons, they'll point to the pages of interest in a lot of cases
- Game play is brutally fun. The choices in each and every play of the cards is amazing
- Playing solo is a blast, complex, and very thinky. 
- It's easy to make mistakes
- Nobody likes the tableau tracking for experience and hit points, but they'll be fixing it in the second printing on Kickstarter. I am using the spinner wheels from D-Day Dice to track these and it works OK 
- This game is a monster like none I've ever experienced so far. I can see that I may never finish playing it, and still this is only season 1, there is a second expansion in the works. 

What I don't Like : There's too much stuff to track and setup with this game. If I wait too long between games, I have to really dig through the rule book to refresh myself. I'm making mistakes by overlooking things during play as well.

I only have 4 plays under my belt so far, but I think it's been sufficient to get an idea of the general slant of the campaign experience. The parts I enjoy are mainly legacy-level and the use of delayed consequences, the slow reveal of scenario chains, sidequests, simple Crossroads cards events, and world state changes. The legacy conceit works very well with this genre.

However, I'm still not quite sure where I stand with the core of the scenario play. It seems to take the concept of a D&D 4th edition session, deconstructs it down to micro-events spread across dual purpose cards, then re-assembles it into something where you spend every initiative round frowning at cards, deciding which to chain together, which will be ok to discard for the next X rounds, which will be good to burn for the rest of the scenario at certain points, table-talk about who moves where, who can infuse the battlefield with an element that someone else can use with their card, etc, etc... all for a single round in a skirmish with a handful of bandit fodder. 

It sounds interesting on paper but it can be taxing, especially if taken as an experience of playing a board game emulating an RPG-in-a-box. Looking at it from that angle, I feel like the freedom and playfulness, and straight up velocity of the genre is pared down to cardplay that feels oddly restrictive, fussy, and slow despite the agency that it provides in the game (and those cards do allow you to do some really cool stuff). It's like you have to squeeze through this gauntlet of boardgamey analysis, just to pull something off that would have taken quick clearance from a DM and the roll of a d20. But I think I have to resist looking at it from that angle because I suspect that the smaller narratives being churned through game mechanics is exactly what a board gamer coming at this genre from their own angle may expect. Case in point, there are tons of Mage Knight fans. I'm not one of those fans, for somewhat similar reasons as I'm conflicted about this game. This takes that crunchiness of systems propelling simple diegetic events and extends it, almost obscenely, across potentially years worth of play.

It's kind of a baffling game for me, at this point. It's something to be marveled at, but it's also a commitment that I'm not sure I'm going to find anywhere outside of solo play. My game group is most definitely not ready for this, and my son, who normally eats up this style of card play, is turned off by endlessly shuffled, swingy modifier cards (effectively a mutable d20, disguised to assuage die aversion) that can easily [i]tank[/i] an hours-long scenario. So yeah, there it is on my table: a sea of solo campaign play, but also a brain burn. I'm not sure how often I want those two aspects joined together.

I was sceptical of all the positive reviews, thinking that the hype bumped up the ratings. 

After 8 plays solo and one 3 player I can honestly say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. It deserves a 10! Yes it's fiddly and time consuming to set up and tear down, but the immersion into the world, character development, story choices, great card play mechanisms, and the immensity of villans, maps, scenarios, items, and fighting styles make this a winner! Hype is boring. This game is the real deal!

Just finished playing the first scenario with 3 friends, two of whom do NOT like board games, or card games. We were all blown away, and cannot wait to get together again to continue building this world and exploring the gameplay. Everything about this game design sings to me. I have not had this much fun in a long time. We played during a Superbowl party, and everyone else (gamers & non-gamers alike) were far more interested in what we were doing than what was on TV.

I've played 10 scenarios so far. Gloomhaven is a good tactical game, with an engaging world and character progression. However, I'm only rating it an 8 and not a 10 because of how fiddly the rules are. It takes even a dedicated board game nerd many rereads of the rulebook and FAQ and many plays to get to the point of not making rules mistakes. The core rules are pretty simple, but there are so many exceptions and edge cases. Nevertheless, the complexity does make the game have excellent balance, and excellent difficulty scaling.

After only a handful of sessions I was hooked.  Gloomhaven brings the strategy elements of good D&D encounters to a the table in a GM-free format with a story and meaningful choices to tie it all together.  Equipped with new-age combat mechanics and a wide array of classes/missions/rewards to choose from, this game makes an excellent edition to the collections of the gamer's enjoying 'legacy' style games.

I love the feeling of staring at a long term fantasy campaign that I don't have to DM.  After 2x through the first scenario I'm looking forward to jumping in with a regular group.  The combat is interesting and tactical so far, though it seems like the 'low luck' variant is essential, at least in a 2p party.  Progression might be on the slow side.  The amount of content in the box is generous to say the least. That box is ridiculously big!   The packaging is smart and intriguing; really interested to start unlocking stuff and making campaign decisions.

Three scenarios down in a 4p party and we are all having a blast.  Leveling up is satisfying but I would have preferred leveling every other scenario instead of every third.

It started off as 10 for me but gradually I got extremely bored with the combat system and the fact that it was taking several hours for a single combat. It also felt abstracted and more of a puzzle than a dungeon crawl or adventure game which is why it's dropped quite low in my list. I really enjoy the world building and the story elements though.

My excitement has survived contact with an actual play session. I can't stop thinking about this and the future I will have with it. This isn't just a great game, it's a great thing that has happened to my life. I'm not sure the boiled down nuts and bolts are that best going (they're good, but not worth a 10). What is worth a 10 is the sheer scale and potential of the thing. I was a Heroquest kid. Gloomhaven is era-defining.

Was dragged into playing this mess. PERFECT example of a board game that is better off played on a computer/PC game (Baldur's Gate, or any other RPG). Boring beyond belief and tons of work just to get characters/creatures simply moving around. Playing this is like stepping backwards in time, which I suppose explains it's popularity. Lots of adults getting a chance at revisiting their childhood days of D&D. Also, ugly cardboard standees in an era of miniatures... Bah. There are just too many other games to play.

This game pretty much obliterates any other game in the genre of co-op mini games vs the box.  

There are so many things about this game that cleans up that formula that I hope other games in this genre and the 1 vs many genre.

ON TOP of that the heart of this game is a brilliant hand management game that is so satisfying.  This I don't want everyone to copy but I do hope this trend continues where there is a more robust game engine driving these games.

RATING: 5.5
Only one scenario played, but was very impressed with the design and can recommend it for anyone interested, despite not rating it higher personally. The legacy mechanic makes for a lot of mystery and unknown, and yet it's tuned to make scenarios have some difficulty. With good hand management you can extend your actions quite a bit, but even then, if you hit some bad luck, it should challenge you.

If this type of game was more to my liking, I'd probably rate it 9 or 10. As it was, it struck me a light-medium tactical exercise that wasn't terribly difficult. I think our characters may have had better than normal synergy (Brute plus Tinkerer healing and attacks, plus another magic attacker). Even still, if you play your character even a little, there can be brinkmanship in how you play, making you less effective in the combats.

I feel like I've only scratched the surface. Rating is quite preliminary, but I'm not sure if I'll continue with it, so dropping in my comments while they're fresh in my mind.

This game is created by a genius designer. There needs to be much more thought given to giving the introductory gamer a quick, intense experience without so much setup.
This is the publisher's job. The micromanaging of movement and hit points does not come close to the fast paced Dungeons and Dragons experience of my youth, but that is just my preference. I know many who LOVE this game.

Great and amazing game deserving of it's title of 'DnDing without a DM'. Combat and role play mechanics absorb you into the world, while being a co-op game with hidden actions that helps prevent quarterbacking jackassery. It's a bit hard to learn all of your actions and combinations of actions at first, but once you ease yourself into your character/class and start using it effectively, the game gets even MORE fun. There's enough GAME in here to last you for years.

That being said there are a couple of (rather minor, but nagging) issues. The pop-out cardboard pieces are rather low quality (pop out the pieces towards the flat side, not the indented side to help prevent the thin, cheap paper from tearing into the piece). I haven't opened up all of the miniatures to check if this is normal, but my Brute miniature came with an awfully warped base, making it wobble in place like a rocking chair. A slight bump to the table would cause the miniature to fall over, causing much frustration. All of this is a far cry from the Fantasy Flight standard I love. The gold and item pick up mechanics being rather annoying as well. You have to end your turn or use one of your actions picking up multiple pieces of loot instead of attacking and helping your team, as well as you not being able to ever trade items or gold with other players. If we're in the same goddamn party and you need 5 gold to get a crucial item that will help you survive or do damage, how the hell am I just going to say no? Or if I have an item I don't have a use for, why can't I just hand it off to someone else? I solved this by house ruling trading into the game, but you can only ask for enough money to buy an item and equip immediately. 

This is not much of a complaint as it is a warning, but when playing with 3-4 players, it's easy to have your plans completely ruined being late in the turn order. This issue is more prominent when playing characters with slower actions such as Cragheart. A large part of this game is being flexible and rolling with the punches, this isn't a game for you if you don't like that.

Even with most of this review being negative, because I'm a bit of a pessimist, you know the game is something special when I'm still giving it a 9/10. Although I'd urge you to be patient, as the prices they're going for at the moment are just way too insane.

Heavily overrated - campagin mode seems to be fun and very, very absorbing. However, the mechanics how all scenarios play out are very, very disappointing - at the beginning of each one, you need to make choices which will affect each mission without enough information on enemies, your character etc. Either you will be out of resources in the end, or you have them too many. This might be appealing as optimization game, but this is not what I expect from dungeon crawler-style game

Finally, the co-op dungeon crawl of my dreams! My formative years included countless sessions of D&D. For years I've wanted to revisit those fond memories in the context of modern board gaming. Earlier attempts (e.g. Mage Knight, Descent, Mansions of Madness) fell completely flat with my family. In sharp contrast, and as the ultimate endorsement, they are all *loving* Gloomhaven. The depth of the combat system is unprecedented and edge-of-our-seats engaging. Videogame-esque mechanics like dropping coins and unlockable content make instant sense to my kids. The storytelling, character development, and persistent world overlays a sense of purpose and intrigue. Setup and teardown are bit of a bear and play time is on the long side for us, but thus far such imperfections have been a minor and manageable downside that we're more than happy to navigate. The biggest problem at the moment: maximum players is 4, and we can have as many as 7 who want to play.

A brilliantly designed system of gameplay and an absolutely engrossing experiencing -- the hours just fly by as I try to "solve" the puzzle tjat is each scenario -- that leaves me thinking about the game constantly when I am not playing it.

RATING: 9
Great game. The combat and action mechanism reminds me of Mage Knight for some reason even though on closer comparison, it's hard to find anything common between them. I also like the card deck for attacks which is easier to modify and expand than a system based on dice.
The game also has a great strategic element to it on how the party works together and what actions people do and how do they support each other. Cragheart (level 1) for example has plenty of AoE damage attacks but cannot attack the same target multiple times. This means that for him to be at maximum efficiency the enemies have to be clustered. And to optimize this, the group has to think of initiative and movement to draw the enemies to the correct place. And this brings up another challenge as the rules forbid people to explicitly say what cards they're playing and what actions they're doing. 
Overall, a very enjoyable game.

Not too far into the campaign yet, but I have two separate parties greatly enjoying their time in it so far.  All six of us players feel like the game finally captures the GM-less D&D experience we've been looking for after too many years.  We're completely done with soulless and wimpy-strategy dungeon crawls for a long time.  Also, for anyone who has looked into Kingdom Death: Monster and decided the cost was too high, or it was too gory, etc., and are sad they couldn't make the jump into a rich campaign experience, this is what you need instead.  And, that's coming from someone who owns and has played the base KD:M through multiple times.  Amazing job, Isaac!

RATING: 7
Good, willing to play, but don't love it. Way better than D&D, some nice mechanisms, and scenario balance seems very good. But the feeling of progression is slow and the time investment is huge. Our plays have averaged around 4 hours per scenario with 3-4 players. It just takes quite a long time to select cards each round, and while I love the amount of choice and wouldn't change it, I would adjust the feeling of reward that players receive for that investment.

Based on our plays so far (5), there are about 500 hours of content in the box. Like most games with lots of content, I feel the designer assumes you will love their creation as much as they do. Therefore the scale of action is such that players spend as much time as possible in the world. But IMHO, less would have been more here, with content better staged as separate acts with a well-defined story (tension-release) structure that was more rewarding. Gaining a few gold tokens and maybe 20 XP per scenario may be balanced for the design, but it feels glacial.

Finally, after 5 scenarios, I haven't found much of a hook to the world of Gloomhaven and its inhabitants, and while the stereotypical fantasy tropes aren't present, the ones that are just haven't grabbed me. Maybe I'm in the minority and we'll see where it goes, but the trick to the Lord of the Rings e.g. was that it was the *world* that was the main character, not elves, hobbits, dwarves, etc. So I'm hoping that the world of Gloomhaven will grow to be more unique and be worthy of the time spent here.

Smart design decisions help to elevate and distinguish Gloomhaven from other, similar dungeon-crawlers.  The characters are unique and distinctive and gameplay feels truly co-operative.  Watching the world slowly open up and reveal more of itself after nearly every scenario is also a treat.   Every scenario so far has been a roller coaster of emotions in which we managed to snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat at the last moment.  I thought games in this style needed dice to generate drama and randomness, but Gloomhaven proves that isn't the case.    

Some components feel a bit too small, thin or flimsy.  The number of components seems a bit excessive (some tokens are rarely used or not used at all, and there are too many map tiles) and organizing everything is a game in itself.  The artwork is colourful, consistent and fresh.  The setting tries to be original, but often falls back on convenient fantasy cliches.

Kickstarter package arrived. First impressions:
1) Wow, it's big and heavy and just full of stuff.
2) Punching the cardboard and sleeving the cards takes forever.
3) The cardboard pieces and tokens look nice but the glue that holds the three layers together is not consistent. Some pieces fall apart and require additional gluing which takes even more time.
4) All of this WILL NOT fit back into the box, even though it's enormous.

I will refrain from giving it a score until I've played a couple of scenarios.

EDIT:

Around 10 games later I'll have to say this is actually excellent. The gaming group has to be into co-op games though and I know plenty of people who rather play against people than with them. With the right people it is a great adventure. Advancing your character is very addictive.

POSITIVES:
1. Well-designed classes provide uniqueness and flavor
2. Character progression feels rewarding
3. Damage modifier deck enhances character flavor and progression; also my favorite part of the game
4. Hand management rewards well-planned combos and teamwork
5. Well-designed Monster AI decks and abilities make the monsters feel extremely thematic
6. Elemental infusion and how it works really encourages teamwork during a scenario
7. Team Lingo during scenarios (read: Hanabi) feels extremely thematic (and hilarious at times)
8. Battle Goals make each scenario feel different and provides a nice challenge each time
9. Town Prosperity feels rewarding when leveling up
10. Scenarios have great flavor text before and after, and really gives meaning as you play through them
11. Scales extremely well between 1 to 4 players
12. Is supported by both the designer and the fanbase, so even when you run out of scenarios to do in the box, there will be plenty online
13. Comes with so much content that you can use said content for your own fan-made scenarios, or even other games or RPGs like DnD

Even though this game is a 10/10 for me, there are definitely flaws. No game is perfect.

NEGATIVES:
1. Characters progress slowly. This in part makes character progression more rewarding. However, it is *definitely* slow, and you can expect 2 to 3 scenarios before you see your character level up or gain a perk. This is NOT good for players who enjoy a *constant* feeling of progression. Note that this is NOT a problem for Solo Play, because you'll most often than not be improving one of your 2-4 characters that you're controlling. For Group Play, I suggest allowing an additional checkmark per scenario, while increasing the scenario level to balance out the increased amount of perks.
2. Town Prosperity levels slowly, and sometimes randomly. The random and slow gain in prosperity makes Gloomhaven feel less dynamic and more static, as you'll come back to Town seeing the old items still for sale.
3. The Town is not as exciting as it should be. City Events are great, but there's only so much a single card can do to make you look forward to your *next* Town visit. A good Town phase should make you look forward to the next Town phase; see: Shadows of Brimstone, Frontier Town expansion. A suggestion to fix this would be to implement SoB Town Phases - have the concept of a "Day", where each character can decide which one shop to visit. Certain items would be available only in certain shops. Additionally, after each "Day", a City Event would occur. The amount of days that you can spend in Gloomhaven can be a formula: AverageLevel(Party) + Reputation(Party), with the minimum of 1 day for the output.
4. Party reputation is not great. The fact is that your party reputation will not go up or go down consistently. This is (randomly) affected by what scenarios you do and what city and road events you draw, and often times you won't even know until the outcome is read. You cannot plan to have your party to be the most reputable bunch, or to be the worst scumbags.

RATING: 2
If there's one thing I can say about Gloomhaven, it's that this game is ambitious... very ambitious. It's probably the most ambitious dungeon crawl adventure game I've ever played... and I'm not saying that as an accomplishment. 

Gloomhaven is like combining D&D with filling out your income tax returns, except you have to use cardboard disks to do all your calculating instead of a calculator. This game combines elements from different genres into a Frankenstein's Monster of dungeon crawl action. I've never been more bored playing a game than during our introduction to Gloomhaven.

The only fun we had during the intro scenario were the few moments of levity we extracted out of the shared misery of painstakingly referencing and re-referencing the rules for the overly complicated combat mechanics over the course of two masochistic hours. We spent more time saying "what the hell does this card do?" and trying to keep track of who had what initiative than we did resolving anything that actually progressed the game to a conclusion.

This is the Star Wars prequels of adventure games. You're force-fed a vision of what an adventure is supposed to be like with none of the fun of an adventure. Your decision tree revolves around poorly designed cards that often resulted in our players just moving two spaces and punching a guy because that was often better than the abilities printed on the card... or maybe they didn't, I really don't know what the rest of my group was doing most of the time because I was so bored after spending an hour killing six Bandits that I checked out. I honestly don't know how this dumpster fire of a game got published and I sure can't fathom how it climbed so high on this website. 

This is what happens when a game doesn't go through a traditional design process; conceptually this game is fantastic, in practice it's every idea one man ever had thrown into a single box and fused into something resembling a game. "No" is not a dirty word and this game would have been a lot better if someone had learned to say it at any point in the design process.

As a game store retailer, I feel obligated to call all of the customers I sold this game to and apologize for taking their money.

Rating after four sessions. Gameplay seems to actually live up to the hype. However already „normal“ mode is very tough. this game is progressing relatively slowly which can lead to a drop of interest after half a dozen of plays (there are 90+ Szenarios, don‘t expect to be upleveled to the max after only 5 plays). Actually upleveling by XP doesn’t work for me (when your character dies you start again with 0 XP, so accumulating 45+ XP for upleveling means you have to be lucky). But then there is the Prosperity progress which allows you just the same to uplevel, disregarding your XP.

I’d really love to play this more! All that is said about this game is pretty well deserved: it is immense, new at every turn, tactical, with a long setup and slow going in the dungeons. I find it pretty relaxing to slog through the scenarios and trying to coordinate at the best of our ability. Not for everyone but certainly a masterpiece and mightily ambitious game that deserves attention.

UPDATE
Ok I'm really digging this game, it is something I didn't do in a long time. I really would like to play this game even with all its faults I keep going back. Best bang for you buck ever. I hope they'll Kickstart a third printing.

A simply incredible game.  On one level, it's a dungeon crawler, but the mechanics of battle using the cards, combined with "resting" and the variable levels/difficulty of the dungeons makes for every scenario being interesting and frequently quite challenging.

Where the game shines though (and gets a 10) is in the campaign.  Unlocking new scenarios, advancing along your personal quest, interacting with the larger world and seeing the city of Gloomhaven grow and improve (or not!).  The non-Tolkien nature of the world is also a breath of fresh air.  Very fun and highly recommended.

Lots of really nice features in the game like variety, replayability, depth, good stories, unique characters, etc.

There is one big drawback though, lots of annoying procedures, some of which should have not survived proper play-testing.
All that shuffling and reshuffling is killing the game. You waste so much time doing that that your scenario takes from 5 to 15 minutes longer (depending on the size of the scenario).
Replacing the eight monster cards with a table you roll onto would have maybe removed the surprise of what is behind he next card, but it would have removed lots of useless procedures.

I have nothing against heavy games but as long as they use mechanics and not procedures. Because when to do procedures, you are not playing, as for mechanics, you do things because of an action you did. For example, Agricola is a heavy medium game that has mechanics and just two small procedures each turn (turning turn card and adding things to the board) which does not bog game play much. In Gloomhaven, you shuffle your deck, you shuffle the monster's deck, the other players shuffle their decks, you must draw a monster card for each monster type, you must draw and attack card for each monster miniature, you must draw a card for each attack card of your character, the other players do the same, etc.

This card system belongs to another age, the 1980s.

I am certain that we can figure out a much more efficient way to play Gloomhaven that would reduce the time scenarios take to finish by a good 20%. Not to mention diminishing the box's content and weight (thus reducing its cost so it will sell more).

Our group of game designers and our coaches hates procedures. There are too many small rules too.

Unless streamlined, like Arkham Horror this game would be best as a video game than a board game right now.

Without the heavy procedures and small rules, this game is a 10/10.

Gloomhaven is decent, but I think the time investment required to play a campaign is better spent on other games.  In particular, I would get more enjoyment playing a game of Mage Knight, experiencing the whole level-up/treasure thing in 4 hours, rather than playing 12 hours of Gloomhaven to go up a level or two.  Mage Knight also has significantly more compelling card play choices than Gloomhaven; as your deck gets exhausted you have less choices to make, where in Mage Knight your deck gets more interesting as you play.

This is amazing, and the definitive campaign-style fantasy combat game. The scenarios are well-calibrated (challenging but doable), rewards are tough to earn but within sight, and the amount of stuff to do is extraordinary. 
The core cardplay, which I falsely perceived as giving a sort of timer to the game that I generally don't prefer, is really clever and encourages interesting tradeoffs that culminate in a cinematic orgy of powerful effects.

Gloomhaven reminds me of my childhood when I played Hero Quest with my brothers and parents.

Basically, it is a lot like Hero Quest, but with much better game mechanics, better story, longer gameplay, characters which really play differently, etc.

Of course you could make a few things better like somehow magically squeezing in more role playing elements, but this game is so much fun and totally worth the money (around 100 EUR) for both the material and the fun we had playing.

You can play a simple character with few options in battle like Brute or you can also go for the other starting characters with a lot more options.

RATING: 10
I tend to be generous with rating games, however this is my first and only 10 rating.  I had always thought that when a game deserving of a 10 rating came along, it would be obviously apparent.   That game is Gloomhaven.

I'm currently nine missions in, and my enjoyment continues to grow with each character upgrade, sticker applied, and envelope opened.  Perfect use of legacy mechanics, which are constructive, rather than destructive.  At first, I was afraid that the slow pace of upgrades would turn me off, but after playing, the pace feels just right.  I love being able to modify your attack modifier deck, in addition to leveling up and getting new card abilities.  With so many different paths to upgrade your character, your party, and the city of Gloomhaven itself, it feels like you are always making some kind of progress.

This is as close as you can get to D&D in a box, with no DM or advanced preparation required.  Arguably a better combat system than D&D as well, and every decision made feels like it was a difficult choice.  I've never been a huge fan of dungeon crawlers, as I had always felt like if i had enough people to play a dungeon crawler, that we should just play D&D. This game does what it does well enough that I feel it scratches a different itch, for me.

The rule that you cannot communicate specifics of what cards you will be playing to simulate the uncertainty of battle is fantastic, as it eliminates "quarterbacking", and sets up situations where you need to adapt how you perform the actions on your selected cards.  It's incredibly satisfying when your original plans fall apart due to monster or other player actions, only to find that you can use your selected cards in an alternative way to have an effective turn anyways.

Minor complaints would be component issues with the character boards, which we have replaced with alternative HP and XP trackers.  Tracking monster health and effects can be a little fiddly when there are lots of monsters present.  Also, setup/teardown can be a bit long, but after repeated plays, the rest of the group has learned how to set up and pack up everything, making it faster each time.

Thank you Isaac, Gloomhaven is a masterpiece, and is the tabletop game which all others will be judged against.

Gloomhaven is a fine game. I'm giving it a 3 in part because I think it's highly overrated.  I don't normally use BGG's official rating system, but here it applies. I don't want to play this game. I don't have the time, energy or inclination to play a game of this that's so repetitive. It represents for me some of the worst elements of this hobby. In order for me to play this game I'd have to force myself into an existing play group that meets at regularly. Because I can't meet that often I'm a guest at the table.  This is not a game that's good for new people to join the table. This is not a game I can play just occasionally.  This is a game for "serious gamers" who have more time than I have. I'd wager this game is for people who have more time than most people. I was okay playing this once, but it left a real sour taste in my mouth. I'd say this game pushed me away from other gamers - both in the real world and here on BGG.  That this game is now ranked number 1 tells me I don't share a lot with a large percentage of BGG users.

Wasn't playing the correct rules at first, then I loved it. By far the worst part is the setting up and tearing down, you're looking at like 30 min for that combined. But the fact that you can customize your own deck, level up skills in a way, the over-arching narrative has so many paths to go and choose from. Lots of play value and lots of fun. It's actually thrilling and fulfilling to get through a scenario, similar to Pandemic Legacy feeling of beating a mission.

Edit: After retiring my first character, the game is keeps getting better and better! Upped my ranking to 9.8, only short of the 10 due to setup. But man this game is fun and the artwork and diversity of the characters are amazing!

One of the best games I've had the pleasure to play.

I ordered my own copy as soon as they became readily available and will be starting a second campaign with another group later this week. Gloomhaven is an incredible experience, just be prepared for the INSANE amount of punch outs, cards, tokens and legacy components. Not a bad thing, but I had to go buy three tackle boxes from Walmart just to hold it all!

It's over 90 scenarios, has a well written epic story, amazing art, road and city events that let you make decisions that change the world, so many classes that all play completely differently, etc. I can't believe this game exists! Its probably on the Mechs vs Minion level in terms of value!

A unique game based on careful hand management, with tons of content. The game is a great accomplishment. I don't expect I will ever play a full campaign to completion, but the combat system is worth it even for the occasional one-off game. 

This has been compared to Mage Knight for solo play, and while it's indeed very good, the variety and options available during a single encounter are nowhere near those in a single game of Make Knight. 

With all the bookkeeping and the clunkiness of storage and setup, I think this would be better as a computer/tablet game than a board game.

This is the way I wanted dice-rolling campaign games to feel, that my choices in combat really meant something. I love the depth of action choices and how you have to plan those choices so as to keep options open in future turns.

Rated an '8' more based on potential than my one play.  So, it comes the closest to reminding me of my favourite video game Dragon Age which is very exciting.  BUT to get started was so many bits to organize.  So many bits.  And so much time to figure out the rules.  So very fiddly.  It was hours before we got to play the first game and it took hours to get through the first game.  

Played a 2nd game (actually the first scenario a 2nd time).  Went much better overall.  Still had to refer to the rules A.LOT.  Using the cards is both much more interesting than rolling dice, and incredibly AP inducing.  So far, I would say it has probably killed Descent for me.  We'll see how it goes over the next few plays.
PS: as compared to other games, line of sight rules are a breeze and I really appreciate the designer not taking the opportunity to add a PITA factor.

Fourth game in  and its really growing on me.  Love the tension and how it feels super epic when we manage to pull off a win.  Very satisfying game.

The more I have played this game the more I seem to like it. The hand management makes the dungeon crawling and combat tense and satisfying. The character customization is excellent with tons of equipment, lots of cards to build your hand, and ways to adjust your combat deck. Battle goals provide variability to every scenario, and the career goals give you a sense of purpose. Since starting this campaign, I have spent every single day thinking about playing the next scenario.

Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for travelling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.

Should you get Gloomhaven? Yes. Yes. [b]Hell yes![/b] Gloomhaven really is [i]that[/i] good. Gloomhaven is the dungeon crawling board game I've wanted since I first rolled-to-move in Heroquest 24 years ago. I don't think I'll ever touch my multiple boxes of Descent again, which is bittersweet to say the least, and a bit depressing considering how much money I spent on it. Gloomhaven is one of four games I've rated a [b]10[/b].

One reason I know Gloomhaven is special is that a friend I game with is obsessed with it, and he didn't even know it existed until about a month ago. He doesn't follow board game news and doesn't even have a BGG account and is thus unswayed by the massive hypetrain barreling through the board gaming world right now. He [b]dreamed[/b] about Gloomhaven. [i]I[/i] don't even dream about board games. He messaged me repeatedly trying to convince me to play more often (sure, just let me [b]abandon my wife and kids[/b] and I'll get right on that!) and bounced ideas off me how he could change his character's deck. He doesn't buy board games. He's backing the reprint Kickstarter.

There are some [b]downsides[/b] to Gloomhaven:

- It takes a long time to set it up and clean it up again. Solution: have an entire room dedicated to Gloomhaven. Buy or rent a new place if necessary.

- Gloomhaven has lots of tiny cardboard chits that have to constantly be manipulated. Solution: attach an extra cybernetic arm with tiny fingers ideal for fiddly bits.

- Gloomhaven has an FAQ longer than the United States legal code. Solution: study the rules like you studied for your final exams. That's right, get drunk the night before and say, "Fuck it, we'll do it live!"

- Gloomhaven requires (nay, [b]demands[/b]) that you sticker the map board and class decks, and that you destroy encounter cards when you're finished with them. Solution: get over it, you didn't complain that your stupid anniversary dinner cost more than Gloomhaven and that was [b]just one meal[/b].

But my [i]oh my[/i] does that all [b]fall by the wayside[/b] when you're deep into a scenario and trying to coordinate with your friends how the hell you're going to kill that boss with 48 hit points and HOLD UP what's that shiny treasure over there?! A Ring of SKULLS? And then you do the Vermling happy dance that you learned three scenarios ago on your way to the dungeon.

The joy when you pick your shield and retaliate ability cards when you're fully surrounded, knowing that your enemies will bounce off your shields and die to your scathing retribution. The agony when you realize that the enemies drew an initiative card faster than even exists in your own deck and they move in for the kill before you can raise your shields.

That moment when you think all hope is lost and we were so close, and wait, you can still play that card that recovers your lost cards? We got this!

The anticipation when you go to check out the side mission that you unlocked but realize that you can't go there because you haven't learned how to breathe underwater yet.

[b]Gloomhaven[/b] is life. That's the message I sent to a friend earlier tonight when he asked if I was available or if I was busy with my weekly Gloomhaven session. Of course I'm playing Gloomhaven every chance I get. I'm disappointed he even asked.

Gloomhaven played the game of thrones and decapitated the competition.

Four sessions in, and almost every time I've felt both pressed for time and overpowering. Still working on "communication" with teammates without communicating. I've run into several times when my plans have fallen through, mostly in a good way. Some luck, some bad luck, makes the game both hard, easy and incredibly fun. It's part puzzle, part communication exercise, and lots and lots of fantasy campaign fun with stuff to explore.

Kickstarted. Standee version.

WOW. I can't emphasize enough how amazing this game is. Best game of 2017 for me I'm pretty sure even though the first quarter isn't even over. This is like a dream come true, I couldn't have asked for better. It's like Skyrim the board game. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!

#1 BEST Dungeon crawl
#1 BEST Legacy game
#1 BEST Cooperative game

Also one of my SO's favorite games.

Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can't wait to play some more. I haven't played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it's a bit too long (I've played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I'd need to try it again just to be sure.

Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we "finished" the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I'm pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting. Waiting for an expansion!

Gloomhaven tries to add depth and strategy to the typical dice-chucking dungeon crawler.  I respect that a lot.  Choosing your 2 action cards each round from your personal deck is interesting.  The scripted enemy movement feels somewhat clunky, however.

In my opinion, Gloomhaven is the Taylor Swift of boardgames. Popular doesn’t mean that it’s good. Even by setting aside the mountain of hype, this game just feels like the epitome of quantity over quality. I come from a background of computer RPG games of the likes of Baldur's Gate and I can see how someone not familiar with those games, can find this game thrilling but if you like the idea of turn based combat, leveling up your character and progressing in a story, just play those games instead. Once we strip all the fluff around Gloomhaven, all that is left is a boring, repetitive and unbalanced card management game. All you really do in this game is simply looking through your deck of abilities and execute rules mindlessly. You can't be too strategic and plan ahead and you also can't take risks because the attack modifier is too unpredictable. Ironically, in this case, the luck component prevents you from taking risks, unless you don't care for losing, of course. Ultimately, the game is endlessly repetitive and boring. Having to look through your deck is frustrating, having to operate the enemies is annoying, having to keep track of the damage and debuffs on them is annoying and finicky. Having to populate rooms once you walk into them midway through the game is also annoying and anti-climatic. Between ability decks and attack modifier decks you might be playing a game with more than 15 different decks laying around, are you kidding me?

The ability deck mechanic in this game is completely flawed and just creates a false sense of strategy and options when in the majority of cases, you are always shoved into a corner with one, maybe two actually correct plays to make. I can come up with multiple better ideas in how to force a rotation among abilities better than simply having you lose the card for the scenario simply because it was a good ability. What happened to the dude in a thematic sense? did he forget how to cast a spell? It's a ridiculous mechanic. Perhaps an ability point system could have been used, with better cards costing more AP and not as powerful cards costing less AP. The same exact end result would have been achieved without the demented discard and lost piles. The concept of mana or energy could have also been utilized instead, with powerful cards costing more mana and mana could have been recovered through resting. Again, same end result without cumbersome and anti-climatic decks management.

The setup, storing and overhead management of this game is also ridiculous (to note that I even bought the Broken Token insert!). All the different decks that need to be managed and stored, with certain attack modifiers being added only in certain scenarios which then need to be removed. Ability decks that get changed and updated. Everything is so cumbersome and it simply does not add enough to the game to make it remotely worth it.

Ultimately, I really struggle to find a single thing about this game that is fun or well designed. Despite my best efforts I can't find a single thing about this game I like and enjoy. Needless to say I am extremely disappointed by this game but I can also understand why to so many, this seems like a fantastic game. It's the perfect game for casual gamers who like to be guided into a decision rather than having multiple real options. It's easy, it's comforting and offers that sense of reward and gratification common to role playing games which again, if that's what you crave, try playing some PC RPG games, they offer that same great feeling, times 10. And if you are looking for a great co-op boardgame, then try something like Pandemic Legacy.

As of why the game has such a high rating? I could write a whole other essay on that alone! If you care to discuss, feel free to reach out to me.

Cannot describe how much fun this game is, hand management, between game deck customization and leveling yourselves and the town. The only thing that I can say negatively is setup time, but that can be streamlined with organization and for a game that allows for random dungeons, there is always going to be setup time.

RATING: 10
Incredible design. A true 10 star game and well deserving the #1.

First I don't care much about the legacy elements or the story parts, but it's a great way of slowly unlocking content. It means new players have a limited amount of characters that are easier to learn while more complex ones become available later. Also the starting level of new characters increases over time, meaning even the first character you played will have new options later on that increase or change the experience when playing the character again.
Where this design choice really shows is the personal mission each character has. If your character fulfills his secret mission he retires, unlocking new content. This gives you a very specific goal you are trying to fulfill beyond completing the scenario in front of you, and adds so much to the feeling of the game.

What makes Gloomhaven so great is how ridiculously well designed it is. The difficulty is well balanced so that each map is finished just about in time before you run out of actions - and balance is great for different player counts as well. The characters are fun to play with combos and cool abilities. They play very different to each other, much more than in other similar games.
The card based based combat is awesome. First you don't draw - your cards and available actions are fully controlled by you. All your options are available as the game starts and slowly you lose cards until you are exhausted - its very clever as it adds an aspect of resource management. Your character can burn very bright for few big moves, but you have to rein her/him in to last till the end of the scenario.
Next you don't play a card - you play two cards. Each card has 2 possible actions, top and bottom. For one card you have to do the top action, for the other card the bottom action, in any order. Meaning with only 5 cards left you still have more than 20 possible combinations not to mention that cards can be used as a default attack/move action ignoring their text. On top of that you know which of the cards you might get back after this or further turns and which not, meaning you want to plan ahead for future combos. It's a brilliant system that deserves way more credit than it gets.

In contrast to this there is a damage modifier deck adding up to +/-2 to your attack (we're playing variant without miss/crit). It's a good distribution with +0 being very common, +1 or -1 less common and finally +/-2 being rare. While I dislike this (bad luck on most luck based mechanics), you mitigate this offer time - permanently. First you don't roll die, you draw from a deck enforcing a certain level of distribution, second as characters level up they change the distribution of the deck removing negative cards adding positive ones. With new characters starting at higher levels you very quickly skew the deck in your favour. To give you an idea - after 3 scenarios I was level 3 with 1 perk, removing 2x -1 cards and adding 4x +1 cards to the deck. I didn't actually count the cards, but I think you start with 20. You can even add powerful bless cards to it for 1 mission by spending some gold.

This level of randomness in a coop game is fun and I wouldn't change it (coming from someone who wouldn't play the game if it had dice rolling for to hit rolls). And if you like games of chance (first go to a casino and don't ruin boardgames, but second..) you can make the deck more "chancy" by removing most +0s and adding few stronger cards to it.

Note that I find the rulebook terrible to use. The rules individually are easy to read and comprehend, but there is many of them and the structure of the rulebook is painful, so finding specific information can grind games to a halt.

TLDR summary: Absolute must-play and #1 is very deserved for its brilliant design and perfect execution.

I don't know why I thought I would like this game.  I mean, I like the idea of Gloomhavun, a Euro style dungeon crawl.  I like how the cards work, and each character plays differently.  However, getting into this game was horribly frustrating, same kind of finicky rules as Imperial Assault or Kingdom Death: Monster.

I spent hours organizing this game, hours watching videos and reading the instructions, and then when I go to finally play the game we have questions for nearly everything we encounter. 

I have too many other games to give this one any more of my precious time.  Send me a PM if you are interested in my copy.

I do not log plays with my main group. We should be over 10 scenarios.

The game is amazing. Most of scenarios had "we lost for sure!" moment being transferred into "wow! We did it!!!". Very satisfying experience. Not sure how Isaac did it, but I never saw such refined balance in other games.

Legacy elements could be deeper, but what we have already is good.

Branching story is definitely plus, even though I don't expect much - this is not PC after all.

Card game mechanic is simple but exciting. Many people tend to complain about restriction of information flow between players. I love it. Without secrecy on "initiative", game would transfer into chess. In most cases your perfect plan would be modified by teammate in your way, unexpectedly early\late monster initiative or their non-standard action.
Cards lost mechanic is good way how to apply timer. We know much worse ways (like Encounters in DnD board games). This mechanic not only rush you to fulfill the goal, but force you to prioritize your powerful but "lost" and weaker but "discarded" cards.

Last but definitely not least. Upgrades. Hands down - awesome. You can control your luck to certain extend by modifying Attack Deck. It not only adds some damage to your attacks, but adds additional helpful perks. You can not only damage enemy, but add "poison", "wound" e.t.c. to it. Or maybe push/pull them.

After completing certain mission, you could upgrade cards themselves. This is costly, but interesting, as provides some interesting choices.

Next level gives you better cards, that you can add to your hand. Mind you, that you can choose which of them to take to mission, based on possible enemies. More AOE? Or concentrate on single target damage? Or maybe more buff/healing for party?

So why I keep 10 as my rating?

Game is huge for it's price point. 90 scenarios + random ones, many enemies, legacy elements and dissent story, funny way of upgrading/manipulating your hero and his abilities,.........

As it currently stands, this game is a 9.5 for me.  I will update this as I play more, but so far it's absolutely amazing.  I have one campaign going with a friend, and am going to start a separate campaign solo.

For those who may be doing the same as me, I urge you to get the interactive map from the files section here, as it will allow you to preserve the board and keep achievements separate from your main campaign.

Will more than likely update in the near future to record my thoughts on the gameplay solo, but as a co-op, it is stellar if you have people you really enjoy playing with.

Update: After a week or so of solo play, I'm still in love with this game.  I bought various things to make the organization of the game a lot better, so setup is a breeze now.  Even with the amount of time put in, I'm currently only through 3 scenarios with my solo party, so this is a VERY meaty game, to say the least.  I will try and update this review again once I've made any sort of considerable progress in the game, but as it stands now, it's absolutely fantastic in my opinion.

[url=http://www.techuser.net/klondikeprob.html]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url] 

The Legacy mechanism is a sustainability nightmare that devalues a board game worse than driving a new motor vehicle off the dealership lot, and like a car salesmen the publishers are laughing their way to the bank. A short term narrative gain is not worth the loss of replay ablity. I'd rather play a campaign.

RATING: 9.5
Time to update: I started rating this game as 8 after the first 2 scenarios. Upgraded it to 9 after 10 or so scenarios. Now after 22 scenariois I just have to bump it up to 9.5 (I do not have rated any game a 10, ever. I'd say the closests ones getting a ten from me so far would have been Imperial Assault and Bloodbowl)

Our gaming group likes the legacy aspect of the game (I never sell my old games so I don't have to worry about resale value). You play through missions and are slowly rewarded with more of the story opening up, making decisions etc. At first leveling up and getting more equipment/stuff/info/scenarios seemed slow, but after 22 or so missions the speed seems just fine.

Pros: 
+I really like the inbuilt timer system with loosing cards, it works really well.
+Lot's of content (There is some repetition to the missions, but that was supposed to be expected)
+Characters play really differently (Only seen mostly the starting characters so far)
+Legacy campaign (I don't mind putting stickers on the game board or marking stuff with a pen on the components, I do like the storytelling part of the game and cant wait to read out more stuff, after grinding through yet another mission)
+Monsters have variety in them

Cons:
- Setup and tear down time, it's really one of those games that you can't just call your friends "Let's play a quick scenario or 2 after work". But with this amount of stuff in the game, that cannot be helped. I do not store the game components in the box they came in, so that speeds up the setup quite a bit though.

The hype is real. This game does everything it promises offering you an immersive, streamlined and highly enjoyable role playing experience that is easy to pick up and countless hours of fun. Our group has now completed 6 quests and are regularly meeting 2x's a month with anxious excitement to get back to the table. There's no doubt that if we could do more, we would, and as it stands now no other game will be getting our attention in 2018 as we continue on our journey together.

Post KS1 Cephalofair Preorder (I ordered it on a whim. Luckiest whim ever!)

Fantastic, FANTASTIC game that is so much more than the sum of its parts. It combines dungeon crawling with euro-gameplay with adventure paths in a fantastic way. The game hasn't left my table since I got it, and literally EVERY bit of gameplay I've done since that time has been this game.

Absolutely phenomenal.

2017-12-03: Played first room of first mission at friend's house after spending over 2 hours opening the box, punching the pieces, and setting up.  So many pieces!  Game seems quite good, but I'm not going to rate it on only a few minutes of play.
2017-12-19: Played first mission again with proper rules this time and we died easily.  I had fun, but the owner said that he's likely to sell the game due to the very long setup/teardown time.
2017-12-20: I bought it from that friend.  Hopefully I can still get him to play it now and then after I update the storage solution for quick setup.

Totally blown away! This is the game that got me into the board gaming world, so needless to say I'm pretty new to the joys of tabletop gaming.

 However, this game has opennd my eyes to what board games have to offer. Had always only played video games but on a total whim blind buy, bought Pandemic:Reign of Cthulhu at Barnes and Noble not having a clue what I was buying. 

Got home, played a few rounds with my wife, had a blast, researched other games and found Gloomhaven.... And in a blink of an eye, I was reborn and my nerd conversation was complete!!

Euro Legacy DnD in a really big box.

The story elements are interesting as you get a steady drip feed of happenings in/around gloomhaven as you take on scenarios and slowly uncover what's going on. The personal quests you get for each character add a bit of theme and an overarching goal to work towards and is an interesting way of adding a bit of player "conflict" when it comes to where to go.

The combat system is more like a puzzle than a hack and slash. You want to be efficient with your actions so you don't get exhausted and leave your friends while your character takes a nap. Battle objectives are a nice way to make you change your strategy as they are the way you unlock perks for your character and can sometimes lead you to do odd or selfish things just to accomplish them.

I really like the way the rulebook explains how you should communicate in combat, rather than giving specific values like saying "I'm going on initiative 10 and doing a base damage of 5" you should say "I'm gonna go really fast and stab that guy dead" which is a bit more fun to me at least.

Unlocking stuff as you go along is really cool and the game supports people dropping in and out between scenarios and people can even play multiple characters depending on the scenario if they wish. If people don't care for the story they can just drop into scenarios or drop out when they feel like which gives it some flexibility and even when you're done with the game it's still playable with others for their first time by just adding a character to the party (or just a one off scenario with no record if you want to do it that way).

This is my wife and I's favorite game to play together. The level of complexity is not as high as the amount of fiddly bits that come in the box, but it is a deep dungeon crawler with short term hand management and long term deck-building and a persistent world. It's as close as we've come to playing an RPG while still playing a boardgame.

Gloomhaven seems like a great game, but I can’t play any Legacy game. I can’t stand the destruction of components in any way. A game should be taken care of, not the other way around.

If there was a way to experience the game without damaging it,  I would buy it for sure, but as it stands, I think you have to use stickers in many places so I won’t be buying it or playing it.

For me, there has to be a way to reset the game completely after you finish with it (like TIME Stories) or I cannot buy it.

I just saw that there is a way to not damage the game :D, due to this I just baked the game on KS. I need to try any Top Ten game and Gloomhaven is currently number 6 on BGG´s ratings.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2018)

Gloomhaven is now the best game in the world if you follow BGG ranks as I do, due to this, and even though I rationally know that I shouldn’t let myself be swayed by the hype, I had huge expectations from the game, and they were utterly crushed last week. I made a lot of mistakes regarding Gloomhaven. My past self was into dungeon delving but my present self no longer enjoy them as much so there was no reason for me to buy Gloomhaven, but I pledged for it on Kickstarter nonetheless.

I abhor the idea of Legacy games, but I knew from the beginning that Gloomhaven can be played with removable stickers which I also bought, so the Legacy issue was solved.

Last week I read the rules, they aren’t very hard to understand but the rulebook makes them a lot harder to learn. It begins by explaining the cards and how to set up the scenarios but only on page 16 it begins to really explain how to play the game. That´s illogical and it makes them a lot harder to learn because it throws you all the terms/rules without any context of how to use them. It should explain first the turn structure and then continue with the rest. Once you understand them, they aren’t hard to explain. You can do it under 30 minutes because there are many MANY rules, but they make sense so it is easy to teach. Playtime is very variable because it depends on the scenario, still, I feel gameplay goes very slow, downtime is high (a cardinal sin for me).

Best 3 players.

I really like the theme and the name is awesome.

Gloomhaven´s components are, in general, very good. The box comes filled to the brim with content and it is a very big box (the biggest in my collection). It has so much cardboard, that closing the lid after punching it is very hard. For the price you pay, the game deliver a lot of content. The player´s miniatures are gorgeous. The game come with standees for the monsters and they are too tight, that’s very bad because you have to constantly put them on and take them off, damaging the monster tiles in the process.

The art of the game is ok. The terrain tiles are a little too generic, but they are ok. I expected the art to be a bit better but I don't mind. 

The rulebook doesn’t have a comprehensive list of components which I found appalling. Instead of saying how many monsters of each type, it lumps them together and says “240 monster standees” so counting them is a very time consuming chore and if you lose one, finding the missing one will be very time consuming.

Punching the game is a nightmare and it takes a lot of time to do so. Sleeving the cards is also a boring task as it has around 1500 cards.
 
Gameplay is very interesting at first, but then it becomes very repetitive. Each player and monster will act on a given turn in order of initiative. Monsters are directed by an artificial intelligence. Players will play 2 cards from their hand. Choosing which card to play isn’t obvious, but it isn’t also a hard decision. The amount of cards you have at hand is also your life (of sorts) and you can never recuperate it at 100%, so it works as a (very slow) timer. When you level up you get access to more powerful cards.

I really like the idea behind the game, but it doesn’t have anything that hasn’t been done before (to an extent). The campaign goal is to achieve the scenario´s succeed condition so you get experience and loot. I really like the idea of leveling up (I love Pathfinder) but here is too slow (because the game lack excitement for me). Also the idea of retiring a character doesn’t appeal to me as I want to take him to the maximum possible level, but I understand the concept in the game and when you retire, new characters become avalible (very neat). I thought the first scenario was going to be much faster than it was and it only has 3 tiles!

When you finish an scenario, other scenarios become avalible, this progression is very cool, but nothing new.

Much like Kingdom Death monster, after the scenario you can go home to regroup, level up, retire, and buy and sell new equipment and many other things. I do love that, even though Gloomhaven is a cooperative game, you gold and your stuff is yours . Players cannot share gold between themselves and that’s new for me in this format (although it doesn't make thematic sense it allows for egotistical play) . As in KDM, I like this phase much more than the game itself and that’s very telling for me. I think I shouldn't be playing Gloomhaven.

When I was playing Gloomhaven, a couple of times I thought I could be playing Myth instead (a superior game in my book). I feel the same way when I play both games, but I prefer Myth at this point in time. Myth also has a campaign mode, side quests, leveling up so they are very similar in my mind but Myth isn't a Legacy game. I know Gloomhaven develops a unique game situation with the (semi) permanent stickers to signal global changes and player level/experience, but I'm pretty sure this feeling could be simulated without permanently modifying the game. Gloomhaven lose some points for being a Legacy game, for me, the waste is too much.

Gloomhaven has a lot of replayability, it has many different scenarios.

Setup time and tear down time are very high.

If I were to continue with the campaign, Gloomhaven would become a lifestyle game. It has many scenarios and I wouldn’t be able to complete even half of them in a year nor I would want to do that as I prefer to play many other games.

The game has a high luck factor, but as it is a cooperative game I don’t mind it as much. Unlike most games in the genre, here you won’t roll any dice, instead you have cards to determine the outcome of a battle. At first I enjoyed this mechanism as you can influence the outcome (with advantage or leveling up, or getting perks) but as you battle a lot in each scenario, at the end I was bored by it, it is way too repetitive. I cannot believe I’m going to say this, but I think I miss the dice. 

Bottom line, As Gloomhaven is currently number 1 here at BGG, I was expecting something great but I was sorely disappointed. I found a game that feels exactly like other dungeon crawler games I have played before (Myth, KDM) and I didn’t found anything special about it. I understand this game is not for me. I’m a bit sad about the time I spent learning it, sleeving it, punching it and organizing it. I will play it again because I made a commitment with my game group, but at this point, I would prefer to sell it. This is the final nail in the “fantasy dungeon crawler” style of game for me. I still (somewhat) like Descent (one vs many) and I love MoM: Second Edition (perhaps due to the theme?, I need to think about this) but I won’t ever buy or pursue a play of this kind of game. It feels like too much work for too little reward, Gloomhaven is very repetitive and very slow. I recognize Gloomhaven can be a tremendous game for other people but it isn't for me. I was expecting too much from it, I will learn my lesson this time. I prefer Kingdom Death Monster over it and I don't really like KDM.

In retrospect it's not surprising that someone came up with, essentially, Descent Legacy.  It is surprising how well it was done though, or more to the point that Gloomhaven wasn't beaten to market by a less interesting legacy dungeon crawler.  I've only played one scenario so have to reserve some judgment but from all appearances this game deserves every bit of the hype it's gotten.

Fun tactical battle system in the spirit of Mage Knight. Component quality is very good and you get so much "stuff" (which is probably why it rates so highly). 

Not a major fan of the setup (so much to sift through and organise) and, outside of the actual combat mechanic, there's not much else to it. Still, it's a fun game and I'm glad it's in my collection (now I just need to find some time to complete it).

I like Gloomhaven's combat because it's not easy to play your actions optimally.  It's an interesting puzzle from turn to turn, and also to coordinate with your team how to take on the enemy.  This part reminds me of Mage Knight somewhat, as opposed to Descent and the ilk where there's not a lot of actual tactics involved.
The RPG stuff is fine, too.

I feel like I'm rushing a review for this after a single play, and I will come back and adjust it if necessary, but I'm very impressed.

While I'm scoring at at 10, I'm doing that realizing fully that it's not a perfect game. A few of the mechanics feel arbitrary (after we kill all the bad guys, we can't loot the bodies?), and it plays a bit slower than it could.

It earns the 10, though, for the sheer quality of the experience. I started as Cragheart, and I can't wait to play a bunch more sessions with this character to learn it and develop it further, but I also can't wait to bust into those other boxes. The fights with the enemies are really tense, because you're never really sure what they will do--and even in the first scenario, a few enemies did things we weren't expecting at all.

The choices so far feel impressive, and it's amazing how quickly it starts feeling like your own special copy of the game. It seems to play really well with two players, and while I'd be willing to go to 3, I worry that 4 would require a level of tactical control that I know I don't have.

I don't really have much to say that hasn't been said a bunch of times already, but Gloomhaven is a hell of a game, and manages to feel like an OSR dungeon crawl while replicating (pretty much) none of its core mechanics, which is awesome.

Well worth the wait (and the weight). It is difficult to know where to start. I suffer a bit from hype disappointment but not with Gloomhaven. I was extremely excited at having backed the kickstarter and when it finally arrived, I was blown away by the game. As a D&D dungeon master, it is nice to have a fantastic game that GMs itself. The combat mechanism makes every battle an excellent puzzle/logistical problem to solve and the story and legacy aspects of the game engage me thoroughly. I am pleased that I chose the minis on my pledge and the overall production level is excellent. The game is not without it's issues but, thanks to The Geek, and the kind people contributing, I have found solutions. Overall, just stunning.

Kickstarted this.
Let me start off by saying that I kickstarted the second edition (with an estimated delivery of September). 
I understand it's an "estimate". But you would think that the second time around they would come "somewhat" close their the estimated date? It looks like it's not going to arrive until November (if all "goes well"). 
So, this rating isn't even from my, yet to arrive, kick-started copy. 
It's from playing with a different copy with some friends.

Moving on. 
I've edited and erased most of my review because BGUser: Poptech posted a extensive review that hits on all the issues I have with game. And is much more eloquent then I am. 
Suffice to say, I own 500+ board games and this game is the so over-hyped, and so underwhelming, it's baffling. 
This is the kind of game that greatly reinforces the term ameritrash. 
So much stuff in the box but so little in the way of cohesive, intelligent game-play.

RATING: 10
Ok, calling this one early... its a great game.

The game play is Mage Knight 'lite' with a massive persistent world, and many decisions to make.

The game is hard, but not in an arbitrary way - each of the 3 scenarios I've played has taken a different strategy to be successful on the 2nd play, as opposed to simply suffering poor luck. 

Each of the different enemies and combination of enemies requires a very different strategy, and the decisions are non-obvious in most instances.

Overall, I've played this game for 12 hours already and i'm only 3% complete so at that rate it'll take me about 400 hours to complete the game. Will I make it? Ask me in a few years :)  

Update Feb 17: Took it to a games weekend away with friends. We started with Gloomhaven at 11am and no one wanted to stop all weekend, we played 9 scenarios and no other games all weekend.

There are also clear signs of us getting better at the game - the slower progression really allows you to become an expert in your character and our win rate has climbed appropriately. The scenarios have all been sufficiently different and at LVL 5 my character is very close to fulfilling their personal goal.

March Update - just keeps getting better - there is no longer any 'brain burn' in the turns and the whole party operates smoothly with lots of table talk to decide how best to approach each situation. Unlocking new characters is fun, but also provides a pleasant spike in difficulty as you often are left dealing with non-traditional party make up which causes some fun tensions and often requires some creativity in which cards to bring for a specific scenario.

May update. 31 plays in, I'm completely hooked. Going to be playing this one until it's finished. Then I'll probably start again with a friends copy. 

June 2017 - 36 plays in
This is a Modern Classic, stone cold 10/10, all four people in my regular play group have ordered a copy, despite playing mine for all this time. Its dominated my table for 5 months, and its still all we want to play. Were going t be in this for the long haul until we finish the main story line at least, and then probably play through again making different choices as we go, playing other characters.

If you think that you'll like this type of game at all, and you will have the opportunity to play it then certainly pick this up, its a milestone in modern gaming.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for Solo only, unless you're really into that as much of the enjoyment I get from the game is the interacting abilities with 3 or 4 characters in play, and that would be a lot of mental overhead to separate out on your own.

July:
Well my review comment made it onto the latest kickstarter video so I guess it was Ok :)

November 17:
49 plays in, completed the main narrative and after approx 150 hours my group has decided to shelve the game for now in order to catch up with all the other games released in 2017. We still have approximately 45 scenarios still to play and 2 characters not yet opened, so will revisit our world from time to time and it remains one of the best games I've ever played, and cant imagine turning down an opportunity to play.

If I designed a dungeon crawler it would share a lot with Gloomhaven. It only needs to improve the narrative layer and the AI (different focus algorithms) to be perfect.

UPDATE: after 20 plays, I think some other mechanics could be improved upon too. Like the element infusions or the advantage/disadvantage system.

UPDATE: after 40 plays, the elemental infusions or the advantage/disadvantage system no longer bother me. The story, though, is failing to engage me, even though the setting is fine. Sometimes it's hard to make sense of the order of events.  The achievement system is underused, it should impact the narration more.

Also, some scenarios that try different winning conditions fail at balance. They are too easy choosing the right strategy, like ignoring the slower enemies and leave them behind for good.

What an epic, expansive game. I bought this on a whim, hoping I could convince my wife to play it with me. Needless to say, it didn't take much convincing. After one scenario, we are hooked. The meta-game is great, really pulls you into the story, and the scenarios themselves are simply fantastic. The cardplay mechanisms work so well, and the enemy AI is a masterwork of elegant design. Looking forward to seeing more of what this world has to offer.

I think my slipped disc problem has returned lifting the box!
Arrived Jan 2017 KS with minis
Words fail me about how much stuff there is included in one of the biggest (and chuffing heaviest) game boxes I have seen in recent years - and I backed Conan. This is very good value for sheer components alone - I hope the gameplay is as good as anticipated.

Excellent game - I've started the solo campaign with a view to having guest players take over characters as I go along if they are interested in playing it. Very tough start but getting the hang of it now. A very good contender for my own game of the year 2017 at the moment.

I've never rated anything 'Game of the Decade'. This is currently my 'Game of the Decade' - if it was easy, I would not give it this accolade but the theme and strategy requirements are simply brilliant.

This game is so difficult yet so fascinating and strategically challenging I cannot praise it enough. I like the fact that just when I think I have sorted out a scenario I lose yet again, but then i am able to lower the difficulty level to make it 'just' possible to complete. Fantastic.

It's a good game, but it isn't a clean game. Lots of moving pieces that demands you to maintain the state of the game. There are some apps to help with that.

The game has lots of "damage sponge" enemies, and it gets very grindy in those times, and that's when the game is at its worse. But that does lend to more exciting endings of a scenario. Fun choices are made. Fun/frustrating coordination that can ruin your plans.

The game isn't perfect. It's clunky. But when it fires off well, it's a great experience.

My only reliable gaming group is just myself and the wife.  We had been wanting to delve into pen & paper RPGs such as D&D, but a single DM and player is quite challenging to make work, especially for an inexperienced first time DM.  Enter Gloomhaven.  We've finally found the board game dungeon crawler of our dreams to scratch that D&D itch we've never been able to scratch.

Does this game live up to the hype ?  Let me first say that the game is somewhat long to setup and tear down. But it is an amazing game.  I find that the difficulty level of this game to be on the high side, and failing a scenario just doesn't add to the fun factor for me.  I feel like I just wasted a few hours and I have to replay the scenario again.  I want this game to be fun to play over it to be more challenging, so I played this game with a house rule, all perks unlocked from the start.  Happy hunting.  My rating says that it does live up to the hype.  One of my top 10 games of all time.

The world of Gloomhaven provides both a puzzle and programming adventure draped in an epic, freewheeling story. The design is impressive and the depth enormous, but game play can seriously suffer (and lag) without a fully-engaged experienced player at the table. But if you have that experience at the table, this BGG darling can be quite satisfying and enjoyable.

If you put this side-by-side with Fantasy Flight's Descent, it'd be hard to tell them apart.   There's oddly shaped chipboard dungeon halls.  There's maps telling you where to lay all the monsters and treasures.

The main difference is in the combat.  Every character has a set of unique cards... that mostly come down to D&D style move+attack actions.  But everybody has to stick to what their cards do, so in a very simple way, it's got programming mechanics.  Your characters also advance through 9 levels of cards, loot, and "checkmarks" that improve your "luck."  

In addition, instead of a GM, monsters move & attack.  However, each monster has a special deck, which sometimes has the monster do something else, like only move, or "activate special ability A."  Like a GM, though, all the players sit by idly while whoever the player who controls the monsters does it.    

I was thoroughly unimpressed by the storytelling, the road cards, and the city cards.  I'm sure Gloomhaven tried to replicated Kingdom Death in several ways, but it felt like disjointed tidbits.  Unlike KD:M's events that have the players make decisions and have random results, Gloomhaven's version has no replay-ability.  If you've seen a card before, you know which answer to give so you can get rewards and avoid penalties.  

The book is bound in an open-comb binder, which causes pages to fall out if you rotate them to the back.   The text is also TINY.  Like 5 pt font for all cards.  The images were also TINY on the standees.  

In short, if you like dungeon crawlers, you'll probably like this one too.  But it is still a dungeon crawler at heart, just a better version of one.

I love the complexity and all of the layers of detail. If you want something light weight, literally and figuratively, I don't recommend this game. If you're looking for something that is complex, with a massive amount of content broken into bite sized chunks, this might be a game for you.

I'll start with a small critique.  I will admit that it doesn't have a deeply immersive world that Kingdom Death Monster has, the world it creates is wholly original, but hasn't grabbed me in the same way.  The town and road events haven't been as interesting as I hoped but this is my only (minor) quibble with the game.  

Now onto the good... Gloomhaven has BY FAR the BEST, most interesting, most unique, combat system in any game I have ever seen.  And combat is 95% of the game.

I love this game, possibly more than anything else I have ever played.

The characters are all very different, the customization is brilliant, the choices and decisions this game presents to players keep me engaged throughout.  Teamwork and coordination are really spectacular and I've only seen about half of the character classes.

I have a regular weekly group playing this and we sneak in extra mid-week sessions at every opportunity.

I deeply regret not purchasing this when I had the chance.

Update: This game just keeps getting better and better for me.  The amount of content in this box is absolutely astounding.  Thankfully I got a copy with the second printing and I now also play a solo campaign for myself in addition to the weekly campaign we have been playing for about a year.

This game and Kingdom Death Monster have redefined what a 10 is for me.

Forget playing D&D or any other role-playing/dungeon crawling game for two years as you tackle over 95 scenarios which each take about four hours to complete. This is what every legacy game should strive to be.

Después de 4 partidas, sigo sin entender la emoción mundial con el juego. ¿Cuánto tiempo hay que jugarlo para empezar a ver la recompensa? Difícil saberlo.  El arte debería ayudarme un poco a disfrutar la historia, pero no lo hace: Las losetas de piso son genéricas y aburridas, y las cartas no me transmiten nada. Ahora, dado que el combate es algo que se hace todo el tiempo, este debería ser un poco más táctico/emocionante. Pero ni lo uno ni lo otro. Y sobre todo, cada partida debería ser épica, pero no lo es. Debido a la alta expectativa, es una gran decepción.

I was pretty skeptical of the hype for this one, but it definitely surpassed my expectations. My most played game of 2017, and I’m not even close to burning out on this game. Never was taken by any other dungeon crawl or tactical combat game I had played before. But the clever card play, building up your character and modifier deck, and just how differently every character plays is amazing. The hand management aspect is the core part of the game where your hand of cards is actually the game timer. The prospect that you can exhaust yourself pushes you to be very aggressive and also makes the choices tough because if you use a very powerful card it is removed from the game, but losing cards too early can mean you might exhaust before finishing the scenario. Amazing game and a well deserved #1 on BGG. Definitely prefer this at the full four players though, allows for nice synergy between strengths of different classes.

An efficiency exercise masquerading as a dungeon crawl.  The card discard timer is all about doing the most boringly efficient thing for the first 70% of a scenario so that you don’t run out of cards.  One distinctly unfun moment was when I had to cross a room to press a button to finish a scenario, and burning cards for movement while confusing the rudimentary AI targeting made for a lame puzzle.

My kids refuse to play ever again after 4 sessions.

The only downside to this game is the set up, and sometimes slightly unclear instructions.

That being said, this game is Isaac's love letter to board games. It's intricate card combat system, to the slow methodical upgrading of your decks, the overarching reactions the world has to your party's actions - this game isn't just something you break out once or twice a week for game nights to pass the time, it's a living breathing world where multiple groups could be interacting with eachother on a global level by opening up new locations and adventures. Quite literally it could almost be a different world if another group has a different mindset.

At first that can be offsetting, but it speaks to the depth of the game that it doesn't feel gimmicky. If anything, it adds to the sense of wonder in the world. Forget DND or an average dungeon crawler, this feels more like an elder scrolls story brought to life in a boardgame.

Combat is finely tuned and demanding, characters are varied and definitely unique in their capabilities. The campaign can take up to 400 hours, there's casual play or infinite dungeon generator if you just want to goof off and treat it as a normal board game. And that's important, because the first thing you'll learn is that this isn't a normal board game. This is a story that you're meant to be a part of, but at the same time you can just enjoy having some time goofing off and having fun. The mechanics are a little unwieldy at first but are easy to grasp once you jump in, and the first time you set up a personal combo with the crag by creating an obstacle only to smash it immediately to pummel your enemies with chunks of broken rock is an experience unequaled in board games.

My wife and I have played it every day since we got our copy, and have worked out tracker sheets so we can run clean campaigns for several of our friends so they can experience everything gloomhaven has to offer as well. If you have the chance, get this game. It's amazing, and Isaac Childres is a mad genius.

wahnsinnig viel Zeug in der Box, es wirkt alles sehr kreativ und interessant! Karten dürften etwas stärker sein und auch der Einband des Questbuches könnte kein normales 60g Blatt sein.

-1 für die Qualität der Figuren, die Details sind echt mies zu bemalen. OK für das Spiel an sich nicht wichtig aber aus Miniaturensicht 4/10
-1 für Ordnungssystem. Da ne Übersicht zu behalten ist Horror. Die Tiles also Bodenpläne bringt man irgendwie garnichtmehr vernünftig in die Box
-1 wiederverwendbare Aufkleber (dann aus Silikon) gibt es nur über einen Drittanbieter auch wenn der Preis OK wäre (15 EUR inkl. Versand) aber daran hätte der Entwickler auch denken oder zumindest gegen Aufpreis anbieten können. Das würde den Wert der Box erhalten und man könnte das Spiel zurücksetzen ohne alles neu Kaufen zu müssen.

Fun co-operative dungeon crawler type game.  Surprisingly easy and simple to play given all the stuff and giant rulebook (don't read it, instead watch an online video first).  Fiddly though probably not any more so than other similar games.  The character selections are weak and one in particular isn't very interesting - don't get stuck with that one.  If it wasn't for the group I play with, I wouldn't care to play this ever again as this isn't my type of game and I'm sure there has to be something better overall out there.  The production value is very bland; the artwork is okay but sparse and there isn't any visual draw to the game.

Given all the hype, the size of the package, and the price, I'd say this is definitely over-rated.  From the perspective of where the hobby stands, it's really sad that this type of overall game package/experience is making it into the BGG top 25.

Gloomhaven isn't simply a great game — it is among the best media experiences I've ever had. It is on par with my favourite movies, books and video games, something I will remember fondly for years to come. Sharing this game with my family is amazing, a gift I am grateful for. The system is fantastic, providing variety and depth out of the box with potential for endless content expansions. And the challenge easily scales from light family game to hardcore brain burner. There is (literally) a ton of enjoyment to be had in Gloomhaven!

The closest any boardgame has come to replicating an RPG. There is a trade-off though...setting up can take a while and the game can be so grindy it takes away from the fun. However, it is a unique experience that everyone who is a fan of Dungeon Crawlers has to play once or twice. Rulebook is a mess...no index and the need to watch youtube vids to know how to play needs to be fixed with the Third Edition.

RATING: 8.5
Impressive achievement in board game design both in mechanics and sheer volume of content.  This game has  effectively merged RPGs with board games and has raised the bar for RPG-style board games.

PROs:  (1) scenarios are captivating tactical puzzles, (2) combat mechanics are clean, streamlined, thematic and engrossing, (3) character upgrades and progressions hook you, (4) the writing is well done, (5) great value for the money...basically you get a base game plus the equivalent of 10 expansions in the box, (6) stokes the nostalgia for pen and paper RPGs, (7) great balance (well playtested) plus variable difficulty allows you to tweak the challenge level for your group.

CONs:  (1) overwhelming amount of cards and bits...it is an extreme organizational challenge and the insert provided is not up to the task...set-up and especially break down are a bear. expect to pay money for organizational upgrades, (2) 20 pound box difficult to transport, (3) the story overlaid atop the scenarios is somewhat thin so far and not overly interesting. i'm not curious about what comes next as it all feels somewhat generic, (4) fiddly beyond fiddliness with too much shuffling...easy to overlook housekeeping tasks...there is too much housekeeping, (5) the card exhaustion system can be frustrating and dictates that all scenarios be of equal length, (6) saminess:  kill all monsters in a pregenerated configuration of rooms (2 to 6), wash, rinse, repeat--very repetitive.  interest is falling with repeated plays, (7) one player has to look at the scenario set-up, so they basically see where all the monsters/treasure are from the start (no surprise), (8) traps are visible to all (very untraplike), (9) loot/treasure system clunky and it is frustrating to have to leave most loot/treasure behind because of timing mechanism.

Rating has fallen from 9.5 to 9.0 to 8.5 after my sixth session with this beast (2 player mostly). I'm catching a whiff of tedium/grinding. On the upside, the tactical combat is still interesting and the strength of the game. 

Had been my favorite board game for about 2 months, but the initial fanboy glow has faded.  Prediction:  this will not be the best RPG-style board game on the market in 3 years.  It makes a great first impression and has broken new ground but it is not the ultimate RPG-style board game.

Ok, so this is a long campaign-driven game so after 3 scenarios it's hard to be completely objective.

But this is everything I could want from dungeon crawl.

It's tactically puzzly without being a grind. The core action card mechanic is a deliciously difficult puzzle and asymmetric as shit (people still wrapping their head around "class builds"). The campaign is simple and tidy with A STICKERED MAP (so good!). The pacing is quick enough that you're not trapped in a session for 4 hours (good bye, Descent 1.0).

The value for money is ludicrous. Isaac could have made a series of expansions and hooked people on his crack for years. He didn't. He built a passion project and shared it all for a generous amount.

If you like dungeon crawls, you owe it to yourself to try this game (although it has euro sensibilities, Ameritrashy ones). I just hope we have enough time to complete the main plot.

A true accomplishment in board games.

Aug '17 update: 35 plays in, halfway through campaign. Game is starting to wear on me, the narrative isn't strong or streamlined enough to drive you to play more. The main driver to keep going is unlocking new classes. However, you have no control over that as objectives are random so you can get "trapped" playing classes you don't want. May suffer the Seafall fate of "abandoned halfway through and unpacked out of curiosity". Possibly made too large, and we should have staggered the fun into xpacs.

RATING: N/A
I like dungeon crawlers, and the fact that GH is diceless. However a box of 10kg taking up - unopened - more space than my desk, is something that will hold me back. And I don't have a couple extra years to crawl through all those samey dungons.

RATING: 7
My initial ratings was between a 6 and a 7, but it grew on me with more plays so increased it to an 8. The teamwork aspect is what wins me over as well as the need to upgrade your character which keeps you coming back for more. Update: No its probably between an 6 and 7. Game is a good design, no doubt about it, but I have very little desire to play it again.

RATING: 4
Bad:
* Boring combat
* Very fiddly with the damage markers going on the bad guy stats card and having to check the attack/defence/move/shield/stats/etc every time there is combat
* The world is fairly bland
* The artwork is not great and doesn't help pull things together
* Too many boring 'move and kill' scenarios. Really needs some better level design.

Good:
* The character decks and different play styles work
* Perks and upgrades are good

Overall:
* Very poor scenario design lets down the decent story and character development elements. 
* Constant trudge is dull - first half of each mission is slow and second half goes the same way just throwing everything at the last couple of enemies. 
* I do not get the hype - it's 'ok' but what are people seeing in this that i miss? I am continuing for now purely for the social aspect but this is not a very good game.

History. Games:
* 1-16: Tinker (then retired).
* 17 - ...: Sunkeeper

House Rules:
Rules as written, except: 
* When 'Advantaged' the 'Miss' card counts as zero
* When 'Disadvantaged' the 'x2' card counts as zero

Playing it with my wife, and we both love it. We have been playing 8 scenarios so far. The story is great, the fighting system is great. Actually everything in this game shines. Such a gem.

And we both want to play more and more to unlock new items and new stuff and unfold the story. Fantastic.

According to the 10 star rating, this means "will always enjoy playing". While there will come a day where I will probably be done with Gloomhaven, the amount of content in the game is absurd, replayability is endless, and I've enjoyed every single mission I've played, even repeat times. This deserves that 10.

So second printing is allready here on kickstarter.

A lot of my geekbuddies rate this a 10.

However some of the best comments made are those by people who give a list of pros and cons.

One of the cons is that a single fight took 90 minutes. 
The biggest pro is the content you are getting for 100 dollars and it even is better this turn around.

Having done some soulsearching I might be sorry not to go it for this time around but I feel I need a simpler game of this kind to get started and even than it is something that would rarely hit the table compared with my other games.

RATING: 10
This game... No, this Experience. Because it is not just a game. It's a ride, a terrific wonderful crazy ride.
When I felt this, I've only read the rule book and opened the box.
The imagination, ingenuity, simple innovation, and outstanding heart put into this game, is just incomprehensible.

The box is about 20-25lbs. There is more content in this box than every board game I've ever ever seen.

The depth in which the game unfolds as you play, is incredible.
The choices you make leave a legacy for future players and future groups.
Each character has their own motivations, goals, ambitions.

Each scenario unfolds more of the world, uniquely altering the global agenda of your campaign.

Side quest scenarios open up. Random Dungeons can be populated. Tailoring your progression to your desire to move the story forward.
----

I'll end my review here by saying. This is probably the greatest game I have seen. 
My wife and I will strive to unlock the hidden secrets of Gloom Haven, and eagerly await the expanded world.

Please continue

This game took over my life for a couple weeks.  I played it constantly, left it out, and shotgunned the main quest.  I played about 50 games in about 2 weeks, and I loved every minute of it.  The game gets better with each play, and for that reason is not really at its best as a one-off, but if you want to give it the time it needs to grow on you, there is really nothing like it!

RATING: 10
After playing about ten scenarios of Gloomhaven so far, I can say that this is definitely one of my favorite board games of all time. I have always been a fan of dungeon crawlers and this game just does things right. You got noticible character progression with scaling difficulty levels, a lot of different playable characters, most of which need to be unlocked and a huge amount of monsters. Most dungeon crawlers out there have a very limited selection of monsters to fight or require you to buy a load of expansions to get more monsters, because they all come with expensive miniatures, so overall you have to invest a fortune. In Gloomhaven the monsters are cardstock, but that's completely fine with me. I get a lot of different enemies at a reasonable pricetag. What I also like about Gloomhaven is that there is so much stuff to unlock and explore. You get cohesive story arcs that unfold over the course of the game, while there are also some unrelated sidequests to do.
The combar system is very fun, as it does not rely as much on the luck of the draw as many of the dicechucking games do. You have to make meaningful decisions, while communicating with your party members and due to the scaling difficulty, in the end it will often be quite close.
Overall this game has just been awesome so far and I can't wait for an expansion, even though we're not even half part through it yet.

Gloomhaven has almost entirely consumed my gaming time. Its gameplay definitely favors its Eurogame roots, but it offers RPG growth/customization, story, and legacy consequences.

Pros - Brilliant combat design, unique characterization and advancement, great cooperative play.
Cons - Mediocre story, disappointing item design, repetitive scenarios. 

I started out loving Gloomhaven and usually find something to enjoy with each play session, but monsters almost always feel the same and some of the mechanics are very gamey. From time to time a scenario really brings new life back into the game, and opening up a new character is always thrilling.

Look for it, and grab it when you can!

Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for travelling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.

This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

When I ordered Gloomhaven, I thought it looked interesting.  When it came closer to delivery, I began to hear huge buzz about this game.  Although I had concerns about overhype, it turns out that they were actually right.  This is my top game in my entire collection.  I normally buy games that are top 100 but this one blew most of them out of the water.  The group who played this put in 8hrs of gameplay this week.  They have already asked to have two game nights each week so we can keep playing this game.  Well done, Isaac Childres ... you have made a masterpiece hybrid of dungeon crawler, card driven euro, and the best legacy game ever.

RATING: 10
Believe the hype. This game is perfect. 

If you ever wanted your favorite RPG to be a board game, this is it...except better. The world, the scenarios/missions, the decision-making, the characters and abilities, the enemies, the maps, the leveling-up, a thousand other things, and last but not least, the BEST combat system I have ever had the joy of playing. 

The card based combat is better than any dice-rolling or any other card combat I have ever played. Before I played this game for myself, my friend tried to explain why it was so good, and it didn't sound that special to me. But then I started playing the game for myself and I instantly understood what he was talking about. Like him, I could try to explain to you how fun and balanced the cards are, how you use the top half of one card and the bottom half of another on each turn. I could explain how these cards are also like your health (in addition to your actual health), and how fun and challenging it is to use the right ones at the right time. I could also talk about how amazingly all the character's and enemies abilities come together. But even after all that, you'd probably be like me and not think that this game is anything special. So if that's the case, I would strongly encourage you to simply believe the 9.1 (current) rating and go play the best game I have ever played. The game that makes me seriously never want to play anything else...

I love dungeon and fantasy themed games but this doesn't seem enjoyable for me. Gloomhaven falls short of my expectations and I really wanted to like this. I feel like it's a "Robo Rally" pre-programming, diminishing-deck dungeon crawler, that has too much cerebral deck-analysis that feels too rushed and thinky to be fun. (BTW, Robo Rally is not my cup of tea.) 

I played this in two-players mode after we researched how to optimize characters. 

My biggest displeasure with Gloomhaven is it's pace.  It's more of a dungeon blaze-through then a dungeon-crawl explorer.  The pace of going through each dungeon is too rigidly "forced" upon the players by limiting your hand-size via a diminishing or deconstructing hand mechanism. It's a deliberate fast-paced timer which reinforces that "rushed sense of urgency" in nearly ALL scenarios. Again, it feels very artificial to me.  It seems that the lowest/weakest hand-sized character really dictates the party's speed or pace for how quickly the party needs to move through each dungeon or else risk running out of cards. Now, that's indeed a very sad way of failing as true Adventurers!  "Oh, no!   We failed b/c our (wizard or rogue) ran out of (wait for it...) ....cards?!?"  The difficulty of the dungeons are usually very difficult, and in combination with the amounts of time it takes to administer all the components/card decks and the fast-paced at which you need to rush into each scenario (hand limitations), that really offsets most of the other fun factors that I liked about it.  Thus, it diminishes or minimizes my overall enjoyment in contrast with the length of this type of game.  

The "not being able to trade items" with fellow party members, and other quirky rules, does not make any thematic or realistic sense either.  They're just "Euro rules" thrown in to "balance" things out so the system can't be exploited.  In other words, the system is kind of broken-ish and uses Euro rules to tweak it together.  I expect better from thematic dungeon/adveneture games.  

I also did not feel like there was high amounts of a co-op aspect.  It feels like if you are the character w/ the lowest or weakest hand/size/management, then you dictate what you "need" to do and everyone else has to (co-op) "work around" that player's circumstances.  It's more a co-op for everyone else, really.  

For the high volume time commitment spent playing it, I feel that I received little benefit gained for my character via the gaming experience.  (At least for the first three levels.  Maybe it's a better game for high level characters but I don't wish to spend the time to get there.) 

The production quality of this is mostly outstanding but as a dungeon'fantasy design, it falls flat to entertain me fully with a rich, dungeon/fantasy adventure gaming experience - - especially with the likes of other great games such as:  Descent, Mage Knight, D&D Ravenloft / Drizzt / Ashardalon series, Legends of Andor series, Mice & Mystics, etc. just to name a few in comparison.  I would also count games like Star Wars Imperial Assault, War of the Ring and Star Wars Rebellion as "similar games".

Now, I do enjoy a great deal of Euro games and own many in my collection.  But, in retrospect, I think usually I'll much prefer Thematic-dungeon crawlers over Euro-dungeon crawlers like Gloomhaven.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

The rules may not be organized in my preferred style, but most of the information is present if you can find it. The quantity of materials in this game is amazing and the game mechanics are solid. I appreciate the timing mechanic of losing a card from your deck every time you rest - once you are out of cards, you are knocked out/die. The aspect of playing two cards and taking a top and bottom action creates some angst and difficult decisions. The characters feel uniquely different in how they play. Wish it played five. Games will take a while - if we ever play all 90 scenarios, I'd be shocked...:-) Curious to see how long it takes to retire someone.

RATING: 9.5
Initial rating (9.5): This is one of the best dungeon crawler games I have ever played. It is exciting and thematic like an Ameritrash game, but at the same time as puzzly and mechanically challenging like a Eurogame. On top, it is co-operative and each class plays differently. Looking forward playing some more!

Update:  Brilliant game.  I play with my 4 boys and we can't get enough of Gloomhaven.  One of the things I like best about the game is that there is little to no downtime between rounds.  The reason is you are always looking for the next best combo for what you want to accomplish and you are always engaged in the game.  So far, one of my all time favorite games!

I can't wait to get my hands on the 2nd edition of Gloomhaven.  I will circle back to my rating once I get the game and start playing...  But from what I have seen and read, this will be a 10 star game for me!

I can see how this is a phenominal game. If I were still a teenager with tons of free time, this would be a more appealing style of game for me, perhaps. But really, the theme is what kills this game for me. Different strokes... This just doesn't do it for me.

Good review: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1718321/gloomhaven-first-impressions

"Overly simplistic AI
Brain dead AI, with overly simple movement. I haven't played many coop dungeon crawls. But the ones I have (like galaxy defenders) have wildly better AI, that makes the enemies more that a damage generator with lots of theme.

soblue Rarely exciting gameplay
Pretty much all the excitement inside the box comes from the unknown. During gameplay it's a repetitive and dry. 

soblue Feels like a giant game of grinding
It's so repetitive. As stated there may be tons of monsters, but they don't change things enough. It's do abilities for damage and hope for good card flips. Over and over and over and over and over. 

soblue Level design feels way behind the competition 
I played 20 scenarios. Other than a couple, most felt exactly the same. Rarely did they add to the story either. That leaves most (not all) just blah dungeons. Something like imperial assault has every mission feel different and more importantly, play different. I believe the designer said he hasn't played other dungeon crawls, I think he should have. This hurts theme and gameplay. 

soblue Box isn't big enough
A huge box that doesn't hold everything. Crapolo. 

soblue Long set up and tear down
Even with the best organization ideas I could think of, this game is a giant pain to set up and tear down. 

soblue The red/brown color is over used. It's everywhere. Overall Ugly. 
Art is obviously subjective. I'm not impressed. Worse is the tiles. They look good on their own, until every dungeon is either reddish brown or blue. 98 scenarios that all look the same...

soblue Town part of the game is unimpressive
The town part sounded so cool. But really it's just an event. And they are pretty random. Some don't even offer good choices, it's a lot of do nothing, or do something. That's not really a choice. Anyways, Town is not nearly as fleshed out and cool as video game RPGs it was trying to emulate. 

soblue Baffling decision to remove the color coded system for map overlays, that are still present in the rulebook. 
Takes longer to find and set up. And have to constantly remind players what type of terrain they are.

soblue Enemy organization is a mess. Needed boxes like the heroes.
Even with envelopes, it's a pain."

"""
“Main Storyline”, 45 scenarios in the game

retirement keeps you from getting bored with playing the same character (read: 10+-3 cards) for the entire campaign

The classes feel highly different

What was especialy great about Gloomhaven: Character Drop-In / Drop-Out. We had two guestplayers - one played on the beginning weekend, and didn’t finish his life goal (so his character is still on stand-by). 

Another positive thing that I'd like to mention is, most classes don't have a obvious "optimal build" - most of the times, you realy look hard between your newly unlocked action cards, ponder on wich to take, then ponder hard on wich of your beloved cards to take out for it. 
"""

Notes
- Big box. Some problems with the components, but not too big. 
+ ennemies have a personality. 
- I am not a huge fan of dungeon crawlers. Of fight and loot. Of campaigns .
+ investing each single card in an action feels hard. I like this effect in Race.
- Long setup
- Repetitive
+ Retirement helps not getting bored with same character in campaign
+ Player drop-in/out
+ Unlocked action cards not overpowered
+ Classes feel highly different

Conclusion
- The repetitiveness can really bother me

Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for travelling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.

This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions.

Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

Essentially, every turn a player will play two cards out of their hand. Each card has a number at the top, and the number on the first card played will determine their initiative order. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player’s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.

This game is a gem, with so many mechanics working so well together. While I would have loved for this game to have miniatures for all the enemies, it wouldn't have worked with the game as it is now, too many enemies, means that the box would have been at least twice the size(of this already giant of a game). Isaac would properly be printing money if he released creature packs.

Pros:
Only legacy game worth playing
Really good mechanics
Pretty hard gameplay
Medium play time(per session)
Lots of content
Nice artwork
Good value for money
Too much stuff in the box

Cons
No minis for enemies
Too much stuff in the box

Would have rated this a 9, but got to give it a +1 for all those ppl who downrate due to their preorders being cancelled. This have nothing to do with the game and if Isaac where to blame it's for not being a psychic and knowing that he should produce lots of games. Come on his company is really small and he did play this safe by not going all in on a game that could fail(but didn't). He will properly do another print run and you will be able to get this fine game.

Update: We have tried the campaign, and I have to accept it is quite interesting. We still haven't tried everything the game has to offer, (like the achievements we unlocked didn't affect the game's mechanics, but we'll see) but I already considering changing the rating to an 8.

20+ games in and I'm still hooked. Recently played it multiple times a week and it's still going strong.
I don't know if the constant fighting will grow old over time but as there are many very different classes jet to be unlocked and a story accompanying the game I have high hopes that our group will play it for another while. One of my most played games recently.

Gloomhaven is my favorite boardgame. It's a Euro style co-operative dungeon crawler with some legacy aspects. The content in this game is monstrous and makes it so fun to play because you always want to discover more! The gameplay is very nice with the double actions cards and the character classes are very original and offers great variable player powers. It is so fun to customize your characters and see them becoming more and more powerful as the game progresses. I like how you can custom difficulties and that reward values are according to the scenario level you play. The game is hard and it feels more rewarding in that sense when you finally complete a scenario you tried a couple of times.

Campaign #1 - Solo : 
Spellweaver Lvl 6, Summoner Lvl 5 and Sunkeeper Lvl 4

Campaign #2 - Multiplayer :
Alou, Gab, Philty, Vince et Léger
Brute Lvl 1, Tinkerer Lvl 1, Scoundrel Lvl 1, Spellweaver Lvl 1 and Mindthief Lvl 1

Mechanically very interesting dungeon crawler - for my money this has completely replaced Descent and to some degree Imperial Assault (mostly because I really like Star Wars).

The AI is very nicely done and provides a competent and varied challenge. The campaign is clearly a massive body of work with its interconnected storylines and branching quests.

...and the size of that box. And it's packed to the brim!

It does everything Descend does, but worse. Fiddly, slow and ugly. I didn't like the core card mechanics at all. It feels very limiting. On my turn I could move and attack or attack and move. Or rest, which is basically "you loose a turn". Mostly uninteresting decisions during looong and boring combat full of health tracking and dial spinning. World map and card events are very nice though.

admittedly only played one random dungeon and no scenario yet. in the end a stupid random draw of a battle card and f*y*.. can't kill the last stupid monster and you're dead because out of cards.

25 hours into the game, played over two weekends. The story line is interesting, side quests (more of an additional quest line?) are available to change the pace. My family is enjoying the progression of story and characters, and we look forward to playing on the weekends. 

Some cons: minis are not the best, but paint up nicely enough. Components are OK, and my copy seems to be free of manufacturing defects described by others. Set up time is significant; I purchased the Broken Token insert which helps. 

Still, it is an excellent game experience. I can't wait to get back into Gloomhaven and will probably auto-buy all additional scenarios and expansions.

Likely the best dungeon crawl I've ever played. That being said, the game is hard, and doesn't hold your hand. 

Tons of content, with many non-linear ways to introduce new things and scenarios. 

I also have to say: So, the hand management of Gears of War returns? I would not have expected that.

It's a 9, and in time, may yet become a 10.

Wow, what a great time for being a gamer. I haven't made any updates or reviews on BGG for a long time, but recently not one but two games have inspired me to do so (Gloomhaven and Kingdom Death). These games have surpassed any expectation I had, and have redefined gaming for me.

Gloomhaven is an amazingly great tactical dungeon crawler with campaign and legacy elements (unlocking things as you go). The best part is the game play itself is worthy of a 10. The campaign and legacy parts are bonus. The top/bottom card play is awesome. The system of discard versus lost for played cards works wonderfully.

Kickstarter - standee edition.  It was good, but ultimately we weren't interested in committing to the full campaign (having a 7 month old with a headcold during our first few plays didn't help).  Kathleen is also much more interested in her dungeon crawls being more visceral and dice-driven rather than the action card selection GH presented.  I think perhaps her response to Mage Knight should've been a warning away from this, but I so hoped.  I liked it well enough, and it is certainly a well-designed and produced game, but it just wasn't going to get played.

Played about 15 scenarios so far, experiencing 6 character classes (2 players, each of us controlling 2 characters, 2 retirements so far). It took about two scenarios to get the hang of the mechanics; especially your hand of cards being the scenario timer, how you avoid getting killed (exhausted), and how you perform actions, but it also took a short while for the enemy AI to become intuitive. But, here i am, and i can say with confidence this is an incredible game, easily in the top five i've ever played. I'm a huge fan of Mage Knight board game because of its ingenious complexity, mechanics, and puzzle-like take on RPGs. I'm also a fan of Descent 2ed because of how fun it is to play with a group of people and scratches the classic dungeon crawler fix with typical Fantasy Flight quality and quantity of expansions. To me, Gloomhaven is almost the ideal combination of Mage Knight and Descent 2ed.

After two scenarios I can see what the hype is about. Gloomhaven is extremely immersive, combining the character building aspects and evolving world of an RPG with more control and hard decision making of using cards rather than rolling dice, like Mage Knight for example.

RATING: 10
Even though I love the game I'll start with the bad:
- story choices in road and city events are really obvious like 'help or steal' 'protect or kill', there is no moral ambiguity. Your evil or bad choices should be subjective and not universally bad. You shouldn't be forced to be either good  or bad to everyone. That's a really traditional aspect of storytelling. 
- Like many said - set up take really long. The game wasn't though out in a way to reduce visual clutter. Just for ability cards you need 5 zones (discard, lost, active, being played and hand). You either need to use some replacement parts (like dice instead of life chits) or get a really big table. 
- Tracking choices is hard. And even if you write down what is this scenario should lead to, you can open the scenario book and find out that it is locked by some achievement you haven't heard yet. Map serves a purpose of tracking your campaign progress but after a while you will fail to remember what place is what. 
- Rules are well written but still contain many quirks. You can be certain at least some rules. Instead of expanding the FAQ, Isaac could have add some reminder text on cards to help you understand how to use them - the cards are quite big, have no art and usually there is plenty space. 

Despite all that the game is really, really good. 
- The combat, it's core, is fun and challenging. Choosing what cards to loose for good, predicting how will the enemies move, optimizing your moves with other players - engrossing.
- the progress really feels deserved - going forward a single level easily takes 3 or more scenarios and when you do level up it unlocks so much that it makes a difference. 
- the scenarios are well thought out. Many times we would win by a hair's breadth and it was so relieving to know we do not have to replay this scenario ( because it take so much time). I actually thought that the game was too hard out of the box - until I've found out I've placed too many monsters for the first scenario for the first two attempts.

RATING: 10
I waited to vote. 

Dec 6th - Received, unpacked and organized the game.

Dec 10th - Got a group of 4 together and played. In all, before reviewing, played the game 7 times with groups, and 5 times solo.

Dec 18 - Rated the game a 10. Every time I sit down to play this thing I feel like I am transported into the world. (same a watching a great movie). 

There are people complaining that the 10s are coming out as some sort of an of balance agenda. I think most of the tens, just could be, due to the fact that this game is born from extremely brilliant hard work.

The Pros for me.

• The Alpha gamer is dead here. Gloomhaven most brilliantly takes care of the MAJOR issue I have with most legacy games. That being, no one person can 'play' for everyone at the table. THANK YOU Isaac. I got sick of this with 'Pandemic' games almost immediately.

• There is a TON of game here for the price. I am shocked that this game was priced around $100. It could have been broken out into 10 different expansions and cost a whole heck-of-a lot more. 

• This turn mechanic is fantastic for dungeon crawling. It adds suspense, humor, real team work, and strategy for every turn played.

• Upgrading my character becomes a heavily desired achievement! I find myself not looking ahead at my characters future powers because the anticipation for reaching these points is a real desire. (not sure how I am going to feel about retiring one yet, have not reached this point).

• The MOST fun I have had playing a dungeon crawl with a group of equally interested players.

The Cons for me.

• The set up can be a beating. Especially solo play.

• You need a long stretch of time to really get into this game. This can be tough if you are a parent (like my entire group - but we have creatively come up with a solution that fits all, so actually wouldn't that be a good thing?). 


I love the game. If there are balancing issues, I have yet to run into anything that ruins the game. I can't imagine a game of this scope not having a few issues like that from time to time, but we have just tossed out those issues (which are very few) with "well real-life isn't fair either".

AMAZING game Isaac!! Grats on reaching number 1 - VERY well deserved.

Has a game ever truly deserved a 9 (according to BGG's description)? Well here is one. Always thinking about it. Always following the forums. Always dying to play it and discover more. Could this rating fall after the campaign ends? Maybe. But the ease of resetting your game - put in place by the designer (via the millions of files on BGG) combined with the estimated YEARS worth of play time just to finish a single campaign makes this a game I don't think I'll be abandoning any time soon...

Don't fool yourself. This game is TOUGH and ALL about efficiency. It beats you down repeatedly, which only increases the mouth-watering appeal of it. I'm dying to discover more. To immerse myself in my character. To grow and better him. To build him up until that time that he (god forbid) retires... and I'm forced to choose a new (equally compelling and potentially even cooler) character to restart the leveling process with.

This is a coop game that doesn't feel like any coop I've ever played. It feels real. I'm in this for myself, but the only way I can succeed is joining forces with other mercenaries who need to succeed as well. Can't get enough of this game, and don't see that changing any time soon. Well done, Isaac.

It is a very good game, don't get me wrong. But it's far from 10. The city phase is just boring. The combat, although pretty cool initially, gets stale after 20 hours or so. The game is an endless grind fest. I played around 30% of the campaign and it has been sitting on my shelf for the last 6 months and I just can't gather enough will to finish it.
My rate was 10 initially, then changed to 9 around 15 hours and now I'm finally changing it to 8 after 35 hours or so.

Great dungeon crawler with a lengthy and intricate campaign storyline.  But the vast majority of scenario objectives are "kill everything" and even with new character abilities and playing different characters against different monsters, this can start to feel samey.  There are also a couple things that are overly fiddly and could've used some streamlining.  So far, however, I'm really enjoying it, but my rating might drop a little over time due to these issues.

EDIT: After completing about 90% of the campaign, I'm keeping my original rating. I do still think that some mechanisms are overly fiddly and could've been streamlined. However, the varying monster AI, how some monsters can present different challenges in different layouts or when encountered with other monster combos, the changes in gameplay for the unlocked classes, and the periodic puzzles presented with scenario objectives really kept the game feeling fresh for me even after 70+ scenarios.

Gloomhaven is brilliant. It really creates a feeling of a RPG without a need for a game master. The combat is strategic and the minimised amount of luck really brings tactical thinking in the game.

All this awesomeness come with couple of caveats though. The sheer amount of components is insane and organising can be a challenge. Finding the right enemy standees is a work (unless you figure out a good way to store and sort them). Also the quality of the cards isn't as good as I hoped and I really recommend sleeving the cards that are constantly shuffled.

Dont own the game as playing friends copy.

So far really enjoying the game (at least 15 seasions through I think).  

One of the problems with coop games can be alpha player syndrom.  Admitedly that comes down to your play group and Im sure some groups would be fine with any game but not others.
The way you are only meant to share partial information and each have your own choices to make would hopefully make that not an issue with this coop game.

There is a lot to unlock in the box and enjoying that although being only able to play max of 1 scenario a week sometimes feels like you are not really advancing quick enough. That is allieviated by the different ways each scenario will force you to adapt and when one of the other players advance and you haven't you still may need to change the way you play.
The fact equipment, perks and levels all make a difference and may advance seperatly from each other helps keep things moving.

Lots of threads talk about concern over the price and the legacy aspects of the game. To me thats not a concern as if you enjoy the game you will get great value for money with all the content included.
I would avoid marking map and cards possibly if you are unsure you will like the game, until you have played a few sessions and should then have a good opportunity to judge.

A fantastic game - we played 20 Scenarios so far as a 3 Person Party. It takes a lot of time (each Scenario 3-4 hours) but we enjoy it sooo much! The only bad thing is, that we don't have enough time to play it, as often as we wished for. We used to play a lot of board games and also some AD&D in the past, but I never played something as good as this!

90% of this game is making brain-burning tactical decisions on the dungeon map. The card rotation makes it unrealistically restricted in execution. Give me Shadows of Brimstone, Descent or Imperial Assault instead. Or even a real role playing game.

RATING: 10
Most easily summarised as a mixture between Mage Knight, Dungeons and Dragons and Mansions of Madness with a legacy system and an ongoing storyline. Play mechanics are really brilliant - you've got limited amount of cards and have to use 2 of them per round - one upper and one lower part, balancing them out to ensure cards are lost when it is needed (Mage Knight part), the figure control on the map walking through tiles interacting with objects and fighting (Mansions of Madness part) all while being involved in quite a lengthy storyline that takes in your actions, opening new path and closing others (d&d, legacy). It is indeed a well-balanced game requiring deep strategical and analitical thinking on-the-go as the situation is constantly changing. Drawbacks: no first-game rulebook - you have to read the mechanics before playing, a steep learning curve since it implements lots if mechanics. However the main drawback is the fact that it is a heavy legacy game. Not only you need a permanent party willing to constantly play (unless you want to play this game for years and with different people as old ones leave) as well as wiling to learn a heavy game. Better fewer people more willing to play rather than going through a recruitment hell every time you want to play. There is a possibility of playing some parts of this game with random people that are in just for a run or two - doing side-scenarios or random dungeons but I highly recommend saving the main storyline for the permanent team. Still, I consider this as a must-have for heavy gamers that constantly have 2-4 active and willing players.

Bought Cephalofair games direct preorder.

I am completely in love with this game.  It has all of the dungeon crawly goodness I craved, without the annoying randomness of DnD or Descent (yay no dice!).  It satisfies the RPG lover in me with a huge persistent campaign with an ever changing world.  It calls to the heavy eurogamer in me with tense decision making points with the tense decision making of the card system and custom attack modifier decks.

The game manages to be challenging even on the first mission, but not impossible at 2p.  A sign of great difficulty scaling.

The only real downside is the setup (mitigated by different storage solutions).

+ Immersive persistent campaign that definitely scratches the RPG itch
+ Diceless combat system
+ Lots of customization for characters, from available action cards to custom a attack modifiers and equipment
+ Lots of classes to explore
+ Gameplay is rich and deep, often allowing requiring you to really plan and outsmart the AI
+ AI is easy to use and fairly intuitive

- Storage and cleanup/setup are a BEAST
- HP / XP tracking for monsters and players is fiddly
- There are a lot of small, easily overlooked or misunderstood rules that make the FAQ required reading

Great replayability :) It's a non-DM RPG with focus on tactical combats, but still has atmosphere, sound character development system and an epic campaign. The biggest downside is the temptation of being too loose on critical situations (in other words: cheating) as there's no DM who controls the heroes' actions, so you need some self-discipline :D

RATING: 9.5
Playing almost exclusively as a 4-player campaign with the same group of players and characters. This game takes us waaaay longer than the 2 hours per scenario advertised on the box: setup is horrendous as is tearing down afterwards; there's a significant amount of overhead in character maintenance, campaign maintenance and grabbing the right cards to use with a specific character before the scenario - as well as choosing the cards for the scenario from the active pool. However, we've radically changed the way that we do setup and this has knocked 33% off the time it takes us to cycle through a complete session. Nevertheless, it takes us a long time to play a scenario, because we approach it as a Euro, not as an Ameritrash game. Lots of thinking, optimisation and discussion.

All that being said, it ranks as one of the most enjoyable games that I've ever played. It falls just short of Arkham Horror and Concordia.

This is pretty much the best RPG/dungeon crawl game, one of my favorite types of games, I have played.  Things I love about it: it's fully co-op and not one vs. many, characters are interesting and unique (not the typical tank/dps/heals), characters level up in interesting ways (not just getting stats increases), there's some story to the campaign and character decisions fork in various ways, it can be played solo or with players coming in and out, there is a ton of content, and the game is made for value and longevity rather than nickel and diming you with small incremental expansions and bloated costs due to miniatures.

RATING: 10
Great design by Childres here. Game is an awesome dungeon crawl that makes you think of Tactic Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics converted in board games. Some of the components haves issues notably health and xp markers, but there was no way that such a massive game at such a reasonable price could have happened with all premium components. Communication and customer support by Isaac Childres have been absolutely stellar. This could be worthy of being his magnum opus and hopefully it won't be because he will design even greater games.

An absolute beast of an adventure game with a feel reminiscent of the largest video game RPGs. The card driven combat system is a refreshing alternative to dice and the varied monster AI decks remove the need for one player to player to control the adversaries. It isn't perfect, the production quality isn't the best and there are a few rules that feel a bit clunky (Invisible) but it's still a hell of a journey that fans of the genre should try.

I'm getting more into this with each play... I love the legacy aspect and the way the scenarios are linked into a cohesive story. I like the card play though prefer the card play in myth. 

The difficulty is o.k, as are the mechanics (though they detract a little from the theme in my opinion which is why this probably won't reach the same score as myth even though I enjoy this and think it is a much 'better' mechanically and written game)

Update after 9 plays - This game is still amazing...It's all we play if only 4 players show up.  It's caused us to schedule second game nights each week.    The bad part about this game is it means my other games aren't getting played.

10 - after 2 plays this is something that right now I will want to play again and again.  After playing for 3 hours, i want to leave it setup to play again.  The combat / card system is just so enjoyable.  The stress of deciding when to use the powerful cards.  The agony of seeing a miss or -2 draw.  The joy of seeing a 2x.  This game...fantastic.

Production value is amazing and the amount you get for money is insane you could play this for a solid year every day easy to unlock everything.

However despite the Euro mechanics it still falls short with the random modifier decks ranging from your attack doing 0 damage to x2. In a game where burning cards is very important and every play counts its just unacceptable.

Its also very complex for a game with so many random factors and a real head F to play solo balancing 2 characters

This is the first time I rate a game on BGG. I've got tons of games of all genres but this one deserves my first ten! Luckily I am in a group of other geeks and heavy gamers, who also like RPGs and LARP. We've played now 15 Scenarios and all of theme were interesting and tense, nailbiting thrilling and some of them were won on the edge. This one is really cooperative, together you outline schemes and then you execute them properly, otherwise ... The AI of the bad guys is the best system I have ever seen in such a game. This will be hard to top! So what else to say: the game entertains, is compelling and full of interesting decisions: No dice, a bit of randomness comes through cards you use during fights, but not too much, just enough for some tactical  decision-making. Core Engine of the game is the mechanism of the ability cards, which you play during your turn and which gives every character a really unique way how to play. Well, there are so many more amenities so i really don't know, where to start and where to end. To me this game is the essence of a good game with no flaws at all. Still I recommend to all the gamers, who are looking for a short, light Dungeon Crawler with beer and pretzel feeling: hands off.

Meh! Hand made video game with an original system of play. Some design decisions make the experience uncomfortable. No DM or Overlord, so when you put the map in the table you can see all the traps and closed stances in the "adventure" (No exploration at all). Totally unnecessary legacy system (Why i must destroy a big map of the game world when i could mark the places that i discovered in a expendable map of paper?). The quest book is not properly bound (Spiral bound, seriusly? In a game of 120 $?). Only miniatures for the heroes and cardboards for the monsters. Extremely big and ugly monster cards and a so and so...

Rating based on 2 player games using also the companion app.

This is probably the thematic campaign dungeon crawler I have waited for years. Somehow it managed to solve the very difficult tradeoff between simple and streamlined rules and an engaging campaign. I like also the tension created by not sharing all the information, objectives, items and gold. 

Of course, having a quite strong story line, I am wandering how replayable it could be after the end of the campaign (this is an issue for many other similar games). Also I am having some issues with the components (monsters and tiles falling apart) which, hopefully, will interest only a small percentage of them.

Well, it was fun and all but I don't see the over-the-top adulation of this game.  A loosely connected series of tactical combats.  The combat is entertaining enough, and has some clever twists and ability to alter your deck a bit to customize.  The timing mechanism of the game also works well.  Interesting to open envelopes and all when there are new findings.  However, I'm not sure the continual combat stuff would keep me coming back for ninety odd episodes, but I would play again a few times.  Also, 90-120 minutes to fight out three or four rooms feels like a lot, especially given the setup time.  The box certainly is impressively enormous with a lot of content, so you don't get cheated there.  Nice spiral bound encounter booklet.  Not sure about the need for stickers and all that stuff, but I suppose there is no reason to play scenarios twice.  The story holding it together rather rudimentary.

Amazing game. Feels like a perfect marriage between computer RPGs and the mechanisms and strategy of board gaming. Wonderful character customization options, an awesome branching and sometimes permanent decision questing system, and more controlled tactical decisions than any other game of this kind I have played. The skill combo system is SO satisfying. Adding in that this is a legacy system is just the icing on the cake.

A 10 just for packing!  Components very good, then the reading the rulebook, you know a great experience was coming.  7 games played (2 do overs on a side quest) and myself and my two 20 something daughters just love this game.  So well put together!  Playing Spellweaver, Brute and Scoundrel, good combination, and after 7 games we all feel like we are kinda of getting our potential...but then again!

Board game speculation. Not an activity I intended to embark upon, but very much what happened here. I made something like a 200% return on the Kickstarter cost, selling my unopened copy only weeks before the second printing opened up. 

That said: the gameplay itself is grand. The game seamlessly goes from large board map growth in the Legacy style... to Final Fantasy-style descending into combat with turns and a grid map. The storylines intersect and cross paths; and the characters have randomly-assigned goals and motivations, so it isn't even a case of choosing your own character-adventure. You get to unlock and unfold the existing stories, and the order of activities is not vital. A great game, I hope to someday pick up a copy at retail when I have a consistent gaming group, and just dive in.

This is based on playing through the first few scenarios and playing with three friends who were brand new to board games. Can take some time to get through a scenario when playing with a total group of four but still extremely rewarding. The theme and theatrics of it all really brought it to life.

Amazing game. Grew tired of table top RPGs but this game has filled that itch that they still give me.  Do not go looking for a role playing experience but if you enjoy the combat and strategy of table top RPGs you may enjoy this.

I don't know if this game deserves the 10s its getting but I doubt few games exist that truly deserve a 10 and at that point maybe it is justified.

Went ahead and joined in on the kickstarter.  I totally stink at rolling dice--something very akin to the Wil Wheaton affect (I still remember how I basically lost all hope of winning early in a game of Eclipse by losing dice roll after dice roll in a long engagement I should have won!) so a game where there are no dice and I can make my attacks strategically via choosing cards is very appealing!   

2/2/18:  Wow! There is so much to this game. I've spent about 12 hours playing so far and this could go on for a long, long time.  The Black Barrow is a bit of a slog--I've played it 4 times and we finally made it through, after bringing the opponent level down to 0.

Not wowed by it yet. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a solid game, has a lot of theme, a good system, and a ton of content. It’s got some nice artwork, but not fantastic. The cardboard components feel just slightly cheap compared to a dungeon crawl with more plastic or made by a company with a little higher production values. I think the value comes from the overall impact of everything together, especially after some regular campaign play. That’s where I’m not sure I fit the target audience. I will likely get most of my plays solo, and while it is still enjoyable (and there is available solo material as well), it seems best with a regular group. It remains to be seen whether I will be able to fully appreciate these aspects and whether my rating will go up with further play. However, it will not likely go down. My initial impression is that I like the card management and that this will be a satisfying adventure game for most.

Game rating is based on a single game play (scenario 1) but probably will go up when finishing more scenario's. The amount of material is out-of-this-world and the most I've seen in any game. The box is huge so you get a lot of bang for the buck. It seems very chaotic on how to play the game at first but halfway the first scenario all pieces fit together and you get more experience on how to play the game. I thinks this game grows on you and only gets better after the first couple of plays. Looking forward to go through the scenario's with my wife.

I gave it a 7 because of the sheer scope of this game, but ultimately it did not work for my family.  Too much to keep track of and micro manage, with not enough payoff.  Great for some, not for us.  Still, I find it to be one of the boldest games ever to be made.

Gloomhaven seems to be the first game that scratches that RPG itch without the need for a game master. Most of the fun stuff of RPG's is in there and the scenario book allows for many, many hours of fun. It might seem expensive but this game is in itself a hobby.

RATING: 10
I have had two game sessions with the game now. In the first session me and my friends managed to just barely make it through the first scenario. Second session we first went to the Barrow Lair and then we all wanted to not to stop (even when the clock was well past a good session ending time) and went to the next scenario. My friends have been impatiently asking me about when will we continue our journey and I feel the same. I have never had this kind of an effect in any of the board games I've played.

I love how balanced it feels. I have played some PnP RPG in the past and I would not compare that to this. It still has some optional similarities, like I love how we the players can flavor the things we do as an action, like we do when we play D&D, Ars Magica etc.

I know I will most likely lower my rating once we've played the game far enough, but at the moment the game is as good as the "hype" I had previously seen. To be honest, I did not expect me to like it this much.

Pre rating post: 2nd print all sleeved, Laserox inserted and ready to start playing. A date is set with my friends to start the campaign.

Gloomhaven fully realizes the vision to which Mice and Mystics aspired but failed.  What you have in Gloomhaven is a tactical minis game bookmarked by story elements in an ongoing campaign - where you can level-up in unique and interesting ways.  All 3 aspects are well implemented in Gloomhaven.  The cardplay at heart of the tactical minis game is quite thinky and fun.  The opponent AI system results in dynamic and surprising board states.  It's very good.  The level-up system is also very well done and makes you feel like you are working through a tech-tree.  But many of the branches are viable and all of them are interesting.  The story seems well written, but it is not a huge draw for me (yet?).  Personally, I don't care that much about the bits of story.

Gloomhaven has some great card strategy and deck building elements, but it is initially very slow and suffers from repetitiveness.  I initially did not like my first few games due to overly simple plots and limited variety.  The story and strategy grew on me, but over time I would call this game samey in a way that many will hate.  It plays pretty similar to Mage Knight, but simpler, so if you like solving card puzzles with deck timers, this will be the game for you.  They're different enough for some people to buy both, but I'd play this with a group before purchasing if you think this is going to play like an RPG like AD&D; it is not.  At heart, this is more of a strategy game.  You can only slightly deck-build, but there's a decent variety between the characters.  The narrative is less hit than miss, which is unfortunate, but an imaginative group can add a lot.  
The worst elements are that unlocking cards, new characters, and equipment is very slow compared to many games.  If the prosperity didn't allow new characters to start at higher levels, I would easily house-rule it, because the starting characters drudge along painfully.  I'd start newbies at level 2 or 3 to avoid them disliking the game.  An organizer for setup and tear down is a good investment.  
There's a decent variety in the enemies and their AI deck actions.  There are a plethora of scenarios to play, but they are relatively samey.  The best part of this game is the ability to control the balance of the game no matter the number of, or change out, of players; a variable player group will get this to the table more than many games.  The best player count really depends on the individuals!  Similar to Mage Knight, there are times where players may have dozens of choices and slow the course of play.   
I thought that Pandemic Legacy Season 1 was a much better game, but I prefer more legacy elements, and PL had fantastic strategy changes.  The Gloomhaven character progression is too slow and game-play too repetitive for me to vote this higher, but this game could be great in the right group that invests in unwritten narratives and just has fun in coop games.  If you find the game samey, I'd suggest adding an experience multiplier (multiply by 2) to increase faster level changes, and I'd open more items for purchase faster (open all normal items).  That will create more freedom and change in the strategy.
Edit:  OK, this grew on me once my characters were past level 5.  I changed my rating from a 6 to an 9.  Once you're at higher levels, you can gain experience faster and build more complicated decks.  With a full complement of good gear and blessings from the city, you're pretty powered up. I enjoyed the increase in deck-, play-, and scenario-options and even say this is better than Mage Knight.

Right now my party and I are going crazy over this game. We've only played 3 scenarios, but I suspect this will be the only game we'll play for a few weeks to come (and that is downright impressive). I don't want to give it a 10/10 yet, because I want to wait to get a bit of an aftertaste of it.
Update: We're like ~20 scenarios deep and we all still love it. We still have classes to unlock and all that. I'm afraid we're near the end of the campaign, but there seems like there will be a TON of user-generated content, so this game may last forever. My only gripe with this game are the map tiles; they're hard to fit into the box and hard to sort through for each set-up.
Here's a 4-month later update: We're near the end of this game's lifetime even though we've only played ~50 scenarios. I think this game really suffers from too many components. We play with the app, but there's still soooo much set-up time. I'm just getting tired of all of the pieces I have to manage.
6-month update: We haven't played this game in a while. I am way too sick of the set-up time to keep playing this game. What a hassle.

It's taken several plays to get to grips with all the pieces and rules in this game, but I think we're now over the hump and I find that I'm more and more eager to play the next scenario. I wish there was a way to shorten the setup time though, but the freedom of choice means that the party needs to be together to decide where to go next.

played TTS mini campaign and that 1% of the whole game blew me away

The following is a reply to the only person who rated it a one without just saying "balance"  the text inside the (parentheses) is the 1 star rating minus some of the useless ranting.  read the full version yourself you you want.  not hard to find since this game has so few 1stars

(The over-hyped, ginormous box of disappointment that will appeal to people who need an RPG cheat code. Nothing says "adventure" like reading your dungeon master's scenario before ever playing it. With Gloomhaven you will never be surprised by the location of traps, treasure or monster encounters ever again because you will know exactly where they all are before you even start. What a challenge!)

I have also used pnp cards and heroscape terrain to create a proxy board game experience.  Even with this hodgepodge grayscale edition the core play is solid.  Knowing where everything is seemed odd at first but the difficulty of the game shows this has already been taken into account.  Also a simple search for gloomhaven hidden will give you an interactive PDF that blocks out future rooms and event text until you get to that point.  Very well done and worth the download. 


(When paying over $100 for a board game, a box this big better be stocked full of miniatures but sadly it is not and you only get them for your characters.)

I too would love minis in the game for everything but as this game is already huge, 250+ minis would give this game a larger footprint then Zombicide black plague.  That is the ENTIRE black plague KS with all the expansion items.  A full mini version would take a room unto itself.

(This nonsense continues with the amateurish looking world map that has areas titled: "Dagger Forest, Watcher Mountains, Merchant's Bay, Misty Sea, Lingering Swamp, Still River and yes even Serpent's Kiss River." Those do not even sound believable for a fantasy setting. It is as if the designer asked some kids in 5th grade to name everything in the game.)

no comment other then it really doesn't bother me

(Speaking of which, nothing says fun and excitement like putting stickers on your game components to play a "legacy" game and destroying its ability to be replayed. It must remind players of those oh so cool gold stars they would get in elementary school.)

I did not like the idea of legacy games myself but this one is laughably easy to "reset"  simply do not rip up the cards and put enhancements on the sleeves of a card.  a simple sheet of paper can keep track of the parties position on the world map.  Yes after approx. 400 hours of game I might need to print a new enhancement sticker sheet,  but I will burn that bridge 400 hour from now.

(I've seen reviews falsely calling this "D&D in a box" which is a disingenuous, it is not possible for any board game to be compared to an RPG when you lack fundamental character creation. Most dungeon crawl board games are devolved, uninspired RPGs that rip out what made them unique and leave in a pre-made, scripted and poorly designed shell.)

Is this D&D in a box?  As a 20 year DM I can say not even close.  Is it the best campaign style dungeon crawler I have ever come across?  Yes even with only 3% of a hacked version the answer is yes.  certainly the best full co-op one on the market.

(Gloomhaven is much worse than a traditional RPG and most other dungeon crawl board games since it allows you to effectively cheat by knowing the entire layout of a scenario ahead of time. This includes every location you will move into, where all the treasure is located, where all the traps are located and where all the enemies are located that you will be fighting. What is the point of a trap if you know where it is? Having an unfair advantage like this should appeal to people who are poor tacticians yet falsely believe themselves to be "tactical geniuses" and maybe that is why people are raving about this game.)

Try it.  Cannot tell you how many times your carefully laid plans were messed up when an enemy draws an 8 initiative when we were all expecting mid 50s like the rest of its deck. 

(Thinking a game mechanic is "clever" has nothing to do with tactics and nothing about the laughable two card combat system is tactical let alone clever. Using the top and bottom portions of two cards in combat is a handicapping, nonsensical mechanic that stands as one of the worst combat systems I have ever seen implemented in a board game. There is no logical reason why running would prevent me from backstabbing someone on a later turn simply because it was on the same card that has already been used. All this does is add a worthless puzzle mechanic to combat.)

Yes, yes it is a puzzle.  An amazing unique approach to tactical combat. This is kind of the whole point of the combat side of the missions.  If this is a problem for you then you do not want this game.

(While the attack modifier deck is just a lame excuse not to use dice with modifiers that is prone to abuse by failing to properly randomize it due to poor shuffling.)

The customization ability of this deck may well see the end of the d20.  once you understand it elegance the adaptions for it make D&D 3.5 stacking modifiers seem silly.  Again 20year DM and HUGE gaming enthusiast admitting this here.  I love my dice but wow!  this deck concept may be the future.

(Then we have the character classes where most are not in the least bit original but merely synonyms of standard classes with race prefixes (Brute = Fighter, Scoundrel = Thief, Spellweaver = Mage etc...) Don't fear though, as you can later unlock exciting new classes like the "Human Sawbone" - I cannot make this stuff up.)

again names don't bother me.  However; the game play of each hero does not hold to any stereotype whatsoever.  all heroes are a blend of at least two main archetypes and each one is a unique and inviting challenge to master and then customize 

(Implementing the absolutely worst idea in the history of board gaming, Gloomhaven has people (owners of the game) talking about "leveling up" characters via solo play and then bringing them buffed up to their co-op sessions. Really? Who was the referee to make sure they either actually did what they said, did not cheat, took liberties with the rules or even just innocently played certain rules wrong? You mean to tell me if someone who just spent many hours leveling up a character on their own time gets that character killed and with no one around to see are not going to give themselves a "do-over"? Who is to stop someone from just declaring the characters are so without doing anything at all? Oh my friends you do not know human nature.)

and here is a prime example of unfiltered rant.  ignore everything in the above section as non of it is true or relevant to this game.

(For over $100 and a box the size of a microwave oven you get to fight against a bunch of cardboard standees while you struggle to keep track of your hit points with a micro-wood counter that either constantly falls out of place or does not fit.)

cardboard standees vs minis: see above
wood counters:  first valid point I have seen in this post, and already fixed in the reprint.

(Speaking of bad game design, when you get a big box you get everything BIG! Including the oversized '70s era plastic stands for the cardboard standees that obscure a third of the artwork and give the game an aura of dollar store quality.)

Also true but not really any effect on game play.

(But hey, you did get that BIG box right? Only a game like "Gloomhaven" can have a box so big yet be so poorly designed that you cannot fit everything back into it without taking a Japanese origami course.)

and yet you want another 250+ pieces?  Im sorry are you upset that the game is too big or not big enough?


Final review.  STILL A TEN and that's with proxy components to boot.

Plus points:
Clever card combat mechanic - you deck build and draw 2 cards each of which has an upper and lower action. You pick the upper from one cad and the lower from another. One is usually an attack and the other movement or special.
Characters really do feel like they are advancing and gaining experience ad levels.
Character classes are superb and not the usual Cleric, Paladin etc
Negatives:
Combat is very slow and even with experience I cannot think that you would get a room done in less than 45 minutes.
The tile artwork is bland. Not much terrain etc. and not at Descent standards.
Overall:
It does take Descent to the next level with character development but the town stuff is the same level, the artwork worse and the slow progress makes it feel a real slog. I enjoyed the game and can understand how others like it, but I would rather play Descent, especially as it now has the App.

Amazing game that lived up to the hype.  I am blown away by the sheer scope and dept from a solo designer, congrats Isaac.  Solid game play w/ meaningful decisions and very little reliance on luck. The "legacy" aspects make me want to rush right into the next mission just to see what I'll unlock next.  If i have any critique is that I'm not a huge fan of the element system (the idea is awesome but the execution is a bit fiddly, that said i'm only 5 missions in).  Also set up is a bit of a task, but should improve when I have everything properly organized.  The initial learning curve is a bit steep, but the tutorial videos provided on the games site and youtube channel are phenomenal. Is it work buying and learning? @Stormknight - Yes, yes it is, and you will thank me when you give it a chance.

RATING: 10
I'm happy to say that this game has actually LIVED UP TO ALL THE HYPE!!!

Just 1 play, but that is enough for me to know that this game is a 10 for me!!!

I'm also happy that this is the 1 "legacy" style game I decided to settle on acquiring.

PROS:  If you are looking for a Thematic Fantasy, fun, exciting, cooperative and smart (plenty of tough decisions to make) game to play.  This is it!!!  Mage Knight is the only other Fantasy themed game that approaches the GENIUS of this game.  But the story telling and amount of scenarios in this game lifts it above Mage Night.  I've never played a game with so many "fist bumping" happy event moments (just in our first game).

CONS:  Rules density.  LOTS of rules.  We are talking close to Mage Knight level of rules.  However, they are well written.  Everything is easy to understand (for the most part) and makes sense (for the most part).  HIGHLY recommend rules summary from Alex Florin in BGG files section.  These are a MUST since they include some FAQ updates.  Lots of things to remember, and this concise yet detailed rules summary make it easier to get the rules in the hands of every player.  Speaking of which, this game is probably best at 3.  With 4 there would likely be too much down time between turns, and with fewer than 3 probably more difficult to successfully complete scenarios and a feeling that the scenarios are lacking a bit of something (just my guess).

Outside of that, your first few games will take a while longer, as rules are digested/clarified and players become familiar with their class ability cards.

I played one scenario, substituting for a someone who wasn't able to make their campaign.  Even with one game under my belt, I am impressed! (And don't get me started on the massive amount of stuff this game comes with)! Gloomhaven is intricate game but playes very smoothly.  The creature AI works great and they have their own personalities.  It comes with a campaign map that gets location stickers added as you discover them - very much like RPG videos games such as Skyrim.  If I wasn't so heavily invested in Frostgrave right now, I'd pick this game up in a heartbeat.

Really wanted to like Gloomhaven more than I did, especially since I kickstarted it. Much like the designer's other game, however, Forge War, this felt like more work than fun. The card play is very neat, and I like how the game manages to simulate a Disgaea-like game without dice. Furthermore, I feel like the story has some real potential, and the characters all feel very unique.

That being said, I'm not sure why I would ever choose to play this over something like Fire Emblem. I played through 4 scenarios, and with setup and take-down time, I was clocking in at about 2 hours a scenario, which is frankly too much. Despite all of Gloomhaven's little innovations, it still feels bloated and very fiddly. Setup is a real chore, especially since the game lacks much of an insert at all, and you better hope you have a large table for everything. 

My philosophy with board games lately is, why play a slower-paced, inferior version of something you could just play a very similar experience to in video game format? That is my chief reason for not liking Gloomhaven as much as I probably should. For as much as I love the complex yet simplified combat and the character development, the game just doesn't return the investment of time I put into it. Also, I feel like the legacy aspect is almost non-existent. You sticker the board and occasionally cards, but not in any meaningful way.

I looked through some of the higher level stuff, and it does look like grinding your characters eventually pays off. At the same time, it's really difficult and fiddly to keep track of all the status effects. Call me lazy, but I don't think games need to be this convoluted anymore. I'll also mention that while the rule book gets the concepts across, it reminded me of the Xia rule book, where it was more like a reference guide than an adequate way to learn the game.

Oh well...my quest continues for the game that scratches both my Fire Emblem and dungeon crawl itches in board game form. Zombicide is the closest thing so far, but its scope is pretty limited. I can see groups enjoying Gloomhaven over multiple, multiple plays, but I'll take it one step further; Why play this when you can just play a role-playing game? That's basically what this is trying to be. Unfortunately, the game feels more like work than fun, to me.

RATING: 7.5
Comparison to Mage knight is apt but reversed, you get weaker and lose options as you play. Glacial progression and slow play make for a dull game. Not what I want to experience in a game of this type. meh. Could be better with less and more experienced players. Not interested in legacy aspects.

Unbelievable game, this game is so extensive and deep. The combat is great and is somewhat similar to a puzzle. The campaign is also awesome and interesting as it gives the player the opportunity to choose different story paths which then block off other paths. To me this is great and I love the legacy aspects as there is so much stuff to unlock. 

Just a unbelievable game, one of the best games I have ever played.

Played once. Too early to rate, but here's my first impression:
Feels over-hyped. Takes too long for what it does. I think the amount of components is actually hurting the game.
The mechanisms are a mixed bag. Some things are really great, some require a lot of upkeep and feel dated.

7/10 so far.

RATING: 10
+ IMHO for now it is a best light tabletop RPG/dungeon crawl with primary focus on combat that meets tight mechanisms of Euro games 
+ no dungeon master is required
+ with a good organisation of components scenarios are quite fast to prepare and play (at least with 2 players)
+ tight cooperation among the players
+ huge variety of tactical options during combat due to the card system where all is available from the beginning
+ attack modifiers instead of dice that can be improved for each character individually
+ just a right amount of luck, especially with optional rule, that replaces misses with -2s and 2x with +2
+ gives a huge bang for the buck in terms of content in the box - from other game publishers for this amount of content you would have to add 2-3 additional expansions
+ evolving world of the game - new locations, items, characters and secret envelopes are opened once in a while

- low variety of map tiles in terms of graphic design, you have basically majority of terrain as brownish, then you have bluish and greenish:) I think this will be fixed with an expansion
- the game is a colossus so requires a lot of dedication in terms of time, preparation and in best case a stable game group is needed
- you really need to organize all the components to reduce the preparation time
- a bit fiddly mechanic of elements infusion - sometimes we forget to move them...

Quite an amazingly deep campaign system. Thoroughly enjoy the combat system, thoroughly enjoy the fantasy setting and world exploring, like how the game/world unfolds in front of you as you play. Apart from a few production quality issues, hard to fault this game. What is stopping me from 10? Simply the need to get campaign players back to the table at the same time, however the flexibility of any number of players from a party of 6 (or even multiple parties), makes this much easier to hit the table. I'm not aware of a better campaign, story-driven game.

Excellent and unique dungeon-crawler that's really a Euroish hand-management game in disguise. There's a ridiculous amount of content, but I'm dinging it a bit because it's just kind of hard to get to the table with my family - there's lots of setup and the game gets pretty brain-burny, whether co-op or solo (seems best to play three-handed when solo in order to really let the combos shine).

The core mechanic of choosing the top of one card and the bottom card that also slowly exhausts and removes your character from play is absolute genius.  The tension of wanting to play an amazing ability, but realizing that it is lost after it is used adds additional importance to every decision and action.  The tension between wanting synergistic actions working with other characters, while keeping as much gold for myself as possible makes for an entirely different kind and very interesting type of tension.  This is the game I've been waiting for.  I find myself pondering about it quite a bit.  Having completed around 30 scenarios, including six side scenarios, the genius and hard work of balancing each and every scenario astounds me.

Gloomhaven is probably the best tactical combat system ever created. I've spent years looking for something like this. I've played probably hundreds of games with tactical combat. Miniature games, RPGs, other dungeon crawlers, I'm even counting video games here and I think Gloomhaven is clearly the best. Every turn provides an interesting decisions, the classes are extremely varied and interesting with their own playstyle, something as simple as one item can enable whole new strategies and avenues of play.

But it's not just that. This brilliant tactical combat is encased in a larger game that is probably one the most comprehensive single box campaigns ever created.

It boggles the mind how a single designer working alone could make this game. Kudos to Isaac on this massive achievement.

RATING: 8
+ Great Artwork and very thematic
+ Insane amount of content. Especially for the price. Will take an age to complete.
+ Great Campaign & legacy ideas that simulate a video game RPG
+ Lovely Card Mechanics
+ Once you have a good game it is very rewarding and sticks in your thoughts.
+ Rule Book is brilliantly indexed.
- Difficult to learn, manual does little to guide new players. Keep the manual handy at all times!...
- Game rounds don't flow nicely with so many nuances that halt/slow the game play even after 25 hours play time. Even YouTube tutors make heaps of game changing mistakes and the FAQs are a becoming a compendium. Devs are great at responding to community questions though.
- Biased heavily towards losing based on luck. Most missions need several playthroughs; a couple of bad card draws and it is impossible to win (Tedious/Frustrating).
- Some of the tokens (esp hit tokens) are mis-sized but nothing major.
- Box play time is WRONG. Set up alone takes minimum 30 mins per player. General scenario set up is slow - about 45 mins before even starting.

Meh.  A friend owns the game, and I'm happy to play because he's excited about the game. However, I'm very glad that he paid for the game and not me.

Initial reaction: the whole thing feels remarkably mediocre. Maybe that's not fair; Gloomhaven does have some interesting ideas and the gameplay all works well enough. The card system for players is actually quite nice.  I'm sure the whole adventure becomes more interesting if you want to dump a ton of time into the game.

But Gloomhaven is clearly targeting a specific set of players - and it's a set that I don't belong to. Will I play again if asked? Sure. Would I ever suggest: "hey, let's play more Gloomhaven already?"... Nope.

Rating might drop over time; I have a hard time seeing it go up at this point.

Really nice game overall. Cards doubling up as action selection and a meta "health" is effevtive, with some cards giving improved abilities at a cost - removing them from the game for that scenario. Run out of cards? You're out.

Main complaint is that the scenarios are repetitive. Run into a room, kill things, loot, repeat. Upgrading characters, city and road events and adjusting the map are all satisfying though.

Been playing with a buddies copy, and have enjoyed playing the campaign so far. All of the characters feel unique in how they play, and the mind thief was definitely the right pick for me. The long term goal I think is going to take a while, since we haven't seen any of the enemies I need to kill on the list of 3 yet. 

I'm almost tempted to buy my own copy to play with another group at some point and time. I might wait till this campaign is over before I do.

Trending maybe even a bit higher but tough to say for a campaign game that early on how interesting it's going to develop.
So far I just really enjoy the main part which is the battle quiet a bit (even though there are a lot of moving parts and it cam get a bit too fiddly sometimes) and while the stuff around it is maybe a minor part of the game it adds up nicely and gives it a nice framework and some nice story pieces that are intriguing enough to keep me interested. 
I do also really enjoy the personal goals long term but also in battle as it somewhat gives the characters more of an actual character and actually helps making (story based) decisions, e.g. which quest to follow next.

I think that this game is overrated at 9.0. While it has interesting card mechanics to regulate character actions, from the perfect 10 score I have to discount:

1 point for the absurd setup and clean up time;
1 point for the forced artificial competitive mechanics that detract from group enjoyment of a cooperative game (you can see it in Pandemic Legacy for example), and for the stupid rule that you can't get the treasure after killing the monsters...
1 point for the complicated bookeeping that delays a lot the game...

and so I end up with a score of 7.

A dear friend of mine introduced me to this unique adventure that incorporates a comradeship of epic proportion. This game builds great relationships both on and off the board. I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, an expert on Gloomhaven but I have a bit of experience in "life", This "venue" is a great way to formulate friendships and enjoy the experience altogether! But; you will never know until you put forth the effort to participate, of which, I highly recommend! Before trying it myself I had a whole "different" stereotype of what a Scoundrel was! To understand what I just said; one will have to play it at least once using the Human Scoundrel...I highly recommend this game!

RATING: 9
There's a lot to love about this game. It's a tactical dungeon crawler, sure. But the decisions each turn are really hard and meaningful (unlike most dice-based dungeon crawlers which are more play-it-for-the-ride games). It can be agonising trying to get the right action combination for yourself and for the team for this moment and keep enough powder dry for future. There's just the right amount of variance for your plans to play out mostly as expected but with enough surprise to maintain tension. I've tried the random dungeon generator, but setting up each room (with new monsters) is too tiresome so I won't be pulling it out for casual gaming. However I'm a legacy campaign fan, hence the purchase, so I'm looking forward to becoming more engaged with the storyline and letting it paint a context so the game becomes more than just the tactical endeavour. If it's just glossy background, the game will diminish for me; if it can portray a real world and my position in it, the more I'll enjoy. I'll be giving it every chance.

Characters don't seem very balanced to me.

I held off for a while but this game is really deserving of a 10.
If nothing else the sheer weight and audacity of it deserves recognising but when you play it you uncover more and more how good it is.

A really tight game, every scenario to date feels won or lost by a turn. Your initial games are bewildering in options and then you begin to uncover the subtleties and card interactions - and all of this with the character progression and opening up of the game to come.

I'm really impressed with this game.  Both the thoroughness of the design required to support 90+ scenarios and the way that the game works with 2-4 players.  We're still very early into our campaign, but already starting to sort out strategy and tactics and how the different classes fit together.  A lot of variety, a lot of interesting puzzles to solve, and a game that has a well designed internal clock that puts a lot of control in the hands of the players.

This is what dungeon-crawlers should be.

Have been Playing boardgames for over 50 years.
Not only is Gloomhaven the best RPG boardgame I have played, it is the best Non-Wargame I have ever played, and probably the best game full stop.
The combat system is easily the best I have ever played.

Edit: Have now played 16 scenarios with our 3p group. If anything the game is getting better and we can't imagine wanting to play any other game at this stage. When 7th Continent arrives it will sit unplayed for quite some time.

Edit the second. Over 100 hours of gameplay and it hasn't grown stale. It's the Daddy.

I'm constantly on the lookout for a classic fantasy dungeon crawl to unseat WHQ as my go-to dungeon crawler. 

While this lacks minis (in fact, proxying them in would be more effort than it would be worth do to the numbered standees), I've the feeling based on games so far that this might dethrone WHQ finally. 

Since we are obviously still in the main campaign, I'll reserve final judgement as to whether it beats the 9.5 I rate WHQ at until we can play plenty of random dungeons, which is clearly where WHQ shines. I'm not sure this can compete there, but the main campaign is really well done so far.

It's awesome! My buddy and I will be playing for years. We don't care. The game is great. Yes, you need lots of room. We have more games played of Gloomhaven than all but one or two games in our group's hobby collection. More stories shared with our friends than since I was 12 with D&D blue box. We cannot wait for the next game. At some point we will box it up part way through the campaign, force ourselves to play other games from the shelf - those games will be fantastic in their own way, then return right where we left off, rinse and repeat. We forced our way through Risk, Pandemic, and Seafall Legacy. 16 Gloomhaven games, each fresh, tense, and story worthy. I don't play this to finish, I play Gloomhaven to play a really good immersive game. When it ends I will tell our heroes stories with all the vibrancy of my Ranger Elf tales from age 12.

RATING: 10
Incredible game. Certainly not perfect and I had hoped for more outside of the combat, but what is there is very entertaining. Haven't tired of it yet. 

The primary focus of the game is the card play for your actions and the optimization puzzle that presents. Things are dynamic enough that situation never plays out the same and you have a multitude of solutions to getting through things. It takes about 3+ play throughs to see all content. The reality is that your game is going to go differently than someone elses.

The game gives off a rpg video game vibe with branching story decision paths as well as which missions you choose to complete and when influencing how things play out. Fire Emblem/final fantasy tactics the board game? Less Baulders gate and more tactical strategy Jrpg mixed with some Mage Knight "lite". That may sound like the best thing ever to you or the worst. 

Some may prefer games like Shadows of Brimstone over this game. Certainly do your research before buying this. This is definitely a euro game design style. No dice chucking.

Looking forward to what else this designer comes up with.

The version I got was $60 from the first kickstarter. A friend of mine wants it now but he has to pay $140. Ouch. It's a great game and if I had to do it again I'd pay the $140 but no more than that.

I rate the game a 9 because the legacy aspect makes a score of 10 impossible if strictly going by BGG's ranking descriptions. However I would unofficially declare it a 10 while you are playing it.

edit: I should also note that I find this game very compelling. Probably the most compelling board game I own. I want to play this every chance I get. I want to play it like I do my most favorite computer games. I have  board games I like a lot, but nothing this compelling to date. This game is really a 10 on my list. It is one of my top 10. Certainly one of my top 5.

edit: I have since found ways to make the game non-permanent. Removable stickers and resources have made it possible for us to replay this numerous times now. So I have bumped my rating up to a 10. Seriously one of the very best games I've played and owned to date.

I've been playing D&D for a decade and a half now, and I love boardgames, but this is my first real dungeon crawling game. My roommate and I tried to make our girlfriends play D&D, but the RPG side of it didn't appeal to them. We're all big fan of legacy games, and so we thought this could maybe work with them. We're only a game in, and I'm pretty impressed by the balancing of the mechanic. It definitely feels like D&D, without the RPG and world-inventing (that I LOVE), but with a more streamlined mechanic that help us go smoothly through all the excitement of an exploration adventure.

I had both the minis and standees for this mammoth game (the box weighs in at 10kg). It is a legacy game and is excellent value, with around 100 playable scenarios. I no longer have it tho' because I was offered 4x what I paid for my copy as a KS backer. The demand for this game has been 10x the number of copies available at retail; of course, that means the game will be reprinted so I parted with my copy on the assumption that I will be able to secure a copy of the reprint/second edition.

I now have the reprint KS (backed on KS). I had previously bought a set of Removable Stickers (from Sinister Fish) in anticipation of the new game's arrival.

Best dungeon crawler. I can't find fault with this after 4 plays. Very simple actions but grueling decisions each game. There has not been a game that I have won easily. All came in very close. This is Euro mechanics meets dungeon crawler. 
Euros are usually quite bland in terms of theme but this game is soaked with it. The stories are very well written and often hilarious dialogue. The events are even better and my gaming partner have gotten a lot of good laughs from it. 
It is amazing how one designer can pull all this off. The characters are also so different in terms of how they play.
Highly recommended and I suspect it will only climb up my top 10 with each play.

The hype is genuinely well deserved, its a brilliant game with new and familiar mechanics that are really quite easy to pick up. My group is typically a dice only group who are put off by 'no die' games but this won us over completely within the first session which turned out to be 12hr long as we couldnt help ourselves from jumping into the next scenario, Its been a long while since i have been this excited and impressed by a board game. A must have for any group.

RATING: 1
[b]Don't forget to rate this a 10 when you pre-order![/b]

The over-hyped, ginormous box of disappointment that will appeal to people who need an RPG cheat code. Nothing says "adventure" like reading your dungeon master's scenario before ever playing it. With Gloomhaven you will never be surprised by the location of traps, treasure or monster encounters ever again because you will know exactly where they all are before you even start. What a challenge!

When paying over $100 for a board game, a box this big better be stocked full of miniatures but sadly it is not and you only get them for your characters. Yet somehow poor artwork, an uninspired fantasy setting and a depressingly lame game title gets this ranked in the top 100 with less than 2000 ratings? This is what happens when a good portion of the gaming community has not had the chance to properly critique an over-hyped game and the reviews only come from its Kickstarter echo-chamber.

I assume its legions of fanboys must justify their investment because when have we seen a top 100 game get over 65% perfect 10's? (Nov 2017 update: holding strong at 58%) When the #1 game on the list - Pandemic Legacy can only justify 38% perfect 10's, it may be time to implement a vote threshold above the number of Kickstarter backers a game has in order for it to reach the top 100 and reduce gaming of the BGG rankings by large crowdfunding campaigns.

I shook my head in utter disbelief watching the incredibly lame Kickstarter trailer for this game. It was nothing but a childishly recycled mishmash of fantasy cliches, yet praised as original. Have people lost their minds?

Apparently so because this nonsense continues with the amateurish looking world map that has areas titled: "Dagger Forest, Watcher Mountains, Merchant's Bay, Misty Sea, Lingering Swamp, Still River and yes even Serpent's Kiss River." Those do not even sound believable for a fantasy setting. It is as if the designer asked some kids in 5th grade to name everything in the game.

Speaking of which, nothing says fun and excitement like putting stickers on your game components to play a "legacy" game and destroying its ability to be replayed. It must remind players of those oh so cool gold stars they would get in elementary school.

I've seen reviews falsely calling this "D&D in a box" which is disingenuous, it is not possible for any board game to be compared to an RPG when you lack fundamental character creation. Most dungeon crawl board games are devolved, uninspired RPGs that rip out what made them unique and leave in a pre-made, scripted and poorly designed shell.

Gloomhaven is much worse than a traditional RPG and most other dungeon crawl board games since it allows you to effectively cheat by knowing the entire layout of a scenario ahead of time. This includes every location you will move into, where all the treasure is located, where all the traps are located and where all the enemies are located that you will be fighting. What is the point of a trap if you know where it is? How can you call something an "adventure" when you know about everything that is coming next? How hard is it to plan for future enemy encounters in a scenario when you can see through walls? Having an unfair advantage like this should appeal to people who are poor tacticians yet falsely believe themselves to be "tactical geniuses" and maybe [i]that[/i] is why people are raving about this game.

Thinking a game mechanic is "clever" has nothing to do with tactics and nothing about the laughable two card combat system is tactical let alone clever. Using the top and bottom portions of two cards in combat is a handicapping, nonsensical mechanic that stands as one of the worst combat systems I have ever seen implemented in a board game. There is no logical reason why running would prevent me from backstabbing someone on a later turn simply because it was on the same card that has already been used. All this does is add a worthless puzzle mechanic to combat.

While the attack modifier deck is just a lame excuse not to use dice with modifiers that is prone to abuse by failing to properly randomize it due to poor shuffling. So how many players have been given themselves an unfair advantage in Gloomhaven by failing to always [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI]riffle shuffle their attack modifier deck 7 times[/url]? How far have they unfairly advanced their characters this way? Why not just start over? Oh wait, they cannot since they applied all those stickers. Thanks "legacy" games!

Any remote relation to an RPG is further destroyed with your inability to equip any gear you acquire during a scenario or trade anything with another player. What an incredible advancement in game design! You can pick up a sword and carry it around but are unable to swing it at anything to do damage until after the scenario is over. This is clearly something everyone should be very excited to try out! These brilliant design decisions are what clearly makes this a perfect 10 all night long.

Ironically, players who "love" this game are likely cheating left and right by failing to follow the "appropriate communication" rule on page 17 of the rule book, "[i]Players should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about the initiative value or any other numerical value on any of their cards.[/i]" No wonder solo-gamers rave about this, since talking with yourself can never be considered cheating.

Regarding your heroes, the apparently guilty designers again shoehorn female characters into a game that mostly grown men are going to play but without any choice of gender selection in the sad hope that women are going to really play this dungeon crawl with them this time.

Then we have the character classes where most are not in the least bit original but merely synonyms of standard classes with race prefixes (Brute = Fighter, Scoundrel = Thief, Spellweaver = Mage etc...) Don't fear though, as you can later unlock exciting new classes like the "[url=http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven-spoilers]Human Sawbone[/url]" - I cannot make this stuff up. When you have to reach for stuff like this you need to stop trying.

Implementing the absolutely worst idea in the history of board gaming, Gloomhaven has people (owners of the game) talking about "leveling up" characters via solo play and then bringing them buffed up to their co-op sessions. Really? Who was the referee to make sure they either actually did what they said, did not cheat, took liberties with the rules or even just innocently played certain rules wrong? You mean to tell me if someone who just spent many hours leveling up a character on their own time gets that character killed and with no one around to see are not going to give themselves a "do-over"? Who is to stop someone from just declaring the characters are so without doing anything at all? Oh my friends you do not know human nature.

For over $100 and a box the size of a microwave oven you get to fight against a bunch of cardboard standees while you struggle to keep track of your hit points with a micro-wood counter that either constantly falls out of place or does not fit. Why wood? Because wood is retro man and should hold up well with the card board punch out character card or something. Don't worry though even if this is a crap system fanboys say you should just keep track of your HP in a way other than the game was designed because why pay over $100 for a well designed game?

Speaking of bad game design, when you get a big box you get everything BIG! Including the oversized '70s era plastic stands for the cardboard standees that obscure a third of the artwork and give the game an aura of dollar store quality. Again fanboys ridiculously dismiss that these are "easily replaceable." What part of you just paid over $100 for the game do they not understand? How come I never have to replace any of my Days of Wonder or Fantasy Flight Game components out of the box?

Continuing with flashback's to the '70's, the monster statistics are adjusted by rotating an over-sized square card and sliding it into what looks like a '70's era 8-inch floppy disk envelope. Not thinking this "idea" all the way through, as the monsters get more powerful they are rotated, so they wind up looking like they are either drunk or are hanging from the ceiling. Upside down artwork is clearly a sign of premier game design and not a beta version still in development.

But hey, you did get that BIG box right? Only a game like "Gloomhaven" can have a box so big yet be so poorly designed that you cannot fit everything back into it without taking a Japanese origami course. Yes that's right the fanboys are so embarrassed to admit it, that they simply leave piles of the game components on shelves and call it a win-win.

Lastly "Gloomhaven" takes you back to the '80s with pen and paper character sheets! Something I have been dreaming of ...actually no I have not.

Well, to be honest, I don't feel the hype at all. The gameplay-style seems to be exact the same as any dungeon crawler: you clear room by room, but the dice are replaced by a stat that you modify with a random card. 
The action selection mechanism of cards and cards that are permanent out of your deck if you use there stronger ability is nice, but it doesn't make me feel I'm playing something exciting, completely new. This feels like a 99,99% dungeon crawler like Arcadia Quest, Massive Darkness,...

We're playing Wouter's copy of the game, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm wondering how long the game can keep my interest: If the next scenario won't simply be more rooms with maybe some new type of monster we haven't seen before, but for the rest more of the same?

Minor remark: what also didn't help is that if you fail scenario 1, you have to completely replay it, while you know exact where which monster will be :s

this is a well designed and lovingly made game.  it is quite impressive.  the strategy/tactical choices are interesting and the legacy aspect is nice.  lots of luck in various phases of the game though.  

with four players and monsters at level 2, the game does require some decent skill.  items are really important as is not wasting the cards that go out of your hand.  however, the randomness of the monsters can be annoying if they block the only entrance way, causing people to waste turns.  while i like the attack modifier deck better than a d20, it is still quite random especially for enemies with shields.  might use the rule variant for reducing the swings.

Incredibly satisfying. It's not quite D&D-in-a-box like many people are advertising it as, atleast not RP-wise. Instead, it's a board game that heavily draws on mechanics invented within the medium, like Mage Knight and Legacy-style games. The combat system draws a lot on positioning and movement and gives this odd Euro style feel as a result - where it's important to plan your turns and always thinking how everything will fit into your limited resources. Lots of neat little details too that add more than I expected. Their is just barely enough RP choices to get you to think about your character and who they might be. The hidden goals are a great idea. The scenarios usually have a logical narrative progression and tend to branch a lot - giving a nice sense of exploration. So much stuff in this game should've just felt tacked on, and yet it works together beautifully.

Very good game. love to play it. scenario is well set up with nice storyline. Takes some time to set up though. Specially when you play it with different groups. 
Random events are also quite entertaining. The combat system with cards is nice and new. Although the combat modifier decks for me are a way to make the game somewhat more complex then needed. 
The cardboard monsters don't slide that easy in the standards, so they become damaged over time (even when careful). 
I also hate stickering games. I prefer just sheets to keep track. 
All in all a good solid DnD like game. No regrets I bought it,

Great legacy aspects and interesting classes.

Pros: very long campaign where previous choices affect the future, unlocking new characters, very tight and thinky game play mechanics, huge variety in monsters, Great enemy AI, Deep lore, bad luck can be mitigated by upgrading your decks through feats and leveling.  Road and city events are neat choose your path vignettes.

Cons: About 15 scenarios in - most feel similar (kill everything or something), sometimes the character you unlock isn't as fun as the one you just retired, and the mechanics can lead to min/maxing each turn.  Road and city events are crap shoots for which choice was the "better" one.

Components: Neat art on the standees and the tiles, although the tiles are often a little drab.  Lots and lots of tokens.  The cards are well laid out and contain a good amount of flavor text.  The minis (that I've seen) are high quality.  The tuck boxes aren't holding up amazing and the cards are on the thin side (not an issue for people who sleeve).

Overall, it's great and lives up to the hype.  It may not be everyone's favorite as it's not your typical fantasy tropes and has replaced dice chucking with hand management.

As someone who has tried, and failed to gather people for years to sit down and play DND in a group, i can really appropriate this game. A proper dungeon crawl that i can enjoy with 1+ players. The most appealing part of this system is that it does away with the DM that you would get in descent (i dont prefer the app because electronics)and DND like systems, while also giving you a rich, anything can happen game play. 

On of the most important feels that this game provides me is not only the character leveling and equipping, the amazing varied character selection legacy unlocked, but most importantly the unpredictable nature of the game, that isn't dictated by luck but more so by the sheer amount of content in the game

Cant wait to explore more.

I started paying attention to this game just after the first kickstarter ended. I was disappointed that I missed it. Luckily there was a second one. I was super excited for it and put my money down immediately. I watched tons of game play videos, read the rulebook, I couldn't get enough. I spend months hyping the game to my friends. When it finally arrived it did not disappoint. There is SO much content and it is a perfect combination of so many things I enjoy. A diverse RPG world with beautiful art and smooth, tactical gameplay. We have played almost twice a week since I got the game last month and I do not see us slowing down. It may not be for everyone, but for me (us) it is perfect.

I have been looking for a dungeon crawl for a long time, but suspect that I wouldn't enjoy the dice chucking involved in an awful lot of existing dungeon crawls. 
This one looks interesting. The designer has given some thought to the presentation of female characters (important to me) - though the ones he has decided on may not all be exactly as I would have hoped. 
The fighting is not done with dice - and looks like it would be an interesting puzzle to solve. 
And then there is an element of exploration (plus the whole legacy thing) which looks like something I would enjoy. Very curious about this one!
--
After 1.5 games in a random scenario I am now five games into my solo three-character campaign. Absolutely love it. It does take a bit of time to set up, tear down, and somehow attempt to fit into the box again. And so far I don't think I have spent less than two hours on a scenario (minus set up and tear down). But it is a great experience. Overlooked some rules, but so far mostly things that have made it less good for the characters (the coin that slain monsters drop), so not too bad. Have already leveled up two characters, and two characters have started working on completing their personal goal - the third has not had a chance to do that yet.
Great, great experience!
I guess the score for the game will have to come down - I love playing it and I think a lot about it when I'm not playing it. But it is so big in most meanings of that word that I rarely manage to actually get the game to the table - recently I've never gotten further than dragging out the box, finding the party sheet and the scenario book to try and figure out where to go next, and then decide it's too much hassle and pack it all away again. When I do have the energy though, it's a lot of fun.

Initial rating after one incomplete random scenario with 3 players:
Difficult to judge the legacy aspect after one play, so I will return to this once I get a chance to play some scenarios in the campaign.

It is not the second coming... but it was a pleasent experience. 

Positive:
Interesting hand management
Not much rule overhead, clean design
Brings right amount of challenge, there is a good amount of tension in the game
Decent amount of decisions (not only where to move or what to attack)
Coop feeling - players must collaborate to succeed, but there is also posibility of the negative interaction (loot, be selfish)
Encourages communication between players without alpha player syndrom

Negative:
long setup, but there is room for improvement with good organization of tokens and cards
Some fiddleness, but related to tokens and cards moving around the board, not the rules overhead.
AP prone, but could be improved if players know the game better and their hero decks better.

I've decided to preorder  and will comeback to Gloomhaven once my copy arrives.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Controlling the enemies is a nightmare, but I like the core mechanics.

I would've happily traded away the ability to scale each scenario to reduce the unbearable fiddliness of every single enemy turn.

Each enemy attack, you have to look in three places for the value.  His AI card, his stat card and then the modifier card.

The scenario (11 or 12) where you have allies was a grueling experience... if we had failed, I'd have called it quits on the whole thing.  As it is, we have not gone back.

This has rather quickly become one of my favorite games - the tactical combat is always challenging, and the campaign is equal parts full of wonder and danger, I watch my friends achieve their dreams and goals as my own character nears retirement, and the fate of the world is handed down to a new generation of heroes with newly-unlocked character classes and new game mechanics. The only thing keeping me from giving Gloomhaven a 10 is the excessive amount of admin - setting everything up is a pain in the ass sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
There are definitely flaws to this game. That's why it isn't a 10. The strange thing is that it's just as fun, maybe even more fun to me than Arkham Horror LCG, which I rated a 10. But it's also about as fun as Imperial Assault, which I rated a 9. They're all tremendously fun games.

The problems first. The biggest problem to the game is setup. It takes a long time. Its not just prior to the game, it's also during the game as you reveal rooms. It takes a long time. In IA, you need to find guys and set them up, but with Gloomhaven there is also the monster decks and the monster card that you need to find among a billion other cards. That's the worst part. And I really dislike the idea of using an app to track it. It's just not as fun to do that. 

It's probably related to the first problem, but for what it is, it takes a long time to play. Both IA and Arkham Horror the card game can definitely be played in under 2 hours per scenario. Gloomhaven feels so slow compared to the other games. It often takes more than 3 hours to complete a scenario for 4 people. That's rough.

Scenario design is also pretty straightforward. There are some cool mechanics with the bosses and all that, and that changes, but the actual map is static. The goals are generally the same. In IA the goals change, but there aren't the cool different mechanics. In Arkham Horror LCG, there are cool boss mechanics AND the actual scenario map will shift and change AND other different things can happen. So the scenario design is pretty meh compared to AHLCG but decent compared to everything else. So this isn't a huge negative, but it isn't a huge positive either. 

Okay the positives. The cardplay is pretty fun. It's definitely not the most fun part of the game. I like eurogames, but I like Ameritrash better. So yes its fun and different. It's thinky, but it's not the standout part of the game for me. But it's definitely fun. Its fun figuring out the initiative and the positioning and how to manage the cards. That definitely adds to the game. 

The game is huge. That's the biggest part that I like and that I keep coming back to. In IA, there aren't 17 different characters to unlock. There are all these different perks to add to your character. I want to find all these items and see if they're any good. I want to figure out what's going on in Gloomhaven. I want to get some global achievements. That aspect of the game is the standout part of it. 95 scenarios! That's crazy. This is what makes me think about the game more and more. I actually don't really like playing my character, the Tinkerer. But because I don't like playing him that much, I want to complete his personal quest and unlock a new character. It also feels great to add cards to the attack modifier deck. That part is cool.

I just started the first scenario and i was just blown away with the game play and mechanics.  Since I have been watching videos ever since this came out, I kinda already knew how the game plays so it was easy the first time around and what so far what an experience.  There's so much in this box.  Arguably one of the best games I played and best game of the year for 2017.

I had fun, and I would definitely play it again. That said, I think Shadows of Brimstone is a better "dungeon crawler" and the fact that one combat encounter took 90 minutes to complete in Gloomhaven dropped this game down a few points in my book. Yes, seriously - 90 minutes for one combat. Brimstone seems more efficient, as much as I like many things about Gloomhaven.

When a game is not fun to play, it's not a good game. It's slow, the RPG vibe is lost with euro mechanics. It's slow. There are so many dungeon crawlers that work better than this one... I can't understand the hype, but we'll see in a few months, I expect a lot of them in ebay.

:edit: After receiving the full version of this game I can now see what a labor of love this game was. The pure scope and depth of this game is mind blowing. So glad to own something like this that is not based off of dice. An endless amount of DIFFERENT baddies to fight, locations to discover, items to buy and characters to meet. Sort of shocked that Isaac actually pulled this off. I can feel the immense amount of work that went into this game and for that I have changed my rating to reflect my view on the full version. Thank you Isaac for this game. Well done.

----

I have only gotten to play the first scenario provided on Tabletop Simulator but I have to say I am sold on this system. It does so many things right its hard to list them all here. Removing the dice and making combat and movement card driven is perfect. Trying to figure out the combat initiative and which card you need to play first in order to pull off a great combo is just so satisfying. 

Each character feels like they have something important to contribute and when Im looking at my hand of cards there really isnt any "throw aways" you are just really excited to try and figure out what to use when.

I also enjoy the elemental system and it doesnt feel tacked on it actually has some really nice in game consequences. The last thing I will say is the game is REALLY easy to manage and never gets in its own way with rule exceptions and a million little questions you need to look up this is a HUGE plus. The game plays smooth and lets you enjoy it without bogging you down.

Im leaving out a lot of things here that I love like the battle cards, the hidden character objectives, the leveling system, the monster ai, and the card management with discarding vs lost cards but these are all great innovative mechanics that really give a fresh take on the "dungeon crawl" style game. 

I look forward to seeing how the campaign plays out but I can only imagine that will make the game even better.

This game is quite simply stunning in size and scope.  My initial 9.5 rating takes 0.5 point off for minor complaints such as setup time, large footprint, and the amount of card shuffling involved.  

I can easily overcome minor complaints to enjoy a truly amazing product.  This game has more content than several other games combined.  

The action modification deck is a great game mechanism that adds uncertainty and randomness without feeling like things are out of your control.  

The initiative system for determining who performs actions first is unique and works well.  Monsters also have initiative values on their action cards.  

This game would be something special if it included a fraction of it's content and didn't have a legacy style campaign system.  The reality is the game is huge and the legacy mechanics are well implemented and don't distract from the overall gameplay.  

This game really sets the bar high for quality,ingenuity,and entertainment.  Do yourself a favor and find a way to play this game soon.  You won't regret it.  

Edit: Raised the rating to 10.  There's no reason in my mind this game doesn't deserve such recognition.  Really impressed.

This game is a solid ten. It is the [i]only[/i] ten in my collection. It is [i]that[/i] good. The base of the game is it's tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren't destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn't have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It's worth every penny.

Only a few plays in, but this might very well end up among my favourite games! Reminds me of Mage Knight on a smaller scale with a cool story on top.

After 6 plays, this game continues to astound me! I love the interesting decisions, the team play and the back stabiness of the game! I do wish that each scenario was slightly shorter.

After 10 plays, this gem continues to fire on all cylindres! My favourite game of all time!

15 plays later and the game still has me excited! Despite retiring to a character I'm not convinced I quite like as much as the Scoundrel, I still look forward to returning to the game.

27 scenarios later: Just retired my second character, which I grew to love. I just opened a new character with some very interesting mechanics. I hope I get to play around with them for a little bit. However, while I still absolutely love the game and still consider it among my favourites, I need a break. I've probably had too much Gloomhaven. I will want to return to the city of Gloomhaven, though!

I can tell this is better than most other dungeon crawler/campaign games. The way you manage your deck and play cards is a fantastic supstitute for dice. The story/missions show a lot of work into making this a big cohesive world. Really, there are only two reasons I rank this game lower: the rulebook is hard to reference and I believe there is too much dead time early in the campaign trying to earn those first few upgrades. Some level 1 heroes just aren't very good. Quite a time commitment playing the game long enough for things to get really interesting.

Update:
I've spent enough time with the game to appreciate the finer details. Classes that were originally under-powered are revealing their depth. Adjusting your deck each mission is a tricky, but oh so rewarding when you get it right. Some of the mission designs are straight up brilliant. Can't wait to unlock even more stuff!

I'm going to need to play this game more to make a full decision.  So far, I think it's good, but definitely not as good as the hype.  It has completely replaced Descent, for us though.

The first scenario seemed brutally hard for my wife and I.  We are definitely going to be playing on easy.  If I'm going to be committing 2 hours to setup, play, and tear down a game, I don't want to feel bruised when I'm done.

So far my only real complaint is that some of the components are pretty lame.  The cards, specifically...they just feel cheap.  Having said that, you get a [b]ton[/b] for your money here.  I don't get hung up too much on components or theme.  This was just one thing that stood out to me as a bit of a surprise (the cheap cards).

I love legacy games and I also love dungeon crawlers...
And the idea of a dungeon crawler legacy makes me happy!

I'm in this game also due to the combat system, which I find really strategic and fresh. Let's see how it plays.

Played once but not been able to finish the game due to time, bad business X( ... However, the first impressions of this game are incredibly good ones.  Just waiting to retry and go on in more scenarios.

UPDATE (50 hours in): 
The more I play the more I want to play. This is simply the most fun I've had playing a game.  I don't normally give out 10s for games but this isn't a normal game. The scope, detail, variability, and persistence are groundbreaking. If something changes with more hours logged I'll update again.

ORIGINAL Review (10 hours in) (9.5):
I'm thrilled to play Gloomhaven. I'm only just beginning to work through the campaign, but already I'm hooked. I don't see another game overtaking this as my top game for quite some time.

Size: this game is massive, not just physically (largest box I own by a large margin), but in scope as well. It has the largest campaign I have seen in a game of this style while also including a random dungeon generator.

Mechanics: Finally an RPG/Dungeon Crawl style game that uses Euro style play. Hand management, deck building, etc.

Theme: The setting and artwork are simply stunning. It's immersive and beautiful. My son hasn't stopped poring over the pictures since it came in.

Value: Gloomhaven provides more value/$ than any game I've seen in print.

Correct game with some issues. It feels more as a puzzle than an adventure/dungeoncrawler game to me. I feel the combat too abstract and repetitive. The storytelling/campaign mode is quite simple, despite the sandbox possibilities are quite impressive. Scenarios design as, as far as I've played (8 scenarios so far), quite poor. Almost everything is about killing enemies. Long set up. By the other hand, plays are interesting from a tactical perspective, and once you're in the heat of the moment it's fun. But I think that in a game with all those possibilities of storytelling, campaign, adventuring, character development, etc, it's a shame that none of them really shines. It's an admirable game, though. There are a lot of hours put on it.

RATING: 8.6
K/S copy with minis.
To start with , it can feel a bit marmite and adjusting the difficulty to the party play style can take a few missions. In a our introductory games, as a Brute, the game seemed to be straight forward and our party of 3 worked well together. I like the way it's possible to tweak the difficulty to various tastes.

Starting our 4 player campaign, proved difficult, especially as players concerntrated on achieveing personal objectives over group cohesion on a more difficult setting.  Which made for some fun role playing and led to our first run of failed missions.

This feels like D&D in a box.

(10/01/2015) - Backed on Kickstarter at the level that includes miniatures. Estimated release of May 2016.

(02/01/2017) - What a monster of a game, Gloomhaven is here!

(04/09/2017) - [10] - An absolute masterpiece of game design. A sublime blend of D&D-style roleplaying, RPG character development, with rewarding tactical gameplay. The city and road encounters add a great source of tension as you wonder what your choices will result in for rewards or punishments. Absolutely cannot wait to play more of this.

The distilled essence of a video game, in tabletop form. All the fun trappings of a legacy game, plus a solid tactical battle puzzler engine to keep you engaged while you slowly unlock items. The 2nd edition makes some smart balance changes - the shorter prosperity track in particular helps the shop stay relevant earlier in the campaign.

RATING: N/A
So the game was WAY delayed. I realize it was out of Isaacs (game creators) control (and not really delayed at all compared to many kick starters) but he did market the second print by saying that he'd learned a lot from the first and that this one wasn't gonna be late like that. Then it was.

So far all good. Shit happens rama rama ding dong.

Then the copies started arriving and the issues with gluing and cutting tokens became known. Again, not directly on Isaac but he's ultimately responsible. 

But hey, they've promised to replace everything and anything. So we're still good.

I still hadn't received my copy and I find out that he is selling 300 copies at Essen!?!!?

This is where my gears start to grind. Some random geek who didn't back the game on either of the two kickstarters has hers or his copy before me (and basically every backer in the US)?

Yeah, no. Not cool. Either use them for replacement parts or send them to backers.

Basically, I've learned not to kickstart games. My patience just isn't up for it. And I've learned I can just go to Essen and pick the games up anyway.

The game is a beast so far though. I can actually see myself completing the whole campaign...

RATING: 7
I am averse to rating Gloomhaven too high, and still I feel my rating here is *very* generous. If I were to evaluate its mechanisms and concepts in a vacuum, it should in truth yield a much lower rating for me here. None of the mechanisms are particularly original or thought-provoking. Ratings are subjective, of course, and so for context, my ratings generally describe how much I enjoy playing a game, and factor in how much it vexes or enthralls me and gets the cogs truly whirring in my brain. After numerous plays, I began to compare Gloomhaven to the games which I have rated an "8" or above. My plays have yet to evoke the same sense of character that I feel from those games. Gloomhaven does not offer the same emergent gameplay depth from simple mechanisms. It does not beguile me or make me feel clever for exploiting pre-defined constraints. I do not finish scenarios of Gloomhaven and have them pervade my mind days or weeks later. A "7" seems fitting, at least for now. Each play is a fun diversion, with a fault that is easy to forget amidst the chrome and the content.

Gloomhaven falls victim to the folly of most, if not all, cooperative games: It is merely an exercise in no-fallout puzzle solving. At worst, you fail, but in truth you merely lost to some inanimate game automa, and this same concept taints each victory with a light pang of hollowness: "Congrats, you have successfully exploited the intended loopholes in the automa." In fact, the most ardent devotees of Gloomhaven on these very forums stress time and again that this is the optimal way to play: exploit the outlined mechanisms of the game to eke out little advantages here and there, even if they are unthematic to a scenario, for the game was presumably designed to be so treated. 

"Oh, hey, if you position yourself down this corridor, that monster has no way to get to you except walking through three sets of traps. Good thing it will do JUST that!"

To reiterate, this is not necessarily unique to Gloomhaven, but to nearly all cooperative games. Gloomhaven just possesses so many exceptions and exploitative mechanisms that they are the forefront of the game. It pains me to see it often compared to DnD. The latter has a wealth of soul which Gloomhaven could only dream of possessing. DnD monsters do not have a one-track mind, as they are operated by a living, breathing, calculating and cunning person. Gloomhaven facetiously parades itself as a dungeon crawler, when in truth it is a predictive stream of cooperative euro-puzzles masked with a dungeon-crawling skin.

HOWEVER (and this is a significant clause), having said all that, I do feel that this title deserves all of the accolades it has received, if only to acknowledge the marvel of board game design that Isaac Childres has achieved. If you've followed his design blog at all, or played a game with him in person, you will find that Isaac is an astoundingly meticulous, calculating, and methodical fellow, and his gaming philosophy oozes from every single crack and crevice in the world of Gloomhaven. I have no doubt it took near unfathomable hours of dedication to balance the interactions between players and monsters, to consider all aspects and exceptions of this automa that he has designed, and to offer such a wealth of content at an almost unrivaled value (do NOT feed the scalpers, the experience worth 100-150 bones at most). 

And so, for that, I consider Mr. Childres certainly a budding designer of note, and I believe he has created a game that is worthy of its excited following. My hope is that as Isaac explores further designs--that he branches off from the fiddly (oh, how I hate that word, but alas) nature of Forge War, Gloomhaven, and upcoming Founders--My hope is that he is one day able to do *more with LESS*. If Isaac were to give us a showstopper in elegant design, I can see him surely cementing his place amongst the echelon of renowed designers. 

(+) Provides a challenging decision space that requires careful consideration of all of your options, forcing you to weigh the value of opportunism versus safe play. 
(+) The balance in this game seems to have been carefully crafted. In no way have I felt like a scenario was completely unwinnable or unfair. In no way have I felt like I bit off more than I can chew when delving into unrelated side scenarios.
(+) There is an absolute abundance of content. You WILL get what you pay for.

(-) The core mechanisms of this game are fairly uninspired.
(-) The game's depth is not emergent. It finds replay value not in depth of mechanisms, but in its vast amount of content that you have to digest as you work through the campaign. Oh, and my goodness is the setup an absolute bear.
(-) It is a cooperative game. Thus, there is no real competition. There are no true battles of wits. You are merely exploiting the pre-defined automa to puzzle through one scenario after another.

I was a skeptic when this first came out. Now that I have played it. Wow!What a great game. Descent 1.0 is far superior. With that said, Gloomhaven's combat system destroys Descent's. This is by far my favorite combat system in a dungeon crawl. No dice = less luck and more strategy. As of this writing, we have played (4 of us)about 20 scenarios give or take 1 or 2. The game is punishingly hard and agonizing right down to the end of each scenario. We start each scenario thinking there is no way...then lo and behold on our death beds we manage to pull out victories. We have already uncovered a few secrets and still have quite a few more to go. Compelling story and very engaging gameplay. Highly recommended to the people on the fence about giving it a go.

So far the best Co-op dungeon crawl game I've played. Just enough randomness to have those special moments but not so much that you feel the combat decks are determining the outcome. Tactical decisions matter. There is always a sense that if you make one bad decisions you could lose. It's that tension that makes it a great game. Of course, the campaign, loot, character progression and exploration help it along also.

RATING: 6
The legacy elements seem neat, but the gameplay did not sit well with me.  I liked the decisions surrounding picking your cards for the turn, but those decisions were diluted by bookkeeping the monsters.

A huge amount of time was spent bookkeeping and tracking lots of enemies and computing their AI and figuring out how much health each had.  Better info representation would help a lot (like using dice on the board instead of two levels of indirection to obfuscate one of the most important pieces of data.

note:  I played 4 player in a scenario with a lot of creatures (the tavern brawl).  Maybe the game is much better with other scenarios, but that scenario was a kickstarter demo scenario so I expected it to show of the game's strengths not its weaknesses.

update:  playing a real scenario instead of the terrible, terrible, terrible tavern scenario raised this from 4/10 to 6/10.  It's neat and interestingly tactical.  I find I get bored of a character playing it over and over, but if I can switch between characters after every few scenarios then it holds its interest.

The majority of game play, which is the tactical combat part is fun and exciting but nothing really revolutionary.  It reminds me a bit of mage knight. You select the actions you want to perform each turn but your choices gets more limited as time goes on.  The choices for the legacy part of the game seems arbitrary and not story driven.  You are asked to make random decisions on encounters and you get random results.  Also some of the components are little questionable, especially the health and XP markers.   The way you mark the damages is also incredibly fiddly, there has to be a better way than just putting a bunch of small chits in a tiny area. The game sounds great but the actual experience is average.  It's a good game but not sure if it lives up to all the hype.

RATING: 7.4
starts out really slow for a group of beginners. the tactical dungeon crawling is pretty fun, but after a while begins to feel a little like Pandemic. it's like you're going through your deck and eventually you'll hit a moment you have to rest, even if you're not 100% ready. still, you can predict it just like watching the deck in Pandemic thin out expecting an Epidemic. but is a Rest really comparable to an Epidemic? depends on the group's situation, but often you're either stranded far away, hurting for a heal, or stranded by monsters. sometimes all three at once. it's not the end of the world, but the group is going to have to work around this and hope it doesn't lead to some sort of cascade or outbreak of negative consequences. this tension is pretty sweet, but it never translated to character growth to me. the group pulled through, not me. upgrades are often incremental or specific to a situation i don't know if i can plan to expect. whatever, these are going to feel like poor arguments to the crowd who are still drooling over this game. if you like what you've seen elsewhere then by all means get it. it has bits which will appeal to both co-op gamers and dungeon crawl veterans alike. i just want to stress that this is a hybrid game and may feel weak in some areas. but, i definitely hope you get a chance to play someone else's copy for a bit! oh, and if you were wondering, the legacy bit feels like it only adds to the game experience. i believe you WILL get your money's worth if you play this to the end.

Heaviest box of game ever.

RATING: 7
Pros:
• An RPG that emphasizes skill and planning, and deemphasizes random chance, to determine the outcome of dungeon conflict. There is a deck building mechanism of sorts that involves choosing cards from a pool of cards that increases as your character levels up. The card choices need to address each scenario's challenges. 
• Strategies evolve as player experience with the game grows. 
• Variety of unique character class choices and innovative NPC AI make each scenario a new puzzle.
• Interesting story (not great but interesting) and world. Legacy/campaign aspect of the game is done well. Art throughout is outstanding, and the writing is well done.
• The branching campaign story keeps interest and engagement high. Enjoyment of the game grows with each playing as your skill increases, and as new story branches are revealed. 

Cons: 
• There is a lot of clerical overhead to this game that detracts from the experience. I would rate the game a point or more higher if not for this drawback. It's necessary to record the progress of individual characters, Gloomhaven, and the world as a whole. If you aren't careful about recording the details, it affects the overall quality of the campaign experience. This task becomes quite tedious and tiresome after a couple of dozen plays, and after a couple of dozen more you begin to question if it's all worth it. In addition, remembering the elements of the story and how the scenarios are related from one game night to the next is a challenge that I could have done without. You often have to review the previous scenarios to refresh your memory about where your party is in their story.
• The game can be frustratingly difficult at first. Replaying the same scenario multiple times to crack the cypher is sometimes necessary. If you don't like cogitating on a puzzle, then Gloomhaven is probably not for you. Scenario difficulty is heavily dependent on the character class makeup of the party. 
• Learning curve can be steep. If you have a lot of board gaming experience then you shouldn't have much trouble picking up the rules but this is not a game for someone that is unfamiliar with board game mechanics. The game is rated as a 4 on a 5 pt scale  for weight/complexity, and that seems accurate to me. Of course, it's this complexity that also makes the game so interesting. 
• The game is huge. Organization of game components and storage are issues that take a good deal of thought. Without a good organizational storage solution, setting up the game is an obstacle. I removed the provided insert - it wasn't helpful and prevented everything from fitting easily back into the original box once the map tiles are punched. Instead, I use three GMT counter trays, and a Plano box. The map tiles fill the bottom of the box, and everything is stored on top. This keeps everything in the one box, and allows for a logical setup/breakdown process. Unfortunately, setup/breakdown still takes a lot of time. 
• I wish the cards were a higher quality card stock but there are so many of them I understand why they are not.
• The plastic standee bases are just office supply clips in the 1st edition but I understand they are improved in the 2nd printing. I replaced them with clear plastic bases from Fantasy Flight, then I painted a few with gold metallic for the elite monsters.

RATING: N/A
Based on all the reviews I have watched, I rate it a 5 as a game that looks like it would be amazing for the right person but horrible for me. This is a game where I think it's ok to rate without playing because playing and consuming this game knowing I won't like it is just wasting my or my friend's money and time, so I preemptively rate it to avoid this, and to suggest that others research and make sure they're going to love it before trying it (and if you're reading this it means you've probably already done that research and know for yourself). If you live Mage Knight, this looks like the perfect next step.

This game is fantastic. It does so many things right in terms of coop, dungeon crawling, balancing, and tension that it's hard to know where to begin. The elemental system feels incredibly clunky and easy to forget, and I kind of wish it was removable, or changed in the second edition. But everything else is amazing. Highly recommended.

This game is absolutely outstanding. It has great coop mechanics where your party has to work together but has to do so without giving too much away each turn, and a fun story line that will either punish or reward you depending on your choices (that you can't go back on). 

The game has an insane amount of pieces (granted I love this part of it), which is made way better and smoother operation with proper organization of it all. 

I honestly want to play it all the time.

Best adventure game, dungeon-crawl, "rpg", whatever you want to call it, hands down.  Most accurate description I've heard for it was "Skyrim in a box."  I would agree with that, but I'd argue that it has better combat.
The game has great lore, components, gameplay, player interaction, value, rulebook, design, footprint, and everything.  It really is a game like no other.  Only con would be if you dropped the box on your foot because it weighs in at 22 lbs.  Can't recommend this game enough.

I had the TTS version of this from the kickstarter.  Just didnt feel like this game was anygood.  Strategy was to save cards by rushing to the boss and killing as little as possible while trying to get gold and avoid traps.  There is no repercussion for loosing, you just do it again and grind out XP.  The writing was just mediocre generic fantasy.  I dont understand what the big deal was? Kingdom Death: Monster is way better.

Isaac has built the next evolution of RPG boardgaming.  Only a couple of scenarios in but the last time I was this engaged was during heavy D&D campaigns some years back.  The game is so well balanced, the characters are played best to their classes.  The story is engaging.  The legacy aspect means you feel you're in a constantly changing world and that your decisions matter.  Random modifiers on top of card driven strategy means you're not at the mercy of luck all the time.  There are a fair number of boardgames that try to do this that I will never get to the table again.  This is what I will look for in RPG boardgames games from 2017.

Lots to love about this fairly unique and enormously ambitious Kickstarter-spawned monstrosity. The world - particularly the races and character types - is original and intriguing, and gameplay (ie combat) is engrossing. Building up decks (or character progression) is also well-designed - but as for the campaign play and unlocking of features itself: it’s a brutal slog, frankly. The quality of writing in the encounters is sub-par, and the actual choices are uninteresting. The scenario book spoils the element of surprise that would put this more into the dungeoncrawl than tactical miniatures combat category, which is a bit disappointing. And the map is silly - “legacy” is fine, but why print it on a game board instead of just card stock or paper? The lack of “real” travelling is a let down. This game only exists because of Kickstarter - it is inconceivable that it would emerge from development from a real publisher in anything like this format - all those terrain boards that are mostly similar anyway - why?

But, frankly, it’s a masterpiece. The flaws are irrelevant if a game is fun, and for all the hype around this one, people aren’t playing it unless they are enjoying it. A glorious mess, that will hopefully inspire other designers to tackle this he challenge of creating an epic GM-less fantasy campaign board game. For now this is an admirable try.

Was surprisingly good. Actually won the first scenario on the very last round with the last cards in a 3-P game. Pretty tense and tonnes of tough decisions.

seems to get better with the second play, as it became easier to figure out what each character can do in-game. 

not sure if the spellweaver is a great character, but i think she (he? it?)'s been awesome.

Seven games in and the lustre is beginning to wear off as the game has revealed itself to be a grind rather than an adventure.  There is a distinct lack of memorable moments and no puzzle solving as each scenario so far has resolved as room/fight/door/room/fight/door/room/fight etc. until the party wins or runs away in defeat.  The story being played out feels to be of little consequence as the game simply sets up yet another horde to hack and slash through.

The gameplay drags too, that moment when I see how little distance has been covered on the maps due to the laborious bookkeeping and calculations for the monsters is a disappointment, and only enhances the feeling of the grind.

Gloomhaven is an incredibly ambitious game, and a bit of a beast. It's a legacy RPG dungeon crawl, but it distinguishes itself from other similar campaign or one-off skirmish games with the sheer quantity of content (it has 95 distinct scenarios and roughly 1,700 cards), card driven mechanics, sense of progression, and story elements.

I tend to dislike most combat dice resolution systems, and I much prefer the combat deck system in Gloomhaven. It allows more gradual changes to combat ability, and I like the probability distribution better. The hand management is also an interesting constraint, and serves to drive a lot of the tension in combat.

Gloomhaven is a commitment, but it's a good chunk of what I wanted out of RPGs like D&D and more than I expected out of a campaign dungeon crawl.

On the other hand, there are a few areas where I see room for improvement. While the game comes with an incredible amount of content, particularly for it's price point, the component quality is not the best. It's serviceable, particularly if you sleeve the cards, but many similar games have higher quality components. Probably a fourth or less of the actual content, but nicer components. The box really doesn't come with a good method of storing the components, so you'll need to figure out a storage solution.

In addition, I wish that there were fewer places I had to look to resolve a monster turn. You need to look at the monster action card and compare that against the attack modifier and the monster ability card every time they attack, and if that could have been streamlined down to 2 places to look I feel like the combat would flow more smoothly.

It's also a long game; a scenario can easily clock in at 2+ hours, and a campaign is ~60 scenarios. In some ways I wish that the combat was faster paced, and more emphasis was placed on the encounter cards and choices outside of combat. I really enjoy the road and city events, and I'd like to see that idea fleshed out more. Sometimes the combat goals don't line up with your character's long term goals or play style, and I would have liked it more if the battle goals were tied into the character's career goals more or at least given more thematic justification.

There are some other aspects of Gloomhaven that are poorly implemented. The class balance could use some work, many class cards are unnecessarily awkward to use, summons are awkward and often useless, it feels like you should be able to move more freely if you don't do any other actions, and the action economy for some of the long term effects and looting creates awkward situations and tempo problems for certain classes.

Still, Gloomhaven is a big step in the right direction, and there is a lot of fun to be had with it.

Jan 2018 -- After 6 plays: WOW. This game is what I always wanted. An abolutely spectacular playing game that is a joy to own and experience. I can see the next year of my gaming being filled with tales of Gloomhaven.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
After the first scenario, I'm a little disappointed. The cards mechanics won't click with me and since the combat cards don't feature any artwork it isn't that immersive. Scenario briefing has lots of text but no illustrations either. As far as the game mechanics go I rather prefer something less puzzle-y and more storytelling, to be honest. Rating (5) might go up during our campaign.

Update: After our second scenario I'm still on the fence. The puzzle-y aspect won't change as far as I can see. I really hope level 2 will make this more enjoyable. Starting with Cragheart was the wrong choice since it doesn't have an obvious play style (not really a tank, not really a support, can only be played as a ranged damage dealer). Slightly adjusting the rating from 5 up to 6.

Update: I had to swap my character because Cragheart wasn't fun at all. Switched to the Tinkerer which seems to be more versatile to play and has some synergy effects with the Spellweaver. We're all level 2+ now, but the power spike other reviewers have promised didn't occur (at least not for me). The story is kind of meh, the hidden per player battle goals are cool, though. Some scenarios seem way too long with 4 players. I guess you get much more fun out of this playing only with 2 players. With 4 this starts to feel like an endless grind and it basically boils down to micromanaging everyone's turn.

Let's look at the cons & pros so far and also compare this to another current dungeon crawler Imperial Assault...

Cons:
- loot isn't shared, which can result in some awkward dynamics in the group if players are primarily concentrating on looting
- so far the scenario objectives have been pretty much the same: kill all enemies
- leveling up is slow (!!!) and not as rewarding as in IA
- most of the story characters don't pop up in the scenario, it feels like you just fight random waves of enemies instead
- since there is no dungeon master, one of the players has to check the scenario briefing all the time, so that person will inevitably know all the information upfront, if the solo scenarios aren't structured differently I don't see how anyone can play this solo
- with everyone owning their separate gold and experience pool the co-op nature of this game takes a hit. since leveling up is slow, everyone is trying to get the upper hand on gold/XP and therefore is less focused on the group itself (your mileage may vary)
- scenario maps so far are pretty standard rectangular rooms with only a few obstacles, if you are searching for iconic or memorable places, you will be disappointed
- since you practically always have line of sight, placement for ranged characters doesn't matter as much, which makes strategizing obsolete and just staying your distance is the default
- there seems to be a balancing issue in how quickly each character can level up, there's quite a gap between characters after the 3rd session
- most of the items you can acquire are one-time use only, so the new shiny thing you just bought is good for a single action during your 3h session
- as mentioned in the initial remark, action cards lack immersive artwork, if I have a f-ing flamethrower I wanna see a f-ing flamethrower! I can't remember a single action card title of my new character
- personal quests are merely stretched out battle goals and not specific to a character, there's not much story since the whole narrative fits on a standard card, this is the thing that disappoints me the most and it turns into pure grind quickly - in IA you get a tailored side mission and a unique reward for each character 
- the standees seem to be not overly well made, one artwork peeled off right out of the box. the plastic stands look ugly and cheap, the punched tokens are also pretty much off (this is a minor issue for me)
- artwork and naming is pretty generic fantasy 101 (except the character depictions), the tiles look rather dull and most of the smaller enemies so far are hard to differentiate, some colors are overused throughout the game too, artwork isn't ugly but also not very pretty

Pros:
- the world map is pretty cool and putting the stickers on is exciting as the world reveals its places. Although you only get to see it 5 minutes of a 3h session and the font is only readable up close. It's a nice alternative to a campaign log nevertheless

Neutral:
- not sure if I like the initiative mechanic or not, for most of the time you gonna try to match a fast initiative card with a slow one and only go slow the last rounds before resting anyway. This does become the default quickly (I do like the IA turn structure much better, but since there is no DM here this is neither a con nor a pro)
- you can't move through enemies, doors are easily blocked which gets frustrating in a crowded 4 player game (this is a con for me, but you be the judge)

After our 3rd and 4th scenario, this is still a 6. I'm nevertheless curious what there might be coming. But if this does become a grind with little reward, the rating might go down again. I'm still missing an overall plot here, or maybe there is one and I'm just forgetting all of it after 3 hours of puzzle combat. With that said, Gloomhaven is currently no longer on my wishlist.

Final verdict: After our 5th session we played another game back to back and instantly realized how much more fun this is than grinding dungeon after dungeon. Owner is selling Gloomhaven after another try in a different group. I wouldn’t play this again, if it wasn’t for a friend.

I'm four scenarios in and it's basically all I can think about. 

This game is easily the best dungeon crawler of all time. I want to adapt its combat system to my D&D campaign. GH does lose 0.5 points for having a fairly annoying setup. Practice and thoughtful categorizing of components will help a great deal. Time will tell if I will dock off a full point or not.

Gloomhaven is fairly solid game that does a lot right, but still leaves much to be desired for me. I really enjoy the scope of the game: the world building, the choices, and the multiple paths. Unfortunately, the story telling doesn't really come though in the gameplay, which can be a bit of a slog.

Every scenario feels very same-y. Open a door. Some of the monsters will be elite, some won't be. They'll be a treasure chest in one of the rooms. Kill all the monsters, win the scenario.

I know that a lot of people really enjoyed the card combat and the modifier decks. I just kept feeling that I just really wanted to roll some dice, but I know that that's just personal preference. The combat just doesn't feel very exciting to me.

My wife and I played through the Arcadia Quest campaign a few months ago, and I keep feeling like Arcadia Quest has a lot of the same elements as Gloomhaven, but it's a lot more fun. Every time I play Gloomhaven, I kind of just feel like I'd rather be playing Arcadia Quest.

Gloomhaven is a solid game that a lot of people really enjoy, but it's one that I only want to play occasionally.

RATING: 10
A perfect rating is something I almost never feel waranted in giving out, however rare exceptions can happen in extreme cases, and this happens to be one. Isaac has created something quite remarkable with what I'm sure will be long remembered as his Magnum Opus in game design. A tactical and strategic Euro game masquerading as a traditionally Ameritrash fantasy style battle romp. And he accomplished both goals in spades. I can't really stress that final point enough.
My game preference is mostly focused on Euro strategy, but I do have gamer friends that are largely if not solely interested in Ameritrash. To find a game that so brilliantly appeals to both camps, with such an enormous amount of content and replay ability, is almost unheard of (at least to this date).

Thank you Isaac for this rare and incredible gift to the community...
You deserve all the praise and accolades you are already receiving and I'm sure will continue to as more and more get exposed to this amazing creation. Hats off...

Updated... Many reviewers have been calling this early as the 'game of the year'.
That description doesn't really do it justice though. I however am now ready to give this the more inevitably accurate descriptor, 'Game of the Decade!'

That's right... You heard me... I'm calling it right now, with confidence :)

RATING: 7
This game is rough around the edges and has punishing unrealistic difficulty (we never attempted a mission at anything but "easy"). But the worst part about it is if you fail a mission, nothing changes (except you get some XP, which can actually make the monsters stronger since they are leveled to you - a bad concept wherever it appears) and you must just replay the exact same scenario over again with the same setup, which is not fun.

Otherwise, however, the mechanics of card playing are very interesting, and unlocking things is entertaining.

UPDATE: Have played this quite a bit more, and it definitely improves with playtime. Eventually you have many options and are more powerful and defeat will become very rare, and the game becomes more fun at that point.

Man, sounds really good. This may be the first Kickstarter I really regret not getting in on.

Update: reprint coming to Kickstarter in April 2017. Woot!

Update: backed the second printing on KS, due for [-]August[/-] November 2017 delivery.

Update: holy smokes. Believe the hype. Three of us tackled this over the holidays. Punching out and sorting alone was at least a half hour, and even after watching some videos our first scenario run was easily 2+ hours and we lost. It's not really that complicated though and we played twice more in the same night at around an hour per scenario.

Gloomhaven is "just" a dungeon crawler with a campaign system, but saying so is really a disservice to how terrific the game is. The Euro-y combat mechanics are fantastic, the monster AI and bookkeeping is smooth, the character progression system and campaign are very well done - everything is just excellent and feels polished to the nth degree. Even the fact that the designer made his own world and didn't quite stick to traditional fantasy tropes (no orcs and dwarves, no traditional classes like fighter and cleric - the Scoundrel is the only thing I've seen so far that seems pretty similar to a standard fantasy Rogue) helps set this apart.

Gloomhaven is the best dungeon crawler / pseudo-RPG game out there, hands down. So glad I bit on the second Kickstarter to guarantee myself a copy.

The ultimate tactical, dungeon crawl, RPG experience for me. I've never enjoyed dicefests, but have always wanted a thematic RPG board game.

It has taken over my dining room table for the foreseeable future.

Isaac is a genius.

12/4/2017 9 initial rating after 4 2-player plays and 2 solo plays and 1 4-player game.  Occasionally i have a brief flash of fighting tedium.  But overall it is very engaging, and the campaign and level ups are addicting.  

I feel it might supplant mage knight as my #1 solo game (which i never thought would happen).  The combat and card play has a very mage knight feel to it to me, though less fiddly and less of a beat down than mage knight is.  If mage knight somehow had a campaign mode, it might keep it's top spot, but it doesn't.

It loses some rating due to being so time intensive for setup and take down, which is a real bear despite a lot of effort I put into some storage organizing. Notably worst than any game in my collection, on par with descent, which I no longer have.

Good dungeon crawling RPG. Interesting characters and mechanics, emphasizes hard on the theme itself, worth delving into. On the downside there are a lot of rules that you need to understand and keep in mind ALWAYS, which can be frustrating at times. You will have to read the rules over and over again until you have it all covered and this can break the game flow quite a bit in the beginning, but it's awesome once you're more experienced.
Don't worry, if you don't succeed a scenario on the first run. Just decrease complexity and retry.

This is a serious contender as my favourite game to date.

EDIT: after 3 plays, I’d put in Top 40, at least. Changed rating from 8 to 9.

RATING: 8.5
Both love and hate this game: love the hand/action mechanic and agree with monster focus/attack/move rules, but I feel like this is lost somewhere in between an RPG and videogame dungeon crawler without the additional strengths/benefits each offer. 
Anyone who has had the pleasure of tearing into a D&D module will be left unfulfilled by the scenario book, just like anyone who played Diablo will be unfulfilled with the time a single scenario takes (especially with the number of lost scenarios you will face)

Before Gloomhaven I never thought you can make a strategic co-op with so many choices. Imagine a RPG with great combat like Divinity Original Sin or Baldurs gate translated into tabletop, that would be Gloomhaven.

RATING: 10
This is the best game I've ever played. We got the 2nd edition via kickstarter sometime in December and in less than a month we've probably gotten in 60+ hours of play across 20+ scenarios. We have 11 of the 17 characters available to play but have only used 7 characters so far and have a ton left to explore in the game. The decisions are fantastic, the scenarios are different and strategically interesting. The card selection before the scenario, the items, they all really matter. It's not a perfect game -- Isaac could still improve upon some minor things in the next chapter down the road, and yet it's still better than anything I've ever played. I just played it all weekend and want to play more. Outstanding. All the free apps available help with some fiddlyness a bit, highly recommended.

Sadly, the more I play Gloomhaven, the more I find I'm playing only to see what unlocks next instead of playing because I find it fun.

I don't think "Gloomhaven" is a bad game, and if you enjoy the core-gameplay-loop you'll likely have a ton of fun with it. But for me, it feels like I'm grinding in an old-school MMORPG. I'm doing the work that's mandatory to get the thing I want. And that's not a feeling I want from a board game.

Literally the first time I have ever preordered anything. Will be a top 10 of 2017 and a classic.

Update: Preordered through Miniature Market in December and just found out I am getting boned. They conveniently held onto my money for three months (ultimately Isaac or MM is to blame) before deciding to tell me my order won't be fulfilled. I won't be getting my copy for who knows how long and I refuse to pay $300 for a copy through eBay. 

I haven't been given a legitimate answer as to why this went down the way it did, but it has left me pretty bitter.

Our group played this for the first time and really loved it.  We probably took much longer to setup than needed but after figuring out most of the setup ourselves then reading the quick start guide listed on BGG it would HIGHLY recommend just starting with the quickstart guide. You will want to reference the first page of the rulebook and look at the pictures of the cards. Overall the first scenario was great and we are looking forward to playing the next one in a few days!

Wowser. Only 7 plays in, and I was a little cynical of the hype but it's certainly got that pull that makes you not only want to play again as soon as you finish a scenario but leaves you thinking about it in-between.

RATING: 10
I am pretty tough with my ratings and don't give out a 10 star lightly. Dollar for dollar I have not made a better purchase of a board game. 

99% spoiler free review, nothing will ruin any of the surprises or classes. Just enough to give you some insight on how the game works.

What I found in this heavy box was a very deep tactics style RPG with tons of content  (hundreds of hours). It's a lite version of D&D without the need for a DM. I have been playing D&D for over 30 years and have a dozen dungeon crawler board games and this hands down is my favorite. 

Story: 
There is some nice flavor narrative for each mission as well as an overarching story. It's well written but not as deep as a pen and paper game. I still found it light years beyond the nearest direct competitor. My group has enjoying the events that have happened but I will not disclose any elements of the story in this review.

Characters/Classes:
17 (I have not unlocked them all and will not spoil them)
The races are not entirely based on Tolken / mythology like most other games. The classes are also not copies of D&D. I really appreciate the work done to make new fantasy races but still have them familiar enough that you have an idea on how they should act. From what I have seen each is quite unique. They have unique abilities and even the way their "dice" decks evolve is different. You start with a choice of 6 and unlock the others through gameplay.

Scenario/Dungeons:
90+ in the box, some additional available free online including a solo scenario for each class. Each scenario represent a normal game session. It's a couple of hours long depending on the number of players. There are branching scenarios so by doing one you might cut off another. This adds somewhat to the replayability. There is also a scenario generator in the game that creates random scenarios. At any time you can just make up new 3 room dungeon that is already balanced. 

Town:
The town of Gloomhaven levels up separately from the players. It depends on player choices as well as some random events. As the town levels up new items unlocked for purchase. This level also impacts new characters / players as they join the campaign. 

Random events:
There are cards that make up the random events that happen outside of a scenario. They are both good and bad. It adds some flavor to the world much in the same way random encounters work in D&D. 

Final comments:
I am by no means a expert on this game. I do not want to spoil it for myself so it will take a long time for me to see everything to make a 100% comprehensive review.  I have played it several times a week with 3 people for two straight months. I feel like that was enough time for me to understand the game, see most of enemies and core mechanics to write an honest detailed review.

I really hope that this game gets expansions in the future. I'd love to see a new continents to explore, enemies to fight, and new classes to unlock.  I haven't come close to exhausting the existing content, but the design could easily scale up in the same way that pen and paper RPGs do.

RATING: 9
After 5 games played (doing a 2-player campaign):

A dungeon-crawl system like Descent, which I used to love way back when, but with:
- a more elegant campaign system built in right from the start. You pick one of 6 characters to start the game, play for a while developing it, then eventually retire it and choose another (with more options being unlocked as you play the game). You have just one scenario to start the game, but that opens up two, and from there game paths can diverge (a lot, it seems?). 
- a simpler but more interesting system for character development: as you gain experience, you can customize your combat deck and action cards
- a great action card system: players have unique decks of cards each showing an initiative number, a top half, and a bottom half. Each round, everyone uses 2 (one on top); turn order set by the numbers on top. On your turn, use the top of one card, the bottom of the other. Tops are usually attacks (melee, ranged, variable additional effects or bonuses), bottoms are usually moves or special effects. You have to plan but can change your plans on the fly if necessary (in a limited way). 
- a very cool AI for the monsters, once you can figure it out (I think we've almost got it!).

At this point, the only negatives I see are:
1. It's a co-op. Fortunately, gameplay is interesting enough to overcome this shortfall.
2. The rulebook is big! There's a lot to learn, a lot of nuances to grok. Fortunately it's mostly straightforward.
3. I guess it would be nice if we had the super-pretty minis like we did in Descent, but the box is already ginormous so I'm okay with standees!

There is a lot to keep track of when it comes to components, but the rule book is very good and the gameplay is both tactical and thematic. Organized storage will go a long way towards making the game an even better experience.

RATING: 10
Immediately one of my top 10 games of all time.  I really enjoy dungeon crawlers but haven't found a board game that really gave me anything I don't feel I get better out of either RPGs or video games.  This is the first one I think with the systems that really give that to me.  The premise itself isn't really much different from other similar games like Descent but the way that deck and hand management, enemy management, progression, adventure discovery, etc. work is just all so refined and well done and melds together perfectly.  I can't really explain all the systems in such a small form factor but 'elegant' is the best word to use to describe it.

This game has some minor legacy type features.  You put stickers on a board as you unlock new adventures as well as unlock a few envelopes and "prestige class" like character types as your characters progress to a certain point.  The box is gigantic, the biggest I think I've ever had on my shelf but that is because it is chock-full of awesome stuff.

It looks amazing as well with high production values and great artwork.  I really have nothing negative to say about this game.

Kickstarted.

A very good game concept. But there are many, many moving parts, perhaps too many for a game which, at its core, is relatively simple. It was difficult to table, and without having any luck contacting the designer regarding an idea I had early in play (I mean, he could at least have acknowledged my emnail), my enthusiasm waned. Without the desire for the group to play it, I had to let it go. May have been a mistake, but I'm currently not heartbroken about it.

Initial reaction,  have to play more. I am surprised that the game gets such incredibly high ratings, I believe it might be because only the most motivated players even try to tackle this beast. I have seen several good things, but the game is simply overproduced. Too many chits, too many details to take care of, too much preparation before a game and too much time to put back in the box. If it was only preparation, I would say "fine", but there are so many things to micro-manage that I end up being too conscious of the mechanisms all the time to really immerse myself in the game universe. This game needs to have a lot of things handled through an app. I understand that there is one right now, but it's not nearly enough.

It plays a lot like a D&D game, unsurprisingly. But for me since I am not a fan of role playing a version that has more rules and structure makes the experience more enjoyable. Learning the rules is overwhelming (just as with plethora of components) there is a lot to take and going with that halfway through the 1st scenario we realized there were a few things we were playing wrong. But the actual game play is not that complicated. 
I quite like the cards and how you need to choose between top and bottom action and how with resting (which you need to do) your deck gets smaller: choices and strain make every game better. 
Still, I will surely need to see after a few more scenarios how I feel. I played the Vermling and like him but am a bit sad that the with the nature of the game and you improving a character you will want to play with the same character instead of trying different ones.
Rating will be adjusted over time, for now a solid 7 that could go either way.

Update: Played a second character (spellweaver) twice and vermling twice and I am getting more and more into the game. The devil in the details sometimes still confuses and frustrates me but overall the game is really growing on me. I like it so much more than D&D, what a bit more structure can do to my enjoyment of this type of game :-)

2 plays in and this obviously fired nearly every other Dungeon Crawler/FF game made.  Can see why it has received so much love. Tremendous value compared to FF dungeon crawlers + expansions. The personal goals and scenario goals keep the party pulling a little away from a common goal. Monster AI great. The randomness of initiative and diminishing hand size create deliciously tough timing issues in the party, after more plays I sure we will bed in together. As of May 2017 this is the only game I want to play and is therefore a 10

Very much enjoy this game, and I do think that it is worthy of the hype.  Dungeon crawls are a popular theme in board gaming, but this one does it so differently and so elegantly.  Coupling that with the wonderful legacy style game and the story that it weaves makes it a top game in my opinion.  The only down side is that the game can be a bit fiddly, and the need for some form of organizer in the box is essential (I use dollar store plastic divider boxes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great alternative to normal dungeon crawlers. Very thinky and feels a lot like a videogame. It feels a lot like the Mage Knight board game in that everything you do; from moving, attacking, to picking up loot, is all done via the cards in your hand. So, every turn you take is a new puzzle. On the down side, I feel like an organizer is vital for this game, to reduce the fairly long setup and breakdown times.

Elegant system, but I am in scenario 3 and where's the interactivity with the world?  I have been following a set path so far; boring.  Road events are too generic and boolean with little real decision-making.  Each scenario is a bit tedious and I am not sure the character cards have been well-developed.  The characters themselves seem very interesting and real.  The rulebook is not very well organized.  Quite a few unanswered questions.  Don't understand the fuss yet.  I have to mention, that I have been playing solo.  It is probably a lot more tedious that way.  Also, overall, way too much effort for the reward.

Tl;dr It's 22 lbs of amazing.  This is like having an epic DnD campaign where no one has to be the DM.  

Mostly dungeon crawls, and mostly about killing all the enemies, but as you explore, you unlock new locations.  Players can also travel back to the city to re-equip and get random encounters on the road.  All players form a party that can gain and lose reputation, increase the prosperity of the town, unlock global achievements, etc.  Individual characters have personal goals that once they achieve, will retire and unlock new character classes.  

Characters who complete missions will gain gold and experience, and can level up, gaining access to new skills and abilities.  Characters can also improve their odds in battle by completing mini-goals during scenarios.  They also can buy equipment, loot dead monsters, or open treasure chests to reveal more stuff.

Combat is handled by cards, and selecting which hand of cards you take into battle can be it's own puzzle, because your hand size is limited.  Each round, you use up two cards, but if you run out of cards in your hand, you can shuffle discards, permanently losing access to one of them.  If they all run out, you're exhausted and out of the scenario.  There are other ways you lose cards from your discard pile as well  If everyone becomes exhausted, you lose.

Randomness is also a factor, because each character has a combat deck that could improve or hinder their attacks, with one critical hit and one critical miss card.  Players can modify this deck through achievements that grant perks.  Players can select which perk to gain, and when a character retires, they can pass some of those perks on to the next character that player will use. 

Monsters are controlled by some pretty basic A.I. rules, but each type of monster has its own deck of cards telling the players what they will do that round, as well as a monster attack modifier deck.  Difficulty of monsters can be scaled from level 0-7, and each monster type has stats for basic and elite units (with special abilities).  There is a fair bit of bookkeeping that has to be done during the round, and lots of little cardboard bits to help keep tack of temporary modifiers.

What's great about the game is the narrative arc that takes place during the scenario.  Each player starts out with a whole lot of potential, and facing some known enemies, but no one knows what lurks behind closed doors.  As they go through combat, their ability deck acts like a countdown timer until they will be exhausted, so there is a rush to blitz through all the enemies, but you have to have a plan.  

In our first mission, there were three rooms, and after clearing the first room, two of us were almost exhausted, and I didn't think we would make it.  And when we opened the third door to a room full of monsters, I was certain we were going to fail.  But we managed to eke out a victory, and it was very satisfying to do so.  The icing on the cake was the flavor text in the scenario book, which has 95 different story-driven missions.  Add to that a map that unlocks locations as you play by placing stickers, and you have a very cool game.

Really my favorite dungeon crawl style game to date. The hand management aspect to combat is extremely satisfying. The campaign/story growth are interesting, but the real heart of the game is its dungeon-crawling combat. The rest is mostly window dressing. 

The variety of abilities and mechanics between races is also very well done. And leveling those characters, while slow provides plenty of options to customize your play.

Probably the most laborious set-up and tear-down of any game I own, however. I would have preferred a little more stream-lining, but I'm sure there are plenty of people who would never consider removing anything from that giant box.

RATING: 5
I can see the potential in the campaign/legacy part of the game. But the dungeon/skirmish part seems very drawn out and slow with 4 players. I think this game works best for 1-2 players. With 3+ I would prefer Descent. The card mechanics don't seem all that different to dice, and disappointed me quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a good game, if not the second coming.  It has the best combat of any dungeon crawler I've played.  That may be class dependent, though.  Besides that, the atmosphere, writing, and legacy elements are all lacking 10 games in, so the storytelling aspects of the game (D&D in a box) are aren't doing much for me.  Almost every scenario is a variation on 'go kill stuff', which could wear thin.  Still, the combat is so good that I'm happy to keep playing. 

We started with 4, and then we went down to 3.  The game seems much better and tighter at 3 players.  Also, we've never lost a mission.  I'm not sure how I'll feel when we do.  It's been close a few times.  I would dread having to actually redo a whole mission, but the fear of losing has to be there for the game to actually be fun.  It doesn't seem like the rewards scale very well for choosing harder difficulties, which irks me.

Playing 2 scenarios a day currently, either solo or with the wife when she wants to join. Using plano boxes and other storage solutions has greatly decreased set-up/tear down, so the biggest complaint would be losing a scenario in the last room.

I played this game. Then I played it again. Then I played it again. Then I played it again solo...

I just don't see the appeal or the consideration that it's "the best game of all time", because it isn't. Yes, it's quite impressive with everything you get, especially for the price... But for the same price I may as well download some DLC scenarios for other games I enjoy and can replay over and over. 

And the set-up/take-down time... Oh, God. That's an instant point deduction for me for any game, no matter how perfect it is outside of just that con. But with Gloomhaven, I just had no fun with it. I know that opinion will probably exile me from the Gloomhaven community for having such a POV, but I just have to be honest about it.

I do hope that some day down the line, something is done with this game (not something fan-created) that actually makes the game good. Until then... 4.

Update Sept17: we are well up in our 42nd scenario, have unlocked all but 4 characters and are at prosperity 5 ^^
There is not the slightest hint that we will get tired of the game any time soon. My vote will not change. This is a masterpiece and deserves my 10 :)
Looking forward to break in the 2nd edition as well and try the scenarios Isaac planned for after the release!

Oct23 ... 53 scenarios in and still looking great :)

I'm enjoying it and as dungeon crawl style games go for me its definitely the most enjoyable of them thus far. Some of the upkeep elements feel to slow things down and my biggest concern thus far is while the enemies have been different and maps are different the goal has really been the same...kill kill kill... Where my rating goes from here will very much depend if it just keeps to be more or less the same in the next sessions or if objectives shift in interesting ways.

Given a 9 after 1 play - immediately got buyers remorse after backing the second edition, assuming that there was no way this could live up to the hype and that I'd just been swept along by the hotness...Am delighted to discover that the whole package appears to be as good as advertised! great character development, interesting story bits and a superlative set of dungeon crawl mechanics that blow every other game in its class out of the water for me. 

 Of course I might discover things I don't like as we go along, or find out that some of the stuff to do with the ongoing stories of both the world and the individual characters don't work as well as they look like they will, but I'm confident I'll continue to be a big fan of this monster.

 Just hope I get to play it regularly!

RATING: 9
Tentative rating after 2 games. The systems are interesting and this basically just kills Descent completely. Card play and customizing your character is very fun and I feel like there can be a lot of depth to the game with very few rules in comparison to other dungeon crawlers. My rating could go up or down based on the unlock packs and the overall story / character story. Either way, I'm having fun and looking forward to playing it again.

The only real negative I have with some aspects of the game are the whole looting money system. It feels weird that everyone is fighting over money and it takes additional actions to "Loot" or whatever. I know the game is balanced around it, but it feels like a weird decision to include. Also, the ability to replay scenarios over and over and "grind" XP and gold feels weird as well. I think I would have preferred a single run through without the ability to come back. Finally, the scenario book is good, but it kind of spoilers a lot of the surprise for one player who has to set it up. Unsure if the game should just be played completely open save for closed packs / flipped cards or if we actually know all the potentialities of each scenario that you'd learn from replaying something again and again.

EDIT: After 10+ plays I still enjoy the game, although I wish more scenarios had special conditions or things going on. The escort missions and loot missions and some others make it a lot more interesting and fun. Retiring is decently interesting and injects some personal story. Might downgrade the game slightly if it doesn't keep the strength in the upcoming plays, but so far it is great and fills the "dungeon crawl" board game part completely.

EDIT: After 30+ players the game is still fun but getting a bit repetitive. As stated before, there needs to be more special scenarios instead of just "kill everything." I bumped my rating up from an 8.75 to a 9 after seeing how looting money isn't a huge deal towards the end and after making a few minor house rules that helps improve the game out.

EDIT: Finished the main game and the meta goal at 53 games (more in total since we rotated some people around). I'm unsure if it is a solid 9, but it is closer to a 9 than an 8.75 I think with some house rules to make it flow better.

The house rules I'd recommend are the following:

* After playing 1 more scenario once a character reaches level 9 a person can automatically complete their personal agenda (still have to do associated scenarios if it requires them). This stops some insane personal goals or ones that require you to replay tons of scenarios.

* Items gained from treasure chests can be given to any other party member after the scenario. This reduces the sheer randomness of getting an amazing item that simply doesn't work for your character and could have been picked up by someone else.

* Remaking your character before each scenario. In the sense that when you level up and pick a new card you're not required to only have that card, but can effectively "re-spec" before each scenario. This let's players fully play out a class and experience it without feeling tons of regret over picking a bad card.

There are a few other minor ones here and there, but that's the general gist of the rules I'd recommend changing just to make the game flow better.

A lot of mixed feelings. I hate the legacy element; the designer said he would make files available to replay, but it takes a lot of work and it needs to be done upfront.
Rulebook is a slog, and has several confusing or clearly wrong rules.
Gameplay is heavy on planning and number-crunching, low on theme. (There is however a ton of poor and irrelevant flavor text). Character advancement seems focused on people who want to do advanced math analysis.
Feels like the a lot of effort went in to making the game hard to replay, but very little into making it easy to play.
Town/City cards are awful; might as well just roll a die to see what random bonus/penalty you get, since the choices are meaningless.
However, the actual core gameplay was pretty cool. Tough decision making and planning (probably tougher since we didn't bother to pre-plot everything like you probably should).

The complexity and enormity of what Gloomhaven is trying to achieve is admirable - and they almost pull it all off. As a four player board game with roleplaying and really strong legacy aspects it is unsurpassed. The balance and depth to the many character classes are exceptional. Having played for almost a year now (just over half way through) I would acknowledge it lets itself down slightly on certain random events and the repetitious nature of many (kill everything) scenarios. However that does not take away from what they have accomplished - a true 9 out of 10 game, which although it appears expensive is actually amazing value for money; due to the enormous number of hours of play in a single box.

Kickstarter. Tactical dungeon crawler for 1-4 players. Okay as a solitare, best at 2-3 (4 is a bit crowded, and slow). Legacy games are not for me - I prefer games where you finish in one session. That being said this game is still okay. Rules are a bit complicated - some of the stuff could easily have been removed without affecting anything seriously. Beeing cooperative you can skip a lot and it's quite easy to teach others to play if you stick to the basics. Setup time is far to long though. There are lots of components (tons of stuff that's only used once) but variation is still quite low - each game is very similar to the previous one, making it slightly boring after a while. I will play this mainly solo, and only sporadically with others. Rating it at 6.

Initially I was a bit disappointed with Gloomhaven despite everyone else in my group loving it immediately. It’s not that I dislike the game. I just felt it fell dramatically short of the hype.

However I’ve found my enjoyment of the game has been steadily increasing with every play since and I now really really enjoy the game. The hype is still pretty absurd IMO, but I would probably rank it in my top 10 nonetheless. It’s a great game.

Fantastic game with game play that isn't as daunting to play as one would expect. Only reason I give it 9 out of 10 is due to having to come up with a separate storage system in order to make take set up and take down manageable and a few pieces requiring re-gluing.

RATING: 7.5
Solid dungeoncrawler. Gameplay is a bit puzzly, so this one requires more brains than the usual dungeoncrawler type game. This is both a pro and a con, as usually I break out these type of games when I just want to sit back, relax and whack some skulls.

That being said, the puzzly part itself is excellent, and if you do have the braincells to spare the fights are really cool and certainly more involved as 'move up to the dude up to my movement allowance, whack skull, get whacked, whack again, creature dies, loot, repeat' as present in so many of its competitors.

What elevates the game is the fact that it is set in a complete campaign world that actually feels pretty alive. I'm NOT rating that into the 7.5 I'm giving because as though it does add to the immersion between levels and when setting up, it has no effect on the levels themselves. Also, the game is so big it is nearly impossible to set up with a regular group: it is a complete world in and of itself. And though it is an excellent skirmisher, it is a boardgame, which means artificial limitations, which mean it is inferior to a well-run role-playing game. Also, it is heavy (non-portable), pricy and the lack of a decent insert is killing for setup.

However... it completely kills Descent. It completely kills Heroquest, D&D adventure game, D&D Ravenloft (or any of that series) or almost any other fantasy themed skirmish game. Simply because of its solid gameplay. For that, and for its completeness, I almost feel I'm not giving this a high enough rating. Following BGG rating suggestions: I'm not suggesting it to others as it is a game people really should buy into: a casual skirmish game is only so-so, this needs to be played as part of a campaign.

Being a boardgame, it is the closest thing to an actual role-playing game I've ever seen, but I'd still prefer a well-run roleplaying game over Gloomhaven. For me I think it just scratches this role-play itch.. leaving me wanting to role-play more instead of playing Gloomhaven. But if you do have the group, like fantasy themed skirmish games, like role-playing but don't want or cannot find someone to act as overlord/DM/Gamemaster, and if you're not planning to have a collection of games to choose from pending on occasion and party, this could be THE game for you. If all those factors describe you, up my rating with 2 points for this game: solid 9.5.

It is an awesome game to just delve into. It makes you realize you simply don't have time enough to explore everything of it. Next to 7th Continent, this game will look at me for too long before finally getting played through all the way. Though this offers the chance of finally clearing out a major part of my games collection, keeping only the unique ones... like this one.

The dungeon crawl is entertaining, interesting and a good challenge. I love how Isaac has solved the alpha player problem via battle goals, loot that isn't shared, and the hidden information. The enemy AI system is excellent. I enjoy the planning in one phase, and then adjusting your plan in reaction to both the AI and the other players. And then there's the tons of loot, scenarios, ability cards and character classes to explore. The writing is good too. Wow. I'm stunned.

Normally, big box full of dungeon crawl is not my cup of tea.  This game, however, does so much more.  It has so many more strategic elements, and the mechanics (the multi-use cards with an action selection feel and the need for serious planning regarding the order in which they are played and returned) are surprisingly deep for a game of this variety.  Yet, the game is just dripping with theme and creativity.  Also, the box is full of so much content, and the characters all have such a unique style about them.

This game is truly awe-inspiring.  A dungeon crawler in my top 25 games?  What?  Yeah, this one deserves it, even though I won't play through more than 10-20% of its content because these types of games just feel samey to me after a rather brief (but enjoyable, in this case) period.

Wow - this game is surprisingly good. The core combat mechanisms at the heart of the game are solid and interesting, with some luck but an emphasis on hard choices. It's a euro-gamer's dungeon crawl enhanced with an interesting, dynamic campaign that also offers meaningful choices. And the value is through the roof, with the number of great bits you get and the completeness (no expansions) right out of the box. A true gem.

It's not  a board game - it's a project! For me, the cardboard version of the Legend of Zelda games. I love the world, that feeling when you explore and upgrade your characters, open a new envelope or put a new sticker on the map. Even though you same thing over and over (explore a dungeon, kill monsters, open chests, open one more chest, kill even more monsters), I cannnot get bored when Gloomhaving - maybe it's the brilliant gameplay mechanism or maybe just wanting to see how the world and your characters will change if you are done with one more scenario.

I was lucky enough to be among the first wave of kickstarter backers to receive their copies of Gloomhaven. It was far larger than I anticipated, and though I thought it was pretty and the gameplay was promising, I didn't expect to fall in love with it. But fall in love with it we did.

The thing to understand about this game is that it's not just a game, it's a campaign. The title of legacy is somewhat misleading. Yes the game changes as you play it, but that's because you're developing your character within a longer campaign. Folks usually think of legacy as being a game you can only play x number of times because the secret keeps you moving forward. This game has secrets and your game does change over time, but is much more similar to RPGs than to Pandemic Legacy or Seafall.

To say that there are 95 scenarios isn't doing the game justice. There are 95, yes, but in the 9 that we have played, the strategy has been different for every map. The shape of the map and the kinds of enemies dramatically changes how we strategize.

This really is a game that you have to learn how it wants you to play, and if you play it based on how you have played other dungeon crawlers, it will absolutely beat you down. It is not a game where you move forward and deal damage. It is a game of teamwork and planning. It is a game of learning not only how your character works best, but also how it works best with the other members of your team. There's long term planning as you look over the level objective and the rooms you are in, but there's also short term planning when you try to survive just that round to move forward. There's also the question of whether you risk playing a one-time card early on and limiting your number of turns, or risk spending extra turns to avoid that card. There's also strategy in building your deck. There is a limited pool of cards available to you initially, and it slowly grows. But almost every card is intriguing and valuable, and you have to build the deck that you think will work for that particular scenario. If you take the same deck in without thinking of strategy, it's a recipe for failure.

This game is hard, but it's hard because it wants you to learn it. It wants you to be clever and always look towards the next turn. And that's a big part of what makes it exciting. Knowing you have a time constraint  and knowing that you need to keep moving leads to a lot of, "I don't see how we can win this" halfway through scenarios, but also incredibly engrossing and tense card selections and reveals. And when you manage to, without knowing exactly what the other players are doing, pull off a combined attack or move on your last possible turn and you accomplish the goal, it's the sweetest victory. You've won and you've won together against what feels like impossible odds.

Listen, I understand the pull of being smug and hating on whatever latest thing is hyped to bits. I get it. I'm always incredibly willing to be skeptical of the latest hotness and keep my cold heart locked away. But I have never in my life gotten so excited about a game so quickly. If we didn't like it, we would honestly just sell it for tons of money. I've spent more on a game and admitted it was awful before selling it for a loss. But that's not the case with Gloomhaven, I promise. We've been waiting for something like this. It's clever and tight, engrossing and full of surprises. It's the first game we've ever left out for longer than a night. It's been an entire month! We live in an apartment and gave up our game card table and half of our living room for it.

This is the real deal. Give it a couple of sessions to learn. It rewards you for it. And I suspect that this will be rewarding me for at least a couple of years, likely longer.

Great dungeon crawling implementation, and I like where the campaign mechanics are going. My main holdup is whether this is something I'm actually going to play often enough to make it worth the cost, keeping in mind that aside from my #1 (which Gloomhaven will not displace), I play my favorite games at most 20 times a year.

On the other hand $5 a play over the course of a year (and more to come) isn't an unreasonable amount. Hmmmm.

I tried this out single player (driving two characters), and while it's an okay challenge to just take out some characters and do the dungeon crawl / XP grind alone I suspect the game is much more fun at two or three. Four might slow it down a little too much, but the main decision point is made simultaneously so maybe it'll be okay.

Fantastic!.  Very well designed, lots of content and quite easy to play.  For a board rpg game this may be the best (Though it cant compete with a proper rpg, but for that you need a DM).  There are a few wonky things though that veteran rpg players will find jarring (knowing whole map setup before you enter, traps being visible, the whole I cant tell anyone my initiative thing, and more).  Still the game was very fun and I very much look forward to playing it more.  I loved the hand management aspect.

4/6/2017: Just upped my rating from 8 to 9. After the 3rd play of this game, I like it more and more. There are a lot of different game mechanics that I think work really well together, e.g. multi-use for cards (top and bottom), initiative number for turn order, card depletion, mission and character quests, character progression, and many more. The combinations of all of these make the game to be one of the best games that I have played and certainly one that deserves the rank in BGG and hype it received so far. I am glad that it is back in print again. A lot more people need to play this and be awed by the brilliance of this game! :)
___________________________________________________________
3/2/2017: This is the second dungeon crawl game that I played.

During the first play, I used the Virmling Mindthief. This character is not as straight forward to play. It has the abilities to summon the rat to help the character, and controlling enemies, which are very different than a straight hack and slash character.

This game is certainly not the game that you can get the full grasp with only 1 play. It warrants multiple plays to fully understand your character and at the same time the character progression in skills and abilities. Additionally, the world around you also evolves with new monsters to fight and defeat. On the top of all of these, you can also change your character to a new one once you completed the character goal. This game is implemented perfectly with the legacy element. 

As for the game play, it has very interesting mechanics. The game count down is done elegantly through the use of cards. So in addition to the need to understand how to best play your character, you also need to plan out your move so that you don't run out of cards before the team accomplishes the mission (i.e. killing all of the bad guys). Combination of the legacy game and the mechanic makes it a very challenging game to play. 

I really can't wait to play the next scenario of the game. This truly has been a blast! :)

RATING: 10
Oh man... This has already locked in my favorite game of the year.  It is an incredibly produced and designed game that happens to hit on many of my favorite mechanisms.  Let me list some of my favorite aspects.

:star: The core gameplay of choosing two cards each turn where you use the top half of one card and the bottom half of the other card is simultaneously simple and deeply strategic.  Combine that with the fact that some cards are one-and-done and you also naturally lose cards over the course of the game, and I find myself constantly making meaningful decisions at every turn.  It's kind of like [thing=96848][/thing], but less fiddly.
:star: The enemies are awesome.  They are extremely variable (I think ~40 different types) and they each have their own strategy deck that fits their play style.  While most of the missions are just "kill everything in the dungeon", they feel very different because of how the enemies differ.  The AI deck is easy to use, although there are some strange corner cases.  This is 100 times better than having an overlord, imo.
:star: Customization galore!  You get to choose your items, which skill cards to unlock, which skill cards for each battle, and how you want to customize your combat deck.  As someone that loves LCGs for the deck construction aspect, this scratches that same itch.  Similarly, I used to play a lot of D&D, so this feels like home.
:star: There are so many things to unlock.  You start with 6 starter classes, but unlock another ~12 as the game goes on.  I am dying to see which character we unlock first.  Also, you retire your character after 10-15 missions, which is a pretty crazy idea.  But I've really warmed up to the idea and am looking forward to trying more.
:star: It's a unique setting.  No elves, dwarves, etc.  Instead we have rat people, crystal people, elementals, and several other unique races.  I play a lot of fantasy games, so this is a breath of fresh air to me.

If I had to pick nits, I would say:
:halfstar: The missions thus far are feeling a little same-y.  Combine this with the fact that character progression is a slow burn, and I fear my enthusiasm may decline a little bit over time.
:halfstar: The writing is average.  Maybe I am spoiled by [thing=205637][/thing], but a lot of the writing in this feels like a cliche.

So far I'm loving it and can't wait to play more.  The legacy aspect doesn't really scare me at all because you can play like 60 or 70 scenarios and they are ~2 hours each.  This is only the second game that I've gone straight to a 10 rating (the other being [thing=115746][/thing]).  We'll see if it holds up for the whole campaign.

It's a repetitive, hack and slash, typicalish dungeon crawl board game simulating a rinse-and-repeat RPG video game. Sounds like something I want to get far, far away from, but the reality is very different.

Highly addictive, engaging, variable (just enough) injected with all the theme and role play-like elements that it bridges the gap between tabletop, board game and video game. I could delve into this game for days on end and somehow find myself engaged the whole time. Yes, the set up and tear down time is too long. Yes, it is expensive, and a hulking box that makes you scratch your head and wonder why you aren't simply playing Warcraft online. But the card play, the immersion, the world building, the mechanics - I don't see myself tiring of it anytime soon.

Yet another EDIT: We are over 150 hours played at this point and have unlocked all the classes and probably seen most everything the game has to offer. There are still some minor complaints (I wish there were some cooler unlocks to go after other than characters for example and I feel the game could use a couple of more Wow! moments) but over all we are still enjoying ourselves quite a bit. I suspect we are moving toward the end of the game at this point, there are only two classes that have no been retired at least once and we are nearing the end of the major plot lines. I say we have played "over 150 hours" but I really stopped counting around 120 so I have no idea how many hours exactly we have played. For a group that owns 300+ board games and generally considers it worth having purchased the game if we get in 10 plays before it gets shelved, Gloomhaven is certainly our most played game ever and is probably the only game that all four of us would rate a 10.

Another EDIT: We are nearly 100 hours of game play (kind of lost track of exactly how much time we have put into this game) and it's still pretty awesome and I still look forward to getting it out every week.

EDIT: After over 40 hours of game play we have only come up with a few things that we truly disliked. The way advantage interacts with rolling modifiers, the blitz that occurs at the beginning of a scenario (or sometimes when you open a door), the disparity in speed for some characters (sometimes it just seems a character cannot be fast enough to do what the character seems it is meant to do) and how easy it is for some characters to get loot and XP and how hard it seems to be for other characters. None of these things are remotely deal breakers however and over all we are still very excited to continue and see where things go. Two characters have retired at this point and the way the group is forced to change is quite intriguing.  

Original Post:
I can't say this will stay a 10 for me forever and of course the legacy aspect means that it could dip simply because of what comes next (Pandemic Legacy fell pretty hard after completing the campaign and finding it less than fulfilling) but at the moment this game is amazing. 

We have two people in our group that have always wanted to play more of the so called D and D in a box style games but in general co op games do not appeal to the other two members of the group. This is even more true when you are looking at games that are move, roll dice, kill stuff... repeat. If there isn't enough decision making they simply wont last.

However Gloomhaven has a lot of decision making and the legacy aspect helps it immensely.  All four of us are enjoying this game and while there have been a few complaints (the Scoundrel character seems to get more XP AND more gold than the rest of us being probably the biggest gripe) over all this game has been a massive success.

It's such an elaborate design, so grand and so beautiful, I'd love to rate this higher. But however smart and innovative  the design is ( and that it is: really smart! Combat, Difficulty setting etc. just to name a few things that stand out), it's a dungeon crawler. And a very challenging one at that. Why do I play Dungeon Crawlers (Boardgames and Videogames alike)? Because I love to loot and I love to see my character evolve from a pushover to the arcmaster of the arcane. And I love to see progress soon. No need to jump from 0 to 100 in a day, but the next step from 0 shouldn't have to be waited for too long. 
Admittedly, we (Spellweaver, Tinkerer, Brute) probably didn't play well on our first 3-player game, but we stood absolutely no chance against the first scenario set to normal difficulty.  We hardly made it to the final room. There was bad luck involved too. The road surely didn't kill us with kindness and several times during combat we drew the right cards at the wrong time and the wrong cards also - at the wrong time. And drawing cards at the wrong time is, when compared to a dice-based combat system, like rolling low when you need to roll high. With one big difference - it's like rolling low when you need to roll high taking thrice as long! Because you went back and forth in your mind making plans, trying to figure out the best move that also leaves you with the best options for the turns ahead. Rolling a die doesn't involve this kind of planning. A die resists plans. When you roll it, it says "Whatever, dude!" 
Don't get me wrong. There are enough dice-based combat games out there and like I said above, I dig the mechanics of the game. But with the time I have for board games these days, it'll be hard to get this to the table. You'd need to play this at least once a week to really immerse oneself in the campaign and sometimes I don't get to play in a month. I'd love to play more frequently and I truely wish to play this game more, but that's not entirely in my hands.

It's a big ol' box, and it is chalk full of stuff... and that stuff is good. This game is fun to play, filled with variety and choices to customize your play experience to taste... play alone, play with friends. And the content is just... endless... and not in a bad way. It's pricey (especially if you aren't paying retail, since copies are in short supply and some people are profiting off that on ebay), but the amount of stuff in the box and the time it can kill, it's all but a bargain. I'd estimate this game could kill about 200 hours without repeating a single scenario. Now, that time is only as fun as you find the game, of course... changing characters and playstyles can mix things up, but it is ultimately one game, and that's a long time to play one game. A few points of advice? Big, long setup/teardown... pulling down one scenario and setting up another can take more than an hour pretty easily.... I DO find however transitioning from one to another takes less time than putting the game away and pulling it back out... so marathoning multiple maps in one go is just time efficient. Likewise, consider investing in and an accordion folder... you can only speed up your setup/teardown so much even then, but honestly you'll want to do what you can to shear down that time.

Great dungeon crawler. 
Rating based upon playing one scenario. May increase with more plays.

Impressions so far: 
Long setup and take down time - needs a large table dedicated to the game for longer periods for efficient play.

Very interesting game mechanics - however when playing solo I tend to get stuck in AP. May loosen up when I become more familiar with the game rules. 

A lot of mental overhead to make sure playing the game correctly. I have the feeling of being both the player and the cpu in a computer adventure game. A rather time consuming process but a great, fun, and satisfying mental workout. I expect this will be less pronounced when getting used to the game.

Thus, so far, I have mixed feelings. Time will tell if I manage to work my way through the complete campaign.

RATING: 7
Enjoying the game so far, but I haven't been blown away by it.

The terrain rules should be streamlined. There are difficult terrain, obstacles, and traps that all have slightly different rules. Similarly, there are too many conditions that overlap.

Other than that, the gameplay is fine. It's all about managing your cards and the struggle between going for gold/experience versus completing the scenario objective.

Descent 2.0 (with the app) does it all better, but Gloomhaven is a nice change of pace.

Played twice, hated the card modifiers - they make zero sense. If I wanted RNG, dice would be much more suitable, especially for a dungeon crawler. In addition, the modifiers also decide between life and death - and most of the time you'll whiff half of your attacks! 

Found the theme to be generally quite dull, and feel that the game is massively over-rated despite the initial value for the entire contents if you backed the KS (£90-£110).

People who compare this to Kingdom Death: Monster and/or say it is better need a head examination. Perks are pathetically designed, but you'll need them if you ever want to make it through any number of scenarios without getting mauled to death by the number of shoddy modifiers. 

The campaign itself SUPER BORING, even the original 8-Bit/16-Bit RPG dungeon crawlers like Final Fantasy had masses of immersion for primitive technology. We are living in the 21st century, using the mightiest platform to promote the modern fantasy genre, and yet a developer has managed to create something worse for something so simple and so hyped! How has this happened!?

I'm not personally a D&D player (or other RPG player for that matter), but I found that there are a lot of twists and turns involved when the Gamemaster is able to freely create an ideal experience.

I hope to never find a game as disappointing as Gloom(and Doom)haven in my life ever again. 

RANT OVER.

This is a fun and exciting game. It is extremely long so you need to make sure you have the time to put in. It's kinda big so you'll need to have the space to play.

Pros - hidden initiative means you always need a back up plan, plenty of variety in characters and enemies, well balanced for multiple players and levels themselves often come down to a couple of turns before exhaustion.

Cons - levels can be linear (no time to explore) and therefore repetitive (clear room, find chest, rinse and repeat), set up and dismantle time can be lengthy.

RATING: N/A
Withholding a rating until I get further into the campaign.

But I will say where most of these games fall short is in the dungeon crawl itself, it is usually a fairly lame ability spam fest where you just run around doing your best DPS action over and over and then go back to town to gear up for another boring round of monotonous monster mashing.  Why even bother leveling up and improving the characters if playing with them in the game is boring?  

Gloomhaven flips this on it's head because it has come up with a card based action selection system that I can best describe as "streamlined Mage Knight".  You have a small (8-12?) hand of cards to work with that give you 2 possible actions (a top and a bottom) with an initiative value.  You have to chose which to use and then they are gone from your hand and possibly permanently.  So you need to really think about what you're doing and maximize your card play.  Brilliantly the cards in your hand also serve as a timer since your hand will shrink and once you have too few cards left you are out of the round.

I've really enjoyed playing the actual game here, and getting the occasional item or new ability card actually opens up new combinations and possibilities for more interesting card play.  

The juice seems to be worth the squeeze here so far.

The story elements to this point have been typical expected surface level board game stuff, but I'm only about 1/10th of the way through the campaign so maybe that will change, but even if it doesn't the game play itself is fun enough to keep me coming back....and we haven't even gotten to experiment with a ton of different classes yet.

In short the system itself seems to warrant the amount of content the designer has created within it and that is a HUGE departure from previous titles of this type.

only 7 games in so the rating might change. In my opinion, the fun of the game is the tactical combat combined with the sense of discovery and character progression. 

The things that keep it from a 9-10 for me: some unintuitive rules, ability cards layout could be better, long games and long setup time, huge time investment, the box is not very practical for storage.

Ok, this game is absolutely amazing, however it's a bit much: too many components, too many decks, too many tiles. 

They all add to setup/teardown time, that's time you're not enjoying the game.

On bigger maps, or on maps that have swarm-like enemies, managing their turns often becomes fatiguing. Yes it gets better with experience, however, it oftens feels more convoluted than it should.

I wish the game were more streamlined, where there would be less monster decks, maybe using a mechanic similar to the Boss "Special 1-Special 2" actions.

Using a generic map board, where you block off certain sections, depending on scenario, would dramatically decrease the setup time.

RATING: 9
The Fantasy Adventure game that sets the bar for all comparisons. A product of love and inspiration that dared to aim higher that any of its predecessors and broke a series of thresholds as it hit its marks to the surprise of most.

The Pros: 
1)It's so epic that it will redifine the word for you. 
2)Amazing monster and player class variability. 
3)Amazing in-class replayability. 
4)Solid mission design. 
5)A fully fledged world that will seep into your adventure one mission/event at a time. It's high fantasy but believable. 
6)Great gameplay with an amazing hand management system that is both simple to play and difficult to master. 
7)Pure co-op with an amazing AI (the best I've seen so far) that allows you to predict it just as much you should... most of the time, and more as you get more experience with each particular enemy.

The Cons: 
1)The futility of the level up design is more profound in such a long campaign. From a point on you simply realise your level doesn't matter (other than giving you more options), as the monsters level up with you.
2)The fatigue mechanism is generally solid after a few games, but it's still very anticlimactic and can feel like a real bummer for new players as they won't realize until too late that they need to conserve their strength/cards.
3)Losing a mission nets you benefits in the long term!, as you keep any gold/xp and get to replay it as many times as you need. There's a clear design hole here.
4)The retirement mechanism is interesting, and the upgrade (cards) mechanism absolutely fantastic, but one kind of kills the other.
5)The game is difficult to store it its box, and that has a side effect of increasing set up time until you get a storage solution.
6)I don't really like the loot system, and it's difficult to explain thematically why the heroes don't just loot the area clean after they win. This hurts more once you realize gold is what gives you an edge in battle.
7)The components are lacking in artwork. The boards are plain, the player cards have no artwork at all and the summons get a generic token that isn't even practical. The only exception are the monsters that have great artwork, and the items that are fine.
8)The gameplay is fairly prone to analysis-paralysis especially while you learn a class.

The game is a blast to play. None of its flaws is fatal, and each of its strong points is mindblowingly well achieved.

I'm playing solo.

Having just started the campaign (6 plays so far), it's way too early to give a final rating. However, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out a 10 pretty soon. 

Most dungeon crawls that I've played are way too random and fiddly. Sure, story can be important too, but honestly I'd rather play a pen and paper RPG without any dice etc if I'm looking for a true RPG experience. 

Gloomhaven is a different beast. It's basically a heavy euro puzzle (similar to Uwe's solo variants) that happens to take place in a dungeon crawl tactical combat theme, with a huge world that is really fun to explore. The core card play is what makes this game stand out though. It's so puzzly and can be really difficult and challenging. Needless to say, I'm very pleased so far.

First play through, and the game was just fantastic. 4 players chose Mindthief, Tinkerer, Cragheart, and Spellweaver. Took about 3 hours as most people were learning the rules, and there was some lost time finding the right tokens to punch out and referencing the rules, but between the FAQ and the rulebook, most issues were very clearly covered. The fun was epic though, starting from leaving town to the unexpected road event and finishing in a literal last possible turn slaying of the final baddie.

Combines RPG elements with a fantastic dungeon crawler while presenting the game as an intricate puzzle. The fantasy setting is unique and feels fresh because it purposefully avoids many fantasy tropes and cliches. The branching story paths and character options always leave me wondering with a "what if" feeling. 

One (EXTREMELY) minor complaint I have is that the game comes with 17 characters. 11 of which are unavailable at the start. So far, we've opened 3 new characters and would really like to see and play the remaining ones.

RATING: 5
Gloomhaven is a dungeon crawl. If you like that kind of thing, you'll probably really like it. But there are few games that bore me more than dungeon crawls.

The innovative twist to Gloomhaven is that you have a hand of cards and on a round you select two of them. One of your cards is the "lead" card for its initiative number. All the players and monsters resolve their turns in initiative order. On your turn you choose one card for its attack ability and the other for it's move ability. If the things you wanted to do aren't applicable anymore you can always use the card for its default attack ability of a 2 point attack or the default move ability of 2 move.

Cards are discarded after they're used, although more powerful cards get "lost". When you are running low on cards you have to decide whether to rest or not. Resting allows you to pick up your discarded cards but forces you to "lose" a card from those you picked up. Lost cards don't normally come back to you during the game, so they're a clock on how quickly you have to defeat the baddies.

Other than that it's a pretty standard dungeon crawl. There's an attack modifier deck for each player and all the bad guys which can augment or diminish the attack, rarely causing you to do double damage or miss completely. The other thing that makes Gloomhaven stand out is that it's built for campaigns and has a leveling up system. And personal goals. The more you do that type of stuff the more you get to upgrade your personal hand with better cards and tune your attack modifier deck.

I only played a non-campaign game, so the campaign bits weren't terribly relevant. But while I can see how they'd add something interesting for other players, they're not going to change my opinion of the game any. I've never enjoyed MMORPG or dungeon crawls where you're going out, fighting baddies, getting treasure and then upgrading so that you get better at doing the exact same thing over and over. Bumping me up levels and improving my stats and making me more powerful and throwing harder bad guys at me doesn't do anything to convince me that I'm doing anything different. I always feel like I'm stuck in a time loop being forced to repeat the same boring experiences over and over in these types of games. There's no sense of achievement or accomplishment for me.

The cardplay was something that I thought might be interesting in this game, but it didn't really stand out to me. It never seemed that difficult to choose which cards to play. I never had to struggle with painful choices. Sometimes the outcomes weren't great (mostly when the baddies flipped up their round modifier cards and unexpected things happened), but it was always fairly straightforward what needed to be done and what I needed to keep for later.

As I just mentioned, every round the bag guys flip a card which determines their initiative and changes their attack/move/special abilities for the round. Between that and the attack modifier decks, there was often a lot of unexpected changes from the time you selected your cards and when combat resolved. Which meant you just picked the best cards, hoped for the best and made do with how things turned out.

Overall, this isn't a game I'd particularly want to play. If someone really wanted to, I would, but I'd never request it. And honestly, there's nothing in this game that makes it stand out for me more than something like Castle Ravenloft. Yeah, I know there are differences, but those differences aren't important to me. They deliver the same experience for me. As for a campaign, I'd quickly tire of having to play this game more than once every couple of months. The idea of being tied into a weekly multi-year campaign is something that I'd just flat out refuse.

- The classes aren't the usual - there is no "tank", "healer", "spellcaster". Though there are classes that fit better with these archetypes, they arent't boxed in this. Brawlers like the Savvas can heal, attack melee and ranged, and can soak damage very well; for instance;
- The dual use of the cards. Is the heart of the game - each hero has an unique deck, and on each turn, two cards must be played. These will give the player her Initiative, and once is her turn, the player will have to activate the top half of a card and the bottom of other. This creates a great amount of possible interactions, not only between the two cards, but with the scenario (as some cards fare better in some positions of the character and of the enemies) and with the other characters (with the Initiative, and by creating elemental energies that other players can use). Also, the top can always be used to make a melee 2 attack, and the bottom to move 2 spaces; giving more malleability to the decision process;
- The exhausting mechanism. Once the player has gone through her deck (or sooner, but this isn't, usually, very good), she can rest. If she does a short rest, she loses one random card from the discard and get all the others, ready for the next turn. If she does a long rest, she loses one card she picks from the discard, activate the exhausted items, and is all she will do for the next turn. Therefore, the more a player burn through the cards, more are the chances that she will fall of exhaustion and won't be able to continue in the mission;
- The cards that can be used for powerful effects, but once used, will go out of the deck. This adds pressure to the character and player, since the cycle of cards will become even shorter, increasing the chances of the hero to fall;
- That cards can be taken out of the deck to prevent damage. Nice and effective both to avoid a luck hit to defeat a hero, and also to bring more tough choices;
- The city and road events. These are well written, often witty and gives a lot of mood to the setting;
- Scenarios are actually well written and are more than just bash monsters and collect loot. You will do these two things regardless, sure, but isn't the goal of many of the scenarios;
- Individual scenario goals are fun, and make players go out of their comfort zones;
- The way earning experience works (by use of cards). This is great, as it makes players think in the best way possible to milk the XP, while also having to deal with the threats of the scenario; 
- Perks that make your deck better and more unique;
- Campaign and class advancement. Nothing truly new, but I like these two;
- A whole lot of scenarios. And I mean, a lot.

[b]Dislike:[/b]
- The impossibility of giving or loaning gold to the others. This is, at the same time, dumb and anti-climactic. There is no real explanation that truly explains, thematically, why it works this way. Mechanically? Yes, yes, balance and such. I don't care. Almost all the other campaing driven, thematic dungeon crawlers were able to make money be of the group, or at least be allowed to give to others, if the person chooses. In Gloomhaven, no. Everyone is, apparently, pathologically attached to their money. You can go to adventures with these people, trust your life and limb to them; but hell to them if they even ask for some coin!;
- This brings to the next, and closely related issue: you can't pass/give items to the others. If the above is dumb, this is ridiculous and doesn't even make sense, let alone be anti-climactic. How is impossible to pass a potion to someone? In Gloomhaven, it is. If you find an item, that you think you can use, but later found that truly isn't for you, you can give it to someone. No, no. Get this: you need to sell it to the market, for half its price, then your companion can buy it from the market for the full price! Gloomhavenians do love their money (see above), but they hate their fellows even more, to the point that you can't even sell the item, for say, 75% of its price to your companion, with you gaining 25% more and she saving 25%. Apparently the merchant guild did something really awful to the mind of the people.

[b]Overall:[/b]
So far, a very nice game. Strong in decisions and in mood. Lots of things to do, to upgrade. Scenarios are well put together and the book of them is huge; there is also a load of side quests to be done (or not). Highly unique characters - each having their own way to face the problems and to earn experience.

A tremendous work from Isaac Childres - one that should take near a lifetime to make, but he made it seem easy. There are a number of features I have seen in other cooperative and thematic games, but the whole of Gloomhaven feels fresh, smart and fine-tuned. It is truly an amazing achievement.

RATING: 9.7
Very addictive tactical dungeon combat with HUGE amount of content.  I stopped worrying about scenario replayability once I realized I'm going to be spending 300+ hours to finish a first play.  0 major complaints on the dungeon gameplay, but I do wish the plot was more substantial and easier to follow.  Flipping through the scenarios makes it very easy to lose track of what few plot threads there are.  

Short form, buy this if you want a co-op tactical combat or dungeon crawler.  Do NOT buy this thinking it's an RPG substitute.

Played it solo, but looking forward to playing with others very soon. It's not a simple game but the basic choices and actions are well explained so after a couple of turns the game starts to flow nicely. The action deck for each character is really different and creates radically different options and gameplay. There are lots of interesting decisions to made and the monster deck forces players to stay on their toes. Looking forward to playing multiplayer soon.

Rating based on two playthroughs of the PnP version.

The decisions are real! Finally a dungeon crawl where you decide what you will do on your turn, not just hope that the dice will let you. I love the way you make a plan, then flip the card for the monsters, and maybe you need to do something different, depending on when your teammates will act, when the monsters will act and what they will do. And you can device a new plan. The choices are yours. But there is still excitement, despite not having dice. The combat card you draw when attacking or being attacked will mostly just modify your result, but sometimes it can mean the difference between life and death.

Overall a very rewarding and tactical experience, where your fate is mostly in your own hands, and not just the whim of Lady Fortuna. The different characters play differently and monsters get their own flavor. 

Can't wait to test this in a campaign setting. From my limited experience, this one comes highly recommended.

Pre-Ordered last November. Excruciating wait, but it was fun reading the comments here, and viewing the reviews and playthroughs menwhile. And of course, studying the Gloomhaven Rules in November, December, January, Feb.
I am just starting to play the game (Solo) and it has somehow lived up to my expectations.
While unboxing and unpacking, I admired all the work that went into laying out all those punch pieces on the many, many pieces of cardboard.
The manual is very good, also. While playing, it is remarkably easy to find  important details quickly.

The best co-op game i have tried to date.
The fact that combat is card driven and that your fellow adventures cannot tell you/advice you what to do, makes it far supirior to all the other dungeon crawlers i have tried.
Normally the most brainy person at the table takes control of other players actions, but  in this game that is not possible.
The slow grind of gaining levels and completing quests is also really well done.
Road cards and city cards generating random events based upon your choices adds a lot to the game too :-)

Hands down the best board game I've played. Everything I wanted in a tabletop rpg with it's progressive leveling system, event cards, and a slowly unfolding campaign. More than anything, the way that this game uses cards to somehow represent both your attacks, movement, and health is astounding, and manages to create a game that really makes you think before you move, only to watch you teammates completely ruin your entire game plan. Overall, despite its high price point, gloomhaven is a game I would recommend any hardcore board gamer if they can find the time for this monster of a game.

RATING: 10
It's like Isaac looked into my head, asked himself "Hm, what would this guy like?", and then designed Gloomhaven based on that. I've played it over 60 times in 5 weeks and am still totally addicted. In fact, I can't wait re-starting the campaign with different characters and different choices. Thankfully, my wife is just as enthusiastic as I am.

I love the core hand management mechanic, the optimization it requires. Characters and monsters vary greatly, there is always room for tweaking, improving, optimizing. The campaign is also great, but make no mistake: The game is 90% tactical combat. 

There are some downsides, though:
- Setup is *very* long, even with a good storage solution.
- Scenario variety could be better. There are some great, creative ones; I just wish there were more of them and less of "Kill all enemies". 
- Some characters are more suitable for 4 players than for 2. 

But even if there is still improvement for the expansion, this is still the most brilliant and addictive boardgame I have ever played.

Holy wow this game is amazing.  As of this comment, I have played only two scenarios of the campaign but I'm incredibly and deeply in love with the nuanced mechanics.  One of my friends said, "I mean no offense, but this isn't a board game.  This is an RPG that happens to be so well-put together that a GM isn't necessary."

I don't entirely agree with him, but it does feel like a hybrid between a board game and an RPG.  I've had so much fun with this game and I'm super excited to see what else is in store.

This is the game I've been waiting for since I started playing board games many years ago. It's everything I wanted in a campaign/legacy adventure. Exciting tactical combat, rewarding character progression, great variety in play-styles, and it's just so much fun to play. 
If I could nit pick anything, it would be the fact that set-up can be a chore due to the insane number of components (I highly recommend Plano boxes or similar sorting trays). But it's this wide variety of enemies, overlays, traps, tokens, etc. that keep things fresh, so it's worth the extra few minutes needed to set each scenario up and I wouldn't change a thing.
So for anyone looking to grab a copy when the inevitable reprinting begins, I don't think there's a better bang for your buck in the board game world at the moment. I can not recommend enough.

At first glance, Gloomhaven looks like another guys-on-a-grid combat game, but look deeper! The tactical combat is a fantastic balance of strategy and desperation, in which you choose to combine two actions from a constantly dwindling pool of cards. And this is a legacy game, so the characters that you level up and learn to love will someday choose to retire, forcing you to unlock and learn a whole new class.

VERY addictive game. This is a campaign game done right. Legacy aspects are light but necessary (it's mostly adding stuff a-bit-at-a-time: locations, items, monsters, characters)

[+] want to play more! game balance is truly amazing, most of the time it seems unbarable at first and win by a very thin margin; gameplay is very tactical, every card play must be thought hard; excellent SOLO probably will never play in any other way (too long); very cool/unique/different classes
[-] first game can be overwhelming!, So many bits, setup/teardown/storage is painful! a lot of time spent between scenarii (leveling up, items, unlocking stuff) but it's still fun!

This game has replaced all of my other dungeon crawl / scenario or campaign type games. I still enjoy games like Citadels and Betrayal for party games, but this game is by far the best campaign game I have ever played. The mechanics are much more streamlined and easier to follow than most campaign games, but also much more intricate and strategy driven. Particularly as a result of the luck mitigation through no dice chucking (the cards are much less swingy).

Something like Descent 2nd edition, or Imperial Assault only lasts around 10 or so scenarios, but this goes on for 100+ scenarios and has legacy mechanics that drive the just one more game mindset. Very fun to play, and my gaming group only wants to play this anymore, which I am always down for. I love the loot, monster, and scenario variation as well. Some scenarios are very unique, giving a feeling of difference on various scenarios. All around, an awesome game. Well done Isaac!

I've seen this game called a, "GM-less D&D campaign", a "dungeon crawler" and a "Euro puzzle". I don't think any of these is really accurate, even if it has some elements of all of them.

Instead I propose that the closest analog would Japanese strategy RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Yes there is a story (and a fun one too) and yes your characters level up and gain new gear, but at its core this is a tactical combat game. And a great one at that. The card play allows for tons of possibilities without making things too AP-heavy and there's a real need to exploit the synergies of your party to win. Characters playing totally differently is nice as well. The scenario design is for the most part excellent and offers a great variety of combat challenges.

I'm not usually a fan of "legacy" games but I love this one because rather than taking ages to unlock rules or stuff like that, you're just thrown straight into the full game and unlock additional scenarios, classes and items as you go.

Oh wow, this game is HUGE! There is so much good stuff to unveil, it makes me giddy with excitement.

Played it twice. Maybe the hype kept the bar high but it was a letdown when I finally got to play it. 

Rules are confusing, and gameplay feels tedious due to micromanagement of player hands and decks. too many ways to remove a card for the rest of the game and feel crippled.

Also leveling up just felt too slow and incremental. So in 3 games I get a tiny permanent bonus which can be very situational (ignore scenario effects)? ehh.. so many better co-ops out there despite the fun choose your own adventure format.

A very solid dungeon crawler with an interesting campaign and clever deck management, this is also a real labor of love, and it shows.

I'm very surprised I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would - so I actually sold off this amazingly produced game soon after I got it. Why? Well it is just too big of a box to keep around if I neither can't or won't play it more fairly regularly. 

I really wanted to love this game, being such a nerd that I am. A dungeon crawl game without roll and resolve was a thing (and might still be THE thing) I was really craving for. But in the end I might realize that this whole genre is just not for me. 

Its hard to put my finger on exactly what fell flat for me, but it just feels too slow and fiddly and I can't stand the feeling you get when you draw the wrong 'combat card' at the exactly wrong moment.

I recognize it is a very well produced game with a lot of clever mechanics, but just not for me unfortunately.

This game is superb - and is easily one of the best games I've ever played. The card play and hand management(core game play component) remind me of the best parts of Mage Knight, but in a more streamlined and less stressful way. The game flows smoothly, everything is intuitive, and even though the rule book is large - it was well written and an easy read (how all rule books should be). What most dungeon crawl games lack is proper narrative- all the stories I've read so far are interesting and well written, and I look forward to unraveling the overall story arc as well as each subplot. Like the designers of Sword & Sorcery - Isaac paid attention to what works and what doesn't in dungeon crawl games (and why not borrow from tried and true video games?). Besides the initial punching out and organizing of all the components (2+hrs), I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this game.
Anyone complaining about "fiddly" moving parts or the "difficult" to reference rule book should stick to Micky Mouse Love Letter.

Love this game.  The hand management and selecting top or bottom actions make for interesting decisions.  The scenarios are long.  I played this game over 200 hours and unlocked all characters.  Unfortunately I think I am burned out from playing so much.  I do not think it is one I will play with my kids due to the demons in the game.  My wife is adamant against about playing games with demons.  Happy wife happy home as they say.  Game has been sold to supplement purchasing Too Many Bones.  -Should this game be a 10 if I sold it?  I did for all intents and purposes finish the campaign.  I think if people rate Pandemic Legacy a 10 but do not ever play again then this should be the same for this game.

Great game, I have a few minor complaints about how tedious it is to set up and pack the box. There exist custom storage methods that would make this a lot more pleasant, though this is not included in the box. All in all the best dungeon crawler I have ever played. I'd like to unlock stuff (characters) slightly faster and it gets a bit repetitive after 20-30 scenario's, but let's be honest if you played it that much already it's more than worth it!

There is nothing really wrong with this. It just doesn't do anything interesting to make it stand out from any other move and attack scenario games. Much prefer Arkham Horror The Card Game which is quicker, easier, more interesting mechanically, and keeps the story closer to the action.

RATING: 7
It's a lot of stuff. Not sold on all the terrain and room pieces, since they're all so functionally similar. And of course it's a great big sprawling mess on the table.

Played through two scenarios so far. More luck than the "euro" tag would indicate; the Null and 2x modifiers can play a huge role. I'm unsure if I'll keep using them in RAW format. I enjoy the core card play mechanisms, but it's wound so tightly that it makes the heavy luck intrusion very jarring at times. It needs to be non-deterministic, sure, but this goes too far.

Biggest fear at this point is that it's really a grind at heart. Character progression is very slow, which exacerbates that. Certainly doesn't hold a candle to Mage Knight, but for something different, a campaign or two will hopefully be worth the time spent.

Spent all day playing with old friends to see what all the fuss is about. Completed two scenarios over the weekend, interestingly with Cragheart instead of Brute in our otherwise similarly standard party to what everyone else says they use. All I discovered was a few funky mechanics wrapped in an excessive amount of blandly decorated cardboard. Felt uninspired by its generic setting -Not my fantasy campaign game of choice. Need more elves & pirates.

If you combined together the best card mechanics from Gloomhaven and Mage Knight, supplied one hundred properly sculpted miniatures and presented the campaign set in an engaging non-generic universe then I’d be inclined to feel engaged in the game experience. Gloomhaven is a generously sized package filled with surprises which included a lack of attention to detail in two fundamental areas; 1. Quality miniature sculpting 2. Forgetting to bring talented fantasy artists in to illustrate all its blank cards and other mundane components.
Gloomhaven is even more plain than its unimaginative title suggests. I’d always prefer to be adventuring in somewhere drenched in tomes of arcane lore that mattered. Somewhere like Mordheim.

Epic co-op fantasy skirmish modular grid movement dungeon crawl. Card driven simultaneous selection and no dice!--The Heck you say. The most interesting play comes from the player hand management of the hero action decks where you pair two action cards and perform the basic (or super) top action of one card with the lower action of the other. Deep level of tactics and rich variety of content for fresh replay. Uses the advantage system like that of D&D 5.0. Love the scalable difficulty of encounters. Fun combat modifier cards supplemented with blessings (or curses). Love the elegant rest and bleed system from expending your action cards. I like the tactical uncertainty during combat from not knowing precisely what cards your fellow heroes will play with the built in initiative system to resolve order of hero actions. Clever hero leveling system with a deck builder (thinning) aspect. The campaign has a legacy choose your own adventure path aspect as parts of world map are revealed based on the decisions of the heroes. I wish there were a better way to track wounds and effect chits than lying them next to the minis on the map. So fiddly but I can't think of a better alternative. Maybe lay them on the creature modifier cards?

I'm an old school paper and pencil RPG'er but this is the one I'd buy if I weren't.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Don't be daunted by the price (granted it's supposed to retail at $140). This game destroys all other games hands down. The sheer amount of stuff that you get in the box is impressive to the point it's almost ridiculous and it weighs nearly 30 lbs. Fair warning though that it will take you about 2 hours to fully learn the game, not to mention the time to fully get prepared to play your first game from punching out all the assorted enemy standees, tokens and map tiles. Basically don't buy this and expect to open it and be playing within a few minutes.

Once you get the rules down pat and have everything sorted and ready to go it is sooooo much fun. You can play the game solo or with a group of up to 4. You start out in the town of Gloomhaven and must take on quests to proceed in the massive story the game book provides. Along the way there are optional side quests you can partake in to get more loot and experience. After each quest whether you succeed or fail, you travel back to town where you can visit the shop to spend your hard earned gold on new equipment and gear, level up your character that you are playing from the experience you gained from the quests, donate to the local church (which gives a benefit) , start a new character AND/OR take part in city events.

The town itself has a prosperity level that is raised as you do specific quests. It starts at level 1 and every time it gains a new level more different items get added to the town shop to pick through for purchase. The city events are randomized and they supply an interesting story of something happening in the city that allows you and your group to make a choice on how you want to proceed with the event. The choice you make determines whether something good, bad or neutral happens to your group.

This game is LONG. It takes on average 2 hours to complete one quest and there are 98 different quests in the quest book. Mind you that 2 hours is generous, for my group it typically takes about 3 hours per quest as we have much more discussion as we are delving into dungeons. As such the game is made for new people to easily join and drop from playing throughout the game if someone decides they don't want to play anymore. Also there are 6 characters to choose from starting out so if someone doesn't like the character they picked right off the bat, then they can easily switch to a different character once they get back to town.

Once you finally get done partaking in the city life you draw a random road event quest card to complete. These basically act just like the city event cards I detailed earlier but with story elements more directed to life on the road. Once that is finished, you start the quest you were traveling to. You open up the quest book and find the current quest and start the setup process. Each quest has a completely different setup and they are all played on modular pieces that make up the game board. Each piece will snap together to form the current dungeon or area and there are doors throughout usually that separate the individual rooms. One of the cool things is, your group doesn't know what lies in wait on the other side of each door until one of you opens it. Then whoever is running the quest book sets up the next room for the party. Also the quest book has very thematic story elements you read as you start the quest and when you open each new door to really set the mood.

There is always a specific quest goal that you must complete to beat each quest run, at which point you and your group will gain any number of items. It could be gold, experience, new locations to explore, new gear to be added to the market. All kinds of cool stuff not to mention your progression in the very awesome story. If you lose the quest, you are transported back to town to recover. The good news? You get to keep all the gold and experience you gained from the quest so you don't leave empty handed and feel like you wasted your time. However if you want to proceed in the story and open new locations/quests you must buck up and beat the quest at hand. If the game feels too hard you can easily lower the difficulty of the enemies but be warned that this also lowers the bonus experience and amount of gold you collect from enemies. I would suggest for first time players to play the first couple of quests at the lowest difficulty until you have a good grasp of the play mechanics and rules. Then after that have at it!

As far as progression of the game goes, as you defeat locations and quests you will unlock new locations and more quests to take part in. There is another game board that acts as a map of gloomhaven (the town) and its surrounding land. On this gameboard you will keep track of all the locations you have unlocked and beaten via stickers that are included with the game. When you beat a location you check a little box on the sticker with a marker or pen to show you have completed it. And when you unlock a new location you find that location sticker and place it on the gameboard in its specific spot. This is also where you keep track of the towns prosperity level and any global achievements that you have completed. Global achievements are specific things that you and your team have completed during the life of the game and have an effect on the overall story and determine other quests that can be done. There are also party achievements that act in a similar fashion but to a lesser extent.

As I said earlier there are 6 characters/classes that you can choose from at the start. When you start the game you randomly choose a character quest card as well. This card has some specific thing you need to complete in the game to unlock it's benefits, such as discovering a new character/class. Because of this there are numerous other characters/classes included with the game that unlock for players as the game progresses. Each character comes with its own mini as well AND each one is in its own little tuckbox so you cannot see what it is. This adds so much excitement to the game. You CRAVE the play just so you can get to the point of opening up the new box and see what's inside. On that point there are numerous other envelopes that are sealed from the onset of the game and are not opened until you completed specific objectives.

As far as value goes, the time played to cost ratio is outstanding. At 2-3 hours per quest for 98 quests (plus more online) it will take MONTHS before your group finally beats the game (story). Even longer if you do every single side quest depending on how often you play. Heck, even once you beat the game there is nothing stopping a group from just picking any quest in the quest book and going back and replaying it just for the fun of it. Granted there wont be much point for the gold or story elements as you already traveled that road but for the gameplay it would be worth it. Speaking of gameplay, battling beasts and other critters in the game is very unique. Each character has a specific amount of ability cards in hand each dungeon run. It's different for each character but as an example let's say there are 13.....for each of your turns you play 2 of the cards. Each card has a top and bottom ability that you can use. On the 2 cards you play you pick 1 top and 1 bottom ability to be used, whether it's movement, setting traps, healing, casting spells or just attacking plus more. After you use the cards they either get discarded or "lost". Cards generally get lost if they have a decently powerful ability so you can only use it once during a quest and they go in a specific pile next to your character board. The discarded cards go in a diff pile and you can choose a "rest" action to collect those back but lose one to the lost pile.

Basically as you traverse the dungeon, you will get more and more tired and if you ever "lose" all your ability cards and cant rest to get some back, you then become exhausted and have to head back to town, leaving the rest of the party to contend on their own. This creates a very strategic playstyle in where you only use your powerful "lost" cards sparingly when you absolutely need them. I love it. Another cool mechanic that I think alot of people miss when they play is that when an enemy attacks you for enough damage to kill you, you can choose to "lose" any one of your ability cards in your hand to prevent all that damage.

TLDR: This is a game that will keep you occupied for months, possibly years. The sheer amount of content and interesting story creates enough value to keep a group intrigued and wanting to come back for more. Whether played solo or with a group, you will not be disappointed.

The moment I backed the 2nd edition on KS I regretted it, but (spoiler alert) it turned out not to be the huge mistake that I predicted. I bought it to play 2p with my son, and he loves it. I also think it's pretty fun.

[i]Warning:[/i] Before playing, I put in an 8-hour workday to punch everything out, sort counters into plano boxes (x2) and counter trays (x2), read the rulebook, research and select starting characters, flip through the rulebook a second time, scan the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1897763/official-faq-game-revs-1-and-2]FAQ[/url], set up a practice game, and wonder whether I should purchase the removable sticker set.

I expected the 51-page rulebook to be a disaster, but the 2nd printing smoothed over most of the rough edges. We're playing almost 100% correctly at this point, though reading [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1727703/easy-miss-rules]this list[/url] of easily missed rules certainly helped.

Some major caveats:

- The game is permanently set up on a basement table. If I had to box/unbox the entire game every time - or haul the game to a friend's house - there's no way that I would continue the campaign. It would be sold/traded/burned under those conditions.

- Even in perma-table mode, setup and teardown isn't entirely trivial. But it's obvious that Gloomhaven should be prescheduled and set up before the other players arrive. And really, the setup isn't that much more time intensive than any other cardboard-heavy adventure - again, assuming that you don't have to unbox the game from scratch.

- As with most dungeon crawlers, more players simply adds more time. Two players is perfect, as games are short (60-90 minutes) and you don't have to worry about corralling multiple players every week. We actually won scenario #2 in 10 minutes because we got lucky with a x2 attack modifier and two-shotted the scenario boss.

- We took others' advice and played on Easy mode until we leveled up.

By the way, I really like that XP are tied to thematic character actions (e.g., backstabbing or disarming for the Scoundrel), not simply monster kills. That's pretty clever, as are many other things about the game.

But yeah, I expected to hate Gloomhaven. It just didn't turn out that way.

I have never played any boardgame as much as I have played Gloomhaven. And I'm still enjoying it, and are looking forward to each new session.

I could nitpick, talk about the setup time, the cleanup time, fidgety counters and such, but I can't really see how you could keep the game as it is, without these parts, so it doesn't affect my score.

Gloomhaven is a game system, and a very successful one. Innovative and grand. Innovation doesn't always equal fun gameplay though. The whole thing is a fiddly procedure to set up and to play, and once the awe over how well thought out the SYSTEM is, the exhaustion sets in. Some would say the cardplay creates intense and interesting decisions, i feel that it is needlessly hard, clunky and brain burning. I WILL buy this again if a companion app is released, the SYSTEM is solid, the gameplay experience however for me was not.

Gloomhaven is everything I wish Mage Knight would have been, without any of the needlessly complex and fiddly combat sequences.  Despite my desire to min/max as in Mage Knight, AP is surprisingly absent as everything plays silky smooth and is a pleasure.  But be warned, setup and organization in general is a nightmare.  If you can stay on top of this, you will be well rewarded for your efforts.

This game strokes the Ameritash and Euro lover at both ends and is a top notch, fine dining, board game experience.  Dare I say, game of the year... in January?   Bravo, Isaac.  Bravo.

For now, I only see one major drawback: there is too many components and nothing to store them directly in the box, it's the first game ever for which I had to buy plastic bags to store components and it's not perfect at all.

2nd Edition - Kickstarted!

RATING: 9
Great dungeon crawler with loads of scenarios. The action selection mechanism is excellent -- cards have a top action and bottom action, you play two cards but can only use the top of one and the bottom of the other. I'm torn on the combat modifier decks -- an unlucky card draw can doom the scenario just as much as a lucky card draw can let you breeze to victory. But that's where the campaign part of Gloomhaven comes in -- you can improve your attack modifier deck through perks gained by achieving battle goals or leveling up. And that's awesome. Play a few scenarios, gain some gold and XP, and return to Gloomhaven to teach your character some new tricks.

As a battle-scarred boardgame veteran who only touches the most tactically challenging games I can say this is the best boardgame I've played. Big thanks to Isaac Childres and the team for making this game. I would gladly be kickstarting a sequel if it was ever made. Some things that can still be improved: 
-Monster skill decks should evolve for high level monsters so that not only their hp increases but also the way they act in the field.
-Better AI rules for monsters. It doesn't hurt to make it more complicated. Hey come on, we're all +5 here aren't we? Conditional cards on monster decks could make it more challenging. Also, monsters could collectively change their behavior during battle based on Boss monster commands or other triggers on the field,  e.g. if(attack_mode_on) {Move(); Attack();} else if(heal_mode_on) {Retreat(); Heal();}. Sometimes monsters ruin their good start by spending many turns doing essentially nothing.
-Campaign could be deeper. There's a huge potential in teaming up with fantasy writers and implementing the game in the Gloomhaven format.

For the record, I have way more than 3 plays ^_^ I easily logged more than 30 hours playing my friends' copy. But I never got to see the end game and I'm ready to jump in, to show another set of folks what they've been missing. This is truly a "gamer's game."

This is an incredible game with a wonderfully split personality. It has incredible and rewarding RPG elements but focuses on an intense and mentally taxing puzzle-like combat system. Combat never gets out of control or too unwieldly because of it.

Amazing fantasy adventure that takes a lot of cues from computer RPGs and D&D. Really enjoying the card play, planning and sequencing. The growth of characters is really compelling also. It can be a bit of a grind but I like the challenge and the system allows you to come away from each attempt with whatever gold and XP you have amassed so it never feels like time wasted.

I'm 24 plays in and I can say this was exactly what I was expecting and suits me perfectly. I love the way the story branches out and the choices you make close off some paths (although I really want to go back and make different choices on another go to see what those paths have in store). I'm really excited to see how the story progresses forward!!

The time investment is HUGE, and the payoff small.
Hours of unthematic grinding in the smallest dungeons conceivable, result in you (maybe) getting to swap in a new card. Woop!

Still very early in the game with just the original characters so my score is bound to change. Doesn't seem much like a Legacy game so far.  More of a campaign style. Not one of my favorite genres of games, but seems to have promise but also will be very repetitive if it continues like this.

Best tactical dungeon crawler I've ever played, with huge progression, character/party advancement mechanics in a campaign driven world.  It's exactly the game I was looking for that didn't require someone to act as the game master, but offers a challenging experience and with the card hand mechanics, prevents alpha gaming.

Dungeon crawl with role playing elements.  This game is meant for four players through and through.  I've only played one scenario so far as we are trying to play with the same players each time, but wow.  It is extremely challenging, and you have to learn to work as a team and to your character's particular strengths if you want to win.  There's a ton of playable characters (18 in total if you can unlock them all), and the mechanics are unlike any other game I've played thus far.  Just like an old school RPG, there's a main town for you to buy supplies/equipment or get quests.  I'll update once we've played a few more scenarios, but this one's a winner in my books.

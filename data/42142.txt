This is my first time playing an RPG ever, so take with a pinch of salt!

The instructions were mostly great, but confusing or unclear sometimes. I tried to learn as I played but I made many mistakes the first few turns. Reading the rules a few times helped, to understand how things were meant to progress.

I didn't manage to finish an adventure in 30 mins, it would've taken at least twice that for a first attempt. I think with experience it could be 30-45 mins. The excellent snippets of action tickled my inner Whovian and left me wanting more.

There's a lot of jumping between books right from the start, and reference tables or action lists everywhere, so print is better than playing on-screen for quick reference. As a newbie I wrote down all the para #s on my character sheet so if I got lost in a rabbit hole of sub-references and rules I could always come back to where the action was happening.

Wouldn't recommend for unmotivated newbies, but I'm willing to persevere. The plots and characters look worth it!

Printed and bound the PDFs (including all classic adventures) about a year ago with the intent to play, but was overwhelmed by all of the material.  Six months ago, I watched some play-through videos (they make it look so easy!), but still fumbled when I tried to play.  Just now I was finally able to manage the game (after watching the videos again and studying a reference sheet).  

There is a bit of shuffling the different books around, but the game is such a wild ride, it is worth it.  Truthfully, I don't know if I would even call it a game, but rather your own personal episode.  I have played three times now and every time something happens that is so much like the show, I laugh out loud.  
"King Philip becomes the Doctor's ally and we go to a great feast only to find out that King Philip is actually under the mind control of the Carrionites!  And in the battle to oppose, the good high-priest who the Doctor convinced to help us perishes at the hand of the enemy!"  

How did Simon make this stuff???

Totally worth the learning curve.

Enjoying this enormously, and with the sheer amount of content and replayability I think this'll become one of my 'regulars'. It really captures the Whovian feel, and though its mechanic is based on two other great solo games, it eclipses them both. Kudos to Simon for his sterling work!

With the [geekurl=/thread/924855/the-doctor-who-solitaire-story-game-online]Doctor Who online Wiki[/geekurl] it is possible to play this solitaire adventure game online and very comfortable. Before the online Wiki it was necessary to print some heavy PDF documents.

This is an interesting solitaire game to pass some time.  Enemies are unique, and strategies have to be developed on how to beat them, otherwise your lifespan will be short.

The sheer weight of the materials and the extraordinary effort that the author has put into this project has compelled me to increase my rating. Also, it really is a good game! With continued effort and a playable wiki the game deserves an even higher rating!-but having tried it a couple more times I simply do not like it.

My one game of this so far felt very random to me. I was reading out the text and following the instructions (as the gamer geek) and my  girlfriend was making the choices and rolling the dice (as the Dr Who fan). Her decisions didn't seem to have that much impact upon the success or failure of her episode. By the fiat of the dice, her Doctor turned up in Neo Rome, befriended a legionary, met some Ice Pirates, and was thrown in prison; when she finally broke free, her group was set upon by the bad guys (the Slitheen) and were all killed; except the Doctor, who apparently died but then regenerated, so escaped. Nothing she chose to do affected that outcome at any point. A shame, because the setting and scenarios are richly thematic, and the author's clearly gone to an awful lot of work with it. (I've since removed my fairly low rating because it's unfair on him for the obvious effort and care he's put into his design.)

The Solitaire Game is a fun and exciting way of playing adventures in the world of Doctor Who - the feel and style, the glamourous companions and the hideous monsters - all are there and it's a great game to play! Certainly better than the official game as well - this and Siskoid's Doctor Who Card Game are living proof that fans really know what doesn't and doesn't work in the world of Doctor Who!

I started reading choose your own adventure books when “The Cave of Time” first came out in 1979.
This game is the best of its sort I have ever seen! I didn’t know what to expect when I started, and there is a learning curve to get over, (working on making that easier) but I did not expect such a lovely little story, complete with a romantic interlude! I had a wonderful vacation, got the girl, & outwitted the monsters without resorting to violence. Awesome!! 10 stars & a new fan & advocate. 
Simon, I salute you. (Appropriately emotional Murray Gold music here)

Reading the game I was highly intrigued. I've always been a fan of Dr. Who and have hoped to find an RPG style game that really captured the flavor of the series. Reading through the rules, I was a bit daunted with playing it and it seemed like there wasn't a lot of "meat" to the game. However, I'm happy to admit I was wrong. The game is extraordinary for setting up the framework of the adventure, giving important choices, and getting out of the way so that the player can fill in the details. A truly amazing game that is obviously a labor of love and brimming with expansions and new adventures! I would recommend this game to Dr. Who fans especially, but also to anyone that likes the "paragraph" or "choose your own adventure" style of game.

As the designer, I'm obviously a bit biased, but I genuinely feel that I've done  a fairly good job of getting both a good game and recreating the feel of 'Doctor Who'.

The game is constantly being developed, revised and expanded - mainly due to feedback that people here have given me.

Thanks to everyone that has taken the time to post session reports, ask questions, rate the game, give comments, and become fans.

I'll keep doing more until people tell me not to!

Update: I'm getting closer to my ideal game...

I've never rated a game before. Usually the great games I know about are already quite popular, so rating or saying something has so little real value. 

In this case, i think it could matter. More people REALLY need to know about this great game! 

I was really amazed and impressed with the Dr Who solo adventure game. Think Agents of Smersh/Tales of the Arabian Nights meets Dro Who on STEROIDS and you get an inkling of what your in for! 

The game is amazingly deep, thematic, and the most rich and narrative crafted games i've ever seen! It's faithful to the source, fun and best of all free! I love free, who doesn't, but I can't help but feel a little guilty. The quality of this effort, its really a shame the developer doesnt get rewarded for their outstanding efforts. I would have easily pay $50 for this game, its worth it! Instead my local Kinkos will get most of that money,  printing out the manuals in glossy high quality binders for my anticapted future play. 

BTW, a testimate to how much this game resonanated with me, I would pay double that to play this on my computer/IPAD! The complexity of tracking available game choices and the story generator automated on a IPAD, with nice screens, leaves players with pure gaming bliss! Crosses fingers someone ports this to PC/IPAD  

I hope the developer makes more games of this calibre, and hope to see them for sell or at least on kickstarter :) Someone crafting this quality of work should be paid for it, it's a travisty otherwise!

So far the only downsides to the game...  
Tracking what your valid choices are during play (surely this is easier to track as your become a vet, but a bit daunting as a new player)
Game could benifit from a flow chart (especially when you factor in the optional rules)
and of course the severe loss of your spare time!

I worked through the example of play and then started my first 2 adventures. Absolutely brilliant game, very much like the old Barbarian Prince, but only much better and more thematic. Amazing narrative potential and certainly real challenge. There is certainly an element of going-on-a-ride, where you roll dice and see where the game takes you and there is a strong element of luck also, but there are some real choices to be made that isn't obvious at first sight. You really need to study the paragraphs to maximize your chances and surprising there is often more then one valid choice available to you. The game is paced very well, 12 turns is just perfect, not too long and not too short. I love how the tension builds up and it gets quite action pack towards the end just like a TV show.

I ended up printing all the character, equipment and ally cards, I have these placed on my small white board and I make notes around the cards with a dry-erase marker. I also have printed out the player aid with the turn, defeat and luck tracks and used a few cubes mark my progress. I printed and laminated the other player aid with the action tables which meant less flipping through the rule book.

I can see that its going to take many many games before I exhaust even the base set before trying the expansions. Great value.

My first two games is this ended up as failures, in the first game against clones, I kept getting no encounters and no results for my actions, so didn't make any progress. I think I didn't take advantage of the traits my doctor had. I did better in the second game against the werewolf. There was less of them for one thing and I manage to get enough defeat points to oppose them, I almost defeated it, but had 2 horrible "history" rolls (Used luck once: need to clarify: am I correct in thinking that you can only use LUCK once per roll? Correct?), that lead to a fight from which the doctor escaped leaving his lovely companion to die horribly. Had one more chance on the final turn to trap the wolf, but also made a horrible "history" roll, but managed to escape to regenerate to fight another day.

Just so you know: I know very little able Dr. Who, never saw the new series and just a few episodes of the old about 25 years ago. I know the synopsis and that's all. So this is no fanboy rave.

Highly recommended.

Not a half bad solitaire game.  Takes a while to get used to the rules, and you will need plenty of time to make it through 1 play, but it's the best storytelling style solitaire game out there (possibly the only good one).  The only other games that come close to it are Arkham Horror and Tales of Arabian Nights, but those games are only fun in groups.

This is the game that asks "Can you do better than the Doctor?" The answer, at least in my case, is "not bloody likely!"

I am very impressed with the amount of work Simon has put in here. It's not just the mechanics and text that seem almost professionally produced, but  layout, proofreading, and editing are also quite good. Simon has obviously taken a lot of time and care making this game -- and it shows! Truly a labour of love!

There's lots of dice rolling, but that's to be expected with this sort of story generating game. Otherwise, replayability would suffer greatly.

Very interesting for a Doctor Who fan, like myself. Most all of the Doctor's former enemies are here, as well as a few new twists to spice things up.

Lots of room for expansion with this one.

My own personal opinion is that with a bit of polish, this could easily be published as a licensed product -- sort of a Doctor Who meets Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Thank you so much, Simon, for making this available to all of us!

I was very happy to see another Dr. Who game on BGG.  Knowing that it was self-made and would undoubtably receive the attention to detail only offered by a Dr. Who fan made it even more appealing.  The continued supplement development with different incarnations of the Doctor and 'modules', expanding the locations, events and villains are something I really appreciate in games like this.  The nature of the game combined with the dice mechanic make re-playability high as it is highly unlikely any two adventures will be alike.  This game will be of high interest to those who came from the 'Barbarian Prince' days as the mechanic and setup is quite similar.  Also, too, RPG fans will enjoy this as there is an amount of story-telling that could be involved when writing a session report.  For those who play the FASA Dr. Who RPG, this would be a fantastic way for GM's to come up with a 'rough' for module ideas.  I rated the game a 9 and not a 10 only because I think that the rules could be stream-lined a bit.  They are laid out in a fairly logically way and there are complied and concise tables laid out in the appendix, but a flowchart of some sort could be devised to streamline the experience.  I noticed that there are a few fan-made files but have yet to check them out.  All in all, an excellent pnp game and I highly recommend it to Dr. Who and RPG fans.

Compared to the Sherlock Holmes spinoff, the Doctor Who Solitaire Story Game has clearer but not flawless rules, and the gameplay appears to offer a little more choice here and there. The flavour also seems better suited to the format, although make no mistake: you are still mostly just rolling, and I didn't relish the idea of combat or group splitting. I was eaten by the Racnoss in my second adventure, who's going to save the universe now?

The game is certainly entertaining and has its moments.

However, it is difficult to maintain the immersion of being the Doctor because there is a discontinuity within the adventures themselves that work against this immersion.  I find myself constantly fighting it.

Because of this, I tend to get roughly shaken out of "being the Doctor" and thrust into the reality of someone rolling dice, reading paragraphs, and trying to mentally fill in the story between paragraphs.

This game does an amazing job of creating and maintaining a coherent, surprising, and suspenseful storyline that feels absolutely true to the Doctor Who universe. At the end of my first adventure, which took about an hour, I sat back and with my best David Tennant grin (which on me probably looks pretty idiotic) gushed "Aw, now that’s just BRILLIANT!" Thanks, Simon, for crafting such a polished and engaging game.

10!  That was a joyful input.  First, game rating, and a marvelous achievement to have done this.  DWSG is a crazy accomplishment, for it is a solitary role playing game that works and works extremely well.  Did I mention you get to play a Time Lord?  Well, you do, and a Time Lord's playing field is all time and space, so the claim can be boasted that DWSG has infinite replay ability and narrative possibility.  That is a deep well for a game to draw from, and for the true fanatic is a game that can be played from now till one rests still and cold.  That the game is FREE is the part that blows my reality filters.  FREE!  Free and loyal to the lovely subject material.  I often stand in amazement at how creative and word gifted role play world designers are.  The amount of work, for a dream most will never see.  What passion drives such a vision?  DWSG is driven by a passionate muse indeed, and I am the happier for it.  Is the game easy?  Not at first.  Is it perfect?  Nothing is, but the game is in a constant state of refinement.  Someday, and the game has infinity on its side it may indeed be perfect.

Initial Impressions: This game definitely feels like a choose your adventure book feel to it, and the way the booklets are laid out makes me think that each play will probably be able to establish its own narrative, rather than feeling just like a almalgamation of random events. That being said, I wish there was much  more direction once you encounter the enemy. It appears you generally want to first discover the enemy's goal and then collect DM to be able to oppose the enemy. However, the actions that allow you to do so may instead take you down a long rabbit hole of events that have no tie ins whatsoever to the main enemy (I think this gets less likely as the game progresses, but is still annoying). Also, during my play through there were times that I got stuck not really sure what I was supposed to do next because the rules didn't really seem to hint on how to advance my objective (e.g., I didn't realize after the opposing the enemy I needed to once again encounter them to trigger their defeat), but I assume this would go away with future plays.

Furthermore, I am not a fan of the combat. Now it seems like combat is only a last resort option in this game, but I still want it to be a good experience in the rare times I would encounter it. Depending on the enemies it seems like it can drag out quite a bit at least for the lack of excitement it invokes, and I think between evenly matched teams whoever gets the first hit off has a huge advantage.

Finally, there were some encounters that were really vague on the ramifications, and while understandable that there would be some errors in such a wordy game, it definitely left me unsure of how to proceed.

[microbadge=5389][microbadge=11798][microbadge=6700]

A ridiculously solid and playable solo game.  The initial reaction to pages upon pages of grids and random-looking alpha-numerical codes may seem intimidating at first, but after some simple decoding with the aid of a well written rule book, the game play really begins to shine.  The actual stories that are formed are impressively coherent, and the game progression just gets better.

If there was a major flaw in the game, it would have to be a Doctor Who criticism and not a design criticism: the major reliance on the Russel T Davies era of the show.  There are expansions for Doctors of the classic series (which I overwhelmingly recommend, as they are just as well written and have a great deal of exciting material), but ultimately, the bulk of the game, even with classic expansions, gets its mood and details from the Ninth and Tenth Doctors' eras.  I would have liked a game that was designed from the ground up with the classic Doctors, and then have expansions with the newer Doctors like the Unauthorized Dr. Who CCG, but this is a minor quibble.  The game is very good, for what it is.

I actually watched the first episode of Doctor Who 2005 because I was already printing this game (never played a game like that so I wanted to try, and this one seemed the most interesting) and I planned to be playing Doctor Who: Solitaire Story Game regardless of my feelings towards the TV series. Then I fell in love with the show and watched all of the 5 seasons, started Torchwood and watched all seasons in a few days. Now, being a new Doctor Who fan, I began playing DW:SSG, and I must say that it's an amazing game. It captures the feel of being The Doctor very well, with every adventure being unique and simply a joy to play. The game is supported by its developer with new expansions, rule changes and possible additions coming out all the time, so I believe it won't be getting repetitive any time soon. The game is constructed in a way that makes adventures feel very logical (in a twisted, Doctor Who kind of way of course) and with a bit of imagination a player can have a lot of fun while adventuring in the TARDIS. Game mechanics are nice and many optional rules or additional actions have been introduced since DW:SSG was created. I don't think I'll be putting this game down soon and I believe it's well worth some effort. When I'm not playing, I'm thinking of my past adventures and I just can't wait to play it again - and that, for me, is enough to call Doctor Who: Solitaire Story Game a truly fantastic game.

I didn't expect to love this as much as I do; I'm not much for dice-based games and huge indices and result matrixes. But I love Dr. Who, and as this is a PNP, I scaled it down enough to fit the booklets in a pocket, and with that, a notepad and a pair of D6s in my pocket, it turns out I *almost* stop minding the insane (and quite routine) five hour wait at my doctor's office. Hats off to Simon Cogan for creating a solitaire game that requires no space.

1 - this is a solitaire game, though I played it for the first time with a friend acting as sort of a DM walking me through it. I'm vaguely familiar with the Dr. Who world and some of the key characters so I could follow along with most of the concepts and events. This game takes place all in your head so it's a very different feel than a usual board or card game as there is nothing tangible other than your dice. For someone who is a big fan of the show(s) or who enjoys story themed games I think they'd enjoy it.

Third try was the charm to get the basic rules right.  I ended up having a trivially easy quest that time, but that appears to be part of the design to ease people into the game.  I'm itching to play again, so that is good.

RATING: 8
This game is a unique experience.  It requires a bit of patient reading, but if you are a Doctor Who fan, then it is worth it.  The game plays as though you are controlling the characters and trying to outsmart the villain.

This game isn't for everyone.  Anyone who likes tactical planning will definitely enjoy working out the actions to take as you try to defeat the enemy.  The dice rolling mechanic gives it an RPG feeling to it, where you are sometimes not quite certain that your well-laid plan will work. This gives the game an uncertainty that is difficult to replicate, and works well in a solitaire game.

If you are starting out, I recommend reading one of the many great session reports to get a feel for how to build your character and how to optimize your actions.

I love storytelling games and this is one of he best I've ever played. It helps that the world and characters are so rich and well developed. You don't need resource books to set he mood or explain anything because it's all in the show.  

Most storytelling games end up taking you to obvious places through the most dull means but this universe definitely encourages thinking outside the box and coming up with wild and crazy conflicts.

This may be a 10 but I need a few more plays to tell how much depth is here...

Note: the games story can be quite random at times but this actually makes the game a more interesting creative challenge. The true challenge of he game is not winning but how to transform these abstract results into a compelling narrative to share with others.

Update: I realized I enjoy turning the events from the game into a story after the fact (it's more creative writing exercise) but I don't actually enjoy playing the game that much.

Doctor Who: Solitaire Story Game is a rare kind of beast. It’s annoying and it’s brilliant, it’s generic and it’s imaginative – and it’s a prime example of the saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, because your enjoyment on the game is very dependent on [i]you[/i].

Doctor Who: Solitaire Story Game
• is a free solitaire RPG-lite set in the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoniverse]Doctor Who universe[/url].
• uses generic descriptions and an innovative game system with roots in choose-your-own-adventure game books and RPGs to tell stories.
• has unclear rules that makes gameplay harder.
• is a game where the enjoyment is completely dependent on the player: It’ll be extremely rewarding for people with vivid imaginations, storytelling skills and willingness to house rule swiftly - and bland for some others.

Recently discovered this game. Reminds me of the 'Fighting Fantasy' books I used to play in the 80s/90s. Faithfully recaptures the TV show. Now they've ported the books to an online wiki, I'm spending online time playing this game now!

Any excellent 0ne-player pnp game (that can also be played all on the computer) with tons of expansions. I printed it 2 pages to a piece of paper and I'm very happy with the size.

Score may go even higher after exploring some of the material beyond the core rules.

On Turn 1 of my first play I felt immersed in the Doctor Who universe.  As a games design hobbyist I feel jealous to see an idea so brilliantly executed.  An obvious labor of love.  Well done.

I have played 7 adventures so far and find the depth and replayability absolutely amazing! I'm now starting to branch out with optional rules and expansion books a little at a time. I also need to find the find the time to attempt to play the classic Doctor adventures, especially number 3! 

Simply a fantastic cohesive adventure!

RATING: 10
I am very impressed with the game's ability to build a coherent storyline out of separate event paragraphs, thanks in large part to the Plot - Enemy - Goal system, which helps provide a built-in narrative structure.  I also very much appreciate the way the game stays true to the spirit of the source material by emphasizing brains over brawn.  Excellent work!

Update: Since posting this nine months ago, I've seen the game develop even further.  In particular, I've seen a lot of hard work on the part of the developer trying to meet the needs of the growing player community.  I wish every game could be so well supported!

The game is fiddly, but after a couple adventures I had the basic idea. I built a character sheet in Excel which helped. It's okay online, but if I get around to printing the booklets off I'll probably enjoy it more.

RATING: 7.5
This is a story based, solitaire game.  The theme is the television series Doctor Who and it is a paragraph based story game.  I was impressed with the detail and the depth of the game.  I marked this game as "owned" meaning I printed the game.  It is available as a free download.  The creator is helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have with the game.  The attention to details and the replayability of this game is what impressed me the most.  I recommend it to anyone, especially if you are a fan of the show!

Intrigued by the idea. Very fun game to play. Its a grown-up "Choose your own adventure novel. Also like the fact there are so many expansions for it. You know how I LOVE expansions! :D

RATING: 9
I'm not the most seasoned gamer, but, this is the most enjoyable one-player system that I have found.  The read paragraph-roll dice-read paragraph set up keeps things moving at a brisk pace.

Now and again, I find myself wanting a little more detail, but that's a small quibble, and a fair trade for the speed of play.

This seems to be a great solitaire game and has a huge amount of future potential, although the rules can be overwhelming at first for newcomers and there are and will be more typos, this has to be expected given the fact it's mainly one main designer working on this.

I love the narrative this game generates and I have now become even more interested in Doctor Who due to this game. Perhaps this game could make a 10 one day, but no game is perfect and there is always room for improvement like anything in life I guess.

I'm really glad I found this game and once again a big thank you to the designer and all the best going forward!

RATING: 10
Great game for a Doctor Who fan! You create adventure as you go out of paragraphs, based on your actions and random encounters. But not too random - they all have enough logic between themselves, to make a "believable" story and yet enough randomness to evade repetitiveness. It looks to me that it is as close to The Doctor's adventures as not to become RPG with prethought story which could lessen replayability. Great stuff when you run out "Doctor Who" episodes to watch.

RATING: 8
Very neat system, very well written and, most importantly, fun.  And it captures the feel of the show (in both old and new versions) surprisingly well.

This is like the classic Lone Wolf or Fabled Lands books on steroids all done in the modern Doctor Who setting!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun little solitaire choose-your-own-adventure-style game.  Reminds me a bit of the old Fabled Lands solo-RPG gamebooks.  In fact, one wonders why the one is a "board game" and the other is a "RPG."  At any rate, I'm a fan of the genre, and this is a fine addition.  (Caveat: I've never seen a single Dr. Who episode, so this is based purely on game-play).

RATING: 8
A great game that is designed to make every play different from the last. Added to that all the expansions just add to the replayability (sic).

Great PnP game.  VERY intricate instructions - will take you a while to get the hang of it but the developer is very nice and will answer questions.  VERY in Depth game - makes for almost unlimited re-playability - feels like you are living an episode :)

Great concept, lots of good material in here, I think.  Created by someone who really loves the source material.  Played again with latest revision and still had questions.  Seems like it could really be fun, maybe three times is the charm.

This is a really enjoyable (and free!) solo game, which I think is really hard to find.  I would have to rate the game lower if based solely on the current ruleset, but updates and additions that are available in the forums (and making you own tweaks) make this a really fun light campaign RPG or good for just an occasional adventure.  This is one that will continue to improve with revisions and expansions.  No excuse for being bored now.

Great game.  It captures the atmosphere of the series really well, especially as it seems better to pick Talk instead of Fight if you can. That really feels like what the Doctor would do.

Nice story building solo game. Really feels like you are having you own Doctor Who adventure. If you have enjoyed some role playing and like Doctor Who you'll like this game. Rules don't cover every situation completely but most of the time you can make a good guess based on what is logical thing to happen in the story. Covering everything would make the rules too big anyway.

A brilliantly intricate, immersive, and generally fun solo RPG (although there's really no reason it couldn't be played multiplayer with different players controlling different companions).

With the four core books alone, it would have been merely wonderful. With the continued (and extensive) support Simon has poured into it, this game is genuinely amazing.

This is a real gem of an adventure game which combines the fun of a choose your own adventure book with enough depth and gameplay to make a player feel like they are able to make meaningful choices to impact whether the Doctor succeeds or fails on his journey.  The designer is also very responsive to fan feedback, and has made many new updates and add-ons to help players keep track of information and enjoy a wide range of new adventures from the history of the show.

The closest thing to being in the TARDIS. Well supported and easy to play. Every game is a new adventure.

I don't think you'll find a similar non commerial game with the wealth of adventure expansions and updates.

Excellent designer support. If you download the game, please take the time to rate and make Simon's day.

Good/Great Solo Game.

Only gripe is a number of minor rules and definitions that could be more clearly set out.

Clearly a big project, but rules especially need a do over to add in clarity and rules that have been added in one spot but not added in another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This has impressive breadth, and attempts to let you just jump in; however, I find some of the game mechanisms confusing.  As to the game itself, it's a gamebook deep in RPG territory:  You select from a small set of options, then roll dice, roll dice, and roll dice, to see what happens.  I suspect that a computerized implementation of this would be much more player-friendly.  :)

Hopefully I can slog through the rest of this and experience an adventure as The Doctor!

Full marks to [person=12403][/person] for doing this!

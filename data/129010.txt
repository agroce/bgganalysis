I loved playing the prototype to this game. Can't wait to play the 5th Street Games edition!

[updated]

Brian Kohrman and 5th Street Games hit it out of the park........ :D

Jungle Ascent is a delight to play. Charming and wonderfully thematic artwork on the board, cards and standees (all done by the designer himself!), thick components, ridiculously fun gameplay. There's even a co-op variant. And it's super-quick to set up! What's not to love? 

Everyone I've shown this game to has thoroughly enjoyed it. Someday I hope I design a game this compelling while also being as easy to set up and play right out of the box -- it's a winner. Great price, too.

I can see it now... This is going to be one of those games that I'm really bad at. I spend more time trying to stop other people from getting anywhere then I do getting anywhere myself. 

The gameplay was quick and fun. It has some neat mechancis and alot of was to screw with your opponents. I can see this game becoming a regular filler.

Had this game for a while, and love it, never get tired of playing it. Its great fun to be so mean to your opponents, but its not one of those games where being mean to someone ruins their day as its all light-hearted fun.
Great theme and artwork, and most people I introduce it to really enjoy it as well!

Boring and bland card laying game with a take that element and a big amount of luck. This isn't worthwhile.

RATING: 6
EDIT:  Gifted away for a prize raffle.  Cute, but don't miss it an ounce.


Decent kids' game.  Not so sure it's not fundamentally flawed in several ways, but kids love the adventure theme and building the board, so a good stepping stone and a decent way to spend some light gaming time with them.

Played with publisher Phil.  This game is quick, simple, and lots of fun.  Good take-that interaction that can be mitigated with smart tactical play.  Kind of a cross between Roborally and Donkey Kong.  And of course gorgeous art!

Solid family and casual game! Easy to learn and plays quickly. Building out the level is really neat, unique, and fun. The cards allow for some neat combos and light take that, which is interactive, but not overly mean or aggressive.

Not bad, but I doubt I'd want to play this game very often. It's OK, but it has a lot of take that, and that just doesn't work for my family.

Sold in auction as it's too confrontational for my group.

A race game where you are simultaneously trying to improve your position while blocking others. Not my favorite style of game, but it works ok here because the game doesn't try to do too much but still has some interesting bits to it.

A near broken take-that game. It's really possible to block all exits, and with a group of gamers with is what will happen. The winner will then be whoever can blow up a totem first. It just went on too long and was only interesting for a little while.

A chaotic and take-that racing game. I've had plays where I essentially stayed at the bottom the whole game and others where I raced to the top. For some reason, my daughters don't mind all the hazards played.

A game I never heard about from a publisher and designer I never heard about. That doesn't mean anything of course. It's just that I have heard of most games before I get to play them.
It was obvious from the get go that this would be a light screw-your-neighbor fest. Which is fine if it doesn't take too long. And it doesn't. But this still isn't really my kind of game. We did encounter a situation where one player would win. So we all did what we could to stop him. But eventually we ran out of things to throw at him, so he just sat there and waited for the right opportunity to pull of a win. It took about 2 rounds. And since everyone was trying hard to stop him, no one else was making progress with their own pawn. Not the most exciting ending.

Initial rating: 5.9

This is my favorite game, the only hurt the leader game that is fun and doesn't go on too long. A player or observer can take in the game at a glance, very easy to teach. ONE THING: play with 3 hazards max per player in competitive game too, makes it hilarious, and you really have to have good hand management for your final dash to the top as everyone else throws everything at you. Best gateway game in existence with super accessible theme, and no VP or other bs to pull you out of it. oh, and forget 2 player, 3 or 4 is golden

Donkey Kong as re-imagined as a boardgame. The game plays fast and is fun enough (even without the barrel-tossing gorilla), but it's a long way down when you inevitably get smacked. Only play this with folks who love to laugh as other players gang up on them.

Temática ótima, com a mecânica de Take that, onde vc coloca armadilhas para prejudica os outros, enquanto tenta chegar no topo, onde há o tesouro. O único problema é a qtd de texto. Certamente um bom jogo para se trazer para o Brasil.

This was my first kickstarted game. I have never played it but I am not sure it would fit what my tastes have evolved into.

I am actually pretty disappointed. I theory the game ? could be fun? I wish I 'd waited to start my kickstarter journey else where.

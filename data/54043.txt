I loved it.  Great 2 player game which has accessible strategy from game one.  Which meant I was immediately into the beautiful "tough choice" position from my first turn! Wonderful.

RATING: 5
A simple and fast commodity trading game, I think it works best in terms of it's size and requirements to learn, and ultimately you're not only trying to exploit the cards that show up as a set collection aspect, but also knowing that your opponent is working on similar sets. The camel piece is a nice touch and helps move the center market along. I do think having the most camels at the end is under valued though, but not by much. Maybe that's intentional, I don't know.

Ultimately though, it's not the quick game I'm most inclined to reach for, but it is fun when it does hit the table. I think the best of three rounds for scoring can drag, but it almost takes that long to get a feel for how the game is going to progress...

Awfully fiddly for what it is, and a very clunky way to implement market pricing and bonus scoring. For those reasons, and the increased variety of rules, I prefer the app to the game. All in all, it is a fun amusement for awhile. And it does manage to represent many economic concepts albeit in very abstract ways.

There are much, much better set collection a/o trading games out there tho.

Been playing a lot of the Android version. I like the basic trading mechanism and the diminishing returns of the points but I think the bonus points and the luck of the draw are terrible. The variable bonus tiles make one point games seem like pointless affairs and I've seen plenty of 20+ point blowouts (definitely a few 40s and I think a 50) simply due to one player getting all the expensive goods. 

In fact, the luck of the draw is so pronounced that when one player gets a camel lock, you can easily get into a cycle where both players simply take the only card available, hoping to out-draw their opponent. The hardest level AI agrees with me on this so I feel pretty confident it's the correct play. If they take camels they don't touch my majority, if I take camels I am gaining no points and giving my opponent an opportunity to get a good group of cards. So here we sit, top-decking and hoping for high value cards, with score and timing meaning nothing.

I feel like a good game could be designed from the core mechanism, perhaps by normalizing the bonus tokens and by implementing a Power Grid style upcoming queue. 

Perfectly acceptable as a time-waster phone game but not something I would purchase to play physically. It's also hilariously overpriced for a deck of cards and some tokens. And I'm a guy that puts value on design over components.

Really great game! Not many choices and each choice makes a different!  Components is excellent!  You do feel the tense when you make the choice because you've to minimize what the other player do or maximize yours.

RATING: 6
It plays a little blah and random the first time through, but after one or two more plays the strategy comes through and that adds to the experience.

There's still practically no strategy to the game itself. It's purely a human-to-human guessing game about what the other person will do, and the game is just a mechanism for letting you prove that out one way or the other. And, in a sense, the fact that the game has distilled itself down to that level is fairly impressive. But ultimately the decisions are so simple that guessing right about what the other person will do lacks enough oomph for me. Even my mom felt that it seemed a bit overly-light.

That said, I bought this one because it looked like it had more to it than Lost Cities. So I guess, good thing I didn't buy that one as well!

Excellent. Only one move per turn, so it plays quickly, but a lot of tricky decisions to make. You always have to be careful of what you're leaving your opponent and, other than the initial deal, you always can get some idea of what your opponent is trying to collect (and then just sneak in to grab the high tokens). It's really simple, quick, and challenging. I like it. It's not Innovation or Battle Line, but it's solid. (Though Innovation + expansion takes a loooong time to set up)

Rules-wise, Jaipur is simplicity itself.  It's a game of set collection, with the various commodities you are collecting worth different amounts.  There are also substantial bonuses for large sets.  The catch is that while you are clogging your hand with a single commodity, your nimble opponent may have sold several smaller sets and be speeding the round towards its conclusion.  He may even have sold some goods of the type you are collecting, to reduce your set's value.  A fine game.

Production quality is very good and the artwork is quite appealing.  The rules are a clear and easy read.

RATING: 7
A game that is well designed for what it seeks to accomplish: a quick, interesting, two player card game.

Not exactly fireworks, and certainly not as magical (?!) in its appeal as the curiously pleasing mechanism of Coloretto, which would go on to evolve into the award winning boardgames of Zooleretto and Aquaretto, but worthy in its own way. The designer of Jaipur, Pauchon is truly a good game designer.  

You can play this game almost meditatively and feel like you "gamed" with a certain amount of intelligence and effort.  Yet, did you? Maybe so...

Because the online version handles the relatively involved set up and bookkeeping (at least for a card game) easily, curiously, this game perhaps plays better online.  In fact, this game could definitely be an international hit with the online gaming community.  Move over words with friends?  Well, not exactly, but there is clearly something "there" with this game.  I would call it almost meditative as an online experience.  On the other hand, I suppose one could agonize over all the decisions!  Nah, play it quick and meditatively! : )

Incredibly simple card game designed for 2 players that is very quick to teach and learn. While not a brain-burner, it offers a surprising amount of strategy as you try to gather up the cards you want while trying to deny your opponent the ones you think they want. Great little game for $20.

A two-player game with trading? 
Why yes, it is. Jaipur is on BGG's Top 100 games of all time and deserves to be there. Simple but strategic this game is fantastic. You collect cards by trading from a central market. Then you use set collection of those cards to trade it for victory points from stacks of goods. Be the first to get there and you get more points. This might just be one of the best two player games in the industry.

Very enjoyable 2 player game.
Easy to teach and to play. Normally it takes 3 rounds to identify the winner. Naturally some luck is involved by drawing of the cards but that is ok.
Components looks good and colorful cards.
The camels are funny to look at (look out for the Panda).
A little bit fiddly for the setup. But with some routine it takes not too much time to sort the pieces. Especially if both player help.
I gave it already 2 times as a small present.

Das Spiel ist neuen Mitspielern schnell erklärt. Da es sich schnell aufbauen lässt und sich auch schnell ein paar mal hintereinander spielen lässt, kommt es bei Wenigspielern bisher sehr gut an. Die direkte Konfrontation ist relativ gering; natürlich kann man seinem Mitspieler ab und zu eine gute Karte wegschnappen aber auf die Dauer bringt einem das nicht zwangsläufig den Sieg und daher muss man sich vor allem um seine eigenen Verkäufe kümmern um sich die Gunst des Kalifen zu verdienen. Wenn beide Spieler einige Spiuele gespielt haben ist das Ergebnis im Allgemeinen ziemlich ausgeglichen, d.h. jeder hat eine faire Chance zu gewinnen.

A nice two-player game, albeit with an annoying luck element (namely, when you take the camels your opponent is invariably presented with juicy silver/gold/ruby cards for the plucking).  Still, it has interesting tactical decisions and the gameplay is addictive. All "small" games should be at least this good or stay unpublished.

An immediately-compelling 2-player card game. At first, seems to simple to even be fun, but then you realize all of the things you have to think about while playing -- can I afford to discard this card? Can I afford to take these camels and give my opponent that many new cards to see? Can I force my opponent to take all these camels so I get five new cards to choose from? Much fun, and I'm looking forward to playing a lot more.

Great economic card game in which you're buying and selling camels and goods to collect markers that you will score at the end of a round.

It has an incredibly simple set of rules, but it definitely has a lot of strategic play. It is also a huge bonus that you can play a full game in well under 30 minutes.

Initially I found this game to be quite enjoyable and of in the same vein as Battle line (stereotypical 2-player couple's game). But eventually I discovered that players could count the cards by simplify referencing the good tokens, which eliminated the whole memorization aspect; and that aspect was important as it allowed players to make informed decisions if they could track/memorize the cards that had been played.

But, after a couple of dozen plays... it dawned on me. There is little need to memorize what has been played because of the good tokens. Admittedly, I felt a bit stupid for not realizing it sooner. But it also reduced my enjoyment of the game because it made the luck/randomness element much more palatable. I started to see the outcomes of games being dictated by the luck of the draw... and I loss interest in playing it. 

Great components. Certainly a well-received game and something that many people find enjoyable. Just don't expect this game to withstand competitive play.

RATING: 7
The components in this game are quite lovely, with the nice cards (quite easy to riffle shuffle) and lovely cardboard counters, with a thick enough. The insert to keep them all in is quite nice.

As for the game itself, I'm not quite as enthusiastic. The game is easy to learn and figure out, and it takes about as much time as it should. I just wonder if it doesn't get too samey, with it playing out the same over and over again, and scores generally in the 60-80 range. I also wonder if there's a first-turn advantage.

Egy nagyon jól sikerült kétszemélyes kártyajáték! A tevék feldobják, pörgőssé teszik. Nagyon kiegyenlített, szinte mindig 80 pont körül szóródtunk, +-5 pont, egyszer volt 90 feletti pontszám (összesen 5 menet volt a 2 játék során).
---
14 játék után már ritkán nyerünk nagy különbséggel, ezért a pontszámok is kisebbek. Úgy gondolom, 70 pont feletti eredmény már nem rossz, ha egyenlő erők küzdenek. (Megjegyzés: ha jól számolom, az elméleti maximum 189 pont: 3 kivételével az összes áru = 127, teve = 5, az összes 5-ös bónuszlapka, és 2 db 4-es bónusz = 57... Persze ehhez az kell, hogy a másik fél 0 pontot érjen el, és a lapok megfelelő sorrendben jöjjenek.)
---
Kipróbáltuk 4 fővel, azért úgy nem az igazi:) De mégis megéri néha így is, más élményt ad!
---
Egyre több taktikai lehetőségre jövünk rá. Szerintem kisebb a szerepe a szerencsének, mint ahogy az elsőre látszik.
---
Majdnem 4 év telt el az utolsó beírásom óta:) Rengeteg partin vagyok túl, és aquir jóvoltából a neten is sikerült kipróbálnom. Nos elég lesújtó a véleményem a netes Jaipurról (és nem azért, mert aquir levert 3-2-re:)). Egyszerűen a Jaipur lényegét öli meg azzal a program, hogy mindent mutat: milyen lapok mentek ki, milyen lapokat vett fel ill. adott el az ellenfél, hány tevéje van, hány pontja(!) van, stb. Gyakorlatilag a kezdő lapjain kívül és a húzott bónuszain kívül minden ismert (még a bónuszokkal is lehet kalkulálni, mert pl. azt látjuk, hogy 67 és 75 pont között áll, tehát nagy eséllyel kb. 71-72 pontja lehet, és a saját pontunknál is oda van írva, hogy mondjuk 62 pontunk van, de az ellenfél annyit tud, hogy 58 és 65 között...) Az a gond, hogyha nem ezzel az esőember üzemmóddal játszanánk, akkor pedig előnybe kerülne az, aki írná, ha a másik esetleg nem írná. Márpedig ha naponta néhány lépés van csak, akkor muszáj lenne írni. Szóval pont az veszik így el, ami miatt szeretjük ezt a játékot: természetesen az élő játékban sosem vesszük annyira komolyan, hogy mindent memorizálni próbáljunk, rengetegszer múlik azon, hogy nem emlékszünk, hogy 10-15 körrel korábban vett-e fel az ellenfél mondjuk aranyat, és tök izgi bekockáztatni, hogy hátha nincs sárgája, vagy hogy hány tevéje lehet vajon, elég-e az 5 teve az 5 ponthoz. Vagy a legalapvetőbb kérdés, hogy ki vezet éppen? A gépen játszva az esetek 95%-ában pontosan tudhatom, hogy vezetek vagy sem. Élőben max ha külön számolom... Ezzel együtt, még így is, hogy számtanpéldává degradálódik a neten a játék, voltak hihetetlen izgalmas partik. Másfajta izgalom volt így, de még így is jó volt:) Lehet hogy kicsit túlértékelem ezt a játékot, de nekem továbbra is nagyon bejön.

Enjoy playing this. Like Traders of Carthage it gives more tough decisions than you might expect for a small game that's easy to learn. 

The rules are SUPERIOR! Clearly stated with excellent examples. Compared to some other games of this depth, Jaipur's rules just raised the bar a bit!

After a while, the thrill is gone. Traded.

An attractive card game with feminine colors! It is simply to teach and seems to have good depth. I do not care for the random point chits collected after selling 3 or more goods, I think the game would be more precise and calculating if an exact number of additional points would be given. Some people prefer more randomness but to me the draw of the cards is sufficient.

The game is fairly easy to learn set collection game with a shared market (pool of goods for both players).
It becomes quickly to a light in-your-face game as players grab the valuable goods and generally those goods that the other player is collecting, thus neglecting them.

It plays 2 to 3 rounds with each round lasting about 10 minutes.

Loved it!  Simplicity breaking down two-player board gaming into it's component parts.  Thinking back on my first best-of-three play what comes to mind isn't the bits and cards and how we moved them around.  Instead, it was more an impression of how the flow of the game shifted back and forth between my opponent and I.  And how we acted and counter-acted, etc.  

I thought that spoke to the absolute simplicity of what's going on in the game.  I don't know if the "9" rating will stand the test of time though.  The reason being that I get the sense that the game could wear thin with further play, as if maybe it's too simple.  

So, if there's a weakness to this game, it might be that it's too simple and there isn't enough here.  I can live with that.  It's a '9' for now.  And I'd like to get a copy, when I can, just for those "one more game" nights or introducing friends to board games.

Jaipur is lovely for quick play with one other person and even offers some satisfying choices. Do I wait to take a big set of cards and risk letting the other player grab the highest price for a good? How do I leave the market in terrible shape for them or do they want all those camels? 

There is a panda hidden on one of the cards. I can appreciate hidden pandas.

It's a hit with my girlfriend, but also solid for strategy and tactics. That makes it a pretty big win in my book. Luck is not absent, but overall better play will win. And I'm always more forgiving of luck elements when a game plays quick and the winner is determined over multiple rounds rather than one. In this case it's whoever wins 2 rounds out of 3. (And I have to add, that the more we play the more often we find ourselves tied or 1 point away from each other's scores for the round! That's got to mean it's more balanced than it appears, right...?) You have to decide how much to push your luck, and it's necessary to monitor you opponent and see what cards he or she is grabbing, how many cards are in hand, how many camels are in his or her herd, etc. So tactically, you should be able to shift short term plans based on what your opponent is doing. Nicely interactive. Just a really solid 2 player game. The rules are extremely simple and leave room for surprisingly meaty choices. And most important, it's really fun!

Nice two player game.  It's push your luck/hand management type of game.  Using your camels are key.  It's tense as you are trying to grab the top stacks of the goods as they are worth the most points and keeping an eye on what the other player is doing.  It's simple but there is enough in the game to keep it interesting.  Just what a good, quick two player game should do.

// I think this is the quintessential set collection game
for 2 players. It's smooth, fast, and relatively simple, 
but still takes some planning and good decision-making to
pull off a win. My only complaint is that when playing
multiple rounds (which you really should, as the manual
dictates), counting points and setting everything up again
can kind of take the wind out of your sails just a bit.

Great filler for 2 players, my wife loves it.

*update*

Each time I play it, I like it a little more which is a great thing given that it's a filler an usually this type of games have little margin to grow on gamers.

It's a wonderful and clever little game, strictly for 2 players, full of interesting decisions.

Very fun and fast two player card game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Straight-forward (and simple) rules and gameplay, but the game feels average.  Strategically, it's probably best to focus on one expensive set and one cheap set of goods (at any given time) in order to try to maximize your chances of getting good bonuses.  Now I just need to remember that you cannot sell solo gold, silver or red (diamond)!

UPDATE 2014: An okay but luck-heavy game of set collection and brinksmanship.  Sets consist of 2+ cards of the same type of good.  For most goods, the sooner you sell a set, the more points you'll get per individual card sold.  The hand limit of 7 cards is another major factor in deciding when/what to sell.  If you hold out longer and collect a set of 3+ cars, you'll earn bonus points based on the number of cards you sell.  The brinksmamship aspect of the game is primarily related to deciding when to take multiple camel cards since it can reveal several new cards (instead of one) which can be detrimental to your game if you reveal to many cards that help your opponent; therefore, it can be better to take just a single goods card (versus multiple camels).  That said, the game is won or lost by luck of the draw and carefully managing the hand limit.

RATING: 6
Lightweight two player filler. The mechanics are simple but work alright. It's like many two player games that have a collection element, in that it comes down to timing your actions right. This means constantly assessing which cards your opponent has collected and how much you are prepared to push your luck.

Luck. That's certainly a factor which is a tad too high for my taste in this one. But since it's not a game that takes itself too seriously, that's okay I guess. But the cards that become available each time you turn a new one can have a big impact.

Awesome game for 2 players (one of the best for 2) between other more difficult titles. I think there is luck factor in this game so not everything depends on our move. I hope in the future they will add expansion that allows to play with more than 2 players. It is the perfect game if You're going somewhere You know You won't have space and much time.

Now one of my favorite games Great 2 player Game. Each person trying to out manipulate the other. I feel 1st player has the advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
25 plays in: Has a calming flow to it, a rhythm and balance that make winning and losing not seem like the point. Setup is a pain in the ass, though, with sorting all the metal coin tokens by value, though once you get familiar with them, you don't really need to do more than sort by color. And "let's see who had the higher score" is always a weak way to end a game. Doesn't jump off the shelf like, say, Monopoly Deal, but we're always glad we played it.

The strategy is truly elegant and unique here -- the role of the camels is simple yet deepens the game immensely. And there is a direct back-and-forth push and pull of the players' impact on each other, which makes gameplay intimate and satisfying.

Gets asked for very often; always seems like fun and not homework, and yet skilled players definitely do better. Just a perfect gem of a game.

I do wish the front cover didn't have such a cringe-inducing caricature of an Indian man.

Quick and great.  You do not feel as pressed to make a perfect move as you do in some other two player games, like Battle Line.  This is a bit more light hearted where luck still prevails a bit but the better player will usually come out on top overall.

Unremarkable 2 player filler. It's light, it's pretty quick to explain - but luck is a significant factor in game play, if you get a run of high value goods you'll do well. Overall felt pretty underwhelmed playing it - nothing obviously wrong, just not much fun. Many other quick 2 player games I'd rather play.

This is one of the most cut-throat games I own. Stealing cards that you don't really need, just to make sure your opponent doesn't get them happens all of the time. Plays quickly and easy to learn. Great components and art.

RATING: 8
Excellent two player game.  The wife loves it as well.  Decisions come up every turn as you weigh the risks and rewards of going for big scores and bonus chips or trying to nickel and dime your way to victory.  About the only negative I can think of is the somewhat tedious set up between rounds...but that's a minor quibble.  Excellent game, and if you have a non-gamer spouse that you want to play 2 player games with it is practically a no-brainer to pick this up.

Good, light 2-player game. We played not knowing you could trade camels for cards so that might have changed the game slightly. Absolutely would play again, seems like a fun game you could get some quick game plays in. Still though, for 2-player relatively quick games, Patchwork or 7 Wonders Duel definitely seem to be better in terms of depth and just plain fun.

It plays fairly quickly and there is more depth to it than you think; until you play it. There are various strategies and you may even have to change strategy based on how your opponents play. It's also easy to learn and teach, so you can get non-gamers to sit down with you to play and I have found that usually they are quickly hooked. Something that rarely happens with my wife.

After 12 plays on Yucata, I'm upgrading my rating to a 10. This has everything a card game should have, and has just the right balance of skill and luck. Not sure how I'd feel about playing it ftf with a physical copy, but I can't get enough of it on Yucata.

This is a fantastic 2-player card game. Just enough going on to keep you engaged, but not overwrought. Just like Lost Cities in that regard. Might not hold up much past a few dozen plays, but it'll be really fun getting to that point. And who knows; just like any traditional card game, it could get to the point (like Ingenious) where it's a pleasant way to pass the time even if you're not giving it 100% undivided attention.

Played online. Rarely has a game gone from hero to zero as fast as this game. While I can give the designer credit for trying to creat something innovative, the game is an excrutiating luck stand off fest between players of equal skill. You pull a card and hope a high value card does not fall. Each player tries to slow the game down by making piecemeal sales and pawning camels to avoid having to draw a new card and possibly reveal a nice card for their opponent, kinda like who blinks first loses. Arrgh. Gameplay is actually very limited. Just feels like all the excitement I had for the game evaporated after the first few plays. It is a shame as it is a nice concept and could work re-designed multiplayer.

This is a great two-player game. You can learn the rules in less than a minute, but the game is complex enough to keep your interest for the duration of the three rounds. 

The best aspect of the game is the fact that you have to draw from the market, and your cards are limited to the number of goods you have to trade. So you will sometimes have to give up cards you want, or give your partner cards he/she needs, in order to make the most lucrative trades.

Jaipur is a combination of hand management and set collecting game. This game does not let you have more than 7 cards in hand and it balances the game in such way you need to manage the resource carefully. The camel is the distractor that in a way also balances the game that much so the game will not have this kind of unlimited loop of trading that will lead to a stall. I cannot say I like the game that much because the randomisers vary so much sometimes you really cannot keep up when you are behind. I do like how it is simple to learn and to play. This would be a good filler and even a very easy gateway for some newbies.

Light but enjoyable 2p-only game. One knock on it is that the setup time isn't trivial, so for a super quick game I'd still prefer classics like Lost Cities or Battleline, or newer games like Fairy Tale. But once everything is set up the game is quite fun. The camel mechanic is a distinctive characteristic, and my wife and I both enjoy managing our "herds."

Fairly unimpressed. Smooth-playing, but no theme and not much game. A simple melding game, but there is just so much better stuff out there. Lost Cities is several light-years better, as are various Keltis games, Battle Line, Jambo, etc. Not recommended.

Our favourite two-player by far, we will never tire of this! Beautiful aesthetics and absolutely wonderfully engaging game. Tactical rather than strategic. Some set-up time, but the game play is more than worth it! 

Edit: Battle Line has replaced this as our favourite 2-player, but still enjoy Jaipur when we do play it.

Edit autumn 2016: Port Royal has proven even more addictive for us, but I will always enjoy Jaipur.

A cleverish game of hand and camel management in order to impact the timing of displaying new items in the market. A timing that is based on the other player's camel holdings and hand.

However, there is only so much you can do, and all too often for me, it's one player who acquires the majority of the high value items and wins the game.

Rummy-type game with a card draft for draws and melds with values dependent on number of cards melded (higher value for more cards) and first to meld each suit (early melds with more than late melds).

Although this game is fun, the risk-reward element is not nearly as large as most people think because first melds and larger melds have the same value.

[u]April 2014:[/u] A very good economic two player game. One has to balance taking many small chits later vs some big chits sooner. There is some blocking going on with the market. Not a revolutionary game per se but one that we both enjoy a lot. I still prefer Traders of Carthage but this one si shorter and easier to get out. This is one of our go-to card game when playing at a terrace in the summer.

RATING: 7.5
It gets a high grade because it's a great light filler game, so it's not the same good grade as for instance San Marco or Glen More, which I would of course prefer to play when having the time for a "real", meatier board game). Nevertheless, despite the luck of the draw in the gameplay, this is one of the best lighter games for 2 players.

RATING: 6
Rated initially an "8." My wife tends to enjoy playing the same game numerous times instead of seeking something new. Consequently, if I guide her toward a game, I do so knowing that it better hold up over numerous plays (see: Ingenious, Lost Cities). 

Jaipur caught my interest as a sort of Lost Cities: Part II. And there's some definite similarities in how they play... quick rapid-fire turns, short game time, balance of luck and tactics, etc. At the same time, this offers enough "newness" that I'm prepared for the 50+ plays it will likely get!

Compared to Lost Cities, Jaipur has a more fiddly setup, with stacking all the coins in the correct order. But, the game itself offers some more choices and more direct interaction, which I'm thankful for. It's easier to try and "jam" your opponent with bad or limited choices (five camels?? Oh great.) Any fans of Lost Cities looking for a new "spouse game" should definitely check this out. 

Update:  Ultimately, this game sat on the shelf, and sat on the shelf... my wife and I simply couldn't get excited about this one. With 25+ plays, we had our fun with the game, but Jaipur has lost out to Battle Line and other two-player-friendly card game options.

A great two player game. Requires a lot of moving pieces around. Love playing it on BGA, but at the table it's a little cumbersome.

One of the best two-player games out there.

Lovely little card game that, while not particularly interesting, just feels good. The flow of the game is perfect for a low-stakes time-passing game - ideal for my wife and me after we put the kids to bed. This puts it very much into the same category as Lost Cities or Hansa or San Juan. Ultimately, the luck of the cards and the bonus chips is going to determine the winner between two well-matched opponents, but the game is handsome and there are enough pleasant (albeit mostly false) decisions to make it an enjoyable experience.

Si te compras Jaipur debes tener claro lo que te estas comprando, Jaipur es un filler de treinta-cuarenta minutos que se juega muy rápido. Pero el hecho de que sea un filler no quiere decir que sea una tontería para jugar y pasar el tiempo, en Jaipur ganará mas veces el jugador que sepa jugar sobre el que no lo sepa, a pesar de que hay algo de suerte. Es un gran juego, rápido fácil de jugar, mecánicas que se encadenan con fluidez y  muchas posibilidades tácticas en cada movimiento. Los componentes son de buena calidad. Es uno de los pocos juegos económicos para dos jugadores que funciona bien. No lo dudes si lo que buscas es un juego sencillo pero con más miga que Lost Cities.

A two-player super-filler with some sharp elbows. A rummy variant should have enough going on to make it superior to rummy, and Jaipur hits the nail on the head with a little bit of push-your-luck action.

RATING: 8.5
Great girlfriend game. Two player, nice and simple, best of three rounds - so it doesn't hurt either side when you see that there is no way of winning: "Ill just try again next round!"

The rulebook is written VERY well. 

The chit system is very well put together and makes you click on to strategies after a few goes.

The camel cards are in a fine balance between being good and being bad in the wrong, or right hands. 

Very quick set up time if you pack it away correctly, and uses a "dont know your score till the end" mechanism which always makes games a little more exciting!

My girlfriend and I (now my finoce) actually went to Jaipur on holiday before buying this, made it all the more enjoyable 

Highly rated, cheap, small footprint, fun for 2 players

(Homemade with face cards)

Played mostly online with a few in person plays teaching my wife to see what she thought.

At first the game appears to be a great balance of lightness and strategy. With repeated plays however it becomes a game of stalling until the luck of the draw falls your way. It can still be enjoyable but often I feel like the draw really throws the game into or out of my hands.

I love this game and I think just about everybody should have a copy! It is easy to teach, and fun for new players, but has enough strategy, bluffing and interest to the play to have a lot of replay value.

An excellent, light, casual 2 player game. 

I love it for so many reasons. The first one being that 99% of the time, I'm playing board games with only one person (my boyfriend) and we're both pretty competitive people. This game is light enough (so neither of us are mad about losing) but still got that fun competitive edge. 

It plays really fast but you still have to be strategic. It's a good way to spend 15 minutes without feeling like you're mentally exhausted afterwards. Both players also draw from the same cards, so there are no uneven roles like a lot of 2 player games. It's a card game (with some extra tokens) so the box is very portable and good for travel.

PLUS: I'm a designer. There are a lot of games out there that are fun, but not really well designed IMO. This satisfies that design itch. The illustrations are bright and cute and the box looks great on my shelf.

Probably the most replayed and enjoyed game we have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's no doubt that this is a well-designed game with an attractive theme, but there's not enough game there to keep me interested. There seems to be a dominant strategy (show your opponent as few new cards as possible) which renders the game pretty dull. I am somewhat puzzled that this is rated as highly as it is.

RATING: 8
Great couple game.  Really rich in theme, giving the feeling of a marketplace while playing.  Nice balance between luck and skill.  Rather simplistic though, and easy to get burned out on it, so don't play it too much at first (it is tempting since it is a very fun game).

In fact I felt like I must be missing something, but the rules are pretty simple with no room for misinterpretation (that's good at least). But there just isn't much game there. The winning strategy seems to be "shuffle the deck such that good cards come up on your turn". Very few interesting decisions. Also, I'm a bit non-plussed by the idea that the game is so simple that the official rules say that the real winner is the player to win 2 out of 3 rounds. And each round is a complete reset, with nothing carrying forward from round to round. Just not that interesting. I'll probably play a few more times just to be sure though, but for now I feel like it's about done. Or am I still missing something??? (Send me mail if you think I am; I'm genuinely curious.)

Great game for playing with your wife. It is only for 2 persons, but easy to learn while still have a bit of techniques to learn before mastering it. I am playing a lot of games, my wife is not. But she is always beating me in this game :-) Also my daughter 8 y old loves it. A bit too simple for the hardcore gamer, but a well made game with good balance.

I purchased this game during Spiel 2009 after two trial games; the first went very much awry because of the rather odd rules explanation which didn't seem to make any sense until I read through the rule book. Since then I've played about a dozen games, each time losing badly against my main gaming partner (the girlfriend), and ever since I figured out how to turn the tables a little, my appreciation for this card game has grown.

The idea is very simple, really. Open cards in various kinds (goods and camels) allow you to trade (meaning that you take two or more goods and replace them by cards in your hand and/or previously gathered camels), purchase (meaning taking one good and replacing it with a card drawn from the pile) or simply to get all camels, (which are then all replaced by cards taken from the draw pile). At some point you want to be collecting sets and sell them, for which you get a equal number of chips with points on them and, if you sold enough in one go, a bonus chip. The trick is that the value of the chips diminishes so that selling the same goods later in the game won't net you as many points as in the beginning.

As I said: simple, and you'd be absolutely right. But to play it well is [i]not[/i] simple, despite what you would be able to read in the negative comments. The main problem is that any action which fills the open spaces of taken-up cards by cards from the draw pile might give your opponent a very valuable set which he then sells on his own. But at the same time you cannot keep on selling forever because the net result is too meager as the chips are too low in value. You need to obtain sets in that case, and that means hoarding cards and biding your time. These and other simple dynamics create an atmosphere where both players must watch each other like hawks, and be forever on the lookout to score lots of points as efficiently as possible, to the point where card counting becomes a necessity of sorts. The bonus chips introduce a little uncertainty in the entire procedure to prevent complete control, which keeps things fresh and interesting without undue worries—although theoretically the game can be lost on the randomised point difference. More worrying is that in some cases a player getting a very good selection of extremely valuable goods out of sheer luck of the draw more or less walks away with victory right there and then. In a game where timing, hand management and a bit of memory are key components, such  occurrences feel like jamming the proverbial wrench in the gears. True, the game is fast enough to demand a rematch, but still. 

Despite this tiny rough edge I found myself liking this game quite a lot, and would heartily recommend it over that ageing Lost Cities. Jaipur scratches the same itch, but deciding what to do when is a more involved, making it more of an interesting experience to see if your luck paid off. I'm quite interested to see whether I will hit a point beyond which I will not play this game any longer.

Have played this a lot, the app version has a few different market conditions (reverse order, each good is traded at a consistent value--that of the highest token for each, hand limit of 5, require 2/3 of a kind instead of 1/2) that have given much more variability in the strategy.  A lot of fun.

A great trading game with a great theme! Beautiful artwork that you get to hold and trade, nice components, easy to learn and teach, fast setup and play time, engaging and exciting with equal parts chance and decisiveness, this game offers a lot in a little box.

I really enjoy the various aspects of this game that demand balance from the player, including:
1. A hand limit that forces trading and tradeoffs between cards held and those desired in the market;
2. The ability to take any one card from the market or exchange any number of cards, meaning a player can increase his holdings slowly by direct acquisition or pay the price of stagnating to quickly obtain several sought after cards at once through even exchange - such that opportunity cost functions get involved in this market simulation; and
3. A tiered point system that rewards timely action: will you trade your few goods in for the quick early bird advantage of a high payout, or risk the odds and hold out for a potentially high-value set?

Add to all this the thrill of revealing unknown new cards every turn, one of which could be your coveted prize, and you have an addictive game for any night of the week, and you only need one other person to play!

I bought this game to play with a friend who doesn't enjoy as much our gaming group's heavier Eurogames, but still likes a challenge and a good theme - and it foots the bill perfectly. Will play again and again.

This is a fast and light-hearted game for two players.  Through trading or acquiring cards in the market, you try to collect sets and then trade them in for the bonus tiles of that color when you sell.  The twist is you really need to manipulate caravans (camel cards) to acquire several cards at once.

I like the choices facing players - to cash in on the valuable items, or go deep with the cheap ones?  Should you strive to be the caravan master for a few bonus points, or use those cards quickly to get a nice haul?

Supremely easy to learn and very fast to play.  This is a good filler while watching a TV show or waiting for dinner to finish cooking.  Bright and colorful, this also would do well with kids.

Jaipur is a fiiiiiiine game. It's only 2 players, so I don't play it much (I expected that at time of purchase), but when I do, I enjoy it very much. I just noticed many of my favorite games have the set collection mechanic!

2017 update: I pushed the rules of this game many times to accomodate as many as 4 players and it's worked very well!

I get the feeling that Jaipur is flying a little below the radar on BGG.  The reviews I've seen recommended Jaipur as the "next good spouse friendly" two player game.  I have to agree.  My wife readily plays, and has been the one to suggest a second or third play.  After a few games, I'm beginning to think Jaipur reminds me of Ticket to Ride more than anything else.  Sure, there is no board, but the basic mechanism is set collection to purchase a limited supply of points.  The limited hand size, the camel trading, the varying point values, and the bonuses, all lead to a surprising amount of tactical decisions.

Components: The tokens are a bit cumbersome to set up, but otherwise the game is functional and attractive. Super easy to teach.

Experience: Simple set collection game. It's fun to collect goods cards, to buy a bunch of camels, or to go shopping in the market. Has a tiny press-your-luck element, as I try to secure a tastier purchase, hoping my opponent doesn't have the cards to end the round. The bonuses for large sets help stall the game. Finding that camels are useful to take cards from the middle without revealing anything juicy from the deck, thus blocking my opponent.

I'm really not sure about this game. I've played it several times, and I'm not sold on it. It just feels like all you do is collect cards then turn them in--not exactly exciting! It could be that we haven't always been very careful to ensure we don't have more than seven cards in hand. Some of the comparisons I've seen of Jaipur to Lost Cities are absolutely ridiculous! There's no comparison whatsoever!

Update: I've made up my mind: I do like this game. We used to play this without paying much attention to the hand-limit (we forgot about it). If you play strictly with the seven card hand-limit, the game really shines, offering tough decisions. It's a great 2-player game, and I'd much rather play this over Lost Cities.

This is likely the first game I've encountered that literally takes only two minutes to learn.  But there's not much game underneath that simplicity.  In fact, there's plenty of randomness, and your best choices are easily discernible.

Jaipur was a really positive surprise for me. The rules are very simple and yet the gameplay offers plenty space for strategic and tactical play. The way this two player game simulates trading is interesting - you are in a way making offers to the other player, trying to get him to react in the way that benefits you. There is a slight amount of randomness, which is a good thing because it seriously limits the possibility of analysis paralysis this game might otherwise cause.

Be careful: they spit.

I'd like a camel to spit on this game whenever it comes out so I have an excuse to not play it. As it stands, I've tried it several times, and I've tried adapting my play and yet I have never won nor do I care to at this point. Seems it's all about trying to get certain goods from the available cards without setting your opponent up to get a better take. There's just not enough to this game for me because the sparse game that is there bores and annoys me.

Rating based on initial impressions...

Bought this game specifically to play with my wife after reading what has been posted here and from what I can tell so far, I will enjoy this game.

But my wife had a pretty negative reaction to it, which surprised me. She didn't like that an action or possible mistake on her part led to an immediate negative consequence. She might have simply been unlucky, but I did always seem to get the diamond/gold cards ahead of her. It's too soon to tell if she made poor decisions or if she truly kept having bad luck. She had this to say: "I feel like the game is playing me and not the other way around." She likes games where she can utilize long-term planning and she never felt she could take such an approach with this one. Given how much she liked Archaeology: The Card Game, I certainly didn't expect such a reaction from her.

Very good two player game. One of the best. Stands up there with Lost Cities. 

This is essentially a trading game where each player trades with the marketplace. The player interaction and tension comes in the form of taking goods before the other player does and deciding to sell early for larger profit or wait to sell more at a bigger bonus.

One of my new favorite filler games.  This one wins the award for getting my wife to play a game with me that we both will enjoy.  Beautifully simple cards and components in an elegant box.  Game has just the right amount of luck and strategy to keep you wanting to play again.  The seven card hand limit and camels moving back and forth through play makes for some tough decisions, as does the diminishing returns on the goods tokens.  Excellent game that anyone can learn on their first try.  This game will make it to the table quite a bit.

What a fun two-player game. Easy to learn and it goes fast once you got it down.

Jaipur is a nice trading card game in which timing and hand managent are the key to victory. Although the rules are quite simple, there's more to the game than you would expect on first sight. The nice thing is that you can play it rather relaxed with hidden information or use the variant with open information that is used on Yucata.de. I prefer the latter one since it adds some more depth to the game but I wouldn't try it this way with more casual gamers. Fun game!

If you love cards, love to play quickly and get a charge out of a good, close game that MOVED, this is definitely for you.

Edit: For a quick 2p cardgame there are simply too many far, far better options: Oh My Goods, Traders of Osaka/Carthage, Red7, Parade, Behind the Throne, Morels... 

I'll probably give this away at some point. I can't see ever choosing it. Even with my little 5 year old niece, who still gets a thrill when she turns over diamonds or gold, there are so many better games to play.

The game is perfect 10-rating on ioS app...gameplay is fast, smooth, and all the set-up time/math scoring is done automatically. My current go-to "filler" game app.

Rummy-esque, set collection with a good decisions to be made on each turn.  Games are often very tight in score, even when playing against kids.  
It's a well -designed game with a just a hint of tactics/strategy to make it interesting each game.

Two player almost-Knizia combo collection. I don't understand why is it a two player game. There are bunch of these combo collection games and I don't remember any of them being a two player ones. A stupid restriction. That's why there is no reason for anyone to buy this, because there are similar games for larger amounts of players - and the more players, the more fun you'll have with these kind of easy games.

Players are commodity dealers, buying and selling for their Maharajah.  Lightning quick two player melding game, where players are either drawing/exchanging cards with a market pool on the table, or cashing in melds for different sets of victory points.  The treasures require more melded cards but are worth more points.  Round ends when three sets are cleaned out, and total up your points.  Bonus points awarded for 3/4/5 card melds and collecting camel cards.  Play best of three rounds.  Easy to teach, probably plays out in 20 minutes.  Very enjoyable two player filler.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun little game but it didn't blow me away.  At first it seemed like there wasn't enough tension, but the tension grew in the second round when we paid closer attention to which point tokens were remaining and what they were worth.  One thing I appreciated was how easy the game was to learn.  It plays quickly as well.  I liked it, but I'm having trouble finding specific things that I liked about it.

Update: After a second playing, it still feels like something is missing, and I've lowered the rating. The decision making is quite simple, there isn't a lot of strategy, and there is a fair amount of luck influencing the outcome. It's not a bad game, and it's cute, but it's just not interesting enough.  There are too many other 2 player games that we like to play, so I've put this up for trade.

RATING: 7.45
A perfect balance of luck, strategy, and camels. The game moves at a fast pace and has high replayability.

My main gripe with the game is actually the box. If you store it sideways, the chips start to stand upright and push the lid open. But if that is the worst thing about this game, obviously it is doing pretty good.

This is a fun card game for 2 players. Basically you take turns going back and forth either buying or selling (but never both) each turn until one player amasses enough points to win the round, and the winner of the game is best 2 out of three rounds. I really like the card art, and I like how the game plays, not too complicated, but with enough strategy to keep it interesting. The big thing about this game is the decision each round to buy or sell. At first, its pretty obvious, you want to buy to get some good cards, BUT, the first person to buy into each set of goods gets most of the high point markers, so just waiting one turn could cost you a lot of points. Each turn you don't buy is another turn your opponent can buy and take a huge lead, but at the same time, each turn you buy means another couple of turns building your hand back up so that you can buy again. Fun game, I don't think its one you master right off the bat.

Nice box and could be played in a restaurant, pub or cafe with a significant other. I would rather play star realms as a portable game over this, but this is a shorter game which could be an advantage.

Cards with six different gems are traded in for stacks of VP tokens, each with a different distribution of values. Everything revolves around how cards are picked up and managed in hand. Choosing the right time to trade, or forcing opponents to trade really matters. Camel cards add an interesting hold mechanic, refusing to reveal new cards from the deck for opponents to snatch up. A lot of tense ebb and flow to hand management between experienced players.

Jaipur is a 2-player game of trading, tempo, and set collection. You don't trade with your opponent. Rather, you trade with a row of cards accessible to both players. Cards come in 2 varieties: goods and camels. Camels are useful because they don't clog up your hand limit of cards and a majority of them at the end of the round provides a scoring bonus. On your turn you can either sell goods, or acquire cards. When you sell cards, you can only sell one type of good, but as many of that type as you want (though half of the good types require a minimum of 2 goods). The game has incentives to sell early (a good's value decrease as goods sell) and to wait (selling more cards at once provide you bonus chips with is worth additional points). When acquiring cards, you can either take 1 good, all camels, or trade goods/camels you own for goods in the center. The danger of taking cards (particularly multiple camels) is that you could be giving the opponent the cards they need. You play the best 2 of 3 rounds. It's quick, easy to explain, but has interesting decisions and unique gameplay. Definitely a good lighter game recommended for couples.

Luck is present, but the camels are a surprisingly useful luck mitigation tool, and create wonderful decisions throughout the game. Should you pick up the 4 Camel cards, and allow yourself great flexibility later in the game, or should you leave them in the market and allow your opponent to open up the market for you? In a similar way, the timing of selling your cards is crucial, as an small early sale of leather, can easily trump a larger one later in the game. A must buy for any two-player fan.

Jaipur is a harmless, fast playing game for two. It's your classic 'on your turn you can do this or that, but not both' game. The set collection aspect is simple and effective. Overall I think it's a likable title, but there's nothing there that really endears me to the game. The set up is a little more tedious than the average cards-only 2p game, but only by a little. If you like Lost Cities and you value card art and general game display, this is a title that may interest you.   

I ended up trading this title away. In the end, I did find the game interesting, and probably better than most 2p games, BUT the setup was a real dealbreaker.

There is a repetitiveness to this game that I find quite boring.  Another reviewer called it a "stand-off", which is a perfect description.  It's a boring, bland, parcheesiesque stand-off.  Lowering to a 5 -- can't play it anymore.  Sobek is a much better offering.

Back to 6.  It's OK.

A great 2 player game. Set up and clean up is too long due to the chips. It kind of evokes a miniature Ticket to Ride experience, since you are either collecting the color cards you need or turning in those cards for points. And you always wonder if your opponent is going to claim your objective before you are. 

*Update: I really enjoy playing this one on boardgamearena. Much more fun when you don't have to set up.

After having played Jaipur 60+ times, I think the sheen of it has worn off a little bit. I'd rank it a 9 for my first fifty games, but by now the motions have become a little bit repetitive -- hence my rating of 8. Don't let that put you off from trying this wonderful game, though! Jaipur is a fantastic two-player game with quite a bit of strategy and a dose of luck. It's more fun than Lost Cities and has more options for winning. There's a fair amount of screwage, and the semi-random bonus tiles add a needed amount of uncertainty to the scoring. Jaipur easily plays in half an hour, and it doesn't outstay its welcome. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Jaipur is a game that forces you, as many tight two-player games do, to weigh each decision you make. When to collect, when to trade in, when to break down and take all the camels.... I find it a greater challenge to choose than I expected.

The game conceals the depth of its decision-making, for the actions themselves are few and simple.

I've found, after many plays, that scores are usually tight. This is not a game of one-sided blowouts.

RATING: 6
This is a clever 2P card game that has some very nice considerations that keep it from feeling zero sum. It's a set collection race where, on your turn, you can either take cards or turn them in for VPs. You gotta make sure you turn in your cards before the round ends else they don't count. 

The thrust of the game is the way you may replace cards you take with cards you have. Some of the cards you have may be camel cards that don't contribute to the sets you're trying to make but simply serve as replacements. Ha, take that, opponent! They do at least, however, confer a 5VP bonus to whomever ends up with the most at the end of the round.

Sometimes you may go for the higher value sets or you may go for a bunch of lower value ones and the camels. What you take and what you leave for your opponent are both important considerations. 

Clever game. You play best of 3 rounds.

First modern card game I ever played in full.

I love, love, love:
- the equal pressure on making bigger sets but not missing out on higher-point tokens
- the camels being kinda useless but so helpful as ways to trip up your opponent
- the artwork

I dislike:
- maybe that it's a best of three game?

Final verdict: A solid small-box game that plays quickly but doesn't really need to be a best-of-three game; this seems to have been done just to draw out the game, and it's not necessary or thematic to me.

The choices between taking, trading, or selling cards offers a nice "cat-and-mouse" chase with your opponent as you fight to collect sets for the highest bonuses. The camel cards are a neat addition to this kind of card drafting game. They provide good flexibility for shaping your hand, but you risk revealing higher valued cards for your opponent to snatch up when taking them.

Initially this game seems to be all about the camels and I suspect camel denial is a stategy you could play however whilst camels give you more options and more cards in hand they don't actually score you any points.

The hand limit of 7 cards + camels is what makes this game as otherwise it would be a set collection game with very little going for it, however sometimes you are forced to return a ruby (for example) to the centre because you NEED the leather cards to reach 5 and thus score bonus points.

Three rounds is a good amount and games tend to be close.

Underwhelmed. It's OK for what it is, but it's not all that. Very simple rules, easy card management, and some timing decisions. But I suspect luck in the draw matters too much. 

***

Played again, got hammered, again feel luck of the draw is too much. If the right card pops up for your opponent, there's nothing you can do. Watch them take it, watch them take the best scores next turn, curse your bad fortune. Maybe I could play it better, keener, but I'm not sure the game is worth that much effort.

This is one of the best (if not THE best) 2-player card games around.  For 3 simple rules, this gem packs so much thought & depth - and is a lot of fun to play.  Besides, who doesn't like camels?  Lost Cities may have just gotten "fired" for top slot on best favorite card game with the GF/spouse.  A surprise hit that may also qualify as a "gateway" game.  Grade: B

A colorful, quick, easy-rules card game that has some strategy.  Luck involves which cards are turned up, but the strategy lies in whether you decide to pick-up, trade, or sell cards, and control of your hand size.  It is different enough from other card games (and I have a lot), that I am glad I have it.  

A very good game filler while you are waiting for late comers to arrive.  

I believe the 12+ age on the box is ridiculously high.  Certainly some of the strategy would bypass a 6-year old, nevertheless I see no reason not to introduce it at that age.

Jaipur is a card game representing a contest between two traders to see who can get richer.

[u]Overview[/u]
Players start with five randomly dealt cards. Camels always go into the herd and goods form a player's hand (maximum size: 7 goods). Five cards are placed on the board, forming the market; all the other cards form the deck. Every turn a player can draw all the camels on the market (replacing them with new cards from the deck), exchange cards with the market (taking 2+ goods and replacing them with cards not of the same kinds), draw a single good from the market (replacing it with a new card from the deck) or sell goods of a single kind for rupees. If a group of three or more goods is sold at once, the seller gets a bonus. The goods' value is represented by the good tokens and decreases as more of them are sold. When there are no tokens left for three different goods, or when the market cannot be refilled because the deck is empty, the round ends. The player who has more rupees from sales and bonuses wins the round. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
The rules are simple and promising, but towards the end most close rounds tend to grind to a halt, because nobody wants to risk exposing cards that would benefit their opponent. This means both players will try to burn as many turns as possible while doing almost nothing in order to force their opponent to reveal a new card which, if they're lucky or unless they're unlucky, will let them score big (or block their opponent) and win the round.

This is caused by too much information being available: you know exactly (from the tokens) what has been sold, you know what your opponent has drawn recently and everything else can only be in the deck. When the deck gets thin you know how likely it is for you to reveal a bad card, so you start wasting turns to avoid doing that. This could have been solved by adding one more card for each good and removing some of them randomly at the beginning of every round.

Hoarding goods of a kind to sell them for a higher bonus is better after the goods' value drops; camels grant a lot of flexibility and shouldn't be ignored; exchanging cards with the market is improved by having camels and is a nice way to get goods you want without revealing new cards; timing is key: for example, groups of camels on the market should be taken when the opponent is unable to profit from the goods that will be revealed (usually because of the hand limit or of having no camels); often at the beginning of the game it is worth to sell just one or two cards of a good and losing out on the bonus if you know your opponent is hoarding them, in order to drive down the price.

It’s a cute little card game that strikes me as being in the same vein as Traders of Carthage or R-Eco.  It’s a bit more bland than I was hoping for, and many of the decisions do seem obvious after a while, but it’s still an enjoyable experience for 1 or 2 rounds. It’s when it goes to a 3rd round (assuming each player won one of the first two) that I feel like it’s gone on long enough and I start itching to do something else..

2 de junio de 2014 > Baja de 7.5 a 6.5. El juego es simploncillo, piscinero.

Dic de 2015 - Juego para dos agradable de jugar y muy bonito, con componentes muy chulos. Cuando lo compré lo estuve jugando incluso en algún que otro bar con Reyes, y me gustó pero no me mató, probablemente porque me recordaba demasiado a los juegos de naipes tradicionales y por aquella época los valoraba muy poco. Hoy día, mucho más interesado en estos juegos sencillos pero inteligentes de cartas me atraen mucho más y tengo ganas de recuperarlo y volverlo a jugar para ver si mejoran las sensaciones.

Egyszerű, gyors, könnyed kétszemélyes kártyajáték. Termékeket és tevéket kell benne szereznünk, kb. 3 perc alatt elmagyarázható szabályok alapján. Szerintem sokkal jobb, mint a hasonló Lost Cities.
Egyetlen hátránya, a nehézkes setup, ugyanis nagyon meg kell keverni a lapokat a party-k között.

RATING: 7
If you're looking for inspiration on how to achieve a lot with very little, Jaipur is a very good example. With only a stack of cards, a couple of bonus chits and a set of rules that you could almost fit on a coaster there is still a very compelling game in the box.

Players are trading sets of goods cards for bonus chits, and always need to weigh immediate benefits against possibly higher benefits later on - provided the other player doesn't cash in first and grabs most of the high value chits which would handily ruin those nice bonus profits.

It's short, it's light, simply a very good game for two all around.

Jaipur is a perennial love around my home. Ever since I bought it on a whim it's been a solid addition to our game collection. The game tends to run cold sometimes, but there are moments of beautiful tension mostly.

[2014.11.26]
A game that I've falling in love with mid-way through the first game (which I somehow won).  It's not terribly deep, can run cold, and luck can at times play a big factor, but it's great fun and filled with exquisite moments of "beautiful tension."

Good 2-player card game.   Plays in a half-hour, just enough planning and interaction to maintain interest but still very light.

Update - After 12 plays, my wife and I are still seeing our tactics evolving and find the game more interactive.  There are certainly a lot of cases where the optimal play is obvious, but we've found there  are a few tough decisions to be made every round.

Update:  Played ~10 games on BGA and found the better players beat me every time where I beat average players almost every time, so there's even more skill to this game than it might appear.

Excellent two-player game - as good as the hype.  This is one that definitely a great couples game. If you are a fan of Lost Cities, I think you would enjoy this one as it provides the same kind of ease-of-play and flow that LC provides.  Beautiful art, smart mechanics and a perfect balance between luck and solid decision making. I'm usually more critical of a game that requires you to play it three times over in order to determine a winner, but it doesn't overly hamper the game. Happy to have this in my collection as it is unlike any other game I own of this type.

RATING: 5.5
Initially a fun racey trading game, but it plays itself out really quickly - repetitious play with only a few real decisions means we only got about 15 plays of it before it got stale - compared to battle line and lost cities that still offer fun, fresh challenges ever after 50+ plays.

Jaipur er et solidt to-spillers spil, der har fået en positiv modtagelse og som også falder fint i min smag. Det er et oplagt spil i kategorien kærestespil for selvom der er handel og det går ud på at sikre sig de bedste varer og hurtigst muligt få lavet nogle lukrative handler inden priserne daler, så er det så godt justeret, at de spil vil har spillet er endt overraskende tæt. I spillet erhverver man sig forskellige varer, hvor nogle er mere lukrative end andre, priserne daler efterhånden som der er blevet solgt varer af en bestemt type og man belønnes for at sælge store mængder af samme type vare. Man kan i sin tur vælge enten at sælge eller at købe varer. Køber man varer har man lov til enten at tage en vare blandt dem, der ligger fremme på bordet eller at bytte så mange man vil. Da man samler varer sammen på hånden og samtidig har en øvre grænse for hvor mange varer man må have på hånden, er det nødvendigt ind imellem at få solgt ud af de varer man har på hånden. Hvis man sidder med en hel hånd af kort, man har samlet, kan modstanderen med en smule held og eller omtanke sørge for at store dele af markedet bliver udskiftet uden at man har mulighed for at erhverve sig disse, da det ville betyde, at man måtte skaffe sig af med de varer, man slidsomt har skrabet sammen. Så timing betyder meget i spillet. Udover varer er der yderligere en korttype: Kameler. Kameler lægger man i en bunke foran sig på bordet. Den fungerer som en udvidet hånd, der ikke tæller med, når man tæller op, hvor mange kort man har på hånden. Kamelerne kan man dog også anvende til at bytte for varer, så selvom man lige har solgt alle de varer man havde på hånden, betyder det ikke nødvendigvis, at man ikke kan foretage store indkøb på markedet. Afslutningsvis er der en bonus for at have flest kameler i sin bunke. Bunken med kameler er i mine øjne det twist, der før Jaipur interessant. Et par ting gør dog, at det næppe kommer særlig ofte på bordet hos os; dels er jeg nok den, der syntes bedst om spillet og det begrænser jo brugen, hvis det skal anvendes som kærestespil og dels har vi mange andre to-spillers spil som jeg trods alt også finder er langt mere interessante end Jaipur. Men det betyder langt fra, at jeg ikke vil anbefale spillet. En lille detalje der irriterer mig ved spillet er, at reglerne foreskriver, at man skal spille spille indtil en spiller har vundet to spil uden at score dog overføres fra spil til spil. Det behøver man selvfølgelig ikke gøre, men i mine øjne er det en unødvendig forskrift på hvordan spillet skal spilles, når nu der i øvrigt ikke overføres nogen form for status fra det ene spil til det næste.

I like the fact this game is easy to take with me wherever I go, easy to teach, great for family and fast to play. It is colourful and I enjoy the push-your-luck kind of mechanics. The player interaction is elegant and is not too aggressive, yet does not feel solitary.
I just regret the lack of depth of this game, which hinders replayability a little bit.

Jaipur reminds me a little of Biblios in that it's set collection where you must sacrifice and surrender assets in hopes of creating bigger and better sets. The coin chits have a nice tactile quality and lend to the marketplace feel. A joy of a 2-player-only game and I have a feeling this will see many repeated plays.

Jaipur is a simple economy/trading game for two players. It's is a lot of fun, once you get the hang of it.

Really a game about timing the market: when to take camels, when to sell, how long to hold out for more goods. Seeing what your opponent takes gives information about their hand that you can try to exploit, but taking cards yourself sets up the market for your opponent. Resetting the chips between rounds is takes longer than I would like, and feels disruptive to the flow of the game. A riskier-feeling alternative to Lost Cities.

This looked promising based on the BGG reviews, but it turns out it's VERY light with mostly obvious decisions.  The game kind of plays itself once you learn the basic tactics - which takes one game at the most.

For a short and simple two-player card game, I'd much rather play Schotten Totten (Battle Line), Lost Cities, Kupferkessel Co, or several others.

The Egyptian cartoon theme is tasteful, the game parts are pretty cool and easy to store in the box (thanks to the intelligent thermoforming). In spite of a part of strong randoming system, playing characters abilities at the right time can change the face of the round, just be patient, but no too! Also, the corruption system is very interesting, will you yield to temptation of the corruption? sometimes you won't have the choice... and that's very frustrating... In conclusion a very good game for 2 players, fast and free flowing, with a good interaction between players, but not always fair due to its random system.

After playing Jaipur, I realized why it's on the list of everyone's top 10 for 2 player game.

Even though there is a slight luck involved in the game, the game does have a tiny amount of strategy in terms of selecting cards. The camel cards and how it plays is really nice, where you have to take all the camels or none. It might seem like an advantage in the beginning but having a lot of camel herd can be anti-climatic for certain scenarios.

It's very simple, easy to teach, well made and I think a peaceful game :)

If you want to introduce your spouse to board-gaming slowly, dose-by-dose and ramp up the complexity, then Jaipur is a good start for that. And even then, down the line, you will still take it out to play. 

Really like the game.

Nice little 2-player game. It takes about 15 minutes to play, though the rules tell you to play it 2-3 times, so figure about 30 to 45 minutes. In a nutshell, every turn you draw cards to make sets of 2,3,4,or 5 of a kind, or you sell those sets to get victory points. You can also get a +5 bonus if you have the most camels. That's pretty much it. It's a nice game with broad appeal, nice components, and generally recommended.

A great two-player trading game. Each player collects sets of cards representing different goods. Depending how large your set is, you can get bonus points. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of each good, and their value decreases the longer you wait. So, do you take few goods now for higher value, or risk gathering a larger set for less points but a larger bonus? Excellent give and take decisions in a relatively short amount of time.

RATING: 5
Jaipur is a quick playing push your luck set collection game. Players collect sets of each color and must choose either to build a larger set for larger profit or sell early to ensure collection of the limited available points tokens. On the downside, setup has a few too many pieces for the type of game. Each resource and bonus has a stack and each stack needs to be stacked sequentially. It is small, but for the speed of the game, setup time stands out as too long. As for strategy, interesting decisions boil down to whether take camel control and risk newly revealed cards benefiting your opponent or take one card and limit that risk. Rummy style two player card games appear quite often. Among those, Jaipur is good, but doesn't have the greatness of others. What hold it back the most from seeing several plays is the somewhat tedious setup. As of now, the electronic implementation of Jaipur is lovely, but on the table, less so.

"Best of 3" mode still clocks in at around 30 minutes. It's a game that allows for a more social experience. In that it's fast and easy enough to play that you can actually have a conversation with your fellow player, if that makes sense.

Jaipur is a light-hearted little card game for the casual players with a mechanic that resembles Ticket to Ride quite a bit.

Very good two player filler game.  Im thinking the replayability is zero but for what it is, a super light filler you can play with anyone.  Most hands play themselves but you do get a few good push your luck decisions and when you decide to take camels can be vital to your success.  BUT a decision-heavy game it isn't, even during your first game the decisions will seem very very obvious.

 A good "intro" to gaming game, or something you can drag off the shelf when a friend visits and says "what are all these games" because it teaches in two minutes, plays quick, etc.  

I like it for what it is - if you go in with the wrong expectations you will not like it.

Pretty nifty set collection deal for two. Each player trades with a common pool of cards, so what you toss may appeal to your opponent. Special camel cards are relatively low value, but give you more trading power. There's also a very cool balancing act to be done-- grabbing the early valuable tokens is tempting, but turning in more at once is also rewarded. Grab the good stuff now or wait and risk losing it? Light but satisfying.

Jaipur is a marketplace trading game, with fast paced put and take, set collection and hand management.

Nice game, looks good, it has CAMELS, awesome!

But...
It is way too fiddly and long to set up for such a short game.

I really want to like it more but no one ever wants to set it up the first time or for round 2.

I don’t mind a long setup time for a game but then the game needs to last an hour or so.

Gran juego para dos jugadores. Las partidas son rápidas y divertidas. Desde luego, hay un factor de azar, pero, a menos que los planetas se hayan alineado en tu contra, no es decisivo: gana quien mejor juega sus cartas.

A grandes rasgos, el juego consiste en hacerse con mercancías. No todas son igual de valiosas e influye la cantidad que acumulas: vender 3, 4 ó 5 proporciona valiosos bonus. Pero la clave está en forzar al contrario a robar todas las cartas de la mesa, lo que aumenta las posibilidades propias de obtener las mejores mercancías.

En definitiva, un buen juego para dos, con reglas sencillas, fácil preparación, agradable de jugar y reñido cuando se adquiere cierta experiencia.

Jaipur is a quick and simple hand management / set collection game and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it if that's what you're looking for.

Each turn a player either sells cards for points or buys cards.  Because both players are buying from the same market any buy action provides opportunities for the opponent. Selling provides tension between speed and quantity.

This is a really cool little two-player card game.  It's a rummy variant insofar as players are trying to make sets and need to discard to a shared area where their opponent can pick up the cards they put down, but unlike, say, Lost Cities, it has a distinctive flavor of its own.  I enjoyed the brinksmanship of trying to save up for a token that your opponent may also be saving for. The camels are also a neat touch; they can serve as a wild card, but having more than your opponent is also worth points. I think the Spiel has it right when they say this feels like a traditional card game without feeling like a traditional card game that already existed.  (1 play)

Jaipur is an outstanding game that makes a trading theme for 2 players super fun. You have to play the market (i.e. take cards from the spread) to collect sets and trade them in for chips for those goods. The more and earlier you trade, the better return you get for those goods. There’s some tactics, a little risk and pushing your luck, and it’s so fun trying to beat your opponent to the better rewards! I guarantee you’ll be playing back to back games of Jaipur.

La idea del juego es muy sencilla y está ambientada en un mercado de la ciudad oriental de Jaipur. Hay una serie de cartas disponibles en la mesa que representan mercancías y camellos. Puedes comerciar (tomar dos o más cartas y reemplazarlas por las que tuvieras en tu mano y/o por camellos que tuvieras en tu poder), comprarlas (tomas una mercancía y la reemplazas por otra carta del mazo de robo) o sencillamente, tomas todos los camellos que haya en la muestra (y dejas en su lugar cartas extraídas del mazo de robo). A la vez, tienes que tratar de cumplir el objetivo del juego, que consiste en hacer "familias" (sets) de cartas de la misma mercancía y venderlos para conseguir tantos puntos como mercancías vendas,(una ficha con forma de moneda) y, si vendes los suficientes (3 o más), un bonus por haberlo hecho. La gracia está en que el valor de las monedas que tomas, va decreciendo y además, no hay para los dos jugadores, así que vender las mismas mercancías conforme avanza el juego, te reporta cada vez menos puntos.

PROS: El límite de 7 cartas en la mano, los bonus por vender 3 o + mercancías, los 5 PV´s al que más camellos tenga... le añaden mucha más tensión de la que podría esperarse en un juego a 2.

CONS: Quizá demasiado simple. Dosis de azar.

Un buen juego para 2 que es una mezcla de Euro y juego de cartas tradicional.

Always introduced as the ideal "couples game", I got it get my spouse more invested in our game collection. We now have ten logged plays on BGStats and we are evenly split 5-5! This game has become a staple in our house. It's fast enough just to pick it up and pass the time. It's strategic enough that it never gets boring. It does take a fair amount of table space so don't expect to play it on an airplane. I think the only thing keeping me from rating this a 10 is that I still lust after other two player games like 7 Wonders Duel or Agricola: Animals Big and Small. I think, if I could get these out of my system, this could be a perfect game for me that I could always want when we sit down.

A stunning 2 player-only game in which you are trading different commodities for points.  The game plays very simply but contains a surprising amount of strategy - a large part of which stems from the use of camel cards, which you cannot sell but only trade in return for other available cards.  The fact you have a hand limit, along with a few other factors, make this a very interesting and highly competitive game.

The game looks beautiful, comes in a small box, and is perfect for playing with your SO.  Highly recommended.

I've introduced this to a lot of people and they all enjoyed it. Very good 2p game, maybe my favorite.  Lots of potential for strategy, but simple to learn. Some luck involved, but not too much. my rating keeps creeping up

competitive but not adversarial. The decisions you have made give your an opponent an advantage or disadvantage but you KNOW ahead of time what risk you're taking. There isn't any real "take that" about it, so it doesn't feel mean at all. It DOES have brutally tough decisions despite being a nice quick game that is easy to learn. Also, it's cheap.  Definitely my go-to 2 player game.

An excellent compact trading game for two players. It is surprisingly engaging for a relatively simple card game, whilst still fast playing. Each turn counts, with players needing to optimise their collection and trading of leather, silk and other wares. Adapting strategy to the turn of the cards and decisions of the other player makes for an enjoyable challenge. Elegant, ‘thinky-but-light’, portable and aesthetically pleasing – a real benchmark for small-box games.

Jaipur is a solid if not slightly-simplistic two-player game. There's not a lot of strategy, but there the luck-pushing elements of its mechanics are fun.

Quick (20-30 min) set collecting game with little direct conflict. Very safe for non-confrontational gamers. All together it's a great two player option, but lacks the depth of something like Omen. 

This game fits in the same feeling/time as Utopian Rummy.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2012)

Initially I really liked this game, nowadays I have cooled a little toward it. This is a good family game, with simple rules but with some interesting/hard decisions, still it is a bit light for my taste. The game flows rather quickly and my GF loves it so I don’t think I will sell it. The theme is paper thin for me.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0 so it matches the BGG recommendation system with my new feelings for the game. 

Jaipur is great to initiate new gamers to our hobby or to play with your family.

After lots of more plays, I’m downgrading Jaipur´s rating again. It just has a lot of uncontrollable luck in it and now it bothers me a lot, It has some interesting decisions, but luck decides the winner 80% of the time. The only reason I don’t sell it is because my GF loves the game and request it often. Gorgeous components though.

My favorite two-player game of all time.  The reward distribution and role of the camels in this game make for the perfect 15 minute game.  Playing best out of the three is also brilliant as one player can sometimes get lucky with the draws and edge out a better player.  My only quip is the reward tokens, as much as I like the way they look, I think I would have preferred cards which would make this game much more portable.

My kingdom for a camel. Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja. At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points.

RATING: 7.5
2015-05-21: Initial rating as 7, but it really feels like somewhere between 7 and 8. The game is so subtle. It feels like you are really getting the luck-of-the-draw, but what you do with the choices and timing you have can really make a difference. The non-combative nature of the game really set a nice tone and was very casual and enjoyable. Most annoying thing is the scoring and setup between rounds, but can be achieved within a minute and is perfectly acceptable.

RATING: 7
One of the better small-box two-player games I've played. It plays quick and you have judgement calls to make every turn. The game is almost entirely tactical since you won't know really what you'll have to work with on your turn, but staying flexible is the key to enjoying this game.

UPDATE 8/15: I've since acquired the game and started playing it with my 8-year-old daughter, and we can have competitive games. So I'd say the 12+ age on the box is incorrect. I think the reason for this is that every turn you take an action that helps you. There are no bad choices, just good, better, and best. Make more best choices than good choices and you'll win. My daughter was at first too enamoured with having a big herd, but she's quickly seeing that a herd is there to be used, not hoarded!

I always enjoy a game of this, and the components are beautiful but it has lost a bit of its shine. I think I prefer games where something is built or develops throughout play. I feel a standard card game like cribbage or similar could replace this.

After 1 game on Yucata, I find it fun, but possibly too much luck.
My score in Round 1 (which I won) was 69, but I hadn't read the rules and had no idea what I was doing.
My score in Round 3 (which I lost) was 66, and by then I had read the rules and was trying to play strategically.

7.2 rating for now, if strategy turns out to be more important, I'll raise the rating, if it does turn out to be so luck heavy, I'll probably lower the rating...

Great two-player set collection game and hand management economic filler that plays in about 15 minutes.  

The economic aspect of this game forces you to make some risk/reward trade offs.  Do you get your goods to market to get the higher price, or do you wait to get a larger collection and receive a market receive bonus?  Do you grab the herd of camels that can help you later, but may provide your opponent the goods they need now?  

My wife enjoys this one which is always a plus.

About as light as a 2P cardgame can be without being a waste of time. Jaipur is perfectly fine as a wind-down game or a short break. Two players are drawing cards from an available row of 5 and then cashing them in. The game is all about controlling the card row. You want your opponent's choices to be as poor as possible.

It's probably the odd colour mix that kept me from Jaipur so far which would have been a pity as I would have missed a really good two-player game. Naturally, it has to bear the comparison with Jambo as another two-player game of becoming the richest trader. While Jambo is the deeper game and leaves more to explore, Jaipur scores with ease of gameplay while still leaving plenty of decisions. Players have to weigh the benefit of scoring now for safe points or later for more risky higher points that in the worst case might not materialize at all. Recommended and I might seek this out for my collection.

RATING: 8
This card game may have the best cards I've ever played with. They feel great to shuffle, look wonderful, and they keep it simple. No rule in the game feels fiddly, but there are a couple that feel mechanical in a way that subtly detracts from the theme. Overall, one of the best two player games we own. My wife really likes this one, and it has the right amount of luck, mediated by the "market" similar to Ticket to Ride.

This was my first 2-player-only game, and I still feel it was a great choice. It doesn't get played as often as my other games, but every now and then my wife and I will decide to have a go. It can be very down to luck-of-the-draw, but multiple plays tend to iron that out quite well. And the components + artwork are wonderful, especially for the size of the game.

Definitely nothing unique, but a fun little 2-player game to put into rotation.  The main idea of the game rests on timing with the elephants.  There is a huge amount of luck in the cards that get revealed, and over three rounds, it should even out.  But you can control how many cards get revealed, so you can mediate the luck.  I like how quickly it plays, but be prepared for some serious addition at the end of each round.

 A delightful game in which you can trade and collect goods. There is a good amount of luck involved but there is enough room for tactics and strategy as to which good(s) you are trying to collect and how much you try to stop your opponent getting the goods he wants. The game is interactive as you have to keep track of what your opponent is collecting. Very easy to teach as the rules are simple. A great game to play with kids.

Do you like the idea of random VP bonuses for trading in sets of cards? E.g. - I trade a 3 card set and you trade a 3 card set. My bonus chip is worth double yours, because....it just is. Don't ask questions. Cool.

In Jaipur, there's push your luck in how long to wait before cashing in a set, there's denial in what you leave on the table, there's different strategies, and player-controlled ending. It's got just enough tension and confrontation to call each other names, but not enough to sour the experience. A nice little game to play when we're waiting for other players to arrive.

I play this with my wife a fair bit. Currently my favorite game that we play together. It has a very nice flow to it, albeit with the odd hiccup that slows the game down. The lady of the house says it's a bit too intense for repeat play so it'll only hit the table once in a 2hr session (our usual time for games).

This is the perfect 2 player game. There is strategy, luck(so that the less experienced player also has a chance),huge moments when 5 camels are taken and a clever scoring system where goods start off with higher values and descend from that point on. The rule of not being able to sell singles of the valuable resources is also genius since it forces you to manage your hand efficiently. I quite like it even though I don't own it but I see myself getting it soon.

Simple two-player game of set-collection where you compete to sell sets of goods in batches as large as you can for point chips and bonuses for large sales.  Trade with a market using goods from your hands or from your herd of camels.  This game is easy enough to play with children, but is still interesting for adults.  Also, everyone loves camels!  :-D

Based on one play.  This is a fun little card game and I can understand the appeal.  I expect it could take some time if you play the full three rounds but the decision can always be made to play only one.  However, for me I wonder how long the appeal would last over several plays.  I'm willing to play this but I don't see this getting added to my collection.

A nice little game with attractive, high quality components. It is quick to pick up and play.

There is a fair bit of luck in the fall of the cards, however there are interesting dynamics in how you can try to force the market against your opponent.

This is done through the manipulation of the camel herds, or use of low value cards, to acquire better cards in the market place -- you run the risk that by sweeping the market, an even better set of cards will be revealed from the draw pile.

There is also an important strategy in how you control the end of the game, which happens either when three commodities are exhausted, or the draw pile runs out. Selling your collected commodities is a turn, so you have to make sure the game lasts long enough to sell all you have in hand.

Overall it is not an awesome game, but it is a nice game and plays quickly enough that the lack of serious depth is not to its detriment.

Jaipur is an easy-to-learn and yet challenging two-player family filler. It kicked Lost Cities right off the shelf, because of its superior gameplay and less convoluted scoring. The game is all about taking calculated risks and seeing whether or not they pay off. It is so easy to learn, and yet the gameplay is extremely satisfying, even for my friends who enjoy complex Eurogames. Its portability is a plus, as well.

Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan. You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city.

But that's not enough for you, because only the merchant with two Seals of Excellence will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court.

You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.

RATING: 8
Fun game - fast - a couple of tricks with the camels can make all the difference. The card deal makes a difference but is countered by the random points on the collection boost counters. There are some different strategies you can apply - probably four at the most - quite enough to make it interesting to keep playing.  A quick, fun game with a camel twist that is worth playing for two full games - six rounds.

There's a lot more to Jaipur than players often credit, especially those who've only played against one or two players, and not seen what 'higher level' play can involve.

Jaipur is a game of card counting, (mis)representation, timing, and positioning. Understanding the implications between the mechanics of camels, trading, and other cards is the unique element that makes the game interesting.

Knowing what your opponent is looking for or has is one of the primary factors in consideration as to camel and trade timing, and successfully bluffing in these moments can be decisive. Knowing when to sell un-optimally order to cut your opponent and gain the better draw position is as tricky to determine as knowing when to stop looking for a card you were chasing in order to switch out for a 5 card opportunity.

Knowing how to play an opponent with 1 card in hard and no camels is easy, but knowing how to play one with 1 card in hard and three camels it more interesting, and knowing how to play when they have 7 cards is also interesting.

And, despite all the above, the game has significant variance, enabling any player to win on their day, and often win at least one of three rounds in a loss, making it more fun and enjoyable for all players, not just the one that is better at it.

I don’t get a lot of mileage out of two-player games these days, but everyone I’ve played this one with seems to have enjoyed it, and it’s getting some talk as the game which may finally overthrow Lost Cities as the ultimate two-player spouse-friendly game.

Meh. I wanted to like Jaipur as I find its colors pretty and I'd like more good two player games. Unfortunately it isn't very memorable. It's not that it's bad but it's not really good either. It's hard to fine tune your strategy as there is too much randomness in the scoring points so you end up playing conservatively most of the time, merely trying to avoid drawing a good card for your opponent. 
All the fooling around with the camels is fun but it is not enough to save the game. There just isn't enough tension and the game is too long to setup for what it is.

Easily learned but different every time, Jaipur has definitely earned its place as one of the great two-player games.  Its combo of set collecting and trading is dynamic and workable, and there's enough randomness to keep it interesting through multiple plays.  The scoring system is very clever and makes taking calculated risks worthwhile.

The design is good (a bit cartoonish, maybe), with a colorful palate and a nice layout.  Replay value is very high, even addictive; and the thematic elements are just good enough to not be abstract.  Overall a terrific game you'll love to play with your partner!

A game focused on set collection and trading, this easy-to-understand yet strategic card game features a push-your-luck aspect.

Due to all of the rave reviews, I got a copy of [thing=54043][/thing] for my wife's birthday.  It's positioned as one of those light card games that are great for two players.  In this case, both players are trying to collect sets of different goods before trading them in for money.  In this case, there's a common pool of cards that you have to trade with.  This gives the game a bit of subtle player interaction since you have to be careful what you leave behind in the common pool.  The camels are a unique resource that act almost like a safety valve.  There's also a sense of trying to cash in goods before the other player, but you're also rewarded with waiting by getting bonuses for three or more goods that you trade in at the same time (this mechanism felt a little like [thing=21790][/thing] to us).

We found it to be an okay game, almost slightly over-hyped here.  The interaction is subtle, although generally the right choice feels obvious.  Often, the gameplay feels more like avoiding opening up new cards for your opponent rather than taking cards for yourself.  The shortness of the game is defeated by the relatively long setup time---the chips are quite fiddly to organize and arrange.  I don't see this being as portable as other card games of similar weight.  For this reason alone, it probably won't supplant [thing=50][/thing] for us, but it also lacks the tension of [thing=50][/thing] as well.  Compared to [thing=31105][/thing], another set collection game with a common pool, [thing=54043][/thing] feels a little more mechanical and less fun.  Not a bad two player game, but probably not our first choice off the shelf.

RATING: 9
Very non-intuitive, the strategy.  But the game is simple enough that I can wrap my head around it.  

It pairs with the theme fairly well.  Very well when you consider how small of a game this is.

Mostly strategy, but a fair amount of luck in what cards come out when.  So far that doesn't bother me though.

Love the small footprint of the box.

Love that it's a 2-player game that has a fair amount of strategy, feels balanced, and a fair amount of theme.  Fills a very unique niche and I love that.

Components are good but certainly not stellar.

Mechanics are very simple while not limiting depth.  That's a great combo.

The only downside is that it feels hard to know how to get ahead.  But there are strategies to learn, they just aren't necessarily intuitive.  Like when to get camels--not as obvious as you think.  It depends on how full your opponent's hand is.

Normally when player interaction is just done through "if I buy this you can't" I'm not a fan.  In this case it's also "if I sell this you can't."  And in this, buying things so someone else can't is like the whole game, so the fact that this is the focus and drive makes the game very enjoyable to me actually.  I get a very particular feeling from playing this game and I like that.

An easy to learn filler that is reasonably thinky, as every action you do has the possibility of helping your opponent out more (revealing new cards etc.). There's a balance beween collecting large sets to get the bonus and trading in your cards early because the earlier points chips are higher. However, not very thematic and not anything to write home about.

1) You may only have 7 cards in your hand at the end of your turn.
2) You may exchange with the market using cards from your hand and *also* cards from your camel herd.

 I was interested in getting was a short 2 player game for a filler or just a light quick game before bed time. We got Parade last year and it filled it admirably, but some variety was desired. This (along with Biblios) is one of the most recommended games I've seen for that type of situation, so I picked it up. My pre-purchase unfounded prejudice this time was that it would, as a 2 player trading game, be too much like Jambo, which was utterly wrong. While Jambo always feels constrained - in a how do I get all the goods I need for this sale together in my limited space way - Jaipur feels very airy and open: buy or sell, pick one, swap a few. Turns are quick and we are certainly playing quite loosely. Is there a deeper strategy? Perhaps. Making use of camels and countering your opponents moves are certainly things we could improve upon. Another that looks like it is perfect for its purpose.

I think the issue is the theming is not really connected ie why are you taking all the camels (maybe they follow the herd?) why can't you take all the goods (maybe can't carry but I have all these camels) . If you have someone thinking like this then makes the game difficult to play.

Attractive components, and easy-to-learn rules; I foresee this replacing Lost Cities as the default recommendation for people to lure their non-gaming partners into the hobby. I thoroughly enjoy this game, but I must say that I do begin to wonder whether it's skill, or luck, that plays a bigger part in the outcome; in our games, my wife and I are tied for wins/losses, and so far, every game has gone for three rounds (the game uses best-of-three to determine the winner). Nevertheless, if it happens that luck is a huge factor, that's okay, because it certainly doesn't feel that way when you're playing.

Update: I think I was right about this replacing Lost Cities. This still sees a lot of play in our house.

RATING: 8
Excellent card game.  Easy to learn, the cards have clear iconography and are beautiful to look at.  There is nothing that distracts from the essence of the game.  No strange or arcane rules to remember, only a simple and elegant mechanism.  There is an element of luck that is more like excitement.  In other words, although the game surprises and and has an element of push your luck, it still feels like you are playing the game (instead of the game playing you) and that you have many possible and viable strategies and choices you can make regardless of the luck of the draw.  The give and take, ebb and flow of cards, is original enough and very interesting.

A beautiful little game for two that offers quite a lot of decisions, given its pleasantly simple rules. The various wares on display are subtly distinguished from each other. For some, you’d prefer to get a whole set of them at once, for others, just skimming off the cream is worthwhile. What might make it great instead of very good would be some variation between the individual rounds you’re playing, but as it is, this is heartily recommended if your shelves are not already filled with pleasant two-player games.

There's a lot of luck involved, but also some hard decisions - like when to sell or draw more cards, how to handle camels etc.[/b]

I really like the gameplay of a single round, and the hidden scoring is always fun.  That alone would get the game an 8 from me.  But the fiddliness of having to essentially re-setup the game and sort all the tokens between rounds really becomes tedious and means that the game won't hit my table as much as it could.  For that reason, I dropped it a point.

Excellent fun and light 2-player game. By reading the rules I initially thought that it will not have any depth/strategy. However I was wrong, the "camels" mechanic introduces a considerable degree of decision making in the game. Great!

Rating based on 2 players.

A nice, small card game with a good mix of light strategy and luck (the strategy is trying to time your plays such that the "luck" can't help your opponent). The artwork is bright and engaging. One of the few games my mom will play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great 2-player game. One of my favorite parts of games is when the metagame starts to develop. Some games it takes a long time for the metagame to start to develop. You spend most of the time you play the game just getting used to it, that you don't have to time think about what could happen, or what your opponents might do if you do so and so. In Jaipur, the barrier to playing is so low that the metagame starts to develop in just your first play through. Every choice seems to obvious and the game starts to seem like it's boring, but then the metagame kicks in. You start wondering if picking up this obvious pile of camels is exactly what your opponent wants. It's a great game, that every couple should play through at least a couple of times.

Nice quick 2-player game.  Setup for each round can take a little time, but if both players work together (one shuffles, the other sets the coins), it's not difficult.  The gameplay is essentially an interesting tug-of-war over the game's economy.

RATING: 10
This is the best 2 player game I have ever played. The components are beautiful - artwork and quality are outstanding. The game plays true to theme, but not a slave to it. Instead you get a tightly designed game with excellent production value.

The core mechanic of trading cards with the market and swapping them in sets for chips is nice enough, but the addition of the camels makes this game shine. The camels introduce a timing element - when do I sell? When do I take the camels? How is my opponent's hand; if it's full I will do something markedly different than if it's empty.

Overall, the perfect blend of luck and strategy.

Excellent two player filler that isn't as deep as something like Biblios, but still has some tricky decisions, mostly in when to grab those darn camels.

In fact, the camel mechanism, which is basically a placeholder card you can take a group of and then later trade for valuable goods, is one of the most original mechanics I've seen in any game - I'd love to see it reappear in something heavier.

Excellent game!  Want to give it a few more plays before I actually rate it, but it should be somewhere around the 9/10 range.  Lots to like not the least of which is that goods tokens have points on the back making tallying points at the end a breeze...  For anyone who's ever played 'Lost Cities' you know exactly why this is a great addition.

4/17 -- Addendum
After multiple plays on BoardGameArena, my ranking of this game has waned slightly.  While there is strategy in when to grab goods, when to sell goods, and when to pick up camels, the luck involved can feel more variable than I'd like.  However, the game is particularly accessible and easily played within a short time frame; and therefore, will not be leaving my collection soon.  Solid 8 which I doubt will devolve further.

2p set collection game with very good flow. I like this better than Morels. Only problem is difficult shuffling due to set nature of discards, and that cards don't fit in the box once sleeved. After a few plays, it is evident that luck plays a huge role, a little too much for my liking, but Jaipur is a smooth game nevertheless.

Finally got my wife playing this game: she loves to play the game. I like the game: there's a bit of luck involved with the chips you draw and what your starting hand is, but there is also a fair amount of tactical play: will I take the camels, will I sell or wait for more of the type of goods, do I end the game now, etc.. It's an easy game, easy to learn and nice to play. One advice: go for the diamonds! ;)

Really one of the best light card games I have played. It is a fast, tight, excellently produced 2 player trading game. The game strikes a nice balance between luck of the draw and having some decisions to make (albeit not too heavy). My honey likes it and it is interesting enough for me to enjoy. Side note: I love a marketplace of camels when my honey has 6 or 7 cards in his hand. "Oh wow, sucks that you can't grab those 3 silver... bwwaaahahah." Also, when you get to playing really fast, you look like crazed blackjack dealers.

One of the best two-player only games out there in my opinion. The rules are easy and the strategy is way more complex than people imagine at first glance.

I have a mixed relation to this game. I love two players, and I love card games. There is no reason why I should not love Jaipur. But I don't. 

After 10 plays I think my 'problem' with the game is that the majority of turns it is obvious what to do (so no choice). There are better 2-player cardgames with higher decision intensity.

Great two-player game. Players quickly graduate from making selfish moves to more defensive play to balancing the two in order to maximize profits. Few, but meaningful, decisions per turn makes the play very quick while providing medium-term strategy alongside short-term tactics. Hidden bonus scoring provides that little bit of mystery that keeps your opponent wondering if he should build up the big score or rush the end game.

Nice, light 2-player trading game, an easy one for us if we don't want to think much.  Still some fun to be had, though, especially by flooding the market with cards you know your opponent doesn't want, or selling first just to get the higher values even if you don't care about that specific good... Has a little bit of "take-that", but it usually doesn't hurt anyone's feelings too much.

RATING: 7
Egy perc alatt elmagyarázható szabályzat, mégis mélyebb taktikai lehetőségeket rejt. Annyira viszont nem jó, mint ahogy a BGG toplistáján látható, vannak ennél sokkal jobb kétszemélyes kártyajátékok is (pl. Love Letter, Imperial Settlers, 51st State), de fillernek kétségkívül megfelel. Többet viszont nem akarok tőle, ahhoz túl száraz és nem jön át a tematikája sem.

Update: Egy évvel a fentiek után (2017.01.03.) revideálom magam. A játék egyre inkább tetszik, csak kellett hozzá 5+ játék (és néhány profi(bb) ellenfél a BoardGameArena.com-on), mire a finomságai előjöttek. Már csak a szerencsefaktor zavar benne (bónusz zsetonok és új kártyák a piacra résznél).

Update: Eladva (2017.01.11) - itthon nem került elő, így mennie kellett. BGA-n meg fogom pörgetni azért még a tevéket, ha nagyon hiányoznának később.

This is one of the few games my girlfriend will sit down and play. She asks if we can play a few rounds and hours later we are still going at it is this wonderful card game about set collection and knowing the right time to sell! Highly recommended for those of you who have significant others who are iffy about games.

Too luck-driven for my tastes, and I can handle quite a bit of luck in games. There is some strategy in this game, but it's simple enough that most new players grasp it after the second or third game, which leaves the outcome thereafter mostly determined by who got the better card flips.

Sounds like a great 2 player game.

You have a middle neutral space where goods are traded out. You either collect/trade goods or you sell goods. You can garner bonuses by selling many of the same type of good for more points. The camels allow you to take more goods and can also be taken by your opponent.

This game is quite NON-confrontational and would be a good one for a solid 2 player game.

Jaipur ist ein leicht zu erlernendes Spiel für 2 Personen. Es spielt sich flott und umkompliziert, bietet aber genügend Strategie und Abwechslung, um dauerhaft bei Laune zu halten. Die Spieler verkaufen und tauschen Waren auf dem arabischen Märkten, um so wertvolle Waren und Siegpunkte zu erhalten. Im Prinzip muss man genau aufpassen, welche Karten der Gegner nimmt und dann den richtigen Moment zum Tausch abwarten. Doch auch wenn es einfach klingt, Jaipur macht fast alles richtig und liefert tollen Spielspaß.

Puntos fuertes: Fácil de aprender, presentación cuidada, agradable (la cuna es muy bonita), mecánica sencilla, rápido. El panda del camello.

Puntos débiles: No tiene mucha variedad de cartas. Una vez conoces el mercado y los combos posibles se puede hacer algo monótono. El recuento de puntos es un poco engorroso.

Conclusión: Es buen juego para pasar el rato en pareja. No tiene mucha chicha, y se juega fácil. Tampoco se le puede pedir más. Está bien tenerlo. Recomendable.

Pleasant filler game. Its major flaw is that there is so little hidden information: after the first 5 cards are gone in each player's hand there is perfect information if you are paying attention, so play becomes fairly automatic. Still, I will usually be happy to play this if I have 30 minutes or less to play.

Awesome light two player card driven game.. A tad no much luck with the cards drawn for this to rate any higher.. a little too much down time with having to reshuffle the cards and re-organize the points chits several times.. The online version of this game is better as it takes away that down time completely.. But these are only minor complaints, still a great little card game..

RATING: 9
The perfect definition for a filler. Games go for 15-25 minutes maximum.

Jaipur is a set collection game and the rules can be learned in under 10 minutes as each player only has 1 of 2 options per turn and only another couple of options under the taking cards option. 

The game is really all about hand management as the 7 card hand limit is very important. The game balances risk versus reward by offering up tokens of diminishing value. So you can go after them quickly but doing so means you won't build up a set in that good type to secure the 3, 4 or 5 card bonus scoring tiles.

It all works really well and lives up to the strong rep that I had heard about. 

A great 2-player game that my partner loves. The luck factor is about 60/40 but in a game such as this I have no problem with that.

The rating is based on online plays only as I don't have the chance to own or play a physical copy. Yet game play is uninteresting, light and more luck-based than I like. Probably the online implementation ruined the experience for my girlfriend and me. I can see that it may be well for couples who want something light but I don't think we need this game as we have other excellent light games (in terms of rules) such as Parade and Battle Line.

A strong light 2 player game that hit it off with my girlfriend. Components are nice but would consider upgrading them too, after seeing what some people have been doing with poker chips.

The game is easy to teach, the set up is a little long for what needs to be done. Not a fan of the chip values being preset. It allows for memorisation of the values and min-maxing the points. Otherwise it stands strong as a quick 2 player filler.

Jaipur is a beautifully balanced game. Every action has an upside and a downside, and they're fairly equal in their impact on the game. It would be difficult to have a runaway victory in this game without one player being abjectly horrible. It plays quickly, and the mechanics are such that, while you can certainly make it hard for your opponent to accomplish their goal from time to time, to dedicate yourself to stopping their progress would make it just about impossible for you to win.

I don't quite understand the love this gets on BGG.  Something like gin rummy or farkel is just as interesting a game for two, in my opinion.  Jaipur is a quick set collection game with clean but slightly arbitrary mechanics.  Not bad, not fascinating. Just something to pass the time w/o thinking too hard.  

In Jaipur you've got a "market" of 5 cards. On most turns, a player will take 1 card from the market and replace it with a card from the deck.  Occasionally (but rarely), you'll take more than one card from the market, and here you've got to replace them from your own hand.  You cash in by playing cards of a set, and for each card you get a VP-coin of that set type...and these coins increase slightly in value the more that have been acquired previously.  There are a limited number of coins in each set, and when 3 types run out, the game / round is over.  Oh, and there is a slight incentive to hold out for larger set collections in the form of a random VP for sets of 3, 4 and 5.

That's basically it.  I'm leaving a few things out, but not much.  The game is a put together really well in terms of card distributions for each set, VP increments for each set, and VP incentives for accumulating larger sets.  It is also quick to learn.  I do find the internal consistency somehow lacking, though.  Lost Cities is a very similar game, but somehow its rules add up.  In Jaipur the rules seem just a bit arbitrary to me.  Well thought out, and yet arbitrary.

Bought it without much expectation and was well rewarded for my open-mindedness. The game is rather easy to learn and has nice components. Trade-off decisions available in the game are well balanced and have lots of meat given the game size. 
In total, really satisfied with the game and so it is an 8 filler game.

In this 2 player game in Jaipur, you are trading goods. On your turn you either take cards to form a set or you sell the sets in your hand. The more cards you sell, the more of a bonus you will get. The round ends when the deck runs out or 3 types of goods have been depleted. You play best 2 out of 3 rounds. 

It's a quick playing game and fun. There is a luck element, when you take a card, and the next card up could be a rare card for your opponent to take. That's probably the only part I dislike about this game, but it is fun.

An interesting and quick set-collecting card game. The game makes for some interesting choices once the depth of play is uncovered beneath the first impression of a luck-dependent TtR:esque-cardgame. I prefer this to Lost Cities - while different these two are bound for comparison, not least due to their suitability for spouse-gaming. Excellent production quality, slightly annoying set-up.

We had heard several positive, nay, raving reviews of Jaipur and we almost bought it sight-unplayed at Essen. I'm very glad we didn't

The biggest problem we had with Jaipur is that there are almost no meaningful decisions to be made! If you get good cards, you'll win, otherwise you'll struggle through the, thankfully, short game and realize that nothing you did had any real impact on the final outcome.

I guess if you play games as a way to kill 15 minutes, Jaipur will be perfect for you. We prefer our games to offer us interesting choices and pit our skills against each other... two things sadly lacking in Jaipur!

After a few plays, I find that this is a two player game I can highly recommend to gamers and non-gamers alike.  An excellent choice to play with those who don't typically game.  The rules are easily digested, and a full game takes roughly 30 minutes.  My only concern is that these elements may also lead to repetition and boredom.

I was looking for another light, 2-player card game to play with my girlfriend and Jaipur might fit the bill.

Simple to learn, with fast turns and easy scoring; there is a lot to like here. Resetting the game after rounds is a bit of a chore, (but not much of one), the only real weakness that I see is the game appears to have little strategy, but that might be an illusion due to its simple game play.

RATING: 7
A better two player experience than what I normally expect.  I tend to hate games that feel like a back and forth tug of war between the two players.  This one somehow feels different than that.  You are trying to collect different cards of the same color.  The camels are utilized as the equalizer, if you don't see a card you want, grab the camels so you can use them later...or hold onto them for a few points at the end of the round.

I would love to play this again, as you might be able to tell all of the rules are eluding me a bit 6 mos. later.

What a clever little game! You either buy or sell, that simple, yet so fun! You have to plan a strategy every time depending what you end up on the board, who has what amount of money, as well as what's potentially out there to be sold. The best part is, for us, the game never becomes too competitive. Maybe it's because of the length of the game. True, Jaipur doesn't take that long to play, yet somehow every session seems to lasts more than an hour or two.

Note: This game has been played several times before I started logging plays.

Lightning fast. 

I've seen this compared to Splendor before for the set collection/poker chips I guess(?). So far I'd much rather play it than Splendor. Leads to a lot more table talk/fun, possibly because it's significantly less 'crunchy' and requires less multi-turn planning.

A well-balanced game that compares favourably to "Medici vs. Strozzi".   There are some tough decisions to be made, and the game seems to reward planning ahead and paying attention.  Only a little bit of luck is thrown in, and this is just enough to stimulate some "what ifs?" after the game has ended without being too much.

Light two-player game. Lovely production - epsecially the pink insert.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light but perky filler boasting trades and nothing but trades: starting with similar hands, two players must use their respective turns either to draft one of several "jewel" cards face up on the table, exchange several of these for cards in their hand or camels, sweep all camels available on the table... or sell sets of jewel cards in one single colour for points. The sooner jewels are exchanged, the higher the score. The more jewels are exchanged, the higher the bonus.

As frequent as the topic and the mechanics are, it's quite a surprise that there hadn't been a single previous game about trading jewels (or collecting sets of drafted cards, for that matter) so cleanly cut down to its bare essentials as Jaipur. Bonuses aside (which give the game some welcome unpredictability), the game has no additives: no exceptions, no extra mechanics to fit the topic, no strange conditions... 

Even though players expert enough to know when to do what might complain about some luck of the draw, Jaipur is a reliable, definitely recommendable game: it plays very quickly, it's flexible and highly tactical - often enough collecting and selling jewels at the right pace is more important than gathering loads of jewels or camels at once and leave therefore lots of tasty cards up for grabs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Gin Rummy with the dial turned up to 11, Jaipur is a gloriously-honed game which almost sings 'well playtested' at you when it comes out of the box. Extraordinary balance worthy of the hype, excellent give-and-take interaction, and some off-key art which well befits the theme. First class!

Further Thoughts: This one is starting to lose its shine a little and I'm not as compelled to play it as once I was. There's a bit too much counting, not enough variety and the longevity isn't what it first promised.

[b]Jaipur[/b] was traded away for Akrotiri 12/15/14; reacquired and then sold via auction 9/22/17.

[i]- Quick 2p game that is easy to teach, making it a great gateway game.
- One my whole family can play and enjoy, my daughter was 6 when she started playing this one.
- Great cafe game, very small footprint on a table.
- The camel cards; I really enjoy playing set collection games that introduce some kind of new element to uncover. The camels really take this game from mediocre to good because there is always a risk when choosing camels, but they will give you a lot of flexibility during future turns.

I still think this is a good game, but was foolishly traded because it fell victim to the Jones Theory in favor of [thing=122298][/thing]. Which in hind sight was probably an unnecessary culling. I played this again recently and was reminded how good a game this is, hence it's back on my wishlist. [/i]

My wife and I like to play this game as a single round and accept who has won...without going through an intense battle for 3 rounds of play! But I could be convinced into playing all 3 rounds for a prize or house rule victory condition. Maybe there is room for a small expansion here...say a token that was the grand gold cup or something else cool!

This is a great game to play while awaiting a group to get together for a bigger game.  Simple mechanics make it easy to learn quickly, but there is enough complexity and variability to make the game fun.  There is a moderate "luck factor", with the draw of the cards, but there is still plenty of opportunity to plan and manipulate the circumstances.  A very solid, little game!

Your turn is to collect cards (6 different colours of various raritude) from the 5 card draft, or sell cards from your hand for VP's. I think the camel idea it implements is clever here - instead of the usual pick 1 card (very staid), you have the option of picking all the camel cards in the draft (they don't get assessed against your hand limit), and then on a later turn exchanging as many as you like with cards in the display, quickly increasing your hand. That leaves a bunch of camel cards in the draft, which the other player may now decide to acquire for later, and the wheel turns. The game also creates pressure to sell which is nice - sell early and you get the best VP's, but hold onto them and trade 3, 4 or 5 at a time and you'll get bonus points, Thurn And Taxis style. The 7 card hand limit also drives the selling. The game is pleasant to play and seemingly spouse friendly. Turns roll along, no big or hard decisions, picking up for a few turns in a row, selling cards for VPs, then back to picking up, but always being aware of what the other player is doing to improve your own decision making on what to pick up and how. Like Fjords, you may want to play only 1 short hand rather than the rules-driven first to win 2 out of 3, but like Lost Cities you probably need to play the extra hands to help balance out the luck of the draft draw. Funnily enough my first playing of this was as a three player where it played similarly and worked fine.

"Charming 2p set collection game. Simple to teach, but forces some really interesting decisions."

Love this game, even though I usually lose. Very quick (20 min) but satisfying. The best part is when you want to do 3 things on your turn but can only do one. Most games allow you to play cards and draw in the same turn, but not Jaipur. 

Light, but plays deeper than it appears. Tactical, not strategic. Very spouse-friendly. The 1.6 weight seems reasonable, although I would probably say that mechanically it's a 1.4 and depth-wise it's a 2.2.

A truly elegant solution to a problem I didn't even realise existed: "How to design a 2 player trading game".
The agony of choice as to what to take from the central market and when does not appear to be all that compelling at first blush but I cannot tell you how many times I have stared skyward at my own stupidity while being schooled by my wife. It is a delicious problem with an almost push your luck quality to it: do I snap up all those camels and give myself all that extra trading power while offering unknown and possibly very valuable cards to my opponent? Do I force the choice onto them by selling my set short? They seem to be collecting silk, do I really want to add that back into the market?
One of if not the best solely 2 player card game available today.

It’s not the best game in the world. It’s just perfect for what it does.

Really fast games, so no one gets bored.

Strategic enough to please the winner and for the loser to blame himself and not luck.

Cute enough for non gamers – Not over-cute for gamers

You just can’t lose with Jaipur. 
Get it now!

*Update: I first rated it as a 10 and I stil belive it is perfect for what it does and really enjoy it but after a lot of games I don't have the same flame inside me. It kind of feels unexciting. I think I am playing it because I believe it's a great game and not because I want to.

A fun two player card game where you collect resources to earn the personal trader of the Maharajah. The simplicity of your turns actions are deceiving compared to the strategies the game offers.

2/5/11 - This game has now been asked for by my wife. She is really getting the hang of the camel usage in the game. She is looking to see how many cards I have or the amount of camels in front of me. She is becoming quite the competitor for me in this game.

RATING: 8
Very cool trading game. Girlfriend loves it and requests it. One of the best, light 2P game I've played.

Deeper than appears. We have used some bizarro strategies in this one. If way behind, you can take some wild chances too and sometimes it works out. Sometimes, not so much...

Update 6/12 - I think the 3P variant is SOLID. Deal out 4 cards each to start with & the round ends when 4 piles (VS 3) of goods being gone. Shuffle discards back in if needed. 

**Really want to try this 4P partnership variant I found posted here on BGG:
"Prepare four "passing tokens" marked with "P" or "Pass" on one side and blank on the other. Place one with the "P" side down before each player. Partners sit opposite each other. Deal three cards to each player and start the market with only two camels plus three random cards from the deck.

As long as his passing token shows its blank side, the active player may, rather than buy or sell goods or take camels, pass one goods card to his partner, who then takes it into his hand and passes a goods card back. Camels may not be passed. The player receiving the card must have at least one goods card in his hand. The player sending the card then turns his passing token to its "P" side. This action takes the passing player's full turn. No player may pass cards on two successive turns. On the player's next turn he flips the token to its blank side.

The partnership which has the most camels when their camel card counts are added together wins the camel token. At the end of the round each partnership scores the value of their combined tokens. The partnership winning two rounds wins the game

Tactical note: A player who passes a card will often choose the most valuable single card he holds (at the beginning) or a card which he has seen his partner collect (later in the game). The player receiving a card from his partner should not pass the same card back unless it would hurt his hand to keep it."

40+ plays. One of the better 2p games - a surprising amount of depth given it's simplicity. Nearly every turn does force you to choose between interesting decisions (not bad for such a light game). 

I also like that you need to plan ahead a little. i.e. wait to draw camels from the centre when your opponent has a full hand (so that they are forced to either drop cards they spent time collecting or trade their cards in and forfeit fist pick of the new cards on the market).  

Great couples game. I would rate higher, except that I don't have anyone to play this with other than my partner (and we have played it a lot!). Most games of this size will have a lifespan, particularly if played against limited opponents.

Jaipur is an amazing 2 player game! It's easy to understand, you can play it fast and a lot of the times the games are pretty close.

Plenty of times I won or lost just at 1-2 points difference. This made me reflect on some of my past game decisions "Damn I should have done that and not that other thing".

Based on one play: A light game for two, where you collect cards in order to get point tokens. You must select from five visible cards and since you can always see what the other is choosing, you need to time it to get the higher points (which are available to the first person to sell cards). Fun and quick game for two.

A very good, though slightly overrated, set collection game with quick paced play and beautiful art.  Think it's too simple and luck based?  Play some people on BGA and get your butt kicked.  Over and over.  The only drawback to the game is resetting the goods and bonus coin tokens every round.  Other than that this is a must for those who enjoy two player card games.

My opinion of Jaipur has gone up and down with some regularity.  At one point I probably would have rated it an 8; after a particularly bitter game my scoring would be more like a 3 or 4.  I think I've settled on "better than average"; I feel like it's one of those games where every move you make feels sub-optimal after the fact, and unlike some other games like that where I actually enjoy the experience in the long run (Lost Cities, I'm looking at you), with Jaipur I generally just feel bummed out, even when I win.  I actually quite like several of the game's mechanics, but the actual act of play feels frustrating and a little lifeless to me.

One of those rare gems that has a very short play time with light rules as well as a surprising amount of depth (and a smattering of luck). 16/1/15

Played this again and felt done over by the unmitigated luck. I was by far the superior player and lost in two rounds. I still enjoy the game but it has dropped considerably to a 7.

Update: take or leave stage now. Probably no coming back from that. I got my enjoyment out of it though.

RATING: 7
It seems difficult to create a two-player euro-style game that works well.  Jaipur definitely succeeds here, though.  You're basically trying to collect sets of cards, but since it's two-player, you have to pay close attention to what your opponent is collecting and not feed him what he needs.  Being able to take camels is a nice addition, because while it gives you flexibility in the future, taking them will flip a bunch of cards that your opponent will get the first crack at.

Well, I've given this one as many chances as I think I can give it. It's too repetitive and boring and has zero thought involved when cards come up. Initially it was a bit entertaining but after a few plays, it's weakness's began to show. I literally don't understand the hype for this game. I get that it's a great couples game for NON gamers, but anyone who is remotely a gamer should become quickly bored with this game.

Decent two player card game--a little more strategic, however similar, to Lost Cities.  Some tension in claiming cards vs when to sell compared to your opponent.  Quick to pick up and goes fast.  I liked the flexibility with the herds.

The game is a little fiddly in the setup with the tokens and not as quick as other card games.  Still will have some luck vs other games.

Man!  When I asked in the Recommendations forum for a tight, 2 player game that's not co-op, but highly interactive without falling into the "take-that" category, this was the perfect suggestion.  Yes, you can block your opponent from making certain moves or make it less advantageous for them, but it never feels too mean.  It's highly interactive, and makes for a fun game to unwind with at the end of a long day.  Components are top-notch, which always helps too.

1 play; Rating -6- Ahhh, the allure of the light 2-player card game. Even as I write this, having just rated the game a 6, I'm thinking, "You know, my wife would probably really like this. I should probably pick it up." I think I'm finally coming to realize that it's a fool's game I'm playing. How many light 2-player card games does one collection need? Is it not enough to have Lost Cities, Balloon Cup, and Battle Line? In my quest to find a perfect game for my wife, I've come to discover that I don't love this type of game, no matter how good. And Jaipur is quite good. It plays very quickly, and presents a player with enough interesting choices to make it interesting to a gamer without overwhelming a more casual player. So, my rating of 6 is rather high for this type of game, but I'm not sure whether it's a purchase for me....oh, who am I kidding? She really might like this one.

Great quick little 2-player game. Occupies the same niche as Lost Cities, for instance.

The rules are very simple; you take turns taking one of four possible actions (take a good card, take all the camel cards, exchange goods/camels for multiple good cards, sell a set of goods for points) until the game ends. Most points wins. You basically try to collect a lot of the same good, preferably the most valuable goods, preferably before your opponent does.

The clever bit, which might not be apparent from just reading the rules, is that everything you do influences what your opponent can do on their turn. You aren't just collecting sets and scoring points, you have to deny your opponent opportunities at the same time. Timing is critical.

For instance, collecting large sets gives more points, but being the first to turn in a certain set scores more points too. Therefore, the optimum moment to turn in a certain set is the turn before your opponent does.

If you take all the camels, that means a lot of new good cards will be turned over for your opponent to take. If you exchange a lot of camels, there will be a lot of camels for your opponent to take. If you are at your maximum of 7 hand cards, you can't take a single good. If you have no goods or camels to exchange, you can't take multiple goods. None of this is necessarily a big problem, if you time it just so that your opponent can't make the most use of it.

Timing, managing your hand, thinking a turn or two ahead, counting cards, deducing what your opponent has in their hand... there's a lot going on in this simple set collection game.

Update: Yeah I like the quick pace and how the camels affect the market, hopefully in your favour. Still it is too much number crunching.

One session and because of the theme and trading card play, I'm thinking this is a travel version of Samarkand! 

Prior to this game I played Court of the Medici which help bring into sharp relief why I enjoyed Jaipur more. Despite the latter design having more rules, there were redeeming features: vp chips for traded cards indicated remaining distribution, so reducing the burden of card counting; vp chips decreased in value when traded for, so there is a race element and a feel of who could be leading, so no number crunching (though not accurate as there are random bonus vp chips for trading large sets); the camels create an interesting majority race/clean up of the draft. So it is an accessible, tension-induced design with uncertainties thrown in, so I like it.

[floatleft][ImageID=985140][/floatleft]Jaipur is the game that should be recommended for two players instead of games like Lost Cities or Jambo. Jaipur is excellent. The rules are extremely acute. Jaipur has strategic value beyond just drawing and selling cards. Players must balance between selling cards immediately for a quick gain or hold out for larger reward. Players must manage their hands effectively while utilizing the camels to help change out cards quickly and efficiently.

My biggest gripe with the game is setup. Setup is a pain but it does not detract from the game itself. It's just annoying. 

Jaipur contains a slight luck element but it is mitigated by the camels allowing you to manage your hand with some efficiency.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some nice tension... going for a particular  colour or the camels will usually leave an opening for your opponent. Lots of painful decisions to make along the way. The only minor quibble is the setup for each round, but the game is good enough to overlook that.

Simple, fast, and interesting set collection game. The camel mechanic introduces lots of interesting decisions. It's also a race to see who can turn in the gold, silver, and rubies first. Very good and accessible two-player game.

Take a card, sell some cards, trade some cards. Simple, quicky, paper and chips. The mechanics are really simple, but the game gets some more nuances as you play it more, but in the end is essentially a set collection game with not much more to it (Edit: I don't know why this is phrased in a way that makes it sound negative). If you're messing around with camels, expect to get humped.

RATING: N/A
Has a reputation as a couples game, and I can see why. It's a largely innocuous card game where you go back-and-forth a few times claiming goods tiles and tallying points. I think of it more as a thing to do with your hands as you talk to your spouse. There are way better couples games out there for sure, but this one is a perfectly fine non-confrontational card-like game that isn't totally objectionable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great game. Have only ever played it on boardgamearena but man, every game is a great one. Good elements of set collection and a great points system, while the camel cards really make the game tight and tense. I didnt think it would be as competitive as it would be until I got my first Seal of Excellence and then my opponent got one, and then it was like DAMNIT I MUST WIN THE APPROVAL OF THE SULTAN

A very light two player game that sounds utterly confusing if someone explains it but is really simple to pick up and play, it takes a few minutes to get your head around the underlying mechanisms and strategic implications of your possible actions but once your get going, this is great fun. A tad random and I feel that sometimes you can lose even if you did not make any mistakes, but that applies to many games. I like it, but it needs more plays.

Played at a game shop. My wife loved the camels and the art work. She's already devising narratives. We picked it up the next day.

I thought the game was a little light, but after reading a couple reviews I realized we'd missed two of the most important rules: 1. can't sell gold, silver or diamonds unless you have at least two. 2. can use your camels when trading in the market - which is kind of the core of the strategy in the game!

UPDATE: 2012-08-06

In my wishlist comment, I said "Looks like a fun, quick game. Does it have enough replayability?" and that concern has forced us to shelve the game for a while out of fear of overplaying it. Fortunately, since picking up Jaipur we've discovered quite a few fun and quick 2 player games to fill the same niche.

Dropping from a 9 to an 8.

Such a fun little game. Very similar to Morels but I find them different enough to keep both.

This is a great two player game. I feel like there is a lot of game packed within a small package. Games that are simple to play but offer interesting choices are very appealing to me. Timing is really important in Jaipur, so you need to choose when is the best time to pull all the camels from the market, trade, or sell goods. Watching what goods the other player is taking is important as well. Since my wife seems to really enjoy this game, I'm sure it will get many plays through the years.

Probably my favorite two-player economic, even more than Jambo. It's simple, quick, tight and fairly dynamic plus it has just enough luck to keep it from becoming deterministic, but not enough to make it so a skilled player will not more often triumph. The cards are lovely, bright and easily distinguished from one another. Highly recommended to couples or people who frequently play with two.

There's definitely more to Jaipur than initially meets the eye. There's a very careful give/take system with your opponent. It can be fun to bully them around with your camels, but that could give them more options later. You may also need to give up some higher point cards in order to give your opponent less choices that help them.

Overall, it's a pretty genius design for such a simple game. One of the better 2-player games I've seen.

I didn't like this game for the same reservation I had with 7 Wonders: Duel.  That is, you can find yourself forced into making a bad decision.  I hate games that do this.  The base game of 7 Wonders: Duel had a bit of this going on, but as a whole is a far superior game, in my opinion.

Because of this draw back I'll probably never play this game again.

Bonito, simples e contagiante, é mais um jogo sobre camelos e também ele fenomenal. Tínhamos “Através do Deserto”, “Oásis” e “Yspahan”, agora temos também “Jaipur”, distinto de todos por ser unicamente para dois jogadores. Basicamente é um cardgame que gira em torno da mecânica tradicional, set collection, contudo, este é mais colorido do que de costume e tem adornos de jogo de tabuleiro – dezenas de chips, na boa moda do poker! Na verdade é um jogo de timing e onde temos de controlar o que o nosso adversário tem na mão, tarefa não tão difícil quanto parece, pois a única coisa que não sabemos são as 5 cartas iniciais, já que todo o resto vem da mesa. Obrigatório!

A great 2 player set collection and hand management game. Interesting timing to figure out with the camels and when to turn in your sets.

Played this game once.  Assessing the demand (remaining tokens) and supply (goods cards) while taking risks to out score your opponent was intuitive and enjoyable.  Whether to play or hoard camels made for some tough choices.  Each round we played was very competitive with no clear winner until all the points were scored.  Easy set up and simple rules.

What can I say? This game is a fantastic two-player trading game. The camels are excellent and add a lot of deeper strategic elements to the game.

Truly a joy to play.

The only irritating point is that the box insert is so beautiful and perfectly-sized that sleeved cards don't fit in the box. Sad.

Fun two player game, but we only played it when we needed a really portable game to take somewhere. But now there are other small games that we would rather play (Splendor, Battle Line). We didn't play it for over a year, and didn't miss it, so we traded it away.

Excellent 2 player game, in which you really have to think on several tradeoffs (do I want the camels or do I want the tradegoods, and if I do, what will my opponent gain from the refilled market).

I generally do not like the best of 3 mechanic. I sometimes find that 1-2 games are enough for me.

This is a fun little 2 player trading game.You are Indian merchants trading goods and selling them for points. The trading aspect is really unique for a 2 player game. 

Pros: fast game play, interesting trading mechanism. Fun them , and great artwork.

Cons:2 player only, a lot of little components make it less portable than you think.

One of my wife's favorites.  I also really enjoy it as well.  Great choices to be made.  Do I keep the camels and trade from my hand?  Do I take all 5 camels in the middle but that will give my opponent a lot of options to possibly take.  Really good game.

Lovely game. Played the app to death (the the point where I'm burnt out on it) so that says something. Would be even better of some of the app's variants also came in the box.

This game is mostly about timing (as it should given the trading theme). The camels are deceptively important. However there is still a significant element of luck that, while making it more accessible to new players, makes it occasionally frustrating when I'm trying to play "well".

I wonder about a mechanism for drawing from the top, maybe at the cost of a card. Probably wouldn't work.

Played once at Glasgow Games Festival (2014):

Selected at random as there were only two of us and there were no bigger games we could have jumped into.

From the get-go we realised we had a gem, rules are clear and the rule book is very well laid out.

Before we even took our first turn both of us were going "aha" several times as the game mechanics started to make sense and the amount of decisions and their consequences started to unfold.. this is before we even took our first turn!

Everything just makes sense; do you go for the camels and give the other player a refreshed marked place, do you take one item and leave everything else for the other player, do you switch cards, but that doesn't increase your hand size.

"Aha"-moments don't stop at the first turn. After a couple more you realize that you can collect sets or just snipe the top prizes before the other player has finished his combo set. You realize that there is timing to things to allow you to keep momentum; there is a lot happening.

Will buy the game and update this comment with how it plays after several games.

Update:
Now played this game very many times. It is still a very good 2 player game. Even took it with me on a month long road trip (and ended up playing it several times in laundromats). The game started to lose a bit appeal, but recently my 9 year old nephew came to visit and we played the fuck out of this game. He really enjoyed it (and beat me a few times as well) - for that reason I'm leaving the score as it is.

Update 2: 
Played a ton of this with my 9 year old nephew - he loved it. He liked to count the number of points each move made - and analyse the reason one player one over the other ('you sold a lot of low pointers for bonus tiles, rather than wait for the rare cards'). I had to buy him a copy of the game.

When I first knew about this I was sceptical. A card game about trading for only two people? It probed me wrong. This is one of the best, if not the best two player only family card game in existance. Think something in the same alley as Battle Line and Lost Cities, but much better. And even when players are competing against each other, it doesn't feel confrontational at all, at least not in a direct way, which is always good in a game that you are suposed to play most of the time with your wife or kids.

Bought like new from BGG auction.  Really good two player card game based around set collection.  Strategic decisions come in when trying to gather high level goods versus camels that let you take more cards at once. Luck of the draw on when cards come out can impact the game but educated guesses on what's still in the deck can help you win the game as well.  Hope to play this a lot more.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite two-player boardgames. It is simple to learn and simple to play, but there's still a lot of subtlety to the game and it's at least as much about second-guessing the other player as it is about being versed in the mechanics of the game. The opening hand you're dealt is the only truly hidden information, and it sort of starts you in a direction, tactically, but to turn that into a victory you have to adapt to what comes out of the deck better than your opponent does.

The most interesting thing about the game to me is the way that player actions interleave so deeply. You practically always have several actions you want to take, but you only get ONE action per turn. So you're only ever getting to do maybe half of what you want, and the opponent gets her turn before you can do the other half of it. So she might (or might not) do something that disrupts your plan. Skilled players can use this to their advantage. e.g. If you time it right, you can flood the market with camels at a moment when your opponent doesn't want to waste his turn sweeping them, and thereby execute a buy-out for effectively no cost.

Small and lightweight, so great for popping in a suitcase; Jaipur is an enjoyable little 2 player. The game mechanics are excellent - the camel trains certainly keep things interesting - but setting out all the tokens in value order every turn is fiddly, tedious, and slows the game down. 

It doesn't stop us playing it, but it does mean it is not always our first choice when packing to go away on holiday.

Tried out Jaipur for the first time Jan 2018 with my wife. Nice 2P set collection card game. I like the give and take aspect, if you pull too much from the market you'll likely set up your opponent for a great sell phase next turn. Camel collection adds an interesting wrinkle too. I wasn't crazy about the scoring, I'd prefer to sum three rounds to find the best merchant in India as opposed to whomever claimed two rounds irrespective of total VPs. Nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience and we'll match wits again soon!

Jaipur -- Played once; three-player.

I know, it's strictly a two-player game, but we tried a recommended three-player variant.  It gave me a feel for the game, and whetted my appetite for playing the game as intended — two-player.

Component quality is quite good.  The art is thematic, and colors are vibrant and distinct.  The box insert is quite functional, but also beautifully thematic, with the the game name deeply embossed and the card slot shaped to suggest the curves of a traditional mosque.

A pleasant surprise. While simple it's different both to Lost Cities and Jambo, maybe a bit similar to latter, but cleaner and tenser. There's a lot of choices and different risks you can take.

Played 3 games of this so far. I took some time to grasp some basic strategies, and even now I don't fully understand the tactics involved in when to take camels and when not to.

2014: 8. Brilliant little two player game.  There's a lot of interesting and subtle back and forth going on here. Taking one action that's good for you seems to always present an opportunity that your opponent can take advantage of.  Do you fight with them over a particular good, or try to max out on what your opponent is giving away?  Take the camels?  You may turn up something they need.  Use the camels?  You just gave your opponent a chance to take 5 points.

Plays quick with interesting decisions and interactions that require shrewdness and a bit of luck.

Charming art and packaging, small form factor.  A fantastic two player game!

2017: 9. Upgraded, my love has been rekindled with the iOS release, there's some neat game variants in there that can refresh your experience and change your thinking. It's still an excellent 2-player affair for gamers and non-gamers alike.

Plays recorded consist of 3 rounds. So far I am really enjoying this delightful, fast playing game.  Every turn seems to have interesting decisions to be made. Love that the winner can't always be predicted due to the variable secret bonuses. A big plus is my husband AND my grandson enjoyed their plays with me.  It's not as stressful for me as Battleline, which I also enjoy.  I can't see this one ever leaving my collection.

One of Michelle's favorite games. I like how the shared marketplace forces interaction. It is light and simple enough to teach children, but the better player will win most of the time. You can make it more tactical by keeping track of the cards/camels your opponent has (or less, by not paying attention).

Probably one of the best two player games out there that takes less than 30 minutes. Theres a reason this game is ranked very high. The only complaint is rearranging the tokens and adding up your score at the end of a round but it takes less than 5 minutes to do.

Gyönyörű kivitelezésű, kereskedős kétszemélyes játék. A doboz nem háromszor akkora, mint a játék, jól kialakított, pont akkora, amekkorára szükség van. Szépek, jó anyagúak a kártyák és megfelelőek a zsetonok is.
A játékosok megpróbálják a hat különböző árucikket a legjobb módon eladni a kezükből. Ezeket különböző módon gyűjtjük, majd jó időben beváltjuk. Ehhez jön az ötletes tevekártya megvalósítás. A játékban több helyen is megjelenik a szerencse, maguknak a kártyáknak a feljövetelekor, illetve a bónuszzsetonok megszerzésekor, mégis úgy érzi az ember, hogy nem számítanak ezek nagy mértékben. A pontszámok elég közel alakulnak egymáshoz a partik végén és kettő győzelem kell a végső győztes kihirdetéséhez.
Kellemes, gyors, könnyed, mégis stratégiára és sok taktikára lehetőséget biztosító kártyajátékról van szó. A konfliktus mértéke igen csekély, így pároknak is bátran ajánlható.

[2012-03-17]
Két paklival kipróbáltuk négyen. Tökéletesen működött, csak annyi a gond vele, hogy míg négy emberből kétszer nyer valaki az azért nagyon elhúzódhat. De a játék ugyanazt az élményt adta.

Nice little two player trading game.  It's a cute race for sets to cash in.  Mostly harmless, but does most everything right.

I will say that this game commits one of my biggest pet peeves.  It plays as a nice simple quick 10 minute game, but then the rules ask you to play the game over again to get best 2 out of 3.  What's wrong with just seeing who wins and if you like it you play again.  I hate when the rules "require" you to play the same game again with no growth or meaning from the previous game.  Knizia established this play the game three times thing years ago, and I think designers really need to get over it.

A trading game with two players seems like it wouldn't work well, but Jaipur pulls it off very well. There is lots of back and forth, and it's interesting to strike a balance between selling fast for the high value tokens versus saving up a bunch of goods of a certain type for the selling bonuses.

A nice, quick-playing set collection game. There are six types of goods, and camels (which help you accumulate goods more easily from the market). You take goods from market, or trade for them, trying to get sets which you sell for money: for each type of good, earlier sales are better (mostly), and you also get a bonus for larger sets. Each round, the player who made the most money gets a seal, then repeat. The first player to win 2 seals wins the game.

My initial rating for this game was somewhere around a 7.5, but now that the digital version is out & I've played many more games the rating has dropped down to a 6.

It's a fine game, but the randomness of the card market is too much of an overwhelming factor.

Race for the Galaxy (which as a great digital implementation) is affected by luck of the draw, but it presents you with a lot more interesting choices to make. Much better game IMHO.

One of the best games for two I've played in a while.  Every turn has meaningful decisions thanks to the elegant design. The seven card hand limit, the camels, bonus chips for collecting sets of three or more, all add to the delicious tension.  Easy to learn and the chips are a nice touch.  Lost Cities is one of my wife's favorites and this is close enough in style that it should appeal to her too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favorite small, quick, two-player games.

This game for two players only, has players competing as merchants to make the most rupees in a round and the winner is whoever wins 2 out of 3 rounds.  The game consists of a deck of cards and pile of tokens and the gameplay is really simple.  On a player's turn they can collect or sell goods.  Collecting goods is broken down into either picking up a single good, picking up multiples but having to give up an equal number of goods or camels in your herd (the player with the largest herd at the end of a round gets 5 extra rupees), or picking up all the camels in the market.

The earlier you sell any specific goods the more rupees you will get and selling larger numbers at once gets you a rupee bonus.  A round ends when either the deck of cards is empty or 3 of the five goods tiles are exhausted.

I think this game has endless charm, a lot of interesting decisions to be made, and is quick and simple enough to get it up and running even with new players.  Great option for two players looking for something a little lighter and quicker.

A short trading themed game that hits the sweet (or should I say spicy?) spot for me.  Tough decisions and choices for the limited amount of components and simplicity.  Easy to learn and teach, and while there is a factor of randomness, that aspect can give an amateur a good chance against a veteran player.  So it's a great game for beginners.  And the Rajasthani trader theme is colorful and inviting.  Don't underestimate the camel cards!

Lovely game.

Online I prefer to play it in the "open information" variant used at yucata.de, where all information that has once been revealed stays open. It makes for a more tactical game when you have a better idea of what your opponent has on hand, and it also makes it strategically attractive to not sell or exchange all your starting hand cards, as they are the only cards hidden from your opponent, and having hidden cards is a significant strategic advantage.

It's possible to play this way with the physical copy as well, but it makes it a bit fiddler to remember the hand size limit of 7. I did play that way a few times when I first got the physical copy, but now I only play the regular version when playing with a physical copy.

Jaipur is yet another 2-player card game which plays well and has attractive artwork. I picked it up after reading many comments suggesting it is better than Lost Cities.

My view is that it's intrinisically no better or worse, so merely a matter of taste. Both are pleasant games that play quickly and provide a few interesting decisions. I rate Jaipur a half point below Lost Cities, though, because I only buy such games to play with my wife, and she prefers Lost Cities.

What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said?  

Well, I really like it.  It's both short and simple enough that many people would consider it to be a filler, but there are enough interesting choices and decisions along the way that it doesn't really feel like one, at least not to me.  I'd be happy to play this almost any time, and it will probably be my go to game of its type when I don't have enough time for Jambo.

A remarkably polished design to be a two-handed game with such nice juicy details.  It's the business about the camels that really sets Jaipur apart, a terrific little idea that gives the game such a tricky timing.  That and the 7-card hand limit, oh and the business about taking 1 card for nothing but if you want 2, you have to make a trade.  But, oh, those camels!  Brilliance.

RATING: 6.5
[Gameworks 2009 edition] {couple, Arabian; hand-management}  Jaipus is a very quick and handy 2p game.  It is highly accessible for new players.  The design is elegant and choices of action are simple - trade or sell cards each turn; however, players have to smartly decide the right timing to sell (before the opponents, but still can good scores), what to trade, or what to take.  Smart game - the tension last through the whole game.  A player usually cannot confirm whether he wins/loses the win until scoring.  Jaipur is easy to learn and teach and plays quickly (less than 30 mins per game)

The quality of game components are nice, similar to previous GameWorks' games.  The illustration is colorful.  I prefer thicker tokens, as in Animalia.

Pretty good. Simple rules and some interesting decisions. One odd design decision was just playing the same exact game a few times to determine the winner (best 2 out of 3). Nothing carried over from round to round. I guess if you really liked the game you could make it 3 out of 5. Or 4 out of 7. I might consider purchasing if the price point were under $10. At ~$18, I can't recommend.

Addictive trade and set collection 2 player game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two player set collection card game with a trading theme. Players need to accumulate matching cards in order to obtain tokens worth victory points. This is done by either adding one card to your hand, swapping already held cards with displayed draw cards, or using a certain number of camel cards to replace displayed cards. Once a certain number of matching cards have been built up, tokens depicting the card's good are acquired. This is a relatively simple game and there is quite a lot of luck involved due to which cards are available on your turn. There are strategic choices here though, such as how many camel cards to build up, giving yourself more flexibility when selecting goods cards, and monitoring how many cards your opponent has at any one time, which should inform your choices on which cards to leave in play. Beyond that though there isn't a lot here to propel 'Jaipur' beyond other similar set collection games.

RATING: 7.5
Laura's Rank (4/15) – 3.5 out of 5. Pros: The mechanic is built for two players, so it is great with two players. It is easy to learn. The artwork and colors are good. It's a quick game as well. Cons: This game appears strategy heavy, but there is a decent amount of luck involved. This probably means that it is designed well, but I can get frustrated because it can thwart my plans pretty often.

Ryan's Rank (4/15) – 4 out of 5. Most of the games I play are just with Laura and I, so this is a nice two player game to have in our collection. I like the light strategy. I like the decisions that have to be made about whether to sell or hold on until you have more items to get a bonus. Just an all-around good game.

Overall Rank (4/15) – 7.5 out of 10

It is a 2p only game, but its quite interesting, good amount of planning needed, sometimes the luck can screw you also. I kinda like it though, trying to predict what your opponent want to hoard or need, you can try to mess with his/her plan, quick and fast filler for 2p. so it was okay i think.

EDIT: Traded it coz boardgame were meant for more than 2 ppl, i feel dont need the 2p games

Jaipur is a light hand management game that is a delight to play.  It is not a brain burner by any means, but it is very fun and fast.  You can make some clever moves with your timing of camel use but the randomness of card draws is a heavy decider in the winner.

A short, tense little game for two that can be very competitive, but somehow manages to not feel too mean. It usually doesn't benefit you to constantly take what the other person is going for since you'll just both end up with reduced profits, so you'd really only want to do it to prevent them from getting a huge combo and running away with the game. It's a card game, so, by nature, prone to randomness and luck, but in the games I've played, I didn't feel crippled when card draws didn't go the way I wanted - it really just forced me to change my strategy, and winning still seemed possible. I like this game a lot!

A great couples game, a right mix of luck and strategy for a gamer/non-gamer mix. Takes about 30-45 min. Easy in all aspects - setting up, learning, teaching, putting away. Portable. Relatively inexpensive. Luck is a virtue of this game; while strategy is rewarded, it's not like chess where the better player always wins, which I find great for couples. It's a pretty, colorful game. It's a keeper. Break it out when time is short. Enough there to give your mind a little bit of exercise.

RATING: 6
I love card games, especially when they manage to accomplish a lot with very little. Games like Lost Cities (old) and Linko (new) come to mind when I think about designer cards games that give me great pleasure. What I am less enthusiastic about are games that rely on heavy combo-building to deliver complex decisions. Building combinations, as in games like Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, and Jambo, can be fun and rewarding, but they also feel baroque -- maybe even forced.

Jaipur, despite coming out in 2009 at the height of a combo-building craze, eschews the technique in favor of straightforward hand management and timing. That's not to say, however, that the game is straightforward, simple, or easy. What it means is that the game has a certain elegance that I appreciate

On your turn, you either take cards (in an attempt to build up sets) or sell (i.e., "meld") cards. The bigger the set, the more points you earn. Best of three hands wins the overall game. Easy! But no so fast. The way you take cards matters. You can take a single card, sure, but you can also take multiple cards if you are willing to trade them for cards already in your hand. Do that, however, and you might deliver a boon to your opponent, so be careful. And then there are camel cards. They seem like freebies, but in reality they add just enough chaos to make them feel risky after all.

Jaipur is fun and pleasant. The decisions won't rack your brain, but there is enough subtlety to the timing of your card play to make the game worthwhile. You can play Jaipur as a diversion, or you can buckle down for a little bit of hard-won strategy. The choice is yours.

Wow, I can't believe how much I enjoy this simple little card game. To me it's an improvement on Splendor; though different, it has a similar feel (and both games are currently tussling with one another on the BGG rankings). As set collection goes this does it best. When to collect, when to sell, when to flood the market with camels - and the art and theme are just gorgeous. No AP, quick turns, a delight to play.

Jaipur is a pleasant little two-player diversion. About the same weight as Lost Cities, I think it occupies a similar niche ... a game couples can play without much angst, brain-burn or direct conflict that still has enough happening to keep everyone interested.

I started playing this online at boardgamearena.com and really enjoyed it so I picked up a copy at a local game store.  It's been well received by people that I've taught it to.  It's a relatively quick two-player card game that is very easy to learn but has a lot of subtle strategies that give it some depth.  I find it has a nice mix of luck and strategy, plus it's really aesthetically pleasing.  Right now it's probably my favorite 2-player card game.

After just one round, my sister said, "A little fiddly, and not enough oomph."  She's right.  Jaipur is beautifully produced, right down to the vivid artwork and sculpted box insert.  But sorting and stacking the 50+ beautiful bonus disks is a bummer before each round.  That would be fine if the game were substantial, but it's a fluffy "best of three" affair with little tension and few difficult choices.  If the players are evenly matched, you'll be stacking those bonus disks three times.

Great semi-casual game.  An experienced player will win the first few games against a newbie, but after half a dozen games, any keen gamer should be able to be competitive.

The game can swing all the way through, you can ruin a good mid-game lead by getting greedy and mis-timing the final turn.  There's enough skill to feel satisfied when you win, and enough luck to not feel completely demoralized when you lose.

Jaipur is pure fun. It's a simple game that feels competitive without being cutthroat, and the theme is entertaining. I foresee my girlfriend and I playing this one happily for years to come. Setup is done in under two minutes, gameplay is easy to pick up but rewards solid strategy, and who doesn't love camels? I give Jaipur a 10 for the sheer simplicity of its gameplay, the excellent quality of its components, and the absolute satisfaction I get from both winning and losing.

RATING: 7
The game was a breeze to teach. The rules are laid out incredibly well for a  visual learner like me. It took me literally 5 minutes with the rules to know the game perfectly. 

We finished two rounds (and the whole game, because I won both) in a little over 30 minutes. This will speed up for sure when not restrained by space and not learning it. 

It's also very pretty. Ash liked the pink insert. She's been to Jaipur and has fond memories of the all-pink architecture. A+ on the artwork and component quality. 

It will get more tense as we learn the distribution of cards and other strategies. I can see a lot of depth for such simple rules, which is a big plus for 2p games with my wife 

Overall, I like it. I could see it becoming one of my favorite small, 2p games. It's not as good as [thing=760]Battle Line[/thing], but I'm certain I'll never get rid of it.

Fun at first, but I don't think it will wear well.  We'll see.

The decisions are often fairly easy, but mildly interesting, which makes the game pleasant enough. Then once per hand you are truly agonizing over the proper course and that makes for a tasty treat. Then once per game your opponent pretty much hoses you and that makes it funny.

I have no idea why this is ever compared to Jambo.  They don't seem anything alike to me. 

Update: Huh. I played this again recently and I liked it. 

No it still isn't as much fun as Jambo, but, then again, it is not as much fun as eating sushi, sex or winning stuff. Three other things that are not at all like Jaipur.

Update: I am sort of finding this to be one of my two fallback games (Longhorn being the other) for a quick introductory game for non-gamers, a quick finisher or a one last game before bed.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3.75

Jaipur is a smooth, fast 2 player trading game with a stunning presentation,  right down to the inside of the game box.

A light entry with very simple rules,  it is primarily an open information game,  whereby you try to top your rival in a best two out of three affair.

It is all about choosing the right time to sell your goods to the market,  while trying to earn bonuses along the way.  Besides the goods,  there are camels in the game, which are sort of a balancing feature,  that provide you with additional flexibility.  There is also a 5 point end game bonus for the player who has collected the most camels,  which may be enough to get you over the hump.

Overall,  Jaipur is a pleasant journey that is easy on the eyes and easy on the gray cells.  Just be aware,  that as far as the role luck plays in the game,  consider it heavily laced.

If you enjoy collecting money for playing cards rummy style, this is your game. Wife and I always love bringing this game out. Easy to learn and doesn't take long to play.

Buy cards, play multiples of the same type to gain coins and bonuses for runs of 3, 4, or 5 of a kind. Whoever has the most money at the end wins. Simple and fun. If you are looking for a great 2 player time killer without the highly competitive, cut-throat gameplay, go with Jaipur!

There is strategy to the camels and when to trade in cards, but the luck factor of what comes out next makes too big of a difference in scoring for me to enjoy this game.

RATING: 7
Sort of scratches the Jambo itch but plays much faster and revolves around a simpler set collection race to get the most valuable tokens. Game would be far too fast without the best of three rounds addition.

Players attempt to collect sets of goods cards. Each turn consists of either selling 1 or more cards of a type or collecting more cards. Selling goods gets you tokens, selling large sets gives you bonus tokens as well. Most of the goods decrease in value as more is sold adding a race-like tension to the game.

Some very cute mechanics around the camel cards that interact nicely with the hand limit in getting cards. Nicely balanced and player controllable round-end condition also. Easy to explain.

[thing=54043][/thing] is a set collection with hand management game for two players. In a player turn the possible actions are:
- draw one card for your hand (limit of 7 cards in hand);
- draw two or more cards, in this case you must trade for other different good cards you have in you hand and/or camels;
- take all the camel cards;
- sell goods.

There are six types of goods: diamonds (6), gold (6) and silver (6) are the ones that are worth more points, but there are less of them in the deck. These goods can only be sold by using two or more cards of its type. Cloth (8), spice (8) and leather (10) are worth less, but there are more of them and they can be sold even by trading in one card.

When a player sell 3, 4 or 5 cards of the same good at the same time, he gains bonus tokens corresponding with the number of cards sold (so, if you sell 3 goods, you take the bonus chip with 3 cards showing on it) - the bonus differ in the amount of VP they give: 1, 2 or 3 money for the 3 cards chips; 4, 5 or 6 for the 4 cards chips; and 8, 9 or 10 money for the 5 cards chips. You will only know the amount of money gained when you take the chip. The chips of your opponent remain hidden until the end of the round.

[thing=54043][/thing] is played up to 3 rounds, and each round ends when: the draw deck runs out, or three stack of chips of different goods are empty. The winner of the round will be the player with the most money. The winner of the game will be the one that wins 2 rounds.

I found [thing=54043][/thing] to be an enjoyable, allowing much with so little: the options aren't overwhelming, but they permit you to do some fine plays. Most of them involving the camels. The camels, to me, are one of the cores of [thing=54043][/thing], one of the things that makes it better than, say, [thing=31105][/thing]. Because, if you have two gold cards in your hand, a a gold comes up in the market, you will probably just take it, if able. No mistery, no real thought behind: you just want more because more is, normally, better, specially if it is a high value good. But with the camels, well, you have so many more options. You can take the gold AND one or more cards you think (or know) the other players really wants. And the camels will be there, blocking other cards to show up, until someone takes them. Also, if the other player takes the camels, yes, he can gain 5 points (if in the end of the round he has more camels than you), but he also opens up several new cards for you! Having camels puts pressure in the other player, because he knows you can just take a high number of cards, without giving him anything new, except, well, camels. He may take them, making the camel balance tilt to his side, but at what cost?

The second thing that makes [thing=54043][/thing] shine? Timming. Again, in [thing=54043][/thing] you have a mechanism (the sand storm) that puts some pressure to sell goods, puting the better reward x losing big in the table. But the sand storm hits everyone, and it also kind that makes the game slower, since once you lose goods to the sand storm, you won't be able to take them all back, because you have to trade for them. Also, in [thing=50][/thing], the pressure only comes when the deck is running out and you still have a lot of cards to put down - so, timming is important in [thing=50][/thing], but it only comes from the deck.

In [thing=54043][/thing] the pressure comes from the deck, but also from the other side of the table. A player can make the game go faster by trading quickly, and this also have another reason: the first chips of the goods (except silver) are worth more, so the first that sell them, will get more. So, if I believe that you have several green cards, I can sell a couple of them only to take the 5 and 3 money chips. This makes the whole experience richer and tenser (and this sort of "race" is helped by the camels, since you can take several cards of the same type in one swoop, and sell them in your next turn).

Playing three rounds of [thing=54043][/thing] I guess last around the same as three plays of [thing=50][/thing] - but, I have only played on Yucata, so I can't say for sure (for this same reason, I can't talk about the quality of the components). A friends that has an actual copy of the game said the it lasts around 30-45 minutes.

Overall, [thing=54043][/thing] is a solid, portable and smart game, fitting pretty well in its two player slot, since it is confrontational, but only in an indirect way (taking what the other player wants, selling before the other do it), which is good when you don't want to get mad at each other over a game.

Muy buen juego de cartas para dos personas. A priori el juego es sencillo pero cuanto más juegas más estrategias vas adquiriendo para hacerte con la victoria. Cuando jugamos por primera vez nos engancho al instante y cayeron muchas partidas seguidas y con ganas de seguir jugando. Para mi uno de los mejores juegos para 2 que he probado.

As far as light 2 player games go, this one is hard to beat.  Streamlined choices keep it moving and most of them offer a tense decision.  Set it up in 2 minutes, play best of three and put it away all it 30 minutes.  Its also portable and looks really good.  I can't rate it higher without offering more depth.

RATING: 8
One of the best filler games suitable for 2 that I have ever played. The game is cleverly designed, and the components (cards and chits) are very high quality. It reminds me a bit of Lost Cities, but with less push-your-luck and more pure hand management. It doesn't feel very luck-based, nor does it feel like an abstract. Even though the theme made me a bit wary of it (I have lost interest in games like Jambo and Traders of Carthago), I was pleasantly surprised by this game.

Initial impressions: Very good game. My wife really liked it, and prefers it to Arboretum because the mechanics are more obvious, and the scoring easier. I enjoyed it too, and might bump it to an 8 depending on how our second play goes. It is one of the better 2 player hand-management, set collection style games I've played.

There are few games I buy retail but this was one of them. I really wanted to like this one, really did. My partner loves to play games, so I wanted to find two-player games we could both enjoy. This game has a good design, but it just does not nullify the luck of the draw when it comes to revealing good cards. True, you can pace yourself and not take camels to reveal new cards for your opponents, but at some point, you will have to do that and when that happens and three expensive goods come out side by side and your opponent picks it up, you feel cheated. I tried really hard to figure out the strategy, but in the end, the luck of the draw was just too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An excellent two-player filler. Just enough depth to give some food for thought, but light enough to fill up 20 minutes.

Edit: I've started to cool to this game. It's still a nice way to pass the time, but it's simplicity is starting to wear on me. It's one of my mom's favorites, however, so I'm happy to give it a whirl.

I found this game to be quite enjoyable. It is very easy to teach and play, yet not completely trivial (especially the chamel-mechanic works nicely). The quality of components is excellent. 

We will see how much replayability value this really has, but it is very nice package. I like easy-to-play 2pl games as a concept and I am always looking for good games for that.

Jaipur is well known for its lightness and fun for two players. 
Admittedly it’s simple fun, involves a bit of bluffing and guessing, luck and pushing of that. The variable bonus points on the extra coins you can win an be decisive for a victory in a round. If Jaipur wouldn’t be as short as it is that would be annoying, but I can live with it. 

As a matter of fact, I think that Jaipur is a nice game to have in my collection, as a quick non-thinky filler.

Trading with 2 players?  Ridiculous.  Yet it works.  Nice and competitive.  I love selling 1 or 2 goods to scoop the highest point tile when I see my competitor building up for a big play in that colour.

Some very interesting problems to play with in terms of timing when taking camels and flipping over new cards.

Pros: set collection with hand management elements, easy to learn, element of push-your-luck pitted directly against your opponent

Cons: limited strategic options, high level of luck

A great little two-player game where you pick and sell cards. Very accessible to gamers and non-gamers alike, it's wonderful when you want meaningful decision-making but don't have the energy for real strategy.

RATING: 9
Another game where luck seems to be a huge part but careful decision making can limit your risk or setup a set of events where you gain an advantage regardless of the outcome from a single move.  This game is simple to learn the basics and learning the small details just takes a few plays to get the hang of.  Even the learning matches are still a fun experience.  Replay value is high and no player will ever be sure to win each match while still awarding more wins to the more tactical player over time.

One of my favorite 2 player games.  (Possibly also top 10 overall?)  The rules are spelled out clearly, which puts it a step above some other games we've bought recently.   It plays quickly and can be adjusted up or down based on how many rounds you want to play.  10-15 minutes is usually enough to finish a round, 30-45 for a full game of 3 rounds.

The components are all surprisingly high quality for coming in in a little box.  The coins come already punched out and the cards have a nice texture to them.  Art is also nice.  I really don't have any complaints about this game at all.  The price point seems a little high for the box size, but once you open it you realize it contains just as many goodies as games that come in boxes twice the size.

It's a fairly light game, so might not be for people who only like heavy games.  However, I find it has enough strategy to keep me interested the whole game.  There's a lot of decision-making going on in regards to what you're going to sell and when.  Do you wait to get 4-5 cards for a bigger payoff, or cash in at 2-3 so your opponent doesn't beat you to it?  Despite the strategy involved, even very analytical players don't turtle around too much.  It's a great gateway game hovering right around Splendor for me.

Really enjoyable little 2-player game.  Quick to pick up, very nice components, fun and quick.  My only complaint is how it feels far too luck-based.  You're completely at the mercy of the draws and play-order.  It's somewhat controlled luck with a juggling act, but it's luck-reliant enough to keep it from being a favorite.

I'm always up for playing through a game of Jaipur, but it's not a game I'd want to play multiple times in one sitting.

There's a neat balancing of incentives in this game, between getting returns quickly, or holding out for larger trades that will reward you with extra points.  That adds a nice tension to the game, and really makes the game, as far as I'm concerned.  There might be an issue with too much of the win depending on the players' starting hands, but I haven't played the game enough to really be able to judge that for certain.  Regardless, it's fun, and just challenging enough for the length of the game and the amount of luck that plays into it.

This game is so tight it deserves an award. It's so bloody, bloody clever. A perfect little duel between the two of you, with just enough chance to drive you up the wall.

Cons: Too many chits laid out in a large array on the table for what should be a small-footprint card game, though it really can't be helped. Also, it recommends playing three rounds and the winner's best of three, which is awkward, because while that seems like the right thing to do, it also overstays its welcome a little by game 3. It really seems more comfy as a 2-rounder.

RATING: N/A
Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan. You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city. But that's not enough for you, because only the merchant with two Seals of Excellence will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.
\13\\13\
When it's your turn, you can either take or sell cards.
\13\\13\
If you take cards, you have to chose between taking all the camels, taking 1 card from the market or swapping 2 to 5 cards between the market and your cards.
\13\\13\
If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good per turn, and you get as many chips from that good as you sold cards. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry ! But, on the other hand, you get increasingly high rewards for selling 3, 4, or 5 cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait !
\13\\13\
You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.
\13\\13\
Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck.

They don't come much simpler than this. Draw a card from the display, swap cards with the display, or throw cards into the discard pile to score points. You can teach this in thirty seconds, but despite the simplicity, the game is flat-out more addicting than potato chips. I consider myself an easily bored heavy gamer and I can't stop playing, almost every day the opportunity presents itself.

One of my favorite two player games that has the advantage of being loved by my wife, too, which makes finding somebody to play with sooooo much easier ;). 

The game forces you to make decissions about how far to go when collecting the most cards of any type against or if it would be better to take something away from the other player to disrupt their hands - all the while you have to deal with the max cards limit. Easy to learn game, but lots of depth for experienced players.

Pleasant, not funny unless extroverts amp it (which I'm wont to do) but it doesn't have to be about having a riot. It's deceptively simple but the dynamic hits a really great sweet spot - not too convoluted, not too easy and with good opportunities to play a little strategy. Combine a great dynamic with wonderful card art and handling chips when selling goods, and it's a wonderful little game for two.

Jaipur is a very neat two-player game and one that I enjoy.  The rules are very simple but their are some different strategies to take and players really need to watch their opponent closely.  So far, games have always come very close (usually within a few points) and the game is very tight and tense because it's hard to truly know who's in the lead.  This tension is part of what makes Jaipur so much fun as you feel like you're racing neck-and-neck with your opponent for points up until the very end.

Highly recommended as a fun, quick game for two.

It's pretty cool. Like many 2 player games you often spend a while sitting back and waiting for your opponent to open things up, then react with a strong counter. Similarly, you can over commit and leave yourself badly exposed. Good for social non-gamer use, not really for serious gamers.

very interesting card game with some moderately difficult decisions.
the problem of this game is that at least twice you have to go through a very boring and relatively lengthy set up.
Once you are playing it, you can try and follow the opponent's hand and decide to wait for a good sell or a smaller immediate one. In some way there are probably a bounch of strategies you can follow to win but I am not sure the game has a very high replayability.
anyways the first impression was quite good

Fun and easy card game. Once you think your losing the right combo comes up and you get a large reward. Getting 3,4 or 5 combo can really help depending on the value under the chip. Do you collect a lot of camels to to trade for the cards in the center? Sometimes it works and others suck. I really like this game.

Such a wonderful 2 player game.  The design is also extremely thoughtful and echos the source city of Jaipur in a faithful way.  It's super easy to learn and small decisons have big impacts on who win, some time you got to take gambles.

Good two player game that will give you about 10-20 plays before you get bored with it. Like Lost Cities, the best strategy will be apparent after a couple of plays, so if you play it with the same person a lot, it's going to start coming down to luck after a while. But still, a game that gives you 10-20 plays is worth checking out.

A card game of marketplace trade at the bazaar in Jaipur for two players. Acquire, sell sets, and exchange goods and camels from the 5 card tableau. Some clever twists in this set collection game are adding your own cards to the tableau when you choose more than one good. The other twist is learning how to use the camels from your herd. Good filler game with gin-like strategy. Doesn't take much space.

A great two player game with lots of fun trade-offs.  Do you go for the quick points and tokens or save up to get the bonus tokens...  It all depends on what your opponent is doing really.  There is some blind luck to it because of your initial hand and then the randomization of the deck but good strategy helps and the best two out of three rounds helps with that as well.

RATING: 9.5
Don't own yet, but played a borrowed copy and everyone in the family loves it. We think there's a good strategy for being the first to cash in goods in the market, but doing that sets you up for a few rounds of just taking camels, or trying to build your hand back up. The game is very balanced, and just when you think you've got the most chips, you wind up losing by a few points. Lots of fun!

A must-have game, in my opinion.

This is one of the "go to games" for me and my wife.  It is quick and easy to set up.  It gives a bit of strategy and a bit of luck.  Nice and light, good for after a day of work or taking care of the kids.  A game that you can talk about the day while playing without it being detrimental to the play.  Plays in 10-15 mins/round and you can play as many rounds as you like to determine a winner (or just play each round as a game and have multiple winners).  It has some interaction via the shared pool of cards, but doesn't have the more painful types of interaction such as Archaeology: The Card Game, one of our other "go to games" with a similar feel (time requirement, luck vs strategy, simple mechanics, etc.)

I've never won a game.

Ever.

What makes this game so wonderful is it's ability to make you believe, "I've got a chance...one more gold and I'm..umm..golden!"

Luck is imbedded into this game, but skill also plays a part.  Hence my 0-23 game losing streak.  Yeah. Sometimes I want to just hop on my camel and bounce my way home...

I'll play this game any where, any time.  If I hear, "Jaipur" in a crowded room, I'll 'Marco Polo' that voice until I find the body attached to it.  Five minutes later on a section of buffet table that I cleared, camels WILL be traded.  :)

Quick set-up, gorgeous artwork on the cards, beautiful display of coins and goods, a tactile experience that soothes the soul, and set collection.  Everything I love in a game.  I'm sighing with delight even as I write.

Because of the luck factor, there can be wild swings of play.  There are also multiple rounds in a game.  So if one round goes badly for you, shuffle-up, deal-up and trade some more.  Just don't take my camel stowing the cute panda bear!

Re-playability is medium if you play with the same person constantly, but high with a variety of people.  Every one has a slightly different strategy.  I've learned mine has a 'desert' quality.  Where's my camel?...

Still receiving much play - a new 2P hit. It is not quite an 8 due to rules that are a little tricky and a little more luck that I enjoy.

And even later I still continue to play this. Subtracted a half point for the tricky rules I never quite explain correctly the first time and the setup time required.

RATING: 6
Quite a straightforward game, from the designer of one of my favourite games, Yspahan. This one isn't as good as I had hoped, but it is quite fun.

It's fairly light and quick, with simple rules and only a few types of cards. The tactics lie in timing your buying and selling so as to get the jump on your opponent, and in ending a round when it's to your advantage to do so.

The supposed play time of 30 minutes, though, only seems accurate if the game ends after 2 rounds. If it goes to a third (decider), it takes closer to 45 in our experience. In other words, it's about 15 minutes per round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is great. It combines set collection and buying/selling to make a great little card game. Timing is also very important as you want to sell as much as you can before the piles run out so order is important. I liked the use of the camels too, it was mildly thematic. 

As a 2-player filler/light game, this is in a league of its own. It's almost too bad it's only for 2 since it limits the playtime for us.

It's a nice filler game, but it's a bit too simplistic. I love simple games that once you play it has more depth to it. This game though ... it's just what it is and lacks some depth a game like this needs to make it stand out. The concept and theme is nice, but it feels a bit static to me. Buy this, sell that and get some money. Not much surprising or much interactivity happens. Also as soon you start to get into the game and building some sort of strategy the game already ends.

This is an enjoyable 2-player family game. It feels like a mix between a light euro and a classic card game. It simulates trading at a market in a very cool manner, which is something hard to simulate with just two players. The game features some difficult decisions, such as when to pick up a valuable card vs a couple camels, how long do you dare hold on to cards trying to increase your sell bonus, etc. This seems a good couples game, but having a non-gaming spouse I cannot confirm this. :)

As with all GameWorks titles, this one is graphically very pleasing, features quality components and a box sized for them, and as always the insert is stunning.

One of the better 2-player games I have played.  I liked it enough to teach it to several other people when we're just looking for a quick filler.  I enjoyed the tension between the hand management and the decision to sell now or hold on for a bigger set.  Of course the outcome depends largely on how the cards come out, but it can be mitigated by careful manipulation of the display.  Still, there will be times when things just don't go your way and everything you want ends up getting snatched up by your opponent first.  Jaipur isn't very deep, but I don't believe it's completely devoid of meaningful choices either.

Very nice 2-player game! The only downside is that you have to re-arrange the tokens after every round, sometimes spending more time than actually playing the game round.

I liked it a lot, I find it easy, explainable and really enjoyable. Too repetitive if you play it many times in a row.

Too light and too random. Choices are obvious and there's virtually no decision-making involved. I seem to be in the minority in having trouble understanding why this gets so much praise. A disappointment that makes me cautious about trying another set collection filler.

A wonderfully sleek game of trading goods between two players to become the most opulent of Jaipur.

Another fantastic 2-player game. At the moment this is one of my favourites. It'll probably go down to an 8 given time, but it's new to me and I just love it. A lot of fun in a small package.

Online bejött, sztem megveszem előbb-utóbb, kellenek az ilyenek. Utazáshoz, de itthonra is tökéletes lesz.

After 1 Play: Enjoyed my first game quite a bit.  Simple set collection but with just enough to keep me engaged and differentiate itself from all the others.  I particularly liked the inability to go over the hand limit, even within a turn, as it adds extra dimensions to decisions to collect big sets in hand.

One of our picks for an evening 2p game. The mechanism where greed can make you earn less is working nicely.

Feels to me like a grown-up/advanced/prettier/more varied (let's just call it a twist, shall me?) "Ka-Ching", from Gamewright. 

That means nothing to you? Okay. It's a light card game with simple economic trappings and a nice rhythm. If you're looking for a light game for 2 with this theme, check it out.

RATING: 7.5
Uncomplicated card game with enough depth to make it a satisfying and enjoyable experience.Very attractive and high-quality components. 
The rules and strategy are simple enough to be enjoyed by younger players, in my experience 8 years is fine.

Quick and cheerful two player card game. Players are merchants trying to collect sets of various items to sell for points. Selling goods early gets you more points, as does selling larger quantities.

Theme: Indian merchants
Mechanic: Set collection / hand management

My wife and I really enjoy this game. I'm amazed that there's almost always 14-150 points between the two players.  I've thought I won only to see my wife blow me out of the water.  Just a really nice game that is easy to teach and fun to play.

November 2010:
The best 2 player filler out there in my opinion. Rating 9.

June 2012:
I still like it very much, but have just to played it too often and after about 40 plays, it doesn't tempt me any longer as it used to. However, I really got my bucks worth out of it and I've given it as a present two non-gamer couples two times now and got good feedback for that.

En tu turno puedes coger cartas (todos los camellos, 1 del mercado o intercambiar de 2 a 5 cartas detu mano con el mercado) o vender cartas (de 1 tipo y recibes 1 ficha por cada carta vendida).

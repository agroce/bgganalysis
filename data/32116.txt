RATING: 6.5
Set collection, "engine" game with dice rolling as the mechanic.

The goal of the game is to score the most points, which are obtained through building ship cards, building parts of the Hindenburg, and by obtaining some of the development cards.

A turn consists of drawing a new card, and then attempting to acquire a card through the roll of the dice.  Cards fall into 2 main categories: development cards, which give you improved abilities such as access to superior types of dice and also give modifiers to dice, and ship cards which are strictly for points.  To further assist your chances of dice-rolling success, there are +1 modifier chips that each player starts with, and which you get as a consolation if your roll was unsuccessful.

Despite the fact that the game is a dicefest, it is somewhat interesting and has some planning to it- you can definitely improve your odds through careful planning/selection of cards.  There are 2 ways for the game to finish: 1)the Hindenberg is completed (long way) or 2)the ship card piles are reduced to 1 or less (quick way).  Therefore, depending on your situation, you might want to race to the finish, or draw out the game.

I bought this game because I knew my wife would like it, which she does, but I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by it myself.  Only played 2-players, so not sure how well it scales, but turns move quickly.  Edit: played this 4-players and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.

It has to be said about the components: terrible!  Box size is inappropriate (too big), cards are way too small (hobbit-sized, which is bad since this is primarily a card game), and the boards are all completely unecessary- just play the cards on the table ala Bohnanza.  Get rid of the boards, increase the card size, reduce the box size and now you have a much more portable game for less cost.

Yes! I have finally found a dice game that I will actually purchase and play. The games moves right along, has some fun decisions to be made, and does not overstay its welcome. This is a rare thing to find with dice games. I can't believe that more people aren't playing and commenting on this game... it is another excellent edition to the Seyfarth canon.

Fun little dice game with a cool theme (tho it is entirely pasted on.)  Options can be a bit overwhelming, and there is a decent amount of luck, but as with other good dice games this can be mitigated with some of your options and with good planning.

I quite enjoy this but recognise the possible weaknesses in it.  

It is fun and I do like the theme.  The mechanics are pretty clever considering the limitations of dice rolling.  The author thought of so many ways of changing die rolls!

Choice can be limited and a lucky/unlucky roll here and there can change things dramatically.  Having said that, this is no reason to diss the game - maybe just to say it has limits.

It is a game I would often play and that's the bottom line.

Quite a lot of simple fun but it is probably impossible to build the hindenberg unless all the players work together. (One of our games ended after 20 minutes)

In some ways, more thinky than To Court the King.  Mainly since the dice are weighted differently.  (I smell a player aid.)  Overall, easier to play than Court, though.  And about the same length.

Update: I'm enjoying this more and more, as we can play it in less than 30 minutes, now that I made those player aids (in Downloads section).  Good stuff.  Hitting the table more often.  Yeah, I like it more than To Court the King.

RATING: 7
A well-done dice-based game.  I like the use of cards to modify your dice pool and otherwise affect your rolls.  Luck is clearly an element, but players can affect/influence their rolls to some degree.  I'm not a huge fan of dice-based high-luck games, but this one strikes a nice balance.

My only criticisms are that the end snuck up on us and it seems like consistently earning lower-point blimps will do you much better than building up a good dice pool for later use.  That is, I'm not sure the higher-cost blimps (higher black/red blimps) are really balanced against the lower-cost ones.  I would need more plays to confirm any of this - right now it's just a suspicion I have.

A light, simple game. I think the luck of which card you draw on your turn actually has more impact than the numbers you roll.

If people start buying up the airship cards the game ends prematurely.

Very nice game along the lines of To Court the King only done much better. The choices seem more subtle than in other lighter family games. It's not always obvious what the best move for you might be especially with the nice trade off between building up your engine (ie. the ability cards in front of you) and victory points. Overall a pretty solid game in the lighter family game area even if you don't like dice.

RATING: 6
It's a nice game about risk taking or playing the odds. You have to figure out how to build you hand up, in terms of the number and strength of dice rolls available to you in future rounds, and how much risk you want to take in this process. Ultimately, there are only a few optimal choices available and they may be gone by the time your turn comes around or you may just get a crappy roll of dice. Entirely too much depends on luck and if someone already isn't a fan of dice rolling, because of luck and noise aspect of it, then this game is not worth the time investment. The graphics are spectacularly beautiful.

Played this a bit more now and occasionally it seems to get bogged down mid-game if players are failing with their rolls, but I'm still a fan.

I like this a lot. For me it is pretty much as a dice game should be - quick turns, some meaningful decisions, the luck factor seems fairly well balanced and, most importantly IMO, the manipulation of dice is completely proportionate for the style and weight of game.

This is a very light dice game.  At first glance, it has the appearance of a push your luck dice game.  Unlike many such games in which you roll multiple times each turn deciding whether to try again (hence push your luck), in this game, you push your luck by your selection of target goal.  This results in a game turn that consists of picking an objective and rolling the dice once to see if you succeed or not.  The most interesting aspect of the game is the objective picked - since these are tiles that give you die options for future rolls.  All these die options are aimed at the ultimate goal of building the Hindenburg.  The game can end without the flagship being built or even started and this gives the end game a strange sense of incompleteness.  This aspect reduces the overall appeal of the game.

This is a great game.  Took me a couple of games to realize you have to get busy improving your position early on.  If you wait in this game, you will have a hard time winning.

There is a decent amount of luck involved as well, and not all of it can be offset by your decisions.  

I do recommend this, not only for the game play, but also for the overall look and feel of the game.  The theme does manage to come through, though the game is not soaked in it.

A téma és a külső tetszik. Ami nem jó benne szerintem, az a túl kevés kompenzáció (1 lapka). Más kockás játékoknál (Alea, Alien Frontiers, Kingsburg...) szinte mindig azt érzem, hogy bármilyen rosszat is dobok, valamire tudom használni a dobást. Itt nincs ilyen. Dobhatok akármilyen sok kockával, ha pechem van, ugyanúgy csak 1 lapka a vigaszdíj. Ez elég fantáziátlan...
Maradjunk abban, hogy nem ez a szerző legjobb játéka.

RATING: 6
I find this game really unique and interesting.  Unlike most games in this genre it isn't about rolling multiple times, you get one roll to make it or break it.  I find it really interesting when you are forced to decide whether to go after equipment to help you in the future, or to go straight for the airships in order to get victory points.  The game is actually pretty easy to learn and play with new players.

It does seem that, with non-gamers, the player who is most familiar with the rules will regularly have to interpret what other players are able to do (at least the first game or two.)  It can get confusing with all those different dice pictured on the cards.  It also seems like it might be quite difficult to build the Hindenburg because players don't really have enough incentive to let the points for the smaller airships sit there.  At least that is my impression for now when playing with 4 players.

A simple, dice-rolling game where players are trying to accomplish values with different colored dice.  Players can acquire cards that provide bonuses, such as new dice or additions to dice rolled or the ability to trade some dice for others.  The cards represent team members, engineering, engines, etc.  The ultimate goal is points which are gained through rolling for the airships and the big airship in the end.  Some points can also be gained via the bonus cards.  It's fine, but not exciting and dull by today's standards of games.

Airships is the umpteenth member of a horde of identical games playing the same: weren’t it for the dice, whose rolling is the game’s core, there would be nothing remotely fun or enjoyable here.

Wow.  This has one of the worst inserts ever.  I dislike generic inserts anyway, but it's almost impossible to keep the boards flat on top -- they want to slide down and sit at an angle, which makes them stick up past the bottom cover.  The space for cards is for much bigger cards, too.  Ick.

The game?  Pretty good, definitely fun.  Near the end of the game the number of options can be quite dizzying though, resulting in downtime while players look at all the possible cards to go for, so it drags a little bit.  But I like it.

If you're looking for a dice game with more to it than [i]Can't Stop[/i], say, I would point most people to [i]To Court The King[/i] before this.  I'd say this game is better only if you really can't stand downtime.  I don't mind it in TCtK so it gets the nod from me.

I was surprised.  I was thinking Court of the King again and was prepared to try and move the game.  Nope.  It moves along quickly, has really good decisions to make (and they aren't dice decisions) and you are pressured to keep up with the Joneses if you want to be in the running at the end.

An excellent dice-rolling, luck-pushing game of level building that has just the right mix of player interaction and solitaire elements.  First, you enhance your factory (by boosting the number and types of dice that you can roll), and then you try to grab the most victory points.

I think this one deserves more attention. Sure, there is dice rolling, but the dice are weighted specially to minimize the yield difference. Sure, some powers are better than others so the guy who pulled them is more likely able to cash in, but if he wasn't prepared to pay the cost then someone else can claim them. I think one of the biggest reasons people don't like this game (yet don't acknowledge the reason): the game rewards a little bit of calculated risk to STOP BUILDING YOUR ENGINE AND START GOING AFTER VP! I really enjoy games like that (Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, Puerto Rico, etc.)

Zero player interaction. Just 4 people independently rolling dice for 45 minutes.

Feels like To Court the King. Early failures compound into later failures, once you lag behind you'll probably lag for the whole game. I love the idea of using different dice, but I can't get over the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer with each turn.

Airships is a definite diamond in the rough.  I won't say it is exactly maligned on the 'geek, but it also doesn't get the credit it deserves.  For a medium-weight, 45-60 minute game, this one bedevils!  We've only played with two, so I can't comment about scaling, but certainly with two there are usually multiple paths to victory, but no clear "best" in what is presented.  Most of the tension comes from timing issues - deciding when to take a card versus holding out for something better, deciding when to move on scoring which airships, and always the tension of racing to shut the game down with an opponent who is close to the win.  After six plays, I still have no clear idea about the best way to proceed, and have bungled the endgame badly a few times, opening up more opportunities for my opponent when I should have been shutting them down.  If you like dice games (and, like Macao, this is dice done very right) check this one out.

RATING: 6.5
Decent, pretty straightforward dice game: acquire new cards to acquire abilities and better dice, and shoot for higher and higher numbers to score. The game is a little long for what it is, and due to its length, a runaway leader can happen if one player gets a couple of really lucky rolls early in the game, but it's still fun to play.

Not quite what you expect from the designer of Puerto Rico but a decent, light, enjoyable dice game all the same, though with the randomness that goes with that.  It may go on a touch too long for what it is but repeat play should solve that problem, bringing it into the good filler category.  Won't knock your socks off but is a step up from Pickonimo - in that it's both longer and a bit more complex (with complex being quite the wrong word in this context) if you're looking for a similar(ish) game for a longer time-slot. Nicely overproduced, though I'm not convinced an oddly shaped board was really necessary.

Only two plays so far, but I like this one. It's really clever, simple, and rolling dice is fun. It's really closer to Saint Petersburg than to classic dice games; you have to balance the need to build up infrastructure with the need to acquire VPs, so pacing is key. But it seems to be better-balanced than Saint Petersburg, and the decisions are much more nuanced and interesting. The game ramps nicely from easy to hard acquisitions, without seeming to leave anyone behind.

Anyway, I doubt this is a long-term keeper, so I imagine the rating ultimately goes down to a 7. But for the time being, I'm quite enjoying it.

Rating based on one play. Seems like an okay little dice rolling game. I wasn't too blown away by it but I did have fun.

The powers the cards grant are not opaque like in those other games, and I like the tension and decision making stemming from only being able to have one building of each type.

I didn’t expect much – and that was exactly what I got. While I am okay with dice games, they are not my favorite games simply because of the luck involved (unless the luck is minimal and can be mitigated as in e.g. Castles of Burgundy). While I did like the idea of the game, that you build and upgrade your own little engine, the actual decisions weren’t that interesting. It didn’t take long to play, but I still think it overstayed its welcome by 10-15 minutes or so.

I love To Court the King, so I was intrigued when I heard of this one.  Unfortunately, I was left cold by the way the dice were used.  With To Court the King, you decide to use the dice after you roll, so you have a chance to react and adapt to bad rolls.  With Airships, you use your dice before you roll.  Then you just roll.  You either make the roll you want or you don't, but in either case you have no way to react or adapt to the roll.

Along the lines of To Court the King, it doesn't live up to its predecessor.  It's a nice change of pace and uses teh dice combinations differently.  Two things keep it down for me.  One is the luck since cards come out one at a time and may be useless until another card randomly surfaces.  They really needed more than 2 phases.  The other is that the +1 chip as a consolation prize seems pretty paltry.  But do it thrice, and you can get another turn, which seems to be key.

First impression -- decent dice-roller, but nothing too exciting.  Some relatively difficult decisions on which cards to upgrade when you may have to sacrifice the ability to roll multiple dice of one color in order to gain that ability for another color.  My main concern is that it just seemed a bit too easy to win cards -- in our 2 p game, we only lost on 2 or 3 rolls.  Perhaps 2p is not ideal - more would create more competition for high demand cards - but this seemed a bit weak.  Also, our game ended before we could attempt to build the Hindenburg -- I'm not sure how often that opportunity would arise, it seems that it's much more likely for each airship space to be depleted before the Hindenburg could be started.

I don't really get what's supposed to be interesting about this game. Esoecially relative to the relatively large number of dice progression games in the last couple years. Actually, it does do one thing really really well. And it's a dirt simple change from all the other dice progression games. You have to choose what you're going for [i]first[/i]. I like that a lot. Speeds it up and also requires a bit more player choice, rather than seeing what you can get from your roll, like everything else. Actually, I'm giving +1 just for that! (5+1=6). ALso my 10 yr old son really likes it for some reason.

RATING: 5
I was introduced to this game while visiting a gaming café in Paris sometime in 2007, I believe. At the time, I played the game with at least one rule error which more or less made the game disfunction. Still, the rather unique design of an economic snowball captured within the mechanics of dice throwing was captivating enough to put the title on my wishlist. During Spiel 2009, I made a conscious effort of tracking down a copy, and eventually found one at the dump booth of Queen Games themselves.

Although snowballs are not my forte and therefore subject to me avoiding them, Giganten der Lüfte is an exception. The reason is that its core growth mechanism is very simple and straightforward, without complex machinery cluttering things up and making it difficult for me. You start out with two white dice, and then have to 'grow' to red and black dice by throwing a particular sum indicated on clearly illustrated playing cards. You either achieve this or you don't: if you do you get a better card which increases your options somewhat, and if you don't you get a bonus chip which you can use to increase the value of your future throws (thus making them a little more likely to appear) or to take another action. A very nice touch is that your own playing board only has room for one card of each of the six types present in the game, and that you just can't go about collecting those cards randomly lest you shoot yourself squarely in the foot by blocking access to one or more dice. Then there is a bit of juggling and timely guessing when the game will end, risking a few quick throws against more complex and involved and ultimately more rewarding ones.

Usually I'm not too fond of dice games as the way the raw luck of the dice is implemented ruins the game. It's just too harsh, and allows for too little player control. Giganten der Lüfte is a rare exception to that almost universal problem. Yes, you can botch all your throws, we're talking dice, of course. But the cards are usually 'generous': if you look carefully there's usually [i]some[/i] card with very easy requirements which might give you a boost to aim for the next level... It's not a super game and you can equally well wonder what dice throwing has to do with the construction of airships, but it has an easygoing feel to it which will appeal to a lot of gamers just the same. 

[b]Update[/b] While I largely remain positive about this game, one thing which [i]did[/i] feel sorely out of place was the strange end condition that all four zeppelin stacks should contain one card or less for the game to end. In practice this means that the Hindenburg never gets built, parts of the Hindenburg only rarely, and that black dice are really just a gimmick. Yes, will some counter, but you get continued use the zeppelin! But that's not the point: by the time one player has the power to open up the Hindenburg, the others [i]almost certainly[/i] have the power to end the game, and very likely win, special dice cards with VP notwithstanding (which are in danger of being cycled out, too!). The more I play this tile, the more I am convinced that the word 'jeweils' in the German rules text should be crossed out. In other words: play continues until the Hindenburg is built, or just 1 zeppelin [i]in total[/i] remains on the board. Now you have a choice: take either the simple blimps (with red dice), or wait a little longer and invest in the more expensive ones (with black dice), with the Hindenburg acting as a nice pressure cooker. Lowered the rating to 5 for the ruleset as written.

What amazing potential!  This game has sleekly designed components and a strong industrial mechanic.  Invest in progressively better technology in order to score better bonuses.  The theme is also well-implemented and unique.

Unfortunately, I think it falls flat.  The issue is that the opportunities to score victory points are scarce - so one bad roll can put a player woefully behind.  I don't mind a game where chance is a factor, but it plays too large a role in this game as it is now.

One variation that can mitigate this somewhat is to allow players to use more than one bonus chip in a turn.  If I were to redesign the game I'd add some victory points to more of the phase 2 industry cards so that investing in technology is worth as much as a single good roll for a zeppelin.

Like:
-That rolling dice is strategic in Airships.
-The "puzzle" aspect of trying to figure out what combination of dice will best suit your needs.
-The theme, though it doesn't tie into the mechanics in any special way.
-The components get the job done.

Don't Like:
-That there doesn't seem to be much variance from game to game, even though the cards appear in a different order.  It feels samey each time.
-The rulebook is unclear on a few situations.

By cleverly combining the three-colored dice with the values on the cards you take part in building zeppelins and finally the famous Hindenburg.

Renè from spielbox.de:

"Giganten der Luefte (working-title "Zeppelin") is a very tactical dice-game. You need mechanics, engines and workshops.... Only the player with the best combination of those will successfully take part in building the Hindenburg. Giganten der Luefte is not comparable to Lucky Loop or Alhambra - the dice game, but a game of it's own with fantastic mechanics.

RATING: 6
Airship is yet another thin theme-roll your dice to get special powers and some victory points game, such as To Court A King, Catan Dice Game or, to a certain extent, Pickomino.The main difference lays in the fact that instead of having combination selection via multiple dice rolling, here a single roll with different averaged dice is done, to reach a target total value. As a consequence, the game basically requires risk assessment and (little) statistical abilities.The downtime is greatly reduced with respect the aforementioned games, but the atmosphere is bland. Materials are pretty, definitely better than those of TCaK (and the silver airship token rocks!)

Nice game for 2 players.  I like how different the cards are as you build your engine.  Some games one player can be very unlucky.  Also, the game seems to scale poorly with even one extra player.  For instance, with 3 you hardly ever have the opportunity to buy Hindenberg parts. Still, Airships definitely has a fond place in my collection for the unusual theme and unusual mix of dice and planning.  DOWNGRADE. I'm really not sure what the Hindenberg is for anymore.  NOTE FOR NEXT PLAY: end at 1 last card, not one card on every pile.

This one needs to be played more often.  I like that you bet on certain parts or blimps, so you only have yourself to blame when you wash out because you thought you could make that tough roll.  Every failure earns a re-roll chip though, so you can recover from bad luck.  Squeezes a lot of game into 45 minutes.

It took me a long time to get around to playing Airships, mostly because I'd heard nothing but a string of tepid commentary about it.  But one champion bringing it to the table later, and I can say it's an alright game.  I dig the idea of the tech tree that can only grow so wide, and that better dice don't necessarily make goodies easier to get, merely possible.  I'm still not a fan of the end condition, which is probably the major complaint I heard going in, but it didn't factor in too much.  Nice game that I'd happily play again!

Die rolling game where players are fitting out airships.  Thin theme, but fun die-rolling stuff.  You roll to increase your future die rolling abilities (more dice, tricky fiddles, etc).

I love dice games, and I was enthusiastic about Airships until I read the rules.  It just seems unexciting to me.  The one glimmer of interest is that some of the less powerful cards have victory points, so you must decide between more powerful cards and those that give you points, but that's not enough to put this very high on my list.  Guess I'll stick with To Court the King for now, despite all its daintiness.

A better implementation of To Court The King, where you use customized d6's, and you have to select the card you are going for before rolling.  And no re-rolls, either.

Fun little game. Dicefest. Roll dices to get cards. Get cards to get better dices.

Not too fond of dice rolling as a mechanic, but Airships is an exception.

Oddly, you have some control in this game. Some strategy.

A very enjoyable game. It uses a lot of dice but in a good way, you can estimate the risk and do things to improve your chances. The aim of the game is to build bigger and better airships than your opponent. There are different coloured dice which help you progress through the game.

Here's another 'dice-rolling euro'.  First of all I would like to say that this game is probably more akin to the game "To Court The King" or a Yahtzee style game where you are primarily just roll dice on your turn.  Yes, you go for victory points in this game but it feels less like a euro because in games like Stone Age, Yspahan, and Kingsburg there are other factors (such as resource management and other mechanisms) than just dice rolling and ways to adjust your roll values.  When I consider this and how significant the order in which the cards are come out, the game really falls flat for me.

A fairly basic dice-driven tableau building game.  Sure there are better dice games out there, but with simple rules it's easy to teach and recall if it's been on the shelf for a few years.  It's fine for children, but adults may find this too simple, especially without any unique player powers.  I really like the theme and I think it works fine for 2-4, though the game will usually end without the Hindenburg being built in larger groups. There is some good tactical choices to be made, the components are high quality and the theme great (though perhaps pasted-on...(?).  I had a couple of issues with the English rule translation (+1 pkt for example, short for 'Punkt'), and if you have some unlucky 1st era rolls, you are likely not going to ever catch-up in the technology race, but that's all OK as the game will finish quick enough in under 45 minutes.   

PS.  The box is much too big and could have been half the size.

Another game by Puerto Rico and Manhattan designer Andreas Seyfarth et al.  Formula is take an action (in this case, roll dice) to gain abilities which in turn enable you to win victory points.  The number and types of dice, the abilities, and the point-bearing airships all vary as the game progresses.  Within an hour you can be new to Airships, get through the directions, and complete a two-player game.  Fun.

Another dice roller with progression to build up Victory Points. Suprisingly fast, against what I've been told, and a good game. Slightly confusing ending, not many VPs to be had, I made some mistakes, but definitely want to try it again. **  Played it since and like it lots, got my own copy now. So the question is, why do I like playing this, which is essentially a series of solitaire turns, with no inter-action, but I didn't like Race for the Galaxy? In GdL, there's is competition for the limited VPs on offer, but that is not inter-action, where I affect you and you affect me. Discuss. *** NOW I HAVE LEARNT THE CORRECT RULE FOR THE WOODEN ZEPPELIN - THIS GAME IS ACE! Before it ended much to early and seemed weak, fun but weak. Now I've played it 3 times with the correct rule and it goes down to the wire every time. Much harder than you'd expect from a dice-roller, very good game. Grab a copy before it is too late.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Similar style of game as "To Court the King".  I prefer Airships as the downtime is significantly less with a nifty streamlined design.

Players can only roll *ONCE* and are only able to use the benefit of the *MOST RECENT* collected card (of 6 different types).  The artwork is functional but nothing special.  The competition to steal the wooden blimp also makes the game fun as the blimp provides an ongoing bonus of +1 to the die roll.  Grade: C
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very interesting mix of options.  Do you expand to be more powerful and easily build airships or go for the points?  Time is running out faster than you think!  Turn order may be a significant advantage, meaning because of the short duration of the game, those who go first, second, etc, may have a solid advantage over third and especially fourth.  We'll see after more plays.

A light weight dice game, which uses the "push your luck" method of introducing tension into play. Reward is proportionate to risk, and each turn is fraught with difficult decisions. The airships theme, which is novel, wears well and doesn't become boring or stale. While the core game mechanism could be reimaged to fit almost any genre, the infancy of lighter than air vessels seems like a good choice. The rules are a bit awkwardly worded, probably due to problems in translation. The publishers and game designer seem eager to answer questions, so a little time on BGG should get most questions resolved promptly. I recommend playing Airships several times in a row: back to back plays. By the end of about the second play, you've got the rules down, and are ready to try out different strategies. 

Great little game.

Great little dice game.  Once you get pretty far into the game rounds you can really start to work the cards and dice combinations to advantage.  Obviously it's got a pretty strong element of luck in it, but I really enjoy playing.

The box insert for this game makes no sense at all.  There's no proper "well" for the cards and the player boards are too small for the cavity they should rest in.  Dumb box insert design.

In Airships players build... well, airships. This is done by rolling dice. Each airship has a certain value that you must match or exceed with your roll. To improve your chances you can also roll for improvements like better engineers or materials construction of the airships.

The game is a pretty light dice game which requires a balance between going for points (airships) and improvements which will make later construction projects easier. Nothing special, but not bad, either.

A fun, quick dice rolling game.  There isn't much thought involved and the end game condition can run up on you pretty fast that it feels too short.  Decisions are light, and their is a huge amount of luck - although it can be mitigated somewhat by building infrastructure - but even this can screw you if you always draw a card that has no benefit to you whilst others always seem to draw what they need.  Components are amazing, as usual for Queen productions.  Airships is an above average filler, but doesn't quite reach the plateau of games like No Thanks, or For Sale that fill in the same space of time.  

UPDATE: meh, i am finding airships to be a very limited design with very limited if any thought and progression to the game.  It can be ok, and fun on occasion, but initial rating of 6 i think was too high.

RATING: 7
In this game you are trying to build the Hindenburg as well as other airships.  I am not sure why there is a game about completing something that will only blow up in flames resulting in death, destruction and the cover for one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Get the Led out!  Anyway, this game comes across as a streamlined To Court the King.  It's a little bit easier to get into, plays faster, and it does have very nice components.  I enjoyed this and I look forward to playing it again.  It's definitely one of the better themed dice games out there.  Queen does have a thing for over-sized boxes and generic inserts that don't really serve any function.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun game, but the game ending conditions are just not right. The zeppelin is just too hard to build, because too often no one has an incentive to build it. Everyone wants to finish off the other stacks and end the game. Keeping the blimp bonus (for starting the zeppelin) is good, but not enough. This is all with four players; maybe with less players things work out better. 

Still, I like the dice building. I like picking what you are going for before you try for it; simpler and more exciting. Tough decisions every turn about what to try for, how to fill up your board.

Very interesting dice rolling game, as dice are a resource.  The game creates some interesting choices by only allowing players one of each type of card in their company, meaning you have to decide if that upgrade really is an upgrade if it means losing/changing which dice you can roll.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays like a simpler and quicker To Court the King.  If you liked the idea of that game, but thought it played too slowly, then this is the game for you.  The major difference here is that you target one specific card before you roll, and then only roll your dice once.  Otherwise it's similar in that your successful rolls are winning you abilities that will enable you to roll more/better dice in later turns, or add bonuses to your total.

The game can sometimes end before it really even feels like it gets going. Consider this tweak: The game ends either when the Hindenburg is completed or [b]when one of the airship stacks is empty[/b] and the others have no more than one card.

In between To Court the King and Kingsburg in both play style and complexity.  There aren't nearly as many modifiers and clever combinations as in Court, and a single player can't run away with the game as badly.  It plays much faster than Kingsburg, and adds an aspect of deciding when you no longer need helpful bonus cards and when you should just go straight for victory points.  It's still highly random, though.

Played it once, and wouldn't mind trying again, but wouldn't miss it if I never saw it again.

The fact that the dice are non-standard makes it hard to figure out the odds of success for any particular play, which makes it hard to figure out what to do next.  This would be a 15-minute game if computerized.

This is the sort of game I've grown to love. I used to have such a thing against dice games but in the last few years there have been some really fun dice based games. This one has the added complexity of a race to keep up or ahead in your 'technologies' that should make it perfect, yet it just doesn't work for me. One of the things that most annoys me is how rarely you actually get to 'build' the Hindenburg. The game ends very suddenly when one or two of the players decide to burn through one of the project decks and I wish there were some way for the other players to prevent or at least slow it down. I will still give it a chance, but it's wearing thin for sure.

I liked this game a lot, especially when learning how to play. this game is great to play when you have a lot of different leveled gamers, because it is mostly based on the chance of your dice. it can get a little boring though when it is not your turn because there is very little suspense. it can also be very frustrating at times if you are unlucky, but overall i thought it was a great game.

There is a big luck factor in the card draws, and little strategy in the actual die rolling. The situation of other players matters relatively little. So it's both lighter than 'To court the king', and drier than Cloud 9.

You know what? This game isn't half bad. It is quite good. It seems to be a dice-fest, but it isn't quite Yahtzee. Play is lightning quick, with a very limited decision tree, and then it is all up to the dice roll. The play is about striking a balance between going for components that will aid your die rolls, similar to axes/tools in Stone Age, and simply rolling for victory points.

The reason I like this is that there is a "to hit" number you need to get with the dice, which can be modified by the components you have. Kingsburg, on the other hand, is about allocating the three dice you have rolled, and there are few modifiers that I can recall. Poor rolling = poor game.

It is slightly meatier than a filler in about 45 minutes, and what a frantic and entertaining 45 minutes that is. Nowhere near being a "great" game, but a solidly good game. Initial rating '7'.

Update (02/25/12) 6 plays: After losing a game where I scored only a single point, I'm ready to torch this with a flame-thrower! I want to give this game a '1', simply because I scored one point (so far, a good score is in the 20s)! Okay, I'm kidding... I like this game; it's cute and unpretentious. It's a dice game and makes no apologies. As another player put it: "This game is way better than Kingsburg, as far as dice games go." I agree.

Update (03/09/12) 7 plays: Deliciously frustrating! Just because you roll well and get the majority of the airship VPs doesn't mean you'll necessarily win. I've been beaten several times by players grabbing several of the 4 VP expansion cards--you shouldn't ignore those. This is a great filler to play while waiting for others to show up, as you can't take it too seriously. It also doesn't require too much attention, as it is mostly multi-player solitaire. Yeah, it's a solid '7'.

Update (07/23/2015) 12 plays: We may have been playing a rule incorrectly. The end condition is (per English rules), "...only one card at the most is on each of the four airship card fields." After reading several threads in the rules forum, it seems the game could end as "0-0-1-1", instead of the more common "1-1-1-1". We were always wary of uncovering the third airship in any stack.  And, I was beginning to get frustrated that the game ended too abruptly, and no one had ever won by completing the Hindenburg.

This game has grown on me.  It can be a bit rough at the start if you aren't one of the first two players and they take extra turns.  The dice rolling contains some luck, but I think that is hidden by the fact that multiple dice are rolled, and things tend to even out.  In the last couple of plays, I've learned to play a bit more efficiently, and as a result have done much better.

A mild, yet entertaining diversion.  And, yes, you can say, "Oh, the humanity!" one too many times.

UPDATE:  I really like this.  You try to assemble the best zeppelin manufactory possible and then dice off like crazy to build more—and better—airships than anyone else.  If you like rolling dice (and that "baby needs a new tank of [i]Blaugas[/i]" feelin') and putting together machines of cascading card effects to let you roll more and different dice, and you happen to like zeppelins, too, this is worth a look.

Könnyed játék, amelyben azért elég nagy a szerencse szerepe. Nem csoda, hiszen 9 dobókocka is van a játékban. Persze pont ez a nagy szám tudja némileg ellensúlyozni a szerencsét, hiszen ha jól taktikázunk, akkor több dobókockával is dobhatunk egyszerre, amelyekből csak a legnagyobb dobást használjuk fel. Emelett vannak bonuszlapkák, amik a dobások eredményét növelhetjük. Szóval jó taktikázással a szerencse szerepe csökkenthető. 

A lányom szereti elsősorban ezért időnként előkerül. Mi 35-40 percet szoktunk játszani, mert nem akarjuk hamar felépíteni a léghajó flottát. De ha valaki úgy játszik 20-30 perc alatt simán befejezhető játék.

Very luck dependent, on the die rolls and on what cards come out. The high range of the black dice is particularly unbalancing. Also, "improving" your available dice pool isn't necessarily beneficial, as having fewer white dice makes it harder to do some of the cards.

The starting cards are not all equal either: you want a starting card in a category that you don't wish to upgrade, as then you get the upgrade benefits /in addition/ to the start card, rather than one of them replacing it. Perhaps a good variant would be to draft start cards in reverse player order.

Only one play so far, so take that with a grain of salt.  Played with 13 year old and 8 year old kids.  13 year old enjoyed it (and won), the 8 year old hung in there but didn't seem overly thrilled.  As for me, I like the idea of picking what card to go for and I definitely don't think the choices are automatic.  I have no problem with dice rolling games, you can choose a safer roll over a more riskier roll to reduce the luck factor.  The theme is so so, I would rather be building a cool space ship, but the quality of components is quite nice.    We didn't really want to play a second time in a row, but I can see it coming out on ocassion.  Easy to learn and get started, so that is a plus. ***Upped the rating half a point.  Played it 4 more times, daughter called it "awesome" game.  Scores are often close. I like a game you can pull out, have some luck, some strategy and be done with in 30-40 mins.

This is a really fun, rather short game.  The fact that there are a few different areas you can vie for points in makes the game really interesting.  I also like that the dice mechanics don't directly engage with your opponents.  
Sometimes Airships can be a bit dull if one player is particularly lucky at rolling for zeppelins, but that also leads to a very short game.

Less fiddly than To Court the King, not as meaty as Kingsburg.  Even though there are definite runaway leader problems I'll still play this again.  I wish the Hindenburg were more likely to influence the game, and it would be nice if decisionmaking had more influence than the luck of the dice and card draws.

RATING: 8
Surprising amount of tough, probablility-based decision making in this dice game. There's often quite a lot to take in and evaluate on the cards in your hand, and the cards available - it's not always clear what your best move is.

If you insist on perfect-information, logistical-efficiency Euros (admirable certainly, but fun??) this won't appeal. But if you like working with the odds and deciding when it's appropriate to gamble, this is well worth a look.

I like it.

RATING: 7
Pretty good game.  May have a problem with end game, I see it rather difficult to actually complete the Hindenburg before the other zepplin cards are used up (1 card on each of the 4 spaces) which triggers end game.  Otherwise worked pretty well.

*****UPDATE******
Had no problem completing the Hindenburg in the most recent game we played 10/28/08.  Please disregard above statment, all but "Pretty good game".

RATING: 5.5
I like it, but it's a little long for what it is.  There are enough significant differences between this and To Court the King that I would say there's room in a collection for both of them.  However, I like To Court the King much more than Airships.  In my 2 or 3 playings so far (Caveat Lector!) I've found a slight runaway leader problem.  Or maybe a better way to say it is that the winner is known with about 20-25% of the game left.  Yeah, that's a better way to say it.

After a few more playings of it I can definitely say, for me, that the basic game mechanics are sound and interesting, but the whole is much less than the sum of the parts.  Too bad, as I wanted to like it.

Initially this looks like a light game, but it is more complex than you expect. You are trying to obtain cards by rolling dice to meet the score on the cards. You can go after cards to improve your dice or go after cards that give victory points. You also have to have the correct color of dice listed on the cards. Early on you build up your deck with up to a single card in each of six colored spots plus you have one default spot giving dice that changes halfway through the game. There are three levels of dice white then red then black. Cards can also offer various bonuses. Winning an airship gives you a temporary bonus. It is quick at less than an hour. This is a nice filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better dice-rolling games out there.  You are picking up cards which require minimum sums on a specified number of dice.  They in turn grant you more dice to roll, or better dice, or guaranteed #'s on your dice, or extra pips, etc.  Then you may go for VP cards as you build your engine.

This game didn't disappoint. Didn't disappoint me that is.

I was looking for a game that would satisfy the dice lovers in my group, with a little bit of strategy and involvement thrown in for me. However, I should have known not to. They didn't appreciate the mixture of peanut butter strategy into their dice rolling chocolate. It seems that they'd rather go fully one way or the other - nothing but simple dice rolling for the quiet nights, and heavier fare for the others.

That being said, I appreciate the mechanics behind it - figuring out how to optimize your coloured dice and the aspect of putting together the separate parts of your airship.

Airships is a fairly enjoyable dice game that feels pretty similar to lots of others, especially To Court the King.  I guess the advantages that this has over TCtK are a more enjoyable (IMO) theme and more substantial (though unnecessary) bits.  They both seem to take a little too long for what they offer, but if played quickly and approached as a light filler, they're both kind of fun.  I think I probably prefer TCtK, since the modifiers are a little more interesting, but I'd be willing to play this some more.  If all the players were familiar with the cards I have the feeling that the game would be more enjoyable.

Update: With so many dice games competing for my attention, this one just hasn't made it to the table, so I've traded it away.  In the future I'd probably play To Court the King to scratch this itch.

I was expecting a lot more from the BGG rating, and even after reading the rules, I thought the game had potential. Well, I was wrong.

The simplicity of the card powers just makes this a non-stop dice-rolling game. Granted there is no downtime (unlike say, To Court a King, which is crazy slow), but still it felt pretty mindless and a bit boring. The wooden airship did absolutely nothing, and the bonus token limit just felt too restrictive.

I surprisingly good game! I really enjoyed the dynamics of the game. Art was good, good fun factor, well thought out mechanics. I little wonky of the end game rules but thats it. I look forward to another play though I can see my rating going down with this one as it has a bit of dice rolling solitaire going on. Current rating 8.

Edit: Feb 3, 2017 Rerated to a 6. I haven't had this one in my collection for some time and I don't miss it one bit. Perhaps some day I'll play it again and renew my faith in it. For now, the afterthought is that it's an alright game.

Nice, light, dicey filler.  It's a "build your dice infrastructure, then decide when to go for points" game.  Not as dependent on sheer number of dice, as in "To Court the King", since you can specialize in dice types (white, red, black).  Victory point cards will require different numbers and types of dice to achieve a "roll goal" in order to win them.

Played three times.  Better than To Court the King, which is probably its closest relative, by quite a bit.

"Blimpie Dice" or "Zeppelin Dice" has a good fun factor to light game.  I probably wouldn't play this w/ serious, deadpan gamers.  As dice games go, I'm rather fond of it since there are usually fun (gambling) decisions to make and try for.  It is a dice engine build-up game, where you want better (tech) cards to improve/upgrade your dice rolling.  The end is usually clearly visible, or it can be sneaky quick if you don't pay attention to the different ending possibilities.  There are a good deal of decisions and they always involve dice probabilities.  With so many choices and bad luck being mitigated with "+1" bonus chips, the game doesn't feel completely like an utter luckfest even though many dice and cards are involved.  Led Zeppelin should be played in the background during this game.

Fun, and a bit angsty, as you can wind up with cards that you later don't want.

I don't see how so many complain that the game rarely or never ends by completing the Hindenburg - so far that's the way most of our games have ended. (many dozens of plays)

UPDATE: This game has reached its pinnacle, 8RTG, and shows no sign of ever changing.

Received in Essen 2014 MT for Mines of Zavandor. This friendly dice rolling game was quite enjoyable. More of a race than any other interaction, it does have an interesting tableau aspect to it. Can be a gateway game also.

RATING: 6
At it's roots, a dice game.  Has more strategy than a standard dice game such as "To court the king".  Of course the first time I played I was the Germans, and I won by building the 2 biggest parts of the Hindenburg.  Go figure.

RATING: 7
I wasn't sure about this game at first because it had (to me) bland box and board artwork, but after playing it I found that I quite enjoyed it and the board filled up with colors. The game has a pretty straightforward upgrade and build mechanism. There is nothing fiddly at all about the game, but there are interesting decisions about how to upgrade which will change each game based on the order in which the cards come out.

There is a dice rolling aspect, so an unlucky game will mean you really can't do much, but it is short enough that it is still enjoyable if you don't make the rolls.

One play two player.  Looks like it will be better with more.  The Hindenberg construction is not going to fly with only 2, as once one player starts, it is better for the other to end the game the alternate way.  But an interesting game and am looking forward to trying it again.  (this from a confirmed dice-a-phobe).

There's luck in what cards come up and then in how you roll the dice. While you may (more or less) choose how much to risk, the outcome is still dicatated more by randomness than by your decisions.
The rolls lack any suspense and the theme is simply absent.
Besides, while lasting less than one hour, it feels too long for what it is (maybe also because you can only wait when it is not your turn).

After playing it, I don't see a lot of similarities to Um Krone und Kragen except that both games use dice. Giganten tones down that aspect quite strongly and is, at heart, a game about building your resource engine and getting victory points with these resources. And it works quite nicely, too.

As so often, the real litmus test for me is whether it works as a two-played game, and I did not yet have the chance to try.

RATING: 9
Update (bumped up to a 9): Played this some more, and it really is an underrated, brilliant design. For me, it presses all the right buttons in this weight category. The tension and balance is quite exquisite. Capsule example from a recent game: I didn't have a black die until my very last turn. I successfully rolled for a commander that gave me not only the black die but also two +1 tokens, which in turn allowed me to go again and build the game-ending (and game-winning) airship! I didn't get excessively lucky on this double-turn, either. With my dice pool, the wooden airship and a gray +1, the roll for the commander had a 97% chance for success (two red for 9), the subsequent roll for the airship still had a respectable 55% chance (one white, one black for 10).

-------
Clever and subtle dice-roller with some texture and a compelling theme by an accomplished designer.

I find it interesting how Andreas Seyfarth tries to simplify the tactical dice game genre by boiling things down to a single roll per round, so there is very little downtime. In contrast to other games of this genre, this is not a Yahtze variant, and because you have to pick a target you want to roll for, there is a nice dose of risk management, the implications of which can even be worked out during someone else's turn.

While this is mainly a tactical game, there are still two basic strategic routes: ramping up your engine quickly and going for the Hindenburg, or just gobbling up victory points through building other airships at every opportunity, trying to end the game early.

Going for the Hindenburg is a risky move, but this mashes well with the general "push your luck" nature of the game.

Make no mistake, the tactical space opened up by the game is not that large, even compared to lighter fare like Thurn und Taxis. But it does what it does very well and is an excellent choice if you think rolling dice is fun (which I think it is).

RATING: 6
I love dice games and my first impressions are that this one doesn't disappoint but it's not getting me too excited either. I like the replacement mechanic which forces you to balance your plans for improvement. I don't like that you have to call out what you are trying for before rolling, I know it's kind of silly to complain about luck in a dice game, but it really does sort of kill it. Also there is little motivation to go for a lot of the tiles. I've found so far that getting a solid foundation of white dice and blasting for zeppelins as much as possible seems to be the way to go by far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
i really enjoyed the different types of cards and how each one represented basically a different branch of science needed to build the airship. But the bottom line is it's a pretty weak dice game, and the theme is pretty boring. Although the cute artwork helped a little.

A fun push-your-luck game where players use their dice-powers to challenge for new cards.  Players can either try to upgrade their powers (they have 6 different slots for new dice powers) or go for victory point cards.  You have a big advantage if you understand odds better than your opponents.  I place this a step below To Court the King for this type of game.  We noticed that some games could end really quick if there's a run on the VP point cards...

This was bound to end badly...I visited [i]The Hairy Tarantula[/i], an excellent boardgame store in Toronto, and I felt compelled to buy something.  I overpaid for this, and then come to find out, I really like [b][GameID=21632][/b] much better for scratching that dice-rolling, card-collecting itch!  The mechanics of the game seemed awkward and fiddly ("Now, how many red/black/white dice do I get to throw THIS turn??") and the upkeep was a bit of a chore.  I never played this with more than 2, but knowing most of the people I game with, this would have been a trial to teach/play.  A real disappointment, despite good production value.

RATING: 7.75
This is a game wherein players role dice to get cards to give them the ability to roll more dice to get more cards to eventually get points (and hopefully win the game).  As a dice-based game it's fairly luck heavy (all the planning in the world can go out the window when you roll all 1's), but there are enough tactics to make the game fun.

To get cards players must roll more than a certain sum on a set number of dice.  However, the players may be able to roll more dice than they have to select from, and thus have better odds of getting their desired card.  Cards give players the ability to roll more dice, add modifiers to dice, or get victory points.  The game has simple turns (draw one card, choose a card to roll for, choose the dice you'll be rolling, and then roll), and requires just the right amount of thought for a game of this intensity.

Overall I enjoyed this; it's certainly not a brain burner, but it's a great game to fill in the empty spaces.  Just don't go into it hoping that it'll be Puerto Rico or El Grande.

Fairly enjoyable game of hand and dice management that's intuitive and features some subtle, elegant constraints. However, in order to win ultimately one has to roll well, and that's an aspect that won't appeal to some gamers. One other knock against it is that the game ending condition isn't a set number of turns or until the cards run out, but rather predicated on the players rolling and winning some of the harder dice combinations -- so if the dice aren't cooperating, it can become a Trivial Pursuit endgame type of situation. 
----
In the second play, game end occurred on a different (presumably overlooked) game ending condition, which is much easier to achieve but is at odds with the ending condition mentioned above. These contrasting end conditions echo Puerto Rico's fine trio.

After watching the latest installment in the 007 series, Casino Royale, I wondered to myself, "What more could you ask for in a Bond flick?"

If you enjoy dice games, however, you really can't ask for more than what you get in this game.  Nicely balanced.  Solid.  Fun.

RATING: 7
Seems to be very dice- and turn-order driven, but a relaxing little game nevertheless. A major problem is the potential to get dead-ended until you have learned the cards - you would imagine that the dice colours are strictly hierarchical, but this is far from the case.

[b]Further Thoughts:[/b] This is clever. Very clever. The balance of the dice, expansion cards and targets is absolutely sublime, and this is a game that completely fooled me at first. You need proper strategy to play this well, and the luck is minimised as well as in any other dice game. A massive upgrade from 5.5 to 8.

Airships is one of those games that has occupied the hind-quarters of my brain for a long time, which can only be a good thing.

This game is more fun than I first thought! This is a quick filler game that somehow seems right for playing during the work week. The game comes with a great game board and player boards! Roll the dice, collect enough cards to use more dice, to build your airships and maybe even the big ship herself. Great 2-player game.

Super fun dice game, played it twice.

Although Queen STILL haven't got the message about excessive box size. This would have fit just fine in Kosmos 2-player box with a little adjustment.

Grr. I came THIS close to tossing the insert (which I normally move Heaven and Earth to avoid) because of all the extra room, but then I found out that the well was just the right size to hold Filou. Whew, disaster averted.

Played 4p at home; my opinion of the game hasn't changed. A fun, light dice game that is best when players don't spend too long agonizing over which card to shoot for. It can drag if players calculate too much, but generally the risk of this is minimal. I still hate the box, though.

People have liked this one, largely because of the wide variety of targets to shoot for (and how their importance will shift from game to game depending on what you've picked up to date and what's available) and the fact that it's one roll only. None of the tedious re-rolling downtime that other dice games think makes for better decision making. With To Court The King, the decision making is in the dice (what to re-roll; you can shift targets). Here the decision concentrates around what to shoot for, and a choice between engine building or VP collection, an attribute which always rewards replay. And it's getting some.

A Pleasant Surprise! A Light-Weight Dice and Card-Management Game about acquiring airships for points. All information is open. Good 2-player, IMO.

I think this game deserves a reprint, but with historical newspaper-photo-ish graphics instead of the cartoony art. The "Icons" need a graphical overhaul e.g. Medals, the Stars that give bonuses to all dice, etc. The cards backs design are nice colors, but do not consider gamers that are color-challenged. Rulebook also needs a redo.

Very surprising. The game is great fun and quite tense. I thought the endgame could be an issue, but turns out that it's actually pretty cool, if one of the players is unable to compete in building the Hildeburg for big points, he might go for the earlier Zeppelin models and try ending the game before the big one is complete, resulting into the big points being worth less, so the players with not so super cards have actually a chance of winning the game as well!

Superb stuff! Really liked this one.

Hard to rate this. 

What can I say for sure? I really like the components, theme and art.  I think its a novel idea.  I like that even though I was clueless in the beginning, I was able to figure it out and ramp up in time to win.

Areas of opportunity and wonder?  At times it felt, pre-programmed and a little rote. It gave me a little after taste of Can't Stop. A little push your luck. A lot of things are coming down to dice rolls. Pick a path-roll for it, hit or miss. Rather, rinse, repeat. But you need to be cognizant of opponents progress and what they're reaching for. And select what you'll be rolling for wisely.

...many paths lead to Rome.

This game has surprised me... despite my bad luck in the beginning (no building/tech/personal cards to roll for), I was able to win the game because I made a few early points.

I expected the balance to be bad... it isn't. Different strategies will work (at least there are two I found in the one game so far...) - and that makes this a good game.

A fairly enjoyable game, but I only play it sporadically. It's got a lot going for it, and a few rather niggling flaws. 

The game takes place some time between WW1 and WW2, presumably, as it features the Hindenburg (she suffered her catastrophe in 1937). The gameplay revolves around rolling dice, to acquire resources, to build airships. It's pretty simple, conceptually. 

The game features dice of various colors and denominations, and these are used to operate the core gameplay mechanism which amounts to "build an engine to modify your dice rolls, acquire new and better dice, and push your luck rolling off for airship components." 

I like the game, and enjoy playing it, but a few elements strike me as not working so well. 

Good stuff: The game forces you to choose what you're rolling for. If your dice modification mechanism isn't up to the task, you could fail at your attempt to acquire a juicy airship component, or better dice for your dice pool. 

I enjoy "push your luck" elements in games. The dice may help, hinder or humble you. This is, I think, how dice are meant to be used in games. They should add equal measures of risk and reward, and a certain amount of tension. 

The game also requires you to build and maintain a dice modification engine, and keep the thing in tip-top shape by continuously tweaking its function. I like the tinkering element, as it adds some additional decision points and potential for failure. 

Stuff I don't like so much: The cartoony art. I prefer more realistic or serious art; it's a personal preference, and not a deal breaker. 

I'm also disappointed that when you fail a roll, you get a consolation prize; a token you can use later to modify a future roll. That's a cop out (sorry). Why punish me for failing my roll, and then remove the impact of the consequences? No, I say, the consequences should stick. If the game was a lot crueler, I'd like that. One should suffer for bad decisions or luck, and benefit from good planning and fortunate rolls. 

Airships is an enjoyable game, but it would be a lot better if it were cruel and evil.

RATING: 6
In a lot of ways this is a fun game.  The mechanics are simple and intuitive, it generally has a nice progression of cards.  That said, with any dice game, a bad turn or two can get really frustrating, and by the end - when upgrade options are likely to have disappeared for most - it gets that frustrating, Lucky Loop feeling, that you need a tremendous amount of luck just to complete the game.  Perhaps experience will ameliorate that last issue, though. I'll give it another go before committing myself to a rating.

starting this at a 7, though i may float down.  like the theme, design, etc.  lotsa dice, which means some luck dependency.  i don't mind luck in games, as long as it's evenly spread.  i'm worried that in this game, bad luck in waves could really sink you.  but i'll have to try it more.  of course, it's important to use the cards to make the most efficient rolls.  this probably speaks to the game's depth.  look forward to more.

First I will say I am partial to dice driven games (with card-driven a close second).  That being the case I will say I really enjoy this game. Sure, it isn't the brain-clamp that Puerto Rico is but light is OK if one is in the mood.  Shares commonalities with other dice games if it was abstracted out but unique enough to keep me interested.  I have played it 3 times and enjoyed it each game.  As a plus this one plays great as a two player.  Bueno Amigo!

Interesting game of probabilities and risk-taking in a dice-rolling race to grab the most points. Appealing theme, unfortunately doesn't really impact gameplay. Despite this, the game is fun, light and plays quite quickly. Works fine for 2 players too.

Good components except for the player boards being folded in half for no reason (if the box was a touch longer/wider they would have fit without folding). Awful box, far too deep for the contents, with an incorrectly-sized card slot in the tray. The tray also can't hold the boards in place meaning they fall down into the try and will no doubt eventually become bent/warped.

Thanks to Larry Levy's recent review stating players only roll once my interest increased. After the disappointment of multiple die rolling and intolerable downtime of To Court A King this one roll aspect is a necessary refinement. It also sounds like there is no outcome manipulation seen in tCaK which really removes any dependency tension inherent in die rolling.

Update: at last now played a game with 3. Not sure about this one, as we overlooked the rule that another go entitles you to turn another card, and our game drag alittle (best with 2?). Surprised that it was less like to Court the King as instead of manipulating rolls, you pick up cards to increase your chances in the one roll. Interesting and worth another go at least.

A clever dice rolling game - where you are always calculating the odds, and must manage you limited number of points when you miss by "just that much".

Each of the targets require combinations of different dice and a total value to beat. Some cards increase your capabilities, to set you up to roll for the VP on the "Zeppelin" track. A nice twist is some of the base categories also have VPs associated, but those cards generally give you less resources.  

Theme is appealing, and the game play is light. The game doesn't have much "in your face" competition. About the only interaction is getting a card before the next player has a chance.

A lot like "To Court The King" in that you roll dice, trying to get more and more difficult combinations by using more and better abilities acquired earlier. However, it's a lot clumsier and more frustrating, and the player has very little control.  I found that almost every card available for me to try for was either impossible with the dice I had, or worse than the card it would replace. The theme itself is non-existant (much like To Court The King), there was essentially no player interaction, a sort of sequential solitaire, and the game itself was basically not much fun.  I could be talked into playing it, but there are a huge number of better games I'd much rather play.

Reasonable fun. The dice rolling is a cover for a fairly interactive game about controlling the timing of the endgame. The trade-off between improving your rolling ability vs getting victory points makes this timing decision interesting, and lifts the game above similar dice rolling games where there is only the single goal of improving your rolling ability (like To Court the King). The restrictions on your choice by potentially having to give up a power to acquire a new one add more decisions.

Muita parra, pouca uva!

É um jogo temático?! Não me parece, acho que não está bem feita a transição do tema para a jogabilidade, por isso os jogadores não se sentem como investidores em Zeppelins, que devia ser o foco principal das acções de cada interveniente.

Rating after a two-player game and a three-player game.  Light dice game in the mold of To Court the King.  I'm afraid there'll be a bit less depth to this, though, so I don't know how well this rating will hold up.  Very attractive presentation, though, and it may turn out to be just quick and fun enough to earn a spot at the table often.

UPDATE: Will need to be played at light speed to avoid wearing out its welcome.  Still, it'll be plenty of fun if the playing time can be controlled.

RATING: 7
Simple and fun game. You get the feeling of "leveling" up early in the game to get enough bonuses to do cool stuff later. It's a great little game.

Variant to make the game play more satisfying: play continues until the Hindenburg is built, or just 1 airship in total remains on the board. Now you have a choice: take either the simple blimps (with red dice), or wait a little longer and invest in the more expensive ones (with black dice), with the Hindenburg acting as a nice pressure cooker. It also has the side-effect of strengthening the wooden airship token considerably.

This is such an UNDERRATED game. No one seems to be noticing it even though dice games are all the rage. This took us awhile to figure it out, but it is a pretty good game, once you figure out all the mechanics.  The rulebook is NOT well translated.  There is a lot of depth here and can appeal to the more in depth gamer.  It took us a good two times through to really feel we had a handle on the rules and the first time we ended up having to go post questions and realized we'd played several things wrong.  Definitely a learning curve here!  (JW)

RATING: 5
I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It certainly moves at a much faster pace than, say, To Court the King. Easy to understand and reasonably enjoyable. There's turn angst and it'll hold my interest for the 30 minutes it takes to play.

Unfortunately further play hasn't seen this one hold up to scrutiny. My main beef with it is that the costly acquisition of red and black dice doesn't lead to easier target numbers. In fact they seem to me to be harder. You might as well go for the easy white dice targets rather than build up a massively strong factory. Yes the red and black dice allow you to build the bigger and better ships, but there's so few of them available before the game end triggers - compared to all the white die easy ships available - that it's hardly worth the investment before the game ends. All the games seem to be won by the player building the cheap ships and keeping the airship bonus in their hot little hands.

I'd like a game with more a of a factory feel to it. The building of airships is an amazing theme for a game, but despite a good try this one doesn't really do it justice.

Simple rules combined with engine-building and multiple ways to achieve victory points keeps this game feeling fresh each time! Some have complained that it's too luck dependent - it's a dice game, so this is expected - but much can be done to mitigate the luck considerably.

A highly recommended filler!

Giganten der Lüfte (Airships) -- Played once; four-player.  Things I learned from my first play: 1) Take risks -- the risk of loss is countered by the potential acquisition of a  1 chip. 2) The game is too short to focus on building a great player-board -- build it up only enough to pursue available victory points. 3) Get red dice as soon as possible, while leaving at least one white die available -- other accoutrements may be enticing, but red is key to immediate payoffs. 4) The game can end quickly -- keep an eye on those airship stacks!

I was disappointed when the game ended just as our boards were becoming interesting.  I would have liked the airship stacks to have been taller, so the game could have allowed more focus on building, but I recognize that the game's weight  doesn't warrant long duration.  An even stronger argument against long duration is the potential for a bad string of dice-rolls to practically eliminate a player.

Still, I found the game refreshing, and will gladly play it with fans of dice-driven games.

I don’t really know anything about airships beyond that one scene in Indiana Jones, but I like the unique theme here. Unfortunately, the closest the game gets to actually evoking its subject matter is by being packaged in an oversized container filled mostly with air. 

The gameplay focuses on how cards are acquired; each card has a minimum cost value which has to be met by rolling a specific set of dice. Once acquired, these cards typically allow their owner to access a wider range of dice. It’s quick, easy to teach, and at the very least presents decisions between adding cards to the tableau and scoring points. 

However, there is a missed opportunity in the dual endgame conditions. It’s a bit too easy for players to trigger the game end by rushing out generic airships, which renders the alternative condition of completing the Hindenburg rather pointless. A sort of enjoyable game nonetheless, but it doesn’t leave a lasting impression either.

I really enjoy the dice mechanisms in this game. They secure the balance between luck and tactical nature of this game. The  optimization of your tableau mitigates the lucky dice rolls. The many combinations of cards allow differently working "engines" which drive the game.

[1 play] Learning game. I got very favorable dice.

The artwork and the theme are nice and this is a better dice game than To Court the King.

However, for this type of dice-ability-advancement game, I don't think the decisions are interesting enough or challenging enough.

Most recent play 5-3-08 with Garrett.

Surely Queen picked this up on the strength of Seyfarth alone? Why? Their library includes the similar dice game, Lucky Loop. The graphic design is overly basic and of prototype quality and the game isn’t nearly as good as other ‘Yahtzee with special abilities’ games such as To Court the King and even aforementioned Lucky Loop. And maybe even (IMHO), the severely underrated Combo King.

Players use their starting dice to roll and try to gain more cards (across six categories) in order to tool up and roll to build airships. The game ends when the Hindenburg is built or when a certain number of smaller airships are built. The game isn’t great to look at and the rolling didn’t particularly engage. With several other similar dice games on the market, releasing a so-so one is just sheer folly and a waste of good forest. If you want a dice game with similar experience and an ‘air’ theme, get Lucky Loop instead.

OK game.  Seems to rely a lot on the dice rolls.  Also, whoever has the airship has a big advantage, and while you can get it off them, it may be that the cards to do so are so difficult you need the advantage of the airship to do so!

Dice. Nice light/medium weight dice game. The buying of cards using dice, which then alter your dice rolling capabilities, reminds me of To Court the King; this is a little beefier, where TCtK is a little more streamlined and quicker. Wouldn't mind playing some more.

A decent dice game. I had hoped for a little more "game" in this Queen game.
Update: I've decreased the rating by 1. It gets pretty repetitive quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
How 'bout I try this one?  
Roll. 
Did I make it?  
Yes! Yay! 
Wait for turn. 
How'bout I try that one. 
Roll No! Boo!.  
Repeat.
Repeat.
Repeat. 

For me the real problem is that drafting games are getting real old.  There are still some drafting games out there that can pull it off, but this so dependent on what cards come up.  I feel that your decisions are made by what cards come up.  A good drafting game forces you to choose between the options that facilitate what you need to do.  This game makes all the choices for you and you just see if you get to take them.   The drafting feels like it is only there so that you have an opportunity to even try for cards.
  
This is a tight little engine game. While the engine works, if you aren't given the opportunity to earn a red die, you are going to be prohibited from a number of types of decisions for the rest of the game. In games, when I have no worthwhile decisions, I tend to turn off and the game becomes boring from that point on. I would imagine that when things are going well, and card distribution runs even, this could be more enjoyable. 

Flukey or not, games that preventing players from making decisions are not the kinds of games I want to be playing.  It certainly wouldn't be common, but it is not entirely unlikely for a player to be in a position where they can't do anything.  Even when you are given options, I'd be hard pressed to see any room for clever play here.

The other thing is that this is an engine building game.  While I recognize this element comes with this kind of dice game, if you blow too many dice rolls, you will lose, but because everyone is building efficiency engines, if you get behind the curve in the beginning you will never be able to catch up.  A classic rich get richer situation.

I hope they put out a flaming Hindenburg expansion.

A very light and very social dice game with some mathy yet strategic decisions. I have not played To Court The King, which I believe is in the same vein, but I liked Airships alot, enough that I wanted to play again immediately. The components are top notch, the theme is fun, and the glory of rolling dice in a Euro is just yummy. My favorite aspect of the game is that instead of the normal six sided dice there are three different sets of dice with different numbers on each: 3 white dice - 1,1,2,2,3,3 + 3 red dice - 2,3,3,4,4,5 + 3 black dice - 4,4,6,6,8,8. It made for a scaling, engine building model but for dice. Brilliant! As you have to diversify out to have white and red in your arsenal but ultimately need the black die to get the better cards with bonus victory points. Recommended for a kick off or night cap.

Roll dice, trying to get a specific number using specific dice type, in order to get either a new power (a die of a different color; possibly some manipulation) or VP. Like To Court the King, it's probably better with 2 or 3 players. I prefer TCtK, especially when played with the (prototype) expansion characters.

I like dice rolling and drafting, so a game by Andreas Seyfarth combining the two is a sure-fire hit, right? I guess it fell the way of some supergroups where you combine musicians from great bands and it just doesn't gel.  I still sort of like Airships but it does feel flat where even the dice rolling isn't that exciting and the rich seem to get richer too.

Designed by the same guy who created such forgettable titles as Puerto Rico and San Juan, this game is nevertheless a beautifully streamlined and fun little game.  In fact, it's about as stripped down a dice-based economic engine game as you'll find.  The theme, though unique and interesting, isn't brought out much by the game play or the somewhat drab, beige-and-red-and-blue art design.  Still, Airships is good for some dice-chuckin' fun!

RATING: 7
Airships was one of the first Queen games I tried, and turned out to be one of my favorites. Sure, it's a dice game, but you have to watch your opponents and there is some strategy in the timing of when you choose to escalate to the red dice and then the black dice, because you can get those dice only by sacrificing lesser dice. Also there are hard decisions to be made when choosing which airships to build; and you want to plan carefully and be ready to jump as soon as the Hindenburg is unlocked, because the first Hindenburg section seems trivially easy to win. I really can't picture anyone ever getting the bonus points for completing all four Hindenburg sections, unless he/she completely ran away with the victory.

Play again? Yes! The dice-rolling was lots of fun. The game rewards those who go after the red and black dice early, but that's also risky; I blew lots of flag chits rerolling to try to get the red dice I needed. I think Airships would also go over well with the family if I ever have a chance to introduce it to them.

RATING: 5
[Queen Games International 08 edition] {Airships; dice-rolling; optimal 4p} Airships is not as fun as I expected.  Down time is a problem but I believe it will get better with more plays and if players use less time in making decisions.  Also, it lacks a good variety of cards for different tactical options.  Thus, it should be a filler but the playing time is just too long.

Its system works. Players can have tactical choices such as developing engines, rushing for 1 extra turn, collecting victory points for building Hindenburg, etc.  The way to use dice is special but not great.  There are some player interactions because players have to compete for victory points and engine tiles.  The climax comes at late game when some players attempt to complete Hindenburg and other players try to stop this by pushing the game to end.  However, it is still a dice game - players who despise luck would not like it because results of dice rolls and the order of cards drawn are important.

Components are nice and effective but the box is horribly large.  I like the color tune. The theme is very thin and I sometimes wonder why the cards are like that.  The international edition is just overpriced.  I could get Big Alea games with similar price!

A very nice dice rolling game.  Players roll dice to aquire cards which grant more dice or bonuses to future die rolls.  Eventually your focus shifts from building up your bonuses to using your bonuses to aquire victory points.

tl;dr: not earth shattering, but it works well

This game from the designer of [thing=3076][/thing] is nothing like that game. This is a streamlined, pretty basic, family friendly strategic dice game. It's also an engine building game. A bit like [thing=21632][/thing] I guess: use dice to expand your possibilities. But in this game the possibilities are a bit more basic. More dice or convert certain dice into dice of a different color. Stuff like that.
It's a dice game, so there is a good dose of luck of course, but if you choose your battles well, and build a good engine, success has a higher possibility of being the result.
I quite enjoy it, but it certainly is not a game that stands out in any manner.

Pros: A great blend of theme and mechanics.
Dice roller.

Conclusion: Airships is a favorite dice roller of mine.  I like the theme of building different airships by improving your company.  There is some aggrivation when it comes to failing when you try to get a card that you are not quite ready to get.  But the speed of the game and the light strategy make this one a winner.

I was really thrilled of this after reading the rules because it looked like taking "To Court to King" to the next level.
After one play I was rather disappointed. I think it only looks like you got more tactical decisions but in fact it's mostly more luck.
I was unlucky.
I'd give it another try though.

After owning the game I played some more. I still think there is a lot luck involved, but it is a nice game.

This mid-weight dice game works perfectly well, giving players plenty of options and usually winding its way to a conclusion within a reasonable amount of time. It seems a little less forgiving than some other dice games, as a couple of bad rolls can put a player hopelessly behind. Theme doesn't do much for me or seem to fit all that well with the mechanics of the game, leaving my overall impression of this one as just OK - harmless rather than something I'd get excited to play.

RATING: 6.5
Played 3 times, once with 4 players, the rest with 2. The game definitely plays differently with more players, but is enjoyable with all numbers. A bit of a dice-fest. There are dice, but unless one rolls particularly badly, a player can progress ahead roughly evenly with the other players. By cleverly combining the three-colored dice with the values on the cards you take part in building zeppelins and finally the famous Hindenburg. Airships is a very tactical dice-game. You need mechanics, engines and workshops.... Only the player with the best combination of those will successfully take part in building the Hindenburg. Basically, players use the dice available to them to upgrade their "facility" (collection of 6 different colored cards) so they can use more dice of the different types of dice to try to build the airships (which award victory points) and one of the four stages of the Hindenburg which also award VPs. Once one of the two end-game conditions is met, everybody totals up their VPs to see who wins. Suitable for younger kids.

Airships is an excellent middleweight that uses dice strategically.  Dice are thrown and converted into other dice, which are thrown and converted into other dice, which are thrown and converted into points.  There's a bit more to Airships, but it's easy to get lost without some intermediary physical materials.  It helps to place your available dice on the player mat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK, I guess I should quantify why I gave this a 7.  

Why?

1.  Playing Airships is easy, it does not require a ton of effort in setup or in the actual playing of the game.

2.  Yet at the same time, it does allow for a decent amount of strategy, even if the strategy is only surface level.

3.  It does not try to be something more than it is.  It is a light dice game, designed more for families than the heavier gamers.

4.  It is a guilty pleasure to throw a handful of dice.


It is so light it is hard to believe, and there is not a pile of depth to the game.  It can suffer a bit if all players don't realize how the game can end in a snap.  There are so many negative things that can be said about this game (a lack of control, it can seem mechanical at times, whatever).  But I really enjoy playing it.  It can move along very briskly, or it can poke at a snail's pace (depending of course on the players' propensity for AP).  It is easy to teach and learn, and really is accessible, especially after a first playing of the game.  I've never played To Court the King, but I have played Kingsburg, and compared to Kingsburg, I absolutely love Airships.

Kingsburg is a very mechanical game--it sometimes seems to be that playing it live is more of an exercise than an activity.  Airships has more interaction, and has a much more ideal length.  Games with the weight of either of these games should not take as long as a game of Power Grid.  Airships really can be played in 30-60 minutes.  

Add those things to the fact that my wife loves it (even insisting on playing 3 times straight the first night we got it), and it is a winner.  A light winner, but a winner nonetheless.

Feels just one small notch above Lucky Loop for me. I know I shouldn't get caught up on theme here, but why are four nations bonding together to build the Hindenburg? I think I might have enjoyed it more if we were building, say, the international space station.

I like the general system.  I wish the cards were more varied and allowed for more specialization.  One play, and I think its a solid 2 player game, but I can see how much game they left off of the table if it had the "race for the galaxy" or "dominion" treatment with respect to the cards.

Playing Innovation with the multiple cards which get stacked upon multiple colors really dwindles my desire to play this.  I enjoy this when it comes out, but there are just games which play in the same time which are awesome and amazing, while this is simply solid.  This is a fun once in a while game.

I certainly don't mind dice in games (see, e.g., Die Macher, Age of Steam, Twilight Struggle, StreetSoccer, Byzantium), but dice games don't seem to work for me, such as To Court the King and now Airships. Dice as an element of a game among a larger whole make sense, but dice as the focus of the game is just not something I find interesting. Since Manhattan and Puerto Rico, Seyfarth has really struck out with me, from San Juan, to Thurn & Taxis, and now to Airships. It's not the kind of game that I'll refuse to play again because it's quick and inoffensive. In fact, I played it a second time two months later in July when someone suggested it, but it's not something I'll suggest or purchase because I'm generally looking for a more memorable game experience, something that you can think back on later and that has substance worth recalling. Even short and light games, like Wings of War above, can have this, it's not just the province of the long and heavy games, but sadly Airships lacked this quality, in the same way that To Court the King felt pointless.

Airships is a dicebuilding game, where you roll dice to try to acquire cards that give you more dice to roll, to get more cards to get more dice to roll, repeat, repeat, to get you cards with victory points.

There's nothing terribly wrong with the game, and it's somewhat interesting... but I couldn't get more worked up than a "meh" for this game.

It's a little too long and maybe just a tad too thinky to be a good filler, but not really enough game to be anything other than a filler.

Would really need to be in the right mood to play again.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  The way in which you feel like you aren't really getting anywhere as the game goes on because the goals get harder just as your dice get better (giving you a net improvment from the beginning of the game of zero), makes this just frustrating.

RATING: 7
The cards building upon themselves and a cool balance of "sure thing vs. risk" make this pretty interesting. Not the typical dice game, with the luck being very much under control - you can choose very conservative options and be guaranteed some okay tiles, or you can go risky and potentially reap big rewards. The endgame condition is still kinda wonky though, with the Hindenburg building rarely even getting started. Not the deepest game out there, but a fun quickie.

Now have played this many times with 2, 3 and 4 players and it's great.
A. I love dice games. B. This is really clever. C. I'm an airship nut. What more could I want? Oh, and it really takes 45 minutes or less to play!

As for those who say there is no player interaction... what happens if the other three players take all the cards I want? I call that interaction. Snarfing up the first cheap airship for one point is a mistake (which I made), you're better off getting a second useful card at the beginning.

I look forward to putting two sets together (like I did with San Juan) to enable 5 to 8 people to play!

I thought I would like this game.  Unfortunately it reminded me of a love scene from a teenage coming of age movie, it was quick and awkward, ended abruptly and on accident, and left the players feeling empty.  It seemed the game ended before it truly finished developing.  In truth it ended accidentally and I probably shouldn't have ended it.  On the other hand, there was nothing I could have done to prevent the person who should have ended it from ending it.  This is a dice rolling game with mechanisms similar to "To Court the King".  You roll for various dice abilities and then when you have the dice you want you roll for contracts and/or blimp contracts.  The game ends when there 1 or fewer contracts in each of 4 piles or when the 4 pieces of the blimp are built.  This means it could end in as few as 8 contracts which is how it ended for us.  I suspect being 3 newbies we probably didn't develop good strategies but still the game allowed us to end it before we got going.  That says to me there is something lacking in the end game conditions.

One four-newbie game behind and it felt quite good. It took some time, because of the new rules, but didn't feel too long.

The main mechanic is a quite simple dice throwing game with bonuses from purchased cards. It's almost a deck building game, if you think it in twisted way. :)

The idea is to build airships (zeppelins) by throwing dice. You can also purchase different cards instead of airships, they make getting the airships and cards easier or provide points.

Not bad at all, looking forward to see this in the future.

Updated after third game, last two games lasted 35-45 minutes, which is good length for the game. Above notes still correct.

This game reminded me very much of To Court The King.  Sort of a Yahtzee on steroids - using dice and manipulating how many and what scores you can get to get VPs.  While I quite like TCTK, in my experience it is a bit more dense and confusing (much like the designers other notable game Race for the Galaxy).  Airships feels very intuitive and I think where I have had difficulty playing with family gamers with TCTK, Airships would be much more warmly received.  Recommended as a light to moderate filler plus game.

RATING: 8
First play - 4 players - Dice rolling, gradual buildup game. Similar to To Court the King (lowered my rating to TCtK now) but I like this theme better. It has cooler bits as well (dirigible, flags, player boards). I kind of ran away with the game as I think I may have missed my roll just once. I had to use a 3-flag re-roll a few times and I succeeded on all of those. This is a good game to introduce to new gamers who think Yahtzee (blech!) is cool.

RATING: 7.5
Risk-management game using dice: the trick is to roll high only when you need it. Doesn’t really make sense, so yes, you can also call it push-your-luck game with mechanism to compromise luck.

This game is well-designed. There are enough variability, and two end-game triggers makes the game more dynamic. Not really my taste, though, so this game is leaving my collection.

RATING: 5
For people who like dice games, but are tiring of the roll-three-times-and-pray style of the Yahtzee derivatives, Airships should fill that niche.  This is more like a civ game, where you're developing a machine over the course of several turns, making it more powerful and more efficient as the game progresses.  The dice are essentially tools, and since you only get to roll them once, you'd better make sure that your machine is polished before you decide to go after a particular card.  After the disaster that was Queen's previous dice game (Lucky Loop), Airships is a breath of fresh air to show they're able to redeem themselves.

Another dice game...dice seem to be the new toy for Eurogames recently.  Still,  big-name designer - will this prove to extend his "hit streak" past one and a half (PR and SJ)...  Not much buzz,  but the buzz has been mostly positive.  Seems to cut down the physical complexity (variable setup)   and  player downtime of To Court the King (one roll rather than Yahtzee reroll/locking),  so definitely of interest.  A bit on the expensive side though - higher end than the usual "filler-size" game,  so currently on the "try before judgement" pile.

Free pickup at BGG.con. I read that it was a bit of a dice chucker and thought it might turn out to be a surprise hit. Unfortunately, no so. Rating based on a 2P game. The game end condition was a little confusing (one airship or one airship in each runway totaling up to four airships). While a light dice chucking engine builder sounds enjoyable, this just fell flat for us. It felt too long to be a filler but wasn't interesting enough to be anything else. 

Again, definitely not a bad game. But for a cult-of-the-new guy, there wasn't enough here to make me want to revisit the game. After one play, I'm planning to get rid of it as I don't have any desire to play again. There are just too much great games (or interesting looking yet-to-be-played games) for me to give this one any more time.

A fairly unique "power-up" dice game that is much more enjoyable than To Court the King. In contrast to TCTK, there's very little downtime - unless someone drastically overthinks their turn.

The game could have been made entirely without boards, however, which means that Airships could have sold for $15 rather than $25.

RATING: 6
Nice quick dice rolling game. The weighted dice add a little to the dice rolling. If you fail to win a new card, you get a +1 token for the next turn. 3 of the +1 tokens can be turned in for a extra turn. Both nice touches.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). There are some decisions to make about which cards to go for and in which order, when to spend the bonus markers for extra turns, and so on, but the game length remains reasonable (which is good, since luck plays a role - it's a dice-based game after all).

I need to give this another chance, but it does sport one of my least favorite mechanics:  The die roll to overcome an obstacle.

Dice games rarely capture my fancy, mostly because they are often devoid of meaningful decisions.  You roll, tabulate the result and grab what you can (or in the case where you have to choose what to go for beforehand, you either make it or you don't).  The theme is decent and the concept is fresh.  Unfortunately there aren't much else to really grab my attention.

A clever dice game that is not as luck driven as it may appear. Unlike most dice games, in Airships players have to decide first what they are gonna do with the dice before rolling them. Build your engine and play the odds! 

Variant : Many players find that the game ends too quickly as they don't even have the time to start building the Hindenburg. I agree. I recommend playing with the following variant (suggested by Phoenixgeek - see the variant section here on BGG) : "the game will end either when the Hindenburg is built or only ONE blimp card remains across the 4 stacks (instead of 1 card or less in each stack)." It works great!

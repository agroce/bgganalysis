Boa,... das hätte ich nicht erwartet! Gekauft weil Pandemic auf der Schachtel stand. Bekommen haben wir dann tatsächlich Pandemic und doch eigentlich ein völlig Eigenständiges Spiel.
Die Grundmechaniken aus Pandemie sind klar wieder zu erkennen, wurden aber für das Thema leicht angepasst.
Gemeinsam versuchen wir zu verhindern dass die Niederlande nicht im Wasser versinkt. Dabei sind die Würfel nun keine Epedemien/Krankheiten mehr sonder Wasser. 
Liegen drei dieser Würfel in einer Region und sollte ein dritter hinzukommen (wie beim original) kommt es zur Überflutung - Randgebiete bekommen alle einen Würfel. Dies kann verhindert werden in dem wir als Aktion Dämme zwischen den Gebieten bauen.
Der Infektionsstapel ist nun der "Deichbruchstapel". Für jede gezogene Karte muss ein Deich in der gezogenen Region brechen - kann kein Deich brechen läuft Wasser rein (ein Würfel wird stattdessen platziert).
Ziel ist es Pumpwerke zu errichten (Abgabe von 5 Karten der jeweiligen Farbe).
Können keine Karten nachgezogen oder Wasserwürfel platziert werden, verliert man das Spiel.

Für mich steht jetzt schon nach einer Partie fest dass es eines der besten Spiele ist die es schaffen die Mechanik so eng mit dem Thema zu verknüpfen. Selten ein Spiel gespielt was sich so Rund angefühlt hat.

Rising Tide is another installment in the series of the world championships editions: each year Asmodee releases a version tied to the location of the last WC, designed by Matt Leacock together with an author from that country.

This one has a very interesting new mechanic: floods originate in the sea, and spread to neighboring locations in a way that is at the same time Pandemic-like and very novel.
There are also many ways to customize the difficulty of the each single game, both with the number of Rising Tide cards, and with custom objective cards.

Rising Tide is definitely the most gamer’s version of Pandemic, and one of the best!

Two plays in:

Surprised at how much I enjoy this game, the small tweaks on the Pandemic formula works fantastically here. The water flow mechanics and sea level rise combine to make the game continuously tense and interesting.

I wouldn't recommend playing with just the base 4-color game, it really opens up and feels like it's meant to be played with the population/objectives "variant" (and 5 objectives feels like it should be the standard). Mayyybe play the base way once if all players in your group are new.

Second game, we had a situation where everything looked great, we were on a great path to get our four objectives, getting half the population put in place in the red/red/yellow/green 9 population objective, barely any water on the board...and a single storm raised the water level to 3, half the dikes broke in the northsea, and all but two water cubes were suddenly on the board and we're fighting for survival.  Taught us to plan ahead for the storms better.

Rising Tide adds a few extra layers of strategic options and puts a very thematic and interesting twist on the classic. 

In our first game we had more discussion regarding our next moves than any other game of pandemic.

I think if you're a fan of pandemic and either like this setting or want a little bit more of a challenge, this fits that well.

It also helps the game comes with several variants which makes the game more difficult. It feels like it comes with an expansion right out of the gate.

Another beautiful pandemic variant in the same line as Iberia. Just as with Iberia this game shakes up the formula and adds a lot of variability in the box. I really like the setting of this one as I live in the Netherlands.

RATING: 8
Cool, slightly more strategic spin on the classic Pandemic where instead of battling 4 diseases, you're trying to prevent flooding.  This has more nuances than the classic game, as allowing water to spread in strategic ways can be a good thing.  There are a few more actions to take, like creating pumps.  The game comes with a recommended first objective (building 4 structures that each come with their own special ability), but also includes separate objective cards and population cubes that provide other intriguing ways to play.  it's a little more fiddly than Pandemic (mainly because of how pumps activate each turn and how water spreads), but I like it better.

A different spin on the core Pandemic mecahnics - this one feels harder and the encroaching floodwaters seem somehow more doom-laden than the stacks of 3 disease cubes in more traditional Pandemics. Pronouncing all the Dutch placenames is like a super-hard minigame for the non-polyglots among us though...

Played the game during Essen spiel 2017.

The theme is nice and seems, at first sight, very different from the classic Pandemic.
In fact, the game mechanics feel less innovative than the Iberia version.

As usual the game material is beautiful and of very good quality but the board is quite hard to read, the main reasons being:
- the shape of the regions (with long and narrow ones)
- the presence of the small wooden sticks that represent dikes
- the names of the regions for people who don't know much about Netherlands geography

Also, the flow rules can be misunderstood and seems to need clarfication regarding the sea/region difference.

I've played this enough to finally give it a rating. I love that it tried to do something new with the Pandemic formula, but it is insanely easy to beat once you get a strategy down (focus on the dikes!). After that first loss, I have yet to lose a game and I've played half my games on Heroic. The 12 Objectives definitely up the difficulty, but this whole "challenge" feels tacked on. Of the 12 Objectives, 4 tasks are the same as in the base game, so those are lame. 2 are building Objectives, also boring. 2 are water control, which are just annoying. And 4 are a new population mechanic. Those are somewhat interesting, but extremely annoying in that population centers cover more than one color, so you spend more time looking at those Objectives than in actually populating those regions. Plus, these Objectives and the water control Objectives are way too reliant on luck. If the cards aren't going your way, good luck. I feel this population mechanic would've been an interesting addition to the too-easy base game, but they did not develop this at all.

One more issue: I preordered both the Survival Series games because I've been all over Europe and love playing maps of places I've been. I subtracted half a point because this map isn't about the cities I have seen but the regions. And not current Provinces, which I'd probably recognize, but historical municipalities! I want to travel to Rotterdam and Den Haag, not no Delfland! (Plus, the whole region thing takes way too long to come to terms with! So fiddly!)

Tentative 7 on this one. I'm not as wowed with this as I was Iberia, I believe, as the overall difficulty seems far easier and the turn-end maintenance higher.

While I find most of the ideas good, some are too luck dependent to be predictably effective tactically. For example, the hydrolics have wonderful effects, however, luck of the draw, and the sheer need to just build them (without regard to efficacy) detracts from the baked in abilities. 

For future installments we will definitely be "wait and see" rather than just pull the trigger.

First impression after one 2p game.  My favorite Pandemic.  Beautiful, the mechanics are simple yet very evocative, very thematic.  It offers an interesting new puzzle, different enough to bring some variance to the Pandemic series.  I really enjoy the way the game looks as it plays.

I have read many complaints about the map and I did not personally experience any problems reading the map.  I like the fact that it's not abstracted, the real geography and nomenclature makes the game all the more immersive.  The pounding of the sea against the dikes, the flooding of the rivers, it is all very evocative.  It gives a newfound appreciation for the incredible land reclamation work done by the inhabitants of the Netherlands.

This is the one that is the most different from regular pandemic. The game board might be a bit disturbing with the regions and the dikes but it all resembles well the ongoing fight of the dutch against the water. Not that easy and once the water starts flowing, it's difficult to get rid of it. Our first gameplay at easy level was a failure when sea level started to rise, the second time was a success. I can imagine that the pronunciation of the names can be very hard for non-dutch speakers. Thank god we can get away with it with our flemish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initially I really loved this new variant, but it does get a bit bogged down in the latter half of the game and I feel as though it outstays its welcome slightly.

One of my major grievances is the fact that the board should have been at least twice the size that it is to mitigate the difficulty in calculating water flow over a series of tiny provinces that are cluttered with ports, pumping stations, dikes, and water cubes. I have no idea how many times we missed things due to the fact that you just about need a forensic team to pore over the board to work out what's going where.

Some really nice mechanics and I will definitely be playing this again, but not without flaws. Might be a better app than a board game.

I don't have much basic pandemic experience. I have a little Pandemic Legacy experience. Generally speaking Pandemic is not a game or game system that gets me very excited. What brings this game to my attention is the co-designer Jeroen Doumen, who is a part of Splotter Games. Splotter's work always has my attention. So, let's talk Pandemic Rising Tide.

At the start of this game, you populate the whole board with wooden sticks which represent dykes holding back water. Then you flip some cards, and degrade the matching regions by removing dykes. If a region is out of dykes, then instead you add some water cubes. The game starts slow and then gets super intense, as once a certain number of events hit, the water level of the ocean goes up, and if you've lost dykes along the coast, water starts pouring in. In our game we lost due to running out of water cubes to place. I'm excited for my next go at it.

Something I found delightful about this game, other than the fact that the water cubes are this beautiful translucent blue, is that the water flows very logically. A spot with 3 water sets it's adjacent spots to 2 water. Spots with 2 water set their adjacent spots to 1 water. I also think the tools the game gives you to remove water are fascinating. One thing you can do is build a windmill sort of thing, which removes 1 water each turn from a spot the windmill can reach from a chain of contiguous flooded spots. It doesn't work at all if the mill is sitting on dry land. Where to build these things is a really compelling strategy decision.

You win the game when you construct all the buildings, which can be fairly far flung on the board, and when built they activate a strong one time ability. Other than those things, there are enough Pandemic mechanisms shining through that players familiar with Pandemic were able to jump right in and play.

Another great addition to the Pandemic line. Takes many elements from the original game but adapts it to a new location with new challenges making for a fresh puzzle. I have minor complaints about the map--I wish the dikes and regions were a bit easier to follow, but it's not so bad as to make the game unplayable--it just makes for a few more moments during the game trying to decipher the board state. The actual gameplay though is really intriguing, and it's a very cool touch that the game essentially includes an expansion with it in the form of varying objectives and additional mechanics.

In terms of estetics I really like the graphic design of the cards and some details on the board. The board seems still pretty, but it is quite busy...

This one is probably the most complex Pandemic iteration - don't misunderstand me, it is not a heavy game, but there seems to be more going on here.

What I liked in Iberia was the option to occasionally take preventive measures - here prevention is even more pronounced.

You can pump water out and/or build dikes - pumping helps only if there isn't to much water nearby, since it'll spill over if there are no dikes between the regions.

But when building diles you also have to think how good they are positioned to prevent to much spilling when things go wrong, beside the "normal" thinking about the number of them in the regions. And to further complicate thinks you can sometimes make your own windmill pumps to become ineffective, since you can block their pumping paths.

I like the puzzle more than in other non legacy versions of pandemic, but sadly the game is more fiddly - dikes, water, spilling, population, floods and 6 - 8 storm cards (the equivalent of epidemics) to shuffle in during setup.

Currently I rank it closely to Iberia, but I'll play with the variing objectives more and that might furter increase my rank later.

Excellent addition to the Pandemic line.  Even though it uses many of the same core mechanisms, it's different enough to distinguish itself from any other Pandemic/Forbidden game.  Figuring out the right way to manage water flow is really interesting and fun.  The additional challenges are a great way to change up the game, too.  I'm looking forward to more plays of this.

As a Pandemic fan I was intrigued by the look of this one. After a couple of play throughs I'm impressed. It's definitely Pandemic, yet there's a different feel, and in some ways the Pandemic mechanism actually feels more thematically compatible with holding back water than fighting disease. I like the spreading water mechanic, though it can be easy to miss areas that water should flow into and area boundaries not always clear or easy to work with for ease of play (although I appreciate that this is for historical reasons). More difference to original Pandemic than Iberia. If you like Pandemic and want a different implementation then this is well worth a try.

I'm a fan of the Pandemic games, although have grown a bit tired of the base game.  Rising Tide makes some pretty major changes to the base mechanics that makes it feel very fresh.  You still get 4 actions, draw 2 cards, potentially draw a Pandemic (Storm!) card, and draw from the bad deck at the end of every turn.  But beyond that, it is a very different game.

Instead of curing diseases, you are building a network of dikes in 19th century Netherlands, which has successfully used dikes to keep the country dry despite being largely below sea level.  I am a civil engineer that has worked on the design of dikes and flood management, so the theme is right up my alley.

Mechanically, everything is tied to the theme.  Water primarily comes in from the Ocean where, if your dikes fail, water floods to connecting regions.  If the Ocean is level 3 (3 water cubes), adjacent regions without dikes will fill to level 2, then regions adjacent to those will fill to level 1.  Super simple and thematic, and it can make losing a key dike truly devastating.  Additionally, floods can occur inland and spill into adjacent regions.

Instead of curing 4 diseases, you build 4 major hydraulic structures.  Similar to base Pandemic, you need to collect cards of the same color and go to the right region.  Each structure gives you a one time bonus when built that can really save your bacon.

The one other major change are that you can build pumps.  Pumps will automatically remove one water cube from any region that the pump is connected to hydraulically.  These are great and can be very useful, but do you no good of the dikes are broken anyway and it just keep flooding.

Overall, this is a refreshing twist on the theme that works fantastically with the mechanics.  I think the board looks nice (some people have complained), but it is a bit jumbled in some places.  One other aspect that is a bit weird is that all of the regions have crazy Dutch names.  So, everyone has to try and flail about trying to figure out the pronunciation.  But anyway, these are picking nits.  A great addition to the Pandemic line!

Got to play this this week and I have to say I was not a big fan. I will probably buy it (played at a gaming cafe) because I own every Pandemic made, including both original printings and newer printings of vanilla Pandemic and On the Brink. 

I found it fiddly, and being a dirty American, I found it difficult to talk about strategy with my fellow players when I can't recognize or pronounce or visually locate the regions. I agree with Zee (Dice Tower, who incidentally also used the word "fiddly") on the color scheme and...well...accurate-but-wiggly-line map making it harder to parse the regions to figure out what touches what, what is closer to another, and how each region interacts with another.

It was also very easy to accidentally bump the many cubes and dikes and not realize you did it and then wonder where it was supposed to be in the first place. Cleanup with parsing water flow felt like a lag/slowdown at the end of each round, making the whole game feel sludgy.

We won handily but very very VERY slowly. I prefer Iberia as I feel it is similarly a different puzzle to vanilla; but less clean-up phase between rounds to slow it down, and a cleaner visual space to tackle.

Different take on the basic pandemic mechanics requiring experienced players to rethink old strategies and come up with some new ones.

8 additional objectives and 7 roles with rules for up to 5 players add a ton of replayability on top of the basic variance inherent in the pandemic engine.

I didn't get Iberia or the other basic variants or expansions, but I'm really enjoying the novelty of this one.

RATING: 8
The first game; 'Pandemic : Rising Tide', is a different take on the original and derivative games around protecting the world against a dangerous pathogen, except this time, the threat is from the sea that looms beyond the flatlands of the Netherlands....The game is set in the late eighteenth century where the country has been protected by a series of dykes and wind-powered pumps but the old technology is falling short of the demands placed upon it. This is where the players come in. 

Their mission, should they choose to accept it, is to form a committee of works of the best technicians across a number of fields at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, and to co-ordinate an upgrading of the outdated protective defences along the coast and within the hinterlands as well. The plan arrived at is to construct four modern hydraulic structures in strategic locations that will help you defend the country from being reclaimed by the ocean. This is the first mechanic similarity. 

This is achieved by players co-operating to gain a set of five cards of the same colour and building these modern-day saviours at precise locations throughout the country. As the tidal waters ebb and flow with the turbulence of the North Sea, our gallant collective must keep a watchful eye on leaks to the dykes and the storms that brew and cause even greater damage. In our game, five of these cards were in the top third of the deck, so it did not end well. The Netherlands became much smaller after that! 

Each turn, players take two cards, that as with the original Pandemic, provide a mixture of locations of different regional colours as well as some specific special action cards. As with the original, there is an optimum mix of character professions, but these had already been selected by the time I arrived, so I wasn't sure what means to choose the four we used had been. I know we were relying a lot on our unique skills just to 'tread water' so that told me we were up against it although it seemed so tranquil for the first few turns.....

After each player takes their turn, moving, repairing dykes and using unique abilities, they follow a turn order that allows for pumps built to return it to the seas and inland waterways where it should be as well as drawing an ever increasing number of regional location cards where dykes can burst and flooding spreads. The cumulative effect of water at higher levels cascading down into lower lying areas is what does for you in the end. It retains all the hallmarks of a race against time as its predecessors. 

Water levels in a region are represented by cubes, and as the water containment systems currently in place begin to fail, more water cubes are added to the board. To successfully build the four hydraulic structures needed to win a game of Pandemic: Rising Tide, is a big ask, in my opinion, without the right tools for the job and a better spread of storm cards, but the deck was well shuffled, so that's the luck of the draw. You win some, you lose some. The blurb about predicting the flow and manipulating it is complete hogwash! 
Don't feel guilty when the water inundates you after multiple storms and you've run out of special action cards and used up all the water cubes, because then you know your house won't be where you left it, for sure, and you've just enlisted into the navy! We had a plan, a good plan, and had the foundation stone for the first hydraulic plant when it all went to hell, and as Canute I found to his cost, no matter how hard you concentrate, you cannae turn back the seas..... 

A good game which should be very easy for regular players of the Pandemic series should be able to pick up straight away. I would play again, shuffling the cards myself ????, as we played on the 'standard' setting, but with those odds, it may as well have been the 'extreme' setting. It scored some of the highest figures in the UK Games Expo play test games so far - a 19/25 for me - so a good addition to the stable. Let us never speak of the flooding fiasco again...

First two plays, really enjoying the new theme, speaks to the engineer in me. Instead of curing diseases you're building projects (4-6 of 12 different ones in the variant) and fighting back the rushing water with constantly failing dykes and frantic pumping. A more interesting variation than Iberia, which is closer to the original. Works very well.

Delightful hand-made quick dexterity game with interesting tactical elements.  Excellent value for money when you consider it takes Gavin two days to hand-make each one.

For fans of dexterity games like Crokinole, this game should definitely be on the radar.  It is actually 2 games in 1 (Jam and Sumo are 2 variants and the combined game JamSumo is playing both as a set).  Game play is straight forward dice flicking.  Games are quick and a interesting mix of skill (ability to either knock opponents off the board or get your dice into the hole) and luck (what value your dice end up showing when you "lose" a round).  It's an odd mix of skill and luck that seems like it shouldn't work, but in the end works remarkably well.  Add in the bonus that the game's since is much more convenient to haul around than a large Crokinole board and you have a portable, approachable, dexterity game.  Very solid fun (and very well made too!).

Genre Crokinole.
Dobbelstenen in het gaatje krijgen of juist niet.
Dobbelstenen van de andere verplaatsen of van het bord gooien...

Wel plezierig.
Blijkbaar op 2 uur uitverkocht in Essen.
Mooi materiaal wel.

Yet another wooden hand crafted masterpiece from Gavin. A perfect game for playing down the pub. Takes seconds to teach but generates such a lot of laughs. Gavin has a unique talent for taking a simple concept and creating games of skill and strategy. This is the latest to be generally released but he has more classics to come. 

Gav needs to pinch those elves off the shoemaker to churn these games out faster.

A delightful, small footprint cross between Tumblin Dice and Crokinole.

Only played once, but I ended up laughing a lot while playing, which is a good thing.   It is pretty humorous to send opponent pieces flying off the board in a violent manner.

I don't see anything exciting in this title.
If You search for dexterity game, then I suggest for example Crokinole.
If dices draw You to this game, then Tumblin-Dice looks a lot more fun.

Such a simple game, but it's a blast. I think I enjoy the "Sumo" game more than "Jam," but both together make this a sweet dexterity game that takes very little table space.

Dex dice flicking game, actually two different games Sum is slamming your die into others and Jam is trying to get them in a hole in the center to get the lowest score.

This is an extremely enjoyable dice-flicking game. This games was an instant hit in our gaming club after buying it in Essen 2015. It also looks great in a display  cabinet, next to our copy of Meisterdiebe.

Very simple rules and with a couple of tweaks you can develop interesting variants. 
In Sumo, we use the variant that each of the dice starts on a different number (so you have 1 to 6 on the board). This way you have the more 'agressive' dice (lower numbers) and the dice you may try to protect as much as possible (higher numbers).

Tumblin' Dice meets Crokinole + anti-Crokinole on a beautifully made compact board. A nice dexterity game that I can appreciate without it displacing Pitchcar. Almost like arena combat.

Nice dicefiller on a gorgeous hardwood board. handmade.
great fun with a couple of friends. when you want to have a more confrontational game you can play the sumo variant where you have to get the other players' dice of the board.
worth every €

So this has become my go-to multi-player light game. Probably the easiest game I’ve ever taught with the only true barrier being people who just straight-up don’t enjoy dexterity games.

A beautiful presentation, it consistently  attracts onlookers and has become the most requested game among my casual gaming friends. I’m surprised at how well it scales regarding player skill and age; I’ve played in sessions where the player age ranged from 5-65 and all seemed to enjoy themselves.

Another decent flicking game I'll happily play again but won't miss as there's nothing outstanding and I don't find it particularly attractive. I rank it above Ice Cool but below Carabande, Carrom or Ascending Empires. Counting the pips on the dice introduces an uncontrollable luck factor while giving the scoring a necessary finer granularity.

An okay idea for a game. It would have been a lot more fun before there were such good other choices in flicking games. It feels derivative and lacks real excitement.

Diceflicking. The fun way to use dice. Two parts: one flicking away the dice of the other players and one aiming your own die into a hole. Requires a bit of dexterity.

Fun dexterity game.  Nice combination of precision / pool in the first round (Jam) vs attack and positioning in the second round (Sumo).

RATING: 6.5
Two short filler/dexterity games in one: 
Jam rating 7: some skill helps here to flick your dice into the hole.
Sumo rating 6: this is wild clash of dice on the little but very stable well produced wooden board. This is the less interesting game of the two.
Best of these games is the very small size. Easy to carry, you can play it anywhere.

Brilliantly simple and elegant too. The family love this dice flicking mayhem and getting them all to play the same game is a rare treat. Plays quickly but with two different games it really is a gem.

It's a small wooden elevated platform where the supposed sumo fighters will collide. This game is actually two completeley independent games whose scores you will add, but I see no reason to play only the game you like, and forget the other.

The first game is about flicking your 4 dice to push your opponents' dice out of the platform. The lone "survivor" scores the pips on his surviving die. The second game is a crockinole with dice.

The scoring system is very bad, but fortunately, the fun part of the game is playing it.

The platform is small and you can move it around; this is really helpful in order to flick comfortably.

Dippy dice dexterity with only a couple of problems - firstly the uncanny ability of some players to chain together a series of winning flicks in Jam, and secondly the wobbly board with no dice-collection underneath.

2 dex dice games. flicking dice- what more could you ask for? Try to know your opponents out of the ring. Very fun- if I can find a copy as a reasonable price point I will pick it up.  I like this kind of game though.

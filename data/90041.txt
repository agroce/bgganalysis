RATING: 7
Rating based on one 2 player game.
Really liked how the mechanisms worked of a kind of circular set of actions and then a big cash-in in round 3, with the clever war mechanic on top.

2 player felt sometimes quite negative and I think 3 or 4 player would be a nicer game.

Just got my hands on this one. Component quality is good and the rules seem simple enough but very interesting. At 19 euros it's a real bargain, too! Now I just have to find time to play it a few times before I can give any kind of rating. 

First impression after a couple of two-player games: 7.5. Pretty interesting and well-working euro, but the two-player experience is a bit dry.. most likely will be much better with three or four players. Have to play more.

Pretty uncomplicated game, but fun and lots of room for strategy.  The card action-then-trade stuff reminded me a lot of [b]Fortuna[/b].  It felt a little long and a little wish-rinse-repeat-y, but I'm definitely looking forward to trying it again.

RATING: 7
A nice compact game where you have 2 actions per turn and have to build farms (need gold from markets) or markets (need food from farms). I like the idea that many of the cards swap with one of the six in the pool, which allows some degree of card control over other players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a cleverly designed medium weight euro wherein players build their farming, mining, military and culture boards using card activations and exchanges with an ever- changing common pool of available cards to exchange for.  While perhaps the game has some limitations with respect to replayability, the game deserves a higher rating on BGG than its present number.  This game might serve nicely as a gateway game to introduce new gamers to thinking about resource generation and conversion economies.

Provisional rating based on one play.

The main game mechanics with actions that get "stored" by each player and how the available actions change over time are both quite interesting.

I had a good time playing but I'm worried about the balance of the goals, hoarding of the work-generating actions, and general replayability.  Definitely willing to play more to determine if these are problems or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good game, if I was to be critical I might say it is a little long (clocks in at up to 2 hours with 4 players) for what it is (a light/medium Euro). Quite a nice, engine building game which forces you to balance (you need gold to build food production and food to build gold production). Probably the heart of the game and certainly the best bit is that and allows you keep two actions to yourself, swapping them with other actions which are moving along a conveyor belt. You need to grab things you really need or deprive other players of them (though taking something means you have to give something else back) and it is painful to see an action you wanted dropping into the discard pile.

Too long and too repetitive. There are too many  production cards. On the other hand, the more important cards are scarce and can be easily blocked by the player who holds them first. Looks like it's half baked.

Principato is another souless euro.

I sooooo wanted to like this game and have been keen for a while to get it to the table. It looks fantastic, with nice art and components. On paper, it sounds like it will be great, I like the idea in principle of having limited options each turn in terms of actions. And there is the chance for multiple routes to victory, enhanced by the personal objective cards.

But it just didn't work out like that. There is very little interaction, with each player building on their own board, and the cards on the display are just not powerful enough to make denying them to an opponent a worthwhile use of an action. The action mechanism doesn't work well because there is not enough variety of action cards - they repeat each other over and over, so there is not much of a dilemma over what to do. The whole game lacked tension. Very disappointed for a game I was really excited to play.

I would never have guessed that this was from the same designer who made Eclipse – this is a much less grandiose little eurogame which is almost a filler due to its length (~30 minutes with 2 players). While I like Eclipse quite a bit (and I won’t make any comparisons to it from now on of course as the games are nothing alike), Principato isn’t an interesting game in my opinion. It’s quite repetitive, doesn’t offer many interesting decisions during the gameplay and is all in all just… bland and forgettable. There are so many euros out there today that euros need to do something special in order to stand out from the rest of the crowd, and Principato doesn’t do this. Granted, I’ve only tried it with 2 which BGG says is the best, so I cannot say how it plays with 4, but I would imagine it would be more or less the same (though the military aspect would be more interesting), only the game would last longer. You’re kind of forced to do some certain things throughout the game and it’s hard to specialize/diversify. So, the games tend to be similar, and it doesn’t help that there are very few ways to score points. I do like the hidden objectives, but those cannot save an otherwise quite boring game.

First impression: PRINCIPATO is a game of stripped down mechanics, nothing more than the core was left. This is not bad, but it leaves a problem, at least for me: If you don't really enjoy THIS mechanic, there is nothing more to love herein!

All in all, I find the game too simple. You can trace a strategy mosttimes, but this strategy is dictated by the two goal cards you got at the very beginning. If you don't try to fullfil at least one, you won't have a chance on winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A soulless and completely uninteresting title where two symmetrical resources are converted into each other; but where the options for the conversion are limited by various action cards which change all the time. There is so little variation in this game that it often feels like the game is playing you instead of the other way around. That the same author is capable of creating something like Eclipse is weird to say the least. I wish I could say more, but there's neither need nor reason to.

I love this game. It's got a good theme and smooth gameplay. It's simple in design and is not a complex game. My wife isn't much of a gamer and this is one that she enjoys. There are a couple of negatives. Sometimes the game gets a little bogged down in turn play. Also, it could be a little more elaborate. There are only a few options on each turn, if the cards don't fall right for you it can be a long game. More options would help this. An expansion would be great.

Principato has a cool card mechanic for doing actions on your turn.  I like that you build an engine and have hidden scoring.  But I don't think it does either one as well as it could have.  

The engine phase was a bit too long for me, and the hidden scoring seemed a little hit an miss when it came to being able to get the cards you needed to get hidden points.

A second play might help, now that I know the card distribution better.  I liked that the game plays fast and has a small footprint.  I think more plays would raise my rating a little, but there are just a lot more options out there.

Anyone who finds most light filler games to be a bit too light might well like this one. It's not a full-blown resource production and conversion game like Ora & Labora or Le Havre... but it's got a lot of those elements and it plays very quickly.

The BGG entry says the mechanics are card drafting, hand management, set collection and tile placement. Oddly, this game does not really have any of these mechanics (at least not exactly the way you'd probably assume). Basically, it's a role selection/action selection game where you produce two resources--food and money--in order to strengthen your army and produce works of culture.

Whoever best optimizes production and storage of resources (leading to strength and culture) will most likely win.

A bit hard to understand at first but quite enjoyable with three players at least. Sure, you're just pushing cubes around but you can do some cool moves here, such as making sure that great card gets removed t the end of your turn and so on. The only part that felt a bit strange is the military. Catapults seems the way to go, but perhaps it depends on how many are fighting for the military points and how much they want it.

This is one of those very pedestrian games with nothing even remotely exciting. The players need cards to perform actions, but they can have only two and thus must constantly exchange them with others in a central row. There is a significant amount of luck in which card is revealed in your turn and what is left for you by your opponents. The only other interaction is in comparing military strength at fixed and random points in the game.

The game uses a very basic two-resource system where you produce one type to build the constructions that produce or store the other type. You also use those resources to pay for your army and to get some culture tokens worth some victory points. Does that sound boring? It is, at least a bit. There is nothing new, the decisions aren't very interesting and the game overstays its welcome. On top of all that, it has a pasted-on and beaten-to-death theme. It is playable but ultimately forgettable, as there are just too many better games in the same genre.

Enjoyable Euro with, yes, cubes and, yes, victory points. Quite similar core mechanic to Notre Dame in that cards determine which actions you can take as opposed to the usual worker-placed-to-block-opponent method. Several different options to pick that might lead to victory, and with hidden objective cards there's an extra element of not knowing what exactly is most important to your opponent (but there's enough play-time to try to work it out from watching their turns carefully).

There's no reason anyone would go out and buy this game but every time I get it out to recycle, I end up keeping it.

Nice card mechanism, but one idea won't save the game. Principato is too repetitive and especially a way too long. It's luckdriven what comes to victory point cards = there is a big chance, that you won't get an opportunity to get the cards which one you'll need for. If I have to play it in the future, I would play it with three instead of four players - it works better that way.

A card drafting game where the cards you select are in the center and you must replace a card you currently have.  Effectively, you only have 2 cards in front of you the whole game.  You are trying to build a food and money engine while being able to store these.  At the same time you can gain militia, catapults and mercenaries to fight wars. 

The game is good but unlike other games I have played.  It is light enough to play with non-gamers but still appears to have toms depth.

Works well. With four players, initial game is likely a tad too long, but with experience the game plays in an hour or less, which is fine.

Balancing between engine building and point-scoring is interesting, and the action card mechanism is good. The game's a bit bland, though, very much a Just Another Soulless Euro game.

Indifferent.

Long and light in a bad way.. For the amount of time the game runs there are not a lot of avenues to explore.. Either score points from military or culture..

Most of the games mechanics are implermebted better in other games..

---- Prelimiinary thoughts ---- To be confirmed.

After reading the rules, the game seems to be a nice economic engine builder euro, simple but with a good action selection mechanism. The gameplay shows several problems:
-> Lack of choices: often, there's only one viable/ideal obvious option.
-> It's very easy to lock the next player from the cards he needs, but the rest of the players are untouchable for you.
-> Repetitive: you will be doing the same during all the game, and 1 hour seems a bit long for what it is.
-> Lack of replay value.

It's not a bad game, but I prefer deeper games that offer me more than this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (3 players): The core of the game is action selection system where you have 2 cards that grant actions to be played and those can be swapped with the pool of cards on the table. That seems fresh but actual gameplay didn't impress that much.

RATING: 6.5
Very, very nice: the essence of a lot of Euros boiled down into a set of simple actions and proving you don't need dozens of resources and options to make an effective and interactive worker placement game. The bonus cards, being deceptively hard to achieve for the large part, are the key element of secrecy that completes the game. One fairly significant downside is the amount of accounting required in the military phases, but given the level of open information and the inability to reckon the leading scores, this should encourage a bit of fair-minded competition

RATING: 6
Principato is a good game, with some aspects very similar to Seven Wonders. I am surprised by its low profile and relatively low ranking.

Players take turns drafting from a common pool of cards. But they are restricted to very small hands, and the central pool is in constant flux. A card is added and another removed each turn. Players build an economy producing both cash and grain, which are used to pay for troops and artworks. Several times the different troop strengths are compared, with the winners receiving victory points (very like 7 Wonders). Artworks score additional points at game end.

Principato is entertaining. Probably better with two or three players, rather than four, it suffers a little from the binding effect: you can effect the player after you by denying access to specific cards, but you cannot really impede the other players. And if you don't slow the next player, they will likely run away with the game. With more players it is also increasingly difficult to plan ahead, which sometimes leads to delayed turns. With 2 players it is fine.

Played the prototype. Very nice artwork! The gameplay is sort of smooth and makes you feel that you could build up some strategy. But somehow luck plays a bigger role than it seems to be at first sight. Actually there are always enough cards to choose from (7). But if you - as one of the other players does - need a special card to go on, but that certain card always shows up when its the other players turn, you can find yourself blocked for many rounds with no more chance to win. Thats what happened in our round... Anyway I liked the game anyway.

Build up your engine and then let rip to earn points. The game is all about the cards, which provide different options - build goods generators, build storage, generate goods, convert goods into soldiers (for VPs) and monuments (for VPs). But you can only ever have two cards in your display. So you find yourself doing a dance, using your current cards 'til you're done with them, and then swapping them out for the next type of action you need - building storage, generate some goods, build generators, generate goods, build storage in other type of good, generate goods, etc. Your decision is very much based on what card options are available in the display - will it likely be there next turn (ie can I afford to wait) or must I take it now to be sure of it, even though I haven't quite finished with the cards I have now. And this is the guts of the game. Unfortunately the game goes on far too long and this simple mechanic (and relatively simple decision process) can't sustain interest that long, when the same essential decision is being asked of you every turn - do I continue or swap to the next thing. Good for 45 mins, not so much for 90 mins.

RATING: 5
In Principato, players use action cards to build up their player board, both in terms of goods capacity and actual goods.  Additionally, players can spend these goods for military power, which is worth majority points during scoring phases, and culture tokens, worth straight points at the end of the game.  When used, action cards either go to the central supply, where they can be taken by other players, or back to the player's hand.  Overall, I found this game disappointing.  The idea of trading cards with a central offer when you used them seemed clever and unique, but it really lacked in execution. It was just too easy to pounce on a "don't trade it in when you use it" card and sit on it for the bulk of the game, denying that power to anyone else. And while I liked the card play, the rest of the game was pretty dull.

RATING: 6
Simple but fun game from 2011, that feels like an older design: it's fairly clean, without a million ways to score points and lots of different paths to victory and set collection and other minigames thrown in for good measure. You're simply building up, collecting cubes and buying stuff with them, and at the end compare points.

What's rather clever is that you always have two cards in your hand; most of your actions will be playing a card. The ones that give you cubes you immediately exchange for a new card, but the ones that let you spend cubes (for buildings, that either give you more cubes or increase the max cubes you can have) stay in your hand. If you don't want them anymore, you have to spend an action to exchange them. New cards are on a 'conveyor belt', if you don't take them they might be gone.

What I like least about the game is that it's not terribly exciting; every turn you're pretty much doing the same thing. Which would be perfect for a 25 minute game, but this is more of a 90 minutes game; and in that category there are a lot of games that are more interesting.

RATING: 3
The description didn't bowl me over (renaissance Italy, individual player boards) but even that didn't prepare me for how little fun this was. The one clever idea is the action selection mechanism: each player has two action cards in front of them, which they can activate or exchange with cards in a common row in the middle. But the actions themselves are dull and repetitive, killing whatever tension this mechanic might create. In that respect, it's rather like the Speicherstadt, only the one clever idea is less clever and the dull rest of the game is more dull.

What really murders the game though, is that the two main resources are completely symmetrical. There are buildings that cost gold and make food, and there are buildings that cost food and make gold; there are soldiers who you pay with food, and soldiers you buy with gold, and so on. This makes it impossible to specialise, and the only thing driving the players to do anything differently is the two secret goals they get dealt at the beginning of the game.

Nice, fairly light game similar to 7 Wonders; not a brain burner. Best wih 2 players since it is easier to implement your strategy.  With more players, the luck factor plays a bigger part and thus, could be more frustrating.
Great for the casual gamer.  Could get boring after many plays, but that's not an issue with me since I don't have time to play a lot.

RATING: 8
The card play and swap mechanic is clever, the rules are simple, and the game is fun and plays quickly. However balance is achieved by greatly limiting the actions presented on the cards, limiting the scope of what can be done and sometimes making it seem as though the game is playing you. This game reminds me of The Speicherstadt (although the mechanics are not as unique), i.e. simplification achieved at the expense of variety and depth of cards. It's certainly worth a few more plays and Tahkokallio is a talented designer worth keeping an eye on.

Jogo engraçado, simples e tão complexo ao mesmo tempo, mas que parece resultar de um projecto inacabado, com algumas lacunas insólitas e que facilmente poderiam ter sido melhoradas: 1 - Colocar os tiles ao estilo "totoloto" é simplesmente não usufruir do seu potencial; 2 - Dar pontos de poderio militar a quem tem um valor militar negativo é um insulto; 3 - Uma hora e meia a 3 horas de duração, para um jogo no qual que se passa a vida a fazer as mesmas acções, não abona muito a seu favor; 4 - Ter um baralho dividido em três fazes, e algumas cartas serem transversais a todas, ou é falta de imaginação, ou é uma arma de destruição maciça; 5 - Devia de haver mais espaço para os tiles rectangulares (sei que não são limitativos), mais que não fosse, para honrar a carta de pontuação em que são precisos 3 conjuntos de 3 variedades para obter a recompensa máxima; 6 - A produção devia ter sido mais cuidada e tirado proveito da arte, que até acaba por ser mal empregue devido ao tamanho dos tiles - moedas e alimentos temáticos seriam também muito mais apelativos do que cubos e mais cubos...

Seemingly a "generic euro", but we enjoy it! Attractive bits. The central mechanism of trading cards between your hand and the central queue, which loses its head card and gains a new card at the tail each turn, introduces some interesting tactics. There is definite luck of the draw in what order the cards come out, but still plenty of room for intelligent planning and tactics. I also like that there is not a huge number of various special action cards, but rather a small easy-to-teach set of card types.

13-07-2014. Rated after one play. Principato is a nice game in which you try to effectively draft action cards from the center row to exchange with cards you need later. You try to build an economy to sustain a larger army than your competitors. You play through 3 rounds, scoring after each round and twice during. 

Not a bad game. Actually, quite a good game although parts are clunky. I REALLY like the action drafting, but the choices are quite limited. Also, in the last round identical
cards from round 1 show up that are useless in round 3. Progression was there, but could've been more. Unfortunately the artwork and design is ugly and components are shoddy. This makes me feel that with a little more love the game could've been so , ich more than it currently is.

Solid little game. Very clever cardplay with a lot of potential for interaction through denying opponents actions if you're paying attention. Nice engine building and resource management, with multiple paths to victory. The choice of whether or not to actively engage heavily on military or artistry is a nice balance. I like how the player with the most forces has to decide how many they'll send out, followed by other players with less. There's a lot of tension in deciding. The end goals are always welcome and give you something specific to play around with. It also has nice artwork, solid components, plays fast, and it's cheap. We both enjoyed it quitr a bit, keeper.

RATING: 8
*Strongly* reminiscent of [b]Fortuna[/b] (and released the same year), both are light-weight, engine-building euro games that utilize an "activate-then-exchange" mechanism for its action cards. Ironically, our group played both games back-to-back and were astonished as to their similarities - if you played one you have the basic core concept of the other.

Which one is better?

Well, [b]Principato[/b]  has no dice rolling so right away it's less random... But, the action cards in [b]Principato[/b] is more random due to its card drafting mechanic as opposed to [b]Fortuna[/b]'s constant set of twelve actions to swap between, therefore actually making it difficult to plan ahead while long-term planning is quite possible in [b]Fortuna[/b]... That being said, the secret goal cards are not as overpowered and have a strict limit of two per a player in [b]Principato[/b] - whereas a single player could binge on collecting goal cards in [b]Fortuna[/b] - therefore making [b]Principato[/b] much more balanced... But, [b]Fortuna[/b] is clearly the more streamlined of the two, making it a breeze to teach newcomers...

It's a toss up!

[b]Fortuna[/b] may be the better [i]gateway[/i] game due to it being more streamlined while [b]Principato[/b] may be the better [i]gamer's[/i] game due to having slightly more control and complexity.

Both will remain in my collection as I am a sucker for engine-building games and both have enough unique subtleties to prevent both experiences feeling the same - only the same flavor.

[b]Update - 08/2015:[/b] After two years, the game still holds up. There's some questions now about the goal cards being truly balanced, and sometimes a long-term strategy can be immediately foiled within the first game year by an inadvertent play by opponents (such as them sitting on the capult cards), but despite some perceived imbalances the player always has options and never feels like their your situation is hopeless. I also love that by the end of the game, each player seems to have established an entirely different "engine" to generate victory points. I'm bumping this up half a point to an 8!

There's nothing to like in this game, in my opinion. Gameplay is very repetitive, cards are the same over and over, the structure is unbalanced as some players may not get the same possibilities as others, scorings (some) are randomly timed and it lasts 30 minutes more than it should! Uninteresting and dull. 
The only good idea here is the trading versus non trading cards but even this idea, with all of the possible 'trade for the same card you played before' rulling, doesn't work.

Perfectly adequate cube-farming efficiency game -- acquire gold to increase food production and food to increase gold production, but find time along the way to pay both to acquire military units (5x military scoring rounds for in-game VP) and paintings, books and sculptures for end-game VP.

The action-selection/exchange mechanism works very well and every turn is tense, but... the resources are symmetrical but opposite and required by all players, so all players end up doing much the same thing with varying degrees of efficiency. Somewhat troubling in an efficiency game is the randomness inherent in the card draw, both the action tableau and the scoring cards (I'm not entirely sure the combinations are balanced).

An enjoyable enough game but firmly second-string. I'd love to see the core mechanism recycled in a game deserving of it.

I think this game is probably better with more than two. It's a light card driven economic engine building/military stength game. On your turn you either activate a card (which might force you to exchange the card), exchange a card or take a wild resource cube. A lot is dependent on when the cards come out. Overall I thought it was interesting, but it felt a little lacking.

The first half to two-thirds of the game ranks higher - maybe as high as 7. However, after that it gets very repetitious, as you are just turning the crank on your engine over and over.

Good value for money, agreeable artwork and components...too bad the game itself isn't more exciting. At least with four players, the luck of the draw is too dominant for me. You can set up 90% of a VP engine, but never be able to profit from it due to the fact that you cannot get your hands on the last part (it is picked up by the player next to you, who then makes it disappear from the table by using it). Might be a bit better with just two players actually.

A small-scale euro with nice components and pretty straight-forward rules. A bit dry on theme.

Card draft exchange system where you only have two cards in play at any time. Three ages of cards. Acquire art or structures or build military to collect sets for scoring objectives.

Tidy little euro. It's like kingsburg meets Notre Dame without dice. Buy farms and banks; put yellow and green cubes on them; sell for a profit to buy VPs (books and artworks for palace). Apparently confrontational as scope for spoiling others' plans - but isn't that why nearly every euro has a military element?

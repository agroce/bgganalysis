It was ok.  Doesn't bring many new ideas to the genre and relied on too many 'trick' puzzles (won't explain because of spoilers).

Deckscape offers a series of puzzles in a small package. You have the puzzles on cards, and once you think you’ve figured out the solution the card is flipped over to see whether you got it right and then you proceed to the next problem. Wrong answers are calculated as minuses at the end of the game, and your total score determines whether you won or lost. All that is provided is a deck of cards and there is no need for additional gizmos or electronic apps , which I think is a very clever format for the game. Admittedly here you lose the possibility to try a puzzle several times which makes Deckscape a pure single use game with zero replay value. The fun factor is totally dependent on how you find the puzzles, i.e., are they clever, frustrating or easy. Mechanically the core system offers a solid foundation for creating adventures only limited by the authors’ imagination.

Personally I found this particular challenge to be ok. Not too tricky and all puzzles made sense. I think there was no or only a few traditional math problems which was nice. It was more about pattern recognition and seeing the obvious, or sometimes the not so obvious, things in the cards that gave away the answer. 

Whether you should buy the game depends totally on how much you are ready to invest into your personal entertainment. Here, Deckscape should not be compared with traditional boardgames from which you expect some replay value. Instead Deckscape could be compared with going to movies for example. You pay a certain amount of money to keep yourself entertained for a predetermined amount of time.

This was my first Escape Room in a Box.

I had fun playing this game, just it made me realize what that my gut feeling was true: if I want to play a board game, I want to play a board game; if I want to play an escape room, I want to go to an escape room. The hybrid of the two isn't really something I care for.

It's not that it doesn't capture the feel, because the game absolutely does... it's just that the escape room experience for me is so much more about the environment than about the puzzles.

The game consists in a deck of cards that tries to emulate the experience of a real life escape room.

It has been released almost simultaneously as another couple of games in the same genre, capitalizing at the same time on the success of Legacy boardgames (with their "one shot and can't ever be replayed" feature) and of course on the popularity of the escape rooms.

The play experience is good, even if the puzzles are quite easy to solve.
The comparison with Unlock (another escape room simulator, released by Asmodee) is inevitable, and for my group of experienced gamers (and veterans of many escape rooms) Unlock is definitely better, with its nonlinear presentation of puzzles. It feels more challenging, and for a game meant to be played just once, that is a big plus.

Anyway, I predict Deckscape will have a decent amount off successs: the absence of rules, immediate immersion and manageable challenge seem a good mix of ingredients for success...

Game is good. I kind of lack the history and scenery from Unlock, and some puzzles were just too hard for us even after we read the explanation we discussed if we would be able to solve this without help in any way.

This was an enjoyable escape room experience, but it only gives you one chance at each of the puzzles and you are either right or wrong with your guess. Either way you continue. This part of it left a bad taste in my mouth and definitely puts this series in last place among the escape room type games i own. The unlock series is similar, but far better executed in my opinion.

Fairly decent escape room in a box. Definitely preferred the puzzles of Exit the Game and Unlock!, and felt they offered much more puzzle variety, as well as quality. Still rate the game a solid 7/10 and would be happy to recommend it to most gamers. It also has the bonus of being replayable, so can be sold/traded after playing.

RATING: 5
My least favorite "escape room" game.  The Unlock and Exit series have more interesting puzzles and a more elegant method of hiding solutions.  In this game you only get one chance to solve a puzzle, which I do not like as much.  Even the Thinkfun games are more fun than this one.

RATING: 8
Components: Solid artwork on oversized cards making it easy to see the details (in all but one case). I wish the Unlock! series used this size of card. I particularly like that the solutions show how the correct answer was arrived at, just to reaffirm that we did it correctly, or explain what we were missing.

Experience: The 5th escape room series I've tried, and now among my favorites. Having four decks of cards is an interesting and elegant way to pace the game, giving us many puzzles to shift our attention among. The “what do you do?” style questions on the cards lend themselves to much more open-ended types of puzzles that I've seen in the other four series. So many puzzles and so many types of puzzles in this game. Lots of fun.

My only two complaints: one of the puzzles involved a detail on a card that was obscured in shadow; even with a magnifying glass I doubt we would have solved that one. And we got the final puzzle wrong because the game hadn't made clear to us what our goal was, so we made a decision based on an incorrect assumption.

I liked the fact that you are not ripping up components in this game and can give it to a friend/trade it afterwards. 

I've only played one other Escape Room game before (Unlock! The Island of Doctor Goorse), and this was a lot better: No annoying app to check for answers. You just flip the card to see if you are right or not, and if not you get an X and move onto the next card. That means you can never be completely stuck on something, even if you get hints. The riddles also were a lot better. They started out fairly easy but got more complicated towards the end. There were some where we had to discuss the answer or where we were stumped for a while. 

In the end it took us 49 minutes to play through it, and it felt like a breeze (would have guessed we played for 20-30 minutes). 5 players is slowly beginning to stretch this, I probably wouldn't recommend this for 6 players, but it can work.

RATING: 7
The biggest advantage this "escape room in a box" game has over Unlock or EXIT is that you flip each card when you're ready, and if you're wrong you simply add an X that affects your score at the end of the game. 

I liked that you didn't have to destroy anything in this game. That's an advantage over the EXIT series of games.

That said, I think I liked this less in general than EXIT (my favorite series) or Unlock. I can't explain it except to say that the puzzles were slightly less engaging. 

Still, this only left our collection because it's a once and done game.

Puzzles are easy, it is like the game is a tutorial session compared to the other escape room games. One of the biggest flaw is that you can only try to answer a puzzle once.

I think the best mechanic of this game is that you can have different endings.

A slightly different take on the escape room game (Compared to Unlocked and Exit, both of which I've played).  One one hand, I like how the structure lets you answer questions in ways you just can't in the other two games (Many of the puzzles are visual where you need to identify something in the picture which the other games don't really have a way to manage).  On the other hand, you can't get too creative when putting random items together or thinking really far outside the box.

It's also the easiest of the escape rooms I've played so far by a reasonable margin - but that's not inherently a bad thing depending on who you're playing with.

Entertaining escape room experience - seems rather easy so at times it goes rather fast but it has a lot of puzzles to solve against the time so in the end we went 4 minutes above the 1 hour limit. Not the best in the series but an enjoyable one that comes in a small package. Would like to play some more in the series.

Nice out of the box escape room game which is quite easy to complete but offer some challenging puzzles. It's amazing how much fun we had with just few cards and simple story behind it. Yes, it is a game for only one run through but if you buy it together with few people it's definitely worth the price.

It's a quite charming escaperoom. Not too simple, but it really does nicely on the - you're thinking to diffficult - thought for the puzzles. They are playable by everyone. Main downside of course is that you can play it only once. Second one is that there's no trial and error; you're either right or wrong about every puzzle. My husband and I solved it in 44 minutes (including bonus minutes for our errors)

Like Unlock this system attempts to deliver an escape room experience with just a deck of cards. This system does have a couple of ideas I really like. I like how the deck gets divided into multiple sections. This helps make it less linear and provides a sense of exploration. I also greatly appreciated how the answer to most of the puzzles were not just codes of some sort. I did find the flip a card over to see if the answer is right to be a bit off. Compared to the other systems it just felt uninspired. I also found that it was not always clear what they were getting to with some of the puzzles. I know there is one we guessed at and got right even though our reasoning was wrong, and there was one that we got wrong. Even after reading the back that explained it we were not really understanding how that was the right answer or how we were supposed to get to there. This is not my favorite escape room game system, but I still love the concept of these games.

Despite the large number of recent "escape room in a box" releases, I am not yet tired of them nor do I feel that the genre has become oversaturated or repetitious. There is still plenty of room for innovation and I am excited about what's still to come. Deckscape is interesting because it delivers the experience with a minimal set of components - a single deck of cards. While it may not provide a great depth of theme, it still delivers an interesting puzzle-solving experience in an inexpensive format. This isn't a bad thing since this type of game can really only be played once before being sold, traded, or given away. The puzzles within Deckscape are clever and unique, and the path through the game was not a single linear one as is the case with other similar games such as the Escape the Room series by ThinkFun. That's not to say those are those other games aren't good, it's just that the overall game is more fun and engaging when several players are able to work on different puzzles simultaneously. This also introduces more tension and the need for players to interact as they work separately - but still together overall - to solve the puzzle and complete the game successfully. Deckscape did that pretty well in the midgame and then become more single-threaded for the end, as expected. Overall, I really liked Deckscape and look forward to future releases in the series.

A good escape room in the decksploration format. However, it was a little bit too easy and falls behind the EXIT: titles.

In any case it should be an autobuy for anyone interested in the genre as there are not too many alternatives available.

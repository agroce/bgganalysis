I compare this to Fields of Fire in the sense that it's story left me feeling the same. It's (even) more abstracted than FoF and is much, much more luck reliant but it's fun to play if you don't fancy the rules slog that FoF requires every time you bring it out of the box.

Rating 7 - Have not made my mind up on this one yet. Seems fun but static and deadly. Need to invest more time.

Rating 4 - Give up. Its just not exciting enough. Played one scenario of UP Front and it blew this away. Up Front has more choices, interesting actions, infiltration, demo charges, variable terrain, tense action the list goes on. This one revolves around best shot wins.

the main flaw is that any card can be a move or a fire card. Whilst in UP Front you move and hope your opponent does not have a fire card and quite often they do not, you never know and that creates the tension. In Frontline that tension is missing.

There are some nice ideas here but overall its a fail. Sorry tried to like it, its the first game from DVG that I feel disapointed in. Shame...

RATING: 6
I have played it a handful of times and every time I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't. It is too fiddly for what it is (a quick tactical head-to-head affair) and requires quite a lot of book-keeping, has all kinds of counters which you add on each of your units, and its fiddliness increases when you start using artillery and vehicles.

RATING: 7
I hear this referred to as a poor man's [thing=586][/thing], but since I have never played Up Front, I have a different take on it.

It is light, but it has a lot of strategy, such as maneuvering for terrain and position advantage, managing cards, supplies, and ammunition, and juggling your command decisions.  It does all of this in a simple package and it plays quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A bit of an abstracted squad level system but it does a good job of providing the level of detail that people usually like in this scale of game while at the same time providing for quick playing time. I think that there might be a small problem with the damage system used in the game. It seems that once men start losing moral it is a quick downward spiral from that point. Sections with moral and pin hits on the are very limited in what they can do so once a section gets into trouble it's hard to get out if your opponent keeps hammering. But overall this is a pretty good squad level game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game winner is determined by whoever plays first. Attack seems to be the best and only option in the game. Advancing usually will result with getting hits and need to prepare in the next turn. The section become sitting ducks. Because of this, game usually results in landslide win.

I have only played it solitaire and I really want to play it with more people. I am about to blaspheme, but I know the game is heavily inspired by Up Front, but I still prefer this game. There just seems to be more variety. Granted I do need to play it with other people a few times.

This is my first review - caused by this awful box of  . . .
DVG, dare you publish this piece of detritus but backburner DIF Locked-On!?!?!  

Sorry Frontline fans but you must have gaping holes in your gaming schedule to be distracted by games like this. 

It must be that ANYTHING passing as a solo wargame with a WWII backdrop will gain praise.  

While playing my first 2-player game of this little gem, I was constantly referring to the non-intuitive and badly jumbled rules.  I was quickly amazed by the brutality of the punishment the disadvantaged player (who is randomly determined at the onset) must endure.  

I think it was to ease the pain inflicted by the overall experience that DVG resorted to comic-book-quality imagery on the cards.  I found it more easy to take my mauling with a grain of salt while viewing the artwork.

Later, while licking my wounds inflicted by lady luck, I downloaded cheat-sheets and condensed versions of DVG's nonsensical rules.  This was an attempt to allow myself some time in-game as opposed to in-rulebook.  

So . . .  giving it another try . . . terrain= never mind.  Range = never mind.  TACTICS = NEVER MIND.

So, I challenge Dan and any other people reading. . .  have any of you experienced WAR gamers tried the following:  Grab a handful of troop figures, a few pieces of terrain, a couple of dice, and any free rules set available for download, and let her rip!

Down in Flames Locked On . . . hey Dan, gonna sit on that one huh?  Not enough funding from Warfighter and the Leader games to take a chance on catering to the JET-AGE fan-base (whose undivided attention you already have from publishing DiF WWII).  In the meantime, you publish fibrous material suitable only for purposes of insulating doghouses (e.g. Frontline)?

As a solitaire game it is a fun yet mildly frustrating puzzle. Fire seems a bit too deadly; if you are able to get a strong attack against your opponent when he is without any ability to resist, his death is inevitable. I'm going to try ignoring all morale hits and see how that plays...I'd like the poor guys to always have some hope for survival even in the direst of circumstances.

Very nice card game about WW2. The game runs smoothly, a small match is fast enough but you can recreate big battles with many sections and vehicles.

The downsides so far:
- solo player is really unbalanced, the AI is too strong and nearly unbeatable in small engagements. You can find more details on this searching my posts in the forums. I'm a big fan of solo games but this one doesn't work so well solo, it's frustrating and it seems not well playtested to me. 
- it lacks historical accuracy. The art on the cards is cartoonish and it depicts wrong uniforms and equipment for the period.

Light for a tactical wargame, but still with considerable meat. A certain amount of chaos, as with it's conceptual ancestor Up Front, but some great ideas and mechanisms. The rulebook is a hot mess, and it will be difficult to figure out exactly how the game flows without considerable study or someone else describing it to you, the only thing preventing it from being a 9. Otherwise, well worth your time if you want a more streamlined Up Front, and with solitaire and campaign variants included in the box!

RATING: N/A
(Comments based on 1 solo play of the intro scenario.) This game is very lightweight but not entirely without interesting decisions to make. I think the trick is to get through that first 2-hour learning game, 'cause once you can get through a scenario in under an hour it becomes a worthwhile pastime. The solitaire cards work well but can get kinda crazy (I was very happy when the opposing mortar crew decided to advance adjacent to my lead section, but not so happy when it magically healed a wound and two morale hits). They're a pretty clever system IMO.

I inadvertently played it Down in Flames style, AKA to the death instead of to half VP. But with the solitaire cards as they are, even when the AI was down to its last guy I didn't feel like the (to-the-death) game was in the bag. A human opponent would probably have been a different story.

Will rate and comment further after trying some regular scenarios.

Tentative rating, possibly will rise.

A much cleaner iteration of Up Front. In most respects it much improved: damage, firing, range, and maneuver are all mercifully simple. 

Sadly the hand-management factor is one thing that made the original game cerebral and edgy. This game has reduced that in favor of brevity. I hope to play more soon to see what the game has to offer, and whether the game is overly deadly.

Don't like the combat system or the card-play mechanics.

The mechanics emphasize overwhelming firepower, gaming the act/react system to best advantage, and dropping bombs in the form of certain overpowered cards.

I never felt like I was making tactical decisions based on the battlefield but rather all decisions are predicated on gaming the card mechanics and getting your deathstar to fire before your opponent gets his to fire.

Nice components, some fresh ideas (as is typical for DV's games - he is one of the most creative wargame designers in the industry IMO), but in this game they just didn't work for me.

This doesn't seem to be a bad game. Certainly better than I thought it would be. That said, I do think the game system is a little flawed...

The more I play this game the more flawed I think it is.

In solo mode when one outnumbers the enemy, if one follows the rules, one can prepare enough times to activate all the enemy then deliver a devastating blow to which they can do nothing.

It seems that this game is very heavily weighed toward the side with the most groups....

Good game. Makes me realize how much I like hand management in war games. One has to deal with the uncertainties of battle and make the best of poor situations. Historical scenarios aren't balanced but hey that's history, no?

Wish they would introduce expansions. I prefer Eastern Front but Pacific Theater would be ok too. 

Would like to play some more.

[i]First Impressions after playing a short (25 VP) game with random terrain setup[/i]:  I'm not sure what to make of this game just yet. Will try out the Historical Scenarios, the Solo engine and a few more games. I like the cards and the chits. The rulebook was a pleasure to read through. The art is "take it or leave it" but serves its purpose to add some color to the game.  Hand-drawn art is worlds better than computer generated mannequins. 

[i]Second looks[/i]: I'm slowly warming up to this game, having figured out how to fill up one's hand with the "Prepare Action" :*)

[i]Third looks[/i]: Played a long, brutal but fun game using the Solitaire Deck. Pretty decent AI. The random terrain had scattered forests in the key locations resulting in a lengthy game. I lost against the AI. The Enemy AI is like the terminator it heals pretty fast and is relentless. Much fun was had.

I own Up Front and thought that this could be a modern replacement for it and might be simpler and more likely to get played. It is good. It is not Up Front. I like the system and it does play quite well but like others here I feel with all the markers and stuff that it can seem a bit fiddly to play and that for the amount of time taken to play a scenario there are better games out there. This is a shame as I really like the idea of it. In a way I think it is better to play this one solitaire although the rules for that have their own problems/issues.

A highly abstracted wargame, set genuinely at squad level, a point worth bearing in mind if you're coming from a Conflict of Heroes/Tide of Iron background. The rule book isn't the best I've ever seen, it's poorly organised and the wording leaves a few things to interpretation, but the game flows smoothly enough. Squad-level tactics are pretty simple things: when to move, when to stay put, how much firepower to lay down, you really are playing the part of a lieutenant or sergeant here and their job isn't the most glamourous in the army. The historical scenarios are the way to play, random games are less successful (I can't think why you wouldn't want a sniper, for instance, but then that's also what I'd want on a real battlefield) and the solitaire rules are just hopeless. This is still day and night better than the superficially similar Pocket Battles, but I need to play more to see how immersive this really is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid game, but not quite what I was expecting. With a scale so small, I was hoping for a little more of a... well... story here. Still, the game is really good, even though it has a truly awful rulebook (nice to look at, terrible to learn/reference) and historical scenarios that seem to have nothing to do with history. The short play time and interesting mechanics do redeem it, though.

This is an OK game.  It is pretty simple, it plays fast, and I like the equipment mechanism and the way relative range is handled.  Ultimately however, I won't be keeping it.  When I play it, I find I would rather be playing Up Front.  A comparison to Up Front comes naturally, and the games are close enough such comparison is not unfair.  

Don't assume I'm just an Up Front fan boy. I would dearly love to find a better game than Up Front that scratches the same itch. I bought Frontline D-Day hoping that it would be "the one" to do that.  It didn't.

Once you get past the admittedly steep learning curve for Up Front, it is simply a better game than Frontline.  It is deeper, more exciting, and hand management and advanced planning are more important.  You can do more interesting things with your troops in Up Front, although obviously at the cost of additional rules weight.  Frontline D-Day is fun...Up Front is just more fun.

Solitaire possible.  

I'd rate the solitaire game a 7, 
but the 2-player game is very disappointing and pretty badly flawed, with a cycle of one side gaining the attack advantage and then keeping it.  Also, the rules for defining held terrain are unclear, and haven't yet been clarified.  The only reason I rated as high as a 4 is that the solo game is okay.

Interesting tactical combat card game with a slimmer rule set than its obvious inspiration, Up Front.  My only play so far was less a game of tactical manuever than of wait for strong cards, hold and shoot with overwhelming firepower.  Early attempts to move forward were jeopardized by vicious attacks by the responding player.  Subsequent turns saw neither player risking an advance.  Not exactly what I had in mind but we selected our 20 VP teams and both chose units with decent firepower so that might not be as big a problem with the historical scenarios -- further play might cause me to revise the rating.

RATING: 8
They compare this to the classic Up Front!  Though I'm not of pure card wargame, this game's graphics are superb and I know the artist.  Plus, it can always be played alone which is a rare design feature that I am looking for and wondering about for a long time. What's more value-added is that there is a random mission generator that sets the game up quickly and off you go, yankee!

The game is brutal and aptly put the players into the frontline of D-Day campaign!  I played a solitaire game with random pick of the "soldier" cards.  The firepower of the Allied infantry gun and unarmored vehicle are awesome!  Despite the better trained German soldiers, they are paralyzed in front of these weapons.  Unless the Germans can get up close and personal with the enemies, I don't see how I can win a solitaire game.  The AI is methodical in this game!  My German forward Mahler (Mortar) was buried under the scattered trees once he moved out.  The rest of the Germans were stuck in the burned-out buildings.  The AI infantry gun stay put in the back while keep firing at my Germans, while he moved out the unarmored vehicle to open ground to kill Leutinant Eisenberg, Unteroffizier Rothstein and Grenadier Brauer.  What a game.

The AI is one of the most brutal I have found.  Many times I found my men shot down by their heavy firepower with bonus on the solitaire tactics cards before I could get a chance to move my men closing in.  One interesting point of the solitaire game here is that don't try to be too aggressive to the AI but to keep clam and stay low in the place, while looking for opportunity of the AI to "mis-fire" against a "wrong" target.  For example, when the solitaire card chose the furthest target in your section, say an infantry gun, instead of the closest infantry section, you should not counterattack with the infantry gun but to do so with the closer infantry section that had already been closing in to a short distance.  And don't be shy to use rapid fire in an counterattack even though the firepower is halved in that case.  So remember to take the chance to default counterattack!  

I like the game.  It plays fast and competitive. It puts you into the blistering field of combat "up-front". It is a flexible system but the rulebook is not something that is coherent enough to make a whole (especially when it is applied to the solitaire system, where I think the designer hasn't thought of every conceivable situations in the rules e.g should the AI draw a card every time I prepare a section?  Should the AI act again when the solitaire card told me not to flip the opposing section into "Acted"?  Should the opposing section draw another card while advancing into an open ground, which says the section draw 1 action card?  If the next solitaire card says to attack, does the section get to attack even though they had acted? What if the first solitaire card says the section does not flip to the acted counter side and can act again? In this situation, does the section get to attack?  There are so many questions to meddle with some time and common sense has to be used in many cases.  

I find I have to check often the rules with flipping over the scenarios in the middle.  There are quite a number of rules missing out in details in my view.  However, once you get past through all these, the game really delivers!  Also, DVG game is using some fragrant materials.  My components keep smelling good at all time while I play!

Amazing card game that manages to offer a deep tactical experience while still feeling like a card game. It abstracts the battlefield in a very clever way which makes the game fast paced while keeping all the theme and tension of the subject.

3 / 5 - Good.

I'm initially pretty impressed with this. It seems to be a flavourful game with a ton of flexibility and excitement and, when explored, reveals quite a bit of hidden depth. Cunning moves on the part of the opposition can really leave you head-scratching to make best use of your resources. But it's overshadowed by a major grumble: the game seems prone to trapping one player in an un-winnable situation in a significant minority of plays, either through first-turn advantage or overwhelming firepower.

I want to like the game more than I do.  The first player  has a distinct advantages.  The rules need to be organized better. It does not help that the 1st listed historical scenario: Pegasus bridge is unbalanced and unsuitable for beginners.  It make a poor early experience in the game.

I enjoy card driven war games.  Up Front is still my favorite, but I like this one better than Memoir '44 and love Memoir '44!

It does lack a LOS feature and that weakens it just a bit in my opinion.  Still a fun play.

Underwhelmed after three plays (two introductory games and Scenario #10, all ftf). Rule book looks nice but is often less than helpful. Seems to be a lot of confusion regarding solitaire play. [3 plays; sold for a loss in Apr 2014]

RATING: 5
simple setup, nice mechanic, but too bad no "Misses" mechanic, every single shot can be a painful hit. And it seems drawing chit is boring, I still prefer dice rolling to resolve combat. Solo play is technically unbalanced and it's almost impossible to win. I lost interest after 3-4 games and probably will get back to it later

RATING: 4
Uses a chit draw combat system, quite  like DG's famous formations. 

The solo system, cheats, and is therefore worthless IMO, much better to just play both sides. (By cheat I mean that the opponent gets to do more in its move than is possible using the normal rules.)

RATING: 7
After one play (solitaire), I'm interested in what the game has to offer.  The solitaire system seems pretty decent, if not a little unfair at first glance (though that's often expected with an AI solitaire deck).  Sometimes it counter-attacks with overwhelming force, and other times it just does nothing (I had a lucky early turn where I could decimate a section because it was the only one of the board and had already acted).

I have now played two games, both solo.  I like Phantom Leader a lot more.  In fact, this is the weakest of the solitaire games I have played over the last few weeks (The Kaiser's Pirates, D-Day Omaha Beach, and RAF).  All of the uniform and equipment inaccuracies bug me . . . wrong picture of the German 50mm mortar, having German soldiers in the 1940 uniform in 1944, MG34 vs MG42 in 1944, US canteens for the Germans, etc.  I know that it is a light wargame, but it made it more difficult to get into the feel of the period.  I may be unfairly comparing it to UP FRONT.  I hope I will like it more when I play it face-to-face.

Yet another game I purchased based on the reviews here at BGG.  Thanks to everyone for your comments/reviews.

I have decided all future game purchases must have solitaire rules built in.  This game has an A.I. built in, and it truly acts like an A.I.  As people have noted, it reloads quickly, almost viciously at times.  However, imo, it does have weaknesses that can be exploited.  It is also subject to the vagaries of luck. War can be that way sometimes.

One of the first games that caught my attention on BGG was Up Front.  It fascinated me as I became more immersed in the Euro market.  Cost and complexity deterred me.  Then Fields of Fire appeared.  I almost jumped on it, actually putting in my Wishlist twice and my Cart once.  Each time I reread the reviews on BGG and backed off.

Somehow I found out about Frontline D-Day.  And I'm glad I did.  For me this game is the right balance of depth and ease of play for squad level type action.  The mechanics for handling the nuances of terrain, weaponry, skill, vulnerability have been abstracted just enough to make it playable while keeping the flavor.

The A.I. really feels like a real player, and an excellent one at that.  Much of the time, its' strategy works, so I have a hard time faulting it.  

I am currently working my way through the scenarios as the Allies and look forward to setting up some custom battles at some time.

I am also thinking of adding line-of-sight rules to make the terrain a little more realistic.  After I complete the scenarios!

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time
+ ALMOST want to play it all the time
+ Finest solitaire opponent I've found yet

RATING: 3
Really want to like it, but on a first play it fell flat.  
Battlelines: The Stalingrad Campaign accomplishes what this game seems to want to accomplish, except Battlelines does it on a non-linear playing area. 

The rulebook is also badly written, repeating itself several times but missing some key information.   

I'll give this another chance though, but I'm concerned about this game sticking around in my collection too much longer.

EDIT: Ugh, played a game with armoured vehicles added in, and the game suffered dramatically for it.  No need to advance when armour can pick each other off at will.  Additionally the player with the first turn to fire is at a massive advantage, and I'll wager that if someone was outnumbered by AT-capable force (even just 3 to 2), they would hold a massive advantage. 

One of the biggest disappointments in recent memory.

Supposedly "Up Front" is the better game, and is due a reprint some time 2013/2014 (but there are issues with Kickstarter project?)

RATING: 4
We played two games, one with two sections each and the second game I had three sections and my opponent had four.  In both games I managed to get in the first shots.  My opponent would prepare to get unpinned.  I would prepare and pick up more cards.  I would then hammer him again and the cycle would repeat.  In both games he was in an unrecoverable death spiral.  I was afraid to move or I would give my opponent the opportunity to fire and put me into the death spiral.  I hope we were missing a rule or a strategy.  Otherwise this game is just not very good.  Having to counterattack constantly to defend yourself also did not feel right.  I thought that the damage chits could have used some misses.  I also did not care for the artwork,  I would have preferred some good photos.  I absolutely love Up Front that this is compared to and was hoping this would be a light version of that, but it just did not measure up.

The art is spot-on on some cards (vehicles, terrains), but real lame in others (soldiers, orders), which, for me, is a big no-no for a cardgame. Besides that, the game is too bland for my tastes, without enough tactical choices available for the players and with an unimpressive combat resolution system. A so-so game that takes advantage on being one of the few (if not the sole) WWII squad-level card games currently available.

Not without clever ideas, but the game is just not interesting.

The combat is FAR too bloody.  Large firebases can overwhelm and whoever gets the first effective shot in is highly likely to win.  Even on a moderate fire attacks (final FP 10 or so) , once you start drawing damage chits, almost everyone in a group is going to take a hit  (And if they don't, it is because the first guy dies).  If a larger attack happens, the section is toast.

Pins (even though they are the cheapest and most common result) are more deadly than Morale hits:  I can't do anything with the pinned man until I prepare him.  If several men need to unpin, forcing me to prepare the section, the opponent can  respond by reloading his firebase for another monster shot.

Often the most effective of way defending against a large attack is counter-attack, but that takes a precious action.  Often when you defending you have a choice between do a rapid fire counterattack (which takes take to recover from) just so the section survive now vs. having them be mauled and permanently lost.

The tactics don't feel like squad level combat

No--not the successor to Up Front.

I think the game works pretty well.  It's bloody.  One has to manage their card supply well and make sure they have the ability to respond when necessary.  It's a decent, fairly quick game playable in not much more (or less) than an hour in most circumstances.

--Jun2010-- Fascinating low-level combat game.  Vaguely reminiscent of a streamlined _Up Front_ with a few additional modern touches thrown in for fun.

The basic concept is very much the same as Up Front, but Frontline has added some excellent new ideas and/or tweaked the old formula.

1) Fixed terrain. Instead of terrain being something that you draw randomly, you are maneuvering back and forth across a set battlefield. While there is definitely something to be said for the way unexpected terrain would come up in UF, Frontline's approach is really superior. You can leave terrain and then retreat back into it as necessary, and you have a good feel for what your terrain objectives should be. Thankfully, there are no line of sight rules to clutter things up.

2) There is no lateral relationship between sections. In UF, you are very concerned with how your sections are set up so you can use flanking movement. Flanking movement in Frontline is abstracted into the cards and is more of a vertical issue (the further you advance, the higher your flanking bonus, so you can get behind enemy units and really tear them up if you so choose).

3) Nationality and doctrine are handled differently. In UF, each nationality has different hand sizes and discard capacities, which added a lot of flavor. In Frontline, the differences in nationalities comes with the individual soldier ratings and the equipment options. Honestly, UF is more fun in this regard, though not necessarily more realistic.

4) There is a greater variety of outcomes to fire. In addition to being pinned or killed, you can suffer morale hits or wounds. This is integrated very cleverly into terrain effects, so you will take more damage in light cover than in heavy cover. Smart, elegant, simple mechanism.

5) Firefights have more of a simultaneous feel in Frontline due to the Counterattack rules. Instead of having an IGO-UGO style firefight where you drop a fire card in your turn, then your opponent plays a fire card in their turn, you get immediate fire and counterfire. It's a clever system. That said, there ends up being a different feel to fire and movement. In UF, it felt very organic to utilize fire and movement concepts--you have your firebase lay down fire with a fire card while your maneuver group advances to cover, then you switch it up. Frontline feels a bit more like an impulse game along the Storm of Arnhem lines, as you have to carefully order your actions to strip enemy sections of their capacity, then engage in a firefight that effectively covers a sections movement. You'll see when you set the game up how different the feel is in this regard.

6) You don't spend as much time waiting for cards in Frontline because you can always play a default move, attack or counterattack. I'd forgotten how much time you could spend doing nothing in UF until I started playing some Vassal games recently, but suffice to say, there can be some significant lulls in combat. Frontline is a quicker, deadlier game, where it's hard to go more than a few turns without taking serious damage.

7) Frontline is radically more streamlined. Instead of convoluted rules for weapons exchange or infiltration and close combat, Frontline handles everything with extreme simplicity (this is a good thing). As a result, it's painless to play with mortars, painless to play with vehicles, basically just painless to play.

Update--I still like a lot of things in the design, but the niggles have weighed it down some in my estimation.  Firepower is too deadly, there are generally too few units involved in the historical scenarios (which exacerbates the firepower issue), and often the first player to take damage will be unable to recover.  There are also a few mechanical issues, like an overreliance on chits (drawing twice for every combat resolution strikes me as particularly cumbersome).  

**Update**
Bumped my rating back up half a point.  I think the game may play better solo than with two.

After several plays, I can be very short on this one:
1. very fun and nice to play 2player, 3player or 4player: many choices (during preparations and during operations), a portion of luck (card draw), but enough space to make plans and try to execute them.

2. not half as fun playing this solo. solo play is OK to try some tactics and if you really don't have an opponent available, but on the other hand there are far better (more interesting) games to play solo than FLDD!
If you are looking at this game mainly for solo play, I cannot recommend it to you!

This is what I expected, both in terms of its shortcomings and its pro's.  
It's not nearly the table-hog I had heard.  For a card game, its quite manageable.
There's bookkeeping but as long as you follow the turn instructions (flipping counters) it's really a non-issue.
At this point I have no idea about strategy but I suspect that when I begin to use the solo deck something will make itself known to me.
To me, the game screams for a variant. I'm all too happy to try and discover one.

The other reviewers' comments appear to be extraordinarily tolerant and generous.  

My initial response, based on one game (after an admittedly terrible rules explanation):  Basic in the extreme, with not much decision-making.  While I was expecting a light game, I wasn't expecting "Kaiser's Pirates" light.

And yes, you should be worried whether people are wondering - for the simpler scenarios, at least - whether going first is a huge advantage.

To agree with one reviewer: If your opponent attacks with any reasonable amount of firepower, and you have no way to respond, your attacked group is just dead.  

(Rating withheld until I'm sure that I played by the proper rules.)

Not sure about scenarios... and ya know I am so bummed about this one. I was so hoping for an Up Front contender but it has not become that for me. Something just doesn't seem right about the game. It seems a bit to 'fast' - I would like a bit more room and time to make tactical choices and manouver. But you never really seem to be able to do that... I do like the chit system and other aspects of the game. This is a game I SHOULD love but I just don't yet. I will have to give it a bunch more plays and hope for an upgrade in opinion. I refuse to give up on it.

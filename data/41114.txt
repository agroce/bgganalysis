Made a homemade version of this using Star Wars CCG cards. It's at least 1.5x awesomer than regular The Resistance and at least 150x awesomer than Star Wars CCG.

It needs 5 players in the least. That's real hard to get in these here parts, so I prefer Deception Murder in Hong Kong to it cuz its easier to get 4 people than 5. But if you can get it and play it, do it, its fun.

RATING: 9.5
Probably my favourite deception game of all time. I grew up playing Mafia/Werewolf, and when I discovered this, it was love at first sight. 

I always dislike the way mafia tends to boil down into the detective just telling all of the players what to do, and The Resistance largely removes that omniscient character. The deduction is there and information is plentiful, but also easy to falsify.

I can't say enough good things about this game!!

One of the best gaming experiences I have had was playing The Resistance with a group of eight, half of whom I knew well and the other half I had just met. 
The game was intense and humorous at the same time. The tension was thick but it was so funny to watch people I know (who are terrible liars) try to deceive me and each other. 
Everyone had a blast that night with this game.
I have since tried it on my family during my birthday and it was not as well received.
Thankfully I have the positive experience to go on as well or I wouldn't know what this game can do.

Much improved version of the old classic Werewolf. Accusations can actually be based on voting records. Hard for the Resistance to win, but not impossible. Played with groups from 5-10. Seems to work well, with any sized group.

The first night I played it my group seemed a little apprehensive and didn't think they'd like it. We then proceeded to play it another six times back to back. It was the first game requested at the following games night and it completely dominated the playlist. It has been requested every single game night since then.
After each game people were enthusiastically discussing strategy and running down play-by-play analysis of each and every decision made and really thinking about how and why things worked the way they did.

Clearly it's doing something right.

A very simple game of bluffing and trying to guess the traitor. It's quick to play, and has that "let's go again" factor. A good game, but the theme is a little dry for my taste. There is no reason to play this over the newer Avalon version.

Update: With dozens of plays the experience changes - it's like tennis where there's a set of expectations against another veteran player but it's a different game to compensate for a new player's wild swings.

Our first several games of this with seven players went very well!  It condenses the whole BSG experience into a short, tight little game with plenty of argument and accusation.  It doesn't feel as high-stakes as BSG does simply because of the lesser time investment, but I think it absolutely has a place on our shelf.

Loved my first couple of plays of this - family vacation with my adult siblings and parents, and we had a lot of fun. Can't wait to try with my gaming group, think we'll be yelling at each other very soon!

Played it with my group, and while the first game was a little slow, by the end, we were all into it. Played several more rounds, and good fun was had by all. Lots of finger pointing and laughing!

5-25-13 The only problem I have with this game, and what keeps it from being a 10 (and I might even have to knock it down from it's 9.5) is that we can't seem to win as the Rebels. We enjoy pointing fingers at each other, but it's starting to get old in a way.

I bought this as my first modern board game, with the idea of playing it with my friends in school between classes. We also invite some other classmates to play if they have some free time.

Everyone has loved it! The idea of getting as much information as you can when you are a resistance member, or doing your best at lying when you are a spy is amazing. The best part is that, as you can't decide your alliance nor be sure of the others' one, it's extremely rare for two plays to be the same.

The only problem is that spies win too often, especially if the players are good liars. But even if the game is kind of unbalanced it is always fun to play it, just to see your friends shouting and distrusting everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I don't usually enjoy social deduction games, but this is for sure the best one I've played so far. My biggest complaint about this kind of game is the usual absence of a solid mechanic beneath all the talking, lying and bluffing... which makes the game-play too intangible - so to speak - for me, since the players can only rely on their ability to read other people's faces.

The Resistance is different, even if it's still really simple and straight-forward. The key to its trick is the addition of the voting phase, because it really allows to read the other players's intentions and brings a huge deal of discussion to the table every time. This simple mechanic makes the game very deep and interesting! I also like the fact that all the players are involved at all times... unlike Werewolf, a game which is often compared to Resistance, where players are killed off turn by turn.

The Resistance is a really great game... and one I'm growing more fond of play after play. The Avalon version introduces some really cool roles, that make thing even more interesting and even more tense! Finally I've found the social deduction game that I enjoy. Huge thumbs up for me!

Wow, just wow. This is one of the greatest party games that I've been introduced to. All of the suspicion, accusation, finger-pointing and treachery of a game like BSG or SOC, but all turns are taken together and everyone is involves in every play. After learning the rules, my friends and I were completing a game in 20 mins and coming back for more.

The only markdown is on balance.  In standard rules, the spys win very regularly. Even with a slight imbalance, it was a blast seeing how each game would play out. If you're interested in a more balanced game I'd recommend playing the 'blind spy' variant. 

EDIT:
I retract my imbalance comment towards spies. Turns out we were just doing it wrong. Remember people, vote teams down!

Non-existent theme and ugly art hide what is not that bad a game. The themelessness prevented me from really getting into The Resistance, and perhaps the lack of theme also made the game not at all tense for me. I suspect that the generally high ratings given to this game are on the basis of it being a party game. Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of party games, and The Resistance is no exception.

From first group of plays it seems impossible to determine who the spies were in a group of 6.  Don't think we were table talking enough, but we are all good liers so I don't think that would matter that much.  Think we were playing more as a game than a social experience that it is really meant to be.  Hopefully I can get it back to the table again to try again.

Smooth game of hidden roles and lying to your friends.  It's essentially mafia/werewolf without the moderator.  It handles large groups well, and I don't think I'd play below 7.  The tokens are annoying but worth it to get rid of the moderator/app voice.  I really appreciate that there's no stupid special roles.

Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The secret traitor mechanic is implemented intuitively and can be fun as long as you get into the game--make sure to accuse people and get the ball rolling! However, I really don't prefer the standard rules where spies know one another (standard rules as written). I've played many games where the spies didn't know one another... and they still won most of the time. The 'blind spies' variant in the rulebook makes the dynamics so much more fun IMO.

RATING: 10
Pros
- Lying to someone else's face
- Not lying to someone's face and they think you are 
- Trying to figure out who's lying to your face
- Knowing someone is a spy, but nobody will believe you even though you know they are
- Trying to figure out if you or your spy teammate is going to fail this mission
- Knowing that your team already lost because you weren't on the last mission
- Seeing someone's loyalty card and knowing they are on your team
- Seeing someone's card and lying to everybody that they are a spy
- Components and cards are great 

Cons
- Drunk people are difficult to teach this game to, I've learned 
- Someone who is shy or timid might get lost in the shuffle in larger games by outspoken people 
- Might have to sleeve loyalty cards to avoid marks

It's a great party game!  The hype is true.  I probably like this game more than werewolf (because no one will die and do nothing).  It's simple to explain and to play, but yet can be deep to deduce which one is the bad guys.  Very good party game.

One issue is that before playing the game, the group must all agree that this game is about lying and bluffing.  In our game we had an issue where a lady were not happy when her bf lied to her in the game :(

This would probably be my favorite social deduction game, except that the math of the situation seems too limiting. The low numbers of participants in each mission really narrows the deduction down on the right people and, due to that, the game is constrained to a pretty short ride. That prevents it from being like Spyfall, and allowing people to just keep on playing it over and over.

I'd prefer something that does a better job of evoking the theme of going on missions, as resistance fighters, and which gave a strong feeling of an extended campaign to root out the traitors and also fight the good fight. As it is, it feels too tightly constrained to do exactly one thing, for five minutes, and then you're done with it.

Fun party game ish, though can fall flat with the wrong group or if players aren't paying attention.  While not a bad game, somewhat hit-or-miss.

I've never really had a great game of it, and have had several bad ones.  I'd much rather play ONUWW in basically any situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The Resistance is one of those games that with the right group of people it is a blast but in another group it might not work as well. I've played games with both and the experience has been very different but thankfully I have played more "good" games of The Resistance than "bad" ones. 

I really like the way that the game isn't really a puzzle that you can solve. Sure there are strategies for the spies and the rebels to help their side win but ultimately a lot of it comes down to how the individual player reacts.

A great party game that has theme, interaction and short-play time going for it! Much better than Werewolf!

Edit: My love for "The Resistance" has waned somewhat over time but that could just be a result of the group I play it with. I find it can be too shouty and too prone to "groupthink" with no actual evidence to back up accusations. It also kind of sucks if you get dealt the same role again and again. This is just the bad luck of the draw but it can still get stale quickly if this happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I cannot believe how successful this game is when I bring it out with non-gamers. I always worry the theme will turn people off or that it's too complex, but in the end the damn game really only has two cards and people seem to get it. Great party, bar, or filler game.

This is, hands down, my favorite game. I don't really enjoy the plot cards from one of the expansions, but the vanilla game is just that great.

As any social game, is very important the group of people, but it's usually a sucess for me.

Not recommended at all if you or any other player heavily dislike lying in games, as they probably won't have fun playing it.

5-10(7)

UPDATE: The Avalon roles do way way more to keep this game lively than the plot cards ever did. Highly recommended.

-------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: A lot more interesting with the plot cards, on account of it's not merely just an interesting smoke-and-mirrors "he said she said" game, but rather something where information gets introduced into the game. I think it also improves the balance. A great social activity.

---------------------------------------------------------

Played with five, which worked really well.

For what it is, this is excellent. We played this over and over. An effective traitor game where you have multiple means of gathering information: mission failure, team selection, and voting for the teams. Spies will often vote in bloc, and often conspicuously, say.

At points, the first rounds feel "throwaway" in that spies are too anxious to sabotage, and are sort of waiting for later rounds (in which the rebels have to choose their teams perfectly). But then, there is still team selection and voting (even if the missions pass). Given that spies know who each other are, their behavior can be noticeably different (and susceptible to groupthink).

Certain weaknesses are that it can depend a lot of the social elements and the dissembling, which may make it unenjoyable or difficult for some players. Also, some games can be right routs if the spies tip too early (though it's their fault!) or if the rebels just happen to stumble into winning teams. But with quick gameplay, I can't say that it ruins the experience at all.

Party Deduction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've been playing this every weekend for more than 5 months and I still find new deception tactics in every game. Some people say it's best for 5, 7, 9. My personal fav is 6 or 9. With its simple mechanics, it has incredible deduction/accusation logic under the hood. Each setup requires its own approach and modelling of all possible situations in advance. If you're a spy, you've got to plan your offensive and chaos-making strategies. If you're a good guy, you've got to predict spy behaviors, plan the tactics of keeping the group with a cold head. Either require strong emotional readiness for defensive situations.

P.S. Hidden Agenda (Avalon roles) are highly recommended.

Not every group intuitively understands the 'mechanics'. On the occasions when you have the right group, perhaps 1 out of 4 games turns out in a way wherein the victor made some legitimate deductions or earned genuine insight. On THOSE occasions the game is really fun. When you're the spy, it's always very tense.
When properly run i'd go as high as an '8'...but on average the experience yields a 7.5

The problem is, it's a very group dependent game. As there are not too much tactical choices, the main part of the game is its social aspect - not fitting for everyone.

I can't tell you how much I hate Mafia and Werewolf.  That said, The Resistance is a pretty awesome game! It adds a layer of complexity by selecting mission members and allows you to ferret out the spies.

The "Plot Thickens" cards add more variation/information into the game beyond the standard logic/deduction.

Another major plus: NO PLAYER ELIMINATION.

Edit: Downgraded as too many of the games just result in shouting matches and it devolved back into Werewolf/Mafia style play.

I have been playing werewolf/mafia/assassin over the past few months whenever I could get a large group together and always enjoyed these games as the moderator. But then I discovered "The Resistance" which took the experience to a new level... and I now get to play as well. Brilliant game (with the right players), as long as you don't take the accusations personally.

Love a deduction werewolf style game that doesn't include player elimination. While the Plot Thickens cards give additional layers of information that help the Resistance members, the game loses some elegance with them in play.

The game is great with the right crowd; however, I've found it difficult to find the right crowd. Play it with non-gamers and they don't really get it and vote randomly; play it with hard-core gamers and it drags out for a long time as people continuously talk and reason their way through everything.

So, I kinda liked it.  I've long since grown tired of Werewolf, and appreciate what many others seem to appreciate about Resistance relative to it: quick play, no elimination.  And I've played exactly once, but it seems pretty darn hard for the good guys to win this one.  Not my cup of tea, but I'm happy to entertain it for now and would definitely suggest it over Werewolf on length alone.

*First edition copy*
I just got a chance to play it a few times. Great game. It could be better with the right folks though. One friend thought it was best to accuse me of being the spy all the time.  We also had an issue with a member of the resistance choosing a mission fail card. My only beef with the game was that the minimal symbolism on the cards isn't completely clear. Yes, no, pass, fail would have been cool on the card. Maybe this is blasphemy, but I just used a sharpie and wrote the words on the cards. The second edition deals with this by having those words on the card.  Otherwise, excellent part quality. I

 The plot thickens cards appear to shift a game from social deduction to logical deduction and tip the scales in the rebels favor. Without the plot cards, the game tends to lean towards the spies. I prefer the game without the plot cards. YMMV.

RATING: 7
Definitely a game with a lot of strategy and skill, though the spies seem to have a bit of an advantage. The quickness of the game is also a plus, at least to get other players to play. The downside of the game is that sometimes it has a nasty feel to it (because you are either constantly lying or being lied to), making it harder to enjoy the experience.

RATING: 6.5
When looking for games that play large numbers AND that play fast AND won't eliminate the players before the game is over, the options are rather limited.  This game solves that problem in spades.  Play is fast - perhaps even too fast - and no players will be eliminated from the game play until the very end.  Like its predecessor Werewolf, game play is dependent on the group dynamics.  Mechanically, the game works fine with pure strangers, but its potential emerges with group and player interaction history.  Suspicion, doubts, and double-crosses will drive the game to include the interaction and good confrontation it is suppose to have.  Without the banter, the game will play out and feel a bit like a group random outcome.  When personality comes in to play, the outcome is more questioned - for the benefit of all players.  This is a solid game that is well suited to filling a large group's attention for 30 minutes, but will likely need several plays by a group to really start to shine.

RATING: 9
A lot of hidden role games are complicated by having many roles each with their own special ability to keep track of. This makes it tough to bring these games out at a party where there are a lot of new players who can't pick up on the subtle interactions between different roles on their first playthrough.

The Resistance is essentially a minimal working model of the "hidden role" mechanism, so that everyone's able to participate effectively immediately after learning the rules.

Such a tight game of deception and deduction, even if you just play the base rules and add nothing else. Kind of brilliant if you can pull together 5+ people to give it a go, especially how it places almost all the actual meat of the 'gameplay' on the participants and not the rules.

3/30/2011: Fun but it seems to be extremely difficult for the resistance to win.  Either we need to get significantly better at this, or the game needs to be tweaked.  On the other hand I consider this a filler, so maybe that isn't the end of the world.

It's nice that it's better with more players, easy to explain and quick.

RATING: 6.33
A fun little social deduction game. The deception is a lot of fun and trying to figure out who is lying to your face can be very entertaining. I strongly prefer the basic version without the cards. For me, the cards extend the game to the point that it overstays its welcome.

2011-10 Largely dependant on social interaction. Who is good? Who is bad? Who can make them self seem good when they're actually bad.
I expect it feels like Werewolf but plays quicker without elimination, which is why I was willing to play even after avoid WereWolf for years.

2012-05 After playing this I decided to join WereWolf when given the chance. They do feel similar but The Resistance is probably going to be a lot quicker and more engaging on the whole as there isn't player elimination. They are different niches though.

Cool for what it is, but much thinner than I thought it would be.  It is very straight pure refinement of the genre, and quick, but at $20 for a deck, I think I'd just take the rules, some bits, and play it for free.

For what it is, it is well done.  In the full spectrum of games, and what I like, expensive fillers have to take a hit though.  Hence, 6.

This game is best played as written, with the Plot cards. I get kind of disgusted when told people play with blind spies, or when people reject the plot cards. When played *ahem* properly, this game is the best hidden role and deduction game ever, with its elegance and social jockeying.

The new edition sacrifices one of this game's greatest strengths, portability, while also replacing its beautiful cover art with George Patsouras' kind of uncanny valley-ish art. I find his stuff decent on cards, but a little vacant for more prominent components like the box.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Like Werewolf, but plays with fewer, doesn't need a moderator, and doesn't involve player elimination. Basically, I love it. Requires a good group to play with, though, with members needing to be both logically-minded and capable of lying convincingly. Several member of my group don't like it, so I'm guessing this one won't be played a whole lot. :/

RATING: 7
This is one of those games that I think everyone should try once. While it is a social deduction game like Werewolf, which I'm not too fond of, it does do two things very well. First, it has no player elimination and creates an engaging experience from the start to end. Secondly, it manages to appeal to all types of gamers through its innovative and deceptively meaningful voting system. For family/social gamers, there is a simple to understand game where players can accuse each other based on their intuition. But for heavier gamer, the voting system creates concrete information to make meaningful decisions. In other words, this game works with both a social mindset and a competitive mindset.

Personally speaking, I think Avalon is the better "version" of the Resistance. While it offers less content, the variants in Avalon seem to be more balanced/play-tested. Plus, the simple addition of Merlin/Assassin really adds to the experience without much complexity. That being said, I will gladly play any version of The Resistance.

RATING: 7
As many people have said, it cuts off all the fat from Battlestar Galactica, while retaining the core ideas of cooperation amongst possible betrayal, and trying the deduce the identities of the traitors (or trying to evade deduction in case of the traitors). I find it easy to get into the flow of it, unlike Battlestar. Great social game with a good bit of strategy.

A clever deduction game. Players are either part of the resistance or spies, and through mission assignments and through voting try to deduce who is who. 5 rounds, the team that wins 3 times wins the game.
This version comes with an expansion. 15 conspiracy cards are added to the game enabling more strategy and potential bluffing.
Great fun in a small box. It's more challenging to play as the resistance than it is to play as a spy, at least not using the expansion cards.
Unfortunately you need a minimum of 5 players to play this game.

The concept is excellent, but execution a little lacking. Determining who the spies are is largely a crapshoot, or a game of reading people. Voting records are not as valuable as in Werewolf, since there's only a good and bad role. No special roles with more information, like Werewolf. It's almost impossible to choose teams without a spy, unless someone screws up. Boring.

Ez a játék egy kicsit a hagyományos "gyilkosozásra" emlékeztet, de itt sokkal konkrétabb megnyilatkozások vannak, nem csak vitázgatás, és a játékmenet jól le van szabályozva (max 5 kör pl.)
Bár a szabály alapján jónak tűnt, elsőre csalódás volt:  kuszának éreztem. Szerencsére többet is játszottunk vele egymás után, a 3. parti végére már megbarátkoztunk vele. A rövid szabály ellenére meglepő kombinációs lehetőségek sejlettek fel a játékban, sok parti van benne, de jobban oda kell figyelni, mint azt elsőre gondolná az ember.
A játék felépítése nagyon egyszerű, egy pakli kártya, meg egy kis tábla. Néhány kártya nyelvfüggő. Az ígért 30 perc helyett 5-6 perc alatt lement egy menet, de lehet agyalósabban is játszani...

A decent game of bluffing and sabotage. A certain number of players (depending on the total number) have to secretly sabotage three of the five missions that make up the game to win. Players discuss and agree who should go on each mission, and the spies can choose to help or hinder the mission as they see fit, as long as they are chosen to go on it. The game is deviously simple, to the extent that it boils down to your ability to bluff and how well you know the other players, rather than the game itself.

Fun, quick, but gets less and less satisfying the more you play with the same group of people.

The Resistance is a Wherewolf variant with a better theme, that corrects the flaws of the original game: there is no player elimination, and the lenght of the game is definitely shorter.
The base game is quite straightforward, and every player has a clear objective, but there's lots of room for bluffing and deduction.
I am not the greatest fan of the genre, but this game is quite enjoyable and fun to play.

Like the fast paced game we had today. Introduced it to another play group and to me it turned out pretty well. Surprised that the loyalist managed to pull it off and get their act together.

Think 5 players brings out the best in Resistance. Just played the base game with no additional cards. Will be looking forward to another session.

I actually like this version as well, but have to give the edge to Avalon as the different characters are more fun then the plot thickens cards.

Awesome party game.  I played a lot of Mafia when I was younger usually with large groups (15-20 people).  I was usually the narrator.  This game blows Mafia out of the water.  It is the same type of fun social deduction and deception but there is actually meaningful information being exchanged and all players are involved the whole time.  The time length is perfect with the 5 missions, I will never go back to Mafia.

The Resistance is one of the first games that started the deluge of social deduction games, and to this day, it remains one of the best.

Some may argue that the game is too vanilla without the "plot twists" (no longer included in the latest edition of the game) and that it's essentially a "solved" game; however, this may only be true if you consistently play with the same group. Having played the game with 41 different people at this point, I can safely say that two of my plays have never been the same.

Some players are great at being the spies, while others can even fail before the game has begun. Therefore, some games can fail utterly with the Resistance having deduced the spies by the second round; however, with repeated plays, your group can really form memorable and comical experiences. A game that makes me laugh is a great game in my books.

I'm not a very good spy, personally. I tend to remain quite silent as a spy, while as a member of the resistance, I am fairly vocal. The fun of the game for me lies in puzzling out who the spies may be - I don't care too much about the bluffing and deceptive aspects of the game. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that cooperative deduction games are more up my alley than social deduction games.

I have also played Avalon, the Arthurian legend spin-off of the Resistance, many times as well, but I think that I prefer the vanilla gameplay of The Resistance more.

Overall, every gamer should try The Resistance at some point. It is a classic that needs to be experienced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Played this game with 5 players and the basic version and as that goes I have to say this game is broken for that.  The spies won everytime easily.  Perhaps the game would be better with more players, but as far 5 players go it is unplayable.

RATING: 8
I like both Resistance and Resistance:Avalon a lot, updated the rating as well. A game for big group that is mostly just about talking others to trust you, so basically this is a debate training experience. Having never played Werewolf I believe I like Resistance more, due to no player elimination in game. And this should be played a few rounds to get everyone warmed up, as the group does have big effect on how this works, basically the more talkative the better.

The Resistance is always a blast to play.  The game plays so quickly that I believe the meta-game of remembering how certain players played previous games really emerges in games later in an evening of multiple plays and increases the fun-factor.  There are always a lot of laughs interspersed with tense moments during an evening of The Resistance.

I own the version with the plot cards and would highly recommend them. Arguments suggesting they complicate the game are greatly exaggerated, but it is awesome that you can teach the game without them for a quick first round or two.

Very interesting social deduction game. The theme is great and fits the game superbly. The game is very hard to win for the rebels as the spies seem to have the edge in the base game. But playing the game is reward enough without even winning. The discussions, accusations and paranoid statements that go around each round are hilarious. Very interested in the plot cards and how they change the game.

After a few more games it seems the plot cards are really necessary to give the rebels any chance of winning. And even with them it's still hard as hell. But the fun does not suffer from the difficulty to win as the rebels. Still a great game.

RATING: 8
This is the game I was looking for when people tried to sell me on Werewolf. The concept is roughly the same, because the Resistance players have no genuine clues about the identity of the Spies, but here players aren't getting eliminated. I also like that you can use the voting to help deduce who might be working against the team. Then they add in those action cards which can give even more information, and I'm sold. It doesn't have quite the thematic thrill that I get from Shadow Hunters, but it's still fun. I like being on both sides of the game, and playing multiple games in one night is often more fun. Thankfully the game is also ridiculously short so you can play it as many times as you want in one session. Very fun game.

An extreme game which can be very fun or very boring. Requires players to be comfortable with each other for the bantering to start.

Best with 7-8 players. Do not recommend playing with less than that.

Played with 3 different groups. Was very entertaining with a particular group; whereby several players try real hard to convince others of their innocence and also provided analysis.

Players who are not flexible in playing, and especially dislike to lie, or very quiet could really spoil the game. For example, if the spy's identity is obvious, he could redirect attention to himself and even implicate an innocent player down as a fellow spy.

The special cards distributed by the leader adds flavor and dynamics to the game, when compared to Avalon.

Pro's:

1) The base game without the special powers is actually a great introductory game for newbies.
2) The game really benefits from having different personality types at the table.

Con's:

1) The game gets stale really quickly and can develop a really mathy metagame that ruins the fun social dynamic at play. I recommend playing with the 7+ player mark to hopefully mitigate this.
2) Someone with a really dominant personality can pretty much derail the game entirely. 
3) There may be a time when the game totally flops.

I don't get why this game has the praise that it does, at least in it's base form. I literally have no reason to believe why anyone is the spy or not. And the spys normally don't reveal who they are until nearly the end of the game.

You would have to really stretch your imagination to make this game fun. Unless you call yelling and blind accusations fun.

Will never play the base game again, but I would like to see how the expansions make it.

Fast and fun. Somewhere in between Werewolf and Shadow Hunters and certainly simpler than the latter (not always a good thing) without the first round shoe-staring moments of the former.

A witch hunt game: suspect everyone so when the game’s over you can say «I knew you were the infiltrator». In the usual run, a couple of players (those who know more deeply the game) will do all of the thinking while the others just follow their suggestions while understanding almost nothing of what’s happening around them, even when it’s their turn.

It’s pretty boring for the casual gamer. (September 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - After further playing it I’ve come to enjoy this game: undoubtedly it’s all about the right group.

Fun and laughter-inclined people around the table can do wonders indeed and my all-new feeling towards The Resistance is the result of sharing it with a bunch of loud and cheerful people: none of them joined my previous bleached attempts at this game, which therefore used to turn out too cold, analytical and success-oriented to be somehow entertaining, whereas it should be light, carefree and noisy to the extreme, just like we’re playing it now.

Due to this good experience, in October 2014 I’ve decided to raise my rating from 3 to 9, which now I feel fits the game way better.

I like the design goals, and the concept is a good one.  But three to five rounds is to me far too short to get any useful information at all *and* have time to put it to good use. I actually feel as though this game would be better if it were twice as long, so people can gradually form opinions based on observation and have an opportunity to use this info in a way that positively impacts the game.

Also, random annoyance: So one side is the Resistance, which is a group of saboteurs and spies fighting against some entity not appearing in the game. But the other side are Spies, a group of saboteurs and spies fighting against... the Resistance? So the Spies are basically a resistance against the Resistance, whom themselves you could call spies in a manner of speaking. So which is which again? Oh forget it.

This is a fun deduction/discussion game. The more people you can get to play the better. It's one of those games you could sit around the table, or just sit back on the couch. It's pretty straightforward to play an could probably be taught to most people.

The group I played with got tired of it after a few rounds because it's the same game each time. Once the group figured out each other's tells it was pretty easy for the Resistance side to win. I'm sure if we played again on a different night fun would have been had again =)

This game is super group dependent. I played a few times and had some laughs. Another time I played everyone just seemed bored. I suppose the same could be said about any social type game!

RATING: 8
This is a modern classic for a reason. I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica and the description of this game as "Pocket Battlestar" is apt. It carries some of the same, fun social misdirection games in a tight footprint of mechanics, rules and gameplay. The only criticism I could imagine for the game that it doesn't seem to have the kind of weight of having your success matter the way longer games like Battlestar do; it plays so quickly that it seems like you're playing about air; the deception is just for its own sake. That said, I can't imagine that anything else would be possible with a game lasting thirty minutes so that's not a fair criticism ultimately. Virtually every gamer should own this title. It fills a niche so perfectly that I can't imagine another title doing so in an improved fashion.

Edit: The Resistance: Avalon has essentially fired the original Resitance for me. Having the Merlin character just improves the game. It's still an 8, but Avalon is a 9.

Loved the game.  Great for a crowd.  Faster than Shadow Hunters, a bit more player interaction than Saboteur, but there remains a lack of true depth in the short play.  Five quick rounds can occur in 10 or 15 minutes without enough knowledge learned, so wildly guessing still may occur.

Still has nothing on a full Battlestar Galactica game if you have the time to play.

Great social deduction game.  The game is so simple and elegant, it kind of makes you wonder why someone didn't think of this sooner.  Basically a Werewolf type game with no need for a moderator.  It takes a while for a group to get used to it but once it starts to click its a really great, quick, fun, game.  Also great this is getting expansions to add the hidden roles from Avalon.

Love this game. You get the hidden traitor element (which you can tell I'm a fan of if you check out my other ratings), but without all of those pesky game mechanics. This game is better with more people obviously, and great with people that don't normally play board games.

Filler para grupos. Juego de deducción y faroleo. Hay dos bandos: los espias de la resistencia y los agentes del gobierno. En cada turno, un jugador propone un equipo para una misión (abstracta, no se realiza nada en la misión) y el resto de los jugadores vota para aprobar o no ese equipo. Cuando un equipo es aprobado, los jugadores del equipo juegan una carta que determinará si la misión tiene éxito. Uno tiene que deducir los votos de cada uno para averiguar quien es el espía y evitar que participe en misiones. Gana la resistencia si consigue que fallen tres misiones o el gobierno si consigue que tres misiones tengan éxito. Muy entretenido.

Excessive (and boring) table talk, overly simplistic. It's more fun just talking to my friends than playing this game.

I have recently played Secret Hitler, which is what this game wishes it was. The randomness of the cards allows for less clarity, which in turn allows for more bluffing. Nothing mind-blowing, but at least entertaining.

Otro de los pocos filler que me han gustado mucho. La resistencia que intenta atacar las bases, y unos infiltrados que sabotean los planes. Votaciones a cara de perro para decidir quien lleva a cabo los planes. Boicot. En fin, la simplificación-esencia de los juegos con sistema de votación.

A great time all around, and it has a great theme and looks sharp too! :)

Totally made Werewolf obsolete.

No moderator. No player elimination. More interesting discussions. Unlike in Werewolf, there's actually a basis to accuse someone with.

And why play Battlestar Galactica for 3 hours when you can play this in 30 minutes for the same feel.

The enjoyment of the game and its rating is highly group dependent. If you have a group of quiet euro cube pushers who prefer multiplayer solitaire, then this game will be a dud.

I am of the minority that highly prefer this to Avalon.

The rating is a 9.5 when the group dynamics are there. Otherwise the rating is a dud if you don't have the right group mix.

Hard to see how the Resistance can win. It's interesting and exposes some fascinating group dynamics, but it's too hard to put together 3 successful missions at any player count I've experienced. It was fun to play as a 'team building' event at work in September 2014.

Player interaction is very important for me and this game has just about the highest player interaction I have experienced in any game and therefore earns a lot of credit in this regard. It is also fun and short to play, but ultimately, when you strip it down, it is just a lottery. If you are a good guy you virtually have no control over the game in your efforts to win. As others have pointed out, if the spies play it well they should win everytime and 5 turns is also to short to make any meaningful deductions. The more you try and convince people the worse it gets as there is nothing you can actually show or do to prove your allegiance if you are a good guy. This is very frustrating and the game descends into a paranoic shouting match. I will play again as a filler as it is fun and amusing and if nothing better to play.

It's a great game, but without the roles of Avalon there aren't many ways to get information. The players need to be confrontational, trying to expose a liar, otherwise the game is reduced pretty much to guessing. In a group of experienced Werewolf players it is pretty hard to spot a liar, so the spies win most of the time with ease.

Much less interested in playing it again after trying it once (and not only seeing others play). If you have people who have no idea about game theory in the first missions the Resistance is bound to lose. If everyone knows a little game theory then either you can deduce the solution through logic (which would probably get old quickly), or it would still be a game of Mafia.

Social deduction game that involves lies as usual. This game shows how hard to beat the 'evil' one. Surely a party game due to its nature where the more the players are, the merrier this game will be. I have to admit, this game is quite imbalanced in terms of the winning chance. The spies would win much more often than the resistance side, I think it's because they knew each other beforehand. There's a very good alternative way of playing, in which even the spies do not know each other. Theme-wise, this alternative would be better because, on the field, intel agents even need to identify who is foe and friend by themselves, right? I still give high points for this game, though.

This low rating is probably a bit unfair - I'm just not a huge fan of this genre of games, which seems to have problems unless played by a group of close friends who all know each other. Anyway, this is not actually as bad as Werewolf, which has huge problems. But the Resistance will have a tough time losing in most setups. There is just too little information available to make sensible judgements, and it turns out people can't actually "read" each other, so they just go with their gut, which is annoying and usually wrong.

I dislike games like Werewolf to the extreme, and this is not far enough removed from such games to be much better.

Basically, The Resistance takes the whole secret role mechanic and puts a little meat on it in the way of structured voting.  Based on the results of various voting, players can deduce who the bad guys are, and thus keep them out of missions.  If enough missions succeed, the good guys win.  If not, the bad guys do.

It rates slightly better than Werewolf simply because it's over quickly, and there's at least some room for reasoning rather than blind guessing.  I see how people that are into this sort of thing enjoy it, but it's not for me.

The quintessential social deduction game, and for good reasons. Players must figure out the traitors of the group before they can sabotage 3 out of 5 missions. Like most games of this genre, the overall experience can vary significantly from group to group based on how much players enjoy the game and how familiar they are with each other. Without the expansions and the extra roles, the difficulty may be influenced by the player count based on on how many people are on each team. A classic of the genre for a reason.

Engaging social game which distills Battlestar Galactica down to its essence.  

The only flaw I've run into is that sometimes the game can end too fast or it can be a bit monotonous if the players don't really get into the social aspect.  A table of silent thinkers probably won't get the most mileage out of this one.

Don Eskridge should be applauded for fixing everything that was wrong with Werewolf as a game. This is brilliant design work. It's faster, no moderator, with actual clues, no player elimination, and can support as few as five players.

Unfortunately, after twenty or so games, with a few different groups, I think I've only seen the rebellion succeed once.

This feels like a gameier Werewolf which has, unfortunately, lost a little bit of its soul somewhere along the way. I'm not entirely sure why, but this never gets our usually raucous and suspicious group shouting and accusing. 

There's lots of room for bluff when you're a spy, and information for deduction when you're not, but I'm not sure I would characterize either as particularly "fun". There's something that just feels so dry and mathy about the whole experience.

Sidenote: The packed in expansion can be skipped. It just adds unnecessary chaos without much benefit.

Update: One Night Werewolf does everything I want from this game so much better. The added chaos of the roles and tension of the time limit make for a ton of laughs, accusations, and of course, panicked shouting. The only reason I keep this one around is it's about the only pure social deduction game that scales down to 5&6 well.

Update: Further lowing this to a four. I really just have no desire to play it ever. Too often does it drag out to excruciating 45+ minute games, and every game seems to follow the same script: first mission passes, regardless of number of spies in it > second mission: same people from the first mission +1 > if second mission failed, the +1 gets swapped for someone else, otherwise same people +1 > repeat. The effective elimination also bothers me - if you're outed as a spy early you just get to sit there the whole game. Blech.

RATING: 5
Not my favorite.  It isn't that I can't bluff successfully, it's that oftentimes this game can devolve into a "loudest voice in the room wins" scenario.  When I bluff, I tend not to be loud about it.  That can be a problem.  It will be a problem for anyone who isn't aggressive about accusing everyone else of treachery.

If you're the spy and you can successfully derail the game, sending the other players off to be bogged down in a quagmire of paranoid accusations and counter-accusations, it can be fun.  But most of time, it really isn't all that fun for me, even when I am on the winning side.

6.5 without The Plot Thickens cards.

For me, this is 2nd best when we don't have enough people for Werewolves, partly because the theme appeals less and partly because there are no special roles.

I like the logic, and the excitement of those crucial last-round decisions when you are pretty sure of all but one of the spies, and know that so much is riding on a lucky or unlucky guess as to the final spy.

Awesome party game. I think 6-7 players is where this game really shines. 5 players is too easy to find the spy and 8-10 players is too hard for the resistance to win and it can become just a shouting match. When you have a lot of players it really helps to have someone moderate it. I've tried to play and moderate at the same time and it's not very enjoyable.

Played this a couple of times now, each with 5 players. Both groups were not as talkative as I would have expected in this game. Without this it's difficult to obtain enough information to make enough of a deduction in just five rounds (or less). Spies have won both times, and I was Resistance in both games. Losses seem very frustrating and disheartening. Arguing that someone is a Spy and turns out is on your side isn't very fun at the end. I'm not sure this is the game for me.

RATING: 6
I know this is probably a great game with the right group, but so far my various gaming groups consist of 3-4 players or so. When we are finally 7+ or so we tend to play other games, and the first time I played this (with some non-gamers included) it fell flat. I played it a couple of times half a year later with another group, and this time it was a lot more pleasant.

I have to say, though, that the gameplay itself isn't that great, what's fun about the game is the interaction and accusations etc.! It's quite tough to figure out who's who within the first couple of rounds, and as it's over after at most 5 rounds, the actual gameplay feels a little limited - it's extremely hard to actually deduce who is who, and this is a factor I don't like much. I would argue that decent spys in a 7p game will win almost all of the time unless they make some questionable decisions. With 3 spies it is often tough for the resistance as it's going to be hard not sending a spy on a mission - especially as the spies can play a success card on the first mission (like most people do), and then it really doesn't give much information. What DOES reveal a lot of information is the voting pattern!

On the other hand, this game honestly needs to be played with experienced players who understands the game mechanics well - and what to do in order to get information! I've played it with so many new players who simply just don't understand the huuuuge importance of rejecting a mission... And then they sit back and wonder why they lost as the resistance!

If you include the plot cards, the game becomes more open and more based on facts and less on accusations. 

I will keep trying to introduce it to other people as I like games with hidden roles and traitor mechanics!
So, my rating will probably go up and if I find the right crowd to play it with, I can definitely see it be more like an 8 than a 6. But for now it's a 6 as it's a very situational game - it can be great under the right circumstances and fall flat under other.

RATING: 6
This game is what Werewolf, Mafia and Bang! should have been. Lots of scope for bluffing, arguing (in a nice way) and making partially informed decisions. More importantly there is NO elimination. It works with 5-10 though 6-8 seems to be best. With 9 or 10 it becomes very difficult for the resistance to win and some people will be left out of the missions entirely which can become boring for them. Play around a circular table if possible so as to involve everyone equally and to be able to observe all the subtle clues (particularly with the commander & bodyguard variant).

BASIC GAME: rated '6'.

Variants:

ADVANCED GAME with the plot cards - Not so much fun as the cards provide perfect information (at least for some) though this does enable the resistance to win in a larger group. It's quite possible to be 'outed' as a spy in round one which makes for a boring game. Rated '5'.

THE COMMANDER (Dumbledore) & BODYGUARD (Morpheus) - With the right crowd I'd rate this an '8'.

The above with the 'DEEP COVER SPY'. This particular spy is not known to the commander. Fun, too.

Wow, finally a great social interaction game that goes to 10p. This game is fun. I can see this being my go to game for large groups - and I am sure most people will have a great time playing. Highly recommended.

Update: I always take this game with me if I know there will be more than 5 players. You can teach it to anyone in about 3 minutes, and it takes about 10 minutes to play. Everybody has fun. The perfect filler for larger groups, and good enough to be the main course if needed.

Update 2: The deductive parts of the game become much less pronounced with more players - it turns into more guessing. It it still much more structured then werewolf, however, it turns into more of a social game then a deduction game.

Rated 9 after two back-to-back plays. What an absolute blast. This was advertised as a werewolf game with no elimination and that works with 6+ people. And, it delivers exactly as promised. Everyone pretty quickly got into the spirit of the game, and there was plenty of laughter.

Inexpensive, small box game that plays great up to 10 people and lasts less than 20 minutes? That's pretty much a no brainer for most collections.

Update: played this with some non-gamers... three straight games in a row. I'm shocked. This is a gateway game. We had an absolute blast. I still haven't played this with the expansion cards, and I anticipate those cards provide more information  that makes choices a bit more informed than simply reading people's poker faces. But the base game is very approachable for relatively inexperienced gamers. This is a wonderful game.

Update: tried this with 5 players. Ugh. This really is a 6+ player game.

Update: Played this with the expansion cards, and the extra information added really helps. When people are forced to vote first, or peek at mission card, or pass their loyalty card, it helps drive table talk, which is the heart of this game. Once people have played this once or twice, definitely give the expansion cards a shot.

Update: traded away, but only because I picked up The Resistance: Avalon. This is a great game, and frankly, people can choose the theme that suits them best.

The games I have played have been a lot of fun. However, it takes too long, each game is very samey and I think a lot of the games just come down to a guess by the resistance players. 

I have played quite a few games and seen three different players (all of whom are infrequent gamers) vote traitor when they are part of the resistance. This ruins the game and when asked why they all said something like "I'm crazy. I don't play by the rules." Strange but happening so frequently it is clearly a weakness of the game.

I both like and hate this game, and anyone who has played it can understand why.

Update on 1/6/12 a year or so since my first play and after a bunch of recent plays at the lab: All my comments below still apply, but i just keep enjoying it more and more after every play. Screw it! It's a 10. How could it not be given that I split my gut laughing EVERY SINGLE TIME. Admittedly, I wouldnt rate it as highly with a group of strangers. And the beer helps. But it is 100% smart fun.

Old comment from 1/11: A mini-surprise. I played back-to-back games of this us-versus-them deduction and bluffing game, playing on the 'spy' team both times. Now, I am terrible at bluffing and worse at deduction, so I really stunk up the joint. I'm pretty sure I helped bring down my team in the first game. The game was pretty wild and wooly - there were nine of us, of which three were spies, but in the end, it was a fun. Real fun. Not a pastime. Not interesting. No 'multiple paths to victory'. Just a hootin' time. It is likely that I enjoyed this because the company was good, the night was late, and the beer was plentiful. It usually wouldn't be a game I thought twice about. I'm glad I played.

I run a variant of this in my courses on Ancient Greece to simulate the Athenian assembly during the Peloponnesian War.  For advanced play I add rules for an Oracle and two Ostracism rounds.  It goes over very well.

I used to LOVE Mafia (Werewolf), but this works better when player elimination makes the losers grumpy.  On the other hand, player elimination is what makes the stakes in Mafia so high...

One day I'll pick up the published version to play with friends.

With 10 it was very easy for missions to have waaaay too many variables in them from turn-to-turn because nobody was really focused on this and rejecting missions was still poorly understood as to why you would want to do that, which resulted in us not really learning much each turn. 

But we yelled a lot and expressed frustration with each other, which we were all very entertained by!

Deduction done right.  I love the meta-game.
I remember finding this game in the database and reading session reports for it and thinking it sounded like the coolest thing ever.  When I got to play, I was not disappointed.

There are interesting decisions (if played correctly) to be made by both the spies and the resistance.  The benefit of forcing multiple votes for missions can really ratchet up the tension for the spies, as they have to remember to keep their stories straight.  Throwing the other spy under the bus can be a dangerous and rewarding endeavor if done at the right time.

I could go on and on about what I love about the game.  Timing, trust building, backstabbing... its all in this little box just waiting for you and the right group of people.  The only thing that brings it down is that it does need the right group of players.  But if you have that group, you will have some games you will remember.

The Resistance was an early game that removed player elimination, allowing all players to be involved in the game until the end. However, the game still does take a while, and games like One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Two Rooms and a Boom offer a quicker experience.

Still one of the best social deduction games, although it was a bit killed for me by Deception: Murder in Hong Kong due to that giving an effect of following a trail of bread crumbs rather than being entirely bluffing. This is still a great game though, and more portable.

I like this game to be Star Wars themed.  But either way, its a great idea for a group were-wolf type game. The benefit here is that there is no player elimination.  

We've found problem with scaling to some numbers of players, but there are a few rules modifications to account for that. 

I introduced this game to a group of casual/non-gamers and we had a great evening of fun.

RATING: 8
Rating is for the base game. Using the Avalon rules with Merlin/Assassin, I would give it a 9.5. You can do that with the base game by simply assigning roles to certain cards. The biggest flaw is the players -- people who aren't engaged can completely ruin what is otherwise an amazingly fun game.

RATING: 8
Really really good.
-1 because it has some player numbers where balance is a bit broken.

Compared to Avalon:
While it is good to have special roles included in Avalon leaving them out, especially Merlin, makes the game fairer. In Avalon as an evil one even if you are bad you have quite high chance to win just to pick someone randomly as Merlin. While it is fun I prefer this version over Avalon.
But this is such a minor difference both are great games.

Update from 9 to 8:
Avalon wins since you can play Resistance with it but it doens't work on the other way.

Great game for large group of players where even Incan Gold or Bohnanza fails to accommodates. It's a very social game so I enjoy it for the accusations and sly deals more than winning in itself. However, i find that generally the good guys have an easier time winning. It's just not easy to lie and it's easily deduced by other players. of cos, i know this is a group think situation, but i cant change my friends. :) 

Update:01/01/2016: Since Avalon was released, it totally replaced the original resistance for me.

It's a nice hidden identity game, and everyone has lots of fun accusing someone else of being a spy, just because their hair is parted on a different side that day!

I grew up with murder in the dark. Then, played some games of werewolf/mafia. When we discovered Resistance, our minds were blown. We played this game soo many times. This was a solid 8 for a long time, but over repeated plays I find that the arguments and discussions become pretty repetitive. These days Resistance has been replaced by Coup, Two Rooms and a Boom, and most especially Secret Hitler. I think SH took what Resistance started and improved upon it in virtually every way except the controversial theme (which unfortunately limits it's ability to get to the table in some situations).

Need to replay this one, but basically really lackluster when I tried it. I thought the game moved a little quick and it was pretty hard to deduce things with the amount of time/rounds given. I've been meaning to dust it off as I got it years ago but haven't gotten around to it.

Still, not the worst game I've played especially for the amount of money. I've also played Avalon and think that one goes a bit better.

[u]Bluffing[/u] and deduction party game with great fun.
Homemade copy for 5 players using some [i]Coup[/i] cards, normal cards and poker chips:
- 2 Assassins (for spies) and 3 Contessa (for Res. team);
- Normal cards from a deck (5 red & 5 black) for all voting;
- Poker chips (1 Dealer Leader, 3 blue as guns, red/black for the board).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very simple werewolf like game that may lack a little balance - it seems to be heavily favouring the empire spies. But is very fun none the less for the bluffing, attempted puzzling logic and more bluffing. 

3:2
2 wins as Empire
1 Win as Resistance
2 Losses as Resistance

I think the game may actually play better if the spies do not know who each other are.

The resistance is a fixed version of werewolf. The level at which you can play it is in a different stratosphere to it. This is not a game where the good guys can randomly victimize people, because if they do, they will lose, 100% of the time. The only real issue is that it does require every player to fully engage, otherwise it won't work.

RATING: 7.5
A good little game of group paranoia, this distills down the traitor element from Werewolf and Battlestar Galactica to its purest form.  Players first find out their role, then select each other for "missions" that could end up being successes or failures, based on cards played by the mission specialists.

REVISED RATING - After clarifying some key rules and adding in the plot cards, my opinion of the game improved greatly (6 to 7.5).  I see no reason not to use the plot cards, as it's easily understood, and creates more balance in the game, with some exciting twists.  This can really be a lot of fun, and I can see multiple plays per sitting to be normal.

RATING: 4
Fairly fun social deduction game. The basic rules don't really offer much opportunity for deduction, so, once the players have learned not to give themselves away as spies, accusations seem to be based on little more than random guesses and groupthink. Optional rules like the Plot Thickens cards or the Merlin role from the Avalon edition (which requires no extra components to use in the regular edition of Resistance) give players more information to work with, though, and make it more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Deep and interactive, chills running down your spine if you have some info and can't disclose it.

RATING: 4.5
Similar to Werewolves, but has the advantages that no one gets eliminated from the game prematurely and that it can sensibly be played with as few as 5 players.
In order to play it with more than 10 players (where Werewolves probably begins to get better), you would need to make houserules and own a second set of Resistance, though.

I love social deduction games and I love Coup Indie Games), so we thought we'd try this one out.  We, so far, have focused on the base game only.  I imagine, over time, we may want to explore expansions.  

It has a Mafia/Werewolf feel.  You do need to deceive and that can get intense, depending on the players.  But there's a twist.  You vote with cards anonymously.  There is a deduction element and voting element.

The good: no one is eliminated and the game goes pretty fast.  We played two games in 25 minutes.

Excellent social game and one of the best.  I think i've played this game well over 100 times and it still never gets old.  I enjoy it at the lower player counts (5-7 players).  Works well as a party game, filler game, gateway game, and can even take over a game night.  Fast and addicting what's not to love. Playing in teams is always something fun and different. I think this game has to be one of my 10's.  It offers one of the most fun and unique experiences in tabletop gaming (no offense but Werewolf, Saboteur and all the other similar games have NOTHING on the elegance and greatness that is The Resistance).

RATING: 5
Components: Not a great production design, making the common mistake (in my book) of trying to accomplish entirely with cards what should have been done with other media. 1) the leader should be a pawn; 2) the identity cards should be entirely unlike the other objects, so we don't accidentally reveal them (e.g. tokens); 3) the mission votes should be via colored beads into a little opaque sack (and the remaining bead could go into another little sack), so that they are pre-mixed prior to counting, and it's much easier to return the unused bead without showing it. Too many similar components for a game where only half the people have an incentive to be guarded with their actions; it's too easy for the honest person, who doesn't have anything to hide, to accidentally reveal that, in fact, they are with the resistance.

Experience: I like that there is no moderator, and that there is such a narrow time window for success for both teams. In my one playing, I made several errors that cost my spy team the game, which is a positive aspect to me, because it means that player decisions actually matter, and that there is strategy.

I dislike the resistance/spy theme, because they both imply subversiveness, and my group had trouble remembering which one was trying to undermine the other.

2013: Fantastic game of deduction and social interaction! It's just about the perfect party game since it plays fast and equally well with 5-10 players. Top-notch components. Excellent value. A must-have for every game collection.

2016 Update: Unfortunately, my gaming group and/or I burned out on playing it. I haven't gotten it to the table in a couple years.

The ultimate party game.  Take away the theme and you can still just play the game.  I've played this with gameers and non-gamers and everyone loves it.  This is an awesome game to take with you camping, bring to a party, or work/family function.  Plays quick and is vastly superior to Werewolf because you don't need a moderator.

It's been said elsewhere, but this is the essence of Battlestar Galactica playable in 15-30 minutes.  Truly a delight to play, and the fact that it plays 5-10 people makes it PERFECT for the lunchroom table, or a big game day gathering.  I don't think it's possible to play it just once... too much fun to put it away...

RATING: 6
Fun game. We ran through it three times with seven people. We may have been playing it wrong, but there was some question as to whether or not the leader should change after each mission. The rules say that when a mission fails the leader passes clockwise. It doesn't say anything about the succession of a mission, though the inference is that if it succeeds then the leader would not change. However, depending on whether the leader is a spy or not, he pretty much controls it after the first successful mission because he just knows. Might be better with more people.

Mar '16 (16 plays) - 8.9. Redoing ratings and upgrading to 8.9 because it's one of my favorite games. Very emotional game. I like to house-rule that you have to tell the story of what missions we're going on. Not rated a 9 because it's hard to get the perfect 7 players to play, and other player counts don't feel as balanced.

RATING: 8.3
This is an instant classic and took the social experience of One Night Ultimate Werewolf and turned it into an actual game.  The combination of hidden roles with social deduction and voting on who goes on the mission to score the round creates the experience of Werewolf but streamlines it and gives it order.
6-8 players is absolutely the sweet spot but if you have that size of a gathering you can allow anyone from a hardcore strategy gamer to someone who's never played a game in their life to have a blast.

RATING: 7
The original social deduction game, and definitely a classic.  The only reason it got cut for me is because it doesn't make a great first impression.  No one really figures out the optimal strategies and behavior, or when to vote for or against a team, until repeated plays.  And with my limited opportunities for 5+ player gaming, that rarely happens.

Likewise, the extra roles are cool, but they don't come out until everyone learns the basic game.  For me, that rarely happens.

So, while often dream of what this game could be (same for Dead of Winter) it just doesn't happen for me.  I need my large player games to be instantly grokkable.

One of my early plays was dominated by verbose alpha players dragging the game well beyond it's staying point, which soured me on this.  Ultimately there will always be a degree of crapshoot involved, so why drag it out as if it's something more meaningful than that?

Have had better experiences since, but still only like to play this if lacking other options.

Expectations were high, but after 3 plays of The Resistance I'm impressed.

Compared to Werewolf:
- the deduction-game is more intense
- psychology is a bit different: no 'life-threatening' situations, but still a very paranoid experience
- players do not die - so most of the times the game stays interesting for all players.
- expansion cards add some nice twists. Smart spies can use the obvious disavantage of the cards to great effect.
- no neutral "story-telling" player needed, so everyone participates in the action.

So, if you are a fan of werewolf: try it! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Resistance distills the best element of most hidden role games into its very core. The possibilities for deduction, paranoia and social interaction are almost endless. The only fault of The Resistance is that because of its pure focus on the traitor-aspect makes it a bit dry and devoid of theme (regardless of the backstory it has). Still, I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a great social experience game, as it definitely shines in that area.

Brilliant co-op with a traitor game that can be played in 15-20 minutes and still feel satisfying.  I think there are some balance issues that are mostly addressed with the expansion cards that come with the game, but the trick is figuring out when to use those based on the number of players.

Seriously fun though.  You are almost guaranteed to play several games back-to-back.

Tried it once and it bombed so hard. It basically got analyzed to death during introduction, reduced to a multiplayer version of mastermind. Note to self: if you're taught that there is basically only one right way to play the game, there is just about zero replayability.
Might be a good game with the right crowd, but I can't stomach going back and trying again (now that phase 1 and 4 are basically solved with only 3 rounds of mastermind left).
It would be unfair to give a bad rating, but I will give the game... away.

I've said everything I needed to say in my Secret Hitler review. I think The Resistance is a good game and it had it's time in the spotlight but for me personally it's been replaced by Secret Hitler.

I said it in the Secret Hitler review but I'll say it here too. The Resistance feels more like a logical deduction game dealing with facts and less of the social aspect of reading people. Secret Hitler deals with probabilities and uncertainties with waaaaay more human psychology and soical interactions. As a long time poker player I prefer the latter.

Received this for my birthday in 2013 and it's hit the table lots of times.  This is one of my favorite games to play, but normally our regular gaming groups are 4 people, not the 5+ that it requires.

This game is the best game I have ever played. It is a short (30 minute) game with an excellent traitor mechanic. Provided your group doesn't have an issue with lying, the game is loads of fun and different strategies are used for each game to throw off the resistance members.

The game is easy to learn and always a great laugh. It doesn't take long to play, so one game is always possible at the end of a gaming night. Furthermore, the game itself is exciting enough to play several times in a row, so it's easy to fill a few hours of gameplay with just the resistance.

The Resistance is my go-to game to bring to gatherings/events where there will be a good-sized group of people who want to play a game. I love the tension this game brings, and people really get into the game quickly even if it's their first game. It's always fun to see everyone trying to figure out who the spies are, and watching everyone accusing each other from the moment the game takes off. One note of caution: in my experience, people who are more sensitive or don't like confrontation do not seem to enjoy the game as much. It can be frustrating for some players if they know they are not a spy and everyone is yelling at them calling them a spy. It's just part of the game, but it's just not some people's cup of tea.

Basically, it's Werewolf, but no one ever gets eliminated and sits out... and eyes only have to be closed once briefly... and there's no need for a non-player narrator... and there's a bit more information to go on... and as few as 5 players can have a great game.

Really, the only way Werewolf is superior is in theme and support of very large groups. (The theme of The Resistance is not at all as compelling as Werewolf... the Battlestar Galactica re-theme is better in that regard.)

De leider kiest spelers voor een missie. Elke speler mag deze missie goed- of afkeuren. Bij een gelijk aantal stemmen gaat de missie niet door en wordt de volgende speler leider. Wanneer een missie 5 keer wordt afgewezen, scoren de spionnen een punt. 

Wanneer de missie doorgaat, maken de geselecteerde missieleden in het geheim hun keuze. Leden van The Resistance stemmen altijd positief. Spionnen mogen zowel positief als negatief stemmen. Als alle kaarten positief zijn: 1 punt voor the resistance. Als er minstens 1 kaart negatief is: 1 punt voor de spionnen. Wie als eerste 3 punten scoort, wint. 

Elke leider mag tijdens zijn beurt aan een speler naar keuze een plotkaart geven.

Plotkaart met leidersymbool: meteen uitspelen.
Plotkaart met cijfer 1: op een moment naar keuze uitspelen
Plotkaart met vierkant: blijven liggen tot het einde van het spel.

Probably 9 or 10 months before writing this I tried to make my own version of the Resistance to see if I liked it before I bought it. It fell real flat with my wife's family, who was the primary group I played One Night Ultimate Werewolf with. It just didn't seem to have the intensity and excitement of ONUW. I had pretty much written off the game as a duller (but necessary) precursor to the great game that came to be ONUW.
That is until last week. I was at a local bargain store, and I found the Resistance on the shelf for $5. Being the board game enthusiast that I am, there was no way that I could pass up such a popular game for so cheap, even if I didn't really like it. I took it to a game night last Friday night, and boy was it fun. I'm not sure what we did wrong the first time, or if it's just that the real components provided for more discussion, but I finally understand the praise this game has gotten.

We have a bigger gaming group (usually 7-8 people each time) and Resistance hits the table more than probably any other game we play. I love the interaction and the way we all start accusing each other of being a spy. Lots of fun although it seems like the spies almost always win.

Drops another few notches as Secret Hitler has mostly surpassed this one for me, albeit, The Resistance is a little cleaner on the rules, and the better intro game.

[December 2015 - 8.8]
It slips by a few notches. Still a great game, but there are some other quick games moving up my charts these days that I'm enjoying more. It can get a little stale in instances with the same players, but new players still absolutely love it!

[July 2014 - 9.0]
What can you say that hasn't been said before about this game? What makes it fantastic is introducing it to new players -- particularly a group where not everyone knows each other, or perhaps among co-workers, who never see this side of you. For those reasons, this game's simplicity and speed put it above others that are a bit more complex. Yes, if you just play with the same people all the time it starts to lose its appeal because everyone only has so many tricks up your sleeve. So find new players to play it with!

Lying, backstabbing and false accusations. What's not to like? Seriously, this game is just plain fun although I can imagine that it's not for everyone. It's a quite chaotic and loud experience as a member of the resistance since you never can be sure who is on your side and who is not. As a spy, you have to lie and blame other people. If this sounds like fun to you, go and get The Resistance.

If you have a group of smart, outgoing, talkative people this game is absolutely amazing. I've never felt so much tension, frustration, and pure excitement in a game. Perfect!

Edit: Nothing does what this game does. There is nothing in the world that could cause me to, after 30 min spent with total strangers, jump up and hug them like long lost friends, just because we won. You see, it wasn’t just ‘winning’, it’s the fact that we (the good team) were each alone, not knowing who to trust, and we read the group as best we could, and decided who to trust and who not to trust, and we were right!

Resistance is life in 30 minutes.

So, never having played this before I played 2 games, was a spy both times.  The spies even won one of the games.  Yes, it was fun, but I really don't care for these types of games - for 2 reasons.  First, I just don't get the strategy, and second,  I don't lie very well at all.

This is a social game, I feel, sometimes misses the mark as far as interaction is concerned. While, yes, it is a social and interaction-based game only, there is nothing about this game that I have found that pulls everyone in, including the introverts, into interacting. Of course, people should play however, they like, but sometimes I find people just sit through games without doing anything, especially in the larger games involving more people. That said, it is still a solid gateway game with a good modern theme.

This is a traitor game reduced to the basic essence of a traitor game - there are no other frills or chrome - just the traitor bit. But that is the intention and as such it works well enough to provide a fun filler experience on most outings.

Is subject to occassional 'breaks' - i.e. a lucky/unlucky first choice of mission team vitually throws the game one way or another. However on the flip side with more players and the right crowd this can be a very fun game - probably means it rates somewhere between a 6.5 and an 8.5 depending on the day.

Love this game it's like Battlestar Galactica without the faff of having to shoot stuff it's the traitor mechanic gloves off anything goes all boiled down to it's raw pure form. My two favourite sessions of this were the first one where after being introduced as a new player with a load of others who had played this before I pretended to not quite understand the rules and asked to clarify how many spies there were after the shutting eyes phase. This made the others rule me out immediately after all how could I not know how many spies there were if I was one of them... muhaha, we (the spies) won that game easily. My other favourite session was where I was again selected as a spy, I spent a considerable amount of time working over a long suffering friend buttering him up and getting him in my pocket. At the start of the game he was a leader and picked me for his sole companion, we laughed and joked and the cards were revealed and the mission failed. I acted astonished and turned the tables on him saying that he was rigging the vote and making it look like I was the spy and that was fine just don't put me on any missions for the rest of the game. I did such a good job he decided that he must have made a mistake and ended the game prematurely which was logged as a technical win for the spies as I flipped my card over to reveal the spy. He trusted me more than his own brain and I have not let him live it down since. Brilliant stuff!

A social deduction game.  For a game like this, I have to be in the right mood and be around the right players.  Breaking this game out with a bunch of folk who like brainy, strategy, war-games is going to fall a bit flat. It's fast though so that is good...so a good fun filler.  I don't think I can rate too much higher than a 6 because it is basically a "play the player" type game...which is not my favorite genre.

RATING: 8
Players are either loyal members of the Resistance, fighting missions against the Empire, or spies of the Empire, trying to sabotage the Resistance missions.  Simple card based voting game, where one player nominates a team of players to go out on a "mission".  A secret ballot is cast to see if the team is approved - if not, another team is proposed and voted on, etc.  Once the team is settled, those chosen secret vote the mission as successful or failed.  Three successful missions means players on the Resistance wins, otherwise three failed missions gives the win to the spies.  A vast improvement on Werewolf, where you always fear a random early exit - no player elimination, and a nice hunk of logic involved.  Very good.

RATING: 9
After a quick two games, this seems like a pretty cool game. Strange mix of bluffing, rational thinking, and straight up intuition (for better or for worse), it's a game I am NOT very good at (both games people were convinced I was the spy [they were right once]. both times it led to my team losing). Need to play this one more to get the hang of the politics of it all.

Edit (20AUG2011): So I have this game for a while, and I've got to say, it's pretty darn fun. The subterfuge of spy play is a bit nervewracking, but I admit it's great fun to somehow convince all the resistance members to put the mission into your hands, just to crush their hopes at a round 5 victory. Of course, it's even more satisfying to root out the spies and achieve rare but glorious victory over the evil power of your choice. Not for everyone, but overall a great game. Rating +1!

Have the retail copy now.  I've played the playtesting copy before and the Plot cards really add to the game by providing several more layers of information.  1) Who the leader is giving the good/bad cards to 2) Who the people with the cards choose to use it on and 3) The actual effects of the cards themselves

If BSG and Werewolf had a baby, it would be this game.

1) Like BSG and Werewolf, it has hidden good guys and bad guy roles
2) Like Werewolf, it's more of a party game (5-10 players)
3) Like Werewolf, it's pretty simple and does not require a lot of explaining to new players
4) Like Werewolf, it doesn't take 3 hours
5) Like Werewolf, there's an open voting phase, but instead of choosing who to kill, it's whether the chosen people get to go on the mission
6) Like BSG, It has hidden "skill checks" (missions) where the bad guys can choose to support or sabotage
7) Like BSG, there is no player elimination
8) Like BSG, there are ways you can look at someone's loyalty card or assign them special roles (with the Plot cards in the retail copy)

For me, this is 90% of the fun of Battlestar Galactica in 10% of the time.  I'll take that deal!

My favorite thing about the new edition is that some of the cards are replaced with tokens.  The original edition had too many types of cards floating around!  I do miss the original's very small box, but the larger boards are nice to have.

UPDATE Jan 2013:
I think this game is the pinnacle of the "traitor" genre.  It cuts out all the crap and just delivers the fun in a tight little package.

cf Avalon for comments.

I record plays under this box if I'm playing with a deck of cards or with another's copy of the base game. If you know you're getting the expansions, you should probably pick this up with the various expansion boxes rather than Avalon. Otherwise, Avalon should have more than enough content for anyone, and the special roles are far better than the abysmal plot cards.

Overall, I have never seen the resistance win against the Corporation unless the Corporation makes a mistake during the game.

I enjoy the game but never expect to win since I rarely get to be the Corporation.

Update: I've now seen the corporation win a few times.  However, I am extremely bad at this game.  When I am the resistance I simply cannot figure out who is the corporation and especially when the corporation I can't keep a straight face which ultimately leads to me being found and I am effectively out of the game at that point.  

I don't mind hidden role games but I prefer ones that have additional effects once I am "found out".  Ones where my objective or at least actions change when I am revealed as a traitor instead of basically ruling me out of the game.

I rate and consider both Resistance and the Avalon version as if they were one in the same - I always play Resistance with Merlin/Assassin (barring brand new groups) and I never play Avalon with anything more than Merlin/Assassin (I don't have any group who's interested in exploring these other routes.)

Resistance is a fine social-deduction game, and I'm sure you've heard of it if you're on this site. There's tension, betrayal and confusion - everything you need for a blast. While I'd still rank it above many of the social-deduction games that have come out since, the game has worn on me (I would have rating it an 8 or higher back in its heyday.)

I would always take a game of Deception over Resistance.

This isn't as bad as some purely social games.  You do get a little actual information in the system, so it's not all lies and bluffing.  It seems pretty unlikely for the spies to lose if they do their job, though, especially on higher player counts.  
The included variant does a bit to improve it (giving you more than just a scrap of info).

●Introduced and owned by a friend (thanks!!).
●Played my 1st werewolf styled game last night. I have to say that it was a hit with the meet up, with about 10+ count of plays.
●Rule is simple, and what else to admire other than the mechanics. Components wise, they're simple yet work, artworks are nice, and the game are based on card. Most important, with all mixed in the bowl, surprisingly, the theme is there.
●We played numerous rounds that night with the same group (new players added through the night), and I have to say that we were not sick of it, although I believe at one point, we will get bored if played with the same group. It's just that, the amount of plays you need to get to achieve that level of boredom is pretty high.
●It's not an urgent must have, but will get it if the price is right (not on sale in the country yet at the time of writing), and with it being a party game, the chance to have it is on the high side.
It was sweet and fun.

First: You need to play with friends that are likely to participate actively, because the resistance is a game that requires creating an environment, and the game itself doesn't have it. 
It's a game for a big group of friends, you need to try connecting with the others to gain confidence or attract their attention, all depends on your role as an ally or a spy. 

A lot of fun, a lot of cheats. A big party game in a small box.

Some say this is substitution for Mafia/Werewolf and they might be right, but for me Mafia is irreplaceable. However, when there are less than 10 people and more than 5, with mixed knowledge and feelings about board games, it could be the very pocket in which the Resistance shines.
It is straight, fast and fun, cool with variants even cooler without them. There is no player elimination which is a big plus in comparison to Mafia, and there is no moderator for eyes are closed only at the beginning of each game (or not at all if playing the blind spies variant), so it is more fluid and less loud. Which is not necessarily an advantage.
Hostile indent and hidden agenda expansions turn this game to Mafia without player elimination and moderator. Well they turn it to Avalon literally, so it's a win.

Having played both this and werewolf dozens of times now, i've decided i prefer werewolf.

This game is more intense, especially in my group. Its got to the stage where its pretty argumental and although i win often enough, not that satisfying. 

Player order is pretty key here. There is no player order in werewolf.

You pass the leadership card around in one direction, so it often makes sense to take risks on players who are a long way from getting to be team leader again. This and other deductions are standard practice in my group and breaking them leads to immediately being labeled spy. 

If the spies are last in turn order (unlikely but it does happen) then they have a real uphill struggle as the resistance can with a bit of luck win the game with out them ever getting a say in it.

The expansion cards up the conflict and argument in the game even more. The can force players to show their hidden cards to another player whilst everyone else is watching. This can lead to some very heated arguments over who is a spy and who is lying. If you like this, you will love this game. Personally i don't mind it as long as it remains light hearted. In Werewolf the greater ambiguity keeps it light, here intensity reigns.

I really like the mistrust this game sows amongst people at the table.  The only problem with it is that if someone is pegged early as being a spy (which isn't the easiest role to have, mind you), then you're pretty much excluded from everything, leading to a boring experience.  This can be compounded by some of the long discussions at the table as people try to suss out the other spies while you simply observe.

So why did I bump this from 5 to 8?
Because someone told me:
"If you in the first round vote YES on a mission you are not on, it implies that you are a spy. Having no information on people, would make it a bad situation to send to strangers, when the could send you.
However. If you ARE a spy, you KNOW if one of the to on the mission is a spy, and might therefor vote YES."

We played it at Essen2014 - and it was a blast. Shouting and accusing each other, trying the strangest deductions; I think the rest of the game room hated us.

They should have been envying us.

Love the game. Probably with the right crowd.

I was lucky enough to get out of the house with my husband on game night at the FLGS (a first for us!).  We were able to play this game with 10 people and it was super fun.  I do wish I was able to observe more, but the group we played with threw me right into the gameplay; drafting me into missions and handing me all sorts of equipment cards that I didn't understand.  

I was a bit defensive as I didn't know more than half the group, but I can see how much fun this game could be with friends.  I just wish I could play it again sometime :)

Edit:  We managed to get five in the house to play and it was great!  Most exciting to me was learning how terrible all my friends were at lying :p.

Also, you need to play it with the right people. Some people don't get the game or just don't see the fun in it because they focus on the mechanics, while, of course, most of the fun here resides on the interaction, the bluffing, the joking, the trash talk and the deceiving. I would play this game every time someone asked me to. Would like to try the Avalon version or at least integrate the Assassin and Merlin in this version somehow.

I consider The Resistance to be a condensed version of BSG.  By looking at it this way I am surely setting myself up for a downfall as I consider BSG to be my favorite game.  If you like BSG but find it to be too long and fiddly, then this or Shadow Hunters is probably the game for you.  I should probably compare The Resistance to Werewolves as they have a similar weight.  Well, this one has no player elimination which is a good thing.  Regarding player numbers, The Resistance plays from 5 - 10 people whereas Werewolves I only consider to be good when you have 10+ people, therefore neither game makes the other obsolete.  The only thing I can say is that right now I have only played this game with 5 players which I don't think would be optimal number and without any of the Plots which I think would make the game more interesting.  So I rate the game a tentative 6 and I can only see it's score increasing with further plays.

My first and stil favourite hidden role game. While now I enjoy a few tweaks, house rules, modules, etc, even the base game creates great tension and amazing stories. 
I remember when I first saw this on Tabletop (before playing), I was excited by the possibilities and how much fun it looked - and it has not disappointed.
Best moments: 
- Gus losing it for Graham and me in Bruges, with much (good natured) abuse
- 'Deep cover' Cawley announcing his role too early
- Playing whole listening to the interstellar soundtrack.

And if I want to play guessing game, I rather play Dixit.

A well designed sabatoge game. It's short, and it does not require a moderator to play. The pro and con of this game is its length. If you pull of a great con, or see through someone's deception you are going to be missing the build up that really makes that victory sweet. But, on the plus side, you are now getting a high-player number filler that is really lean.

Sometimes I love this game and sometimes I hate it. The problem with games like this is that a good or bad group makes all the difference. One player that doesn't "get it" or doesn't put any effort into it can really ruin the experience for everyone. That being said, a group of players who really get into it can make this game a really great experience!

Usually this is the first game that gets brought out when we have 6-10 people since it fills the large player slot so well.

For such a small, quick game, this one has gotten a ton of play. It delivers a lot of player interaction and tension.  My one gripe is that it's a little unbalanced in favor of the spies (a fact which is readily identified in the rule book).  This is especially noticeable in certain player counts.  The prob is partly addressed by the expansion, but that adds complexity which is not always ideal for newcomers.  If you love lying to your friends and family or accusing them of being a treacherous ne'er-do-well, this game is for you!

[2 plays]  I looked forward to playing this game, but it fell a bit flat.  One possible reason is that I played with a group of people who were mostly also new to the game.  From what I've heard about this, it sounds like the subtleties of the game really emerge as you gain more experience with it.  

My first game could be a useful lesson in what to avoid in a first game: the randomly-chosen start player, deciding who to send on a mission, randomly decided to go with the next players to his left.  This resulted in the development of a small bloc of players early in the seating order who trusted each other, and kept choosing each other for missions.  It also resulted in half the people on the other side of the table feeling bored, unengaged, and fundamentally irrelevant to the game.  

I enjoy Werewolf in moderate doses, and this was supposed to be like Werewolf, only better.  It was also supposed to be a deduction game, and I love deduction games.  Instead of an awesome game that I'd really like, what I found in the Resistance--which is also of value--was a lesson about some things I really do and don't like in games.  

First of all, the Resistance really seems to me to be in the category of games where the game provides a structure to hang stuff on, but the bulk of the substance of the experience is brought by the players--or not.  Such games can shine under the right circumstances, but they are really vulnerable to fizzling with players who don't like them, or just don't get them.

Secondly, I love hardcore games of actual pure deduction, like Sleuth.  Games where there is something to be figured out, and the players are competing with each other to figure it out.  I don't so much care for games where what the players are trying to figure out is each other.  This is a game with a huge psychological element, where your deductions and observations and theories are all about the behavior and motivations of the other players.  Even in regular nondeductive boardgaming, I'm more of the "play the game, not the players" school of thought, as opposed to the other end of the spectrum with those who feel that every game is really about the metagame of playing the players.  

So the Resistance, though it may be great for those who like that sort of thing, is just not my cup of tea.  And I think I'll remember, next time a game like this comes along, not to get my hopes up.

Surprisingly challenging party game. Akin to Werewolf but for smaller groups and there is no player elimination. This first time I played this it sucked. The group did not get it at all. But every time I've played it since then it's been an absolute blast. BTW, I'm terrible at this game, I never win. But I love party games where everyone is engaged the whole time. I also like the "Plot Thickens" cards, but you don't need them to introduce new players to the game and have a great time.

Ever played werewolf, and thought "Man, this would be a great game if only..."?
Look no further. This is a game about deduction, paranoia, and convincing your peers that you aren't the traitor. Especially the last one.
No elimination, no game master, no randomness, no need to be 20 for it to be interesting. Great game for people that would never touch a boardgame. Assured laughs and "WTF!?" moments when the bad guys reveal themselves at the end of the game!

The 2nd version is a significant upgrade IMO, a higher quality presentation  with better pieces and gameboards.  A top 5 game for me.

[b][thread=644607]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "The Resistance"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]21[/b] plays) A fantastic hidden-role alternative to [GAMEID=925], evoking similar levels of tension, suspicion and paranoia. The secret plans mechanic gives people more information to work with, but it is still predominantly a thrilling psychological exercise. I prefer this to pure Werewolf, in part because there is something [i]relatively[/i] tangible to work with from the start and there is no player elimination. The only thing that keeps it from being a "10" for me is that I get extremely tense when I play, and can only manage one or two games in a row before feeling totally burned out.

[b]Why this is in my Top Ten:[/b] This is, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate hidden roles/traitor game. The basic premise is so simple and elegant, but the logic, intuition and persuasion required to play it well is phenomenal. Not everyone will like or "get" this game, and I will probably never attempt to play it with my family, but a well-played game of Resistance is absolutely unparallelled in the levels of tension and suspense that it generates. 

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] Still my favorite hidden roles/traitor game ever. I prefer the plain vanilla version, without plot cards complicating its inherent elegance.

Literally the best game for people who don't like board games. Not going to lie, I actually really enjoyed this game too. The components are almost completely unnecessary as you could play this game with some regular playing cards and have the same experience. The art is nice but really adds nothing to the game. Fun deduction game with a large group.

Superb social game, similar to Werewolf but arguably better (no player elimination, more info to use for deduction, and caters for smaller groups).  If you enjoy games with hidden roles, this is essential.   

Can introduce to [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5929544#5929544]non-gamers[/url], but the Plot cards are essential for games with 7-10 players so it can be harder to teach larger groups of newbies.  Don't miss correcting the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5602071#5602071]misprint[/url] in the first edition rules about the number of Plot cards to use.

Strictly speaking, I prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf (if not WW itself), but I have a group that enjoys playing this as the evening ender and for the most part I enjoy it. 

However, we play Avalon which is the version I prefer due to the added layer of the Merlin Call as the end of the game and the roles that play into that. I’m not a fan of the cards in this one; let a pure deduction game be pure deduction.

Imprescindible jugar sin que los espías sepan quiénes son de los suyos, si se juega como dice el reglamento, es absolutamente imposible ganar para los rebeldes y se hace frustrante.

Nice when you want the Werewolf/Mafia feel without risk of being eliminated from the game.  Miss the different roles/powers of Werewolf/Mafia so I can see myself falling back on them depending on my mood, but this game is good fun if you like bluffing, playing mind games, and trying to read other people.

Awesome game for 7 or more people. Really tough, if you're the resistance, but I love playing both sides. When you're the spy the trick, at least for me, is to play as if I'm the resistance. Super fun game, and a awesome mechanic!

The Resistance is a very compelling social deduction game of hidden roles.  How well this game is received seems to depend entirely on the group.  I have only played with 7 so far and have yet to try the plot cards, but my initial impression is that although everyone enjoyed it, it seemed way too hard for the resistance players with this number.  The base game is pretty easy to grasp for non- or casual gamers.  I fear that the plot cards may change that.

Az abszolút kötelező társas, ha nagyobb társaságot (5-10 fő) akarok szórakozásra bírni! A titkos szerepválasztós, következtetős játékok nagyon jó alapot adnak a partijátékoknak. Ez pedig az egyig legélvezetesebb, és legegyszerűbb közülük. Nagyon egyszerű (3 perc alatt elmagyarázható), nagyon gyors (társaságfüggő, de kb. 15 perc), és nagyszerű ár/érték bajnok társasjáték! Nem árt hozzá megfelelő társaság, élvezetesebb, ha oda-vissza megy az egymás bevádolása, de akkor sincs baj, ha valaki passzívabb a társaságban, ő is élvezni fogja.

RATING: 6
The cliche fits: It's "Battlestar Galactica Lite." Its distillation allows you to kill an entire evening, but once the game starts to get "gamed," or mathed-out, it fails to be entertaining, only antagonizing. A worthwhile addition to a new collection, but plenty of other deception-style games have more meat with, albeit, more play time. The short games lend themselves to The Resistance's strengths, but the games become just a tad too long to be worth the trouble. For a shorter game, try Coup, which demands a spot in everyone's collection. For longer, try Battlestar Galactica or Dead of Winter.

I once played a game of this where I was never selected to go on any missions, and all my ideas and opinions were veto'ed. IT SUCKED!

This game is very hit and miss dependent upon who you play it with but has more depth than werewolf or bang and so hits that table more often.

My first experience with Res was a 6 player game that was dull. when I explained that everything you say and do gives out some information, the entire group just clammed up and said NOTHING... we pretty much played the entire game in silence for 30 mins and the spies won 3-1.
So I gave it a 4/10 and left it on the shelf for about a year.
My new group then wanted to give it a try, and we have 4 games back to back with acusation, counter points, banter, joking, more accusations, more double guessing and so on. 4 AWESOME games... 8/10 now, but you have to have a group that GETS the game.

RATING: 7
This game is a riot (apologies for the thematic pun).  As someone whose always enjoyed the "who's the traitor" style of games, especially the far more elaborate Battlestar Galactic, The Resistance fits a niche for me in terms of a short, fast-paced, and accessible traitor themed party game I have been sorely lacking since I used to play Mafia/Werewolf back in my childhood.  While the game seems highly biased towards the spies, I'd be hard pressed to say I never had fun as the losing team.  Additionally, if you are playing with a particularly engaged and creative group of people, dynamically creating a story to each mission, connecting it over time into an overall arch, is incredibly fun, especially if your team's rebellion takes a turn into the absurd.

My only real complaint is that the game cannot be played with four players, as getting five or more can be a bit difficult at times, even with this game's short length.  Otherwise I give it my fullest recommendation.

BGG awards

A party game of deduction and bluffing that reminds me of Werewolf but shorter & with more structure.  

Played with 6 & 7 people, all 3 variations (basic, blind spies, & the "expansion"--which is included with the game.  

This really demands the right crowd.  There has to be a  deceitful atmosphere with lots bantering and communication.  Instead it was just unenthusiastic accusations here & there such as, "oh, so he's the spy."  

We all thought the game was lacking and everyone agreed the mood had to be right.  We couldn't decide which of the variations we liked the least.

For these 3 games it was a flop.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
7/20/10  Played The Resistance twice. Kind of like Battlestar Galactica with all the theme scraped off. Plays very quick.

4/18/11  Finished with 10 player Resistance x2. More fun then I remembered. Probably better with lots of people? #notatgof2011

5/16/11  Played 3 games of the Resistance. We used the plot cards. I think I prefer the game without them, though.

5/23/11  Another play of the Resistance (6p). I was suspected by many but was not a traitor. I'm shocked we pulled out the win.

5/30/11  Ended with the store favorite, The Resistance. Won quickly as a traitor. Especially satisfying to win as the team leader at the end.

7/12/11  Won 2/3 games of Resistance. Correctly ID'd all 3 spies in one game and then played good cop/bad cop with a fellow spy to win in the next.

7/19/11  Resistance: I had to basically reveal I was a spy. It's kind of disturbing how easily my friends bought into the "I'm stupid" defense.

Pro
-Game with traitor element
-Requires logic and deduction to win
-Scales with number of players
-Fairly short game

Con
-Requires the right group
-Weaker than Avalon (the only clues come from semi-boring events and how people react to those as opposed to inherent player abilities)
-Plot cards are uninspired...e.g. someone has to show their approve or disapprove of a group first...who cares?

RATING: 6
Mechanics-wise superior to basic Werewolf - no elimination, no moderator, actual data to go on. The card mechanic is a bit awkward and the data analysis makes my mind boggle.

This is THE perfect deduction game.

PROS:
Bluffing, deduction, lying, back stabbing, paranoia.
Quick to play, easy to teach.
Cheap to purchase and doesn't take up a lot of table space. 

CONS:
The main issue is if a card gets scuffed or bent even slightly, people pick up on it easily and can quickly ruin the game. Not a big deal if you take care of them, but the same cannot be said about your fellow players.

Tried Avalon version for the first time.
My fellow "evil team guys" stated that I played in a deplorable way.
Since I happened to have to impersonate Oberon I thought I'd try to create as much chaos during the game as humanly possible, nominating people out of whimsical reasons and incouraging mischief and miscommunication even amongst my own.
Teammates's reception to my brilliant decision to implement a Stanislavski approach to the Resistance didn't go over as expected.

With the right group, this is a very fun game.  The fear and paranoia you feel when on the resistance and stone-cold lying and scheming required when you're a spy is so much fun.  Anyone that rates this game lower than a "9" is probably not playing with the right people or may themselves not be predisposed to a game like this.

Update: I'm lowering this game to an "8".  I still enjoy this game very much, but have found the game degrades to a screaming match when played with the same group over and over.  However, the game immediately rejuvenates when you bring in new players.

Az első három játék nem alapján nem teljesen állt össze nekem. Alap szabálykkal játszottunk, de nem éreztük, hogy túl sok lenne benne. Ráadássul a kiegyensúlyozottsággal is voltak problémák. Elsőre felkelő a csapatvezető, vagy bárki pont belenyúl egy 1 felkelő / többi jó leosztásba, akkor onnan gyakorlatilag lehetetlen nyerni. Talán az lehetne a megoldás, ha a jók fixen nemmel szavaznának az elején, de persze ezt se lehet így deklaráltan végigcsinálni. Fura, jobbra számítottam. Talán a kieg. kártyák feldobják majd.

A Werewolf-like game that isn't anything like Werewolf.

Instead of random accusations and entirely made-up discussions the card play in The Resistance actually provides a solid basis for selective paranoia. Instead of "I think my neighbour was breathing harder tonight" you get "The mission with just John and Alexa was a success, but we failed when we added Michael to the team so he must be a traitor." It is, of course, still rarely that clear-cut.

That there is no player elimination and the game is shorter than its source of inspiration is the icing on the cake.

Another game of hidden roles and elucidating which team a player is working for. Identified characters are not eliminated from play. Very fun, needs much more play to get to know it better. In some ways more complicated than werewolf, but in others, it is easier to work through the logic. Werewolf requires an extremely quick mind to be most effective. Resistance has less roles and is more spaced out timewise, so you can bide time and sabotage at a later time.

The biggest problems are easily finding a group large enough to play with and familiar enough to do so. This kind of game is highly confrontational, making it excessively unpleasant to play with strangers.
It's a fine game, but the challenge in finding people to play it with is far too limiting.

I love Werewolf and the only dislike I have about Werewolf is the elimination part, so I thought The Resistance might be the ultimate solution. It does have a good solution for the elimination problem, but I still don't like it as much as Werewolf. It is a great game still, but the theme and the lack of variety in roles make it less of an experience to me than Werewolf does.

Also own:
-The Resistance: Avalon: This edition adds the King Arthur theme and a few special roles to the game, which gives it a bit more flavor, I like it.

This is one of the best Party games! If you have a voracious, spontaneous group you're gonna shout yourself hoarse.

Think of it as Battlestar Galactica without the many micro-decisions. It's distrust at its most quint-essential level.

Unfortunately its strength is also its greatest weakness. Players only ever participate in the same way, namely votes and missions. Where Battlestar has a myriad of ways players can get involved, Resistance fairly limits players. It makes the game really accessible to get into and fun, but after so many rounds, I do feel repetition creeping in.

[b][i]The Resistance[/i][/b] is a fun quick lie-to-your friends social deduction game. Everyone goes through the game claiming to be a good guy while a few are actually bad guys lying through their teeth. People vote on a subset of the group to send on a mission and, if sent, bad people will sometimes cause the mission to fail while claiming that they would never have failed that mission. Games sometimes come down to shouting matches, but in a good way. It's the only game where I feel comfortable sitting down with 9 complete strangers and telling one of them (while smiling to remind that it is, after all, only a game) that I think they're a dastardly no-good liar, an evil servant of a totalitarian regime bent on sowing the destruction of all that is good and virtuous. They of course accuse me in kind (probably correctly) and by the end you've hopefully made some new friends.

Because comparisons to Mafia/Werewolf (another lie-to-your friends social game) are nearly inevitable, I'll add that I think The Resistance is superior in every possible way.

[b]Avalon vs Standard:[/b] I think The Resistance: Avalon is better than The Resistance. They both have the same core rules, but Avalon has alternate identities instead of once-a-turn action cards. The one thing I prefer in The Resistance is the dystopian future theme. Still, you cannot go wrong with either.

Amazing party game.  Takes the goodness of Battlestar and speeds it up considerably.  It'll have all your friends yelling at each other, which I see as a good thing.

Update 2 - I'm lowering this a lot. It's hard to explain to new groups, especially compared to simpler fare like One Night games, and Avalon is superior.

Is a nice option to have with bigger groups. It plays up to 10 so when it gets a little unwieldy with group size I can pull this out and have a pretty good chance of the majority of people having fun. Some groups will just want to play over and over and others will be good with just a couple plays. I'm not one that could play it for an extended period of time as I think my max plays in a row stands at 5.

OK light semi-cooperative game. Liked it more than I thought I would. A good opportunity for sly and clever play by the spies.

This one is all about who you are playing with.

This thing went from like a 5 to an 8, a serious climber in rank and it continues to not only be fun but actually more and more enjoyable.

Keys to the game: People you enjoy playing/socializing with, beer, late night gaming at a pub, men in mustaches...He is a spy!

This game is getting old. My group loves it so we keep at it but I'm finding it is getting dull.

Update: at the point with this one where the games are pretty much won or lost based on which cards are drawn, when, and who draws them.

I also added more roles from the Avalon edition of the game and it has made the game much more popular with the people I play with.  I wish they would add these roles to the next edition of the game.  I prefer the theme so I will not buy Avalon.

The Resistance is amazing the first time you play. Then you get good at it, and your friends and you stop having tells and learn how to lie within the game, and it's horrible. The puzzle is impossible to solve as the Resistance. Every game I play now comes down to randomly choosing someone to trust over someone else and hoping I'm right. The shouting is so much less fun the more you play. Avalon like modules can breath more life into it, for sure. But the base game is really just a good intro to social deduction games. If you like it, I'd recommend graduating to something a little meatier quickly.

I found this game to be very much take it or leave it. I've only ever played with the same group of friends so it could come down to that. I've played with 5 players up to 9. The more people the more fun i find this game to be. I've had several games be ruined because other players can't hide tells and are instantly identified as a spy, and I mean instantly, like as soon as everyone opens their eyes. It is definitely a fun game when the players around you play it right but it can be such a poor experience if there are several players in your group that are really bad at keeping a poker face.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game always manages to be fun when you get a good enough amount of people.  It's ok with 5, it's better with 6+.  Definitely worth checking out at least.  If you have a game group of 6+ players, at least 1 person in your group should get this game.  I find it better than Werewolf, but I would say switch to Werewolf when you have more players than The Resistance can handle (more than 10).  Werewolf was made more for large groups anyway.  The Resistance, on the other hand, is made more for the semi-small group of 6-10 players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Once your group has discovered every elemental trick to spot the spies (voting pattern, off aproving, etc), this degenerates in just "reading" people, which is exactly what I don't like in this game. Plus it is nearly impossible to win as resistant if a dumbass, stubborn or illogical player happens to be in your team, while you always have a chance even if a dumbass is a spy in your team. That's why I largely prefer Werewolf; I don't mind player elimination in exchange for a more entertaining experience.
This game requires heavy lecturing on tactics for novice players before playing, besides explaining the rules. And in my experience, it's incredible how stupid some people can be, not understanding why a mission approved by everyone in the table is a mission that's gonna fail, and so on. Not worth the pain sometimes.
Besides, plot cards are a must for the full experience, and at the same time may break the game, so... Not totally sold on this when there are alternatives; I will play it if we are just 7 and in the mood for secret identities.

The Resistance is very clearly inspired by the party/parlor game Werewolf. I don't like Werewolf. At all. In fact, I hate Werewolf with a burning passion. It seems completely pointless to me, because unless the werewolves have miserable poker faces, there really is no information upon which to base your lynching decisions. So the game invariably devolves into a drawn out session of oration and pleading and unprovoked low-level roleplaying.

The Resistance is probably about as good as a game of this genre can be. It has the psychology and bluffing that Werewolf fans will want, along with actual strategy, deduction, finesse, timing, tension, and other desirable game qualities that are so notably missing from Werewolf. The Resistance is still not a game that I would personally request, but I'm happy and willing to play it. And that should be considered a high compliment coming from someone who so utterly detests Werewolf. I may even pick up a copy. It's cheap, and I can foresee circumstances when it would be a nice game to have available.

The consensus seems to be that The Resistance plays best in the 7-10 player range (especially 7).

You MUST have the right group and the right attitude to have FUN when playing this game, otherwise it is just a bore. You have to talk and throw accusations about. This should NOT be a quiet game!

I fell in love with this game if only for the sheer madness it puts you through! Is this person lying? Can I trust them? We? Who's we? Excellent social deduction with enough game thrown in. That said, it needs EVERYONE to be really involved and it also takes a couple of plays to sink in. I almost always mix in Hidden Agenda, but that's not to say the vanilla game doesn's have legs of its own!

So much fun until you get a headache from trying to figure out who is who, who is lying, and who just doesn't know how to play this game very well.
The Resistance is a party game that presents a puzzle to be solved. Who among you are the spies that will ultimately sabotage your efforts to bring down the world-dominating super corporation? It's great fun, and you will be amazed how convincing your supposed best buddy is as he lies to your face about being a nasty, dirty, boot-licking spy. You almost wish they had included a real gun instead of a cardboard tile, because after the game is over and you realize he was lying to you all along, you will want to shoot him in the face.
I love hidden identity games. Werewolf, Mafia, Masquerade - all are great fun, and dependent upon the crowd you're playing with. But the puzzle behind The Resistance becomes frustrating because it's not a puzzle you can solve. After several plays, you begin to realize it's an exercise in frustration, and you will get frustrated. There are cards to introduce that will help one side have an advantage over the other, but those cards demonstrate how broken the puzzle is in the first place. 
I still love it, and it's a great way to get people interested in these types of games, but if you're going to introduce new players to it, sit yourself out and just facilitate the game until they get it. Then sit back and watch the sparks fly.
Oh, and make sure no one has a loaded weapon.

I really don't like this game. Party games for gamers never do it for me. On top of that the graphics for the yes/no cards are unclear and that little card thingy which tells you how the "teams" are doing looks very lost on a table with 7 people around. Of all the games I have played over the last year this is the last one I would want to play again. Others around the table seemed to be ok with it, I just wanted to get on with something meaty and strategic. Nov 2011

Finally got to play this one. Very hard to be the Imperial Agent in this one. Very hard. 

I rate this game only a "6" for now, I had higher expectations.

But I understand this to be unjust, as we may haven't played right. Next plays will tell if the rating will increase.

I finally got to play it right. This game rocks! 
I want it, and I recommend it!

Played it again recently, as always great experience. Perfect party game!

Fun, though with one group the sense of paranoia actually started to creep us out.

UPDATE 3/3/13
Dropped rating. I still own it, but this one only gives an illusion of being more "solvable" than something like werewolf. In the end, you're still just reading people, which is fun, but using confusing semaphore cards to express yourself instead of just calling the villain out is a drag when you accidentally mix them up.

RATING: 9
Just great, unless you hate bluffing. A much tighter version of Werewolf, playable by as few as five. Very simple to play (you can get by without using several of the already few components), but with great depth provided by the player interaction.

Update: it's probably been fired by One Night Werewolf. I need to give the Avalon variant a try some time, if I can find a group where someone doesn't veto it (being interrogated isn't for everyone).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Our group's favourite Mafia variant, partly because it allows us to play with less than nine people, but mostly because it provides all the intense loyalty mechanics without any of the elimination. Easily learned, always engaging, and surprisingly well-balanced. The only issue we have ever had was with the rule for round 4 which states that the Spies need to insert two mission fails instead of one. This is supposedly supposed to make games easier for the Terrorists, and thus more balanced, but we have a win-rate of nearly 50% for either team -without- using the rule, so we usually remove it. New players who are familiar with Mafia will often question this choice if anybody is silly enough to actually bring it up, and it has consistently been the only mechanics disagreement to trip us up in this game.


We also have a lot of fun with descriptors, since the "Good Guys" are "Terrorists".

As with One Night Ultimate Werewolf, I could imagine this being fun with an experienced group who mostly based their suspicions on in-game factors.

Pulled off a decisive victory for the spies and it was amazingly tense and satisfying.  Turns out i like this game more with 5 players than 9, but I'm wondering if there's a sweet spot.  Probably just need to check the forums.

Not surprisingly, 7 is voted "best" and I could imagine that with a 3-4 ratio, the game would shine.

My most recent experiment was to try to playing this first without speaking, then without speaking or eye contact.  We did this because the deception was weighing too heavily on some players' shoulders and it was still an interesting experiment.  Not nearly as fun though.

Holy crap, this game has made for some EPIC game nights. When we are looking for a party game with larger groups I always reach for this.  Gamers and non gamers alike seem to love this game, and if you enter alcohol into the equation the game gets even crazier. The game scales very well from 5-9 players.  

Note: We played a "Silent" game a few weeks back which was amazing.  Basically no one can speak, only gesture and vote.  This forces you to rely on reading physical signs only.  You would be surprised how quickly you figure out who the spies are when mis-information isn't flying around. I highly recommend trying this as an alt house rule. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Play it in a group, with at least 2 paranoid people, that increases the fun. All players must go in for it and really want to draw conclusions based on voting, body language and reasoning who is a spy and who's not. Great fun for such a simple game.

Only issues I have is that you need at least 5 people. But I and my friend found that 9 people, that is the sweet spot. However, such a large group is quite often a problem to find (a group that has good chemistry). And even a total of 7 people might be difficult to find (which I recommend as the lowest number of players).

It modernizes the old "Werewolf" party game, getting rid of player elimination and the need for a moderator. It's quick and harmless, but it still feels more like an activity than a game. I have only played it once, but it seems to be imbalanced in favor of the spies.

One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It's different every game. The mind games that the spies play on the resistance are the main part of this game. It really gets your adrenaline pumping when you're down to the last mission, and you're sure of everyone but two. One is a spy and the other a resistance member, but you don't know which is which, and making the wrong choice can cost you the game. It's very intense, especially with more people. I recommend this game to anyone. The only downside, is that it requires at least 5 people, and some groups may not have that people available to play with. Other than that, 10 out of 10.

I never wanted to play this game, as I can't stand Werewolf much, but well, shit happens. :O

Anyhow, I must admit that this game is ok, even for me. Still nothing I would ask for, but there are worse games out there.

I think those who like this style of games should try it and people like me, who don't like this stuff won't miss anything.

Best team deduction game ever. So much to say about this guy but I think you should discover it on your own. Give it multiple plays and know that it's going to be difficult at first. This is not your common mafia or werewolf were complete-hard information is given. You've gotta learn to bluff and learn to read faces. Just don't be that guy who gets mad during this game, just a game people. Worth every penny and it gives you a reason to work on your lying skills... For gaming purposes only. Top 10 of all time for me

With the Hostile Intent expansion, this is better than Avalon (as well as equipping you with all the Avalaon roles).

For most of the game, your only mechanical choices are "Yes/No". From that, it builds an outstandingly complex social game, providing just enough mechanical prompts and information to make the game work, and then getting out of the way and letting the social side take over. Amazing. One of the most important recent designs.

Good game as long as you don't expect it to be purely about deduction. It's not - it's as much about psychology, bluffing and having a poker face as anything else. If players aren't prepared to get into the spirit of it then it falls flat. If they don't mind pointing fingers and making wild accusations then it's great fun.

Short and sharp. Plenty of scope for my improvement to improve as I get to understand it more. Just 15/20 minutes for a game though is great.

With repeated plays it actually feels that it's not as clever as it likes to think it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a simple game of deceit. The instructions are straightforward and players are able to grasp the concepts of the game within minutes.

While the spies win a majority of the time, the game is always entertaining. It's funny to hear people's theories on the spy agenda, only to have them disproved at the end of the game. It's even more entertaining when that theory is correct and the spies somehow manipulate it to suit their purposes.

The game boils down to logic, but often times it turns into a screaming match when the spies circumvent any intelligent discussion with allegations of their own. This, however, never seems detract from the fun!

I prefer the avalon character game play over the resistance plot cards. But I prefer the resistance theme so I bought the resistance and just designate the character card in avalon to the resistance characters. That way I can have the best of both worlds. We play this game quite often and its always fun.

RATING: 10
This game is easily "best in class" for hidden role games.

The interactions are every bit as good as Werewolf, but has the added benefit that no moderator is needed, and there is no elimination ([i]anyone else hate getting killed on the first night?[/i]).  Also, there is more public [i]partial[/i] information in this game, resulting in involving more people in deductive logic.  Fantastic game for a group -- definitely a favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One game, we figured out who the traitors were in the second round, then proceeded to force a win.  The special ability cards and simplified system just aren't designed for veteran BSG players who know how to read actions.  Overall I don't think it is a bad game, and I would play again if asked.  It just isn't something I'm interested in buying, because there isn't a lot of meat on the bones.  I want to play again to see if maybe there is something I missed.

I love this game. I love social deduction games, and this is ideal. It doesn't take too long, and feels very fluid. Streamlined and simple but the way the game progresses is going to bring different interesting decisions for each player depending on perspective. This is one of the most natural genres for me to fit into as persuasion is key as is the ability to set yourself quickly to the fresh logic of the situation. You'll get caught out if you set yourself to one way of thinking or playing.

RATING: 10
This is an excellent game with all the fun of Mafia/Werewolf in a much shorter timeframe. Playing this game made me remove Ultimate Werewolf from my wishlist. There's just no need to ever play it again when this game exists. It's not simply that it is more streamlined either though, it creates opportunities for bluffs and the like that I haven't seen in any other game of this type. The Plot Cards are where this game really shines, creating opportunities for the losing team to still pull out a win right to the bitter end.

Party and social-deduction games are not my bag. But Resistance is the best of the few I own or play. For me, what makes it superior are the multiple phases of choice/deduction: the selection of mission-members, the vote for mission go-ahead, then determining the success/failure of the mission. (Also hard to not like a game that plays up to 10.)

A better werewolf that works with 5.  The theme is not as good as werewolf, but The Resistance is the better game.
In fact it is the best game involving traitors, way better than Battlestar Galactica (focusing on the traitor aspect and a short playing time) or Bang (your actions decide the outcome, not the cards, and there is no player elimination) or werewolf (there are facts besides psychological aspects to base your decision upon).

Sweet spot is probably between 6 and 8 players.  With 10, it can be very difficult to figure out who the double agents are...

RATING: 4
I certainly can't deny how well this game takes the lengthier formula provided by the oh so popular and well-known Werewolf and trims it down. However, it still boils down to social deduction (if that's your thing, then this is likely to be a game for you).

Not to raise my nose, I prefer having far more nuanced, complex, and achored social interactions in gaming such as those provided in games such as Santiago, Genoa, or even Bohnhanza.

It's a reasonably good party/social game like Werewolf. I'm terrible at this kind of thing though. For some reason people never trust me, and I'm often not eloquent enough to state a reasonable case for myself. Opponents also tend to paint my mistakes as deliberate trouble-making. Meanwhile the guy silently brooding in the corner gets away with murder. Guess I should just learn to keep my trap shut. Anyway, this has the bonus of being much shorter than Werewolf, about 20 minutes per game. I'd be willing to play it every once in a while, but I found I liked the less free-form Castle of the Devil more.

This one was a huge hit playing it with the family at Thanksgiving this year. I told the nieces and nephews that it was the only time they could lie to their parents and not get into trouble! Such fun! The accusations flying, denials, guilty looks even when innocent. Fantastic! The only thing I might add is a little story for each mission, but that might get old quick and it wouldn't make the game play any better. This one plays quick and is easy to teach.
I think the spies would have a very hard time in a 5 player game though.

Playing with a young friend's copy (a Christmas gift to him last year), we had (3) enjoyable rounds of The Resistance (w/5 players), the streamlined Mafia/Werewolf game which takes the contest to a quick and tasty focus.

Playing a character is more than half the fun here, and the mind games is where the game is- the logic, the people-reading, the play and the bluster.

One loss (as a loyal Resister), followed by two wins, one loyal, and one as a spy.

A nice, fairly quick, involving game, with lots of play value. An excellent little game that easily lived up to it's reputation.

A great game involving hidden roles, deduction and deception. Easy to explain and play. The card boards used in the game are marked according to the number of players and this is great because they have all the information for the game so you don't have to check the rules each game for: number of spies according to the number of players or number of players for each mission.

Un excelente juego de roles ocultos, deducción y engaño. Fácil de explicar y de jugar. Los tableros que se usan están diseñados acorde al número de jugadores, ésto está genial porque el tablero tiene toda la información necesaria y no es necesario buscar en las instrucciones ¿cuántos espías serán? o ¿cuántos jugadores van a cada misión?

Over time I have grown to dislike Resistance. I need more actual "game" in my game, whereas this usually degenerates into a big argument/discussion.

Edit: Dec2016 - Put more succinctly, the game does not offer the players enough information to "solve" the puzzle. Therefore, the last couple rounds end up with everybody shouting at one another with no real way to actually figure out who the spies are unless players are terrible liars.

Didn't like this one. You have nothing to do on your turn other than argue, and there's very little thematic immersion to 'get into character'. Unlike BSG where you have a definite role, abilities, and several different things to do, this one lets you just pick people for a vote and vote twice. It's not interesting. It's also very scripted if you're not into this kind of negotiation game because you end up with no choices or decisions to make, because groupthink has already said 'if you do this, then you're that' so you have to basically either do it or not if you're not inclined to stand up and argue your position. Very dull. I'm not a natural liar, and without a good RP sheen like BSG, this feels much too direct for me. There might as well not be a game in there at all. Now, I admit, if you're into negotiation and enjoy flat out argument and deception, then you're away. For me, BSG scratches those itches in a much more interesting format with a much richer experience built around it. I'm also happy with Shadow Hunters doing something similar, because again there are things you can do and a variety of situations. This is a very tedious game system, and quite honestly you could play it with scraps of paper - you don't need to buy anything to play it. The group likes it, though.

A brilliant deduction game for gamers and non-gamers alike, playing up to 10 people!  Pull it out at any party.  

Something worth considering: I used to think it was pretty much the perfect filler with larger groups, until a friend of mine expressed his dislike.  I asked why, and he claimed that it reminded him of being "the last one picked for football" because of the way it encourages players to be loud and argumentative, and even to pick on one another.  I hadn't considered this and it seems to be a very fair point.  I even have another friend who will simply refuse to play any game which requires "negotiation".

Still, I love it.

Got a lot of playtime when I first picked it up. It was the perfect party game for large numbers. But I started noticing some flaws in each play. Namely, the reliance on meta gaming and choices that didn't matter. Resistance almost represents an entire genre of gaming that, once you've experienced it, you know exactly what to expect.

So far this is my favorite Social Deduction game.  I have played Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, but only once and that might take the cake eventually, but for now its Resistance.  I like it better than other others I have including Coup, Mafia: Vendetta, Spyfall and One Night Ultimate Warewolf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting, complex and in my mind, even better than its first cousin, Werewolf.  Why? because it forces deduction over rhetoric. There are many hints and clues given to help deduction in this game.  Team selection, mission results, and some of the rules will help narrow down the choices.  I like this one.

I suck at this game because I can't lie.  Anyway, it's *kind of* fun for me to play but even more fun to watch & moderate.  I'll keep it for playing with casual groups, especially when there's lots of players.  This really isn't my type of game but it's amazing to watch people who are good at it.

A truly amazing game of bluffing and talking. Takes the perfect amount of time to play, and never fails to get a feeling of suspense around the table. However, my one woe is that being on the Resistance isn't as exciting or interesting as being a Spy, and I always end up on the Resistance. This one thing makes it boring multiple times in a row. Perhaps Avalon adds something with its specific roles though.

RATING: 5
I'm a fan of hidden identity games but this is too plain. It's more like a simple logic puzzle than a game. Always just boils down to "you're the spy" vs "no you're the spy" arguments. The problem is there is nothing concrete to go on like there is in better games like BSG so it ends up being totally random unless someone makes a mistake.

It's barely even a game, and certainly not "BSG lite" since there is no context to all the accusations and it's too much of a guessing game. "Werewolf lite" would be much more accurate.

In fairness, it's better with some different roles, and Avalon is a huge improvement.

RATING: 6
"ARE YOU A SPY!" Which is the the most common phrase uttered during this game.

Great little party game that always gets people laughing. There are two teams: The Resistance (blue) and the Spies (red). These factions are dealt out at random to the players. Once everyone knows who they are, everyone closes their eyes and only the spies open their eyes to see who is on their team. There are five missions per game. The objective of the blue team is to win 3 out of 5. For the spies, it's to sabotage 3 out of 5.

The start player chooses which people go on a mission, depending what the mission parameters are. If you are a blue, you must vote for the success of the mission. If you are a spy, you MAY vote for the success or failure. This is done with cards that are handed to the start player who then shuffles them up (keeping who put what in secret).

This game is a blast on just puts you on the edge of your seat. Although, you can only play so many games before you stop caring. Never do more than two consecutive.

RATING: 8.5
This game has been SO FUN every time we've played, though it is a bit of a chore to explain the rules. Its like werewolf/mafia but without player elimination so everyone gets to play the whole game which is a plus. 

Only gripe is that it seems unbalanced. It seems way too hard for the Resistance to win. The Spies bluff and double bluff and its basically impossible to figure out who is who after that. Regardless its still heaps of fun even if the resistance never/hardly wins! :) Its the journey not the destination that counts :)

Am i supposed to judge this solely on the base game? If so it's a clear 5. With Hidden agenda (aka Resistance: Avalon) this game becomes a 7.5.

RATING: 5
Works reasonably well as a stripped-down Mafia clone that can be played in less than 30 minutes.  This game really comes down to how serious the players are - if finding the traitors is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, you will probably have a good time.  After a few plays, however, it does seem like the game is weighted hopelessly against the resistance - there is just not enough information gained on each mission and too few acceptable failures for the resistance to figure out who all the traitors are.

There's not much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said several times over. I'm giving it a 9 instead of 10 because it won't appeal so much to people who are uncomfortable with flat-out lying to their friends. It's a fantastic game, but it's not quite for everyone.

RATING: 10
Close to being the perfect game for the group I regularly play with. Shifting group dynamics, developing patterns of play over time, and the birth of the term 'rat' for any hidden traitor in any game...  There's a lot to love.

Like: How satisfying the game feels on both sides, either through successful deduction or convincing deception. With the mechanics of the game being quite simple, the social element is what makes the largest part of the game, and there's a lot of scope for creativity in play style on both sides. Coordinating with your team, known or unknown, can be challenging but satisfying. Getting a read on people (and successfully convincing other people), or giving people the wrong read on you, feels very rewarding.

Dislike: Due to playing it so much, it can be hard to introduce a newer player to the game despite it being a pretty simple game - sometimes it's them not grasping simple rules, sometimes it's them not grasping the subtlety of play (accepting/rejecting missions in particular). Players not quite being mindful of the team they're on can be costly, particularly a good player who is warned they're acting ratty and persists with it. The occasional instance of the good team lucking into correct selections quickly isn't great, but is unavoidable now and then.

If you are a person that usually does not like social deduction games, you might want to try this game before you dismiss it.  This game succeeds where so many other games fail.  There is no player elimination, no need for constant shutting of eyes, the voting is simple and quick and very organized.  The best part for me is that the game is extremely balanced.  When I first played I was worried that with varying numbers of people that one side would have the advantage.  To my surprise and delight, regardless of the number of people I have seen both sides win consistently.

Aug10:

I do not like:
Werewolf/Mafia
Bang
Shadow Hunters
etc.

And yet this is a game I can get behind.  Why?

Because you have partial information dammit!  Shadow Hunters did that somewhat too, but the rules overhead was way too much.  The Resistance is nice and simple to understand.

And yet the implications of the game can run so dang deep.

Instead of blind accusations you all start jumping through logic puzzles of "if this then that BUT"!

It's quite the enjoyable player interaction.

This is a fun game, but one that depends a lot on your gaming group. I have only played with my family (wife and 4 kids 6 - 11 years old). Right now, when we play it is easy to win as the resistance because the spys are spotted really easy in the game; but like I said, it really depends on who is playing. I think the rating could go up in the future as I get to play more games with other people. The game is easy, and I feel like it is one that I can introduce to most people at a party or family get together. Still, between this and Ultimate Werewolf, I would choose Werewolf.
UPDATE: I just have no interest in this game anymore.

RATING: 8
This one was a slow burn. The first few times I played it, it really fell flat. I'm not sure if it was the group dynamic, or a few bad eggs spoiling the fun, but I was really beginning to wonder why it gets the love it does, and chalking it up as an inexpensive shot in the dark that didn't pan out. 

...then we tried it again, and it was good. Then again, and it was even better. Then again, and again, and again, and the game just kept improving with every single play. It's a marvelously simple and incredibly tense game. The whole game is entirely social and political: is one able to read other people and keep from being read? Is one able to convince others of one's intentions, or conversely fool them into trust?

I really appreciate how distilled of a game experience it is. No roles. No host. No bits. Just a simple question: who can you trust? This game absolutely murders Werewolf for me, and has definitely become a group favorite. It gets a ton of play, and I'm happy to bring it out at any gathering. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yes, it's better than Werewolf. But it has many of the same problems, including hearing and making the same arguments over and over again.

Fun social game, although can be very confusing the first few times if you are teaching it to your group and yourself.  The first session with this game, we ended up playing 3 times despite not fully grasping it.  The most table talk I've had during a game, as this game basically necessitates it naturally.  I didn't expect being a spy to be as thrilling as it was when it happened to me.  The more you know your group, the better this game will be.

Can work with the right people when you can let go.

Otherwise it's just hunches and guessing unless the spies play badly.

Wow, clearly better than I expected.
I was afraid of simple rules, but they _really_ work and give a solid ground for _real_ deduction, posing accusations and lively discussions :)

I've confirmed: the more people, the better.  The difference between 5 and 8-10 players is much bigger than I had imagined.

It's better than Werewolf, but you to need to have  proper company to enjoy this.  Just like in Werewolf case...
I see no such company (regular at least) in my pool of co-players so my desire to play Resistance is lowered to 6.5...

Very good game built off Werewolf with the secret voting mechanic from BSG thrown in.  The nice thing here is it plays well even with 5 (better with more), no elimination AND you do not need a moderator.  Everything else is more or less the same as WW with great bluffing elements, psychology at work and lots of accusations.  Somewhat more info here though especially with special abilities too so you potentially have [i]something[/i] to build accusations off of.  

Curious to see the produced version and what new cards will be included (hopefully some good options) and if they help balance the game more to the resistance a little.  Very fun game as is WW and worth owning even if you already have WW for the differences mentioned and most likely goodies coming in the produced package.  

Rating could go up once I play the produced version

Not for me - a game where lying and betrayal are the core mechanic. Oh yeah - great idea NOT. 

I can not suspend my personal integrity to play such tosh. At the last count there were thousands of better games. 

Either you can fool some of the people all the time or maybe, at their core, the majority of people enjoy lying, cheating and preventing things (missions/operation in this case) being successful?

This is a social deduction game and I'm not a big fan of them but it's not bad for what it is.  The players each get a secret loyalty card.  Most of them are members of the underground (sci-fi theme) while a few are spies.  Each round one person is the team leader and picks a team for a mission.  Everyone votes whether to accept the team.  Then the team puts in secret mission cards that are then shuffled.  Each card either indicates success or failure.  The mission only succeeds if all are successes.  If a spy has secretly sabotaged it everyone starts trying to guess who it was to keep them from being on the next mission leading to much kerfuffle.  The resistance has to win a certain number of missions to (say 3 of 5) otherwise the spies win.  To make it more fun, we had a house rule that before team leader dramatically flipped each mission card s/he would make up what the mission was about and what each step was (e.g., unleashing killer clowns on the Evil Regime so first step is recruit clowns, then equip them with laser flowers, etc) to make a story of it.  Overall fun.  More a party game.  I prefer Secret Hitler or One Night Werewolf as they have more interesting things going on.

RATING: 5
What makes a good bluffing game for me is when a player has to back up any table talk with in-game actions. I want to like The Resistance, but it is just a little too free-form for me to enjoy it. It is difficult to actually get information about who is bluffing and who is telling the truth because so little actual gameplay takes place. And the cost of information is too high - by the time a player starts revealing enough information to demonstrate loyalty to one side or the other, the outcome is almost determined.

I understand this game's popularity - it's easy to teach and supports a large group - but there are so many other great bluffing games that I'd rather play than The Resistance, a game that mostly involves sitting at a table and arguing with people about intentions rather than interpreting actions.

RATING: 10
Ah, The Resistance. My favorite game.

We've had some amazingly good times. We've had some dramatically bad times. There have been ups and there have been plenty of downs. We've had people storm out of the room, cursing, declaring they would never play the game again. We've had people sit and look at their phone the entire game. I've had some of my favorite gaming memories, staring into my friends' eyes, trying to read there every movement and breath. This game has created friendships, torn them apart, and rebuilt them. Resistance is more than a game to us. Resistance is the foundation that has brought us together.

But, alas, no matter how many times we say that we're completely DONE with Resistance, we always come back for more. We just can't stay away. I would like to say a very warm thank you to Resistance for providing numerous hours of enjoyment to my gaming group.

Oh how I have laughed, cried, and enjoyed the hell out of this game.  The kicker? You feel the whole gamut of emotions as a group.

Bluffing, intrigue, and straight up lying all make for those grand gameplays that will keep you talking about it for years.

RATING: 8
Mostly the same game as Resistance: Avalon, but the event cards, which give temporary, public special abilities or restrictions to certain players, seem to play a bit better than the static roles from Avalon because nobody is stuck playing Merlin or some other role the whole game despite not wanting to or knowing how.

I think Arthurian Britain is cooler than generic cyberpunk though.

I was initially very skeptical about this game, but it works very well where Werewolf breaks down:  it forces interaction and discussion among any group of players by presenting itself in a manner where everyone's motives are clearcut.

Compare to Are You the Traitor, which results in people like me sitting there, totally speechless and not caring as to what happens, The Resistance effectively involves everyone from the start.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (October 2010)

I love hidden roles games and The Resistance plays so quick it is a winner in my book. The game is pretty fun to play. It has similar, but improved, mechanics than its parent game Werewolf. 1. In The Resistance the votes are secret. 2. There is no player elimination. 3. You don’t need a storyteller which I hate to be in Werewolf.

Very easy to teach, great to introduce new people to the hobby.

Perhaps my only concern is that it appears that winning the game is a lot harder for the resistance, still win or lose we always have a blast playing this so it is a very minnor issue for me

Now I have more plays of The Resistance under my belt, I still enjoy it tremendously and I would love to play it more often, it appears I was correct in my previous assessment and The Resistance loses more often than not. Except for a huge mistake from the empire players you can never be sure who are they (unless you are one of them obviously :devil:) and that worries me a little because if the empire plays perfectly there is no way for them to lose. I have to say I have played with the Plot Cards twice (so I don’t know for sure if they address this issue or not) and I hope they offer a solution to my dilemma BUT even if it is not the case I still will continue to play the game, it is just too fun to pass. 

I love how this game allows me to manipulate the situation to my advantage. Great game.

Last Saturday I played The Resistance: Avalon and I really liked it. If you are new to The Resistance, Avalon is the edition you need to get, as it is exactly the same as the Resistance base game BUT it has some variants that make the game a lot better.

If you already own The Resistance, you can easily play the Avalon variant version making little changes so I cannot justify buying both editions. (Although perhaps I will anyway :D).

I like more The Resistance theme (dystopian future) than the Avalon one (fantasy setting).

I ended up buying The Resistance: Avalon :D. I LOVE this game. When we are playing with new gamers, I usually play vanilla Resistance, but if we are playing in an experienced group, we usually play the Avalon edition. I still haven’t played much with the Plot cards, that is my next goal. 

The Resistance is still a great game (but Avalon is a bit better) so I’m downgrading its rating a bit to reflect this. I won’t ever say no to a Resistance game though.

Also, I prefer the first Resistance edition than the second one, mainly because the 1st edition is much more portable in a deck box AND the chips from the second one peel off easily. You can also read my comments for the second edition under my profile.

This comment is for the Second Edition of the game.

2012-11-27

Initial Rating: 8.5 (November 2012)

I think this is a great game. The only difference between the editions are the components. In the second edition the components are updated and they are really nice, you now have a “board” for each number of players and more tokens, tokens for voting, tokens to choose your team, tokens to track the round and the numbers of disagreements in the current round. All of these is nice to have but not really necessary. 

On the bad side, this box is bigger than the one of the first edition, making it a little harder to travel with it.

Bottom line, I don’t feel any compulsion of getting the second edition if I already own the first edition. But if you are a first comer to The Resistance this is the way to go.

Incredible game - my gaming group would not stop playing this -- we played over and over again for an entire weekend and every game was tons of fun, provided a huge amount of laughs, and left us wanting to start up again. At its core the Resistance was a game of bluffing, player reading and psychology. It was fun to see how players behaved different when they were a member of the resistance versus their behavior when they were trying to sabotage the group. Adding in the plot thicken cards slightly reduces reliance placed on the psychological/player reading nature of the game and I recommend putting them in. Seeing two players confront one another after one has looked at their allegiance card and still not knowing which one is telling the truth was an incredible experience!

You don't need my recommendation.  Just take everyone else's.

After nearly thirty plays I find myself not growing tired of the game but wishing I also had the Avalon variant to change things up a bit.  I still love Resistance just as much but it would be nice to have some other options.

UPDATE: Over it.  I can play this game forever.  The new kickstarter expansions should really help.

The Resistance is a 'social' game, where most of the game is spent talking or not talking. The game is similar to Werewolf where players are given roles secretly and then sent on missions to bring down the corrupt government. Players on the Resistance are trying to send only loyal rebels on these missions, while preventing the Spies from joining in on the fun. The Spies seek to sabotage the missions by deflating the excitement of the Resistance members through sabotage, miscommunication, and general all-around dickery.

One 'thing' about The Resistance however, is the fact that the meta game will decide most games before it even begins. Players who were previously Spies will be accused of being Spies in another game simply because they were Spies in a previous game and their behaviour did not change.

The Resistance is a good game that plays well in larger groups. The social aspect may deter some from enjoying the game as they may not be used to lying, cheating and deceiving other people to get what they want. For those who eat, live and breathe deception, The Resistance is gold.

Update Dec 2011: 25 plays in and it's wearing thin. Still good, but feels repetitive and a lot less fun than it used to. 'You're a spy!' 'No, you're a spy!'
------------
No, not The Muse album, my new favourite game.

How come something this quick and simple can be this good? I thought Werewolf and Saboteur were ace, but this takes the 'hidden mole' game to a new level.

I asked Robert to show me how it played towards the end of York's Beyond Monopoly club session yesterday and we pulled in a few others for a quick game. 3 hours and many missed trains later, we stopped playing it after over a dozen games, while all the time the number of players grew attracted by the good time we were clearly having!

The base game with 5 or 6 easily merits a 10, but I'd mark down the 'Plot Thickens' cards used to balance the game with larger groups as: 1. they slow down the game flow, and 2: they balance the game by giving the resistance team some lucky pot-shots at identifying the spies. In our last game the spies lost purely on one of the 'Plot Thickens' cards giving the resistance a 100% chance of identifying the remaining spy on the last turn.

But that's a minor blot. If you like social games, enjoy bluffing and deduction, and have active senses of drama and humour, this one's a winner.

a hidden traitor game with very little information. the game takes 5 turns in which a player may hand out 3 markers to indicate who they think is on their team, as it boasts up to 10 players, this is my biggest issue with the game. Up to 50% of your players will not be involved in the game. This is one of the worst games i've ever played and it's only saving grace is its short play time.

The resistance takes the game Werewolf and makes it fun for the whole group. No physical player elimination, tons of strategy, and a good way to learn about your friends.

With five players, we were able to figure out who was the problem midway through each game and it became less enjoyable as a result.

PLUS: involves all players, no experience necessary
MINUS: an okay party game that really doesn't push towards more games being played

RATING: 6.2
I have played this game a lot. With the right group, it becomes an overly-deep analysis of people, their reactions, voting patterns. This gives you a lot to work with, even without the in-built expansion.

As of yet, I prefer the base game to the expansion, Avalon, or any other rules twist. Personally, I think Avalon turns the game from the fun of Werewolf social deduction to the dryness of Poker.

I for one highly recommend this game, and look forward to many more plays.

Why I need to re-rate this: Okay, it's about a 6.9 but I want to give it a chance with the expansion

Accusing everyone for being liars for 20-30 mins and then you loose.

RATING: 8
Interesting social deduction game, which is not overly long (due to limited rounds) and can get pretty involved if people start analyzing things. But this can only happen after a few games under the players' belts, as at first you do not try to strategize during your choices (too much). And the game experience also depends on the group itself - whether the players like to throw (sometimes outrageous) accusations around, or only play it mechanically. In the latter case it would be pretty boring. In the former - way to go! Have yet to try it myself, but will definitely bring it to a future game session.

RATING: 10
For me to give a game a "10" is rare. 10 means I will always be willing to play it over anything else, besides another 10. This one is one of my favorites.

This is a straightforward bluffing/deduction/hidden traitors game that has a few things in common with the werewolf/mafia party games you can play with a pen and paper. What I prefer about this version is there is no player elimination, so nobody is left sitting waiting for 20 minutes like can happen in werewolf or mafia.

By far the favorite in my gaming group. We come back to this one again and again. After several playthroughs with the same group, the expansions become necessary, but add enough novelty to keep it going. Different combinations of different expansions also yield very different games.

I will also say that my gaming group is a loose collective of people, and different nights will have different attendance. This game has proven time and again to be the best way to acquaint strangers for the evening. Several times I have invited say a new friend from my job, and they begin the evening quiet and shy, but ten minutes into a game of Resistance they are totally comfortable pointing a finger at their new fellow gamers and shouting "spy!" It's a great time.

One caveat: this game is NOT for quiet or shy types. Introverts will likely feel pressured and/or just plain hate the experience. It requires a great deal of discussion and interaction - and if you're a spy - acting.

Good traitor game, but the formality of it reduces the fun compared to Werewolf.  This sort of game you can play two ways:  either like Werewolf, as a fun romp; or as a true deduction game.  The problem is that its only fun if everyone playing is of the same mindset on which of the two ways to play, and that just doesn't happen.  I don't have a preference for either - both can be fun - but if one person wants to play it as a romp and others as a deduction (or vice-versa) then it just does not work.

I haven't played Bang! or Warewolf, but I thought The Resistance was really fun with 8 players. It seems hard to win on the resistance side. Maybe it's easier when playing against people you know well. The optional rules should make things more interesting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Oh yeah. A great way to end an evening of gaming, especially with the perfect combination of people. I find being a resistance member is not nearly as interesting as being a spy since I can bluff my way through anything, and bluffing is only really a good approach if you are a spy.
Can see why this would fail if played with just the wrong kind of people since a huge part of the enjoyment comes from not the core mechanics of the game but from the (to coin an atrocious Latinism) extraludal interactions.

RATING: 10
BSG after being boiled down to its essence.  Was fun the one time I played it and was totally thrown by a tricksy spy.  

from a geeklist after game night 6/12/2011: 
i checked my collection just now to make sure i had resistance at 10.  then i considered downgrading another of my tens to show props to the big R, but did not (b/c i only have two other 10s).  

i understand why there's been some backlash in our group against it recently, but here's why i think this game is probably most mostest favorite of all right now: 
* [b]it's always different, and always in fucked up challenging new ways.[/b]  i feel like every game i have to ask someone to read me back his logic on a particular call 2x b/c i'm sure there's a point there, it's unfamiliar to me, and i want to get it.  then i have to figure out if i'm just missing the point or if tom is F'ing with me b/c he's a desperate spy or if he's trying to signal me as a chill morpheus or if he's just being sleepy-drunk.  

*  [b]it's the game we play that's most about interacting with each other.[/b]  Can there be any doubt?  we joke and talk quite a bit during our JASE games too, but this game is about the social, and i think any game group could use more of that.  and that's what will always make this game refreshing in a 12 hour gamenight.

*  [b]the game is great at giving you a bunch of info, very little of it clean.[/b]  and the info you have that IS clean is usually clean only for you and not for anyone else.  i think the power has clearly swung blue for us as we've gotten better, but i think that's due for a shift b/c of this information gap.  i personally will be going to a 5 day seminar this week in order to improve my skills as spy. 

okay, i was just thinking on last night's games and wanted to toss some praise where it's due.  there are downsides, including a) some player's uncomfortable experiences with playing roles, b) it feels really unfriendly when we bring in new players or inexperienced gamers (joe's boss and husband, ed, eli's lady friend) b/c they don't know what's going on and they eventually just want it all to end, c) the feeling that a 7+ player game is being dominated by only a few.  

that said, F that, this game is the shit!  which is why 4 weeks from last night the game night at my house will consist of 12 hours of resistance mwahahhahahhaah (not intended as a factual statement).

A very good party game. Best version of a mob/werewolf type game, by far. Just make sure you play with friends who can let it go when the game is over. 
And if you are playing late and night and kids are sleeping? Try playing without talking. It's surprisingly fun to limit all communication to body language.
Edit: Avalon is now the go-to game.

Have only played this game with 5 players so far and really enjoyed it.  I have heard the game plays better with 7 or 8 so I would be keen to try it out at that player count.  Regardless, really enjoyed the game even with 5.

dropped the rating a bit 9->6. I've really come to dread this game when we play it. If I'm not playing the red team then I'm not enjoying myself. While I do get involved and play the game, I find it draining and unsatisfactory when we're done. It's not fun to me, more annoying. It's been a long time since I've played mafia/werewolf, so maybe the resistance-style iteration is just growing old for me and I need some rejuvenation.

Just a spectacular game. Tight and engaging while also being easy to learn and teach. Best part being that so much of the game is played “above the table” reading your friends or lying to their faces. It’s not for everyone. Certainly, conflict or deception averse players need not apply. But I have just never had a game blow people’s minds the way the first couple turns of their first game of this does. Note: if you don’t mind an Arthurian Fantasy theme, Avalon has everything here plus the AMAZING Merlin/Assassin variant (though, honestly, it’s pretty easy to house rule that into The Resistance and it was officially released in an expansion).

RATING: 6
The Resistance just adds enough elements to Werewolf to give a few hints for deducting the secret roles from gameplay itself and not only from the metagame between the players which can sink Werewolf easily if the majority of players are calm. It's still easier to hide your spy identity when you stay out of most discussions but now others will have some specific evidence to tackle those kind of players. Luckily, it avoids Battlestar Galactica's chrome and length overkill and stays within 15-30 minutes playtime making it a good opener or closer for game nights. Now, I just have to learn how to play a traitor without being discovered each time.

27 July 13 Loving this game. We always play with the plot cards as they add a lot. I'm a yr 5 primary teacher and I play this in my class. The kids can't get enough of it. Each group (7 in the class) is a player. It's hilarious watching them accuse each other. One group had figured out who the spies were and were the sole rejecters of a mission team. The entire class thought that they were the spies for the rest of the game. Suckers! Spies won. :-)

I have the black box edition with the plot thickens expansion.

A fantastic substitute for Werewolf, especially when you have a smaller number of players.  While being eliminated early in Werewolf can be annoying, I still enjoy it as I can observe and learn about the players.  But for those that dislike player elimination, the Resistance also delivers on that front as well.

The only concern I have about the game is the level of difficulty of winning as Resistance.  Having to get everything perfect can be very tricky as there are only three bases to lose.  I will probably try one of the recently posted variants.

I would gladly buy a version of this if it was released by a game company.

Update - 12/10.  Now that the published version has been released and I have played it with more people, I am very comfortable moving the rating up to a 9, with a possible move up to 10.  It really is the perfect negotiation game.  Sometimes I find that people will not want to play because it's such an intense game, involving so much lying for the spies that it can be physically and mentally exhausting.

Like werewolf, but without player elimination.  I suspect though that it could devolve into a lot of shouting.  Played a game where I was positive one of the people was a spy and that at least one of two other people were a spy.  However, wasn't sure who the remaining one was, but had some people who I sure about.  

Ended up voting yes for two parties, thankfully convincing folks to go for the last one.  (Also proved my innocence by pointing out that one of the earlier parties would have to have a spy).  

I wonder how often that happens.  Still good for large groups, although I also fear it could run long.

Once you start playing "The Resistance: Avalon", you'll never play regular Resistance ever again.  

Resistance isn't a bad game; it's just that Avalon is such an upgrade in every way that it makes Resistance irrelevant, and I will never play it again.

I think both versions of this game are better than Werewolf because everyone participates until the very end.

Easily my most-played, and possibly my all-time favorite game, I have so many stories to tell about The Resistance. About that time I got chased out of the room with a chair when I had everyone convinced I was a good guy. About that time that the spies got the first two points, and The Resistance came back to win it. About the time I threw the first mission and convinced everyone else that it was the other guy.

My group has played this game to death, so much that they hardly ever want to play it anymore. But I will always love this game.

I shouldn't like this game, but I do. The theme is idiotically thin, but the game is so much fun that, somehow, it doesn't matter. Would love to play more.

I am not a fan of the "plot cards", however. This seems to unbalance the game and insert more luck than is necessary. I am prepared to try the "plot cards" again, but I am guarded.

I consider this to be a party game.  I really enjoy how no one trusts anyone and every game broke out into laughter with a good time had by all.  The game is good for a few plays but any more than that and it start to get old.  Smaller groups are not as fun.

I haven't really enjoyed my games of Werewolf, but I think that's more due to my focus on trying to win the game and deduce identities and ignoring the social aspect.  I was hoping that [GAMEID=41114] would solve these problems, and it was more enjoyable for me (especially with the lack of player elimination) but I still just don't enjoy the idea, I guess.

Initial Rating 7. Edit: Oct 27/16: Rerated to a 5.5. Always the same, and not good with all groups (albeit better than Werewolf hands down). With the right group it can be a hoot. If even one person isn't of that persuasion the game doesn't do well. I prefer everyone to have fun and enjoy. If one person is left out, then that is a game that I would rather pass on.

RATING: 7.5
This inconsequential party game can be played by groups of up to 10. It’s fun and raucous, and if laughter, raised voices and interaction between players is a measure of a game, this one is a champ. It’s easy to teach and learn, and people are quickly up to speed on the mechanics - though the deduction takes a while longer to understand. The suspicion and accusation means that players have to feel comfortable with one another, because if someone feels a bit socially isolated in the group, this may not be such an enjoyable experience.

Every gamer should have this in their collection.  When you have 5-10 players and a half hour to kill this is the game to pull out.  Virtually no set-up time, easy to teach, fun for gamers and non-gamers.

Great light game after playing a brain burner.  Great quick game to throw on the table when you're just not ready to call it a night but don't have hours to break out something bigger.

So far, the only game I can confidently rate a "10".  This is a game that transcends the barriers of the hobby, potentially grabbing anyone with its power to put them through a real human drama.  Though I may like or dislike some of the optional wrinkles (plot cards, or the special roles in Avalon), the base game is perfect, and all you really need.

RATING: 7
I think The Resistance is the standard that all social deduction games should be compared to. This is an excellently designed game that really creates the paranoia of trust in a group. 

I will say I don't like playing this with more than 7 players. I find as a non spy there is too much information to deduce and remember for me retain.

RATING: 8
I really appreciate this game.  That said, not everyone in my playing groups has caught on to the need for the rebels to push for more votes, more "no" votes, and more talk in general!  So not everyone is up for the work required to take the strategy to the next level.

A fun deduction "party" game.  I can see this one being not nearly as fun with the wrong group, though.  (I did play one disastrous game, but that was my fault because I knew the group was unlikely to like a social deduction game and I still gave it a shot with them.)  I absolutely love social deduction games and this one is easily my favorite of them all.  I prefer the sci-fi theme in this to Avalon, but Avalon's gameplay is still a blast.  Avalon once was better because of more variety, but that was changed when The Resistance was given some great expansions that surpassed Avalon greatly.

I am proud to have been one of the many uncredited playtesters for an early version of this game.  It's never failed to get a group of non-gamers engaged and interested in the game play and the outcome.  I've traded it, changed versions, and come back to the original (now in its most recent printing).  Going to be a keeper.

RATING: 10
The grand-daddy of bluffing games as far as I can tell. Some of the most memorable game sessions I've played have had Resistance as a centerpiece. 

In a nutshell: some players are Resistance and some are Spies. The Resistance wants to successfully complete three missions, and the Spies want three missions to fail (first to 3 wins). Missions are passed or failed based on what "team" goes on them, which is proposed by the "team leader", a rotating position. Everyone votes Yes or No on who's on the team. If it passes, the mission carries through, the team members put in either a "Pass" or "Fail" card anonymously and the results of that determine if the mission succeeds. Generally only 1 "Fail" is required for it to fail.

This game has some of the deepest, richest meta-game of anything I've ever played. Succeeding at the game requires attention to whose on the missions and their outcome, how individuals vote on specific team proposals, and more. The depth to which the game allows for interesting scenarios to arise is robust to say the least. Of course, successful bluffers will have more skill at being a Spy.

HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO SECRET HITLER?? This game is better than Secret Hitler for a number of reasons. I've played dozens of rounds of each and what I've found is that Resistance rewards diligence and effective strategy far more than Secret Hitler does. On top of that, the two Resistance expansions (Hidden Agenda and Hostile Intent) add even greater options for strategy with new roles and parameters. If you're going to get one, make it this one. It's also cheaper than Secret Hitler, even with all the expansions.

Excellent game.  This is the game that werewolf should have been.  Traitor mechanic, but there is a known number of traitors, there is actual information that can be used to determine which players are the traitors.  Also, unlike SoC or BSG, the game is over fairly quickly, which means that you get to play again.  Huzzah!

Oct 2011:  I have been playing this game often with high school students.  They absolutely love it, though there is a definite disparity in understanding of the game.  Weak spies are much worse than weak resistance.  A weak spy can pretty much end the game for their team.

May 2012:  A 7-player game with all experts is ridiculously enjoyable.  I have a class where I get to play such games.  It is incredible.

I've played this game since the PnP edition and really enjoyed it. Despite going into a game expecting the spies to win, I still get great joy out of playing this game.

The joy is contingent on who you play with though. Get the wrong people at the table and this game can be like pulling teeth.

Semi-cooperative game of deception and intrigue.  Light and enjoyable, although it can get tense and mind-bending as you scramble to figure out who is loyal and who is a spy.  It loses points for me because it requires so many players.  Our typical gaming group is four people, occasionally six, so this game is hard for us to play.

There are a number of spectrums games exist on.  Once is the "play the other players" or "play the game mechanics" spectrum.  Some games manage to have a fair amount of both.  A lot of euros have you playing against the game mechanics.  This game is the opposite.  You primarily play the other players.  Of course the mechanics come into play, but the experience you have will be HIGHLY dependent on who you play with.  I think the game is at its best with a group of people who are comfortable with one another.  It helps if the group has a mix of "class clown" and analytical types.

I always enjoy it though, and it's one of the games of mine that people always reference after they've played it.

Picked this game up on clearance from target for about $6 after tax. I had doubts about the game although interested after watching the table top episode on it. I didn't believe that anyone in my gaming group would get into it. Didn't think they had the chops to really role play. Man I was wrong. We played like 10 games in one night. This game was just to be an opener to playing other games but it took over our evening. It was a blast, lots of laughs and by the last game I couldn't trust what anyone was saying it was great.

One of the great moments is when I convinced my friend I was on the resistance, same as him, we both voted the same way agreed who should go on the mission and even located one of the spies. It was great when the final mission came down to him, one other and myself and he discovers I was the spy and won the game.

This game has so much potential, but definitely requires people open to the experience. It is an experience and you have to participate.

A game about deception and deduction. Two teams race for best-out-of-5. "Good" players must try to learn the identities of others, while the "bad" players knows the identities and are trying to confuse the "good" players. The game requires a LOT of table tall, information sharing, and each player should feel comfortable about lying. Very mind-tiring game and requires everyone to be at the same level, else it would be a frustrating game. 7+ players recommended.
The additional "play resistance cards" role is confusing and unclear. Most people I played with preferred to ignore them and rather just play the base game.

A revolutionary game design, that brought Werewolf/Mafia in to smaller group play, and made it better in the process. This is a 'modern classic' with wide appeal.

It is a fun team game of bluffing, lying, calculating, and generally having a great time. Every group I've played with has memorable Resistance stories.

Unlike Werewolf, where a small group of people dominate a larger, mostly silent, group, The Resistance requires everyone to get involved. It's intimate, explosive, and hilarious, but it's still just as much a game as a social experience.

I would play this whenever the opportunity presented itself, especially with people I've just met, as it is a great way to get to know a little about other people's personalities.

A great alternative to Werewolf.  Werewolf is essentially trying to influence a group-think, mob-mentality and progress is made by player eliminations.  The Resistance has no player elimination and is guided by deduction to determine who amongst us are loyal versus traitors/spies, by voting for missions.  Like Werewolf, it is a social-deduction game not unlike poker.  If you are a Werewolf fan, this is an excellent alternative and I'd gladly play both in appropriate gaming situations.  Also, I know many who do not enjoy Werewolf but like this instead.  I really like both and don't see it as similar games, but view both as having social deduction elements/mechanisms (it's akin to saying that Age of Steam and Ticket To Ride are the same b/c they're railroad games, but in my mind, both are very different).

RATING: 7
LIKE:

* This doesn't feel anything like Werewolf which I despise.  
* This game is over in about 20 minutes!
* There is still the whole element of trying to figure out who is who and the fun table talk and paranoia.
* Can't argue with the price point.
* Appears to play 5-10 equally well.

DISLIKE:

* If people aren't paying attention, they will lose the game for their team, almost guaranteed.  I probably shouldn't diss the game for this, but it can be painful.

A better take on the Werewolf style party game that adds more game to the mix. What it adds is greatly appreciated as it gives the game mroe meat to chew on, and definitely more active choice making rather than the fly by the seat of your pants accusations that run rampant in Werewolf. Definitely the best of the bunch that I have played so far, but overall this style of game is not something that I am a huge fan of. It ultimately boils down to accusations after accusations even when insufficient data exists to make those accusations. As a data analyst, this just goes against my nature.

Like the subject matter but the game system itself has nothing relate to the theme.  The theme is merely a disguise to an deductive game, in which players get information from the signals given out each hand of the participating players.  As the number of players increases, the number of signals would multiply by five folds, ten folds or more.  During the signal receiving process, players get to talk to and out of each other, without knowing who are the true spies from the government, constantly destroying the "missions" of the Resistance.  The Resistance is the positive and righteous side in the game, not the vice versa, somewhat reflecting the current disbelief in the governement by the common people.  This type of game certainly would hit some gamers.  To me, however, the variations and the confusion of the signals from the players, are sometimes too much.  You need spend some time to figure out what's really going on underneath - as the spies would know each other and thus plot to destroy the missions of the Resistance.  It is a game about deceit, cunning and making deduction from the signals received in a very short time.  If you are into it, this is the game for you. It is a party game to me...not the one that I am finding much depth in.

During the explanation, it is important to really describe the roles of the resistance and of the spies.  I would describe everything with a heavy use of them.  Some people were in fact confused by the "double negation": the spies try to counter the resistance, which tries to counter the government.  I was hard for them to know who the "bad guys" were.

It was easier to grasp the game with 5 people than with 10.  Plus, this increases the chances of some players not listening, or not understanding the rules.

I found it more enjoyable to be in the resistance, because you don't know who is who, and you have to guess.  When you're a spy, you know who's who, and therefore when to fail a leader's choice; and most of the time, you'll want to sabotage the mission if you can.

"While tactics and reads on players that have played together a lot have gotten stale, adding just one new player to the mix gives the variance that makes me expect to see this game around for the next 100 plays."

The Resistance is a bluff and voting game. Like the famous "Werewolves Of Miller's Hollow", each player will have a secret role, evil or good. The evil guys know who's who, but the good guys don't know anything.... The evil players will have to spoil the missions while the good ones will try to find who they are.
The game can be quite hard for the good players, especially if an evil player gains their trust.... But that's a very nice game, and doesn't take long to play once you've understood the rules!

Some of the most fun I've had with a game. It's more psychological game than board game, but it has enough structure to support educated guessing and enough freedom to allow all sorts of manipulations to obfuscate your identity (as a spy) and to enhance suspicion of even the most loyal actions. I love to pull this out at game night and watch everyone turn into a tinfoil hatter.

A social deduction game for up to 10 players, a rebel group has been infiltrated by government saboteurs and they must suss out the spies before they fail their mission.

RATING: 7
Great game of mafia or werewolf or whatever. As the good guys, you basically try to get 3 successful missions out of 5. Spies would try to sabotage the missions. With that, there will be a lot of accusations flung around, feigns of innocence and much more happenning around the table. Either side have a good chance of winning and I like how there is no real form of elimination; you can always ignore the suspected spies but they will still talk a lot trying to prove otherwise. Anyway, a great party game.

Enjoy the Avalon version better with roles. 
But it's always nice to have a different one with the space theme. 

It's more fun to give out gun tokens than shields. 
Operations is interesting but not a major game changer.

An outlet for all my energy and overacting tendencies. My heart has never pounded as hard as it has during this game, the memories are always amazing. Game really pushes you to your limit when it comes to thinking fast and really trying to hone in on if people are lying, or covering your own. I will always have the heart of Town.

I can’t figure out if I like this or "Secret Hitler" better. I like both of them because I think they give you just enough other data to actually use logic and probability to figure out a good idea of who’s who. (I hate it when these games are mostly hinged on looking very closely at people’s micro-expressions or getting convincing everyone that you’re incredibly intuitive.)

I played this after "Secret Hitler". I think this one’s simpler, and I may like that.

RATING: 7
A brilliant fix to the majorly flawed "werewolf/mafia" idea.  Players actually have a way to deduce who their opponents are (instead of random finger pointing), and ousted players still get to play, so no one has to sit out the entire game.  Also plays fairly quick.  Great art too.

My first social deduction game, Resistance will always have a place in my heart, even if it never has a spot on the table. There's almost always a different game that I'd rather play for one reason or another, but I'm still down for a PBF or Mumble game from time to time. I think that voting history makes Resistance a much better game, and that's really hard in person, particularly since most people just don't care until at least 1-2 missions in, at which point the game is half over.

I played this twice back-to-back, once as a memeber of the Resistance and once as a spy.  The first round we did with a simplified ruleset and the odds felt weighted heavily in favour of the spys. The second time around we played the full game and the odds were more even.

Despite the fect that it felt almost impossible to win as a member of the resistance in the first round, I enjoyed playing as the resistance much more.  The chat was really fun and I would have given the game a higher ranking if there wasn't the risk of being allocated as a spy!

I love this game.  Like any psychological game, it's not  going to work for everybody.  But this one nails it.  It's quick, there are lots of great experience moments.  No player elimination.

The Resistance hits the table more than any game I own.  It is quick to setup up and my gaming group will get very into this game. It is also nice that we can all sit around on the couch and play rather than sitting around a table.

This is a 10 for me because of how much fun it is. We used to play Werewolf in college and this is essentially an improved version of Werewolf with more information available to help with deduction but also with bluffing.  A wonderful game for people who enjoy secret identify and social bluffing/deduction games.

RATING: 6
This game is so evil and fast. Players really need to be experienced to pick up on who the spies are fast. I expect the spies to win the first 5-10 games before we start becoming comfortable with the deduction in our group.

An amazing little game that deftly combines the card play from BSG and the human interplay from Werewolf in an effective manner.

Update:

Secret Hitler just nuked the Resistance down to a 6.

If I have the right group of people, I would rather play this game 4 or 5 times than play one game of Werewolf.  It gives me all of the drama/deduction of Werewolf, but without the randomness of being promptly eliminated for seemingly no reason.  Werewolf is dead, The Resistance lives!

RATING: 6
Moving straight into the paranoia-and-distrust portions of traitor games is fantastic.  However, it's hard to get people immediately engaged in that distrust if they haven't played before.  First games (and even second and third games) are likely to be one-sided anticlimactic affairs, and that makes it tough to get people over the threshold to the good, tense, close games.

And now that One Night Werewolf exists, I'm going to opt for that instead pretty much every time.

Don't play if you hate lying or being lied to. Most games always play out the same way, and I eventually got tired of being put on the spot, taken in by friends, or just wasting time on the same unsolvable puzzle.

However, if you've never played a game like this, it can be electric. Don't miss it just because I'm a stick in the mud.

RATING: 7
Type: 5-10 player hidden traitor game where one team is trying to succeed in missions, while another team is trying to secretly sabotage and fail those missions.

Best with: 5+
Weight: light
Duration: 30-60 minutes
Notes:
lots of player lying involved; not for the shy
can be broken when playing without extra powers/rules by highly logical, deductive players
pretty quick game to play when discussion doesn't drag on

Resistance is a relatively simple party game for, preferably, 4-6 players. The game is pretty simple to start. Players are resistance fighters attempting to overthrow an oppressive corporation-government set in the distant future by going on successful missions. However, 2 players in this resistance group are not actual resistance fighters, but instead they are spies for the government, bent on subverting missions so they fail.

One upside to this game is how it gets pretty much everyone involved to some degree. There are plenty of pleadings of innocence and various degrees of trying to figure out which players are loyal or which players are spies.

One downside to this game applies largely to the basic game without any extra rules or expansion-like additions. Play this game too many times in a row, and you'll invariably have 1 or 2 players start to piece together the logic and begin to unravel the game as they "figure it out." This can be solved by adding in more complex rules, making the mission voting secret (as well as the mission results), or just not playing this game too much in succession on a given night.

When it works, this game is very fun. When it gets played too much and too simply with people who figure the game out, the fun dies very quickly.

Still, this is a really cool game for groups.

Similar games in my collection: One Night Ultimate Werewold (interactive role-based party game), The Resistance: Avalon (interactive role-based party game), Mascarade (interactive card-based party game), Say Anything (light party game), Deception: Murder in Hong Kong

We played it with 6 players many times (probably about 10) and all but one time the Spies won.  I am sure that we weren't very good.  Maybe,  would like it better if I played with some more experience players.

Writing this after a loss as the good guys, my mind is racing with all the things I think I should have thought of as to why those two were the bad guys and not me. At first glance there is not enough to go on but the more you play the more clues you can pick up on, the more gambits you can try. There are a few in our group who are such bad liars that them as spies is almost a gimme but when it hits right - and more games are hits than misses- it really tears you up when you lose, the tension it creates with a minimal rule set is quite an achievement.

This is a nice ARE YOU A WEREWOLF variant with a bit more narrative structure and a clever CLUE-like deduction element that makes the whole thing less reliant on blind guesswork and fakery than other similar party games. The components and art also really add to the experience; it's possible to play this quite dramatically. Minor complaints: tallying and redistributing the vote cards gets slightly fiddly, and it seem quite a bit easier for the spies to win - I recommend the "blind spies" variant as the more balanced version of the game.

PARTY GAME. TRAITOR. Its difficult to actually get enough people to play due to the high number of players required.  When I have brought it to the table, the general consensus seems to be that the game isn't meaty enough and "something is missing".  The Battlestar Galactica fans in my group, especially, seem dissatisfied with it. They seem to think of it as a stripped down and bland version of BSG.

I cannot say enough good things about this game.  I have never played this where folks did not immediately want to play again.  It has gone over well with gamers and non gamers.  In fact, I think it goes over better with non games because the mechanics are so easy the game is fun.  You put together teams to go on missions, but you don't know who is in the resistance and who is a spy.  The open voting for mission team and secret voting for the missions give you some indication of who is a spy and who is not.  But often you think you know when you do not.  

The only down side to the game is that there can be some meta-gaming where you hear someone move or someone takes there time selecting a secret vote for a mission.  This is easily addressed by warning folks not to move and everyone mixing their mission votes prior to submitting.

Fun game of social interaction and logic. There are two sides: resistance and spies. Resistance members must complete successfully most of the game's missions, trying to discover which ones are the undercover spies. The spies have to apply misdirection and subterfuge to sow dissent among the ranks, in order to be able to sabotage most of the missions without giving away their identity. Recommended.

RATING: 1
When playing with the assassin (allows the bad guys to win by guessing who the Resistance commander is), it's just like with Avalon, nearly impossible for the good team to win. We stopped playing Avalon because it became commonplace for the Assassin to stop play mid-round and simply guess who Merlin is - it's the same thing with the Resistance, just re-skinned.

Completely predictable game and zero fun.

I like it.  A werewolf-ish type game that doesn't require a moderator and without player elimination.  Nice.  Only drawback I've noticed is with fewer players the resistance definitely has the edge.  Hoping to try with more players soon to debunk that theory.  

UPDATE:  Excellent game!  You definitely need + players to get the real gameplay experience from it.  I highly suggest the hidden spy variant.  It adds so much to the game.  Great game that plays quick and offers so much.

Tom Vasel LOVES this game.
The sweet spot acc'g to him is 6-7 players. CAN accommodate 10 players. Therefore, great for convention.
BIG SELLER: It plays like Mafia/Werewolf except that no one is eliminated. 
Can be fun with the right group. Worth looking into for a convention, but no rush to buy considering that Bang might work and considering that the theme may not work with the group and/or the kids may be too young to play this intelligently.
Plays quickly.

I'd heard so many good things about this game, and frankly I think it was worth getting, but I seem to have a hard time getting together the right group of people to play it.  I found if not everyone is ready to have the right mindset of diplomacy and intrigue (because some people just don't enjoy that kind of play anyways), the game falls flat, because the people on board win easily because the people not having any fun aren't creating the challenge needed to keep it interesting.

I would always be down for playing this game with the right people, and seeing how it's supposed to be played, but I think I just found I don't have enough of the right people around me to ever really enjoy this game, so it'd be better in other hands.

Traded with Poo! for Citadels.

THEN got it with the Coup Kickstarter with Avalon with the appropriate "Merlin" and "Assassin" promo cards.  This has been one of the best games to play with friends.

There is potentially quite a lot of thinking to be done in this game, and it definitely makes for a more satisfying game with experienced players. I think it's also most fun with people you know well, but perhaps that's a personal preference. I glutted on hidden identity games many years ago in the form of 'killer' which is played just with a normal deck of cards, and whilst I think there is more to be made of this genre in future The Resistance adds some interesting mechanics whilst remaining elegant in its design.

This game would be fun if I didn't always get called a spy on the basis of no evidence, and have everyone believe it.  A good attempt to turn Werewolf into a real game, not just name calling, but unfotunateley I've not played with any groups that will take it seriously.  However, much of the game would still be guesswork either way.

RATING: 5.5
I always feel like I'm missing something when I play this game. Maybe I expect more devices for deduction? As-is, if you're group doesn't gear up debates, the mechanics may not inspire them. If your group does, the game seems to lean heavily on that expectation and it may work well for you... If that is the desired gameplay.

RATING: 8
In a sense, this is the traitor concept boiled down to its bare bones. This is both good and bad. The good is that it is playable in a short amount of time, and with the right crowd, this game loses none of the deceit, lying, and accusations that make games such as Battlestar Galactica so fun, but takes only 30 minutes. The flipside of this is that the game really only works with players who will willingly engage in the social game. Whereas something like Battlestar Galactica has a strong theme, card and resource management, and an unfolding narrative to interest players and engage them, Resistance has none of that. It will either be a big hit with a group, or bomb completely.

That said, when it's a hit, it really is a fantastic game.

A must game for a large group and always good to end the night with this or 1 night ultimate werewolf.I this game player will be dealt a either a loyal or traitor hidden card. The everyone votes on a mission and players go on that mission - the players on that mission then submit a success or failure card - it only take 1 failure for mission to fail.after each mission theres a group discussion and hopefully the loyalist can suss out who the traitors are.
 The only gripe about this is that the more verbal gamers tend to raise to the top of the pile - were the shy/thinking gamers among us tend not to enjoy it as much.

I suspect our Resistance members don't grill hard enough.

Love that this is super cheap and plays up to 10. Card usage can be a bit fiddly, though.

As with many games based on Mafia, there are things this game makes better. No players are kicked off the game till the very end is the selling point for many. But I'd still prefer to play a good ruleset for Mafia, 'cause there's much more drama there.

RATING: 6
While this new game of large-group intrigue offers a clear improvement over the venerable Mafia/Werewolf in working without player elimination, it is extremely bare bones, at least in its basic form. There really is no more than a mechanic here, and while that voting/sabotage mechanic is very well done, it’s hard to get a lively game going on so little thematic incentive. A point of comparison of how much boiled down to the pure essentials this game is might be Dominion without the kingdom cards: just money and victory points. Still a working and even an innovative game, but certainly not using the basic idea to its full potential.

Another possible problem I see is that, at least for seven players, winning with the rebels seems to be nigh impossible - you need to identify three double agents with only two failed missions and make sure that mission control is in the right hands.

Perhaps both problems could be cured by the optional rules that come with the game, but I’m not sure whether I’m keen enough on it to find out. At least it’s quick, that can’t be denied.

At one point, I'm pretty sure I rated this a 9.  I really just don't find the deduction in this game compelling.  It boils down to yelling at each other for 15-30 mins/game.  That used to be fun, but now I find it tiring.  Not the game for me, but a few of my friends really like it, mainly the ones that haven't played it as much as the rest of us.  Still gets played due to the wide player count, just not as many times in a night as before.

Much, much rather play One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

I'm in love with this game. 10-15 minute games in which you'll lie, or be lied to. This game is stripped down to the bare necessities. A simple game system, but plenty of game to be had. It even works with my non-gamer friends.

One major caveat about the game is that you might need a group that can handle the potential consequences. Our games can get quite heated. At the end of a session, I find myself having to shake hands with someone I bashed heads with in the game.

Great game of co-op and deceit. 5-10 players work together to try and complete successful missions for the resistance over 5 rounds. Each round a captain picks a team of players to secretly vote on whether a mission succeeds or not. Among those players may be a loyalist, who may vote for the mission to fail and bring the resistance 1 step closer to crumbling.

RATING: 7
The high mark reflects the game's value for what it wants to be. A party game of paranoia, treachery and a lot of laughs. As a warning: This game has to be played in an ok group. If the group members tend to get very emotional about games and other players decisions, it is best avoided.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game definitely gets people going. Even quiet people will speak up for the most part.  I thought I'd be better at hiding but my siblings know me too well I suppose. Domineering personalities could potentially ruin the experience, so just make sure you throw your opinion into the mix! 

*** There's certain # of players that on certain missions you have to pick EVERY resistance member. If you don't your only options left are spies which will cost you the game. So it can be rough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Decent party game. If the group of players are close friends, the game becomes even better. It's absolutely fundamental to talk much, otherwise you won't have a good time.

Initial rating 7.0, after 7 games 6.8

It's a good filler if you have enough players, but I think that the game is too hyped. You can play a game or two as a filler if in the right mood but at least in my gaming group is not a game that is actively asked for. In no way I think that is a bad game, but I have it as a nice filler an never as the star of the gaming meeting.

IMHO if you have never playe it, you should, it's an entertaining experince and you'll have a lot of laughts.

Note aside, we haven't used the included expansion "The plot thickens".

I do like deduction games because I like to deduct. If you are in this game a saboteur, there is no deduction at all for you and you just try to keep your cover up. 
Update: I found out that although I do like deduction games, I don't like hidden character/traitor games.

RATING: 8
A fast paced paranoia game similar to Werewolf but more fun. You either are part of the resistance or the spies, where each side's goal is to complete 3 successful missions. To determine who to send out for the mission is crucial to the success of the team. This is where the game outshines Werewolf because you have to choose wisely as opposed to guessing and lynching just for the fun of it. No moderator needed means everyone can enjoy the game as playing characters.

Note: Will update review after playing with the expansion.

A fun bluffing game for sure.  If played with players who really get into it, this game can be insanely fun.  A little simpler than it's sister game Avalon, in Resistance you are either a spy or your not.  Avalon adds a couple of interesting factors to the game with different role cards.  Both games are fun and I can speak with some experience when I say this game can get loud and crazy.

One of the best social deduction games.  It works amazingly well from 5 to 7 players.  Playing 8 to 10 players leads to a chaotic mess.

RATING: 5
I wanted this to be "like Werewolf, but no one gets kicked out and has to watch," and it's definitely that -- but it's also more than that. Having two sets of data every round, from voting and then (if the vote passes) from mission cards, adds quite a bit of depth.

It's easy to teach, includes nice components, and plays in 5-15 minutes. It's different enough that I'll keep Werewolf on hand, but enough people in my group are frustrated with Werewolf that I see The Resistance taking its place.

...but after 6 plays, I have yet to see a resistance victory, and that includes using the blind spies variant on the sixth play. Slightly different group and definitely different spies each time, too. Seems too heavily weighted to the spies, unfortunately. Went from an 8 to a 6 on that basis, which is really too bad.

And a couple of months later, it went to the "Grr, this is kind of annoying" pile and got sold.

This great party game is all about player interaction and mind games. This game has an endless supply of mental bluffing and accusation against others. Oh man this game gets our group heated. This game can put friendships on the ropes, and give you some trust issues. Pure verbal communication in this game, so it really fits outgoing personalites well. My group both loves and hates this game. It's player interaction and hidden role selection at its finest. And in a rather fast playing package might i add. outstanding game.

RATING: 5
I may have played this with too many players - it was seven or eight - but although it was kind of fun, it seemed that oddly it was both overly mechanical and overly random. Random because if the wrong cards came out, the resistance had no chance of winning. Overly mechanical because if the right cards came out it was all about deduction from the play and little or no bluff.

Current deduction king with little desire to look elsewhere. It does benefit from having 7 players as two team member missions aren't an option and those are the most likely to reveal the least amount of info. This has been a hit every time, and it always gets replays. Always.

RATING: 10
Awesome game that takes the fun part of BSG, traitors, and turns that into quick 20-40minute standalone social deduction/bluffing exercise. For even deeper game you can use plot cards of 2nd edition that allow you to get more actual data to base claims on. Boardgaming perfection.

Update: When Resistance: Avalon came out I was ready to abandon the original forever as it added Werewolf-type roles into the system, which really improved the experience. Plain Resistance is.. plain. But now things aren't so simple anymore... Yes, with the new expansions that came out in late 2014, the original Resistance again becomes the best Resistance experience. The expansions add Avalon roles and promos to original Resistance and then MORE. Defector, Inquisitor and Assassin roles are the awesomest way to play. You can add Reverser on top of that for more chaos or Hunter module for deeper experience. I'm not sure about Trapper module, but I guess it's something to bring out every now and then, doesn't hurt to have options in one of the best games ever made! Yes, this is the ultimate version now. Only scenario where I'd buy Avalon is if you prefer the theme, won't play often and want to save money (at least two of three should apply), in all other scenarios goodbye Avalon.

Expansions:
+The Resistance: Hostile Intent
+The Resistance: Hidden Agenda

RATING: 4
Stuck within its assumptions. The game doesn't work for minimum allowable 5 players because it's too little. More people will certainly bring more tension and satisfaction but how to gather such a group for the evening. Entire family might be not enough.

Similar challanges with much more flexibility gives "Saboteur" or "Mafia". The last one allows to play with normal playing cards and nothing special except the deck is necessary. So I'll stay with these two.

My copy was a gift, and included the expansion cards which would  seem like they would add to the play. Our group played Good Cop, Bad Cop first, and liked that better, but the expansion for this could make the experience quite similar.

The Resistance is, in my opinion, [i]the best[/i] social game available. You're mostly actually playing the [i]people[/i], so it's definitely not a game for everyone or for every group. People can get pretty roiled up and angry with it, though, so some caution is advised.

After several plays with different groups I can say this is one of the funniest games I've experienced, even played with some of the included variants and the expansion as well, I just love the whole atmosphere created by people's gestures, lies and accusations! Highly group dependant. Merlin/Assassin variant gives the game additional winning conditions and can be played with the basic components. Rating from 7 to 7.5.

Played this a few times.  There's a lot of shouting and laughing and pointing fingers and accusing.

I didn't realize but my cards are marked on the back, so someone pointed it out that we could tell who was a spy/resistance, and doh!

Great, quick, social game.  Rounds are fast and you're always kept guessing.  You will play several rounds at a time and it's always interesting, even without the included extra cards.  The better you know the people you're playing with, the more fun it is.  Easy to learn, can start playing in minutes.  I only wish the theme had any impact whatsoever on the game.  There's no flavor text, no mission text, nothing.  Just some decent art.

11/13/12 Played a five player game. I don't care for party games. It may have lost some of its appeal due to us not playing with the optimal number, 7. Also, the game owner said the "fun" of it is having boisterous discussions during the game to try to sway how others vote on missions and who might the spies be. No one except her did that. And I found it off putting. The mere thought of 7 people doing that all at once makes me shudder. At least I didn't have to waste more than 10 minutes on it. I'd rather never see it again.

I was very surprised by how average this is having heard such good press for it. Maybe I was over-anticipating it, but it's overly fiddly, there are reasonably few components but there still seem to be too many (do you really need a yes/no vote deck and a mission pass/fail deck?). 

I like that it's done away with moderation and player elimination. I think the production value is great, so hats off to Travis and co. What I struggled to find was much of a game beneath the gloss. I'll happily play it again, but it just wasn't exciting.

I really want to like this game, but every play of it has fallen a bit flat.  Others at the table seemed to enjoy it, but there just wasn't any real "game" there for me -- it felt like a lot of random guessing.  I haven't tried it with the additional cards yet, so maybe that helps, but it just feels like it's too "you have to play it with the right group"-dependent.  For the same "large group, who's the traitor, card game" itch, Saboteur gets my vote.

Update: With more plays, this has grown on me a bit more.  I think I've begun to see more strategy and have had some really great plays of this.

I love this game.  It's the best part of Battlestar Galactica without the fiddlyness or a a 3 hour playtime.

You have to be able to lie and enjoy it.

This was revolutionary when it came out. The Resistance was the go-to title for social deduction. Since then, Secret Hitler has taken over this title for me. 

Many say that Secret Hitler has more luck in it, but it just plays so much easier when the information is concentrated in dyads as opposed to thinned in a open group setting.

As long as I have Secret Hitler, I wouldn't bring out The Resistance ever again.

Great fun here, very social. Scratches the itch of BSG without the multi-hour investment.  You can knock out three games or more in an hour, and have a great time with it.  The "expansion" doesn't really do anything for me personally, but it is still good for a variant every few plays.

Any more expansions on deck for this one?

Update: Interest has waned for this one somewhat, starting to miss the depth of BSG provides.

Game in a Nutshell: A streamlined werewolf-like game of voting. 

Played as: 10 player

Pros: Puts player interaction at the forefront and does so in a compact amount of time. Can involve a bunch of people, lacks downtime and does not eliminate players. Not expensive.  

Cons: Takes a play to get the swing of it, so hopefully you don't lose anyone. Maybe I haven't played enough but my impression is there's not a lot of variety built in the design resulting in some same-yness from game to game.

Other: I'd love to try this with a smaller group. Also, I just need to try the game more period. I will say the game feels heavily weighted against the resistance.

Best Use: Werewolf for people with less friends.

I enjoy werewolf, but the arbitrary eliminations of the first few rounds and the downtime for the victims really killed it for me. 
Resistance is a game of deception and bluffing. When a spy pulls it off, it can be the most amazing thing for both spy and resistance. "No way! It was you?!?!", there is no player elimination, and you get out of it what you put in. Sure there are always loud people, but you don't have to listen to them. Your vote counts!

With the right group this can be so much fun. Sometimes you never realize how well your friends and family can lie! I've had some shocking endings to this amazing game!

RATING: 2
My kind of dumb: chaotic, shouty, irrational and quick. But for one problem, which is, of course, that there's no actual game here. It's five rounds of pointlessness that's saved from being a 1 by the fact that it's over so fast.

I'm tempted to say that it's a valiant attempt to make something that could be described as "Werewolf...but worse!" Except that in Werewolf there is a non-trivial chance that you will be mercifully murdered right away and thus be eligible to play a more intelligent game. War of the Ring would be perfect, but Candyland would suffice.

Five rounds, by the way, is not really enough time to develop a reasonable suspicion of anyone in the group. This is doubly true when you consider that the spies won't sabotage the first mission because it gives away too much information. So it's effectively only four rounds. I suppose there are miniscule clues one might pick up from other players--tells, if you will--that might give away allegiance. But that uncomfortable look on the face of the person across from you might simply be the sudden realization that he could be doing something more fun, like using the restroom.

It's best to just pick someone (at random, or on a hunch, or because he looks constipated, doesn't really matter) and keep shouting irrationally "Spy! Spy! That one! Spy!" until the game ends. Your "theory" will make about as much sense as anybody else's, and you might even convince someone that you're correct. This strategy has the virtue of being simple to implement and usable no matter which side you're on! The game is just that elegant! Then it will be over before you know it, so you can move on to something else.

You might want to pick a different game group, though. After all, this one saddled you with The Resistance, so it's likely full of dullards and Eurogamers.

Had a lot of fun with this one. The girlfriend and I made kickass spies, but I'll have to train her to stop giggling when she gets her spy card. She giggled whenever she closed her eyes, so it didn't give the other players any assistance in finding the real spies, but it certainly gave her a lot of unwanted attention. Not to say it was unwelcome, a laugh was had by all, but we'll be nigh unstoppable if I can teach her to hold a poker face!

This game holds up to 10 people, and immediately, you're in cahoots. You are either part of a conspiracy, or you know that someone else - maybe someone you love or trust - is in on it. This is one of those fantastic little party games to pull out when you have a lot of friends around, beer happened, and you want to play something light but deeply engaging without having to first explain what a hit point is. It succeeds very well at what it tries to do, with very few moving parts, and that is a marvel.

An excellent Social Deduction game, and the game that takes Werewolf to the next level. It's this game that really modernized the Werewolf formula and makes it a much, much better genre. Taking out player elimination is the first great thing this game does, and after that it becomes a race to complete missions for your side. It's not very well-balanced in the basic game and tends to favor the Empire Spies, but the advanced game with power cards lets you play this with a good skill component.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not usually the type of game I enjoy but there's something about the quickness of the rounds, the deduction and the tabletop that put's this over the top in the Werewolf family of games. Find a fun group, not too timid to accuse other players and bluff, in order to make this game shine.

Great party game. Can't beat it!

*edit* Still can't beat it. No game has been a bigger hit amongst my non-gaming acquaintances than this. But it's a bit of too much of a good thing. Two games, max, per gaming session is my limit. Unfortunately, my acquaintances solely want to play this. Happy to pull it out each time, but I bring other games for a reason! 

Still, well worth the money and a great game

*edit* bringing it up to an 8.5 from an 8. This game is the perfect "cooldown" game after an intense 3-4 hour gaming session. Nice and light and fun.

Plays a lot like Mafia (even more so than Bang!). The biggest differences are that there isn't any combat (like there is in Bang!), if you're outed as a spy you aren't kicked out of the game, and each game goes on for at most 5 rounds. Makes for quick games that includes each person in each round, with just as much mind games as Mafia has.

That said, I can't help but think just how little you actually need to play the game. The game doesn't really come with anything too special that you can't just replicate with a normal poker deck.

Not sure I get it. This game is probably highly dependent on the group. I felt the accusations were random and no one listened to logic. The bad guys won every time, by a mile. Not really my sort of game.

After some observation and discussion, I think this game might be fun a little less than half the time; that is, fun for a little less than half the players; that is, fun for the spies. I've never played a spy, but I can see where that side must employ strategy and secrecy to accomplish their goal, where as the deduction that the resistance players must employ is done in such a vacuum (except in extreme lucky cases, which might be even less fun) that it doesn't feel strategic.

(220515): The Resistance is probably the easiest deduction/hidden roles game to teach that I've played, or at least tied with ONUW. This doesn't make it any less of a game - on the contrary, I like it how people can really get invested in the game fast and try pulling out awesome deductions and bluffs.

Initially enjoyed this game and will still play with new groups as an introduction to the traitor mechanic. However I take little satisfaction in being able to lie well so my opinion had dropped. Other games like BSG that add more depth to the game and different decision trees to follow are far more satisfying to play.

Great game. Play with a similar group weekly. The deception aspect keeps the game fresh and unique. Really cool to see the unique characteristics of each person and learn their "tells." Some people get overly passionate or become unusually reserved depending on their character's allegiance. Recommend expansions to introduce special roles (e.g. Hostile Intent or Hidden Agenda).

RATING: 3
Vote for mission teams and mission success to destroy the Empire/Resistance.

Plays: 4.
Type: Political deduction game = A game that is played by discussion where you attempt to deduce something through elimination.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 6-10.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Cooperation in the Resistance and between the Imperial spies. Competition for scarce resources - missions. Misdirection. Some cards that target other players specifically.
Randomness: Low – plot card draw, but these are optional and not decisive.

Replayability: High, it's quick so why not go again? The meta-game gets more interesting with repeat sessions as well.
Fun: Definitely. Nervous laughters abound. Deception can be fun.
Memorability: Good, you're playing your opponents and not a board, which makes for a memorable experience.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: Functional.

Who will like this: Large gaming groups.

RATING: 7
BSG in 30 minutes? Sign me up! Well, not quite. It's true that this game manages to retain a lot of BSG's paranoia, but by stripping everything else out of the design the paranoia feels a bit meaningless. It also doesn't build to the fever pitch BSG can achieve, primarily because of the reduced length, I think. I bet this works great for some groups; for mine, it hit the trade shelf almost instantly.

Deception! Deduction! Yelling at your friends! It's got everything you would ever want. A beautiful and simple party game that can be both wildly satisfying and incredibly disappointing, all in the same game. 

The Resistance was my introduction to bluffing games, and while there are other bluffing games I prefer now, I still have a fondness for this one.

Sidenote: If you play The Resistance with Dave, he will try to teach you lessons.

I like hidden teams in games, but there needs to be more than that to the game. The Resistance is just too quick for my liking; there's not enough game here for me.

BSG + Werewolf = backstabby goodness
-----------------------------------
First play was nine people - and it was all kids, so this game probably was less subtle, and unraveled more quickly than it probably would have if I was playing with careful and intelligent plays. I think this rating could go up with further players, but right now, it just doesn't seem to have the subtlety to it that Castle of the Devil has.
-----------------------------------
Ratings bump up after a few more plays with fewer players, and more strategy. Somehow deeply intense and frustrating and fun this time, and everyone really liked it.

------------------------------------

Another ratings bump upward. I like this more than any other secret traitor game I own. It's fiften to thirty minutes of accusation, yelling, treachery, and and deduction and it never ever ceases to please.
------------------------------------

Ratings bump back downward. I have over 30 or 40 unrecorded plays of this since it gets players five or six times each week with kids in gaming club. I am starting to see certain patterns playing out in it, because of the short playing time and the werewolf like nature of it, that are making it feel rote. Yes, it compresses the BSG experiences into fifteen minutes, but in doing so it loses some of the strategic depth available to clever cylons in BSG. In Resistance, either I am clever and can trick you, or the players get lucky, and win, and there is no middle ground. At least in BSG there is an end game where it all hangs in the balance, and a chance for humans to pull off a victory with careful cooperation and timing. I will continue to say yes to games of The Resistance, but it's shortcomings make it deserve a down grade in ratings here now.

A small game with some big fun to be had. 

This can be over very quickly or be a real knife-edge down-to-the-wire game.

A traitor mechanic game that has some pretty good replayability. 

Plays very quickly - a BSG without the chrome.

This game comes very close to providing a structured werewolf style game that is fun and strategic.

This is a great little game to break the ice with a large gaming group where people don't know each other well yet. 

There's backstabbing and lying, of course - but the games are so short that you don't get frustrated. We played this with 5 players the other day. Score was rebels 1, spies 2. One player found the game to be very taxing, but everyone had lots of fun. We wanted to play 1 round and ended up playing 3.

A simple paranoia game with a tacked on sci-fi theme, Resistance is simple enough for newbs and quick enough to fit the filler gap at the end of the night.

Like the idea (which reminds me somewhat of Werewolves) but its event cards don't really work for the game. Most of the time there's just not enough time to really work out who's who- it's all just blind accusation and guesswork with the game ending just as it starts to get interesting.

Wonder how it plays with rules variations and larger groups...

Tremendous implementation of a werewolf style traitor game. It plays really fast so if a Spy is discovered early in the game it can still be really enjoyable.

Too much time spent trying to guess who is lying based on things that have nothing to do with the game mechanics.

Pure entertainement with the right group. Very well concived and good game to initiate people in boardgames. Do not try this with a not very well disposed group. The success or not of the sessions are totaly dependent of the group disposal and the discussion around. A very good social game, with a couple of flaws that you may don't want to try to fix, since this is a little filler or party game. The main flaws are the first mission that is always a success and the game being much more easy to the infiltrators. I did not bother with the cards because it will add complexity to the game. And that is not the goal.

Fired from my collection by One Night Werewolf, but I still enjoy playing it from time to time.  My students love love LOVE it too.

I also own the Hidden Agenda expansion, which lets me combine the awesome extra roles from Avalon with the artwork and theme from the original Resistance, which I much prefer.

RATING: 5
Interesting concept of deception and mild strategy.  I found the game to end too quickly for me to figure out who was helping or hurting a given team.  Once we tweaked the rules to make the game twice as long, we found it more entertaining.

RATING: 8
I don't think that it has lived up to the hype. I play with a lot of people that will not lie at all and therefore there is not much conversation that goes on in the game, making the game rather dull.

Played this game with the perfect group last night. Awesome experience. Worth two rating points.

"Werewolves without player elimination? Sign me up!"

On paper, The Resistance offers moderately more interesting decisions than Werewolves do, since a traitor can choose to not sabotage a mission. But the reality is less glorious and points at other flaws of the hidden role party games genre: all the roleplay is irrelevant to the actual gameplay and only works because some people have a harder time figuring out their probabilities and need convincing. Once you do, the game is over.

Best of the Mafia/Werewolf genre for up to 10 players. 

Main reasons:
- no player-elimination, all can participate until the end
- much more "fuel" for discussion and deduction and "meta"-deduction evolving from the gameplay

The the plot-cards of the full version improve this game _a lot_!

The Resistance is another 'traitor' game that actually works really well. It's broken down in to missions and involves trying to figure out which players are the Spies within in the group, based on the success or failure of the missions. The spies are constantly trying to sabotage them, but without revealing themselves. It's a good game, especially for larger groups of up to 10 people. Personally, if games where you love to lie and accuse are your thing, I'd recommend One-Night Ultimate Werewolf or Spyfall over this, however it definitely has it's place. There's a nice dystopian theme to it and very few games accomodate such big groups so well.

Thanks to Tabletop I thought if I ever saw the game in a store I'd buy it. Couple of months later I saw at Oz ComicCon, and bought it, it was a slippery slope from there. Definitely the game that got played the most. Learnt a lot about people, and started the snowball.

The game is great, I will continue to play it, even after a meta has evolved into our groups. But definitely the easiest to teach, and the fastest game that gets replayed when someone remembers it.

I feel, by the date of typing this, that the Resistance has met it's match. It's spent so much time at the top of the social gaming charts, but in this age we have so many unique, incredibly fun options in the genre that are not as difficult for entry to inexperienced players nor as flaky as far as kickstarter/bonus content is concerned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
The grandfather of the best line of social deduction games.  The only game better in this genre is Moriarty's Machinations.  I actually prefer the base game to Avalon because Merlin usually only allows the spys/minions a second chance to win.  However, I appreciate the depth the extra roles provide and realize that Percival in Avalon helps mitigate the Merlin-effect.  However, the new expansions have fixed the only problem with this version because now the Avalon roles are in the Sci Fi settings they should be in.  The expansions also add plenty of new ways to play.

Without those, however, this is still the 2nd best social deduction game.  There is beauty in the simplicity.  It is the job of the resistance to figure out the spys by seeing how they vote on who goes on missions.  From there, you must question and try to catch spys in lies.  That is all you need for this game to shine.

This game is not perfect.  If you play with quiet people that don't want to participate or just go along with whatever happens, the game falls apart a little bit.  That is a minor flaw with most social deduction games, so this game is still one of the best ever in my eyes.  Some may like that lighter form of play, anyway, but those are the type that might enjoy Bang: the Dice Game or similar games more.

RATING: 6.5
Inspired by Werewolf, players are either members of the Resistance or are spies, and these identities are secret, though the spies will know who the other spies are.  Each turn a leader proposes a mission with a number of. Everyone first votes to see if they approve the mission or not. Spies may fail a mission, while Resistance members may not. If there are 3 failed missions, the spies win, otherwise, if there are 3 succesful missions, the Resistance wins. 

I do like it more than Werewolf, since you do not get eliminated. There is also an element of deduction as well. It's a fun party type game.

Love all bluffing games and especially secret identity games. This seems awesome!
Update: Played and own print out version, buying the proper version. Everything about this game is perfect in a genre of games which I consider near perfect. Possibly best of it's type.

like Once upon a time, Aye Dark Overlord, Are you the Traitor/Werewolf, the Resistance or any similar game, these are perhaps my favorite genre of game. They REQUIRE the right group. Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.

Deduce the saboteurs identity! But to do so you need to sift through all the tomfoolery as they lie their way to the bitter end. A party game that supports many players (up to ten) is quick and highly social. Similar game format as Werewolf, but is more controlled and structured. This is good, but comes at the cost of having more cards and components; which can be lost and or damaged given its a party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great hidden role, and my first owned extremely good game. 

Issues: Game can end up in a coin flip between 2Ps, first mission never has information, seating can make a difference, plot cards are imbalanced and impersonal and change the game too much to a game of optimizing them, and an app wouldn't hurt.

Still amazing game and fun to combine/mix n match with Avalon. I like the theme of rebels against a government, but it doesn't really show through gameplay. Avalon's theme makes more sense I'd say, and I think I like it more too. Overall still amazing espionage game, esp. great for beginners/as a gateway.

Plays: 25+

I feel like for me, even with my Avalon cards and promos proxied, this game too often flops. Many people dont like the social deduction pressure and people are uncomfortable lying and bluffing. Snd if its mathed out, it just becomes not as fun. The variance of time can go up to an hour or so too, which is a bit long imo. But mainly the pressure of lying/being merlin/not working with certain people makes me want to sell this. I dont get the same rambunctious laughs as I do when I initially played nor am I overly crazy of the deductions and such which at times feel like it ends up as a coin flip ultimately. I think I actually prefer bluffing games like Coup or Sheriff of Nottingham over this game at least, though I like this one's lack of elimination. But Id like something more like faster gameplay or more excitement or more player powers. Also at higher played counts, I can split up the group if its a gaming group. Trading now.

Amazing game! Rare in that the mechanics seem to fade away as you play. The real game is around the table, as accusations fly all and players try to figure out who the spies are. Can be a bit intense and marathon plays have resulted in hurt feelings as one or two people always seem to be singled out as supposed spies, but it succeeds so well in delivering the theme of sussing out enemies among friends.

I love this game because I am able to bring it out so often and have a blast every time I play it.

I made my own family themed version of this and gave it as a white elephant gift during a family Christmas party. It was played at least 30 times over that Christmas break by my family. Needless to say it was a huge success.

This game is now requested every time the family gets together and has completely replaced the standard 5 crowns or other more basic card games for them.

I often get headaches after a few rounds because I get so tense. I'm horrible at this game as I tend to be too loud and no one listens to anything I'm saying but I love every second of it.

After multiple plays with the same group the meta game starts to get pretty deep and that is why I don't ever see myself getting tired of this.

Only ever played 2 games of this. We played when there were too many people (like at a party) for other games with lower player caps.

In total, for the both games, I only ever went on 1 mission. The rest of the time I sat around and wondered when I was gonna be selected for a mission. Sure, I tried to get picked, but never was.

And I wasn't the only one at the table who experienced this.

Any game that can mechanically allow this to happen (players not PLAYING!) gets a 2 in my book (will never play again). The only reason it's not a 1 is because the game components are decent (they aren't printed on napkins) and it allows for a high # of players.

RATING: 2
This is a good game... but I will never play it again. 

Spies need to be able to lie, and I'm a terrible liar. Resistance members need to be able to read people, and I can't read people.

Most good games that I feel I'm bad at I search for areas in my play that I can improve on. In The Resistance's case I would need to get better at lying, and I don't want to improve on that.  Not to mention that I really dislike discovering that I've been lied to.

As the only time the resistance members have won in our playgroup have been when I've been a spy I can pretty much conclude that having me on your team is of no help, doesn't matter which side.

Decided I never wanted to play again after realizing that regardless of which side I was dealt, resistance or spies, I groaned. 

Bought the 1st edition purely due to the cover art, but I'm not a fan of how dark the cards are. The symbols should be as basic as possible: A big green check mark for yes, a big red 'X' for no.

Most of the optional plot cards are a waste of time, and add nothing to the game but confusion in how they are played.

Oh, and the first round is completely useless as the spies never vote to fail the mission, ever. If three people were to go on it, something interesting might actually be learned, but with only two you may as well just start every game with a default victory point for the resistance and begin round two.

I think what the problem with me was the first three games I played I was a spy and was always easily found out and could not figure out what I did badly with my play.  To really love this game you have to play a couple times as a good guy to understand exactly how to deduce who the bad guys are...also telling you how to not act when you are a spy NEXT time. 

I am really starting to like this game.

Great party game that accommodates (and is better with) large numbers. It can stay fresh even after having been played dozens of times (as long as the cards are sleeved :-) And once it does start to feel a little old, you can introduce The Plot Thickens cards or start playing the Avalon version of the game. Not recommended for 6 or fewer -- the group needs at least 3 spies.

Eliminates most of the more annoying parts of Werewolf -- namely, the player elimination and the ungodly playtime -- while keeping the core paranoia.  There's lots to love here.

Also, the rating drops immediately to 5- if you aren't using the cards from the expansion (which doesn't make much sense, because if you included them with the base game they're part of the base game, they're just an optional rule) or if you're playing with less than 8 people (it's far too easy to ferret out the spies).

Boiled-down semi co-op/hidden traitor game. It keeps a lot of the paranoia element from Werewolf/Battlestar Galactica. Like Werewolf, it can sometimes suffer from a lack of information in the early rounds; it's important to accumulate information through voting patterns as well as mission success/fails.

I think the lack of player elimination works well.

The only problem is that I would tend to prefer Shadow Hunters for the same player number/weight; it doesn't quite have the paranoia aspect but it's a bit more fun to whack people. Resistance can be played with a standard deck though.

First impression (5 players): Played with 5 players and "expansion" cards. Doesn't really shine with 5 it seems. We played 2 games and first one was straight win for resistance thanks to table order pretty much. Second game actually had some sense but it was overall impression that you really need more players. I'm rating it 7 but will probably adjust higher if it really is better with more players - and it should.

Solid fun for 6-8 players, and a little less fun outside that number.

Some minor issues common to all games of this type, and basically it has to do with a Spy not truly acting terribly guilty for the first little while, much in like Werewolf where there isn't a whole lot of true information to be had in the early rounds.


Still for the price you'll pay to pick this one up, it seems well worth it, especially if you're struggling to find something for a larger group to play.

If played with the right group, this is one of my absolute favorite games. Also, I recently discovered that by writing one letter on certain cards, I can effectively turn this game into The Resistance: (Operation) Avalon. Sorry, didn't want to buy the same game again.

RATING: 7
One of the best games for 5+ people. 
A little too random without the special powers, but with them just tons of fun. 
It does depend however on the group as it needs the discussion and speculation of the players involved.

I had heard great things about Resistance so I grabbed a copy on the way to the beach for a family get together. We had a blast! It plays much better at 6+ though. We found 5 to be too easy for the resistance. Super party game!

This is a fun deduction/hidden role game with the right crowd. The trouble with this one is it takes a lot of warming up the group, and you don't actually deduce anything conclusive until the final round--at which point the game is over. It is still a blast as a party type game.

RATING: 8
A Werewolves for 5-10 players. It works fairly well and its strategies depend a lot on the number of players, sometimes the chaos takes over but very rarely luck leads to a straight victory. It needs the active collaboration of all the players, so if you have sleepers or random players in your group avoid it.
I would have given a 10... if it weren't for the HORRIBLE and uncomprehensible symbols on the cards (a children's clipart would have been better)

One of my favorite games of the year. I really enjoyed Werewolves of Millers Hollow and this is a streamlined, more interesting version of that. 
5-10 players means it's easier to get people to play and no player elimination means everyone is playing all the time. 
At Gencon, its the game I played the most and laughed out loud at the most too. Very tense, extremely enjoyable that anyone can get into.

Extremely condensed Battlestar Galactica. Too advanced for a party game, too arbitrary to convince as a deduction game, too abstract and one-dimensional to appeal to me as a thematic game. Outcome often predestined after the 1st round. In addition, I'm growing tired of the hidden traitor mechanic.

Fresh concept. Very hard to win as the "good guys" 
"Spies open your eyes"
"Viva La Resistance!"
"You're a spy!"
We had a funny game where we accidently dealt out 4 resistance and one spy card and I was certain we were going to lose the next round because just doing the math i was like there has to be a spy in this group. Also there was a round that I played so badly that I ended up picking both the spies for the last mission! Epic fail. But lots of fun was had. It got very boisterous.

I had high hopes for this game, but it hasn't delivered quite as expected--at least not with the middle school boys I play with.  They have fun playing in a chaotic, illogical manner which I don't find terribly satisfying.  Perhaps with peers I might begin to understand the significance of the team vote and learn how to be an effective spy. Nevertheless, the role-playing aspect can be fun and challenging.  (3+2)

RATING: 7
1st night, five plays w/ 6 players: Fun.  1st round seems unexciting, but necessary...if that makes sense.  Though I need to try other nights and with different people.  Groupthink is interesting...

2nd night, 2 plays, one 8-player and one 10-player: The unbalance with 3 or more spies apparently necessitates using the extra cards.  That actually looks like a lot of fun, BUT makes the game much more complicated for non- or semi-gamers and younger kids.  That was too much with the extended family group tonight, so we modified and played 3 spies in a game of 10 players tonight and the spies still won easily.  The game is less versatile if it is too complicated for a party game with "normal" people.

I have enjoyed Werewolf, but this is Werewolf ruined by "enhancements".

I played this game twice and hated it both times. The "game" part only happens for the resistance players, so if you're a spy, you have nothing to solve or think about, you just have to bluff your way through until it ends.

Like Werewolf, you need to play this game with the right group of people to really experience how good it can be. That being said, when you do have a good group that's willing to take the time to try and flex their deductive reasoning muscles, it's a lot of fun and well-balanced. A good party game that only needs 5 people, which is a lot easier to round up than 8+.

Surprisingly simple party game which is a lot of fun.  It seems the spy team has a pretty huge advantage when the number of players is 6, which is all I have tried so far.  This may be the only game I have played where I did not mind there was a bias towards a team.  Trying to figure out who is on your team is very difficult and I love the accusations flying around.  Pretty much a must own for the cost, would really like to try with ten people.

50+ plays. Really fun secret identity game of accusation and counter-accusation, with theories being thrown around with gay abandon on who's the baddies and who the goodies. The start player nominates who goes on the next mission, which is then voted on, and who votes yay or nay tells you something. If the majority says nay, the next player nominates a new team for a mission. Once the majority says yay, then the players on the mission vote secretly for success or failure. Any one failure and the mission's a failure. 3 failed missions and the spies win. So the resistance players are desperately trying to work out who they are and get them and only them on the missions. The spies know who each other are, and they're trying to fool the other players into getting a spy or two onto missions so they can shoot the missions down secretly. The game really shines when clever bluff moves happen at the start which set up turmoil later and people are all over the shop. There comes a point where it'll get down to noting hesitations and changes in behaviour in trying to identify the spies. The time value is excellent, and being able to play with 5-10 players is a big plus as not many games do that well.

Incredibly tense.  I love the fact that the game can last longer than most party games - long enough for the lying to actually mean something.  Lying really becomes conning. If you are one of the good guys, you know someone is lying and you are also afraid people will think you are a traitor and you know how delicate and dangerous politics and influence are.  If you are the spy, you are trying not to sweat bullets or give any hint that you are lying through your teeth for about an hour.

A great traitor/deduction game. I think the bad guys have an advantage in this one, even if there are only 2 in the game (with up to 6 or 7 players I believe), then it goes to 3 with more players.

Is a mini Galactica. Is in the middle of the way between Werewolf and Galactica. No player elimination (very important). I can be a 8, but i think that played a lot can be burned very fast (in one hour you can play three games, and if you do this every weel it can be repetitive). Also i think the ideal number is 6-7 players, it doesn't seems to work very well with other numbers.

30+ plays - I love resistance because it isn't layered with any of the random nonsense in the werewolf series. At the core of these (resistance) games is figuring out who the 'good guys' are, and who 'bad guys' are - not where random identity tiles were shifted when everyone had their eyes closed. 

It sounds simple, yet nothing else is needed to make the experience excruciatingly difficult. It's pure bluffing, building trust alliances and gaining tells. Just look your best friend in the eye and lie.

This differs a lot from the 'puzzle' of reconstructing the movements of people's id cards and figuring out which team you are actually on (which happens in the werewolf series).

A deduction game played as a group, similar to The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow. You get secretly split into two groups, The Resistance and the Spies and then must try to succeed in three missions if you are part of the Resistance, while the Spies try to sabotage your missions. Depending on the number of players, between 2-5 people get sent on missions and as part of the Resistance you must try to select a group that will all pass the mission since one failure card causes it to fail. Using deduction and discussion, this game is lots of fun, plays in 30 minutes and has a lot of interaction. There are also special powers to help the Resistance, since with more then 5, it is tough to win.

This is a Werewolf-like game with a little more structure.  The group is split secretly into normal players and traitors.  Each turn, the current player must select a number of players to go on a mission; they players on the mission secretly vote for its success or failure.  A single fail vote fails the mission.  A given side wins after a specified number of successes or failures.  Like Werewolf, this game is all about trying to figure out who is a traitor, which often starts with logical arguments but devolves into stupid arguments.  I really don't like arguments of any kind; this game is not for me.

Played it twice. It's waaaaay too easy for the spys to win. All that needs to happen is for one to end up in the first mission (likely) and then play loyal. They will almost certainly be given 1 or two other missions to fail.

I find it hard to believe that there could possibly be a better party game than this. The game is a framework that allows the players to play each other. All there is is your logic, your intuition, and your trust. Who can you trust?

The mafia/werewolf experience, only all players survive to the end. There is no feeling like being "outed" as a spy, then re-infiltrating back into the trusted circle in time to deliver the killing blow.

Mafia/Werewolf, with stuff.  This seems like it should be fun, but I didn't actually have fun playing it.  One guess at the problem might be that it's fundamentally a persuading-people game and I am bad at that.

The amount of pure fun had with this game, gives this game a 10. If there are enough people, I'll always want to play this game.

edit: even though I don't play it as much anymore, there will always be a moment I'll want to play it. This is THE reference for social deduction. Nothing even comes close in Elegance, simplicity and tension.

I like this but the key is getting enough of the right people in the right mindset. I'd like to play it with people who are serious about it and try to learn how to make deductions based on the voting... I've read about it but haven't figured it out yet. Often I feel like there is something going on that is above my head and I have no idea what is going on.

7/16/12 - This is a great quick filler game that can support up to 10 players. Some of the games can be bland. I've played some amazing games where I've been able to convince someone 100% that I was on their side and then blow their mind when I reveal my true identity. I've also played some dud games. I haven't tried the expansion but it looks like it would add some more strategy.

3/11/13 - Played a couple of 5 player games in a row with my friends and it seems too hard for the Resistance to win. It's still really fun though with all the accusations and debating so I've bumped it to 8.5.

這是一個爾虞我詐的遊戲，分成兩個陣營，一邊是間諜，另一邊是反抗軍。間諜的任務是要阻止反抗軍的任務達成。遊戲過程分成三個階段，第一階段是間諜確認彼此身份，第二階段是任務編成，第三是任務執行。所有的贊成與反對票都是秘密進行的，因此遊戲的重點就在於猜出每個人的身分，這時候嘴砲的技巧就很重要啦！可以說是一個兼具心機與嘴砲的遊戲。

(25+ plays)  I am always a big fan of hidden identity games, and also heavily interactive negotiation games and social deduction.  This one has all of this in spades, and is a blast to play.  They're getting very close to the perfect formula for this kind of game.  I've now had the opportunity to play this game with 5,6,7,8,9, and 10 players.  It really plays well with any, but I would say the sweet spot is around 6 or 7, especially if you skip out on the expansion cards, which I have for most games (and prefer).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful game with hidden roles! I love the paranoia that spreads throughout the game and the way you may plant subtle suspicions on each other. No player elimination and that it works for 5 to 10 players makes it a great game! I'd say 7 players is the sweetspot though. It also plays pretty quickly so you may have time for several sessions in one night.

RATING: 7
A solid social deduction game that is easy for anyone new to gaming to get into. If you find this for $10 on sale definitely pick it up.

Pros:
* Nice production quality.
* No player elimination.

Cons:
* Requires 5 or more people to play.
* Strategies are limited.

Unfortunately I still prefer Bang! to this.

This game is by far the best game you can buy for a game with some friends that may or may not be "boardgame geeks" 

I played this over Christmas and while it was quite hard to convince people to stop playing trivial pursuit and other layman's games. Once I had got past the (rather easy) explanation of how to play, they literally couldn't stay playing it. We played round after round after round until it was well past time for People to go home. 

It's so much fun to play with friends because all you need to do is lie a bit. A skill most people have naturally and don't have had to have played a lot of games previously to be good at. The concept is super simple to understand and that's what makes it such a good game.

Also, the Dev support on this game is fantastic, I asked a few questions and they were super quick to answer and help me with everything like getting replacement parts.

An amazing game 10 out of 10

RATING: 8
A game that seems light and simple on the outside, but actually is full of strategic manipulations and subtle accusations. I always liked Werewolf, but disliked that the moderator would have to stand out of the game and that player elimination was a part of the game. This solves both of those problems beautifully in a 30 minute game. I love BS Galactica, but this brings out that traitor aspect in just 30 minutes compared to 3 hours, even if it sacrifices some of the terrific tension in that game.

Probably the best pure social interaction game currently out there. The game is in many ways better than "Werewolf" or "Are you the traitor?" but I will still keep all of them. If the size of the group is between 5 and 10 and they are logically driven people, I would play "The Resistance" every time. "Traitor" can play four, and Werewolf can play more than 10, and in those cases I would probably play those. Also, the latter two can still feel right for very dispair groups. "The Resistance" uses incomplete information for the "good" team to determine who the spies are.

RATING: 8.5
I've played this twice.  I was Imperial both times (9 and 10 players), and it seemed like the Imperials have an advantage.

In the first game, the first 3 people picked were all Rebels, and then a 4th Rebel was added in the second plan.  In the second game, two of the first three people picked were Imperial, and the fourth was also Imperial.  In both games, the Imperials won.

I like the lack of player elimination.  The logic and bluffing involved seems comparable to Werewolf, although the game plays slightly differently (and requires a little bit different thought patterns, at least on the Imperial side).

Update:  Certainly my favorite mafia-style game.  It's been a big hit with almost every group I've tried it on.  It's fun watching a new group of players learn the metagame as they play more and more.

Update:  If you're playing PBF#15 and came here to check out my familiarity with the game, I congratulate you on your thoroughness.  Kudos!

I love games like this with big groups where no one knows what's going on.  I've played this with every player count and I have to say I tend to like this game the most with 7-9 people.  The plot cards are a definite thing you have to play with after you get new people acclimated.  I run house rules of secret team votes (we dump votes in a hat) and choose your own mission.  In addition in small games I like to run vote failure doesn't reset after a mission passes/fails.

This is a game like mafia, werewolf, or battlestar galactica where some hidden players are secretly working against the group and everyone else is trying to figure out who it is.  I don't like any of those other games but I love this one.

If you like playing games at parties immediately buy this and cards against humanity.

You're probably better off playing Mafia/Werewolf. This game is all right, but it doesn't have quite enough depth. The game pieces are pretty much unnecessary as well - if you know the rules, they're pretty superficial. This game does capture some of that same mischief and deception (as Mafia/Werewolf), but there's not quite enough ambiguity - when you have 2 bad guys and 2 people going on a mission, you aren't going to fail it if you're a bad guy, etc.

There's not enough meat to the gameplay to hold my interest. The core of the game is just carefully watching the other players to try to figure out whether they're lying or not. There aren't any game mechanics to add information or mediate the game at all. The only way to make the game interesting or even comprehensible is to develop an elaborate metagame around it with your group, which to me is a deficiency. I much prefer a game like Coup, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or Sheriff of Nottingham where the bluffing/deduction is part of the game and not the entirety of the game.

7.5 - I have only played with 5 people and I don't think the game is very good at that number as it becomes obvious quickly who the spies are.  I will continue to play it with MORE people however because for the actual gameplay it's fun.  It's battlestar without the 20-30 minute turn lengths, it's more scaleable since BStar doesn't really work with 7 people and I think this will be a great game for when 8 people show up and we don't want to play cards against humanity all night.

*****
My original statement stands, it doesn't play well with 5. 6 and up however it really shines.  I've had intense games with 9 and there was so much chaos that we had to take a break after the game to laugh about how much everyone was getting into their roles.  I find the tokens and mission cards a bit fiddly with very large groups but all in all it's a good game.  The expansions really add to the normal vanilla version of the game.

Not really a game, more like an lying/deceiving experiment. If you won't talk, the game will simply don't work, especially for more people. You can get some clues, but usually you don't have enough to properly guess, which makes the game random and anti-climatic, really. 

I can understand why some people like this, but I guess you can find better, more engaging party games. I feel like it's a game targeted for younger audience, who likes to shout and argue (pointlessly) a lot.

It feels "wow" when you play for the first time, but after some time, a smart person will simply detect obvious patterns and do a math check every time and simply outsmart others.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Just to get it out of the way, while this shares the same basic premise as the core game of BSG, I think there is no way this delivers the same experience as BSG. The decisions in The Resistance are not as intricate and delicate and sometimes, even though you are a human, you will still struggle to make the 'right' decision, which adds nicely to the overall atmosphere of paranoia. The Resistance resembles the bare-bone calculation of BSG's skill checks and the traitor discussions which result thereof but in terms of depth, atmosphere and intensity, this cannot compete with the grand daddy of all traitor games. Still, a neat little game. 

EDIT: Only good without the plot cards and with 5 or 6 players, not more.

EDIT2: I still like this game because of the meta-game but I feel that it is just too hard (too random) to spot the spies, unlike BSG where you have lots (lots!) of time and occurrences that promote the exposure of the traitors. Most of the time, the spies won the game just out of pure chance (4 people on a mission with 6 players, how can you exclude the two spies unless you know exactly who they are ? Not gonna happen)

RATING: N/A
It is getting a little old at this point, but still very enjoyable with the right group. I am looking forward to the expansions, but feel like this game has overstayed its welcome. I still like to bust it out time to time with the right people. With some people though (the introverted/non-confrontational), this game falls very flat. The built in expansion is very lackluster. I have played this game to help make current friendships even tighter, and it worked well. 

I've played with a ridiculous amount of people/groups though, and have seen some very interesting things, ranging from people using basic analysis (ugh playing it in math class) from not saying anything. My friend also told me some cool stories about playing it a camp. I feel like with extroverted/talkative people this game really shines. It does feel very short a lot of times, and with larger groups the deduction is very little. For larger groups, werewolf is recommended. This game plays best with 5-7.

The only question is whether Coup or The Resistance are my favorite game. They're both great fun, easy to teach and quick to play. I have more fun with these two games than any other.

I definitely prefer the theme of The Resistance over Avalon, but the role cards from Avalon are what makes the game great.

RATING: 5
August 2011: This game is very group dependent.

I can't get into the spirit of this game. I play this as silently as possible and let everyone talk their mouths off, which is *not* the way to play the game. I stay silent because it's easier to hide your identity. I get away with it because The Resistance has far more structure and hard information than games like Covert Action or Werewolf.

Still, with the right group, it's fun to watch players uselessly accuse each other.

Down from 6 to 5.

2011-04-17 After several plays of this, it's dropping from 8 to 6. This game is full of pointless arguing about very imperfect information. I personally don't have much patience for this kind of interaction.

At least the game is short.

2010-12-23 Fixes every single problem that Werewolf has:

* No player elimination
* No need for a moderator
* Very short playing time
* You only do the stupid eye-closing thing once

One BGG commenter mentioned that the spies should not know who they are. This breaks the game; Because the resistance has zero incentive to lie (i.e. to make a mission fail), the spies need the advantage of knowing who they are so they can more strategically choose which players can go on a mission.

Love - absolutely love - this game.  Whether you have five players or ten, it's hard to think of a better "discussion" game.  Werewolf is good, but has two obvious drawbacks - the need for a moderator, and the player elimination (it truly sucks to be killed in the very first night of a long game).  Resistance avoids both problems *and* adds in the voting mechanism so that players are presented with useable information about who might be what.

Balance-wise, playing without the plot cards gives a bias to the spies.  I've played over 20 times without the plot cards and the resistance has won only once or twice.  With the plot cards, the balance swings in favour of the resistance.

But you know what?  Balance issues really don't matter.  This game is all about staring at the person opposite you and convincing them that you are loyal, before turning to your left-hand neighbour and telling them that they are a no-good traitor who couldn't lie straight in bed.  I can't think of a better way to spend 30 minutes with a group of 5-10 friends.

[edit - 4 months later] Did I really rate this game a ten?  I was wrong - it clearly deserves an eleven.  Yes, I know the rating scale you use only goes up to ten, but mine goes to eleven.  Which is higher, obviously.

The only time I'd ever turn down a game of this is if it's past 2am and I've already played four games of The Resistance since midnight.

RATING: 9.5
It can be difficult to find a group of 6-10 people with the right mindset for this game, but if you do, it will be a magical experience of tense debate, logic, and paranoia.

I heavily suggest against bringing this out if you suspect that members of your circle won't take it seriously.  It does require everyone to be thoughtfully engaged for the best possible experience.  One player 'giving up' or playing randomly can throw enough noise to make the experience frustrating for everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I really like the discussions but you often turn yourself in a circle.
A lot of decisions on which the team is discussing are not meaningful, because they aare as good as its counterpart.

I was hoping for game that puts hidden roles and deduction at same place and here it is!

I like bringing this game to family gatherings. New players usually don't fully understand the importance of watching and tracking other players voting habits (I don't always try to keep up with that myself), but the game has always provided a fun experience nonetheless. I could see where the base game could get outplayed eventually, but I'm not too interested in introducing "The Plot Thickens" cards to the people I usually play this with. Some of the expansions look like something I would be interested in getting though.

Okay, so there are some things that irritate me in this game, but maybe that's more because of my group? Anyway, "Resistance" is a fine game of hidden personalities and bluffing. There's an everlasting atmosphere of conspiracy. Who's with me and who's against? You never know, and that's what makes this little game great.

Sometimes I just want to throw this piece of &#!%^ cardboard out of the window, but somehow we play again - and, surprisingly, I'm having fun.

Great game that is similar to Werewolf, but solves many of the problems that some people have with Werewolf. There is no player elimination, no need for a moderator and it can be played with a much smaller group. This was a huge hit when we played it. I don't know if it will replace Werewolf for me - the lack of variation will probably make me less likely to want to play it in the future. But, for RIGHT NOW, this game is a 9.

A deduction and bluffing game that has the secret roles of Bang!, but minus the hand management, various special cards, and player elimination.

The Resistance wins by successfully completing 3 of 5 missions. If any spies assigned to the mission team, however, they may secretely sabotage the mission, endangering the chances of success for the Resistance.

Clever little card game. It is not, as it first appears and is usually introduced a co-operative game with a traitor mechanic. It is in fact a game with two teams (the identities of one being hidden from the other).
The rebel team want to succeed missions, the traitors want them to fail. Each round a different mission leader picks a team from the players. All the players vote if they want the team to go on the mission. If they do then all the people on the mission secretly choose pass or fail. One fail dooms the mission.
The rebels must learn who the traitors are and use their superior numbers to keep them from leading or participating in missions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Best hidden role-game!
This game is extremely and even deceptively simple.
Assign leader, he/she hands out mission cards, the group votes yes/no for the mission and if yes, they put down cards approving or disapproving the mission.
So much more is going on in these games though. Mindgames, screwing each other over, accusing one another etc. etc. This game will bring out the worst in your group and can really suck the life out of you.
What an awesome game!

Update: I absolutely adore this game and have the most memorable games of this one, making it my current favourite game to play.

This is not the kind of game which I would ever choose to pick up, but I have played it once, at the UK Games Expo in 2012. It's basically a Werewolf variant with a deck of cards - OK as an end-of-the-evening filler, but why it's a top 100 game I have no idea. If one of my group bought it and wanted to play I'd be happy to, but I have no desire to spend my own money on this game.

Really thought I'd love this one.  It's still okay if I'm on the rebel side, trying to deduce who's who.  Being a spy, however, kills this game for me.  The expansion cards are way too powerful and makes a win for the spies nearly impossible.

Great little game, tons of bang for the buck. Even if people don't quite grasp how to play you can start again immediately because it goes so fast. Supports a ton of people and creates awesome interaction.

That's sounds like something a spy would say. :ninja:

A great party / social game. Fun theme, nobody gets eliminated and it plays in a short time. And the "discussions" (accusations) are priceless. Lots of fun.

An exciting hidden role game to get everyone involved. I love how quickly it plays. Although its easy to teach, I'll say its not for non-gamers. If they don't get the strategy, it will ruin the experience.

RATING: 10
Incredibly great every single time. BSG stripped down to the traitor mechanic, but quick and easy so it comes out frequently and never overstays its welcome. New players make it more fun, same players becoming experienced also makes it more fun.

RATING: 5
Another "filler" game for me.

Not as good of a group game as Coup. It does a good job of getting a group of players discussing things - so is a decent social game (perfect for a pub). But the game is just a bit slow for me. And it isn't suited when you have players who don't like to talk much.

I'd rarely volunteer to play this one, but would join in from time to time.

One of the best social deduction games out there. Very easy to grasp, and it is very rare that you only play a single round. Players can be as involved as they want to be, and the meta of the game evolves with the group that is playing the game, which is incredibly satisfying.

Better than Lupus in tabula because you dont die on the very first minute and wait for an hour doing nothing.

RATING: 6
Simple rules, fast playtime and engaging gameplay. As part of the Resistance, you are trying to figure out who the spies are while trying to convince the other players that you are trustworthy. As a spy, you want to sabotage the missions without giving too much information away. Very paranoid!

9 plays in 2 different occasions. 5-8 players. Spies are 5-4. Players ranging from age 8 to 50's. Pretty awesome. We have not used the expansion yet. 

10th play was with a third group of people, 8 players, they did not seem very impressed. 7 Wonders went better.

We played our own home brew Mafia all through high school and I loved it. So I would probably like this game but couldn't find a group for it.

I do think just getting a fun bunch of people together and playing that same style of Mafia I used too would be more fun. So no point in hanging on to this.

Quite an interesting game. While some in our game group loved it right away, others did not get it.

The game has some great concepts and I think would go well with some larger groups... over 6?
The only real issue I had with the game is that the spies won all 3 of our games. It's really hard to out the spies to get in 3 victories for the resistance. I'd love to see more balance. Still some fun and riotous behavior to be had.

This game is a nice distraction of the normal strategy full games I like to play with my game group. I must say I like it quite a lot. Solid and quick game play, superb production quality of components, game play and of course mysterious, game play. Game is probably best played with 7-8 players although it is impossible to play with less than 5 players and more than 10. Good party game and if you enjoy a game of Werewolf, you are looking for a simple yet fun game to start your game night this game is definitely for you.

Quite standard and light hidden identity game. Nothing really special about it. Whether it works or not, depends on the player group. My main issue is that negotiations can drag the game a lot, and there are not mechanics to avoid it.
 Interestingly enough, there aren't many 'middle ground' games of this type. Either are really simple and quick or complex (relatively) and really long like Battlestar Galactica.

RATING: 6
Decent Mafia-esque party game. Aside from the lack of player elimination (which is a big thing, I admit) and playability with fewer players, I didn't actually enjoy it that much.

There was too little table talk, and that's from a group that is very willing to engage in that part of the game.

Bought this in the grouping of buy 2 get 3rd free at madness - have to keep the 3 in the same price range! LOL was purchased with Codenames and Anomia both games that have gone over very well in the party game circuit with L&S. 

Have yet to play this though as the group is rarely 5 or more yet. And many conflicting schedules. I know I will enjoy the style, but we will see how it works, knowing what I know of these friends it should work well, and the 5 player min requirement should keep it from reaching burn out levels of repeated plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
- Persuasion, alliances, subterfuge
- Easy to learn/teach
- Fast setup
- Can be a super rowdy game

Cons:
- You will sometimes need to lie to a person's face and convince them that you are not a spy if you are one.  This can hurt some friendships and create trust issues if you have members in your group that hold grudges or cannot separate life and game.  Be cautious who you choose to play this with.  If you like subterfuge but you have some people who might not do so well with the verbal lying, try Coup instead.

A very popular logic and talking game, much like the Werewolf without elimination. Never underestimate the 'without elimination' thing -- this is almost decisive element for a Party game. I'd prefer this to Werewolf only by the 'without elimination' factor. Besides, it's more logical and balanced. Everyone claims himself/herself a Resistant member, so acting, again, becomes a very crucial ability.

A secret identity bluffing style game that makes for amazing entertainment for all involved!

A fun little indie game that's vaguely like Werewolf / Mafia except there's no player elimination and there's actual data to go on instead of just wild accusations.  It's like all the good parts of the Battlestar Galactica board game condensed down to thirty minutes.  A lot of game in a tiny box.

I really prefer this game over other Werewolf-like hidden role games. For one thing, there is no player elimination. For another, the debate seems to be more intense and essential, as the game quickly draws to a close. Sometimes this speed is a shortcoming, however - it is hard to develop any solid theories or detect patterns in so short a time, and once you have, the game is practically over.

RATING: 9
Similar to Werewolf or Mafia, this ~15-30min card game is best with 7 players. More than that, and there are too many people to keep track of. Less than that, and it's less of diverse mix of people. It definitely still works at any of 5-10, however. Unlike Mafia, where you have completely no idea who anyone else is (if you are innocent), Resistance offers limited information through cards and helps narrow down suspects. Naturally, spies can use this limited information to their advantage. The barebones of this game is all about bluffing, but those who like to deduce can also take something away from this game. Resistance also does not have player elimination -- where as Mafia if you died, you were out until the next round. This game differs from other "hidden roles" games such as Battlestar Galactica, Bang!, SanGuoSha, Panic Station in that there is less focus on game mechanics and more on bluffing and persuasion. Where in those games, you speak with your cards or your moves (and try to justify why you made those moves), in the Resistance, it's all about reading other people. I have played this game countless times. The game excels when you are playing with different people, although playing with the same group is also fun as you never know who will be the spies next round!

RATING: 7
Unless someone is being very sneaky it becomes obvious who is who after a few rounds and the longer the game goes on the less chance the resistance has. So, the resistance is forced to go hard early - even though this exacerbates that problem. It seems to come down in the end to who was lucky enough to choose who with their special cards.

On the other hand, if you're playing with someone who revels in being a bit sneaky then the game can shine. Great when playing with large groups and with people who like to accuse and deny till they're blue in the face. I've come to enjoy it more after a few more plays and was lucky enough to play three times in one evening to nail the quirks to my brain. One of the few games around that plays well with more than six players.

A note here about Indie Boards and Cards. I'm very impressed with them. They know how to produce a fine game. Components are excellent for the price. Box size is spot on. Kickstarter campaigns are very well organised. This is a great package to go with their other games where they've demonstrated the same quality. You are doing a fine job! Keep them coming.

RATING: 7
A traitor game in the vein of Werewolves, but even simplier to play. It also provides more elements to deduce who is in which team, especially if played with the advance cards. It is very hard for the rebels to win, but the game is not about balance, it is about the atmosphere and tension it creates, in which nobody trusts in nobody.

I've been hearing rave reviews about this game for years now from both friends and the internet alike but I remained skeptical as these party deduction games (i.e. [b]Bang![/b], [b]Shadow Warriors[/b], [b]Ultimate Werewolf[/b], etc.) always seem to be ultimately lacking in some manner (player elimination, length of play is too long, etc.)...

Wow, this game has lived up to the hype. 

After playing one round of [b]The Resistance[/b], it became clear that we finally have a party deduction game that has addressed all the problems with the genre allowing it to become the definitive, iconic game of this type.

My highest recommendation. Essential for everyone's collection.

RATING: 5
The essence of Mafia/Werewolf formalized and bottled. Shorter play time (20-30 minutes), no player elimination (and more importantly, no elimination of any strategic options you have), and the availability of actual information to base deductions off, all make The Resistance a far superior game.

Having voting results and mission results complements the social aspect, which isn't hurt at all by the game rules.

2 Plot Cards a turn actually dilutes the elegance a bit for large groups (since you have to read cards and keep track of each person's abilities), but that's a credit to how strategically empowering the few rules are. And seems like you do have to throw out a wild guess for the last mission most of the time, but that's still an improvement over having no concrete information in Mafia/Werewolf. And it's an homage of sorts, since you might just have to use the social aspects (arguments, tells) instead of logic to nail the last Spy.

Experience, like Mafia, really depends on how well you know the players, and how boisterous they are. Hence, I'm selective about if/when I play this.

This is probably the only one on the list that I wish we had kept, but easy come, easy go. My husband picked it up off a friend at work, but as our board game playing was almost exclusively two player at the time it seemed a bit pointless to keep it. Since then we have joined a local game group so we would have had ample opportunity to enjoy it. I'm sure some of the other folks there have a copy so doubtless we will get a chance to play it soon. If my husband feels strongly enough about replacing it I suspect we will pick up the Avalon version for a bit of variety.

This is the kind of game that deserves less credit than it gets in my opinion. You could easily make this game up in 5 minutes. It's the group of people and the power of the brain that make this a good game. It's quick, very fun with a group of people, but depending on the group, the game will either be really fun, or really stupid/silly. I'm more of a strategy gamer, but will definitely play if I'm asked.

Great game on its own merits. Simplistic rules. Accessible to many non-gamers. Social strategy through and through and a huge amount of fun, with accusations flying non-stop.

If you're going to get Resistance, get Avalon.

The Resistance --

See "The Resistance Gets More Organized" on BGN
Submitted by W. Eric Martin on Sun, 2010-07-25 04:19 

    "The Resistance is a very intense social deduction game for 5-10 players. While it shares similiarities with games like Werewolf, Mafia and even Battlestar Galactica it has many very unique features such as a quick 30-minute play time, no moderator required and no player elimination.

    "Set in the near future, The Resistance pits a small group of resistance fighters against a powerful and corrupt government. The resistance has launched a series of bold and daring missions to bring the governement to its knees. Unfortunately spies have infiltrated the resistance ranks, ready to sabotage the carefully crafted plans. Even a single spy can take down a resistance mission team, choose your teams carefully or forever lose your chance for freedom.

    "Included in this release is a full expansion; "The Plot Thickens" is 15 additional action cards that increase the pressure and pacing of the game, and requires the spies to be even more deceitful if they are to achieve victory."

Don't miss correcting the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5602071#5602071]misprint[/url] in the rules about the number of Plot cards to use.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
One play (of 3 games), just base game.

This definitely works great and I'm yet another member of "Resistance is better than BSG club". Looks like somebody cut all the fat and meat and intestines and wherever could possibly be cut away from BSG and leave just a bare skeleton. However, it's this skeleton which facilitates all the interaction and interaction is what I'm searching for in traitor genre anyhow. If there is a minus to this game is that it actually is too skinny - so much intensiveness as this generates in 15-20 minutes of gameplay is hard to withstand for several repeated plays - some more relaxed structure (like in werewolf) would help this game to have more longevity. BUT I'm yet to check the expansion (in the box). For now a great filler.

EDIT: played some more. Lack of narrative arch is a problem - you can make one though. 
BUT - with expansion (the plot thickens) the game goes in overanalitical mode and kills and theme. Essentially it becomes a deduction game and I'm not fond of that. I prefer base game, though spies are too strong in that one. Will try some more with different groups to make the final verdict. Personally I'd prefer some narrative, making game loner by killing narrative and creating AP with needless decisions (plot cards) is not what I'm after. Resistance, I love you better when you don't try too much to make an impression - keep it simple!

Interesting Werewolf variant. The lack of player elimination ensures that everyone is kept in the game, although it is still very possible to be locked out of discussions regardless. I do miss the special roles of Werewolf, although the plot cards make up for it somewhat. Just like Werewolf, the discussion part can take a long time, so it is better to put a time limit on discussions. Unfortunately my ability to lie matches my ability to detect liars, so I am terrible at this game. This is a great negotiation and bluffing game when you have a medium-sized group of people.

#15 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

I still remember when I first heard about The Resistance, back in early 2013. I grew up playing lots of Mafia, so I was a big fan of social deduction (although I don't believe I knew this term at the time). Resistance was pitched to me as similar to Mafia, but much shorter and there is no player elimination. I purchased the game immediately and began searching for a group to play with. I looooooooooved it. Absolutely could not get enough of it. My enthusiasm for it has since squelched a little bit as I've found a couple other social deduction games I enjoy more. But anytime we get a solid group of 7 or so and someone suggests playing The Resistance, I'm probably on board. I love the amount of paranoia it creates. I like playing the spy and trying to trick everyone just as much as I like being the noble rebel who is just trying to figure things out. Top notch game! Creates one of the most interesting atmospheres I've seen for a game that plays in 20 minutes or less.

Neat Werewolf-like game. Really good for chill parties. There's a paid iPhone app (and some free web-apps) that take all the setup out of the game, like hand-holding the group through identifying what their roles are and who their teammates are, where applicable.

This is particularly great because I find this is the most clumsy part of the game and, with a lot of new people, is easy for people to mess up, which leads to having to deal out roles all over again.

Much more enjoyable variation on the Werewolf/Mafia theme. Players are not left to rely exclusively on blind accusations and psychology, as in Werewolf. The voting mechanism and the plot cards allow for deduction. Psychology and bluffing is still an important part of the game though.

Players are not eliminated during the game, and the group does not need to be as big as in Werewolf. This increases the number of occasions where you can actually play this game.

Played a few games with pals.  Was a big success with instantly wanting to play again.  We played 9 though and didn't do the 2 fails for the end game.  It did seem that spies had it to easy, so I was pleased to note that we played wrong on missions 4 and 5.  

Since I sometimes have game nights with people less into heavy games and often with too many for a lot of the other good games I have a feeling I will get to play this one a lot.

Update: Putting this at an 8 after latest round.  Played with a completely different group (6 players) and it went even better.  First game people got their feet wet and all missions just got approved, but by 2nd game more talking and voting down missions and blind accusations and just FUN FUN FUN.  Easily deserves an 8 even though it is "just a party game".  Still have yet to use the expansion cards, probably will wait a bit though.

It is an enjoyable group game with some deduction.  We needed to add plot cards to try to balance it out though, the spies were always winning.

If you add in roles similar to what Resistance: Avalon does, that can help spice up the game also.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good fun with a big group, although for me it's more about the experience than the actual game. It's way too hard to use logic to figure out who the spies might be since you don't get enough opportunities to test out your theories. Definitely better than Werewolf though, unless you're doing something else and can't be bothered to concentrate that much, in which case Werewolf outshines it.

This game always gets my group tense and excited. There's a lot of yelling, arguing, pleading, and laughing. Sometimes we actually skip the game because it is really emotionally exhausting but we love it.

A negative: the game definitely leans towards a Spies advantage with more players and the Inquisitor role doesn't really give the Resistance an advantage. It pretty much just increases the possible plays and mind-fucking in the game but typically only helps out the team that starts out with it.

Some things to keep in mind: everyone really has to make sure cards/tokens stay face down until appropriate times. Make sure nothing is being accidentally flipped over. We have a player who has a habit of turning cards face up when he gathers cards to shuffle... it has lead to a lot of accidental team reveals. In earlier missions with few starting cards (2-3) we'll typically have a person next to the leader shuffle the cards under the table before the leader shuffles again and does the reveal. If we don't it becomes too easy for people to visually track who dropped which card.

Az ősrégi Maffia vagy Vérfarkasos néven híressé vált játék újragondolása a Resistance. A játékosok közül az egyik csoport a jó a másik a rossz oldalt képviseli. Két csavarral és egy újabb játékmóddal egészítették ki a készítők a régi játékot. Először is van egy vezető, aki megpróbál megadott számú csapatot szervezni. Kioszt csapattagsági kártyát és az összes játékos megszavazza egyetért-e a létrejövő csapattal, ha nem továbbadódik a vezetői jog és az új vezető próbálkozik ezzel ismét meg. Ha sikerült létrejönnie a csapatank, akkor már csak annyi dolguk van, hogy azonosan szavaznak a misszió sikeréért. Ha ez megvan akkor egy pontot kapnak a jók, ha nincs, akkor a rosszak. Illetve úgy kaphatnak még a rosszak pontot, ha egyik vezetőnek sem sikerülne csapatot szerveznie, de erre nagyon kicsi az esély véleményem szerint. A játékot még plusz kártyák bonyolíthatják meg. 3 nyert pontig megy a játék. Semmi extra, bármikor elővehető, gyors könnyed játék. Nagy társaságokba ideális pihentetésnek. A kivitelezés teljesen rendben van.

Fun game.  I like it with the more people you have.  You have to be able to lie well to play the game.  If you can't lie well, then get ready to lose.

It is a blast, though.  I'd say at least 4 to play.  3 can be figured out too easily.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plays quick and I love deception as part of a larger game, but there isn't much game here and I think it gets its pseudo replay value from addictive high feelings that occur during each and every game (which differ depending on what team you're on). So it's replayable, but repeat games don't seem to reveal additional depth (honing your deception isn't as intersting to me here as in something like BSG or Secret Hitler since you have so many more tools to work with in those games; the plot cards actually seem overwrought to me)

Just feels like it boils down to a social experience rather than a deeper competition. Which is fine if the occasion is in fact that, but this is not a game night game for me. 

[hr]Reevaluated this now that I've realized that this really is a superior filler to much of the other game night stuff. It is a good filler. But it's not as good as Secret Hitler and I will continue to cringe when people suggest it obsoletes Battlestar Galactica.

Not as good as Avalon, since it's missing Merlin.  Great system of deducing who is on your side without having player elimination.
Kickstarter exclusives seem hard to come by, though I think they would spice up the game, which is needed after a number of plays.
Plot cards seem a little too random and end up deciding game trajectory rather than adding much intrigue.

This game is awesome.  It's like Werewolf but has more logic involved and doesn't need 9+ people to play well.

UPDATE: I've realized now that this game can be ridiculously unbalanced at 7/8+ players without using the extra plot cards.  IMO plot cards should always be used at those player counts unless the players are experienced enough for Resistance members to hold their own against the spies.  That being said, it's still great finger-pointing fun.

(2010-10-04) A great hidden-faction/betrayal game, pared down to its simplest possible implementation. Replayability is not great, but this may be improved somewhat by the boxed version's special cards, which I haven't gotten yet. It's very interesting to see the McCarthy-ish accusations come out as people try to figure out who's on which side.

(2013-09-21) Three years on, finally got around to revising my rating of this upward. Still a fantastic game, now with lots of variants to make it work better with different player counts and different experience levels. If you're at all open to the idea of a hidden faction bluffing and betrayal game, this is the one you want.

I generally don't like hidden role games where the gameplay rests entirely on casting suspicion - I prefer games with other complex mechanics that hide the fact that it's a hidden role game relying on casting suspicion.  The Resistance makes no attempts to obscure this fact.  The basic game mechanic is simple, so its easy to learn, but it's also not very interesting to gameplay.  I havent played with any advanced rules yet - maybe this makes the game more interesting?

Social deduction game that is very easy to teach.  The Resistance is similar to Mafia or Werewolf, but plays much quicker without the need for a narrator or player elimination.

A great social deduction game.  It's fast and contains a lot of bang for a small package.  Looking forward to trying the included expansion, as my initial impression is that it will be very difficult for the Resistance to win with the basic game (that was with 10 players).  *Update* - played now 8 times, and have really enjoyed it!  The plot cards are fun but it seems that it would be very hard for the spies to win with them in play.  Overall, I've found it to be about even in who wins.  A fabulous filler and its becoming a favorite.

The Resistance takes the traitor mechanic found in other games, but strips it to its core. What's left is a great 30-minute blast filled with player interaction and actual deduction. It drops the convoluted relusets and player elimination. It's portable, which is perfect for this kind of party game. The production values are top notch.
The included, optional expansion is the way to play, though. The added plot cards were our main source of information and deduction in the games I've played so far.

RATING: 6.8
Wow. They actually took Werewolf and made a quality game out of it. There's just enough information to made some good logical choices while still claiming plausable deniability.

The roles in Avalon do improve the game, but not enough to make me want to play it.

This is a great social game with the feel of Werewolf/Mafia, minus player elimination and the need for a moderator. It's Battlestar Galactica distilled, done in 15 minutes. However, it's hard for the resistance to win, unless either: 1) they're all thinking logically, or 2) they can reliably identify the spies from "tells." That's not a knock against the game, not exactly, but worth noting.

The plot cards make the game worse, so I always play without them. As a result, Avalon is the better buy, as you can use it to play the basic game or not, depending on the crowd. Alternatively, there are two admittedly overpriced expansions to do what Avalon does and more.

Though it's starting to get a little stale for me, this is largely because I just can't seem to get the chance to be a spy.  I love being the bad guy!

Definitely my favourite hidden role, traitor-style "party" game.  Far superior to more complex fare such as Shadow Hunters or Shadows Over Camelot, yet much deeper than Werewolves without being much more complicated.

I do wish the game was less ostentatiously produced, however -- seems pretty common with Kickstarter and Indie games.

RATING: 3
Hidden role games at their purest are crappy in my opinion.  There's no real gameplay and unless you have players who are trained interrogators or absolutely awful liars these kinds of games really just boil down to random finger-pointing.  I like that in Werewolf you can add characters with special abilities to add more of this gameplay to the game and I really like Bang! because at the same time you're playing the guessing game you're also playing a card dueling game that can be very telling or give you the opportunity to bluff very well.  I don't see any of that in The Resistance.

The Resistance SHOULD BE better than basic Werewolf finger-pointing because you can analyze why certain people were chosen for a mission and how many people made it fail, etc. but people can make incredibly illogical choices that make it impossible to intelligently guess who the spies are.  This presents an incredible flaw in the game that doesn't make it any better than a game of basic Werewolf.  AKA boring, senseless, yelling at each other.

A variant of the popular Mafia/ Werewolf games. This game is less open ended as compared to Mafia/ Werewolf as there is a larger deduction aspect to it.

In the first "voting" round in Mafia/ Werewolf, most players do not have any real information to work with and for some groups of players, it is hard to get the conversation going.

The Resistance on the other hand guarantees the group that they have information to work with - the first mission you go on provides a great ice-breaker to start the conversation going - Mafia/ Werewolf does not have this luxury.

Due to the structure of The Resistance, the game does tend to end MUCH earlier than Mafia/ Werewolf. You can easily finish games under 30 minutes constantly.

Highly recommended if your group likes Mafia or Werewolf.

After my only mediocre experience with BS Galactica I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It is more to the point, faster and therefor a lot more fun in my opinion. It still makes you yell "You are a spy" at each other, if that is not your thing stay away. But truth to be told, I thought this type of game was not my thing and I had so much fun. It is true, I would say it is a board game only in the loosest sense but it is more than a party gag, it makes you think you can calculate the options logically but maybe you are only paranoid?
Played 4 times (2 times without, 2 times with plot cards) in a varying range from 8 to 10 players, works great for bigger groups. Those who like "different" game experiences should not hesitate.

Possibly my favorite game. It's a pure hidden role game, which promotes great interaction. It's one of the few games that goes over well with both the party game and strategy game crowds. Get either the Avalon version or the Hidden Agenda expansion (which adds the Avalon rules). They make the game much better and more replayable.

Good party game for 6 or more. Never played with more than 5-6 players.  Don't know if it would get too chaotic or not with say 10 players.  Non-gamers seem to like it as the whole concept is so original and new to them and it's a nice tight smooth running game. Nobody gets eliminated and no need for an independent player to run and referee the game as I've heard Werewolf does?

A couple non-gamers felt that when they were not the spies they felt like their path was boring and all the voting would pretty much be monotonous as they always just sit and wait to "succeed" the mission.

When they were not spiess they should really be focusing studying others and how they vote and try to help their team but filtering out the spies but the game I guess didn't pull them in enough to keep their attention span that long.

For me, I found that in the end it "felt" as if no matter what logic you had based on your friends reactions, voting, deduction of any sort could always be explained away and therefore you never really could "strategically" deduce anything. If that were the case then really it all came down to too much luck.

I agree that the point of the game is in playing the game with people who can get into it and just enjoying the experience.

I would prefer a similar game where there would be some sort of component of true deduction and strategy involved.

When playing the first few times, for me it felt like there was "perceived" feeling that maybe you had figured a spy out because of they way the acted, or voted but in the end it was really a toss up with your guess, so it felt like little to no strategy which is not as appealing to me.

Am looking into Coup the reprint to see if it's a slightly more "strategic" version of Resistance and maybe an even better game.

I am very glad I finally got a chance to play this game. Can you believe it took until 2015 for me to pick it up?

A year ago, The Resistance was one of my favourite games.

The economy of components was impressive - how could you fit so much gameplay into one box?

I played it with various gaming groups, and it went down well with the more hardcore gamers. When I cracked it out with the family though, it went down like a lead balloon, even though similar titles like Coup went down amazingly well.

And that's my main issue with the Resistance - Coup is better in most situations. It still has the bluffing aspect, but has more structure which makes it more accessible. You can also play it with fewer players.

I still play the Resistance, but where it was once a gaming staple, now we treat it like a fine wine. We bring it out on occasion for people who'll appreciate it.

I vote in favour of this game.  It is a very clever take on the "hidden roles" genre, and quite frankly, kicks Werewolf's ass.  For me, it's quite comparable to "Shadow Hunters", which is high praise indeed.  When comparing the two, I would say that "The Resistance" is a little more portable, a little simpler, can play with a slightly larger group (5-10, verses an optimal number of 5-8 for "Shadow Hunters"), and is just as fun.  I can't really find any fault with the card artwork, nor can I say that it's particularly interesting (the symbolism is basic but functional).  This one is a definite keeper - mission accomplished!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

Screams of "LIAR!", "SPY", "DON'T PICK HIM", mixed with cackles of laughter and groans of anguish as a spy is voted onto the last, critical mission.  This game is quick, amazing fun, and one to bring out the best in any group. The mechanics of the game are really simple, and work well to build the tension and mistrust as the rounds progress.  This is a must have for any gaming group.

RATING: 7
Improved version of Werewolf; not my sort of game so can't see choosing it over something with exciting cube-pushing, but fun, and I'm interested in getting a copy to play with non-gamer friends.

Edit: after a few more plays I'm getting pretty tired of it. I'm interested in trying with the plot cards; without them, unless the spies do something obviously silly then it's more or less impossible to actually deduce anything. An example from yesterday: various people saying they knew X or Y, when all we actually knew for certain was that one of the seven people who had been on missions so far was a spy -- ultimately it turned out to be two of them (and one more), one of whom was never under suspicion. Maybe you're lucky enough to stumble on a winning combination, maybe not.

I am also somewhat alarmed by how good so many people are at lying. :zombie:

[Free print-and-play game] {Party; co-op; optimal 6-10p} Resistance is a nice twist of Werewolves.  It eliminates the player elimination of Werewolves.  The rulebook is a little confusing about the setup and vote.

[Player elimination] Some players found player elimination a problem but I don't think so.  Player elimination actually increases the tense and fun in Werewolves.

Not a bad game by any means. I guess I was expecting it to be the "Werewolf killer" I had heard it was. Not even close. A good game of Werewolf is an epic event with a strong narrative and defined story arc. Yes there are elminations, but that "pain" is all part of the drama. In comparison to the "novel" of Werewolf, The Resistance is a short story. Not an insult, just an observation.

Social deduction game.  I played a couple of rounds tonight 9-5-16 with the family.  We quickly house ruled to use playing cards to vote for mission success or failure - so that success or failure cards didn't have to go back to the voter and give their identity away.  I think the whole game could be played with standard cards.

 Edit

 This was a good thing. Getting old now. The game pretends that there are ways of logically deducing who the traitors are but in actual fact, unless someone cocks up, there is no way to do it. This leads to endless arguments, in which never ending circles of logic are repeated forever. I'd rather play werewolf, which is at least honest about the complete randomness of its accusations.

 Resistance can still be fun, particularly with non-board gamers, but I would usually rather play something else.

Amazing game that is tons of fun for non-gamers to hardcore gamers. The only problem I have with the game is that it seems tilted towards the Spies and I wish there was more "information" available (like being able to see people's roles or something). The variants add a bit of fun, but only Merlin + Assassin seems to be one that we keep coming back to. Another problem is it really is only amazing at 7 players exactly. It is decent at 6 and 8, but I have to average out the score between those number of players.

EDIT: Using the "Trapper Keeper Module" or whatever it is called combined with Merlin really pushes this game above others. Fast, fun, and has a decent amount of information in that situation.

If played with 7 people who know what they are doing and those two variants, I'd give the game a solid 8.5 to a 9.

Fun multi-player deduction game. The majority of players assume the roles of resistance members, whilst a minority (known only to each other) are spies. The resistance have to form teams to complete missions, and these are voted on by all players. Once the team has been formed each member secretly determines whether the mission is a success or failure. The spies have a dilemma on whether to attempt to protect their identity by passing a mission (which will make victory more difficult for themselves) or to fail it thereby increasing the chance of being exposed and therefore left off future missions. The resistance however are continually guessing who the spies may be in order to ensure that the missions are successful. This game is a lot of fun with accusations and denials being thrown around left, right and centre and it is ideal for situations when there are a lot of players.

So far only 3 plays with 6 people on a game night.  I can see how multiple plays will help with the idea of bluffing.  I enjoyed the structure of it over Werewolf.  It's hard for the resistance to win but that may be our inexperience (and possibly the fact it was the end of a night of drinking).  I will try the plot cards next time.

A fun game.
I think it tends to be imbalanced in favor of the spies, as they almost always win.
Blind spies is probably too heavy a mod, but there should be a way to limit their power, for example by always only having two spies regardless of the number of players. Knowing each other is a huge advantage, but not knowing each other would be too crippling.
Apart from these considerations, it's a very fun game. Much simpler than the Devil's Castle, which has a lot of layers making it difficult and kinda frustrating to keep track of things. The Resistance is more straightforward but not less challenging.

RATING: 7
It's rather similar to werewolfe, however the big advantage is that you can play with a lot less players, say 6 (is 5 possible?). I sort of like the decision making process better in this case, as you have to choose a team. The roles/abilities are not as complex as werewolfe and they dont really thrill me. I'd rather play werewolfe if we have enuf players. One negative: the production, viz. the voting cards and the other stuff is counter intuitive. What should be a very basic: yes or no vote is confusing with the strange voting tokens as well as the backs. This doesnt affect my rating, and shouldnt effect your game play; just a peeve.

This is the game that I have spent most time thinking about for a long time now..... The 'game' is all in the social interactions and the components aren't really a huge part of the game. At this point (6/9/13) I remain intrigued by the game and can't figure out a winning strategy. I think this is because thee isn't one! At least I mean that what is required in each game differs so widely that it is not possible to solve the game. Being a spy requires you to lie convincingly and hold your story straight. It's not easy but.... Being resistance requires that you figure out who the spy's are and that is VERY difficult. Little clues may accumulate but in the end there will never be any hard proof and you have to make your best judgement. Paranoia, distrust, deception, back stabbing. Awesome (6/9/13)

Absolutely fantastic with gamers; everything that is good with BSG inside 20 minutes.

Terrible (in my 2 experiences) with non-gamers who just don't get into the arguments and debates about who to trust.

Update: I must admit, after 30-odd plays I feel pretty burnt out on The Resistance. Not to say it's not an excellent game, because it is, I just tire of playing it.

Rating down from 8.6 to 6.5.

Very fun game. We played one Saturday afternoon for the first time and had a great time, but we had to check at the internet what cards from the expansion are included in a 6 players game.

Good filler, I'll hit the table again. And the more players the merrier.

This game is great, A WHOLE lot of game in a tiny little box.

This is the game I've been looking for for a long time.  It is the werewolf with a smaller number of players game.  

Covert Action and Are you the traitor? (Both of which I gave fair shots) claimed to be this game, but both fell short because of the ability for one player to break the game if they felt like it.

Update: I still love the Resistance, but Avalon is the one I tend to play more than anything else.  It is the better version I think.  I don't list them separately, but I log all my Avalon plays here as well. It's also the only one I own anymore.

Wow.  I got this game based on its high rating (and low cost) alone and I am very impressed with how such a simple game can be so deep.

If you have ever played Mafia or Werewolf, this game should feel immediately familiar.  It is a social deduction game for 5+ players, where the evil corporations are trying to root out the spies attempting to overthrow the establishment.  This game is unique because unlike Mafia/Werewolf, there is no player elimination.  You live and die as a team and there is never downtime for any players.  The game is excellently thought out and adds in cards that give players special powers that help make the game more interesting.  If you have a large group that needs a game to play, I would recommend this game.

Played this with the lunch gaming group with just a print-out board and marked poker chips. What fun! There was more aspects in this game than meets the eye, and we played it again the next week.

Played this at Albert's place with Albert, Shaz, Irwin, Richie and Rosalie. Was a Spy and managed to fool Rosalie into thinking that I was Resistance [i]even after the spies were caught out with 2 Sabotage cards[/i]. Classic.

Played this at Convic 2011 and was rather intimidated by some of the other players. In the end, I think my enjoyment of this game depends on who I'm playing with.

In many ways better than Werewolves of Millers Hollow, but sadly lacks the narrative.  The art fantastic as well as the theme.  You need the right sort of group for this to be a hit which can be kind of a let down.  Still the social experience here is one not to miss.  No player elimination and plenty of dirty tricks to be had, it stands above it's predecessors in the genre.

Good for the right players, but I'm just not a fan. It may have been the crowd I played with -- people who grew up unwinding convoluted logic strings in Mafia.  It felt very hard to make any move without either outing myself immediately or forfeiting my actual objective (and thus losing anyway). I just don't have the talent for it. And then there goes an hour. So while the game probably has merit somewhere, I can't even play this game well enough to enjoy failure. (Because in some games, even if you're losing at least it feels like you're doing something, like watching the mechanics interact in interesting ways. But Resistance has no real mechanics; it's just filibustering with a vote at the end.)

Resistance also suffers unusually hard from ornery players, and because of its hidden information and length you often can't determine that someone's just being an ass until you've already wasted an hour. (See all the stories about players who vote "fail" on the Resistance team, never mind the ones that do it intentionally.)

Fun, quick playing game of trying to suss out which players are the traitors. It is very much like Werewolf, but with some additional structure that I enjoy. The newer Avalon version of game adds in Merlin and Assassin cards, that add special powers. I don't think these are necessary. I appreciate the purity of the original, especially when I'm playing a quick game with a large crowd. I also tend to like the sci-fi theme better than the fantasy theme.

Received in Math Trade.

As a Spy: Great game! A lot of fun trying to set up scenarios to sabotage the game but at the same time making innocents look guilty. I have great success in correctly identifying my co-conspirators. If players believe me the trust me. If they don't believe, well that is good too!

As a Resistance Player: Great game! A lot of fun trying to figure out who is ruining the game. Watching votes, watching teams being made. I can usually figure it out, the problem is getting people to believe me once I figure it out because I lied to them the last game!!

The best large group game.

Great fun, for a game in which so little happens. Surprising how much fun it is just trying to guess who is who. The only annoying thing is when you get stuck in a position where no-one picks you to go on a mission for the entire game, which seems to happen quite frequently, in our group at least.

Good party game that plays 5 and has no player elimination. It does kind of require the right players and some people find it difficult to 'grok' how you should get information from the votes. If one of these conditions are not met the game can seem very random.

Can't rate this yet because we played with five, which I think is too few for this kind of game. It felt like a rather simplistic, unexciting deduction game, but I think it might get better with more players. EDIT: Not really, played twice with nine players (second one with Avalon). There are way better party games for the purpose, and with 6+ players it makes more sense to split into 2 or more games.

It's a pure game of deduction and bluffing.

Your game group includes people who can't stand being victimized in a game.

RATING: 7
I'm gonna start this with a 7 rating, but I think it could easily go up from there. The resistance was a very pleasant surprise. It's quick, tense, interesting and sometimes pretty funny (as in a recent game where two agents/spies were on three-person mission together and neither played a sabotage card (for fear of having two sabotage cards appear and blowing their cover), allowing the Resistance to win. I love that, unlike Werewolf, you have a bit of real information on which to base decisions (even if it's not enough info or you misinterpret it). Also a huge bonus is that this plays well wtih as few as five people and takes all of 10 minutes to play. Need to play a bit more to see if this holds up to repeated play, but I'm very hopeful.

I loved this game when I first got into modern board games, but pure social deduction games have grown stale on me.

Rebels trying to destroy the evil empire while searching for the imperial saboteurs within their ranks. Negotiation, deduction and hidden betrayal.

This game gets to the table practically every time my wife and I have a group of five or more.  I love being part of The Resistance and trying to deduce which one of my friends is lying, and I love being a Spy and lying myself.  My only (very minor) gripe is that the Spies seem to always win; I'm not sure if that's typical for every group or if that means all my friends are part sociopath.  Still, I've always had loads of laughs every time I've played.

RATING: 8
As social-deduction games go, The Resistance is the best I've played. If you like Mafia and want to put a little more structure to it with very attractive, minimal components, this is your game. This game takes what's great about Mafia and makes it better by replacing the nightly killing with a voting system that allows all players to voice their opinions (and everybody WILL have an opinion) until the very end. More simply put: no player elimination.

I used to play a lot of Shadow Hunters, but now I play this for a more intense social experience.

3/7/2012 -- Now up to 68 plays! I'm increasing my rating to a 9. This game delivers better in its category than any other by a long shot. It creates tension and paranoia better than any other. It is simple, yet deep in its gameplay. I'm often exhaused after playing a couple rounds because it has me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It is kind for social deduction and paranoia in board gaming.

I like this a lot. I like werewold, but always disliked the fact people who got whacked early had to sit out for a while. Resistance fixes that problem, but does not have the capacity to play with a ton of people like Werewolf... so I have them both.

I'm terrible at both bluffing and deduction, but I enjoy trying anyway and there's no game for larger parties like this. And it's short, that's also good.

Traded away because I have Avalon, which offers more in the base game box and I didn't feel like buying expansions for this one to bring it up to the same level.

23 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.

I have increased my rating since my initial play of this. The more I play, the more I love this game. I particularly enjoy playing this with the additional elements (plot cards, Morpheus variant, etc.). I will probably avoid ever playing this with my wife, but otherwise it's a blast. I am not typically a fan of social intrigue games, but the elegant simplicity of this one is pure genius.

It boils down BSG a little too much, but sometimes all you want is to accuse and lie.

EDIT: The above does not do justice to this game.  When played with skilled players, this is social deduction in its purest, most elegant, and most conniving form.

It seems like a solid game on paper. But it has completely failed for me every single play through.

In my last play of 6 people, resistance opened their eyes when only spies were supposed to, resistance pretended like they were spies, resistance failed their own missions, and people on the resistance voted against 100% win conditions after three people voted to fail a three person mission.

I'd much rather go for two rooms me a boom or werewolf with a moderator, almost no one I met over multiple play groups can manage to get a group of 7 people to actually play this game correctly and cooperate

Sadly, lying is tainted with negative connotations in society. Yet there are many valid reasons for doing so and is an important social survival mechanism for humans.

Thankfully, lying (or bluffing, or however you want to term it) is an acceptable part of gaming and is the crux of The Resistance. Sure, you probably can win and only tell the truth, but it's more fun the other way.

The Resistance still is one of the best social games out there. It has given my gaming group many awesome moments that we all enjoy to recollect, and has probably created more of those than any other game I've played.

Werewolf/Mafia for 5-10 players. Without player elimination. And faster than 20 minutes.

It's more difficult for the resistance players, but more agonising for the spies which in turn forces them to make mistakes.

Great game, even more so for ad-hoc groups.

Update: No need to rate or play this, when Avalon is available. Still a great game for those without access to Avalon, or in love with the sci-fi setting. The expansions might also rejuvanate this once available.

What can I say? I looked at the games that I have rated a two and realized that I enjoyed all of them more that I did either of my two plays of this game. The more talk that goes on, the better liar/deceiver you have to be. How does one get "better" at this with more plays, assuming that one would want to? Arguments ensued in the first game and the factions were identified within minutes of starting the second game. The alignment with my gaming tastes could not be more clearly broken.

I'm very torn with this game. On one hand, it's amazing fun due to the chaos created by the paranoia of who is on who's side. On the other, the different rounds begin to grow predictable and the players begin to learn some people's strategies. Best with different people, or a large amount (although that will make it verryyyy difficult for the resistance to win).

This is the best social deduction game I've ever played, by far.  It is a beautiful thing when the mechanics of a game fade away temporarily and the player interactions become the only focus, and that's what this game does perfectly.  Some of my most heated discussions and arguments have taken place while playing this game because it ignites a passion.  You have to be good at reading people to be good at this game, but unlike other social deduction games I've played there is solid overlying logic to rely on as well.  As near to perfection as I can imagine.

The level of fun in this game is determined almost entirely by the players. It's not a game to be taken too seriously and I think it's quite difficult for the rebels to win in the base vanilla game.

[U]Update after 27 plays.[/U]Signaling has taken over the local metagame, and for me a game of passing secret hand signals and kicks rather than deduction is making it less fun. Also, too much of the in-game talk is getting into side conversations on how to play and post-game analytics are getting less focussed on the event and about the metagame. Dropped the rating, it's just turned into a big argument & it grew hard to separate some of the dynamics that grew over time from the game itself. But that said it's lovely too, I've had astounding moments of surprise.

*
[u]Original comment & through most of the plays:[/u]
So many priceless & shocking moments have come from playing this; truly memorable. This game draws out personalities & has the most exquisite & hilarious meta-game. I especially recommend it as a topper after a day's gaming; it thrives on releasing all that compressed angst from playing T&E or Twilight Struggle. 

That logic & evidence is filtered & bent by emotion is well modeled. The beauty & flaws of all our personalities get out there & that's a good thing. 

The rules & minimal structure are exquisite. Produced with quality & heart by Indie Boards and Cards.

A simple "find the traitor(s)" cardgame that isn't really my cup of tea. In our games with five players, the "good guys" won every time. Maybe we were just lucky with our selection of the first squad members (all good guys), but it seems pretty hard for the traitors to win. All in all a nice diversion to end the game night with, but one that is a little bit too streamlined/simple for me to thoroughly enjoy.

RATING: 7
A werewolf/mafia inspired social deduction game. The biggest improvement to this game is the abolishing of player elimination during the five rounds of game play. Instead of direct group accusation and subsequent elimination of one player in the game, players vote to approve or reject members that participate in missions which will determine the direct outcome of each mission. Based on the open votes cast for approval or rejection of mission members and the subsequent success or failure of the mission, certain deductions can be made to tease out who the rebels are in the group. Clearly, from a Euro stand point, no player elimination is good for the game. However, players must be invested in the game. If there are rogue players in the group that make illogical choices or do not play with the right spirit of the game, this game quickly gets broken and completely unplayable. Hit or miss depending on group.

11/08/2014: Truth is there needs to be a range for ratings for this game. In certain groups with a mix of strangers, newbies and casual gamers, this game is a 4. With close friends, family or other gamers in a group, this game can be a 9. It really all depends. So, a 7 is a fair rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
While at first I felt a bit let down by the fact that, despite a larger element of logical deduction, there was still a high level of uncertainty (a la Werewolf), The Resistance has really grown on me. 

The logic element provides something to latch on to (even more so with the Plot cards), and really makes the choices interesting for the Spies. It seems to play better with fewer players (less downtime), and still manages to be tense throughout (unless you have some sucky spies).

I've had my fill on this. This game can often turn into a coin flip.

The last game was the most memorable, and also the most frustrating. 

There was one mission left. Both teams were tied, but the good side (including me) had stumbled on a winning combination who had successful passed the previous mission. 

One of my best mates somehow got into his head that this winning combination included a spy. He proceeded to veto 3 people in a row picking the same team. 

We lost.

This definitely deserved kudos for taking a game with so many flaws (Mafia) and removing a lot of them (player elimination, 400-year long games), condensing the best of the paranoia together.

Like any games of the genre, though, you need committed people to make this game great-- it flops if people don't really get what's going on.

Still, after a few more plays, I really also like that it's super easy to explain. Even though BSG still remains dear to my heart, Resistance actually has a chance to hit the table more than once a year...

People like to have opinions and to air them. In this game the simplest of mechanics consistently produces the most strident of airings. Tense stuff since one wrong move and the veil of uncertainty can fall. The good news is that no matter how busted you may seem to be if you just keep talking there's a chance you can fool the more weakheaded members of the Resistance. I think they are a spent force.

RATING: 7
Good party game. Easy to teach and no moderators required. I still prefer werewolf. Fairly balanced for either faction to win, but clearly, being the spy is MUCH more fun. If they can make the resistance equally as fun as the spies (making resistance more fun, not spies less fun), it will score better by my books.

Pros: social deduction with bluffing mechanic, no player elimination like most other games like it, quick playtime

Cons: limited strategic & tactical options

I'm not normally a fan of social deduction games, but did enjoy this one. When compared to something like One Night Ultimate Werewolf, there is a lot less pressure to be a perfect liar/actor, for whatever reason. The game is short and sweet so it's easy to play multiple rounds, and it's great that there's no player elimination.

Party-game style secret identity/traitor game in the same vein as Werewolf, however no player actually gets eliminated. The only minor gripe is that the multiple voting & mission pass/fail cards can cause some confusion for non-gamers as they learn the game. While Werewolf may be a better overall game due to its simpler base rules, The Resistance is the better game in the 8-10 player range.

After tons of plays in different forms, I've come to the conclusion this is best without roles and without plot cards.  While the game IS significantly imbalanced in favor of the spies without plot cards, it is also a much faster, much more elegant game experience.

Excellent game, but replaced by Resistance Avalon. If you like Sci-fi better, I would still recommend Avalon because the theme doesn't really come out when playing (with the exception of the names you'll say when playing Avalon like Merlin).

I won't go much into why this game is great because that's covered in Avalon and Avalon is the better game.

This game is great. It can support large groups of people and each game is going to be unique. My only problem is that the first round is always a throwaway round, with the interaction between players being forced. By the 3-5 round though, the tension really starts to ratchet up.

I find this vanilla version pretty lackluster.  Without any of the additional roles, the game just never really sucks me in.  Especially this version doesn't have the visible team voting.  Also I'm not a fan of the graphic design used, it's not as intuitive or obvious as it should be.  The Avalon version is a much more complete and beautiful package, but still not a game I'm that crazy about.

Played without the extra cards, plot-cards look interesting. Being a social game this requires the right group, best among long-time friends, but there this works very well as a substitute when you don't have enough people to play werewolf properly.

A slightly more structured version of [gameid=925], which means its slightly better for gamers, but not as good for the other people that you're more likely to be playing Werewolf with in the first place.  I don't really want that tradeoff, as I'd rather be playing something else with my gamer friends.  Otherwise, it has the same advantages and disadvantages as Werewolf, including intense socialization and baldfaced lying.  If you like Werewolf, you'll probably like this, otherwise it's not going to change your mind.

This game distills the "paranoia" game down to it's crucial component. No extraneous fluff, just cut to the chase. While these kinds of games aren't my thing, I enjoyed this one because it provided 30 minutes worth of entertainment in 30 minutes, as compared to Battlestar Galactica, which also has 30 minutes of entertainment, but spread across 4 to 6 hours.

As a deductive - "find the hidden bad guy(s)" game, this is excellent because of it's simplicity.  It's definitely one of my go-to party games, it's small enough to easily bring places (camping, the pub, etc) - not quite pocket sized but close to it. It only takes a few minutes to teach the rules to new players. Most importantly it's lots and lots of fun.

Second Update: Up to somewhere around 18 plays now (started playing before recording plays) and I've greatly upgraded the rating. The game gets way better with experienced players, although a "lame" session is still possible. Probably my favorite large party game at the moment.

Updated: I've played it about 10 times now. We've had that original "lame" case three times, but the other times were absurdly fun. It really depends where the spies start in comparison to the starting player.

Original: Unless we played it incorrectly, it seemed impossible for the spies to win unless the Resistance were really dumb. We played with 8 players.

The Resistance is a lively game of deduction. There are just enough known factors to spark rational discussion and accusations, while there are sufficient unknowns to usually prevent an ironclad deduction, keeping the game tense to the finish.

This game is loads of fun BUT is very group dependent. Younger players may struggle to grasp the game and 1 or 2 players that don't "get it" can really water down the fun. The good news is that it usually only takes 1 game (or even part of a game) to grasp how things work.

Nice concept. This game manages to contain such gameplay with few component, and once the discussion starts this game shines.

So this game is leaving my collection.

It's hard for me to play hidden role games well when I'm selected as a traitor, because it's hard for me to lie, and if I win, some part of me thinks that those people I deceived will never trust me completely again.  The Resistance is a nice take on the concept of Werewolf, and the hardcore Werewolf players are saying that this game actually improves on it somewhat.  For me, though, I get that same feeling of being anxious whenever I play, and it's hard for me to see much difference in the games.  The idea of the game is appealing, but the execution makes my blood pressure go up, and the doctor told me to avoid anything that does that.

I own the Resistance, love it, and have played it around ten times with many different groups.  It's a fantastic game, especially for it's low price.  I would say that the Resistance: Avalon is superior and would recommend it for new players.  But you can't go wrong with either game.  The game fills a unique position for when you have 5-8 people who want to play a game, and one that won't end up taking 3 hours like a 5 player game of Power Grid. 

Best with 5-8 players.  I believe it plays up to ten, but ten is too many as some players will not be involved in the game at all.

The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!
\13\\13\
The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.
\13\\13\
Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players. Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.

I see this one being really fun if you are very vocal and enjoy debating, but it could be intimidating if you are not.  It did feel very thematic to me, though.  My heart was pounding when I was the spy, and I felt very guilty about lying to the members of the Resistance about my loyalty.  I really liked that there wasn't player elimination, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The Resistance is a social deduction game, like Werewolf, but designed for far smaller groups. It only works with a loud and rambunctious crowd, as blindly (at least initially) accusing people of being a spy is the entirety of game play. Everything is abstract, you basically pick a few people to go on a mission and then they vote to be successful or to sabotage it. Essentially, it's nothing more than the Crisis phase from Battlestar Galactica. The lack of backstory for The Resistance's mission phase means that the immersion level is far lower and less satisfying than BSG, but the rules overhead and start up time is also significantly smaller. Admittedly, the best parts of BSG are the Cylon accusations, so focusing a game completely on that is a bit of a master stroke.

It's not terribly deep, but it's fun and extremely portable, (and cheap) so I think it has a place in almost any collection.

RATING: 7
This was a big disappointment for me; even though I liked the game, I was really hoping for "Battlestar Galactica in 20 minutes!", which this is not. It's more like a streamlined Werewolf, which is not a bad thing, but it shares the biggest problem I have with that game, which is that it's pretty much all about the personalities of the players. To me, BSG's biggest innovation on the concept (and the reason it's one of my favorite games) is the way in which the skill checks work. As a cylon, you can sabotage the check by only putting in a low value "good" card, and even if you put in a negative card, the destiny deck shields you slightly. In The Resistance, a sabotage card narrows it down pretty well, and if you bluff by playing positive cards at the beginning, it's a risky proposition since you don't know if you'll be selected again. Again, it's not a bad game, but I was really hoping to have something that I could play that captured the same feel as BSG in 10% of the time, but this is instead an improved, focused version of Werewolf that's more true to the roots of the game. In other words, something I'll play if others want to, but nothing I'll go out of my way to track down.

Improved Werewolf? Overall, I think so. No elimination is fantastic, and the two-staged mission system is good.

But the theme is not remotely as appealing as Werewolf, and I miss the rule-breaking roles. The action cards are not as good as hoped for.

This game is so awesome.  You're given enough information to perform some quite complex deductive reasoning, but not enough to completely solve the problem.  I'm a logic guy and tend to argue vociferously for that angle, but so far the intuition and people-reading folks have been just as (if not more) accurate.  So there's still plenty of room for that.

Our group loved Werewolf, but I can't see us ever going back.  This game is Werewolf perfected.  The Resistance is more condensed and constrained than Werewolf, but our games actually end up taking longer because of all the protracted arguing, counter-arguing, and whatnot.  That's the fun part, of course.

Both being a spy and a resistance member are a ton of fun.  It's fun to puzzle through the information as a resistance member, and of course fun to deceive as a spy.

We've given the optional plot cards a few whirls, but they didn't take.  Straight up, this game is a pitch-perfect blend of deduction, people reading, and vein-popping arguments.  No need to jazz it up.

Never gets old assuming you have a good group of people. IF everyone is shy then it's boring but even if you just have 2 outspoken people, it'll drive the group into having a great time. 5-10 people, doesn't matter, each number of players has elements of difficulty for spies and resistance. I love it love it love. Go to game for 7+ people for sure but fun with 5-6 as well.

This game is mafia with some basic goals. I'll play it in a party situation, but it is basically an expensive version of mafia and the fact that this is in the BGG Top 100 baffles me, although I can understand why it's a top party game.

RATING: 5.5
Put me in the not a fan category.  The concept is decent, but the game is too prone to streaks in the player order.  We played three games, and each time we were able to identify the spies after three rounds.  At that point, it was impossible for the spies to have any impact on the game. 

I'm not sure what would work better, but we never felt pressured by the spies the entire time.

A game of social deductio with no player elimination. you are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, you must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, you must try to deduce the other players identities and gain their trust. Each turn you must put together a team, that you trust, to go on a mission. If you are a spy you must blend in and throw off suspession, if you are resistance, you must find the spies before it is too late.

This game is great fun.  First off, it is very approachable.  The theme isn't so specific that it will turn away non-gamers.  Second, it is easy to learn and teach.  Third, it can play up to 10 players, which makes the game great in party situations.  Fourth, it is quick.  That makes it great when you have enough players and you are looking for a game that won't take you hours.  You can introduce this game to new people easily and there is a good chance that it will be a hit.  One concern is that it does require at least 5 players, and sometimes that is not the best number in gaming groups.  But if you have the players, give this one a shot.

Okay, I didn't think it was possible, but I actually like this better than Werewolf. It's got all the same fun of trying to be a convincing liar or trying to identify the liars, but no player elimination, and better ways for generating information in my opinion (leader's proposal & discussion around leader's proposal, votes to accept/reject mission, mission results).

i am ver sorry but i must be harsh on this. how can such a game be 75th on the BGG list? this is so far removed from the very concepts of enjoyment, fun, game. We tried in 10 and almost everyone was like "is this really a game?". It looks more the owner of the game was cheated. No fun at all. I will avoid it as cockroaches in my soup from now on. There's really nothing, it's just a give cards away, show one of two cards, choose one of two cards, repeat forever.

This can be a great party game, but in my experience you have to have a good balance of personalities. Its no fun if everyone is just quiet, but if too many people are playing up the drama it can be overwhelming. The game is a hidden role game where players select different teams to complete missions and based on the outcome of those missions players need to determine who the spies are. If you have the right group it is a lot of fun with, all of the accusations. "I'm not the spy!" "That's exactly what a spy would say!" "...?"

Hidden traitor game that lacks the role variety of Werewolf but also has no player elimination (unlike proper Werewolf) and five rounds (unlike One Night Werewolf).

RATING: 9.6
With the right group, this is a fantastic game. My favorite party game by far. There is so much player interaction, bluffing, accusations and logic involved that I want to play it more and more and more. 
8.5 after 10 plays
--
Raised the rating to 9+ after 20 plays. A game I rarely would decline to play. My most memorable, enjoyable, loudest and funniest gaming moments has come with this game. Prefer this game a lot over Avalon. 
-- 
After 40+ plays it now has reached a 9.6 rating. The game is a masterpiece. The rogue-cards in the expansion also helps a little with gameplay at some player-numbers that needed some extra depth. 
The only complain about the game is that a round can be ruined if a new player joins that don´t understand the game at all. Also, the game can be a bit dull if the players doesnt interact and try to play the game as it is intended to.

RATING: 6.5
After a few plays it felt a little simplistic, but maybe that was just the group I was playing with.  I'm sure the stratagems would morph and grow with continued plays.  There is definitely some fun, suspense, and energy involved.   In general, bluffing games are not my thing.

We played this a few times during the Thanksgiving holiday and really enjoyed it. It was fun trying to deduce who the spies were, and we discovered some people were very good at deceit. The key is a strong poker face, and either not saying anything, or saying just the right thing at the right time. We had a younger player who didn't quite understand the nuances, and ruined it because he didn't know why he should vote a certain way. But other than that, it was a solid game that would probably be more fun with the larger number of players.

Uitstekend psychologisch spel waarin de spelers in twee kampen worden opgedeeld.

De spelers zijn of spion of verzetsstrijder. Door missies uit te voeren en deze al dan niet te laten lukken moeten de verzetsstrijders op het spoor van de spionnen zetten. Leuk is dat iedereen moet stemmen op ieder voorstel dat wordt gedaan over welke spelers de missie gaan uitvoeren.

Uitstekend voor een grotere groep mensen.

Love this game. Really simple mechanic that can get super interesting, and suits groups who love a bit of roleplay and bluffing.

Main disadvantage is the number of players required... and my non geek friends really struggle with it for some reason. Maybe it's because they're usually drunk by the time we get the games out.

RATING: 7
I hate to use a deductive proof to explain why I'll never play this game again, but here goes:

[i]Premise A[/i]: I have to be at the point where I'm burnt out and delirious from playing "normal" games before I'm willing to play a party game.

[i]Premise B[/i]: The Resistance is a party game that requires focused mental activity to be satisfying.

[i]Conclusion[/i]: Premises A and B are mutually exclusive, so The Resistance has deduced itself right into the trash heap.

[i]Update:[/i]

Much better the second time, and it even plays well with five.  It's nice when games improve with time, which can be a rarity these days.

Not really a party game, either, so I'll cut out my tongue and ask for forgiveness.

Two plays with six.  Was a blast!  First game I was a spy and we won, second I was a good guy and we won.  We played it a little wrong but man, it was a fun time.

Played recently with a completely different six.  BOY does this game really depend on your group.  Fell flat.

Played two more games recently with the orginial six plus another; so seven.  Game was amazing again.  It really does depend on your group.  With the right group this game REALLY shines :).

Decent "traitor" game.  The lack of player elimination (unline Werewolf) is interesting and adds to the appeal a bit, but it's still not even remotely close to being as fun as BSG.

It would be nice if there was a little more you could do once you *know* who the spies are beyond just voting against them, but it plays fairly quick so it's not that big of a problem.

Think Werewolf without elimination: A "party game" full of deception that will have your friends yelling at each other well after the game is over. Seriousness and attention from all players is required, or the game will flop.

Quick to set up, quick to get going, and fills the 'werewolf' game section for lower player-counts nicely. There seems to be less storytelling possible in this game and therefore less role-playing occurs, which is a shame (something I like doing when playing a 'werewolf'-style game).

While I still stand by my original statement in the beginning of 2014 that, "This is a game that I think everyone should have in their collection", it hasn't come to the table as much as I originally thought/hoped. While it's a ton of fun with the right group of people and something that I'd enjoy playing at any gathering, you really do need to have the "right" group of people to play this game.

My gaming group tends to focus on my strategic games and/or ones that can be played with 3-4 people. With the Resistance, you really need at least 5 and probably more like 7 or 8 to really have a lot of fun. The problem is, the people that I thought this would most appeal to (eg., my non-gaming friends) have never really warmed up to it... or games in general. As such, it's just sit on my shelf. It's something that I'll probably hold on to though as you never know when the right opportunity will arise to play it. Luckily it's such a small box...

Battlestar, for instance, has a huge amount of chrome injected, and I find the chrome uninteresting.

Since I and my friends have a heart on for deduction games, this one just couldn't miss in my collection. And indeed, it's a total blast! I've played it about 15 times now, and 1 of my friends who's played all those 15 times as well, never has been a spy before. So now, each game, everyone assumes he will be a spy next time. So much paranoia... I love it.

Played around 10 games last night (april 7th, 2012) and it was awesome. The guy that never has been a spy before was a few times spy this time. And once again, I was the spy pretty often.

A very simple and short game that is suitable for a large group of light board gamers. It contains a huge bluffing element, which makes it fun for large groups of people. Suitable for gatherings or parties, but still requires some thought and deduction.

The theme is a little pasted on, though it does not matter much in this case.

A game of social deduction (which means that everybody is in on trying to puzzle things out or to misdirect, depending on wwho's side they are on). For the game to be fun needs more people (ie a game with 10 people plays better than a game with 5) and the players to get into the game. 
Its a keeper because its light and quick.

Fantastic fun! I love this social, paranoia-driven game. It's a perfect filler for 5-10 player groups, and also works equally well as a party game with the right crowd.

It distills the "traitor mechanism" from so many other games, such as Battlestar Galactica, into its bare essentials and a short filler, but still retains the paranoia and other good bits of bluffing, lying, and deceiving your friends. I highly recommend it.

I had a good time playing, but felt it was almost impossible to have the "good guys" win.  The mechanics just aren't there to have a more analytical approach that works with most groups of people. The Resistance: Avalon is this game except with more and more interesting bits.  Because, and compared to that game, I have to give this a lower score; just because I don't see much point to this game with the other version out there in the world!

If Avalon didn't exist, I'd probably have to give this game a 7.5

I usually don't like games with more than 6 players as they tend to drag getting bogged down in all the player decisions.  This game remains fun and light regardless of number and plays quickly for a couple of sessions in an hour if you're in the mood.  I love the traitor mechanic in Shadows over Camelot and BSG... but those are some clunky, dragging animals i feel no need to play again having had a shot at The Resistance!

I really like the base game with odd numbers.  I now always add the Merlin variant with even numbers though to make the Resistance skewed games more interesting.

I don't get why people are so fond of this game. To me it seems a stripped down Wherewolves. Yes, no player elimination is good but the game is way too quick and leaves almost no clues to understand who is the spy, leaving all the meat to the meta-game.
I guess it can appeal to some, but not me (or my group), so I'm trading it away.

I'm not a huge fan of social-deduction games. This was the first that I played. While I can appreciate its elegant design, it really takes a good group to make the game more fun. Sometimes the rebels feel like they're grasping for straws and discussion can devolve quickly. Apparently, my wife thinks that I'm a convincing spy.

This is Werewolf in a box. I haven’t played real life WW before so I can’t compare directly, but I do really enjoy The Resistance. The spies always win because we only play with the base cards, but the social aspect makes it so hilarious that I don’t care about the outcome. It’s way more fun just to accuse people blindly and then laugh at how wrong you were when the spies reveal post-game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I like Werewolf (When played as a real party game, with several rooms, and interesting roles), but this is utter and total crap. The lowest possible rating I can give a game that doesn't threaten to kill me.

I've played 5 times (8 people) and it's  an exercise in futility. Best of 5 is much too short to get any sort of information that's reliable, so in the end, it's just a guess. The spies win if the players are confused. Raising confusion isn't hard if you're a good player. In the end, there's a multitude of theories of who is and who isn't that it's just basically a hunch shot of who are spies. Played effectively, the spies are next to guaranteed a win, unless the resistance hits a real lucky streak. And I wouldn't ever play this with players who don't play effectively, hence it's senseless to play at all.

After two plays, my feelings were that this was just pure crap. Three more games and I was still convinced. I was resistance 3 times and spy 2 times and it was the same story all five times: Theories on who was who popped up based on who voted yes/no for whatever constellation of participants, and later on, based on who had participated in what and if that failed/succeeded. About all of them made sense, so random accusasions and "gut feelings" flew through the air. By the third round, there were so many theories (that were all plausible) about who had bluffed when that there was nothing clear to go on. Round 4, when the spies needed 2 fails, was easy as pie for the spies, just vote down anything that doesn't fit, same for 5th round and voilà. Add to that that everyone was clever enough not to leave trails, and at the end, it was up to a max 25% guess for the resistance to win.

Utter piece of crap and waste of precious gaming time.

Hope to be playing this this coming weekend.

Edit:  5 of us played 3 games with the Resistance winning overall. It was  surprisingly successful. AFAIK I was the only hobby gamer among us though one of the guys had specifically asked we bring along some board games. I was a bit worried at first that it might not go down well but two days later comments and jokes were still being made. It was good fun and though we were sat in a a bright pub/restaurant with staff walking back and forth we all got engrossed. Very positive result.

BEST played with a large group (only can be played with 5+ though). This is the most intense party game ever. I've never seen more people laughing, more people frustrated, more people playing their roles. I was able to get people who would never role play anything from spies to aliens to completely take on their role as resistance. What a blast.

An excellent game of deduction and paranoia that would be a challenge to play only once in a sitting. That is partly due to it being so short (about 20 minutes), but also because the tension during the game is palpable. I still think that this doesn't entirely replace Werewolf for me, but it does refine what Werewolf sets out to do.

RATING: 8
And I want this one as well...
[update]  This game was really enjoyable.  I love the two different forests and how they are linked together--the concept is great and literary and the game play is pretty fun.  I wish I had the expansion...but realistically it will not get played enough to really warrant it.  Still, it was a fun game that we spread out on the carpet and had fun with for an hour.  I'd like to play it more.  

This game is so pure in its mechanics and simple in its theme--I really love it.  I also like how the different forests are linked together.

RATING: 8
I played this game and it was everything I ever hoped for.  I have the print-and-pay edition, and while I could have spent more time making it look nice, I really just wanted to have it so I could play it... that said, it doesn't look that bad.  

Oh, this game took glorious hours to play, from when my shining knight Sir Parsifal first entered the forest, to when he became King and went to reside in the Castle.  Which was for the best - after over two hours (probably close to three or more) I still had not found the grail!  But when I became King I got a new quest - and one I could easily complete.

And yes, I did play this with the expansion, so the Mystic Wood was huge!

RATING: 5
Yet another game I picked up because I used to play it as a kid.  Though looking back on it, I can see how it was the foundation for many of the games I truly enjoy today.  If you've not played it before, do so if you get the chance.

It is fun, but did not enjoy it at the time when I played it during high school. Would love to play it again with more people. I have played it with only 2-3. Plus the character graphics is a bit PG/adulted rated (I often feels that the artwork is too reviewing on those female drawings), so I have not introduced my kids to it...

RATING: 6
A successor to Sorcerer's Cave.  Not something that I'd want to play to often, and not something that I'd want to play solo but a good like and quick game with the right people.  Not necessarily for the Euro crowd, more like Tales of Arabian Nights.  I'd call it beer and pretzels, but I enjoy it more than many of those beer & pretzel games.  I do like the artwork on the cards, and that you can explain it in 5 minutes.

Probably best with 4 players, because some of the fun is when another player has an item that you need to win, and you have to chase them around to try to get it from them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Amazing little game, with brilliant mechanics! It's easy enough for new gamers. Each character has a predefined goal to win. The game is very replayable because of the modular map. Player interaction is a must (yet the game could be played solo, I guess). Great for those who don't want to throw themselves in a full-blown RPG.

I really like how the game borrows directly from classical literary sources. May on occasion drag on. Graphics are basic but convey the idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A "dungeon crawl" in a wood.  (Much better than its brother "Sorcerer's Cave")

Each player takes the role of a particular night who has to complete a quest (George needs to slay the dragon, Britomart find the prince, etc.)and then leave the wood.  The paths through the wood often end in dead ends or blockages in the direction you wish to travel. Most of the wood is composed of clearings and in these you may find monsters to fight, artifacts to attempt to  obtain, or extra tasks to perform (rescue a damsal, help a lost child.)

All knights are not created equal (it's easiset to win with George), but this is a great little fun game.

Only trouble is the large size of the cards which create the wood (especially if you have the extension kit).  I have made my own copies on blank playing cards which works well.

Splendid game, aged remarkably well. Fairly good setup time, rules not too complex, lots of replay value. The quests given to each character give this a slight edge over Talisman, even if Mystic Wood lacks the production values. The creators of Return Of The Heroes should play this and LEARN!

RATING: 6
A primitive, yet somehow no less thematic, progenitor of the "RPG on a board" tradition continued through by followers such as RETURN OF THE HEROES.  MYSTIC WOOD is very, very simple (barring some antiquated rules and  a few initially confusing cards) yet it features a lot of the qualities that its descendants have elaborated and expanded upon such as pick-up-and-deliver quests, variable outcomes in encounters, and character development.  There are some neat systems in place that were uncommon in 1980 but we take for granted now and as an early exploration/adventure game I think the game acquits itself very well given its age.  A big plus is that it plays in 30-45 minutes.

RATING: 5
I wanted to own this game, because I understood that it was superior to "Sorcerer's Cave". Hmm - While I was lucky enough to score an unpunched copy, it really is almost indentical to SC. 

Oh - it's a fun little game, but you do spend a lot of time getting killed and sent to the tower. There must be some better way to deal with getting trashed in battle. It's a classic question though isn't it? A question about handling player setbacks in an interesting way, while not penalizing him too much or otherwise letting him off of the hook.

Sort of a sequel to Sorcerer's Cave, with an Arthurian theme. Presumably the game that inspired Talisman, though in a number of ways it's actually the better game. Terrible art and low-rent presentation, though.

So so game, I imaging it to be great with kids, but I don't want to go thru the whole process of having kids just to play this game with.  

Its extremely lite, the hidden tile system is nice and there is a sense of exploration as you reveal and search the tiles.  The game is well paced and quick to finish, which is good.  The various knights have different quests and this makes for a little replay-ability, but there are only five with the base game and that won't hold anyone's interest for long.  I can't imaging buying an expensive OOP expansion for just 2 more knights and a few more tiles that adds more of the same. 

On the bright side, the game does give these woods a mystic theme, really feels like you are in a land of fairies and dashing knights, having to save damsels and such.  So in this respect, those with short attention spans (kids and wives (mine anyway)) with some imagination will like this game.

RATING: 7
I bought Terra Mystica then went home and played Mystic Wood with my kids. :-) Mystic Wood is a very light romp through a randomized map where you try to achieve your quest before the other player's achieve theirs - and then get out! The quests involved finding something (by random combos of tiles and cards) - either defeating it or getting it to join you - and then getting out the other side. Very simple. However, why do I like this? It engages both by 11-year-old and my 6-year-old at the same time. They both love it. A game that can appeal to that age difference, in my situation, is a winner. And I don't mind playing it with them at all.

Update: After slogging through Legends of Andor to general indifference for all involved, I appreciate the appeal of this title even more. Upped to a 7!

I had this game long ago as a kid, and wish now (that I have my own kids) that I still had a copy. A fairly light and entertaining fantasy-themed game, with a random map to ensure a high degree of replayability, make for an excellent game offering from an era when Avalon Hill games were often heavy and burdened with 100 page rules books. Highly recommended.

Very much a spiritual sister of Sorcerer's cave. This delivers a more workable play area, as all the cards are arranged in a grid format. Although that does lose the arbitrary fun of SC, it allows for more focus and potential for more interactions with other players. A simple old school game that feels special in my collection.

One of the few games I can persuade Sue to play. Very dated. We've had it since the 1980s. Explore the wood. Acquire items and allies. Fight monsters. Each knight has a unique victory condition, and there are different ways that the various powers and allies can interact.
It has become a family tradition to play this sometime over Christmas each year. It works fine with five players even though the rules say only four.

This is the forefather of many (if not all) fantasy exploring games. If this was a contemporary game (= not more than 25 years old), I would rate it a 4, due to many rule ambiguities, bad artwork and components. A publisher really should pick that up and polish it a bit gameplay-wise and a lot artwork-wise. Could become a hit...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pure and simple adventure, I way prefer this over the sorcerers cave as it has definite quests to complete, the cave is too open ended (some may prefer that and it can be modified to suit). The mystic wood is a charming game and forms an easy going narrative, a super light RPG of sorts.

Have the Ariel version.  Charming little game of exploration of a fantasy forest, very nostalgic.  Easy to learn.  Plays pretty quickly.  Not a masterwork, but I enjoy it, and that's all that matters.

UPDATE - Got a PnP version put together now.  More of the same as Sorcerer's Cave but with a little variation.  Dated game play and components but you have to love these games that kick-started it all back in the day.  Without these old titles you wouldn't have the cool stuff coming from WotC, FFG or FFP, etc.

I got hold of Sorcerer's Cave so don't think I'm missing out on anything by not having this, but I would be intrigued to see it play out all the same.

Excellent, clever, fun and easy game. Better than it's sister game Sorcerer's Cave. The whole Transportation Mechanism and the way you just turn the cards 180 degrees to keep track of bonuses and stuff is brilliant and takes away the need of messy counters. Definitely replayable!

Our game group went through a role-playing boardgame phase where we would alternate between this and Divine Right. Both games are good representations of where gaming was in the early eighties since both games are very thematic and very random. Of course, Divine Right was more involved and took longer to play than this one, but whenever I feel like teleporting back to my youth, these two games take me there.

Pick a knight & off into the Mystic Wood to fulfil your quest. Still good fun, even after all these years. The tiles, cards, and pieces may seem a little bland & uninspiring but the game-play works surprisingly well.

RATING: 9
A fun game that can be played in about 30 minutes. It is very evocative of its source material, the great medieval fantasies "Faerie Queen" and "Orlando Furioso." There is quite a bit of luck involved, but that's not objectionable for a game that is fast and fun. We thought of it as Magic Realm lite.

Our family has been playing this game for over 30 years, with our kids when they were pre-teens, and now with our grandson - and it hit the table again this evening after our (Canadian) Thanksgiving dinner :-)  Our copy has the "extras" added by each daughter - our older daughter wanted  Britomart to quest for a unicorn so I created cards for the unicorn and a second Britomart (back then we didn't even know a expansion existed, and we've never seen a copy of it anyway), while our younger daughter, being a big fan of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain series, created her own "Eilonwy" character whose quest is to "Vanquish the Enchantress"! Talk about taking on a challenge!

RATING: 6.5
Simple, heavily-themed, and fairly fun.  Exploring is a big part of that fun, but getting sent to the tower everytime you lose a combat is not.  Combat needs adjusting, I think - instead of d6 plus your attribute, perhaps it should be 1d4+2 plus your attribute?  Cuts down on the randomness vis a vis your attribute (and that of your opponent).  Original, but I imagine many of today's fantasy games supercede this.

Clearly the predecessor to Return of the Heroes, RotH improves on this game in every way except playtime.  The game is actually very light and fast playing.  The big downside is the Jail, which is really irritating.  With a simple fix for the Jail, the game could be a decent adventure RPG filler.  Overall, while certainly good for its age, there's not a whole lot of reason to play this today.

Good, simple fantasy game. The tiles are a bit like MAGIC REALM&#039;s tiles, but this game can be taught in a few minutes, and has many twists and turns to it. Fun with an active crowd. This is not a BRAIN BURNER by any means, but very entertaining!

This one has a special place in my heart from childhood.  I remember trying to make extra cards for it.  The cool thing about this game is that it is always different and simple to learn.  Small kids can learn it quickly (even 4 year olds).  Simple to set up and lots of variety.  A game can take from 45-90 minutes (closer to 60).  It is possible for some players to get super powerful and get the big advantage, but it is just a light-hearted adventure anyway.

I used to possess this, but it disappeared somewhere. Nice game for young children. However, even as a child I recognised that (like Talisman) as the player characters got stronger, the game got less interesting as the denizens ceased to pose a threat.

Childhood game; lost or sold.

Found it on eBay, having owned it in the 80s. Coming back to it now, I find that it's as good as I remembered, and stands up to repeat play. This is my son's favorite game in my collection.

Played this game as a kid with a friend and his family.  They had various LEGO pieces for the various characters and items, which made it a bit more immersive, and half the fun was the conversations "outside" the game (though usually game related).  Not a brain-burner, but it was fun for what it was.

Can't understand the low rating on this one ... this is a fabulous game with the kids.  We have played this probably more than any other game ... and it all the quests are so well balanced (except Guyon).  It always feels tense when someone is making a dash for the Mystic Gate after completing their quest with everyone else close behind, trying every trick in their book to still eeek out a victory.

The high adventure-game-play-value-to-complexity ratio of Sorcerer's Cave, but in a more reasonable space/time footprint.  Even better for the kids, as you can't get killed.

RATING: 8
A simple, fast-paced, funny fantasy adventure with exploration, character advancement, possibitilty of co-operation/competition, and interesting twists.
A pioneer of RPG-like fantasy board games, an early example of tile-laying and exploring mechanism, a definite recommendation, a must-have classic.
Such a potential! There should be a lot more games like this.

RATING: 6
A mildly attractive adventure In a somewhat homely skin. While not the most visually stimulating product, strategically null, and prone to wild randomness the sense of exploration and fairy tale help to make up for what is lacking. 

Each player becomes a knight on a different kind of quest. They take turns moving to a new randomized tile and flipping it up if it is unexplored. Then, players draw a card, typically revealing some character who must be bested with a dice roll + one of two stats. Each adventure card players complete typically adds to their stats to help offset the randomness. When players locate the object of their quest they must move to a final location to win. I decided to try it with the kids and my daughter, age 6, enjoyed it and even asked to play again.

I would compare it to the lost woods maze in the original Zelda but with the sense of story telling in an early King's Quest game. Certainly worth exploring a few more times.

I rate this game low but it's not a bad game, It's just simple. Would be a great game to introduce younger gamers to board games that include a little bit more decision and planning than say Monopoly or Life.

This game is surprisingly fun.  I like the random hidden tile aspect.  It really feels like you are exploring a new place every game you play.  There is a little bit of strategy as well, but overall a fun light game with a neat theme.  My wife loves it and I think kids would like this one a lot too.  Guess I'll find out a few years from now.  :)

Too much time spent in the Tower, and the luck of the draw often determines who gets to their objective first. I would much rather play Sorcerer's Cave, which doesn't worry so much about being a game and concentrates on providing an entertaining experience.

     A nice little Fantasy game. Cool concept. Seems a little easy to become powerful and thus make the end game much too easy. Over-all a good mix of completing quests, acquiring items, use of spells and NPC's. The game still could use some tweeking though on some of the elements. I have the Avalon Hill version and the rules made me feel like i was reading the rules to Fizbin from Star Trek. (You always do this when encountering this, except when you have this, this or that and only if that isn't present, unless this is there first...ect) I'll have to try the later revisions of the rules, see if they clear anything up. Still a decent game from it's time.

Used to play this quite regularly, but it's been a while now. Exploring the maze is always fun. Has a bit of a rich-get-richer problem, and a strong luck factor. The theme (Medieval/Renaissance epic poetry) is a welcome step away from typical fantasy tropes.

I've had this game a long time and it has been really fun to replay, actually getting more enjoyable as you grow more familiar with the deck and the monsters. 

Some friends have been frustrated on the first play. Don't give up on it, even if you find yourself referring to the book a lot the first time or two.

And sometimes we play with a house rule where you can only stay in the tower so long. It's no fun to be imprisoned in the tower.

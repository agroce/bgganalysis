Good solitaire game with action reminiscent of the Aliens movie - interstellar marines investigate a derelict space ship in a decaying orbit and try to find out why the crew is in bloody, little pieces all over the walls and - WTF is that thing?!?!  Argh, shoot it, shoot it!  Oh my God, it got Mendez!  It got Mendez!  Game over, man...game over...

Not a ton of game here - stick together and blast things, avoid constricts spaces - but fun. The real game here is The Artifact, or so I hope - I solitaired this mainly so I could figure out the system to play the larger game.

RATING: 7
Feel like the Aliens the movie.  There is danger lurking everywhere, making it tense a game.  Intruder seemed too simple, while LF:TVI feels more wargamey--lots rules and exceptions, like 3 different movement rates, and terrain (furniture clutter) modifiers for movement, lots of tables and dice modifiers.

Took me a while to understand the rules.  I don't understand why authors don't show full play examples on a website?  

If you are looking for a more simulation type of squad based game with a little exploration mixed in it this would be it.  Because LF:TVI is about exploration and combat, it is more interesting than a pure combat games like Space Hulk.

BTW the components are not so good.  You get a something that looks like a postcard and you have to cut out around 150+ square counters.  The map (board) looks like a map you would buy at a gas station, very thin, black and white, folded map.  The counters are so postcard thin, it is hard to grab from a flat surface.

Budget solo game with lots of atmosphere. The encounters and random events make this play like a movie. Good game though the rules could be a lot clearer. The ship design is a bit unexciting but then again this is hard sci-fi and is probably just how such a ship would be designed. Forget all that anti-gravity nonsense!

While it shares many of the thematic features of "Aliens," it's not the collapsing trap scenario of "Aliens." What it is is a very intense rescue mission which flows quickly from climatic point to climatic point. The mechanics reminds me of substantially enhanced version of GDW's 70's and 80's games, Asteroid and Snapshot(i.e. the close combat game for the Traveller rpg.)

Hard learning curve. Not difficult or poorly written rule book. Just a ton of things to remember. Everything is a dice roll and consult a chart. Fiddly!

I sat down to play again and realized that I did not want to struggle with rules and relearn the game again. There are so many excellent solo play games I choose to play that I'm not going to waste my time on this one.

Is actually more complicated rules-wise than one first expects, but once you get the hang of it can be really fun. Plays like a mixture between "Aliens" (Leading Edge) and "Intruder" (Task Force Games), but surpasses both games in atmosphere.

Join the UN Colonial Marine Corps in this exciting solitaire game from FMG! Take command of a team of 12 heavily armed Marines as they board a crippled lab ship in a decaying orbit. Rescue the surviving crew, but beware of malevolent alien intruders, escaped lab animals, berserk robots and a sabotaged defense system. Work fast - the controls are smashed and the ship is plummeting towards a fiery end in the atmosphere below. The action is exciting and unpredictable from the minute you dock until the last shuttle blasts out!

I probably should've read the rules before Kickstarting this. This game didn't leave the shelf for years before I finally sat down, determined to slog through the rulebook and play it. 

I can see why some people like it, but having spent more than half of the gametime in the rulebook, consulting charts and looking up again and again what exceptions were applicable this time, I can't say I really enjoyed it. Shame, because I really wanted to like it.

This game really suffers from unnecessary rules and a bad rulebook. Decent flow charts, diagrams and more examples in the rulebook would help a lot.

Great solo microgame!  The random events have a strange tendency to create sci-fi movie moments as several events can work together in funny or disturbing ways.  Rules take a little bit to wrap your head around, but they become clear soon enough.

RATING: N/A
Last Frontier is an older style, dice-and-table driven solo game, which basically resets the story of Aliens (the sequel) on board a space station in a decaying orbit (the game timer).

Players are on a rescue and recover mission, and have a limited number of troops and time to locate or account for lost crew before they hightail it out of the deathtrap station- if there are any left to hightail it out of the station.

There are 2 types of turns in the game, longer turns, where the player has more time to explore and to try to find and recover crew, and shorter combat turns where the player has only a snap amount of time to do one thing, be it move or shoot or grab something.

Getting the feel for the variable turn flow took a couple of turns, but it moved along well once you get the hang of it.

The aliens in the game are not Eiger-esque, but they seem equally lethal to soldiers.

Moving into new spaces is critical to possibly locate and recover crew members, but it is also potentially lethal if the dice do not go your way.

And humans moving alone- crew or marine- have a terrible tendency to vanish into that bag of chits and not return.

The artwork and materials for the new version are really terrific- Print-and-Play is always good, but these truly excel. (Thank you, Andrew!)

I think I need to reconsider my strategies a bit next play, before I give this a preliminary mark.

Let me just say that the game is sufficiently difficult to make winning a real challenge, and losing a strong possibility.

I didn't bother to total up my 1st score, but since I never accounted for more than 6 crew and no space marines survived to make it off the Feynman my total score was quite miserably low and likely negative.

This isn't a short solitaire (unless you manage to get everyone killed or kidnapped before they make it to the ring section), but it is definitely involving and challenging.

The best alien board game I've played so far. It plays really like an alien movie and everything is included what you would expect in such a game. Especially the combats are short and deadly and usually produce quite plausible results.

Maybe a little bit too difficult but otherwise a solitaire game would become boring too fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are few good microgames and this is one of the best.  A challenging but winnable game = good balance.  Some elegance in design makes it all work in a simpler package, for example:  1) drawing random encounter chits creates a different movie every time; and 2) each exploration turn replaces what would otherwise be multiple turns of counter shuffling, a big time-saver.  All the things that you would like to see in this type of story, are there in the rules.  Even a tense and cinematic race to the shuttles at the end as the station comes apart around you.  By the end of the game, you feel like you are playing a movie.  So much replay value.  Docked a point for two, count them two, sets of copious errata.

A nice solitaire gaming concept.  How does it work out?  I am interested.  Andrew Tullsen is going to add the colors with new art to the game in Kickstarter project.  We will see.

A game about space marines attempting to rescue crewmen from an abandoned, aliens-heavily-infested spaceship. Dicerollings have a major part in narrating the story of when and how many aliens in a location. This reminded me of  Space Hulk Death Angel card game much alike.

Sad failure for me. Had this for a long time as the convoluted rules and copious errata kept defeating my interest in the lovingly constructed package.  Unfortunately play did not keep up the interest; seemed ultimately entirely a question of luck whether you get the sequence of killer events that puts you at a disadvantage despite careful play, or not.  I'd rather play Voyage of the Pandora and watch Alien in the background.

This is a great little solo adventure game where you get to poke around an abandoned - well not totally abandoned (hoo-hoo-wha-ha-ha)space station with your trusty marines (who usually become deep, pan, or stir fried one by one) to find the missing crew.  The mechanic of when to check if someone just disappears ("I only turned my back for a second...") adds nice tension.  All the crazy things that can happen by pulling random chits is also a lot of fun.

A totally riveting solitaire game with lashings of both theme and depth. Rather daunting for first time player and definitely on the crunchy side, but the excellent variable turn mechanic makes for a lot of excitement and strategy. Add to this the amazingly low price and it has to be a winner. 

It's just a shame the rulebook makes the game seem more complicated and hard to follow than it should, because that will put off people who would otherwise  really enjoy this. I know I'm very glad I stuck with it.

1st ed: I wanted to love this game. It has a great theme, a very cool map, and some unique rules. But the rules are awkwardly written and overly complex. The two types of turns are an interesting notion, but the related rules are counter-intuitive and difficult to explain. I do like the cooperative element and the solitaire playability. The basic scenario is very difficult, and the alternate scenario is so hard that we only won that once.

2nd ed, deluxe: The deluxe Kickstarter 2nd edition has great components and an improved rulebook. The cardboard tokens have been replaced with scrabble-type tiles, and the black/white paper map is now chipboard and in color.

I love the idea of this game, but the execution is somewhat lacking.  I would have preferred it to be more expensive with better bits, as the very light chits and map slide everywhere.  I'd suggest custom mounting/priting this set if you really like the game.  The Manual is also an un-godly mess, with information all over the place that you have to jump to.  Not intuitive.

All that being said, there is a cool game under all the presentation problems.  Diehard fans will probably love it forever, and it's an excellent solo offering to someone who likes the theme.  The random elements also seem as though they'd add a strong level of replay.

I like playing this. My last session I spread over three nights. The rules are sometimes tough to grasp, but once you get an understanding of the rules, the game (and the marine's blood) flows pretty quickly.

Keep feeling I should have enjoyed this more.  I really liked the theme and the fact that your actions were very related to the story.  Yet, I had a hard time getting into the game.  Rules are a bit fiddly.  Much of your success depends on your dice rolls rather than your decisions.

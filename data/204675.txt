First Play: Watched a review video and read the rule book 3 times prior to first game. I usually get a positive or negative feeling about a game at this point but this time I felt somewhat ambivalent. The rules seems simple but there didn't seem to be much there.

The rule book reads as a clumsy document almost as if first written in German and then translated into English in a rush. The turn of phrase is awkward.

Even after explaining the game, the players knew what to do but winning strategies seemed disjointed. Aiming to encourage the evil goblins to over run the world seemed to position you in a  place which would be disadvantaged by doing this. The route to fame by squashing the pixies seemed more intuitive.

One of the front runners for fame busted the 17 corruption barrier in round 3 to end the game but the goblins swarmed in to give the lowest corruption the win after a tie breaker.

Best to say that the jury is still out on this one. The good news is that anyone could have grabbed the victory, but I'm not sure that the winner got the victory by skill or just by being in the right place at the end.

Curious game where the final board gives no clue as to who won.

The colours are printed really badly - some tactics tiles depict territory colours, but can't guess which one the sky-blue one refers to. Sleeved the cards since I happened to have spare sleeves, and the income cards are thin card, and a bit tricky to shuffle otherwise.

In a 4-player game, the most aggressive player won. One player was trying hard to avoid corruption, but I had heard that the formoni rarely gain the upper hand in a 4-player game (as turned out here).

Played most of a 3-player game (pub closed early after 3 rounds) - the formoni were clearly overrunning us, and I happened to have to have the lowest corruption at that point, but more luck than judgement. Must try this again...

Need to write or get a quick-setup / scoring summary at some point - not easy to find things quickly in the rulebook.

I quite like the income mechanism. I quite like that there are multiple ways of the game ending. I quite like that there are different ways of working out the winner depending on some conditions.

Somehow the game doesn't click for me even with enjoying these ideas.

Far from being a bad game, but something is missing, even though I can't name it.

The game plays much faster than I thought (which is good!) and offers quite some interesting choices, but lacks some depth at the same time. The idea and gameplay is pretty good, but like I said, I'm missing "something" to make it great.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro amb interacció negativa, té mecàniques que m'agraden (hi ha dos tipus de victoria en funció de com cooperin els jugadors) però en general em dona l'impressió de ser massa abstracte.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[b]Update[/b] (after ~4 multi-player games): I really like it. It has a classic feel to it. Simple rules, many possibilities, very direct interaction, just the right amount of luck-of-the-draw that forces you into some tactical decisions; still the better player will win the game. Have played 3- and 4-player. 2-player should work as well. In my Top 10 of 2016.

---
First impressions (based on one third of a 2-player demo game + two thirds of a 3-player game with premature final scoring):

The rules are simple, the possibilities are vast. The main action selection, based on rough ideas/probabilities of what may be on your drafted cards was found interesting by all players. I like this tactical mechanism, you always have to adapt to this rounds situation. No (very) long-term planning possible/required. I can see how some may complain about a luck factor here. Maybe. Playing *order* of your (many) actions seems *very* important, scoring tactic tiles at the right time *within* a round can make or break your scoring.

Player interaction is very high. The Fomori the evil "non-player faction" that are "played" by all opponents don't shy away from decimating your villages and castles in a blink. Sometimes this may even benefit you.

And while the few core actions are very strong mechanism-wise, it does not feel abstract. For being an abstract game, the card-luck/choice and tactical feel would be too high anyway. But I think there is even some identification with your tribe. You want to expand and protect your villages, your shield your regions against the Fomori -- sometimes even "semi-cooperatively" with one or more opponents. And when you throw swords at the creepy creatures, there's a sense of fighting.

Two scoring tracks (typically Martin Wallace?) make the end result -- at least for me -- a mystery until it is finally counted.

I have no complains about the production quality. The artwork is good but has some minor issues. Players colors on the boards could be more obvious. The region colors on the board do not exactly match those on the tiles. And the roads between the locations on the map are clearly the works of a game designer, not a cartographer. Let's say: this won't win any prices for prettiness.

1st Play - 24 Feb 2017 - I've always been partial to a great number of Wallace's games and this one is a pleasant re-skin/tune-up of Mordred.

The resource selection mechanism is novel and with 4P makes for great meta-game in the card-play. I like the streamlined feel to play. Once the rules are real and the Mulligans spotted it's a simple 40 min game for 2 and an hour for 4. It takes a bit to get used to sending the Fomori out to battle instead of head to head conflict but with the tactics tiles this game provides at least three levels of tactical possibilities when planning and I see no reason not to give this another 10+ plays to see if it makes the shelf cut.

Two months ago I found one of my grail games. Mordred.
I played it and and the winning conditions really made it a different game.
This game is a reimplementation of that  I will be awaiting reviews to decide if I need it. But for now it looks like it will be too similar.
If you haven't played mordred check this game out. the winning conditions make it a subtle game and it plays really fast.

Seems like an interesting game (I tend to like games with different winning conditions). Here it is either corruption victory (lowest) if the Fomori conquer Erin, or fame victory if they are defeated. Balancing your progress to a point where you can push the game to either one of these conditions in order to win seems like an interesting challenge. Need to play more to see if it is really viable given competition.
The theme is also quite nicely integrated, which is a plus for me.

Avevo molta speranza per questo gioco, che ho comprato, ma mi è bastata una partita per rivenderlo. Logicamente per un giudizio più profondo dovrei fare altre partite ma per il momento devo bocciarlo. Il gioco a mio avviso è veramente piatto e, perdonatemi, noioso. Scorre via abbastanza veloce e non dura molto, ma ci troviamo a fare le stesse mosse per tutta la partita con pochissima crescita nelle proprie abilità. A me non mi ha divertito per nulla e, anche se ci ho trovato un paio di meccaniche simpatiche non lo vedo proprio tra i finalisti del magnifico.
Però non esageriamo, Mythotopia, era molto peggio

     Very interesting mechanism, thematic with catching atmosphere. At the beginning the map looked a little ‘’empty’’ but the escalation is fast and the game play is beautiful. The play time is ideal and it keeps you on your toes until the last minute.       Very good game!!!

Played this at Essen. It is a reissue of an old Martin Wallace game. It is reasonably easy to teach and learn. The most interesting feature of the game is that there are two parallel scoring grids; you never know which of the two will be the one that counts until you know what the end-game conditions will be, and that may not be clear until the final round.

In contrary to most gamers, I liked Mordred a lot. So when I heard this was a reimplementation of Mordred, I was very enthousiastic. But I found this to be very dull, with 4, I can't see the Formori win. I have to play Mordred again to know for sure, but in my memory the battle between Mordred and King Arthur was far more tense. In our 1 gale we occupied so many cities it was simply impossible to win fir the Formorie, which made it a clear battle for fame points and takes away a lot of charm of the original design.

tl;dr: not breaking new ground

Apparently this game is a redevelopment of [thing=5869][/thing]. I played that game once, but it's been a long time, so I don't remember too much of it. The rules to The Arrival didn't sound familiar though. Doesn't Mordred have dice?
In any case, the way you gain resources is, to my knowledge, unique and cool, and I don't think it was in Mordred at all. But I did enjoy this part of the game.
The rest of the game is a bit of maneuvering on the board and fighting the evil that enters the board from the north. There is some competition over who gets to go where first and who gets to defend first (that gives points of course). This part of the game I didn't find nearly as exciting as the resource generation. It felt way more pedestrian.
There is also a corruption track, and there is a way to win by having the least corruption in stead of the most points. That's called the Fomori victory, but my group didn't see how one could pull that off. To do so lots of Fomori would have to enter the board, but to place lots of them, you will have to gain a lot of corruption, so how then can you have the least corruption? The only big way to lose corruption is to kill Fomori, which would stop that end game condition from happening. I don't know, after this first play this didn't seem like a viable victory condition. I could be wrong though.
But in the end I didn't find this to be Martin's most exciting design of the year, but I guess he didn't set out to design a masterpiece when he made this game either.

Simple actions and rules with meaningful decisions - the only issue I see is the two different win conditions with four players I do not think the corruption would ever come into play there's just to many fortifications being added to the board, maybe with three that wouldn't be an issue. Not having played it with two, I would think that would be the main determining  win condition, while that seems to be an issue with myself, I found the game fun and wanting to play more

Quirky is the best way to describe this area-control-ish, route-building, resource management thing.  I like how you are forced to essentially play both sides of the conflict.

Mi aspettavo molto da quest'ultimo gioco di Wallace ed, una volta provato, sono rimasto parzialmente soddisfatto ; mi è sembrato un buon gioco , solido e che dà molte possibilità per arrivare alla vittoria ; gli manca però quel quid in più quello spunto in più per elevarlo; il gioco fila via ma rimane un po' piatto; comunque promosso

RATING: 7
This was a pleasant surprise for me, having never been exposed to the original "Mordred" version of this game. The resource gathering system is as strange as the box bottom advertised. It's a push your luck system, more or less, where you get to peek at three cards feeding into three resource lots and then you have to guess which of those lots will be best for you without seeing what the last card is going to provide. I've not seen anything like it, so that alone makes it a pretty memorable experience.

The rest of the game is fairly simple, with each player trying to spread his settlements throughout the countryside while a band of monsters descends from the North, trying to destroy the settlements faster than the player's can build them. In another interesting spin, the players control where the monsters strike. As you might guess, that will usually be in an opponent's territory, rather than one's own. There is a price for directing those attacks though and each time a player has to do it, they gain corruption points.

In the last and most genius twist, the players are all working on the two different victory conditions at the same time. Which one will be used to determine the winner however, is unknown at the start and completely determined by the players' collective behavior. If they drive the beasts back, then the player with the most prestige VP's (based on monster kills and territories controlled) will win. If the invaders drive into the player territories and ever outnumber the total amount of settlements in play, than the game ends with the lowest corruption score deciding the winner.

Remember how controlling the monsters gave you corruption? If you use them to trigger the corruption ending, you'll have a hard time winning. If you aren't controlling them at all, you'll have a very low corruption score but your opponent's will absolutely outscore you via territory gains, because you are not sending monsters after them to stop them from spreading and besides, if you aren't putting out more monsters, the monsters will never trigger the lowest corruption victory condition.

It's a fascinating puzzle and one that requires you to jump back and forth between strategies as you try to maneuver yourself into the best position for each end game scenario. It's a very cool game that starts off slow, but by the third turn or so, it coalesces into a delicious bit of move and counter-move for the whole table.

RATING: N/A
Ancient Ireland strategic area control in the face of spreading demons from the Fomori castles.  Managing corruption is central to strategy. Very fun and Interesting four card draw phase of two sided cards that hint the predominant resources on the backs. Simultaneous row elimination yields actions points, tactics tiles, and combat tokens for each round-love this. More resources generally comes at the price of unwanted corruption. Contested areas are resolved against stacked units in a Smallworld like +1 system.  Movement and combat reach are broadened with port-to-port movement and adjacent territory threats. Distinctive game play. I really enjoy how each round flows starting with the row elimination to the select resources culminating with player actions on the board. I like the calculable +1 system to plan and execute conquest. The dual win strategy between fame points or taking the lowest corruption route is great way to escalate the end game tension with two conditions to factor--I would love to see this in more games.

The rulebook for The Arrival is very confusing, and in the end gameplay was a bit weird as well. After spending most turns killing Fomori that I placed on the board myself, I had to gamble in the last round: would someone go over the Corruption limit, or do I need to try for points? After gambling on the latter, it turned out that Corruption would be key and points were worthless.

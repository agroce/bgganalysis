RATING: 5
After 2 plays:
A kids game that it's a little boring for the adults. I would like to try the original Quoridor.

25/9: 3 games with O & T. This is actually a good little game to teach the 5 year old the need for balance between blocking and attacking, and for keeping some options in reserve. In the first game he totally focussed on blocking and left himself way behind but quickly "got it" and began to balance his moves. For the three year old this was just a bit too hard. He loved moving his mouse toward the cheese and putting in his blocks but doesn't have any strategic planning ideas yet.

Quoridor's little brother -- an 8x8 board with eight walls for each player. Pluses: cute little mouse pieces, cheese-colored walls. Minuses: little mouse pieces are hard to put walls near, the board only being 8x8 changes the game quite a bit.

Abstract games get a lot of stick. this one gets a lot of walls. A thoroughly enjoyable, quick playing, kids version of a bigger game.

Great simple to teach easy to learn abstract strategy game. I introduced this to my son who is 6. And his sister who is 5 picked it up and now can play on their own. Better yet my wife likes to play it too and she isn't huge on abstract games. When I began the game with my son I played it easy on him. Now that he's picked up some tricks he doesn't like it when I make it easy on him.
My son loves it because he says "You have to think it...no random stuff!".

This is great. I fully intend to make this his gateway drug into abstract strategy games such as the superb one called Arimaa. Teaching and utlizing critical thinking is a very important thing for minds at any age. Why not start very young!

Juego abstracto disfrazado de juego de niños. Un ratón tiene que llegar al lado opuesto. Las opciones de cada jugador es mover el ratón o poner un obstáculo. Lo probé en Amorebieta 2009.

RATING: 6
Cute components and a game which offers short nut to break both kids and adults alike. Even if you have doubts try this out because it really does not take more than 10 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A solid game, not overly inspiring for me, and not too much different from Quordor from what I recall.  I tend not to take to this style of abstracts, this is not a favouite game, but is certainly not a bad one either.  For kids the graphical choice suits well, and the strategy and skill involved will help lead them onto deeper or more interesting abstracts.

RATING: 8
And the verdict is in...

(The obvious point is it is smaller ~ 7x7 vs 9x9 ~ but that's nothing verdictabibble about it...)

Other than that, it's got a similar challenge.  I'm sure it's a bit simpler, but it will do.   I won't need to get the full size copy as well, but I wouldn't give it back if someone gave me one!   :D

Quoridor Kid. Like its parent, only cute and cuddly... until the kid in question just kills his opponent and gets an evil grin — I mean a big smile — on his face. The edition with the purple board (the one I know) is very nicely produced, even if the colors are a bit loud. And I find that the otherwise useless "cheese" bits do actually help kids understand the game.

Hey, I own the adult version which would play just the same for the kids, but the components are way too cute.  Really attractive to kids.

April 2008, ConVic 7 - first play.  Only 9 ratings?!  Enjoyable "abstract" filler with 'comic' pieces.  Played twice 4-player.  Move your pawn or place a wall are your two actions of choice.  As a filler I give it a solid 7/10.  Could be prone to kingmaking yada yada, but I found it enjoyable.  Probably best as a two-player

Quoridor is a good abstract. I'm not sure it really works as a children's game but well, if it helps them start to enjoy abstract strategies then okay.

2/4 Rated with kids. For a parent vs. child this game sucks bad. There just needs to be somewhat even opponents to get anything out of the game. For child vs. child this is fine and good learning experiences are guaranteed.

Игровое поле содержит всего 7х7 клеток, в отличие от взрослого варианта 9х9, но это делает игру динамичнее, а каждый промах фатальнее.

Propably the most beautiful board game released. :) One of the meanest games. The only difference to the 'adult' version game itself is the smaller grid.

This is a good transition to deeper abstracts for young elementary aged children.  The theme is attractive, but the replayability may not be that great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple abstract game. Nothing childish about the game, excluding the components, this is a pure abstract game and quite mean at it as well. The tricky part is figuring out how to block your opponent while allowing your mouse to advance freely.

Indifferent.

Versione family del gioco Quoridor, la strategia e la profondità rimangono però molto elevate. Gioco che cerca di attirare un pubblico più giovane con forme e colori più invitanti. Rimane un buon gioco.

I really enjoy this game. Much more than the regular version. I like that the grid is only 7x7. It gives it a faster pace. A great abstract game for kids and adults. I have only played it with two players so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Full of surprises! This amazing little game pits your sweet little mouse against your opponents evil mouse! It's simple, all you do is move your mouse or place a stick! If you place a stick you will be trying to block your opponent's evil mouse and thereby creating a corridor that will hopefully delay the mouse's journey to the other side of the board! For such a simple kids game, I have seen some pretty clever plays! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Essentially a 2 player abstract game (but which can be played with 4). Players attempt to be the first to move their mouse to the other side of a 7x7 grid, whilst also spending turns building a maze on the grid to hinder their opponent (and help themself). Victory will be age dominated, but the mouse/maze theme provides a lot of fun and replay, and watching your child learn the tricks on when and how to place fences so as to hurt you and help themselves is rewarding. Each game is over in minutes so you can play a few times to allow them to improve. It's not a traditional kid's game as such, being abstract, but it's one that is aimed at kids with the neat components and one you can enjoy with them.

Fun game with kids, although most wins are decided by some player who himself isn't going to win, but can easily decide who doesn't win either when more than two players are involved. 2 player game is quite tactical and the one who can think further usually wins. A good way to teach kids to think bit further about the consequenses of the moves.

11/11/2007: Tried the 4-player variation once, upon a recommendation from a friend. Found it to be a little chaotic but at least the game involves a lot of tactical planning, which is good.

We played with 4 adults, which turned it to really mean brain burner abstract! With adults, it definetely seems to be best with just two players. With four players, people can srew your plans big time. 

With kids it propably will be played a bit more casual manner and propably works very well too.

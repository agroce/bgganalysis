To the dismay off my Chess teacher, we had much more fun playing this (called "Tandem Schach" around here) than regular chess in chess class. A very different to play, but highly enjoyable team game.

The most fun you can have with your pants on.

Yea, it requires 2 boards, 2 clocks, and 3 other chess players, which means I almost never get to play it.  But I don't factor accessibility into my ratings.

The frenetic pace, the immersive tactics, the belly laughter.  My favorite game.

RATING: N/A
The way to democratise chess. 2 chess boards/sets and 4 players of potentially varying skills play some fun parallel and linked Lightning Chess.

The biggest problem with regular chess is that skill levels vary enormously making it difficult to get a close enough skill match in an opponent to make for an interesting contest. With Transfer you can team up the best and worst players against the two middle-skilled of your group of 4 which, along with the lightning and piece transference makes for a more level playing field.

I have two matched pairs of chess sets specifically to play this - a small cheap pair of magnetic sets to carry (just use one of the cases with the second metal board peeled off its case), and a larger pair of solid plastic Staunton pieces which make a satisfying clunk when moved or deployed.

My first exposure to Chess 960 was also combined with my first exposure to Bughouse.  So technically, I haven't actually played standard Bughouse.

Awesome!

The main downside to Bughouse is that you need 2 chess clocks with working batteries.  Since I only own 1 chess clock, Bughouse only happens when the BGG user Wlaznak brings his "supplies" to a boardgame night.

RATING: 7
Tremendously fun chess variant.  The short time limit per side gives this the feeling that you're always running, so there's not nearly as much time for analysis as a regular chess game.  You just go-go-go all the time; the pace is incredibly fun.  Your chess knowledge will still help you but the chaos can even up the field a little.  There's almost always a cool moment where you have 3-5 pieces in your hand and are trying to figure out how to check-check-check your way to a win, or your position is hanging by a thread and you're trying to hold off just long enough for your opponent to run out of gas and turn it around.  This is the game chess players play to have a break after a long, hard game of chess.  Simply the best chess variant out there; if you want to play 4 player chess, this is the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not sure why this is listed as a game rather than just as a variant for Chess.  However, since it is listed as its own game, I've got to give it a 10.  If I come across people with the temperament (and clocks) to play this, I would drop whatever I was doing to play it.  Some of my best memories from growing up are playing game after game of Bughouse... a knight! a knight! sack your queen for the knight!!  

p.s. this game is much better as a 2-player than a 4-player because you don't have to say what you are trying to get.  Personally, I'd jump at the chance to play all of one side against two players on the other.  Any takers?? :)

I am a avid chess player, chess teacher, chess master and held several national titles. This is a awesome variant of chess, however it was designed to play with 2 chess clocks and 2 chess boards. The game loses its core without the clocks. For online version of this game, (and the strongest players in the world) then try FICS, free internet chess server.

RATING: 7.25
An excellent way to play Chess.  The pressure of the chess clock plus the new options caused by new pieces added to the board make this a fantastic variant for playing a classic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For pure strategic thinky-goodness, this doesn't hold a candle to regular Chess - but Bughouse is fast, furious, fun, somewhat chaotic, and doesn't feel as serious (which can be an advantage in getting it to the table with chess players of disparate ability). Few other games manage to cram as much into 10 minutes. Disadvantages: it needs 4 players rather than 2, and requires owning two chess clocks of reasonable sturdiness.

RATING: 7
What chess players play when they get together. I understand it has garnered a semi-serious set of literature since I gave up the game.

Downside is the limited number of avenues to play. Knights and pawns. I played a lot and don't need to play any more.

Any verison of 5 minute chess is great.  This version is awesome!  (but it has to be played with a clock)

The pace of this game is it major advantage. Chess clocks are a must (5 minutes per side max). Chess masters don't  have the advantage you think they might. Since the openings are less scripted, this is a game for quick thinkers.

I played on a scholastic chess team in 8th and 9th grades, and in the summers, once the season was over, we would play game after game of Bughouse Chess (which we called Siamese Chess).  It was always a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A partnership chess game where the pieces you capture can be placed by your partner on his board.  Chaotic, crazy, fast, and fun - less "serious" than regular chess.  Two chess clocks are needed for OTB play, but the best online play for free is at www.freechess.org, with each team usually having either 3 or 5 minutes total.

For a game that has the feel of two-player bughouse, see [gameid=95915]

RATING: 7
I learned this game as pass chess. I play with these rules: promoted pawns do not turn into another piece (they are just dead when they reach the last row); "check" is not declared (the game ends when a king is taken); you may not place a piece on the board to place the other king in check; you may not place pawns on your own back row; you may not place any of your pieces onto the board on the opponent's back two rows. A couple of clocks are often useful.

I used to play this game a lot, way back when. Game is insane, incredibly intense, incredibly fast. That said, every group I've played with seemed to have their own house rules.
1. Some groups allowed 'place-mates', most did not.
2. Every group seemed to have different ideas about how much communication between players was too much.
3. I've played with 3 on a team, with the left and right players passing into the middle. Middle player either could choose which direction to pass, or had to pass in a prescribed direction (alternating, for example).
4. I've also played with 4 on a team, with pieces passed around in a circle in a single direction -- one team was the outside of the circle, the other team was the inner circle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great way to make up for one crappy chess player in a four player group.  I tried this variant with three friends that are chess fanatics.  I know how to play but I am not very experienced.  I did a lot better with the best player handing me pieces all game!  They did not call it bughouse chess, but I am fairly sure this was the same variant.  Lots of fun, a nice way to spice up generic chess and make it work for four players.

Very cool variant, another fav now with Shogi and Chinese. Playing 2 boards is great, especially when you can use the captured pieces on the other board (kinda like Shogi). This will magnify the difference between a good and bad opponent I believe making it a runaway game for the stronger of the two, great fun though

RATING: 7
Fun chess variant if you have four people.  It must be played with with chess clocks under blitz conditions to prevent someone losing his game from waiting for help from his partner.  Ultimately less satisfying than pure chess as victories feel like they are determined more chaotically and were not "earned" in quite the same way.

This is one of the most fun and social chess variants.  It's almost the antithesis of chess---fast action over deliberation, instinct over planning, yelling at your teammate over politeness.  It's great fun for people who think that chess is too quiet and serious, although you do need to find four people.  Good times.

Bughouse is not a "serious" abstract, but it is wild fun and not without tactics. Kibitzing is in the spirit of the game.

Players who worry that variants will take the shine off their orthodox game will shut their eyes and flee at the first sign of Bughouse. That concern undervalues creative thinking -- the very thing for which great chess players are remembered.

This was a hit in chess club.

As a fan of chess and regular player when I was younger, this is a common game seen at Tournaments and club meetings, to spice up regular games.  Unlike regular Speedchess and other variants, this variant really is just for fun, and doesn't help develop any particular skills, and is really only good for morale.  It's a way to get groups of players together with potentially unbalanced skill levels and through team combinations "balance" the playing field.  It is also commonly known as "bunkhouse" as well.  Although the description only refers to two boards, it can easily be expanded to many players (I've played in games with 9 boards before).  However, once you expand beyond 2, it's best to play with an odd number of sets (3, 5, etc.).  This way you may have one central "primary" board, and regardless of what happens with the rest of the games, the only one that matters is the center board.  This adds interesting twists because as long as you alternate colors from board to board, you can still share pieces but it can get hectic as one guy from one end of the table screams for a "knight" across the table.  You can also introduce rules about only passing pieces to certain boards or in a certain direction.  Another variant is to have all boards feed to the center board instead.  Another reason I like the 3-board setup as optimal is you might not have enough clocks -- and may only have one clock, but the central board is the only one that really needs the clock.  All around lots of fun for groups, but again, not much in the way of lessons to be learned (other than appreciating the power of the pawn).

Partnership chess played with two chess sets and two clocks. Teams are on the same side of the table, you play one color, partner plays another color. Captured pieces are sent to your partner who may later plunk the piece onto the board as a move. Growing up in Kingston, Ontario, this was called "double chess", I'm not sure where the origin of the name "bughouse" comes from. With 6 players, we sometimes played "triple chess" and quite often with 8 players, we played "quadruple chess". Usually played at parties, games are quite quick and we spent countless evenings playing the night away. Lots of fun when your partner(s) are calling for pieces they need, or you need pieces from them. Great tension when your king or opponent's king gets "smoked out". Throw in the added time pressure and it's great fun. You need clocks to play otherwise someone will wait it out until they get a piece that they need. Lots of strategy, such as do you sacrifice a bishop on f7 of your opponent's square to smoke out their king, if you are a victim of that move, do you not use your king to capture, but move it one space sideways, etc. Too bad only one person in my gaming group enjoys chess. As a game, would be classified as a filler, but you can play as many games as you want, and substitute other people in if they are waiting to play.

This is fun - pure recreation at the end of a long tournament. I have happy memories of playing "Transfer" in the basement at the Monash Student Union, and again with IMs at the Melbourne Chess Club. A crazy classic. Essential that teams are balanced, but it is fine with two good opponents and two average players.

Chess to the next level. You must pay as a team as one game lost means the team loses. Thus time and passing of pieces between the players is so important and can win or lose a game. More complex then chess since extra pieces can be added anywhere, but additional pieces are always visible and can be planned for. I'd say it is more fun then chess due to the ever changing play.

Four players, two boards, two clocks, and then the controlled chaos begins.  Hyper pace, piece placements, and unbalanced sacrifices to get specific pieces . . .

Fun, fast, and allows for some different ways to balance different [gameid=171] skill levels.  I prefer this to Chess for fast, friendly games because of the wide variability that allows players of widely different skills to compete more fairly.  Strategy is wildly different and less focused, but tactics are a bit richer.  Requires two clocks and sets, which is often difficult for me to get together.  Very, VERY different feel from Chess itself, but retains many of the best parts of its classic forbear.

One of my gaming group's "cabin" games that sees a mini tournament every year. Played this a lot in my post secondary career.

I've upgraded to 2 Omega chess (the neoprene 10x10 board and pieces) sets and 2 chess timers this game sees this much play. Wouldn't recommend this game if you're serious about chess but I'd put this up alongside any other game experience I've had. Put some money and betting on the line and the amount of wonderful gaming stress is just bonkers. Open this up to multiple teams with multiple tables and it's an incredible high that is hard to replicate in board gaming.

A great racing game which offers a good amount of control and options.  Comes with some great components packed in a somewhat oversized box.  Gamelay goes by fast with players being routinely asked to balance their need for speed against maneuverability.  Overall, a very fun racing game which embraces its theme, allowing it to play and feel slightly similar to its console racing-fighting brethren.

RATING: 6
A very hectic race game for those that like a little more conflict in their race games!

While the goal is to finish the race in first place, there is also the goal of knocking other players out of the race!  Of course you'll beat any other players that are simply unable to finish!

Movement is fairly simple; you decide how much to shift at the beginning of your turn, losing various resources for doing more than the minimum amount of shifting.  Your car also risks overheating and also is harder to steer the faster you go, so you must always keep an eye on both how far you need to go as well as how hard you can push your car until the whole thing blows up!

In the end, I liked it enough, but get a little annoyed at having to track various special abilities and the dice rolls involved in resolving them.  I suspect this would get easier with more play though.

Fantastic theme, but a little too procedurally tied down to really unleash the rollicking fun you would expect from a game of this nature. Possibly with several replays, players would know the rules so well that it would flow more quickly, but at least for me it would have lost its charm with that much play.

Some players will be turned off by the large role of luck, but I can live with that. 

Biggest plus is that its very possible, even likely, that some cars will be destroyed before finishing the race. I found that made everything more interesting.

I'd be willing to play again, but probably not request or purchase this one.

It is an uneventful racing game. If I want to race I will always choose Formula D, Missippi Queen over this game.

I played it once and never had a desire to go back to it.

¡Important Point!
Unless your child is who you bought this game for, simply throw the "Arcade" rules away. They take out little in terms of "difficult" content and fill the vacuum with the worst, Saturday-morning narration of all time. In fact, even if this is for your kids, still throw those rules away and sit down with them to explain the longer, better rules set.

Only played a 2p game so far and only short-length races, but even still, the game's mechanics made for an exciting duel as our cars were slowly whittled away by gunfire and impacts. I can only suspect that this game will get better with the addition of more people and more laps (which will both up the level of concern for everyone).

A very fun racing game that is out of print.  Plays like a boardgame version of the wipeout or f-zero video games.  The cars need some customization to make it more playable as they are too small and fiddly without being glued together with a stand underneath.

This little board shows you how many spaces you are allowed to drive forward per turn. I also keeps track of your heat checks (what color band you're in) and your steering checks (die icon on the right hand side). The steering checks is where it gets really interesting. As your speed increases (number gets larger) you have less ability to steer. At low speeds you roll the number of dice and take the highest number. When you're going fast you roll the dice but this time you take the lowest number. It is very clever!"

Nice combative racing game.  You get chain guns, flamers, mines, rams, etc. to trash your opponents.  Manueverability is limited by dice and dice are limited by your speed/gear selected.  You end up having to manage steering, brakes, heat, nitros, while trying to weave through the obstacles and hopefully damage your opponents.  I'd definitely play this again if offered the chance.  Loosely based in the AT-43 universe, though you need no knowledge to enjoy or understand the game.

Absolutely unbelievable. why bother with Formula De, when you can get much more simple fun, and shoot the competition while you are at it! shame scale is so small thou, the cars fall apart every other time you pick them up...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only works if everyone plays aggressively and is willing to take risks--otherwise the thing is dull, procedural, and decided by the second or third turn.
When it works, the fact that speed is deterministic means that you know what risks you need to take to pass the leader--which means that dice wield too much power. Failing that, no one becomes willing to pass, so it's far too hard to unseat the early leader. Close to working really well, RnC kind of falls flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this works best with 5 or 6 players. With less it can tend more towards the racing element. With 5 or 6 it seems pretty balanced between people losing by going to slow and losing by getting blown up. Compared to Formula De, there is more player chaos. You have a bit less control over the outcome because if someone wants you dead, they can pretty much kill you, if at great personal cost. In that regard, it's probably not as strategic of a game as Formula De, which makes me enjoy it a little less. Then again, it's awfully satisfying to ram someone into a well at 160MPH after shooting them with a machine gun. Ratatatata!

Pretty fun ameritrash racing game.
Artwork & theme is rather good, reminds me of some older computer games i played.
The teamplay sounds awesome, but the downtime might become a problem with 4-6 players.
Also be aware that this game has a !lot! of dice rolling.. so you should be fine with that.

The fighting & shooting works well (roll lots of dice), not sure about the racing part because there is very little randomness, you don't play cards you simply decide how far you wanna go, might be to deterministic to invoke a race-feel.

A fine game that has instantly taken over the "racing combat" niche. Take Formula-D, add a modular board, add more acceleration/braking options, and a lot of nasty player interaction with shootings, mine laying and ramming.

It's also quite aggressive, and you can push your luck to astronomical levels. Usually the winner is the last car standing.

This game should be a 10. Unfortunately, loses 2 points because of the mediocre production work.

Yes, having this, there's no need to play Formula D anymore.

Formula D with guns, not to mention flamethrowers, mines and plain old ramming. The track is mostly too wide for weapons to have much effect, so include some narrow sections (like the one lane bridge) to force competitors to bunch up. Everything is die rolling, so you can estimate risk, but luck can decide the race. There's plenty of fun here and unlike Formula D it proceeds at sufficient pace to avoid dullness creeping in.

This game is probably better than I think it is, since the person who taught it hadn't played for a while and the rules were rather opaque.  It did seem a bit convoluted for a racecar game.  It provided lots of opportunities to crash, but nobody really seemed to, since we kept rolling lots of lane changes on the dice.  I think there's more to get out of this than I did, but since I'm not a big fan of the genre, I'm not particularly inclined to explore it further. (1 play)

Lots of fun, but wish dice values were a bit more consistent as it can be a pain trying to remember if a high value is good, or you should be rolling 4+ or just 1 or 2's, etc. Reference sheet helps, but still fiddly in this regard. Also has a runaway leader problem, so had to introduce house rule for needing to go at reduced speeds around corners.

Unhappy with the little plastic cars, the pieces don't fit well together and I hate being FORCED to modify pieces to play, like glueing.  Otherwise it's an interesting mechanic, but suffers if the cars get spread out too much.  All of the weapons are close quarters weapons, and the game desperately needs longer range ways to mess with a leader that pulls too far away.  Think the bomb guy from mariokart, homes in on first place and hits with near 100% accuracy.

Initial Rating: 3.0 (May 2016)

I should begin by saying that I absolutely hate racing in any form. I hate watching it or playing it (I only enjoy racing if I’m the one doing the driving :D), so it is no wonder I heavily dislike Rush n' Crush. If I get my way, I won’t ever play it again.

The theme is awesome and I enjoy it, but that’s all I enjoy from the game. The game components and art are from ok to good. Teaching the game seems very hard due to the rulebook. A friend read it and explained the game, but he made some mistakes. He says the rulebook is a mess. I saw the rulebook and it is very thick for such a simple game, so perhaps it does have lots of rules, if that’s the case, perhaps it is overly complex for its intended public. 

Gameplay is very slow, with lots of boring checks and procedures. Its play time is way too long for what the game offers. In general, Rush n' Crush is very boring and procedural for me. In my only play we knew who will win way before the game ended. It seems the first players have an unfair advantage. 

The game has lots of uncontrollable luck.

I think fans of racing will enjoy the shifting/overheating system, but it was very boring for me 

Bottom line, Rush n' Crush is way too long (I know you can make the game shorter using less track tiles). It has some interesting ideas, but I find it boring, procedural and repetitive. Perhaps Road Kill Rally is a better game, but I dislike both of them.

Think of this as similar to Formula D, but the gear mechanic is different.  I actually like it.  As you increase your speed, the number of turns you are likely to get is reduced or at least the odds are reduced.  So lets say you gear up to move 16 spaces, it is very possible you are only going to get 1 turn during those spaces.  SO you have to make your decisions on what gear to be in based on what is ahead of you.  In addition to being a driving game, your opponents are attacking you with guns, bumping you, dropping mines.  A fun game and it is pretty quick to play

There are 10 reversible tiles, so you can build many different tracks, you choose how long and difficult the track will be.
Can be great fun if you battle the others, but if you just play it like a racing game there exist other games that are better.

after a video review

Seem interesting. I am also an F-Zero fan, so I really want to try this game. Not sure I am going to buy it because weapons are essential to win the game and I would have preferred a game with no weapon, but I want at least to give it a try.

From what I have heard, there is a strong leader bashing syndrome in this game.

I have mixed feelings about this game so far.

While it has much less luck that it's cousin Formula De, there is still a significant level of luck in the lane changes. 

The big positive is that your speed is dictated by your position. This is coupled with the fact that you choose your level of risk in terms of lane changes associated with your given speed. You also have quite a few more points to augment speed, shifts, and changes than it's cousin, though this is somewhat deceiving as one major blunder can leave you hurting and basically remove you from contention.

I'm still interested in playing more and those plays will either confirm or deny my feelings.

Finally: Why the hell couldn't there be either multicolored cars OR cars that you can intermix colored components that ACTUALLY STAY TOGETHER? I know the colors are teams, but this isn't really a team game.

Feelings confirmed: Random mess with a runaway leader issue.

Racing games are a somewhat overcrowded niche, even when you add some tougher road rules to the mix. Apart from nice and slick graphics, the main new innovation of Rush’n’Crush is the gear shift mechanic that manages to put speed, handling and enging overheating into a single appealing package. Since everything apart from this central idea is also good or at least serviceable, this is a game I’d like to revisit, particularly because our testing match was with only two players.

Futuristic racing game set in the (defunct) AT-43 universe. You have to balance speed, heat and damage to make it through without your car bursting into flames or exploding. Some excellent use of dice here as your speed increases. Can be tense and exciting as you drive by the seat of your pants.
The consulting of charts for collisions slows down an otherwise nippy game; between the two rule books there's a great game, I might compile my own version of the rules balancing flow and complexity.

Really wish this were a better game. The racing mechanics are different from the more popular car racing games - maybe too diffrent, and so it doesn't feel like you're driving a car, because the emphasis is on trying to get more turns instead of speed. Some great ideas with what the weapons do to the cars (heat, car damage, and such), and how they come to play in the game, but ultimately it just doesn't feel like what it's supposed to feel like.

Got on a great sale at Miniature Market.  I do not have much experience with racing games, so I figured this would be a good introduction.  Not having other games in the genera to compare to, I can say that playing it is fun...and can be rather mean.  Staying alive can be challenging unless you really are being careful, but if you are being careful then you are not winning most of the time.  The most irritating thing about the game, however, is the language of the arcade rulebook....oh my, it took me forever to get past the ludicrous language which was written for flavor instead of clarity.

We played one lap, so we basically just went all out, but none of us would have lasted a second lap, which is the regular way to play. As you go faster, you can steer less (change lanes) and your car overheats, but you can also hit others. Lots of fun!

The rules for this game were so poorly organized that many of the people I was playing with gave up on the game.  A player aid to explain sequence of play as well as the confusing iconography would have been a big plus.  I don't think the game is really that complicated, but the rules paint it that way.  The components are not great either, the plastic cars are too small and easily fall apart.  Oh, and the box insert is ridiculous, it only serves to take up space.

--Jun2010-- It's an amusing race game in concept, though perhaps a bit less amusing in practice.  It seemed similar to a simplified Formula D(é) with a few vaguely-reminiscent-of Car Wars attack options.  In our game, there weren't many choices other than "Go Faster!" and the attack options weren't that relevant.  So the game came down to how many free lane-changes one rolled - which isn't quite as delightful as one might hope.  In the end, I'd rather play another race game:  Daytona 500, Formula Motor Racing, Powerboats, Mississippi Queen, Snow Tails, even Street Illegal ahead of this one.

Great play with teams and long tracks.  With 12 or more segments this game is an excellent play.

Great racing game that makes Formula De near obsolete.  The movement is great and the weapons are fun.

I like the shifting/overheating system.

There's quite a bit of overhead to knowing all of the little special rules, but it pays off.  Once you get it all it plays quick.

APers will take too long though, I recommend my classic Formula De fix which is you can count out your car movement once then you can move your car (choosing either the path you took or a new path). This will cut down on over analysis.  It's supposed to be a racing game, yo!

I like racing games, and I would have thought I would love destroying other racers, but there are several numbers involved in the destruction that you have to try to remember, and there doesn't seem to be a set scale to decide which damage hits.  This means you are forced to open the rulebook every time you want to destroy someone.  It's just really annoying for me, and takes the fun out of the "advanced" version, which is the one I would be interested in playing.

Not a fan of racing games in general. This game has a cool gear shifting mechanism, but boils down to getting a lucky die for the number of lane changes. Also, the game has a "catch the leader" mechanism, that makes it impossible to get out of the "pick on" spot once you're there.

Fast paced, nice mix of racing and combat. Rules are clunky at first, but we're getting the hang of them fast. Rulebook is confusing written, with several errors, inconsistencies, and terrible terminology choices. Really should have included reference sheets, and I'm not happy with the cars models; 6 different colors would have been a better choice.
Playing with a straight as the first section helps minimize the importance of starting turn order, but it can still hurt to start in a later position. Hard to catch up to a leader; lucky rolls really decide this game.

House rules (for Overdrive):

* Do not use activation markers - you can use 2 pieces of equipment per turn, and cannot use the Fire Extinuigher and Turbo in the same turn.

* The Turbo gives you 1 heat and moves you a number of spaces up to your place in the race before turboing (ie: 4th places = up to 4 spaces).

* Crashes roll the dice as indicated, but only do half the rolled amount (D3).

* If you end your turn in a gear with white dice, regain 1 point of stats (turbo/handling/brakes) per white die.

We all thought better than Formula De (even the big FD fan!)

This is a little big game... I'm a huge Formula De fan, and this one works really nice on changing the "random" part from the movement (speed) to the lane changes capacity.

This is a great game which needs no expansions to be awesome.

First the players choose a driver from among six armed and dangerous psychopaths. They hop aboard futuristic, armoured and over-equipped vehicles. And the race begins. The goal is to be the first across the finish line, as only first place counts. No matter the game mode used, Arcade or Overdrive, the race is always a deadly obstacle course around a track made of ten reversible tiles, which can be assembled to build many different racetracks. Fire your engines, buckle your helmet, and be ready for the armed racing game!

This game is almost what I wanted Formula D to be. The modular board means both that you don't need to buy a ton of expansions to keep the tracks fresh and that the game length is extremely variable. Having dice determine lane changes rather than speed seems to mitigate the runaway leader problem. Having weapons increases interaction significantly, and having asymmetrical weapons makes things even more interesting.

The one time I've played as of this writing, the person who won also had the best die rolls - then again, he also took the biggest risks, so I'm not sure which was the bigger factor (or if they both contributed). I also gave Formula D an 8 after my first play, which dropped to a 6 after three subsequent games, so while I don't expect my rating to rise much for this, it may fall.

Still, my impression right now is that this is a really fun-to-play game. The atmosphere was similar to Galaxy Trucker in that people found it amusing to see their car blasted to bits. I suspect there'd be a lot of overlap in the fan bases for those two games.

Very enjoyable weapon- and brawl-based car racing game. For a racing game, it first felt weird that the game has no mechanisms whatsoever for curves or bends - the bends are just cosmetics: mechanisms-wise, they might as just well have been straights.

But it was soon obvious that going smoothly through a curve was so far from the point of this game that it was simply omitted - instead, what you do is try to zig-zag to avoid obstacles in the road, and ram, shoot or flame your opponents. And in those terms, the game succees tremendously.

Dice controls how much your car can change lanes, how much your energy overheats, and how much damage you do when attacking - but all rolls can be mitigated, depending on distance, speed and how much you accelerate, so it's a toying with probabilities, which result in a lot of excitement as the dice are rolled.

(That said, personally, the game would have gained quite a bit if the bends had been designed so that you need to do a lot of lane changes to the right in order to take a right bend. But it's a minor peeve.)

Has a push your luck feel that often has the leaders fighting to maintain not only position but also survival, due to the other opponents, the vehicles condition, & the deadliness of the track itself. 

Instead of movement dice the game uses an original & unique gear change mechanic, plus a simple On/Off weapon activation system.

The speed & physics make it far superior to any 'Roll & Move' racer out there; The faster you go the less lane changes you may get.

Rush 'n' Crush blows the piss out of Formula D and Road Kill Rally. If you can't handle the speed, fit [BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF][COLOR=#FF3300][b]L[/b][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] plates and look there!

Thematically rich game that feels like a great balance between interesting mechanics and insane dice-triggered weapons. A solid racing/fighting game.

An interesting "hidden movement" game, one that required many sessions to uncover all the strategies and tactics involved in successfully playing it.  Loved it both as Garibaldi and as the Austrians.  With two people, I'd take either side (Garibaldi or the Austrians) with equal enthusiasm!

There really isn't that much to the game -- basic movement choices, basic search attempts -- and then lots of "deductive reasoning" detective work to find your quarry (or evade your potential-captors!).

Well-done.  Definitely recommend playing it with two persons.  Slows down significantly with more players.

RATING: 6.5
For fans of Scotland Yard, this is a nice variation on the original.  If you are a fan of the historical characters the game depicts - it is also a nice touch.  Game quality is top-notch and the game play is as smooth as expected.  The game seems to be slightly in favor of the chasers (where as Scotland Yard seems to slightly favor Mr X.).  All-in-all, a nice take on a classic and enjoyable game design.

RATING: 7
A good Scotland Yard variant that's halfway between Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula in complexity. Think Fury of Dracula without the combat. The Austrians can lose the trail quite easily but it's very hard for Garibaldi if they just stall the game out. Also the 2 events that don't get discarded seem quite harsh for the Garibaldi player - especially when the Austrians can continually discard to cycle the deck to ensure that they always have them in hand.

Only a few plays, but Garibaldi is great! We like the "catch me if you can" games, and this one is lots of fun. The game bits are superb: high quality, attractive, and the board is a retro looking map of the Ravenna, Italy area where this historical event took place.

BTW: Garibaldi actually did escape from the Austrians, with lots of help from local citizens!

This is a nice game, a re-themed Scotland Yard. The components are of excellent quality and evoke period feel. All in all, I find it better than the original, as it makes more sense thematically and the card-driven nature of the game is a vast improvement. And it is surprisingly good as a 2-player game, probably even best with two.

Not bad, clean playing, but if the Austrians lose the scent they can be wandering aimlessly. Seems like a track where the Austrians can record what types of moves Garibaldi has made would be nice, otherwise it seems like they are just making wild guesses a little too often. A little information would be nice. Possibly best 2-player.

Still, fun, not too long, and clean.

A game of hide-and-seek; one versus the rest. Probably more fun for the Garibaldi character and better with 2 or 3 players to give the searchers more to do. The events for the Austrian players seem fairly ineffective - make Garibaldi discard three cards - he still keeps the one he needs for next turn and then draws a new handful. I've played six times and always caught my man (or been caught). Overall, not bad, similar to Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula.

What a fantastic game! If you like Scotland Yard or just solid deduction games, then you must try Garibaldi. It obviously shares a lot with Scotland Yard, but it is significantly different to be worth getting as well. The big difference is the reveal mechanism, by which the Garibaldi player must drop markers on the map if the Austrian patrols are standing anywhere he's been IN THE LAST FOUR TURNS! Oh boy oh boy oh boy, was that hard! It feels like a great mechanism, they just need a scent to pick up your trail and then they are onto you. And the map is very narrow, the five patrols can just about cover it. I was caught just before the border, it was a last gasp dash for freedom, but the Austrians stumbled onto me, after I'd just dodged them earlier and bamboozled them for the whole game. 

This game was soooo intense, a real strain on my nerves. The players all have Events they can use, and the Austrian events basically forced me to lose cards or reveal a trace, and since I didn't want to give them a clue, I was repeatedly stuck for choice, and thrice had to stand still whilst they moved around me. Garibaldi is really outnumbered, but I didn't feel the game was unbalanced. It's very tough to win as Garibaldi I think, but do-able. Don't assume this a Scotland Yard clone, it's a herring of a very different colour.

Some tightening of the rules around how the Austrians turns go, and whether they can swap info would help, but otherwise, this is a hit.

*** Played twice again, this time making sure that the Austrians gave up a movement when doing an action. The first game we caught Paul early on when he stumbled onto us! The second game Mike was traced on his second turn but then hid around the start area (amongst the traces) and managed to give us the slip. We were convinced we had him, and at one point he nearly walked onto us he said, but when we realised we'd lost him, we tracked back up to the north marshes and then he raced along the coast. Only the events giving him extra moves got him to the border and he escaped! Again, a very intense game, and the table talk and logic is great fun, but a very different feel to Scotland Yard. *** Won as Garibaldi!! Hoorah, it is a hard game.

RATING: 7.25
Fury Of Dracula-lite.  We played twice in one night: in game 1, we found Garibaldi on round 2.  In the second game, he went off the board on round 25.  If the Austrian patrols go through their event cards too quickly, they can become a bit bogged down in the last third of the game or so.

Really interesting cat and mouse game. Garibaldi certainly has a tough time trying to escape, but I can see the reward for the player who is cuning enough to fool the austrians...

Beautifully themed game in the NY Chase genre.  Unfortunately, once you realize you have no idea where Garibaldi is on the Austrian side, it becomes a bit of a stale guessing game.  I suspect that it is engaging for Garibaldi throughout.  However, the use of history bundled nicely with game play, means that this game will has a place in my collection.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A surprise at Essen, this simple Scotland Yard-like game was actually quite fun. One player represents Garibaldi who is trying to escape the map without being caught by Austrian patrols. Players play cards to move along one of three different kind of connecting lines (or alternatively, play cards for events). The Austrians get clues to Garibaldi's whereabouts if they enter a location Garibaldi has visited within the last four turns, and since they're also able to see the kind of movement Garibaldi makes each turn (foot/horse/boat), it doesn't take long for the Austrians to begin to make qualified guesses. Time pressure is on Garibaldi who has to escape the map within 30 turns.

Garibaldi is not really my 'kind' of game, but that being said I enjoyed my experience with it much more than expected. The designer was very helpful, and obviously passionate about the subject (which, we were told, is one that all Italians learn about in school). The artwork is based on old paintings and the map is a historical one with point-to-point info overlaid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Impression after 2 games:
Garibaldi is inferior to Fury of Dracula.
It is also has a critical flaw in a 5 player game:

- The Austrians keep the Garibaldi events in their hands as long as possible, thus denying Garibaldi his event cards.

- The Austrians discard as many of their cards as possible to keep cycling the deck. As the only event cards that are recycled are the ones for the Austrians, they will be able to play these events every other turn.
At least one of the events is "discard 3 cards at random or disclose one of your locations." This wil remove any kind of planning Garibaldi can make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice asymetric game, one player as Garibaldi makes hidden moves while trying to evade capture and escape, while the others cooperate in trying to capture Garibaldi in a similar manner to Scotland Yard. The game purist may prefer Scotland Yard, but I feel Garibaldi has more colour.

This is a very strong 6 for me. It is just so similar to other games, in particular Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula. I love Fury so much that when I'm playing Garibaldi I just miss all of the awesome mechanics that Fury has.

The up side is that Garibaldi only takes 30-60 minutes to play. So it serves a very different purpose than Fury does, though not much different than Scotland yard. 

I like the game, it has a unique feel and can lead to some very interesting decisions. We've found playing Garibaldi to be very difficult, with only two successes over 6 games. I think we're probably pushing too hard for the goals too early and more deception and misdirection is needed.

The game can also lack tension for the Austrians. Garibaldi gets to experience all the close calls and tense moments but the other players generally have no idea and the game isn't as exciting for them.

An interesting game, and I have to respect it for the nice cover art and fidelity to an interesting historical event that is not a battle or war.

That said, the game is very abstract and probably is the most fun for the person playing Garibaldi, as it can be very frustrating for the troops trying to hunt him down.  I'm not sure if I really understand how to play that side well yet, as it seems like you're just taking stabs in the dark hoping to get lucky.  In Battleship you can see where you've already gone, thus eliminating possibilities as time goes on.  But unless your memory is extraordinary, it's pretty hard to be able to remember what types of transportation Garibaldi used five turns ago.

RATING: 7
Naturally, this must be compared to Letters from White Chapel.  They share a lot, if only in the objectives and feel of the game.
I like the event cards and also the way that using the cards for movement simulates actual overland, water or highway movement. But the cards make it a bit more fiddly.
     If you can't find a trace of Garibaldi and really get the hunt started, the game bogs down and gets boring for the Austrian guard players.  It appears that there may be need to house rule a trace token sooner than round eight.

RATING: 7
Nice, but Letters from Whitechapel effectively put this in retirement
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game has many similarities with Letters to Whitechapel - the one hidden-movement player against the (potentially) many open-movement players, but lacks its simplicity and streamlined play. 

The more generic weakness of this game is that an Austrian patrol must end its move on the location of Garibaldi for him to be captured. This may happen almost by chance, and even with a deliberate move, there is something about it that feels like threading a needle while wearing mittens.

Conversely, Garibaldi must always be cautious about moving to a location 1 or 2 steps from an Austrian patrol, particularly if it is in the general direction of movement of that patrol. This means that doubling back to confuse the Austrians may easily be fatal almost by accident. Which may be how Garibaldi viewed the world, but I feel the game suffers from this syndrome of accidental sudden death.

The game also suffers from a certain samey-ness in that there seems to be an optimal strategy for the Austrians - move the closest patrols quickly to the coast to pick up the trail, and organise the more distant ones to provide a screen about half-way across the board.

A specific weakness is that starting locations for Garibaldi near the eastern edge of the board can be quickly fatal if the Austrian player located furthest east systematically moves swiftly south-east to see if the trail can be located in the first couple of moves. Starting locations nearer the west give Garibaldi a far greater chance of winning.

I find the cards add little to the interest of the game, and the rules are silent about whether Garibaldi may immediately draw fresh cards if an Austrian event card causes him to discard. I imagine that the intent is that he loses that many cards from his hand until his next turn, which may mean that he holds none at the start of his turn and cannot move or act, before making his hand up again at the end of his turn.

A beautiful game, without much replayability, and somehow lacking much of the interest of Whitechapel.

It is very easy to set up, learn and play.  However, I would much more prefer to play Fury of Dracula as that game is far more exciting.  Of course, my first and only game thus far was only about 5 turns long as we found Garibaldi quickly thanks to having a couple nice event cards that really constrained Garibaldi.  Of course, FoD takes about 2x as long to play at least and is far more fiddly in both bits and rules.

Sort of "alternative Scotland Yard" (and thus MUCH lighter than "Fury of Dracula"). It lacks variety (as the Austrians you do the same simple thing over and over: play a card to move your pawn in one of three ways - horse, feet or boat). The Austrian Events are mostly useless; I suspect Garibaldi has a few more interesting choices to do (and more useful events). I wonder if a strategy can really be planned or if it is mostly "let's hope to bump into him".
Quick and simple (thus probably good for families and casual gamers).

Interesting little game. I agree with other reviewers – easy to learn, some depth and replayability. It gets a lower rating mainly because it’s really a 2 player game. More players makes it co-op that suffers from quarterbacking. I like the optional rules at end for different hand sizes for different players. 

The cards were a bit annoying being half in Italian so you have to find the English match to know what the Event was. 

I don’t have Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula but based on other reviews, sounds like this is the best of the 3 anyway. 

The Austrians have an advantage but really need to analyze a lot (or get lucky) to work it, which could bog the game down.

One player is Garibaldi and is trying to escape the map or stay hidden for 30 turns.  The other players are Austrian detectives working together to capture him.  Garibaldi's movements are hidden but he leaves spore from time to time if a detective comes across an area on the map he was recently at.  Players manage a hand of cards which determine their movement capabilities.

I feel the same way with Garibabldi as in similar games where playing Garibaldi would be fun but playing the detective is sorta boring.  Otherwise the game works fine.

A 30 turn version of Scotland Yard. Differences in feel are that there's never a direct reveal - you only get to see any of the last four spaces he's been. Which makes memory a stronger element - which of the three modes of transport did they use and in which order. And the travel tree (the spaces he could now be) is consequently much bigger. Which seems to make it more futile to work out where he is, and the best plan is to just get your detectives in a wall and shuffle back and forward - which is not that exciting, clever or tension-packed. The wall is possible because the map is a long thin one. So then Garibaldi is dependent on action cards (the other big difference to Scotland Yard) to get him thru the line. That, or detective incompetence. 7ish if you're Garibaldi, 5-6ish if you're a detective.

Steve is right, it does drag a bit and the cards are a bit repetitive.  I can't see myself picking this over other hide-and-seek co-ops.  Since this is "like Scotland Yard", I would definitely like to try Scotland Yard and see if it's a tighter game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Deduction game similar to Scotland Yard (perhaps too similar to own both unless you really enjoy this kind of game), but with a bit more depth. Not as deep or long as Fury of Dracula - somewhere in between.

One advantage this game has over both of those is that, when played with fewer than the maximum number of players, each player on the pursuing side only needs to manage one hand of cards - rather than one hand (or set of route tickets) per character they control. To allow this to work, there is an optional rule (I would argue this should simply be standard anyway) to give players larger hands of cards when there are fewer players on the Austrian side.

The event cards add a number of twists giving both sides plenty of ways to interfere with their opponents' plans - compared with Scotland Yard, where movement on the map is the whole game.

The text on the cards is fairly well done too, and although a couple of the cards could be interpreted more than one way, I think the intention is usually fairly obvious.

I have one very slight worry that repetition might be higher than with Scotland Yard, given that Garibaldi always starts in roughly the same part of the map, and heads in generally the same direction each time. Probably not too much of an issue though.

Rules are straightforward and well presented. Components are excellent, right up to the completely unexpected inclusion of 2 copies of the card deck, one in Italian, one in English! The Garibaldi player screen is a nice addition, carrying a reproduction of the board with the numbers printed intelligently the other way up.

BONUS: This game is rich with historical information (the whole theme and many card events etc. having being lifted from actual events).

RATING: 6
Scotland Yard variant which I feel is marginally better than the original co-operative SdJ winner. I think this is because that Garibaldi is under more pressure than Mr X:- Gazza has to reach one of the exit points on or before round 30, and the Austrian player(s) can see these locations. This focus rather than avoiding the detectives in London means that towards game end things will get close in Italy. Also because there are no trains in Italy means that Garibaldi can't just loop behind the tracking party, he may have to run a tight gauntlet to get behind the Austrians. 

Another plus in Garibaldi is that now cards are held rather than a open pool of tickets. This means more discussion as to hand content and limited options. So for me at least this variant is more social, and with a themed event deck, there are choices in timing of discards and cards held to prevent strong cards getting into the wrong hands.

But as in Scotland Yard there is still that dynamic of a dominant player who will marr the experience by pointing out what should be done. 

Another consideration is if players like the "fuzzy" logic i.e. having to narrow down the escape routes which match the movement cards played (in Cluedo you try to pin the facts down and move on). It stimulates discussion amongst the Austrians and can be a tense affair for the eavesdropping Italian especially if the Austrians are effective in thwarting his best plans. But if the Austrian player(s) find such deduction vague and so confusing it can cause mental collapse and so not care if Gazza makes it to the exit. The pace slows with 4 players, so probably best with 3. If I felt this was still too slow, I might as well play Mr Jack.

This is just not my kind of game.  I was board as we searched around for Garibaldi.  We could not find him and just kind of moved around randomly.

Looks and reads incredibly like Scotland Yard. So much as to almost be a re-theme. I'll be interested if anyone likes this and doesn't like Scotland Yard (if so, it may indicate a real bias).

RATING: N/A
One play. Scotland Yard with event cards. The theme is nicely implemented with rumours of Garibaldi's location if the Austrian's pass through a village within a few days of the fugitive. I am not sure the game beats its predecessor though, as the long and narrow board which Garibaldi must eventually traverse the length of, seems to make a cordon-strategy for the Austrians a no brainer.  Garibaldi then needs the right card draws to bust through. Ingenious, fun if you don't have another similar game, but for me a little fiddlier and less interesting than Ghost Chase (my favourite of the genre).

I like the hidden move fox/hound mechanic.  I bought it hoping for my Scotland Yard fix -- but should've just bought Scotland Yard itself.  (I may be remembering it with rose colored glasses, however).

I like this game as a 2 player game -- with more if the Austrian players don't work well together it's just not a lot of fun and kind of easy for Garibaldi.

I certainly wanted to like this more, but it seems like it'll play more or less the same way - certainly for the Austrians. The historical flavour was lost on our gaming group and quite frankly the text on the cards wasn't educational or an enhancement of the theme, so much as a collection of random drivel spread amongst a deck of cards. The idea is a nice one, the bits are alright, the map is functional and importantly the game length at 30 turns allows room and time to manoeuvre. The problem is that it's probably just a bit too simple with none of the strategising between the players that you get out of Pandemic and very little of the thought needed in an escape game like Mr. Jack. I'd like to have a few more goes at it to be sure - possible that the rating might rise a point if I find myself in a particularly clever game.

RATING: 5.5
Essentially a battleships-esque 2-player that can accommodate more players if they don't mind sharing what is basically one player's job of Hunting Garibaldi (the other player is Garibaldi and must escape). I have fond memories but now I think I'd find it a little repetitive/dull if I wasn't playing the Garibaldi role.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Perhaps the best of the secret chase games. The others being Scotland Yard, NY Chase, and Fury of Dracula. 

It is quick and punchy and doesn't outstay its welcome.  Unfortunately, like all these games they present themselves as multiplayer games, where they really should just be two player.

In all these games, searching for the escapee, just isn't as fun as the one running, and if you are splitting up the duties of trying to track him down your experience gets watered down.  If FoD, there are more entertaining things that the investigators can encounter, but the game lasts forever and comes down to die rolls.  

Here, the system is boiled down to its purest form.  It is a quick chase and then is done.

The Italian version of "Catch me if you can". Fun chase! Turn 8 can be your downfall if you are Garibaldi.

RATING: 5
Short, easy to learn, and kinda fun.  Nothing too special, but it's reasonably tense and exciting trying to get away as Garibaldi, and I could imagine it'd be similar for the co-op team.  Cards determine a lot of what you do, and it seems like it needs one more idea to give you a little more to think about, but fun, tense and short is a good enough combination.  I would rather just play Mr Jack with 2.

This game was so boring it left me angry.  I was not pleased with this one.  There's just nothing to it besides the hidden movement.

Skip this one.

RATING: 7
Recreates the events of 1849 when the Austrian military searched for the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi across the countryside of Romagna. One player controls Garibaldi (whose movement around the board is performed secretly behind a screen) and up to five players control the Austrian patrols attempting to catch him. Movement is card-driven and there are also random event cards. It's probably more enjoyable to play as Garibaldi as there is more tension associated with that role as you can see the Austrian players moving in. This game is very simple to learn and both fast and fun to play with good artwork and components. I also like the historical information contained within the text on many of the cards, meaning that if you take the time to read what's there this game is a very useful in an educational sense, which was one of the purposes behind its design and publication.

Halfway between "scotland yard" and "the fury of Dracula", I was looking since a long time for a similar game. The result is an easy to leard but very intriguing game, that plays in 30-40 minutes. Production details (like the map inside Garibaldi's screen) are really niced and refined. The theme (the Italian national hero escaping from Austrian soldiers) may not be very appealing outside Italy, but after all, why should you care more about Transilvania than Romagna?

Garibaldi is the worst of the "us vs. them" chase titles. The almost total lack of feedback means that the chasing players spend most of the game moving without direction. And the absence of a truly fast movement mechanism means once you're off the trail, you're completely out of play.

RATING: 6
1 Play--2P--Game started very slow, as Austrians are kind of milling around, trying to figure out some sort of direction to take.  Once some small traces of Garibaldi's whereabouts appeared, the tension increased dramatically.  It seemed as if the entire game hinged on a single move, with that scenario playing out several times.  Very simple, very clean one vs. several game.  Shallower, quicker, and easier to pick up than Fury of Dracula.

Finally got this one played and it's pretty cool. Action cards in this type of setting is cool. Neat game but probably best at 2 players. 

[ImageID=554376]

[q="THoiA's Thoughts"]I just am not a fan of these "Cat and Mouse" type of games being played with more than two players. Mr. Jack did it right in giving one player Jack, and the other player...all the other characters. It's especially true with this game where the "cops" can only play a single card per turn, and you are not suppose to talk about what action cards you have. So if I got before you in turn order and play a card that is so-so and you have an awesome card, then you can not play your aesome card because out "team" has already played one this turn. Nope just play this 2 player and have fun it's a fantastic game.[/q]

I love the hide/seek & the theme. Works at the family table wonderfully, but also makes a very fun cat & mouse for gamers, even a neat two-player deductive chase.

I like that the Garibaldi events allow for feints that I, for one, utterly fell for.

Beautiful components, and the screen for Garibaldi has an upside down map to ease their job, a really thoughful design point.

I found the map to be much more interesting than Letters from Whitechapel, but the restrictions of moving by card and the wonky shared deck made this just a bit too awkward to like without reservations.

Only 2 plays so far, one for each role. Enjoyed it but felt it went on just a little too long. May change once I get better. Too soon to rate. Would benefit from including some magnetic pieces to mark the screen with - it's a pain for the Garibaldi player to have to keep getting up and walking round the table to look at the game board.

Update: Have now played 4 games and the last 2 did indeed get quicker and so more enjoyable.

RATING: N/A
Sort of "alternative Scotland Yard" (and thus MUCH lighter than "Fury of Dracula"). It lacks variety (as the Austrians you do the same simple thing over and over: play a card to move your pawn in one of three ways - horse, feet or boat). The Austrian Events are mostly useless; I suspect Garibaldi has a few more interesting choices to do (and more useful events). I wonder if a strategy can really be planned or if it is mostly "let's hope to bump into him".
Quick and simple (thus probably good for families and casual gamers).

RATING: 6
One player is Garibaldi, trying to escape without being caught by the Austrian patrol. The game really is best when one player controls all the Austrian forces, i.e. The two player game. While Letters from Whitechapel (by the same designer) is vastly superior, it is also a lot heavier and longer. For a shorter deduction game experience with some interesting card play I think Garibaldi is great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Better than Scotland Yard and more streamlined than Fury of Dracula.  This is essentially Fury without the fighting.  The game provides a challenging romp for Garibaldi trying to escape the Austrians.  I got this one based on my Italian heritage but the theme of the game based on the history surrounding this hero will probably escape the interests of the U.S. gamer.  Too bad as there's a good game here if you like the "Where's Waldo" search quest.  Beautiful components as expected from Nexus.  Glad to see FFG carried this for distribution in the US.

The chase is very much like Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula. The cards add some depth and variety to the game. Instead of Garibaldi being shown on specific turns, a hint marker is placed on any space that Garibaldi has been on in the last 4 turns that a Austrian is on at the end of the turn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once (as an Austrian). A nice-looking game, definitely close to Scotland Yard in the way it works, but with a few twists. The game is probably quite stressful for Garibaldi, who suffers from the time pressure and cannot really afford any mistake - in my single play, one was enough to greatly reduce his chances of escape. The collaboration between the Austrian players can make the game a bit automatic for some if not everyone is equally involved - especially since some of the starting positions are quite far from the action at the beginning. Overall, I would play it again (possibly as Garibaldi next time), but I am afraid that is not quite a genre I appreciate much.

Plays along the same lines as The Fury of Dracula and Scotland Yard. Lighter than the former, more theme than the latter, yet better than both.

Tread carefully. The quicker you move, especially by horse, the greater your trail, so the more chance you have of being rumbled. Likewise, once Garibaldi's tracks have been uncovered, it's a great feeling for the Patrol to hit the road on their horses and zoom to his tracks.

Letters from Whitechapel however, is better than Garibaldi. Removing the deck of cards and streamlining a game of similar mechanics even further.

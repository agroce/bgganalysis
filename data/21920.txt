Based on 1 play. Theres a whole lot going on in this game, its quite hard to get to grips with.  Some elements of the game (especially the 'no buying resources in the last 2 rounds' mechanic) can make it a bit frustrating - but it makes for a quickfire finish.I won the game and given that I didn't know if I was doing the best thing it shows how inscrutable the game can be.  I went for lots of men and upgrading my factories and getting in 3 mechanical men.  Then some rounds I dedicated myself to getting loads of resources.  It seemed to work, but it didn't feel very tactically sound.

This would have been very good (at least an 8) five years ago but in todays market it just feels a bit too rehashed. Solid game and nothing at all wrong with it. On the contrary I enjoy playing it but there's only so may PoF's Goas etc that I really need.

Highly strategic economic placement game with a solid theme.

The goal of the game is to make the most money, generally accomplished by making inventions which generate income.  Of course to do this, you will need to place your workers (apprentices) in the different locations on the board to acquire the necessary resources.  You will also need them working in the laboratory.  You are given the opportunity to purchase resources if you don't win them (you get what you want for free if you win), but of course money is essentially victory points.  But you definitely have to spend money to make money.

There are several different things you want to do, such as get more apprentices to have more placement opportunities, get lots of different resources (to match the requirements for the inventions), upgrade your laboratory and/or get another one, get mechanical men which will work 24 hrs a day for you, and of course successfully complete inventions before others do so you can get the highest money payout, and you can keep the invention card.  Invention cards allow for a money bonus at the end or allow for quicker completion of future inventions.

Money and resources are hidden, so it's very difficult to tell who's winning, which adds to the tension of the game.  Do I spend my money in the hopes of making more money, or should I be more frugal?  Do I try to work on that particular invention or is someone else already making it, or also starting it?        

Excellent game, scales well, and provides alot of opportunities for strategic play without feeling too heavy.  Always play with the expert rules as they allow for more creative decisions at the start of the game and it reduces the setup time.

After several plays my rating has gone down from my previous 8.  I can't really explain why - maybe it just doesn't seem real fun.  I also don't feel like the theme works real well here.

Worker placement plus.

I like this one!  The mechanics are well done and come together to provide interesting choices.  Money is always tight, even more so since it's both VP and currency.  There's a cycle to ride - gathering resources and then spending them on inventions.  If you can figure out the cycle and how to use the money well, maybe you can make it work.

I'd like to play this one more.  I think there are some interesting mechanics that mesh well with the worker placement.  The delayed nature of building the inventions forces, and rewards, good planning.  It's particularly interesting in that aspect - plan well do well, plan poorly do poorly.

An overly rated worker placement game that falls short on what it would be with the time invested. 

Though it did have good Mechanics in terms of resolving ties, but the theme and overall gaming experience on taking resources and using them to build ‘7 wonders’ type of inventions, fails to appeal to me and my Son. 

Average wood components and lackluster mapboard makes for a dull game.

Interesting resouce collection/area control type game. It has the common 'you need money to make more money which you can then transfer into resources' type game play that many games have. A game where you absolutely must plan ahead two or three turns but your actions (or lack of them) sometimes make it difficult to do that. The last two turns can be tough if you haven't planned accordingly.

Have played it 2 times, and to me, it has become an instance classic. It is a resource management game that task you to the extreme. The area control game play element is per turn basis, thus you need to perform them base on what the other players decide to do and what your general objectives are. A very very good game that has tactical and strategic elements.

I'm not so fond of the genre that someone else has called Euro-efficiency.  However, a plus point for Leonardo is its substantial player interaction in the competition for city spaces.  Familiar mechanics from other games are assembled in a way that feels quite novel.  The balancing act between money, building your production engine and gathering commodities is an interesting one.  Leonardo isn't a short game, but it rattles along with hardly any down time.  Although the mechanics all make some kind of thematic sense, it is a shame that the inventions never become more than "two of this and one of that".  While I enjoy playing this game, I don't appreciate the need to remember the commodities that your opponents are buying in order to avoid being a turn late in building an invention.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Pretty dry game and components are dull. Nice worker placement mechanisms, but doesn't stand out for sny reason and too much luck in whether you are competing for inventions. Might be worth trying with public incomplete inventions. Otherwise, I'd play occasionally and wouldn't hate it, but would prefer something else.

My rating after a single play.  This one leaft me wanting to play again since after the initial learning game there were a number of things that I would do differently if played again.  Still after one game, it's a solid strategic winner without a lot of luck (Only the invention pile) to have Chaos take the driver's seat.  I can see the rating for this one going up with additional plays.

Initial rating of 7.5 based on first play. You absolutely have to complete inventions right out of the gate in order to stay in this game. As well, you need to be collecting commodities all along in order to prepare to complete inventions in the last two rounds of the game.

After two more plays, downgraded to a 5. There's something about this game I'm not getting. Resources are extremely tight and the game is very unforgiving when it comes to mistakes. Once that happens you can't recover and will just drag behind the entire game. Not fun.

Felt like a cross between PoF and Caylus - but nowhere near as good as either of those games.

Maybe further plays will change my thinking - but for now: there are other games I rather spend my time on.

Rating based on just one play.

I had fun playing this.  The worker placement/draft mechanic has been used a lot, but I usually enjoy it.  And you have your set collections for the inventions, and a nice variety of actions to take.

My concern is the chaos/randomness that comes from all the hidden information regarding the invention cards.  Happen to pick the same invention as someone else?  It hurts you.  Happen to have the right components for an invention that was just added?  It helps you.  This has the potential to swing the game.

That said, I still enjoyed it, so maybe it works.

RATING: 6
Struggling with a rating after one play.  I liked a lot of elements of it but I'm having difficulty understanding why hidden trackable info is preferred.  The main aim of the game is to score points by building inventions, and the inventions require specific resources.  They can be finished by another player even if another finishes it first, but they have to have been working on it first.  This means that if you collect the resources for a given item and it gets finished before you start on it, you need to scramble to find another target for those resources and may be unable to do so.  Open resources and building would make the game less wonky for me and also provide more strategic decision of targeting or avoidance.  Anyway, I like a lot of the mechanics.  I think I might drop it and just play Princes of Florence if it weren't for the intriguing drafted opening, which I also want to do the next time I play.  The further I get away from the game the less I want to play it, though.

RATING: 8.5
A fresh face in gaming.  The non-uniform starting conditions immediately sets the game off with a feeling of non-linearity.  The game involves very little luck outside of the order of the inventions.  Game play is well balanced and full of tough choices on each turn.  It is a game that is ripe with opportunity for strategic play and will leave first time players thinking they need to try it again - not because the didn't understand it, but because they did and are ready to try new approaches.  Overall it is not a heavy title and is very approachable.  Well worth the investment.  Play the first game with standard setup rules, but switch to player selected startup once the players know the game. [GTI: AGSD]

RATING: 6
The game is about being an inventor like Leonardo Da Vinci in the Renaissance Age.  The game is a cross between Princes of Florence and Caylus.  The placement of workers in various locations of the board is how you gather important resources that are necessary for you to invent and they come in various prices depending on how other players want them also.  The game works well for what it is but it feels clunky.  A lot of little things that you need to keep track of and moving pieces around just sucks the fun a bit.  You have to place resources underneath the laboratory but it is also where you keep track of how many work weeks you have put into the invention.  If you want to see what you have placed underneath the lab, you have to carefully pick up the lab and pull out the resources.  More often than not you end up knocking the work week marker off its place and you have to wonder where it was.  I guess you can just memorize and try to remember what you placed to begin with and it would be much easier and smoother.  Maybe that's just it.  I don't like having to remember/memorize information that I have paid access to.  Also there is a blind bidding section of the game that I just don't like seeing in economic games.  They are frustrating for me and not fun at all.  Also, with the rules that comes with the game out of the box, the game is just very very unforgiving for the wrong reasons.  Don't get me wrong, I love brutal games; to name a few would be Age of Steam, La Citta and Antiquity.  However, for this game it just doesn't seem to fit for me.  Overall the game is good, but just something that I don't need to have in my collection as I don't have the desire to play it.

RATING: 9.7
Challenging worker placement from the Caylus era.  Florentine mileau reminiscent of Princes of Florence.  Casual gamers should stay far, far away.  Rulebook is only 8 pages, but the clinical, regimented flow is not easy to teach, and planning and strategy is not easy to master.  

You're using product to complete invention cards that are turned up from a deck.  Inventions deeper in the deck are more elaborate and pay more money (Florins).  Money is how you win the game, so that when you spend Florins on additional workers, laboratory upgrades, or peeks at the future inventions, you are directly spending winnings.  Careless errors can hurt you.  Game is played in 9 turns.

Your money and product cards are hidden and have similar backs, which adds nice tension since no one really knows how you are faring.  There is a clumsy deportment issue of having to put components under your laboratory card without players seeing how many cards you are placing there (unless you want to tell them).

Rules badly in need of streamlining, but I am rating it very high because it's more original for its time than people realize, and because it rewards high skill and there is almost no luck involved.

We play with the advanced setup in which you choose your starting favors.  Leonardo is best as a 4 or 5 player game.  I love the worker placement mechanic of apprentices and masters.  I also appreciate the simple design and easy to understand goal behind the game.  If you can deduce (guess) which inventions and placements your opponents will do, and you do the opposite, you will probably enjoy Leonardo.  

The downside to Leonardo is that the blind competition for the same inventions can take one or more players out of the competition early.  Heavily competing for the same resource can also take a few players out of the running, much like a bidding war in Taj Mahal.  

Although the art design is both functional and easy to read, the color pencil drawings look pretty lackluster.    

[b]Codex III with the Edicts Expansion[/b]

I prefer playing with the 4 Edicts.  Players now have to consider (and vote on) which Edict will be enforced each turn. I enjoy the cooperative aspect that the voting process adds to Leonardo, which until this point the game was lacking.  In addition to adding more variety, the Edicts also make it possible to finish more inventions for they add bonus florin, components, and work weeks.  

The only real negative is the potential for an even more run-away leader problem.  The Edict in which you gain 1 extra component with every purchase can really be a huge bonus if you have set yourself up in one or more Shops with 2 influence.

I had a savage attack of deja vu after my first play. This game is 20% Caylus (with its allocation of workers to different zones to gain benifits or raw materials), and 80% Princes of Florence (the aim to create inventions vs creating masterpieces, obtaining robot man vs Jester, review 4 cards). 

In isolation this is a good game but on reflection it borrows too heavily from Caylus and PoF to be considered inovative and for my money I'd rather play Caylus or PoF over this.

Just when I start to like this game, I hit two big turn offs. First, blind bidding for resources when they are so scarce is not a good fit. Second, the last two rounds of the game just stink. They are not really rounds at all, but more of a final scoring. You play the whole game to be able to produce four inventions in the last two rounds. There is a lot of luck in play here. Pass.

Pretty good, but there's a lot of things to remember...what cards you placed under your mats, what cards you looked at in the deck, what resources you're trying to get.

This is a deceptively charming game! there is so much going on at first glance that it seems to be very unorganized and un-fun. HOWEVER, upon getting into the game, there are so many intricate mechanics that are governed by equally intricate and well thought out rules, that this overall game not only entertains you, but makes you feel as if you are one of Da Vinci's contemporaries, a Herculean feat by any measure. It is the ONLY game I have Ever played to this point that does such a unique thing: put you in the mind set and frame of its subject matter. You ARE an inventor, both in game and PLAYING the game as you invent new ways to get what you want and build the games inventions to win it, fun on so many levels!!

Relatively unforgiving gamers game. You have to be on your toes from the start until the end to make a good performance. Worker placement mechanism combined with area majority is a great base for this tense game. Lot's of roads to victory and all possible actions seem to have their merit. Full of hard decisions what to do next. Can easily lead to analysis paralysis. Advanced setup is highly recommended.

A decent game, but not great. The theme is, for me, somewhat dry. The mechanics are pretty solid and there are some tactical plays to be made in the city and such, but I couldn't help thinking to myself quite frequently that it just felt like dumbed down Caylus. I'd like to try it again and see if there is more depth than I originally saw.

If I were more fond of worker placement games, I'd probably like this more. It has the weakness inherent in any worker placement game where one of the options is to get more workers, but allowing "losers" to still purchase items is a clever mechanic. Still, it's mostly a "let's you and him fight" sort of game.

I have witnessed many inane comparisons between games in my tenure at BGG, but the one between Princes of Florence and Leonardo da Vinci actually describes this new game extremely well.  I can say with unhesitating confidence that if you enjoy PoF, you will like LdV.  The converse is also true, if you despise the meticulous planning and sensitivity to player skill of PoF, you will not delight in LdV.  Yes, LdV fills with exactitude the same niche and this inability to ever peek out from under PoF's massive shadow constitutes its largest fault.

However, LdV surpasses PoF in one aspect, that of the sensitivity to player skill alluded to earlier.  The nature of PoF's auction phase absolutely demanded that all players were intimate with the values and character of the items offered.  LdV mitigates opportunites for new players to radically tip the scales towards a player and as such represents a better option for gamers delicate about this potential issue.

RATING: 6

PROS: Lots of player interaction and plenty of choices for actions. Interesting bidding element. CONS: Too many 'blind' elements (Work Selection, Simultaneous work ownership, VP) OVERALL: Like Princes of Florence, this game requires you to essentially map out your strategy several turns in advance, yet unlike PoF your plans suffer much more heavily from the chaos-factor of other players. If you get clipped out of resources on turns 6 and 7, the last two turns can be a frustrating do-nothing affair.

A sort of mix of Princes of Florence and Caylus, but not as fun as either of them. Very dry and the layout, art and italian invention names do nothing to hook me into the theme. 

Lots of interaction, but in a bad way, you have to try to second guess what your opponents want an either convince them not to bother by playing lots of workers in that category or go into a category with few workers and hope you've guessed right and no-one else wants it. 

Overall didn't like it much at all.

** Update, had my arm twisted to play it again, told I must have missed something or played it wrong first time ... nope, dry and dull, rating dropped a point.

*** Update, and again after several years I had the misfortune to play this (should have checked BGG before starting the game). My thoughts haven't changed, just another dry soul-less worker placement euro, couldn't wait for it to end.

It's a worker placement game where you really have to think about how badly you want that space.  Order and worker commitment all play a role.  Additionally, you could be thinking two or three turns out, and still have that invention grabbed out from underneath you.

I found it to be a really stressful experience, with only a little amount of fun.

Really tight and a lot of hustling with who is going to be first on the actions and don't need to pay. Is a resource game with a shortage of resources and money.
The game is much harder with four players. The resources are hard to get for a low price and it always a fight over all of them.
The scoring has always been very close.

WOW! Really like this one...believe the hype...it is a quirky mix of Caylus and Princes, with just a dash of Amun Re sprinkled on top (the "bluff" card and interesting "meeple-bid"). Pleasantly lighter than all of the games mentioned, I did not experience the teeth-gnashing agony of PoF nor the spontaneous brain seizures of Caylus. Despite the previous comment, this game's still quite a "thinker". Great game and well-rendered, and scales well (five-player is an utterly savage contest).

Initial rating 8.5 based on one play at BGG.CON '06.  Enjoyable middle-to-heavy-weight game with loads of interesting choices.  Definitely a buy for me.

NEAT GAME for $10; once you get past the "not so obvious" rulebook. So many paths to victory: which of 5 "favors" to start with (skip the intro level game), when to start your 2nd lab? hire? go 1st? Great bits!  ALSO:
After the Council, which is the first thing resolved (A), EVERYTHING costs florins except for the first person in the city location, not just the market stuff.

When two or more people finish an invention during the same turn, the player with Leonardo is not the one that gets the invention. You instead follow this procedure:
- each player completing the invention receives the 'first' money for the invention.
- each player bids florins to get the invention (the 0 florins are for bluffing!)
- player who bids the most gets the invention.
- if tied, the invention goes to no one and leaves the game.

RATING: 7
9/27/06 - First of all, do not play this game with the beginner setup. Secondly, the english rules need clarification - there is an FAQ but not everything is covered. Just remember that in turns 8 and 9 the only things that can be done are:
i). starting inventions that are requested
ii). placing apprentices and masters in the labs to work on them
iii). completeing inventions you are working on.

Even though the inventions are static - which ones and when they come out are not. Player interaction exists while trying to attain favours, components and even in the race to complete inventions. All the elements of a gamers game exists in this game. Not enough games yet to understand the dynamic of choosing to go last - assuming, of course, you were first at the council. Many times you are left wanting to do more than you are allowed - I hate that (read: creates angst, love it!)

Anytime you've played a game and are immediately thinking about what you could do different for the next session scores big for me.

Bought old Leonardo on a whim, love worker placement, and it is a nice game, it's just not super-compelling for two.  We've made a few modifications to have it be more competitive for a limited number, and using the advance setup option also helps a lot.

Very good game.  I enjoy the building aspect of the game and trying to optimize your apprentice placements.  It can be a bit of a brain-burner at times, and people who analyze everything will slow the game down, but thankfully there aren't a ton of variables to work through so even with analysis-paralysis type players the game still tends to finish up in 2 hours or less.  Ignore the beginner set-up...period.  Anyone on the 'Geek has enough experience with games to start right with the "expert" set up, and it makes for a much better game.  I also strongly recommend playing with the optional "powerful" council rule where you can move someone else's apprentice.  Again, it makes for a stronger game.

Knocked down one spot due to the luck factor involved in guessing what everyone is building.

Heavy weight game: Nice game, however never feels like you have enough time to finish what you start.

This game jumps around from 7 to 8 and back again. I am starting to realize the not enough time is part of the game and the real meat of the game.

RATING: 6
Lots of screwage possible with the worker placements, and figuring out what inventions the other players are working on is critical for the end-game bonus. I like that the lookahead required for planning is limited because of the unknown order of the cards. A few negatives: The theme is lame;  Also, with less than 5, I don't think the worker placement phase would be tight enough. Stuff would be too cheap and the fundamental dilemma of spending victory points to gain advantages would evaporate.

What if Caylus and Princes of Florence had a baby?  Would it have a soul?  Would it be fun?

It could very well be Leonardo.

I had high hopes for this one, but after half a dozen plays with 4 and 5 players (and one pointless outing with 2), I doubt I'll ever play it again.  The game has complexity, a lot of decisions, but  it's complexity for its own sake.  And yet, it's not very difficult to win.

In the end, Leonardo is an exercise with little fun.  It feels more like a job than a pastime.

The artwork (which is *not* Leonardo's) is ugly, the board poorly designed, the end game undeveloped, and the use of Italian invention names ill-conceived (as it serves to distance one even further from the theme).

Addendum:  Trade away.

I have only played this game once, and only with five players, so keep that in mind.

I absolutely adore the central mechanism of the game.  Before the action phases of the game (mostly resource collection with a few special actions thrown in), players mark their interest in performing those actions by placing workers on corresponding spaces.  Placing workers in a space all but guarantees you'll get a chance to perform that action (and does guarantee it at scales smaller than five), but investing too few workers in a space means you might have to pay a lot of cash to get the action.  It's a great balancing act full of really tough decisions.

Unfortunately the whole point of what I've described above is in service of the really uninteresting set collection half of the game.  The reason players want resources is to collect sets of them which they can (eventually) turn into cash, which doubles as buying power in the action plases and is also (basically) your score at the end of the game.  Boring, boring, boring, and completely undeserving of the great other half of the game.  The astute observer will note that this sounds very familiar to another well-regarded game, Caylus, which I rate very highly.  There are a variety of reasons I like that one more than this, most of them sort of intangible.  If I play Leonardo more, I'll try to nail them down.

Advanced Setup Rules Play Only.

Basically this is a game of efficiency: you need to win small area majority battles to gain resources which you can then use to complete inventions before anyone else does and earn both the money shown on the invention card and the card itself, which can cause big scoring in the end game.

Resources in this game include the number of pieces you have, the size of your workshop (i.e.: how many people can work in it at once, and how many mechanical workers you can add to it) and the specific resource cards which are needed when you fill an invention. The scoring is purely money, which you are also often tempted to use to take actions. In short, the person who wins the mini area majority battle in a given area of the board gets the action for free, the person in second can do it for 2 florins, 3rd for 3 florins, and 4th for 4 florins. You're basically spending points to earn points though, so one has to be careful to not get in the habit of doing this to excess. The game tries to tempt you into it repeatedly though, as you can buy an item receive an item/card multiple times if there aren't very many people in the area for the round.

I think this game will absolutely require repeat play because the end game is beyond brutal when players have not carefully planned for it, as no new inventions are put into the display, and you cannot gain more resources, all you can do is spend time. Beyond this, I must state that in my first games, our ability to churn through the invention deck has been pathetic, and it feels as though we were playing woefully inefficiently.

I like it, but I think it ultimately feels a little too dry for my tastes. It's not a game that I would mind playing at any given game session, but it's also not one that particularly excites me either. If I have any major complaint with this game, beyond the feeling of "been there, done that" in the worker placement scheme (insert half of the highly ranked games from 2005 on here...) it is the invention building mechanism, where avoiding what other players are building is very important, but yet, it is very difficult to know what they're building. Conflict means that you have to spend yet more resources. Guessing right means that you get the card without a fight. It's not a huge, huge thing for me, but it bumps this game down a bit into the good but only ok range for me.

Jó játék. Kicsit unom már, hogy minden 2. játékban az a cél, hogy gyűjtögetek, aztán abból próbálok vásárolni, de ez tetszett. A worker-placement dologgal megbolondította kicsit ezt a struktúrát és az is tetszett, hogy igen nagyfokú volt a játékosok egymásra hatása.

Negatívum: nagyon visszataszító számomra a "design"... Valamint az utolsó két kör, amikor csak építeni lehet nincs elég jól kitalálva, mintha a végére elfogyott volna a tervező ötlete. Ugyanis többen arra a sorsra jutnak, hogy ezt a 2 kört szinte teljesen kihagyják, akkor viszont óriási hátrányuk lesz a többiekhez képest, és mindez csupán a szerencse kérdése...

Dutch version.
This is a worker placement game.  Your workers can do a few things, among which is gathering materials.  With those materials you create inventions that you work on secretly with one of your two laboratories.  With only nine turns, it's critical to keep both of your laboratories working as much as possible.  This game was tight with 2 players.  I'd like to try it with more.

First play in more than a year. I'd forgotten the fiddliness of setting up the invention deck.

Picked this up brand new, for a song.  Looks complex, which means a difficult road to the game table.

I liked it, as did my 10yr old.  I think we may have played it a bit wrong.  We were only able to build 2 or 3 inventions each and only flipped a few new ones out.  Must try again, maybe with more players.

Traded away (along w/ Looting London, Modern Art Card Game and Jambo) for Thurn & Taxis, Battle Cry and Heimlich & Co.

Rating after 1 play. Nothing really wrong with it that I can think of. I played with the basic setup, which I think works nicely to give a nice asymmetric starting configuration. Next time we'll use the advanced setup for sure, though. Putting meeples down to earn actions feels like Caylus, but fighting for use of the ability is nifty. EVen that feels familiar, but I can't put my finger on what that's from. Maintaining the order meeples were places in a spot is nice.

This is the 2nd rank of the stratagest game in my mind, just behind Die Macher so far. Unlike Die Macher, it's not necessary for you to spend all day long, a afternoon or a morning at least. How to management your workers to get resource, to get work done is the stratagest park. Even though players didn't talk to much with each others but each step of each player would effect yours. A little luck inside this game but you can minimize it as your playing skills. The more times you play, the deep layers you would enjoy. You must have it if you are a geek.                                                     %u5927%u9B54%u738B July 14th,2007

The first time I played this title was back in 2006 or so. We played with a few mangled rules, like allowing addition of resource cards during the time a laboratory was at work, and that abandoning such work had you lose all your cards. This broke the game balance to the point of mediocrity, but at least we recognised this and determined that the game would, one day, be played again. It did very little for my dislike of the rather washed-out design with smallish and somewhat unclear icons. I also had my reservations about the rather constructed feeling of the design: the private resource allocation with polling round to see who else was working on a specific invention felt rather clunky to say the least. 

Fast forward to 2010, when finally the game appeared anew on the table. I learned that the asymmetry in the startup position I remembered from the earlier attempt was intentional, the result of various 'extras' being applied to a player's position before the game started. We chose our position ourselves this time. We did get a few rules wrong again (we forgot that we could cancel an invention, we forgot the research bonus of 2 weeks for similar inventions, and we didn't use bidding to break ties in completing inventions). However, since the overlap in inventions was minor, and cancelling obviously something done in rare cases only, it didn't really matter. The garish and bleak design was again a sore point with me: basically the board is just a placeholder, not something to enhance the story—in sofar one exists—with. Apart from that, Leonardo appeared to be a solid worker placement title, albeit a fairly scripted one. One basically has a choice between short and cheap inventions, and long and expensive ones, or anything in between, with some options in between; and a means to get around the luck of the draw. Of course there's a balance between lab rats and money to consider too, but the choice isn't really that special: it all amounts to the same thing in the end. Lots of lab rats give you immediate power, lots of cash gives you the power to keep on purchasing with little guys in the fields. Apart from the garish appearance I couldn't find anything at fault with this game, but neither did it sing to me of complex tactics and strategies too. 

The game will probably hit the table from time to time in the future, but I was right in not purchasing this title blindly in 2006.

In this worker placement game, it's a race to complete some of da Vinci's great inventions using your workshops.  But research takes time and the right resources.

So you send out apprentices around town to pick up the resources, improve your workshops, and even get robot workers (no, the rules don't explain the sci-fi diversion). On various spaces you have to allocate workers wisely, because the majority controller pays nothing for the use of that space.

For me this was a mish-mash of things I think other games just do better - worker placement, majority control, etc.  Not a bad game, but hardly as inspirational as Leonardo's drawings.

It's difficult to know whether to invest immediately in production, or in resources, or in work force.  I enjoyed getting my shops up and running and finally cranking out the inventions.

I don't find this game nearly as interesting as I had thought I would, or as many others (based on their ratings) seem to find it. The rules are disappointingly vague on the endgame, and contain a few other errors, besides. This game is simply too acclaimed or highly rated to contain such oversights. Further, thematically, I think the fundamental excitement of completing interesting and meaningful inventions is just plain missing. The game is just looking at the components that you put into building your inventions; your inventions, themselves, so fascinating and important in da Vinci's time, don't even have any contextual or special rules, abilities, or victory conditions associated with them. Like Princes of Florence, it's a game demanding extreme efficiency; unlike Princes, it's not as great a design, and with rules ambiguities. I don't think I'll sell my copy, but with so much other competition on the shelves, I'll likely wait till (if) someone suggests it, as opposed to initiate my own suggestion, anytime soon.

[Since given away to a family member -- I'm unlikely to play again.]

I tried this yesterday night in a 4 players game. It's a weird game because every player have a lot of choices, but everyone must do the same since the beginning. Authors studied an "asynchronous setup" for each player, but this setup don't change the way of playing the game.

By the way, I like so much the way player should pay action in the game (0-2-3-4 coins stuff).

Mind-bogglingly bad.  The rules are incredibly badly-written, inspiring a number of animated discussions about what the proper interpretation of them should be.  Then there's the overused impress someone in Italy during the Renaisance theme.  Then there's the ugly, confusing, badly-designed board.  Ditto the cards.  On top of that, the game itself is almost entirely a hodge-podge of the nifty little tactical elements from games like Puerto Rico, Caylus, and Outpost, but all those bits don't fit together well at all.  The result is a highly tactical, highly luck-driven game that quickly swamps the (randomly determined) trailers in a vicious cycle of failure.  I want my three hours of life back.

In my life I've played several games, but very few come close to this one in terms of overall balance. Sure, some elements have already been seen around, but the bidding system is incredibly enticing and original, making for some really tense moments. I think the length and the "weight" of the game pretty balance each other, with a game hardly breaking the 2 hours mark (once you get a hang of the rules and strategies). Planning is of utmost importance in this game, that's why your first games may last longer, but in a few games you'll be breezing through it in no time. Note to readers of this comment: Before jumping to the conclusion that italian games' ratings are always hyped up and stuff like that, play this game, please, and decide for yourself if my rating is too high or too low. Chances are you'll decide for the latter.

Although I haven't had enough games in to give a truly informed opinion, I will report on what I have learned so far, because this feels like a good, solid game. 

Players are competing to build the Inventions of Leonardo Da Vinci. Each player player must collect Resources, which are used to build Inventions, which are then exchanged for Florins (currency). At the end of the game, the player with the most Florins, wins.

Each player has a number of Workers that are placed in different Regions in order to enhance their production capabilities. Each Region is themed and provides different goods or services, such as the Workshop that generates Mechanical Men or the Academy that provides more Workers. This system works in a similar fashion to the one found in Caylus, but requires much less chart-checking to learn all of the possibilities. 

The player interaction comes into play because players are competing for control of these Regions. Whoever has the most Workers in a Region gets the goods or services for free. Later players must pay 2, 3, or 4 Florins, respectively (ala Goa). If you're the fifth player, tough luck, you get jacked. 

Another important location for the allocation of Workers is the Laboratory. This dictates the rate at which Inventions can potentially be completed (as does the number of factories and upgrade level). This brings up one of the interesting decision-making aspects of this game; players have to balance the *ability* to generate income with the *act* of generating income. Early on, players must get the tools in place to be an efficient producer and then later actually produce the goods. In my view, this is also one of the strengths of Princes of Florence. 

Some of the decisions in this game can be excrutiating (although the game is not as unforgiving as say, Age of Steam). Players, like myself, that are sometimes subject to Analysis Paralysis will feel the burn on this one (but not to the extent of Dungeon Twister, for instance). One of the reasons for this, is that you are never sure exactly which Invention other players are working on, since this information is hidden, so you really have to be careful where to place your Workers and in what quantities. Players who battle it out early on for a particular spot, may see other players swoop in much later in the game and pick up the same resources for free. 

Thematically, I wish the design delivered better on the Invention-building aspect. I don't really feel like I am building Inventions; maybe it's the art or the italian language used on the cards or just some obscure missing ingredient. For reference, Power Grid is an example of a game that delivers well on this idea; I really feel that I am fueling cities in that game. 

I do like this game and all of the similar games I have mentioned here are games that I enjoy, so it makes sense. I don't currently like it as much as Princes of Florence, but I don't have to. I like it for what it is and am glad to have it in my collection.

RATING: 5
A bit overwrought in my opinion with layers of piece-placement bidding and payment. It also seemed to run very fast. The last 2 rounds are clearly very important since that's when your engine is running well but it's easy to be knobbled just because you lucked out on trying to build the same as others.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lackluster addition to the worker placement genre. Players compete to acquire the components to various inventions that are revealed as the game progresses. Resolving claims by two or more players to the same invention is clunky. However, one interesting option on your turn is to examine the top few cards of the deck to discover which inventions will be coming up. In most games that allow you to look through the deck, I find that doing so is of little benefit, but here it's practically de rigueur, especially toward the end of the game.

I liked the mechanics but the end game kind of fizzled.  It felt like the game was just starting to get interesting by the time it ended.  I could see dropping a point or so if repeat plays don't reveal maybe a rule we got wrong.  Just very confusing towards the end in terms of what you could do for the last 2 rounds.  Several rule debates extended this game longer than it should have been.  The time to play (stated on the box) is underestimated.  Count on *at least* 2 hours to play and more time for rules explanation.  Dropping it down to a 6 after 2nd play.

Players are workshop owners, churning out made-to-plan inventions from medieval Renaissance Men.  Players commit their laboratories to working on one invention, with requires resources and time to complete, earning gold.  During a turn they send their workers out into the city to acquire more resources, or into their labs to speed up the work.  Victory is achieved by earning the most gold at the end of nine turns (60-90 minutes).  Good, tight resource management game, certainly in the meaty category.  Fans of Goa, Princes of Florence, etc will be at home here.

Very nice order fulfillment game.  Some similarities to Caylus in the order-choosing mechanism, but it's shorter, less deterministic, and friendlier (nothing nasty like the provost).  I just wish the invention cards had English names so we could get into the theme at least a little bit!

RATING: 5.5
I wouldn't mind playing it again. It was good with 5 players, but with fewer than 4 I think it would suffer greatly. Difficult to grasp the end game of this one on first play, much like PoF in that aspect. I like the 'worker distribution' bluffing and/or bidding, but the limited number of actions, coupled with a shared and finite number of inventions (goals) makes you butt heads with other players almost every turn. It can lead to some frustrating results =)

I need another play of Leonardo Da Vinci. There was something I didn't like. The last turn is completely useless for resources.

If you have bad timing, you can't do an extra invention during the 2 turns you use to complete one at the end of the game. So it's like a wasted turn while others are going to score points which might make a difference if you win or lose.

I found it a bit odd, and it left a bad impression about the game. Other than that, the game itself is very interesting. Some good ideas, area influence for resources is neat. Not sure about the theme though. Seems it could be about anything and have the same mechanics.

RATING: 4
A lot of information is hidden, and there's a good hit of randomness to boot. Not a game for me.

There are two ways to get an advantage over the other players in this game:
1) Determine what they're going to do so that you can perform your actions optimally, ie with the lowest cost/highest payout.
2) Get lucky on what's available to invent.

The former can be interesting, but in this game there's very little information available to use for prediction, so it devolves into a luckfest. There is enough information to make for some interest, but not enough to make me want to play this game again.

A renaissance competition between builders of mysterious objects that would make Jennifer Garner investigate and a fairly competitive game in which players try to compete for the resources available. The latter aspect makes this much less a multi-player solitaire game than "The Princes of Florence" (which has many similiarities) but at the price of less predictability (which for most players will be good). This is an extremely clean and perfect game that is only lacking a little in the theme department, as never once any kind of Renaissance theme really comes out of the closet. Maestro Leonardo wouldn't be disappointed, though....

You know, I thought I would like this. It looked like it was along the lines of PoF, Goa, Calyus... that sort of ilk. Even though I don't always do so well in these games after a game or two I get into them. 
I'm right on the border of absolute hatred for this game.
There's something missing here and I can't tell what it is. Maybe it's the central game of chicken in the first few turns. Maybe it's because you can get completely hosed because of the cards that don't come up, or because of cards that get used up before you can start them. Maybe it's because you have to double guess what other people are doing. Maybe it's because otherwise even players can get extra points (money) just because of a blind bid. Please someone find my game a home with a loving owner.

Good worker placement games are a dime a dozen, and that's exactly what Leonardo da Vinci has against it. Of all the worker placement mechanics coming out, I'm the least interested in the place multiple workers in the same spot to obtain majority concept. But enough negativity. What I did like about Leo is the direct relationship between dollars and resources. There are many opportunities to get what you want in second (or even third) place, but you're going to have to pay victory points for it.

A heavy, brain-[-]burning[/-] melting dynamic worker placement. I call it a “dynamic" w-p game because the order in which the actions of the workers is resolved can change depending on who has the most in that space when you're all done placing workers. 

There are some very nice strategic considerations here, but it all starts to collapse under its own weight after the two hour mark as turns get very long, and the last hour can drag. The last turn is really just a scoring round that you had better set yourself up for with resources or else you're S.O.L. With so many considerations foisted on players, it's a design candidate for "less is more." Also, I don't like the aspect of using workers to get more workers; feels like a false choice, and the person who gets his out first will have a distinct advantage over the other players and should use that advantage to continue to dominate that action space and make the others have to pay if they want workers.

There's quite a bit I like about LdV and I'd play it again, but I also think there are cleaner designs out there (e.g., Caylus) that offer a strategic w-p experience with less AP that don't require the intricate special set up that this one does.

Note: Seems this game is always on sale somewhere for $9.99. According to Mayan mythology, when this game is no longer on sale, our hobby will end.

The graphic design could have been better, symbols larger and the board tidier. This is another nice enough game, resource collecting, converting into money, which is the final victory condition. Easy enough, with a nice majority/costing system. But the rich get richer and again, this game just did not excite me. It's not bad, it's perfectly sound (we thought the start could have been better balanced), it worked well and was fun to play. But, well, it didn't make me want to play it again. I will play it again, but I won't be suggesting it. Heyho. Next!

Rating based on 2 plays.  The game keeps everyone involved with lots of player interaction.  It has a similar feel to Princes of Florence, yet still plays differently.  It's one of the best games to come out in 2006.  I especially like the increasing costs and area control system.  Grade:  B

Ok, I'll not limit my impression to my initial performance as I was thoroughly shellacked.  The obvious mistake I made was to not plan carefully for the last two turns where you need the right resources to research whatever will be left.  Has a nice flow to it, reminiscent of many other worker assignment games (Caylus, etc).

I'll add my voice to those saying it's like PoF, but with higher interaction between players.  Still, it feels a bit cold. I've removed my rating: I'll probably never play this game again, as my tastes have changed and it's not the sort of thing I'm eager to play anymore.

This worker placement / auction / "gather-resources-to-fill-orders" game exceeded my expectations.  It has a bit of the feel of "Princes of Florence" to me.  I'm sure it would be rated a lot higher except for the fact that the luck of the card draw - and something that's difficult to plan for - can have such a huge influence in who ends up being more successful. In my first game, getting the right card showing up in the last turn would have made a difference of almost half of my total points in the game. I enjoyed playing it, but I do prefer games that better reward good planning.

Played this one a few times now. It a light way to introduce someone to a worker placement games. I find it fairly entertaining actually. The thing that really sets this game out is that the jobs the worker take are NOT all or nothing (i.e. only one worker can be placed on a spot). I think this might even be better with more players (I have only played it as a 2P). I also hate setting up the invention decks. And the components are somewhat bland.

Rating based on a 2-player game. It's a good game and it seems well-balanced. I found it a little fiddly, though, with a number of not-so-clean cases that usually turn me off in a "german-style" resource game. There seems to be a part of randomness in the two player game because you buy resources before you know if they will be useful. That also means that card counting could become important... and I don't like card counting. I definitly want to play this one again, with 2 or more players, but I don't think it's on par with other great successes in this area, such as Puerto Rico, Caylus or Princes of Florence.

RATING: 4
After two completely unenjoyable games I can definitely say that I don't like this game. Your success in this game is too connected to whether or not you get lucky enough to work on a project that no one else is working on or in choosing an action that no one else wants.  You don't know for sure so it's just a crapshoot. Long term planning is almost non-existent since not all of the project cards come out each game and they can be rearranged at anytime.  Maybe after 7 or 8 games one might start to see a strategy but the game isn't nearly fun enough to warrant 7 or 8 plays for me to uncover it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Worker placement game with lots of moving parts. Maybe too many of them. The design is sound but the game is somewhat fiddly, starting with the setup procedure and including per-turn accounting work.

I kind of like the idea that players can choose their set of starting resources according to the strategy they are planning to pursue but the downside of this is that you need to have played the game at least once before to actually be able to make meaningful decisions.

Ahhh. How much I wanted to like this. I had a feeling that it wasn't going to work for me in the end and that was pretty much the case. Simply put, LdV isn't a bad game - there are just so many better examples of Worker Placement games out there now. I liked the theme and the need to build inventions to earn money. I often enjoy games where money and points are one in the same. However, in the end I just never felt all the parts jelled together into a cohesive whole. Plus, there is some of the worst art design I've ever seen in a game and there is one component whose only purpose is to stand there(!) At least that is amusing. I like the increasing cost system to buy resources, but again, that's been done in other games of this kind. Overall, nothing would be left behind if I never played this again. It's all be done better in games that came after this. LdV is an earlyish example of WP games and I'm happy to have tried it out. Not a bad game, just not a very good one either.

My initial impression is that this might be a good game between equally competent players. The problem is that it might take 6 or 7 playings to reach that compentancy level. Not sure I am willing to invest that many playings to see if I really like the game. As a first timer I really didn't think about preparing for the end turns or of how important the ROBOT was or of how much value a similar symboled invention was or of what the value of the different items in the game might be. Not sure if I will ever care enough to find out. Certainly worth one more try but will it improve enough during that play to foster enough plays for me  to become a good player of the game is doubtful. From Bob Wilson 2-19-11

I don't know why, but this one never sat that well with me. It seems like a decent worker placement game and I like that your "victory points" and money are the same unlike so many games where your goal is to spend all your money as often as possible to get the most points. Maybe the different starting setups is what bothers me...not sure.

Excellent midweight game, reminded me of Princes of Florence - if not quite in that exalted company. Have played 2p,3p, 4p and 5p now, and seemed to work well with all.  Timing the run at the end is key.  I don't think you need use the initial setup (not sure it is particulalry balanced - go straight to the 'advance' setup.  Marked down as the draw of cards at the end can make-or-break a play.

Opinion: long time willing to play it (more than 5 years) and liked it. In a nutshell, is a worker placement game without anything else, but the way it is is really good. Place your workers in the different spaces, no matter who is there, and then resolve it depending on who has more workers there or who arrived before. All of this just to develop the different inventions in the laboratory. Worker placement without any superfluous thing

RATING: 7
Leonardo da Vinci is a well-engineered game of efficiency and planning.  It plays a little bit like a more tactical Princes of Florence grafted to the bite-sized placement rounds of Caylus or Louis XIV.  I like it, but you know what?  I've been there and done that, and I've made these same decisions in other games.  Leonardo da Vinci feels to me like a rearrangement of other, better games I've played in the past (Caylus not included).

But I don't want to oversell the point.  There are definitely some interesting things happening in Leonardo da Vinci.  The highlight is the way that you allocate time and resources to projects in your workshops.  You want to be the first to complete the project, but this may require manpower that you need in other areas.  I also appreciate having the choice to buy more than one of something if I'm willing to spend victory points.

Leonardo da Vinci is a game I'll happily play, but would never buy.  It just doesn't have enough shape or focus or excitement.  You do some things, then you do some more things, then the game ends.  These days, a Euro has to offer more than that in order to distinguish itself.  Leonardo was created by a team of four designers, so perhaps its not surprising that the end result is a perfectly working game lacking in vision and personality.

Rating after two plays with 3 and 5 players: rating may change after more plays. Good (euro)game basing on economic handling of resources and manpower. Unforgiving. It's a pity that the endgame seems flawed. The artwork (of the main board and cards) could have been done much better (they're not pleasing neither aesthetically nor ergonomically). The free giveaway expansion seems to be only a bugfix for the 5 player game. So this leaves the impression that this game was not fully developed before publishing.

Very good game and meatier than most released this past year.  At the same time, it is not a long game, which is good in my book.  The first game is definitely a learning game, as the contents of the cards (gold cards always have two each of two resources), and the pacing (you want to start a final build in step 8, but not step 9) takes a bit to get used to.  Looking forward to more plays of it.

I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't.  It has too many game mechanics and aspects that I hate.  (1) You have to count cards to win.  (2) There are wayyyy too many things to pay attention to at any given point in time.  (3) You can be SEVERELY screwed by the other players without them even needing to try.  (4) Early mistakes can ruin the game for you, so you really need to play frequently enough to avoid those mistakes.  Anyway, I felt good that I was playing pretty much the same strategy as another experienced player who did very well (even though I was often playing first, so it wasn't just copying), but they executed that strategy well, and I did not.  I've played twice, and I'm not excited about a third.

What an awesome game! One of the best worker placement games I've played. Tough choices. changing situations, interesting mechanics. 

So you want to work on a few of Leonardo's inventions. Great! Choose your work and send out your people to the town for materials, additional workers, ways to improve your laboratories or the town council, where you may get additional favors. Easy. But wait.... 

... you pick your destination and send send in your people. How many, it's up to you. But, you won't be able to add to them later on. Why is that important? Because if anyone places more people there than you do, they will have the first dabs on whatever is there to buy. And first player gets it free, 2nd for 2, 3rd for 3 and 4th for 4 Florins. This stuff gets expensive. So how many people will you send out? And if you send out to many, who's going to be working on your invention? Will you be able to finish it before someone else does and they will get more money than you and what's more important the card of the specific type of trade which will gain him more points at the end of the game?? 

You need to manage your people, but at the same time try to earn as much money as possible. See, money is points at the end of the game, so you want to have the most of it. So you don't want to splurge on stuff around town. Not when the price goes up. 

As if all that wasn't enough you only get to visit the town 7 out of 9 rounds. The rounds 8 and 9 are spent on beginning new inventions or ending the ones you work on. But wait, for those 2 rounds NO NEW INVENTIONS WILL ENTER THE GAME ANYMORE!!! Dio mio!!! Never mind you have to have enough materials for the last 2 rounds, you have to do it cheaply, because as you already know, cash is king at the end!! 

Excellent game!!! If you haven't played it. You should. If you don't have it yet, buy it!! You won't be disappointed. Very, very good game!

Very similar to Princes of Florence, but the bidding mechanic has been replaced with a placing procedure somewhat akin to Caylus. However, each place can have multiple players.

Have played this five times so far (twice with 4 players and three times with five) and it is a very clever and well balanced game... It can be totally brutal though, and it's definitely one where mistakes cost you the game.

A mix of familiar mechanics combined in a solid design. Everything works and gameplay is tense, but there is nothing that makes it stand out. The theme could have been better implemented, as what ultimately distinguishes the various inventions is which resources are needed to "create" them. The fact that I often could not decipher their names and cryptic images didn't help. The incredibly ugly board did nothing for me, either. I would definitely play it again, but will not suggest it.

fabulous! there is some really important timing in this game. as there is no resource collection the 8th and 9 turns, you've got to time it so you've got both labs cranking out inventions on that last turn.  Adds a bit o strategy (vs. tactics) to the game.  quite nice.

got a copy from my usa-only secret santa 2007 - thanks santa!!

2008-02-21 - finally got my copy on the table.  good struggle for resources.  I felt much more strapped for resources this time around.  gotta watch over spending.  could have won if I had bid less on my last invention.  good close game.

The bastard love-child of Caylus and Princes of Florence, I prefer it to both--it's shorter than Caylus and has more tense player-interaction than PoF. It's not as good as Goa, though. Needs more plays with more people to be sure.
[EDIT] Relatively quick, demands planning but is not as brutally unforgiving as PoF, and has mechanical slaves (always a plus). Excellent game. 
[EDIT] Can drag with people even remotely afflicted by AP, and the setup is tedious. The engine itself is elegant simplicity; the total package is not.

I recently played this for the 2nd time (although I didn't remember much about the game).  I won, but I complained through the entire game that I was going to lose badly because of all the mistakes I was making.  In that game, I completed 4 inventions, but 3 of those were near the end of the game, so I didn't have time to spend the money from them.  Other players created several inventions early, but spent most of the money from them on improvements like mechanical men.  But there were lots of small errors which caused large perturbations in score (like being off by one florin or one apprentice probably caused a 16 point swing, or more).

One thing I dislike about this game is that it all comes down to timing... making sure that you have enough resources (workers, lab space, and components) to complete inventions at the end of the game in the two research-only turns.  You have to remember to take into account the 2-week research discounts that each player gets for building a similar invention to the ones they've already completed -- for example, a big invention could be built in only 11 weeks if a player had completed 2 similar inventions earlier.

There are several different strategies, which is good, but I think the required elements to follow any particular strategy are too complicated and expensive.  I think the game is similar to Princes of Florence, where you have to choose which items you want to bid against the other players for, and you have to choose a different strategy path if another player beats you to that item.  But unlike Princes of Florence, if you decided to make a particular invention in Leonardo, you need to obtain very specific components, so if you miss even one of them due to a player conflict, you're screwed -- it's too expensive in workers and time to switch to another invention.

An interesting euro game.  You need to manage your resources, which in this case also include your workers.  Should they be assigned to the lab where they can speed up the research on the various trinkets, or sent to town to pick up resources or special items.

I really bungled my first attempt at this one (bad strategy - did not know what to expect), and am willing to give it another go.  Everything is important in this one, and you need to keep a close eye on the competition.

I bought this from some local board gaming friends.  In this game you must balance distributing workers on the board to gain items such as resources against having the workers man your workshop.  This game heavily emphasizes long term planning.  This is also one of those game where the playing time is usually twice as long as the 60 mins mentioned on BGG.

Lots of nice elements to this, but a bit too many? The board seemed overly busy and in the end it seems to come down to which cards come out since you can't plan for the cards that ARE out as they are likely to be done that turn.

Perhaps it would be better with 4 not 5? but then the board itself would become less busy and I think there were so many spaces to go that you really need enough players to fill them.

Easy to learn strategic game. Several types of resources, several types of inventions. A meeple placement game. Place your meeples to get resources, or to progress inventions, or to get more meeples, or to get some bonuses. Resources cost money and are the area where most players interaction is. Inventions give money and bonuses. The player with the deepest pockets wins.

RATING: 8
This is a worker placement game, similar in spirit to Fresco (but without the hidden placement) and Stone Age, but with an interesting twist. Worker placement in Euros is traditionally done on a first-come, first-served basis, to gain "access" to some spot on the board (to execute an action or collect a resource). In Leonardo, it is possible to "butt" in line, by simply placing more workers than the other players, after they have played. There is also the "master" who represents two workers, and he can be placed separately, even in spots where he has previously placed workers.

There is a race to collect resources, and then commit those resources to conducting "research" in the various laboratories to discover inventions. As the game progresses, more sophisticated inventions worth more VP start coming out, which require more resources and commitment of more workers. This is because the inventions are not only dependent on the resources, but also how much man-power (or robot-power in some cases) is allocated to the two or three laboratories the player has.

It is a fascinating game in that regard, and with a very limited number of turns, it feels very tight, much like Princes of Florence. A very good game, perhaps a "classic" like PoF, but only time will tell.

Loved my first play.  Expect my rating will go up.  It has a little bit of a PoF feel to it even though the gameplay is quite different (hardly any auctions, worker placement, ...).  I think it might be the need to plan ahead & the "unforced errors".

Enjoyed another game with 3p, this time using the expert set-up.

This is a very good game.  It reminded me a lot of princes of florence in some ways, but instead of buying stuff with money through auctions you assign workers to get some stuff and pay victory points for taking second - fourth place in the auction.  Common goals with some reward for doing it first, this game has a lot going on and is very fun to play.

Updated, started to really drag out for what it was.  There was a batch of euros around the same time that were just a large mish-mash of mechanics popular at the time.  This was one of them.

Well I'm sorry to spoil the party, but this game's mediocre at best. Too much of the game is taking place 'blind' for any form of strategy to be possible. You've no idea which inventions others are working on, so you can accumulate resources only to see the card snatched away before you start work. You can examine the draw deck, but then so can someone else who instantly wrecks the order you chose. Complete an invention at the same time as another player, and it's a blind bid to see who gets it. Others may like the game, but the combination of blind action and blind bidding mechanisms kills this for me.

RATING: 6
Great theme--it feels a lot like working for a pharmaceutical company or something, with the secretive information and the type of competition the game encourages. However, the game can get very frustrating if you happen to get off the schedule; other players will have laid claim to all the inventions without your knowledge and it's really difficult to pick up again. 

Just to argue with what other people have been saying, I will remark that it's really an area-majority game, closer to Louis XIV than to worker placement games or to Princes of Florence (with which it is often compared).  (2 plays)

Indubbiamente un gioco per giocatori, non privo di profondità. Personalmente non mi piace la modalità con cui si nascondono le carte sotto i propri laboratori, l’avrei resa più pratica con l’aggiunta di alcune carte neutre. E’ un gioco, a mio avviso, un po’ freddo, in cui l’attenzione ad evitare l’errore pesa eccessivamente.

I was not impressed.  The allocation of workers was very cruel and unforgiving.  I went multiple rounds spending 4  workers without getting a single resource.  Call me spoiled, but I want some kind of compensation.  Racing for the inventions made a very tense and uncomfortable environment.  Also, there just weren't that many paths to take.  You could vary how you did inventions, but you are still going to be doing inventions.  It felt like a game on rails to me.  And for a game on rails, there were still a good number of rules to remember.  Generally all about how you had to stay on those rails and couldn't change things once you got rolling.If you want to attack me, then roll some dice and kill my soldiers.  DaVinci was a passive aggressive play ground.

I've played with 3, 4 and 5 players using the beginner's set-up. Leonardo reminds me a lot of Princes of Florence but it has a more complex auction/buying process that promotes a greater degree of interaction between the players. On the negative side, Leonardo is not as well-designed as PoF; there are some mechanics that add needless complexity. The theme is all too easily ignored, which is perhaps fortunate as it is inherently absurd. But at least the designers had the sense to approach the presentation of the game with a dose of humour (e.g the mechanical men)!

Yes nothing new (hard to do that nowadays don't ya think?) but quite a good game here that I found fairly thematic, the theme actually helped me to learn/understand the game which was quite easy. 

Rather than the placing worker comparisons it feels more like people are bidding in little mini auctions on the board which is actually what you are doing although it is kind of a combination of both. First place gets you the particular action free, second then can buy it for 2, 3rd then can buy it for more and so on. With your winnings you are planning to complete inventions up for grabs and you hope to be the first to do it so you get the card otherwise if 2 people complete at the same time there is a blind bid for the card (which can be points later). 

Most similiar to POF I think as there are multiple paths with a common goal in the inventions (works) and quite a few things to bid on here (which is the core game as well) like: obtaining more men, buying a robot, upgrading a factory, special actions and different resources. The main difference being that the same thing can be bid on and taken by more than one player making it feel a little more interactive and introducing a great screwage element. It also feels just a tad lighter than POF but optimal player numbers will be similiar I think with 2 and 3 not great (not competitive enough), 4 prime and 5 good but pretty rough to get what you want, POF really shines with 5.

Fairly strategic, low luck, fast pace, small screwage factor, good balance and decent replay make this a great game. Not sure how long it would stay fresh though but great for occasional playing for sure.

Played with both three and four players. The game played faster than most games with around the same amount of depth. There might have been too many options to choose from each turn, but we could only choose a limited amount. I'm not sure if that's good. On one hand, it made me feel like I was missing out on part of the game. On the other hand, that might make repeated plays interesting since I'll able to try different strategies each time.

RATING: 8.5
This is a solid and fun worker placement game.  Like other games in this genre you never have enough resources to do what you want.  When you're trying to do the same thing at the same time as others, those actions go up in cost.  Working out-of-phase with your opponents is helpful, although in a 2p game you end up simply lowering costs for everyone.  Players are allowed to specialize immediately, which lets you diverge your strategy from your opponents.

The emphasis of this game is efficiency.  You have limited actions, and the currency you use to perform most of them double as your VPs.

I like the balance between building multiple inventions of the same type at a decreasing cost versus spreading out your builds for more points at the end.

The game length feels right.  I doubt that it could support much more in terms of play time, but it's easy to get it played multiple times in a row.

This was a great game. It's similiar to Princes of Florence. It's only flaw I've seen is for players to get into contention of the same production, but since the value of winning the actual card isn't that great, and since the loser of the auction for the card keeps his money, it's not that great a flaw.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2017)

I bought Leonardo da Vinci when CSI had it on sale, and it was on sale for ages so I, naturally, was expecting a very regular game, however, I´m pleasantly surprised.

Leonardo da Vinci is a mix of worker placement with area control.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 110 minutes.

The game´s components and art is ok, nothing too exiting though. There is a pawn (Lord of the City) that you never use (you are supposed to use it to show what action in the city you are resolving, but the rules don´t mention it). The rules could be better written, there are some ambiguities.

The theme is ok, but you don’t feel it though the game.

Best with 4 players.

The game´s decisions are interesting (where to play your helpers, where to play your master, which invention to pursue, should I go for the same kind of invention of for a different kind?, should I upgrade my laboratory?, should I get a robot?, should I pay for the benefit of my spot? Should I devote more pawns to my invention?, should I get resources?).

On the bad side, I (somewhat) dislike that when you and other player finish an invention at the same time, you have to auction for it. This allows the other players to pull ahead and the competing players to fall behind and it is mostly luck if (furthermore at the beginning of the game) you do the same invention. Perhaps this issue can be solved for me with more plays. In general, the game has a low luck factor.  Another issue is that it seems it is hard to catch a runaway leader. I need more plays to verify if this is indeed the case.

Bottom line, Leonardo da Vinci is a decent game and I should like it more but I wasn’t excited over it when I played it. I can’t say at this moment why I don’t like it more, I should love it but I don’t. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me with more plays and I’m open to play it again, however, as I´m currently trying to downsize my game collection, it has to go. If I play it again I will play with the variable setup, we played the introductory one.

Plenty of decisions to make as your have a limited number of workers to assign to tasks and you need to be as efficient as possible.

I have noticed that some players will get a little too absorbed in having their workers all work. That means that the player may have to pay in order to take the action. You really have to think about whether that is a good idea or not since money is victory points.

Update: I feel that there are better worker placement games out there.

RATING: 7
Rating based on about 10 plays so far.  The design is elegant and, while reminiscent of other games, notably Princes of Florence, Louis 14th and perhaps Caylus, it has a number of unique design elements that separate it apart from many of the other "same old" games out there.  There is the fact that you can take multiple actions at one location, albeit at a higher cost (and remember what you are paying with is victory points, same as in Traumfabrik).  Also the bidding for the patent rights is a unique element.  Downsides?  Some have questioned how you can easily get stuck the final two pure research turns, recommending that new inventions be flipped between turns 8 and 9.  I think the Market expansion helps some, but does not completely alleviate this issue.  Also, there seems to be a bit of luck favoring the player who happens to start out with uncontested patents early in the game, whereas those involved in bidding wars (whether they win or lose them) are necessarily going to be playing catch up.  The fact that you at some point or another need to be at the different locations on the board makes this an interesting resource management game, and the pressure to produce by the end of the game has the feel of Princes of Florence, although the game mechanics are very different.  I think the game plays best 4 but is also challenging with 3.  With 2, it seems to easy to get stuff, with 5 (haven't played with that many yet) but it seems like it would be too difficult to get everything you need and much more chaotic.

Update:  Revised rating downward from 8 to 7, mainly because I don't really have a strong desire to play it these days.

Old Comment: I'd give it another chance, but this game irritated me in multiple ways the first time I played it. In order of importance: having inventions be private makes this a guessing game akin to Race for the Galaxy. Educated guesses, to be sure, but still guesses. Second, the game collapses currency and victory points into a single number. You buy resources with money, so your score goes down. You then complete inventions with resources, and are paid money (you score goes back up). I like games where you can manage various elements to build up your score. When your score fluctuates with nearly every decision, the enjoyment goes down the drain. Third, mechanical men: theme killer. 

New Comment (over a year later, 11/09): I came back to this and though I prefer it over Pillars and possibly Stone Age, that's not saying much. The truth is, I think this is an inferior version of Louis XIV with a development arc (production snowball) instead of variable player powers. I appreciate that it experiments with several clear departures from garden variety worker placement, but it doesn't come off.

Will appeal to fans of games like Princes of Florence and Caylus.  Players must choose how to use a limited number of "apprentices" each turn to either secure advances, get "components" that are used to build inventions, or to work on inventions in their labs.  An innovation here is that each invention requires a certain number of man-weeks to complete.  The more apprentices in your lab, the faster the work takes, and advantages go to players who are first to complete each item.

Workers assignation is similar to Caylus to activate a particular city area and it reminds me Princes of Florence in the theme, but this time you have to make inventions. Boring

I think this is a very clever engine+auction game. Doesn't get a lot of play since some people in my regular group don't really enjoy it.

Not that they hate the game, just don't feel any particular want to play the game -> something else is picked.

Completely uninteresting theme - why not make it a cooking game like Ãƒâ‚¬ la carte, where you gather ingredients and let them cook for a while?  I almost avoided this game because of the theme, but it is very enjoyable.  It's easy to learn, and definitely feels like many other games (Princes of Florence for the limited number of rounds, Caylus for the worker placement), but it's very relatively quick and moderately challenging.  There seems like there is so little time in which so much has to be completed - it is evident that good play makes a big difference, and that there are many different routes to victory.  Nothing groundbreaking, but very solid.

Update: Usually ends up being quite confrontational and somewhat annoying.  With so many worker placement games, there's really no desire to ever break this out.  Traded away.

RATING: 7.5
A heavy game where players try to complete different inventions for money. Money is extremely tight, so the game feels like every little decision plays a huge part in how well a player is doing. Despite the brain-burning feel, the game is actually quite quick and can be completed in a short time.

I have had only a solo play to see how the game goes. It seems lots of tight decisions to make, and the bidding element adds an extra tension to an already tight game. Good planning is required.

The game is a hodge-podge of familiar mechanics (the game it reminds me of the most is Louis XIV). There is worker placement in areas to get the benefits, and developing cards to get points. In addition, you can invest in your infrastructure to create more labs and get more workers. All these choices make it interesting to see if there is a dominant strategy out of all the different possible strategies. I enjoyed my first playings and I am looking forward to my next game.  

The beginner setup is very fiddly and hard to keep straight.  Since the expert setup options are all fairly balanced I recommend that you go directly to the expert game.

It feels like a mixture of PoF and Caylus with more luck added. The system has some flaws and the endgame is just racing and for me this has the PoF-problematics of the works. Feels a bit old already.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an excellent entry in the most popular BGG category: mid-weight Euro. While it is somewhat derivative of other great games (Caylus, Louis XIV) I do not see this as a flaw - it is becoming ever harder to be innovative as hundreds of games are published every year so it makes sense to make incremental improvements to existing mechanics. While Leonardo does not have the elegance or replayability of Caylus it may appeal to a broader range of players as it puts greater emphasis on long term planning with surprises and variability (i.e. luck) about what may come out. This should help keep the interest of those who are less experienced (although they will make many mistakes in their first games). UPDATE: after nine plays my liking for this game has cooled a bit and I am adjusting my rating down one point to 8. My most important concern is that the final patents revealed are very important and which ones you are prepared for is nearly random (unless you happen to take the pile examination role on the turn where it is likely to matter). Update: The lack of ability to plan for future patents has really cooled me on this game. I have lowered my rating to 6 and given away my copy.

Pretty simple game of building "inventions" to make money. The last two rounds of 9 are pretty pointless (basically just finishing products). Not enough competitive action, probably works better with 4 or 5 players and probably doesn't much work with only 2.

An upgrade and resource draft provides currencies needed to power a wealth engine. Efficiency gains and expedition rewards are sought throughout, points beget points, the positive feedback is so thick in the air you can't fly an ornithopter through it. The basic concept isn't very distinctive and there's no single very compelling element; also I think the game might have done without some of the compound punishments and compound rewards. The theme is extraordinarily tacked on, but I'll sum it up anyway. You have this gourmet kitchen and send your employees to market to gather ingredients for a selection of special recipes. The best chefs will work only in the finest cookeries and will not run market errands. Towards the end of the day, the market is closed and you're just cooking away for the sultan's great banquet, assuming your pantry is properly stocked anyway. Two units of venison, one unit of plum, stew for about eleven units of kitchen labour, and hope you will be the first to present this dish... nope, Bob was, [i]again[/i].

RATING: 6
Based on 3 plays.  Leonardo should be one of my top ten games, with its tight resource management, creative auction mechanics, and premium on long-term planning.  Unfortunately, it suffers from plodding play and a tortured end-game.  The former I can forgive (or at least blame on my opponents), but the latter is crucial.  Doing well on the last few turns requires an inordinate amount of planning in terms of cards and man-hours - and this from the guy who keeps a pen and paper handy while doing his Age of Steam accounting.  And even with such planning, your success or failure can hinge on the cards revealed at the end if you don't manage to take the "consult top 4 cards" action or if someone completes a key invention before you can start it.  It can make for an unsatisfying end to an over-long game.

PLUS
1. Dowolny, atrybutywny, różnorodny start (gracz ma budżet na wybór konfiguracji startowej). 2. Fantastyczny mechanizm wybierania czynności umożliwiający korzystanie z danego pola więcej niż tylko jednemu graczowi, tym samym zapobiegający licytacyjnej wojnie totalnej. 3. Różnorodne i wolne metody do zwycięstwa, liczy się koncept, konsekwencja i efektywność jego wdrażania a także pewna miara elastyczności. 4. Operujesz pieniędzmi i grasz o pieniądze --> środek=cel --> prawdziwa gra ekonomiczna bez skonstruowanej konwersji pieniędzy w punkty zwycięstwa. 5. Jak na grę ekonomiczną sporo interakcji, jednocześnie bez frustracji (poprzez mechanizm, patrz 2.).
MINUS
Kolejność graczy nie dowolna lecz według ruchu wskazówek zegara, choć i temu problemowi troche zapobiegnięto: gracz startowy nie zmienia się automatycznie lecz może być wybrany poprzez inwestycję w odpowiednie pole.
SUMA
Świetna, może najlepsza gra gospodarcza z atmosferą a przede wszystkim wolnością gospodarczą wraz z masą decyzji krytycznych: rozbudować laboratorium czy dobudować drugie, pracować nad projektami czy ulepszyć pracownię, inwestować w akademię nowych pracowników czy iść na rynek po surowce, a może lepiej do starosty po przywilej? Arcydzieło...

PLUS
1. Free, attributive, diversified start (players have a budget for selecting their start configuration). 2. Fantastic mechanism of action selection enabling more than one player to use a selected action, with that avoiding a bidding total war. 3. Various and unforced methods of achieving victory, important is the concept, its consistent and effective realization and some decision flexibility. 4. Money has a mean-end function, making LdV a real economic game without any constructed conversion of money into victory points. 5. Rather interactive for an economic game at the same time avoiding frustration (by means of the mechanism described in 2.).
MINUS
The playing order is fixed according to the clockwise rotation, but even this problem is mitigated: starting player can be chosen freely by investing in the appropriate action.
SUM
Great, maybe the best economic game, having atmosphere and, above all, granting economic liberty along with many critical decisions: shall I expand my laboratory or build a second one, work on projects or upgrade the workshop, invest in the new workers academy or go on the market for resources, or maybe to the city hall for a privilege? Masterpiece...

RATING: 7.5
Very good clever game, i'm surprised it doesn't get rated higher on here... The 2 player game was pretty poor though.

Lots of interaction (i really can't understand how anyone could think otherwise), somewhat unforgiving (which is good - right?) & some nice, neat mechanics (especially like: money being the victory points, mini auction/worker placement for resources, lab upgrades)

TRADED: Just found I didn't really fancy playing much any more. Many other games do very similar jobs. Still, a decent game that i would happily play if someone else brought it along.

I liked the game well enough, but not all of my friends agreed.  We all enjoyed the allocation of different resources, but I think people were still placing a low value on taking material cards.  There's definitely some randomness with the draw of the last inventions in the research-only endgame, since only one player can make the final rearrangement to the card order.

One game, 5p.  This game was about as good as I expected.  I felt like it combined a few mechanics and ideas from several games very well; this does keep its weight rating a bit higher though.  The players were divided into two camps, though - they either liked it, or really hated it.  There was some unfortunate luck for some players, but that was coupled with some poor choices, and essentially destroyed a few players chances to win.  I guess I'm saying that this game should not be played with 5, and should be played more than once.

RATING: 7
Interesting "worker placement by majority" mechanic that works well.  Fairly heavy/hardcore as a lot of forward long term planning is necessary and AP does happen.  Plays reasonably fast and there's little downtime as there's always something interesting to think about.  Good with the right group of serious players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked the theme and the fact that you need to manage a lab to create inventions. What I hated most is the auction system that slow down the game way too much. Most of the fight are done on the robot/lab upgrade and on the new worker. They should have split them to reduce competition and accelerate the game. I did not like the fact that the victory points are the ones with the highest amount of cash. Since it's only the player with the last most profitable invention that wins ( since nobody set money aside). Personally, I would have given points according to the amount and variety of invention types you made.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An area influence and planning game that has several elements compared with Princes of Florence and Caylus.  You develop influence in various areas to acquire manpower and resources for developing inventions as efficiently as possible.  Be VERY careful that you do not get the wrong resources or do not plan for enough manpower/time to complete the last two inventions.  There are end game bonuses for developing up to five different types of inventions.  Game seems ideal with three players (at least it is for me).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If its a game that you will only pull out once in a great while with different people, its probably not a great choice.  Its a game with many interesting choices but people who have played before will have a huge advantage over anyone who has not.  Its all about being the most most efficient with your money and workers...and making sure to have an invention or two cooking in the labs for the last two rounds.  Worker placement games are generally not my favorite type of games and I have a couple others I prefer (i.e. Agricola).

A little dry, and so many things are going on this game I can see that multiple plays are required to wrap your brain around everything. I like most of the mechanics of this game except that it seems to be missing something when you actually build one of the machines. I can't seem to explain it, but it just feels like it is missing something, or there is a connection that isn't there.

Update: Yeah, this one is not as bad as needles in the eyes, but really this isn't my type of game.

Currently on my wishlist, although I am waiting for more opinions and information before I commit completely to buying it.

UPDATE: I now have a copy on loan thanks to the Hovas. Hasn't hit the table yet, but it soon will. I'm a little worried about some aspects of the rules, though.

UPDATE: Played once now. Setup is really clunky, and I'm just not a fan of "play your workers to collect resources." Screwage in the city council and the bidding for cards are also a bit off-putting, although not devastating. The strategic element is partial compensation, and several of the other parts of the game are interesting, so I rate this higher than the superficially similar Caylus and Pillars of the Earth. My rating could swing either way by a point with more play.

It does feel like the developer could have cleaned the game up a bit, like there is a better game in there wanting to get out, but I have felt like that about all of the worker placement games I have tried.

UPDATE: Played one more time, and playing it right didn't really burnish it much. Not enough of a variation on "slap a guy down to grab a resource" to maintain the fun. Down to 6, and returned to owner. Not bad, and some neat ideas, but needs quite a bit of work.

RATING: 5
The components are nothing special, including the artwork in general. Yet another run-the-board-in-order bidding (or 'staking') game. Nice mechanics, though, with a [GameID=555] feel and twist. Too bad the rules are godawful, and the included player aids are tiny (why only 2?).

The pain and complications of reading the rules and especially dealing with the 'beginner setup' degrades my rating at least a point, and more for the poor components. Next time please hire a technical writer who speaks English!

Take off another rating point for the crapacious board. How many times are people going to bid on the wrong component because of the stupid inconsistent placement of the bidding boxes? I told myself that I'd never make the mistake of bidding for the wrong item.... but then when it happened to me I immediately pasted up the board then and there (I *hate* having to paste up an 'english' game).

That I had to print out 5 new enlarged player aids is unforgivable! The 2 (only 2??) included are TINY and hard to read if you're above 40. Sheesh.

The game is good in its own right. The problems with the production are too much work for me.

Very clever and strategic. It is incredible important to build your engine and toplan carefully for the last 2 turns else your are going no where (like me). It is an easy game to play but tough to explain for the first time. I'm not sure if I like how we resolve when we have build an invention at the same time. I think an open auction would be better. Must definitely play again!

Update: second play confirm the inevitable. This is a real gamer's games. So 2 players in our game group loved it. And 2 other players didn't like it very much. Games are very unforgiving. Each decisions is very critical so if you don't pay attention to what resources you need and whate invention you need to build you will lose badly. This is not a good game for casual player.

Somehow this game has a feeling of Princes of Florence about it. The gameplay isn't very similar, and it's not the Italian theme either, but somehow, this game feels very remeniscent of Princes. I think that it has alot to do with having to collect various components to complete inventions for points. Money is points and points are money. There are a few other things in the game that bring that same air as well; and that's a good thing.

That being said, I very much like this game. There is so much to do in so little time.

I love the theme, I like the bits, and the mechanisms are interesting and work well.  I particularly like the way that worker placement is modified so that you can always get what you absolutely need, provided that you are willing to pay more for it.   

BUT

having played this admittedly only three times, I am very concerned that your success or failure depends to such a large extent on what other people have chosen to do, and that you have little way of judging that.  It's like a race game where everyone's starting at slightly different points and you're not sure who if anyone, you're racing against and how far they might have got.

WP games are all about frustration, to an extent, but this one seems to put it in the wrong place, somehow- you're frustrated at the end of what you set out to do, or  worse still in the middle, and you have no real option at that point to change course or modify the damage.

Very steeply penalizes missteps and is not easy to teach/learn.  I think it requires at least one play to have a good grasp of what to do, and it seems rather arbitrary and annoying to me.

It felt like a mishmash of random mechanics and fiddly bits, like something a couple of German game designers would come up with as a bar bet, not intending it to be a serious game.

Played twice. The game has two parts: one auction game that works fairly well, and a less satisfying one of project planning.

A problem with the invention cards is that you choose projects in secret, and you can be randomly punished if you pick the wrong one. Also, planning for the end game seems very important, and timing problems are hard to predict and hard to compensate for.

Aside from heavy analysis paralysis and luck-based competition avoidance, it seems rather good, though.

Lots of agonizing decisions in this one. Reminds me of a mix of Pillars of the Earth and Princes of Florence. Those who dislike luck in their games should like this one - the only randomness is in which inventions are available each turn to be built, but even this can be mitigated by playing into the Council and choosing the option that allows you to examine and rearrange the top cards.

I hated this game the first time I played it (and rated it a 3), but that was awhile ago, so when my friends wanted to play again I thought I'd give it another shot.  I enjoyed it much more the second time around.  Definitely not a good game for new gamers (the rules were too complex for my Monopoly-indoctrinated brain the first time around).  Still not one of my favorites, but I won't mind a play every now and again.

It’s an older worker placement where you actually build stuff, so that’s cool. The theme is there and it has automated men (not robots!), which is fun. The timing mechanic of building stuff and using multiple workers tradeoff with gathering resources is great. 

The randomness of the things to be built is fine – until the last 2 rounds. Booooo! This just blows when whatever pops up requires resources you don’t have and now can’t get. Seriously, ruins the whole game. 

On the good side the board and components are nice and the game doesn’t take too long to play. It’s unique and not too hard to teach so I should probably bring it out more but that endgame screw just has me bitter.

An interesting worker placement with some neat mechanics and player influence. The rules are TERRIBLY written and needed a lot of help from BGG before being able to teach this to others. My wife is a planner and the player influence in this game thwarted her plans the first two times we played. Rather than accepting this concept as a mechanism in the game and using it to her advantage, she took this concept used against her personally. Subsequently, we don't play this anymore.

>5 plays. Very smart game. Good planning is needed. I was afraid that this was again one of these rather solitary games in which you just try to optimize your own score, without that having much consequences for your opponents (I mean Princes of Florence, Puerto Rico, Pillars of the earth, Notre Dame etc.). But I was wrong: this game has plenty of interaction, it is great fun, but a brain burner. Also plays well with two: less tense, but also less frustrating.

Terrific game.  I love "Princes of Florence," but it can seem a bit like solitaire for five.  I really like "Caylus." but it really takes longer than I like.  This has great player interaction and a much shorter play time.  The mechanics are quite fresh, fun and clever.  Ramp up is surprisingly not terribly steep, but it will take a little explaining.  This one had us talking about what we could have done better, long after the game was over.  Some good "aha!" moments and even a few laughs.  A new favorite of our group.

Have now played this once with the wife where we were both figuring it out.  Liked it very well and will play again.  We like Puerto Rico and it feels similar.  Also, the wife is a trained and degreed classical musician - this title appeals to her.  Imagining myself to be a bit of a Renaissance man (though not like Leonardo), I too am intrigued by this game.  My ranking may well change after a few more plays.  Worker placement has become MEH in my opinion.

After first play with a prototype--I enjoyed the game a lot. Certainly a gamer's game. I would prefer only one extra building turn at the end instead of two. Overall, this is a winner!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: There's always that 'not enough actions to do everything' feeling. Very simple to explain and grasp. Plays fast.
Cons: The automatons seem overpowered. Simplish gameplay, as there are really only 5 different actions that can be selected from round to round (acquire new ressources, 1rst player, new meeples, upgrade lab, work in lab) -- therefore gets repetitive really fast. Also prone to frustrating randomness in the workshop items you can work on (objectives); not knowing who is working on what adds tension but also unecessary frustration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game to make hard-core euro fans drool.  It has a great auction mechanic where players take turn placing their followers onto different areas of the board to claim resources, more workers, new laboratories, robots (to help build the inventions) etc.  Whoever has the most followers wins the item for free, the other players invested must pay 2 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd place, etc., If there's a tie whoever placed first wins the tie.  There are a number of different routes to winning.  I'm apprehensive about the following: like Princes of Florence and Power Grid, to a degree, there's a huge end-game that you need to build for.  You really need to micro-manage your resources in order to come up on top and need to have the flexibility of resources and perhaps some luck that the high-scoring inventions that require the resources you have on-hand will come up at the very end.  I thought I had a strong showing in my first game but the end-game killed my chances of winning as I made a couple of small miscalculations.  My other concern is that like POF and Puerto Rico this is one of those games that's probably going to have a fairly formulaic strategy that hopefully the auctions will help even-out.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My own prejudice shines through: I probably think this game is heavier than it really is, mostly due to my own struggles with it.  Very much a 'gamer's game', although this lends itself to some inevitable analysis paralysis.  While I'm not normally afflicted by such, this game tends to bring it out.  Otherwise, there is a great balance of maximizing limited actions to bring about maximum benefit.  Bidding mechanism makes for good player interaction.

First impressions of this one are very good.

There are elements of a lot of other games here, but it all blends together quite nicely.

The worker placement and tie-breaker is a little like Caylus, the increasing costs for the inventions remind me of Goa, there's an area-majority element, there is a (very) limited number of rounds (like Princes of Florence) and so every move must be of use.

I tend to gamble on what's coming up, and it hasn't once paid off!

I like the fact that the player with the most money is the winner, so the fact that you have to pay for most things means that you're spending your points.

After a couple of game, we switched to the varied set-up. I much prefer this, as I intend to try out a few different ideas.

The game gives you the feeling of struggling all the way through, without making it obvious that others are too, and you're actually better placed than you thought.

Great stuff.

I found this for cheap and couldn't resist.  It goes to show that one shouldn't buy games just to buy games.  I think I remember needing a nice, tall glass of water after this game, because it was so terribly DRY!  I think that if I had played this 5 years ago, I might have been rather impressed, but with all the new games and interesting mechanics out there now, this title really shows its age at the table.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent game wherein players must use workers to acquire resources and do work in their laboratory in order to be the first build inventions requested by the master of the city.  

There are many cool mechanics all working together in this game. Inventions require a number of "research weeks," which are obtained by placing workers in your lab for a given number of turns; players secretly choose which inventions they're working on, meaning that players can be building the same inventions at the same time (the player who builds it first gets a bonus).  To get resources and other useful items, workers must be placed into specific areas of the the city in an area-influence game (the player with the most workers in an area, or the first player into an area if there are ties, gets the item for free; others must pay if they want the items).  Victory is determined solely by money, however, so paying to buy resources and upgrades requires a lot of thought.

This game requires both tactical thinking and strategic planning, and includes a high amount of player interaction (competition for spaces in the city, competition for building an invention first, etc.).  The game goes for 9 turns, and turn 7 (the last turn where resources can be bought) is brutal.

The game feels very different with two or three vs. five players; with five players the competition for resources is tremendous, while with two three players the board is much more open.  It's equally fun at all sizes, which is great.

Klasszikus munkáslehelyezős, ötletes mechanizmusokkal, gyorsan átlátható lehetőségekkel.

A játék ezek alapján lehetne nagyon jó, de fogyatékosságai miatt inkább csak a jó szintjén maradt:
 - unalmas a hangulata, olyan álmos bábutologatásnak, -pakolgatásnak tűnik a játékmenet;
 - előzővel valószínűleg összefügg: alacsony interakciós szint;
 - dizájn a jó öreg kilencvenes évek (kb. mint a Caylus első kiadása).

Mi ketten játszottunk vele, speckó három játékos szimulálással, kb. visszaadta a három játékos játékmenetét.

Összegzésül: jó-jó, de ennél azért vannak már jobb játékok is (néhány évvel ezelőtt nagyobbat szólt volna, ha akkor akadok rá, de így 2017 vége felé már kevésnek érzem).

Had a so-so experience with a demo of this a few Gen Cons ago. Got it for a low price at CoolStuffInc, will give it another go.

After setting it up and running a simulated play to get the hang of it, it seems like a very cool game, much better than I remember. 2 factors are at work: 1. The person teaching the game at Gen Con did a bad job. 2. I'm much more familiar with board games in general now, so it's easier to pick up on things.

I like Leo DaVinci, more than my wife I think. Of course, it's a worker placement game and I seem to excel at those...

Updated 2/25/16:  Sadly, this game has not aged well over the past 10 years.  The worker placement, resource gathering, cash in resources for victory points idea has been done so many different ways and most often so much cleaner that Leonardo is no longer among one of my favorites.  In my most recent play, a couple of things went wrong for three of the four players.  We allowed one player to get ahead in acquiring extra apprentices. From that point on, he was able to maintain control of Leonardo, win  the council, place his council apprentice as needed to win another area.  There was much we could do to slow him down.  Also the bidding for the invention cards was annoying, especially to those losing the bid.  Some of the mechanics, such as pointing an arrow at a completed invention, just seemed like an odd design choice.

Outdated verbiage:  After one play with our gaming group, I immediately went out and bought my own copy.  Turns out we had several rules wrong that first time but even that game was lots of fun.  With the right rules this game really shines.  This is a meaty game which requires lots of long term planning much like in two of my favorites, Power Grid and Princes of Florence.  I have only played with five players and that seems like an optimal number to ensure lots of contention for the key city areas.

This game is intentionally designed to run rampant over people who prefer "hidden trackable" information to be open [I'm close to being one of those sorts of people] rather than concealed. If it bothers you [even in the slightest], this game will drive you bonkers. 

I felt most of my decisions were made "in the dark" because there were things I would have liked to know [number of cards put into each invention stack, for instance] that would have very clearly made decision-making more meaningful. Interesting system, though.

An older game that certainly feels old. A novel area majority worker placement game is hemmed by pedestrian set collection and a cruel dirth of early game money that can set a player behind all game.

Fun bidding & production game, played twice.  As i suspected the player who picked extra apprentices (biddig chips) at the beginning won both games.  I tried alternative strategies and came in 2nd both times by some distance.  Much more interesting in 5 than 3.  Guessing game dynamic where 2 people could be going for the same goal and not know until they both complete it.  Better off guessing what other people won't be doing.  Will play again quite a few times.  *New* OK never mind the apprentice complaint.  If everyone grabs extra apprentices, the game really tightens up.  Everyone spent a lot of money in the last game we played, and then didn't have the resources to build enough at the end.  This game is intriguing.

Another game like Caylus where you try to out position you opponents turn after turn although this is shorter and more to the point (and shorter) giving it a higher rating for me.  Nice design.  Wish the inventions were highlighted more so you knew what you were inventing....I like theme alot and this is not bad but could be even better.

In Renaissance Italy, choose inventions to work on, then assign workers to various parts of the city to gather resources (such as more laboratories, more workers, components) then produce the inventions. It's a very good strategy game. When you compete for resources, you play down tokens into an area. The person who has the highest number of tokens there gets the action for free, second place pays $2, third pays $3, so you do not lose everything. This game rewards a bit of planning, some luck in that you and your opponents do not produce the same invention, and very restricted resources. There are many tough decisions to make on whether to upgrade your lab, get more workers, get more components, etc, while your opponents are competing for the same things. Early games have clocked in just under the 2 hr mark. I really want to like this game, but if you happen to produce an invention simultaneously with another person, then you get less money and have to bid for the rights to the card. That allows people without conflicting inventions to pull ahead, and the situation gets worse if you get three people working on the same invention. These situations may detract from the game where it is no longer enjoyable.

Extremely promising gamers' game. Yes, it's got a similar feel as Caylus in terms of area majority, hardly any luck (Trying to make preemptive investments does not work), but it's less brainburn (still burns), does not feel overbalanced, feels a bit more interactive (not least through the marvellously frustrating hidden bidding system) and fantastically it's got...faster play. The game is in innovation lingo, not a radical innovation, it's incremental, it combines old elements to create an slipstreamed entity. Most importantly, it works. The endgame is, in my opinion a bit rushed. Th English rules are not the best so head for the FAQs on the publishers site. Finally... gotta love the theme.

Lots going on here and some very nice ideas, but this was a case where the game just didn't win me over (despite winning by a fairly large amount). I don't think it's a bad game by any means, but I just didn't have that much fun while I was playing it. I'd certainly be willing to try this again with a different group to see if my opinion changes.

RATING: 5
Clever engine-building game with a well integrated auction component.  The theme is very secondary in this one (VERY) but the system is pretty fun to play in.  Heavy feel of Princes of Florence in timing your endgame but much more tactical up to that point as you try to guage the table and get the best bang for your buck.  Biggest negative on the game is the production.  Some parts are over-produced while others just make no sense.  The biggest offender, IMO, is the icons - VERY difficult to distinguish without familiarity with the game, and even then can give you trouble.  Rating of 7 after one play with likely upward potential.

----update---
Getting hosed by the board layout/ambiguous icons SUCKS.  Still hanging at 7.  Jury still out.

--update--
Okay...I've decided.  I don't like it.  Worker-allocation is the hot new trend in design and has been done much better elsewhere.  The scoring just feels off.  Tacked on to the aforementioned issues with the layout and icons, Leo hits 6, and may even bottom out at 5.

Very nice game, but nothing altogether unique here.  One totally superficial comment:  The board is totally uninspired and borderline ugly (as if Mrs. Parkinson's grade three art class had a hand in it).

The game feels like it should take less time because there's a quickness to it. And perhaps it takes a bit too long for the amount of fun it provides.  Put another way, the game feels smaller (simpler) than the sum of its parts. Ultimately, it's kind of forgettable because of that -- a 45-minute game that takes 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Too, it did not feel similar to Princes of Florence as I had thought it might.

RATING: 6.5
An otherwise-standard worker-placement game with 'soft' blocking; if you get blocked, you can pay to take the action (or get less money for completing a work). This makes it less harsh, but it is terrible if you run out of cash.

I enjoyed my one play, but might have enjoyed it a little bit more if it hadn't taken 4 hours.

This game mixes bidding for resources with resource management in a unique way. You're racing to complete inventions while trying not to spend too much. You need to balance saving money with staying in competition.

RATING: 6
First impression (5 players): There is probably a bit too much hitting of other players with 5 players. That and it adds downtime to already pretty long game. Four players should be the optimum number and after this game it feels like it.

About the game itself I must say that there are some pretty harsh features there. One of them being the endgame where you need to have enough resources to build some of the big things at the end as they produce big points (or other way around: you need to use your resources to build them). Also the way resources are bought can hurt you a lot if you happen to get kicked by one/two other players.

I still liked the game although it will have some hard time finding it's way to table next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Only two plays. Feel the whole game a bit messy and the end game inelegant, and overall dull. Yet it seems perfectly balanced and expert version looks interesting. For now it's a disappointment from what I have been expecting (probably too much).
[EDIT]Each new game has been boring for me, I tried to like this game... and just failed. I feel like you hide luck (draw of cards even with the council power) and chaos (the fact of being annoyed or not by others) behind complexity. I just don't feel the balance of control you have over the game and simply don't enjoy the goals (while doing works in Princes of Florence for doing money/points to do other works is tense, here it's not). Not sure I want to play it again :(
[EDIT]Tried one last time at 3 players. Far less frustrating though I don't want to play it anymore now (4 games total).

Proprio un bel gioco, non del tutto originale ma nel complesso profondo. Avvincente anche la tematica che vuole tutte le invenzioni/costruzioni essere effettivamente delle idee di Leonardo Da Vinci. Le carte quick reference anticipano l'ordine delle care che usciranno (almeno i gruppi) diminuendo notevolmente l'alea e costringendo negli ultimi turni di gioco a delle valutazioni molto ben precise (potrebbe essere controproducente con dei pensatori lenti). Un bel gioco, forse alla lunga ripetitivo, ma da provare.

This game gives me a headache whenever I play it. It's MUCH more of a brain burner than any other game we play because you constantly have to re-evaluate what you are doing and why. Unlike Caylus, planning ahead is critical in this game.

The mechanics: it has some Caylus flavour in it, but much more stressful since the chosen location can be easily stolen by other players. It forces you to do a lot of pre-planning to avoids remaining with your lab empty, expecially in the last turns. You will pay for every little mistake, since 7 turns go very quickly.

The theme: the idea of people working in the lab is great, but building Leonardo's inventions seems more like working in a restaurant's kitchen than in the genius' lab... You never have the impression of working on AN INVENTION.

What I like:
- Interesting use of time (person-weeks)
- You can't get locked out of a space--you just have to pay more
- Seems to move along pretty quickly (60 minutes for a solo 2p learning game)

What I don't like:
- Placing more on a space can get nasty
- The game seems to be a lot about jostling for space on the board, which is not my preferred type of game
- Graphical design is not ideal
- Rules are ambiguous and/or unclear in spots

This game has a bit of a Caylus feel in its sequentially activated spaces, and tight resources. It is more forgiving because multiple players can go in a spot, but is perhaps equally unforgiving from a timing standpoint. LdV is fairly random and chaotic, and has a memorization aspect, along with some optional bluffing. 

The rules are really quite simple (once you learn them correctly by studying the forum and FAQ in addition to the rulebook), but there appears to be quite a bit of depth. I think the 3.2 voted weight is too high--I would put it more like 2.8 (a bit lower than Caylus Magna Carta).

The interaction between the players is non stop. It is a pain when you don't complete an invention first, but that is part of the game. The worst part is definitely explaining it. There are a lot of intricacies and it always takes two or three rounds for people to get the hang of it. The last two rounds also seem like a waste, where you just develop, I would prefer it end before those two rounds.

Many people classify this as a worker placement game, but it's really more of an area majority mechanic.  The key to this game is being on a different schedule than your opponents, because when everyone tries to do the same thing at once, it gets really expensive.  Timing is everything, really.  However, sometimes it's a little difficult to make your plans because you don't know what inventions are coming, though this makes the peeking-and-rearranging function more powerful than people realize.

RATING: 6
Great entry in the catalogue of worker-placement games. With only 7 turns to set up labs, gather components, and ensure successful inventions in the final two rounds coupled with sharp competition for actions, this game is very tense and unforgiving. Owing to the random order/requirements for different inventions, the game is more tactical than Princes of Florence, but there are definitely strategic decisions to be made. Going for mechanical men early seems to be a very strong strategy, but can be overly expensive if everyone chooses to do so. Overall, very fun and engaging.

There is something of a random screwage element that can arise if one player has a disproportionate number of inventions sniped. Perhaps there are ways to play that will avoid this, but I suspect they would rely on an unreasonably accurate recollection of other player's past resource choices.

Some unique mechanics that work quite nicely, the week-schedule makes you feel like you're really inventing, there's lots of agonizing decision, and it's very balanced.  And there's really not much resemeblence to "Princes of Florence".  

But...you spend like 80% of the game involved in the core placement mechanic, and it gets very boring and repetitive quickly ("Mykerinos" has the same problem).   And the whole game felt kinda clunky, the rule book had some issues too.  It just doesn't feel like a polished game.  Plus the whole end game was a big crapshoot, you double your score with one card or you screw up and lose miserably.   But still needs more plays...

Ok, I've owned this game for well over 4 months. 

I'm agonizing to play this game, but it's extremely difficult for me to find some interest in this game with my immediate circle of friends and family.  Reason?  The game looks, and somewhat is, complicated as heck as far as Eurogames go.  I haven't even played it completely, aside from setting up a few solitaire rounds, and already I feel as though I am one of the mechanical robots in the game, looking for the 'nuts and bolts' of this truly 'machine-building' game, Leonardo da Vinci. 

I want someone to show me how awesome this game is, because for me, if it's 'awesome' - it's 'awesome' wrapped in an enigma, enveloped in a question, shrouded in a secret, and held in a riddle.

RATING: 6
Although fun to play, I find the game fiddly and I feel there is a big random (luck) element in the very last round, which can swing the game to a player through no genius of their own. The very last invention cards that are turned up go to the players who happen to have the right combination of resources left in their hand. Something that is very difficult to plan for. Of course two mechanical workers are probably needed to be able to satisfy the worker requirement (11-15).

Most of the mechanics in the game are similar to the mechanics in Caylus and Luis XIV. Leonardo doesn't even come close to the level of Caylus or even Luis, but it can be fun to play, although I think the ending may be a problem.

RATING: 5
Based on one play, this game uses a lot of the mechanics I enjoy--worker placement, area majority, building economic engine--but somehow didn't come out as a favourite in any of those categories. There was a small but noticeable memory element. The pieces and graphics are really nicely done. The "Lord of the City" is spectacularly useless but amusing. Likely to improve with more plays as the relative importance of city spaces is not readily apparent and the game is unforgiving of mistakes in prioritization.

Rather basic worker placement. The last rounds are not too interesting as it's possible to completely wreck one's game by not having the resources for the last works, especially if the last set of works consists of mostly works that cannot be finished in one turn.

I don't really know what to say.  I thought the timing aspect of producing inventions was really cool, especially when combined with the area majority aspect of getting goods in town.

On the other hand, I've played Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Caylus and Goa.  Leonardo Da Vinci is very much in the same sub-genre as these other economic efficiency games.  While I don't think the game is particularly deriviative, it's going up against some pretty tough competition.  Is it good enough to forgo playing one of those other games instead?  We'll see.

Looked and felt like it was designed by a committee of Italians.  It lacks the spirit and charm that goes with some Italian designer's projects, and it lacks the polish and care lavished on other collaborations.  

Instead it felt like a mess, with a number of really clunky rules.  Colosseum is a similar sort of game that plays much better.

RATING: 8.2
Very reminiscent of Caylus in style of play. You have a limited number of workers and have to make very tough decisions on where to place them. Very little luck, and even that is controllable (at a cost). Due to an excellent game mechanic, there is much more player interaction, since players compete in what is essentially an 'area control game' for actions each turn. I like this game very much, despite playing it very badly, and after further plays I expect my rating to rise to match or even exceed my rating for Caylus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Worker placement game that is good, but not great.  The game suffers a bit from a lack of scoring options/multiple paths to victory.  This makes the game somewhat two dimensional as there is only really one path to victory--score first and often. With a bigger variety of scoring options, the choices a given player would be forced to make would be much harder to make and possibly more interesting. As it is, sometimes you just get hosed, and your turn ends up wasted, or there is sometimes nothing worthwhile for you to do if you're already invested in a couple of inventions. Using your turn to pick up random material components is kind of a ho-hum experience. The last couple of "research rounds" are kind of gamey and weird, and I'm not sure the set collection mechanism is that well thought out. This all said, the game is enjoyable to play. I don't find it as complex as some make it out to be. Despite one or two rules exceptions here and there, the game is very intuitive and straight forward. For right now I'm rating this a 7 as I'm curious enough about the game to get it to the table, but I can see my rating falling down to a 6 or maybe even a 5 in the future. The basic fact is that there are already a decent number of games in the niche Leonardo occupies that are much better than it, that the game will probably end up an idea or two short of maintaining long term replayability.

Update: meh.

My first game was a complete blow-out.  90 to 32.  I think its interesting though and will probably raise with learned competitive players; it really is quite similar to Ys in game feel and play even though the mechanics are largely different.

Played a couple games 'today' and I had to up my opinion of it a lil bit.  I'm not sure if its going to stay up because the game is pretty light, but it is fun.  

After just playing a four player game, the dynamic of the game changes quite a bit with more or less players.  With four players play was much more aggressive.  This is a very fast, very light game, comparable in depth to Notre Dame.

RATING: 7
Reminiscent of Princes of Florence, where you have sharply limited time and resources to accomplish just a few works/inventions. Good player interaction, lots to think about. This is a decent worker placement game, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd. I think you can get a similar and better experience from other games.

Played this once so far and enjoyed it.  Nice worker placement game.  Unfortunately, I don't feel like I will get to test out its full potential, as I rarely play with more than 2 players.  Seems like a game that would shine with 3 or 4. 

Update : I have been able to play this a few more times.  Its a solid game, but a little vanilla for me.  I am big on theme, and this game seems a bit mechanical to me.  Bottom line, I got a good deal on it, so I am happy to have it in my collection.  It will likely be passed over for other games most of the time though.

Strongly-themed gamer's game with original elements -- not too complicated but satisfying, overall. Requires at least one-turn-ahead planning, which is good if you consider the vast wealth of strictly tactical "do what you can right now" games out there. The invention cards are not only beautiful, they're also a good homage to Renaissance creativity and Leonardo's genius in particular.

Pretty easy to learn and its a fun race to see who can invent each thing the fastest.  The big downside is that there is one way to score points and if you don't plan right you can really do poorly.

House Rule:  New inventions get flipped up at the end of Turn 8.

Also thinking about different type-bonus of:
1 type = 0 Florins
2 types = 2 Florins
3 types = 8 Florins
4 types = 14 Florins
5 types = 20 Florins

Update: There are so many better worker placement games out there.

RATING: 7
A simple worker placement game with a bit of a twist. Getting the resources you want can be done by placing more workers (thus depriving yourself of actions) OR by paying money (and perhaps a combination). But in this game money and victory points are the same thing. Its quite unusual to have a game that spends victory points and it creates an interesting dynamic.
Otherwise everything is pretty standard - collect resources, add improvements, use resources and improvements to collect victory point cards. Light enough to teach quickly, interesting enough to hold attention.

A clever auction mechanic (a sort of area-control-auction...) make this game one of my favourites. Use your worker to buy at the lowest price goods, to hire new men or to improve your laboratories with more working space or mechanical men. And, at the same time, use your workers and mechanical men to create inventions in your laboratories. Great art, great components.

I generally like worker placement games, and I like the area majority twist that this one adds. I also generally like set collecting games and this one has you collecting sets of materials for your inventions. I just felt underwhelmed by the dryness of it all- this game isn't fun to play, nor are there many interesting choices- and at the same time overwhelmed by the complexity of the rules- which, as written, are very dense, poorly organized and hard to understand.

Rating down a bit after a second play.  I just found it to be a bit too much work for the amount of fun it offered.  THe game is very unforgiving, and I don't want to have to bear down hard for two hours to avoid making any mistakes at all (such as being one dollar short on one turn) just to have a chance when the cards turn in the last turn.  If it were shorter and a little more forgiving, I'd be more excited.  EDIT:  Further play confirms the above.

Not a bad game but too much an inflexible strategy game for my tastes. Money is so tight that plans have to be well implemented for any sense of forward progress. The last 5 turns of the game are a setup for the endgame which ended up boring me a bit. And be careful you don't make one dumb mistake as the game is very unforgiving in this regard. It does flow well after you learn the steps, but the amount of input seems to be far greater than what returns in fun and satisfaction.

I really liked the game play and the theme.  On my first play it seemed to break down a little at the end as you wanted to have the right good to start a invention on the last few rounds but you seem to need to get lucky to do so.  Maybe more play and knowledge of the inventions would mitigate this, it is not clear to me.

Looking forward to exploring with varied player numbers. I find the rules to be somewhat ambiguous in parts, but not impossible to come to a logical decision about.

The main mechanic of this game is based on worker placement, similar to [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602]Caylus[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22545]Age of Empires III:  The Age of Discovery[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34635]Stone Age[/i][/url], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27364]Caylus Magna Carta[/i][/url] and they say that [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24480]Pillars of the Earth[/i][/url] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/30957]Tribune: Primus Inter Pares[/i][/url].  Nevertheless it is a bit more complex that those others.  That turns it into a difficult game to play well.  All actions have to be planified and the interaction with other players makes this matter hard to reach.  Speaking of other things, it could be felt a kind of lack of originality in its design, because its similarities with the said games, even when it is in so many ways different of the others.

This game comes across as a well-balanced tight game. But, it suffers significantly from "just another Euro" syndrome. The game plays dry and largely uninteresting.

Rarely has a thematic idea and a mechanical execution fitted so well - this is such a perfectly engineered game that Leonardo himself would have been proud.  Has gone down a point for me now though for two reasons: sometimes you feel that the game is playing you, and secondly, if you miss out on being first with an invention, it seems much too difficult to rebuild your lost tempo unless you are lucky with the next round of cards.

12/8/06: 2nd?/5 (maybe 3rd) - I played pretty badly. I don't think I like this game very much.

12/7/06: 3rd/3 - When completing an invention I noticed I'd put the wrong cards down. This took me out of the game with no possibility to recover. This has left a bad taste in my mouth, I don't know if a game so unforgiving of a mistake is really my kind of game. I don't suspect this would happen too often though, so maybe my rating will increase after another play or 2. For now I rate it a 6.

Leonardo da Vinci -- Played once; four-player.  Must... play... again.  

In Leonardo da Vinci, gold is Victory Points.  When an inventor completes his research for a particular card he receives money.  The ability to keep the card for a completed invention offers two additional benefits: 1) decreased work-time to complete research in the same category; and 2) a potential game-end gold bonus for variety of collected categories.  When two inventors finish their research for the same card at the same time, they bid for ownership of the card (and its benefits).  

Of the various lessons I learned about this game as we played, the key tidbit was that when bidding, never bid so much that you negate the game-end bonus.  If you have to pay that much, then you might as well forego the card and both its benefits altogether.  The work-time benefit reduces required units by two, so it's nice but not necessary.  And the gold you get for completing the card is too useful to squander in bidding.

Of course, if you pay attention to what your opponents are collecting, you may anticipate which inventions they'll pursue, and avoid the bidding dilemma entirely.  

Of course, there were other important lessons:  
-Because you're likely to have to pay some non-first-place prices, plan to complete inventions frequently, as they're the only way to garner appreciable income.
-Gain apprentices, improve factories, and collect mechanical men early.  This not only helps ensure income, but frees up your midgame for gathering resources in preparation for the final two rounds.

I found the game unaccountably (but pleasantly) tense -- the game is very involving.

This is a great game of efficiency, there are a ton of little decisions that remain fun all the way to the end of the game.  Tension runs high as you start going head to head trying to get resources, along with the added bonus seat wiggler pushing to get the invetions.  

While there are a number of things that a Euro fan will like about this game, I personally have an especially fond attatchment to the game from the useless lord of the city piece.  We give it to the person that wins the council and then they get to tell everyone that they are Lord of the City that turn.

People that love the long heavier Euro should like this, those that don't will hate it.  I suspect that this will be a big hit, I absolutely can't wait to play this again.  Only play this with the advanced set up.  BTW, 60-90 minutes is a joke with this.

I don't know what is going on with Essen 2006 but I feel this game was a bit overhyped as well. Don't get me wrong, I had fun playing it, but nothing really new here: resource management with a bit of bidding. I thought the catch up on bid mechanic was neat (lets you not get boxed out of options but comes at a steep price) and the robot workers was a nice touch. But if I am going to play a screw you game, and believe me this game was all about messing with everyone on the board, I think I would rather play Richard Breese's Keythedral. The production values of the board, cards and markers was also very JV. I have taken off my wishlist.

RATING: 7
Somewhat reminiscent of Louis XIV mechanics in placement of tokens for majorities to get resources, followed by a chance to cash them in for points.  Caylus-like upgrading of buildings (labs) and "I got there first" placement for ties, plus a favors track in the form of the council and placement of workers for first place.  
Three features I did like, that I think are unique for games of this genre:  1)secretly competing for completion of a project.  You may be the only one working on something, but...?  Speaking as someone in science, this is spot on. 2)The option to keep purchasing resources/upgrades if you have the money and a worker in the area.  3) the tech bonus that reduces the time you have to spend on similar projects balanced by the variety bonus for completing works in different areas.

I'd like to try it again, but I'm not exactly chomping at the bit.

Fun and thematic game that fiendishly couples worker allocation with bidding for resources.  Lots of choices and possible strategy paths, requiring nimble willingness to switch plans as the other players get in your way.  Never enough workers, enough time, enough anything, and I always seem to pick the same inventions to build as three other people.  Cracks me up that the masters (aka profs) are twice as productive in the lab as the assistants (aka grad students).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A bit difficult to learn, but definitely a fun one.  The primary mechanic is an auction system, so it gets high marks from me for that.  I also enjoy how you have to work to build your inventions and there are numerous ways to get to build the best invention.  Nice player contention on limited resources, but definitely needs to be played with at least 4 to get good drama.

UPDATE: After getting to play it a second time, while I'd say that I liked it, I can't say that it really was as compelling with the second play.  Still a quality game, though.

It seems like this ought to be a good game - has lots of interesting stuff from an area-control type auction, to tactical planning, to resource development (need money to buy stuff; need stuff to make inventions, which get you more money), a neat work-completion method %u2026 and it even plays pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I found it somewhat repetitive (placing workers), frustrating (don%u2019t know who%u2019s working on what; hard to plan), long (I would prefer Mykerinos or Erde, which feel slightly similar), and the basic setup is annoying (lots of fiddling with cards, variable setup based on turn order).

Scales well from 3 to 5; good but not great with 2. [Area Majority, Resource Management, Action Optimization, Auctions, high strategy/tactic, low luck] The only game I actually hated.

I have some problems in talking about this one. It's an area control game, with clever mechanics, but it turns to be a bit awkward. The original setup is a mystery. Does it work? I'll have to play in all positions on the table to tell.

Another thing is that the game seems to be a bit longer than it should.

Player interaction has increased with each game as we are far more informed about the relative  importance of each particular action now. There is also an excellent feeling of angst when deciding how many apprentices to place in each section.

Meh. Another dry and abstract worker placement game. I like Caylus and Agricola, but this didn't do it for me. Has some things going for it, but acquiring extra workers/robots at the start of the game is much too important. Anyone who loses out there will certainly lose the game.

This game left me feeling like it was trying to be another princes of florence, but it came closer to being another goa.  The once around 'auction' takes much from the game, and though I just played the 'beginner' game, I had the feeling that with my options there was no chance at winning based solely of starting resources.  I've not played a game that I found this boring in quite some time.  I will not be playing this game again.

Some theme.  Game is easy to learn and play.  Worker placement mechanic has a couple of twists which are interesting.  Many choices to make during a turn.  However, the last two game turns are anti-climatic & dull without the worker placement aspect.  The invention type victory condition also seems unbalancing.  The components are very good - mounted board, thick cardboard chits, & durable cards.  Rulebook has some examples but could be written better.  Artwork is fair at best.  Game time is good at just over an hour.

A bunch of simple mechanisms that have been done before--and better--elsewhere, cobbled together with some ugly memory or knowing-the-game-ahead-of-time elements.

Tough one to rate,  I like this game,  but it somehow feels incomplete.  It seems insanely difficult to gather enough resources,  and then many times you are collecting resources blindly hoping a matching invention will be revealed. I can see the intelligence behind this design,  but it just seems that this game will only work with good gamers.  A true "gamers games" as the game can be ruined by a player randomly pursuing a resource you desperately need, only to see them finish the game without using that resource.

This rating could very well go up with repeated plays but after two plays, while I think there's probably a very good game in here, I'll be darned if I can grasp it.  I've lost terribly each time I've played and I really can't say for sure exactly why (although I have some rough ideas).  It's a production game and so one misstep early can snowball into a dismal result.  I can't see any reliable way to catch a leader.

I will start from what I will change: card graphic which should be done with much more visibility for material icon (bigger than this). Acchittocca has done a great job with this game, anyway this game is too "heavy" for my taste. I feel really exausted after finishing one game, even if it's a german game not so difficult to learn. Probably it depends by the balance of many resource you have to manage (material, labs, robot, worker, coin).

Played this game twice with my monthly game group.  The first game we discovered I had made a couple of mistakes in teaching and we played again at the next meeting with everything corrected.

I enjoyed both plays, but I also know the regulars I play with would prefer something just a notch less in brain intensity.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - Owned it but hadn't played it so signed up to play a game with 5. Similar resource management game to others, I think, but some interesting twists with initial costs of 0 for resources the, 2,3 and 4. You can come over the top of someone and make them pay if they want it. Also, the ability to take an action to move workers it a nice twist. Contention for the same inventions with the first person creating it being given an advantage for efficiencies building future inventions makes you think carefully about how to balance your workers. There are lots of options here and everyone starts out with different combinations of resources and labs, so it will always be a little different depending on what order you start in. Want to play it more now! Even convinced myself to up the rating after reading my own comments ;)

I really like Leonardo Da Vinci.  There are so many aspects of the game to juggle around at once, and yet it all seems very intuitive.  There is a race-like nature to the inventions which keeps the players on the edge of their seats.  There are three resources (cards, workers, and money), and managing them all at once is tricky to the point of being impossible, and yet fascinating at the same time.  I like this game right from the intro, in which the players choose which stuff they will start the game with.  Good stuff.

I like how the game moves right along, even with 5 players. We jumped right into the expert setup for our first two games, so we didn't necessarily know the best items to take for our favors, but advanced setup is the way to go moving forward. Seems like there a number of strategies to be pursued, so I think the group will give the game lots of play before burnout/solving happens.

RATING: 8
This is a very solid offering, but I'm not sure it will rise into my pantheon of elite games. It has, however, improved from an initial 7 rating to a current rating of 8 following repeated play. I love the bidding mechanisms, and there is definitely quite a bit of tension regarding whether you should use your limited resources in the bids or completing inventions. Still, something here feels a tad fiddly and perhaps a bit less streamlined and/or polished than it could be for some reason. That's obviously a very subjective statement, but nevertheless this game has given me this feeling each time I've played. Still, while not perfect, there is a LOT going on and this is a "gamer's game" worth trying! Be forewarned, though ... this game has a high degree of screwage in the bidding and should be avoided by those who don't enjoy a healthy dollop of conflict in their gaming experience.

Neat stuff going on.  Gather influence by having majorities.  Ties broken by first one in, that seems to be all the rage these days(castle in caylus, blue moon city)  Probably some good depth here.  Its amazing how the players early favor decisions change the flavor of the game every time.  If people start finding best starting favors for each seat position I'd be sad.... incredibly impressed but sad.  Play with the advanced setup, each and every time you play.  The beginner's set up.... well you are missing out if you play with it.    I really do like that by picking your favors, its possible to account for seating position.   This could be a 10.  It does what it does very very well.  I have alot of things to try, and thats just always fun.  Plus, it seems that initial paths to victory  must change based on group values, i.e. one must critically think in this game, instead of assigning a value per round cost.  Really awesome. Knowing how to bring your efforts to a hilt for the last two rounds is incredibly crucial.  Three plays in and the player who does this the best wins the game.  The goal is to be efficient in a sea of player chaos.  Much much fun.

Game is a little bit clunky with the way it handles some things, but it is an enjoyable play.

Not a bad game at all, just that none of the mechanics really strike me as unique or stand out on its own. The placement of workers is interesting but at the game end, they become rather limited as the choices dwindle. I enjoy the variety of placements earlier in the game, but the last two-three rounds feel very mechanical and lacking variation since most of the placements no longer makes sense. It then becomes... a "am I lucky enough to have the right resources to invent the right items" situation. Card rearrangement becomes vital in the end. This curtails the variability of the endgame scenarios and in the long run, the replayability of the game.

I got to try Skip's review copy at BoomerCon and there is alot going for this game.  We discussed comparisons with games like Goa, but I think the someone's comparison to Louis XIV works best.  You have limited number of workers, and you need to have a minority in an area on the board in order to take advantage of it's ability for free.  If you don't win, you can pay for the privilege, but money is victory points, so you don't want to overdo that.  Basically you have to pick your fights carefully.

What are you fighting for?  Laboratory time and resources.  You can have two labs so you can be working on two inventions.  Labs can be upgraded, but only when it is idle.  You must dedicate your men to work on inventions, to gather resources, and to other tasks such as the previously mentioned lab upgrades, going to council, and getting more men.  Going to council gives you a grab-bag of options, such as shifting men around, getting money, and getting a look at upcoming invention cards.

There are alot of decisions to be made, such as how to balance using men to do research in the labs verses using them to compete on the main board.  Do you want to upgrade your lab now or can you wait a turn and get it for less of a fight.  There is also an important timing element at the end of the game, since you can't buy any resources on the last two turns.  You have to make sure you plan for the end game.  Well actually, I did fairly well despite totally botching the end, but we were all new to the game.  Experianced players would have murdered me.

RATING: 5.5
A relatively neat worker placement mechanic with a thoroughly mediocre wrapper around it.

Options for placing your workers are really lacking interesting variety.  The bid for building the same invention is fine early, but can be completely deterministic late game.  The pacing wants the game to be longer yet it's already long for what it is.

I remember when this first came out, I took one look at the unappealing box and said "Meh, more euro crap."  I was wrong.  Yeah, the art on both the box and on the inside is pretty weak, but I love the tension of decisions and the amount of apprentice placement conflict.  Being able to place apprentices only once at each location is a nice twist, especially when combined with the Master's ability to circumvent that.  I much prefer to play with open invention declaration, as it can be so crushing if somebody finishes the invention you're working on before you get a chance to do so.  Much prefer the choose your own setup variant rather than going with the predefined ones, which are silly and difficult to set up.  Most of the people who are going to play a game of this type will have at least a slight grasp of what they will want to do in the first play.

Rating after two plays. I think this is a neat game and the comparisons to PoF seem to be a bit accurate. With a previous game under the belt, we hammered out a second game of 3 players in 75 minutes. That time frame in similar to PoF. It is a good game and it certainly warrants more plays to see how everything goes. There were some problems with rules but it was ok.

RATING: 5
Leonardo takes ideas from other games (Princes of Florence and Louis XIV come to mind), and welds them together into a tense, thought provoking game, where the value of investments is astoundingly opaque (a feature I consider to be the game's greatest strength). There is also variability from trying out the different favors during round 0. There is also an aspect of trying to be out of phase with the other players, which is a dynamic I really enjoy in games. Overall a solid game that because of a few rough edges falls just short of being something I actively try to get to the table. Still very happy to own it however. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My first impressions were that this is Pillars of the Earth, with a more reasonable approach to turn order selection.  The actions balance themselves out nicely, and there's an interesting money management game hiding beneath the uber-fiddly setup rules.  I'm interested in playing this one again.  Oddly, the game seems to lack a certain OOMPH that PotE has, and I would probably be more likely to play the latter over the former.

Leonardo da Vinci is a "gamers' game" for 2-5 players by Acchittocca  (a team of Italian game designers). It's a game where you buy resources to create your brilliant inventions in your laboratories. The game revolves around an innovative process where you deploy the same pawns to power your laboratory as to collect the necessary materials, taking turns committing the pawns at the beginning of each round.

Played at Great Hall Games. It is a "worker placement" game like Agricola, but with a few twists and build around the theme of invention.

ok. so i've only played 2 games, and I've muddled the rules a little in both games in terms of how many actions are available and who is eligible in each section. Nevertheless, I really love these types of games where you have to plan well, both in long term and short term. Timing is crucial as the game plays at what feels a cracking pace (although beware of the AP dog that will drag this game into the 2hr realm!!). With the high level of interaction, I really really like this game. This game reminds me of Maharaja in the way that it is one of the few games that I am more than happy to play even as the newness hype of the game has long gone. Unusually though, I think Leonardo has slipped under the radar for many gamers and I believe it deserves much more recognition as a wonderfully compelling game, that is unique in it's own right to certainly consider buying.

RATING: 8
Typical Euro, where you want to do many more things than you can actually do.  Everyone bids for actions using their workers, but workers are also required to create inventions in the lab.  Unlike some Euros, there is almost always a good second and third option should someone block your first option.  And more than one player can share the same action, but only the first player pays no cost.  Very good, but not great.

RATING: 5
Leonardo has resources, stuff-building, worker placement, yet another Renaissance theme, and a moderate degree of player interaction (and cleverness) in the form of bid-hopping.

If you enjoy Caylus and Princes of Florence, you will likely feel the same way about Leonardo.  You will want to buy Leonardo roses and take it dancing.  You will find Leonardo charming and elegant.  And yes, you will admire its shapely curves and scrumptiously wavy hair.

For me, the day that the BGG top 10 is filled with games like Leonardo - you know the type - is the day that my cranky-meter goes to 11.  (I do like Goa, though; I'm such a hypocrite.)

Played twice (with 5 players). I had heard lots of good things about this game and had high expectations, but it turned out to be a bit disappointing - while still a good game. This game definitely has a learning curve, and I cannot say I have played it enough to judge fully. However, so far I rather disliked the lack of control during some phases (mainly the blind bidding to get the invention card), which can lead to huge point swings. I wonder whether it is better with fewer players.

I've found Leonardo to be fairly procedural and repetitive.  The only tension to me was in the guessing of will he or won't he in terms of the inventions your opponents are secretly developing.  I thought the whole hiding your materials under the lab to be rather silly.  While the mechanics of bidding for the city spots should be commended, it is usually fairly obvious and highly tactical.  Unless you absolutely must have a certain something, one should avoid a highly contested area and go for the less desired space(s) for that round.  I felt that there is no "right" way of playing this game.  Whether you upgrade lab, max out apprentices or gather resources first is not the concern.  As long as your don't perform any wasted actions, you will remain in contention.

The research phase was completely anticlimactic, and I absolutely hate the blind bidding for patent right.  Luckily in our session that rarely happened.  I also remain skeptical that there is any benefit granted by having the Leonardo marker.  In fact, I think there is a tremendous advantage in going last.  Also, I found it problematic for someone to stay in competition if he continuously have the bad streak of working on items that were completed earlier.  It is a hole that the game itself does not provide any relief to help you get out of.  As a result, I can't imagine being stuck playing something you have no hopes of turning the situation around.

Oh, if only I could figure out how to play this game!  The instruction are terrible. As far as I can tell, robots in  14th century Italy are way overpowered. Robots seem to be the only winning strategy in the game once you memorize the recipes of the 10 inventions that matter.

From the worker placement family of games along with Pillars of the Earth, Agricola, and Stone Age.

Great theme: you're a da Vincian inventor with a pair of laboratories, and you get points for filling orders for inventions.  Use your workers to collect resources, work on the inventions, recruit more workers, or even build "mechanical men" to work in the labs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There is a lot of goodness in this game.  The theme is exciting, and is carried well in the invention cards.  Building the inventions is a little like a kinder version of Freya's Folly, in that when someone beats you to the punch, you can still finish your work for fewer points.  Upgrading your workshop(s) and adding mechanical men to automate what your apprentices could be doing is a worthwhile thing to do, if well timed.  Acquiring goodies is done through an interesting bidding system which basically requires you to commit all the apprentices of your "bid" at once, except for your master (or vice versa)... unless you get the council action that lets you move an apprentice.  If you don't win the bid, you can still get the goodies for an increasing amount of money.  In fact, you can keep buying more of the things, if you can afford it, and the fee does stop rising after the fourth purchase during a round.

What absolutely wrecks this game is the core mechanism.  Your apprentices are permanent resources that you commit anew each round.  One of the things you can do with them is use them directly to bid for more apprentices.  If you get shut out on this, and can't afford to buy them, you waste your resouces.  The people with more apprentices just keep getting more, while the people still with the minimum can't get any.  The leaders don't have to spend some consumable resource to get more of them, so it's a built-in runaway crush-o-matic mechanism.  Additionally, the people with more apprentices can procrastinate committing the bulk of them to what they want until after the weak players have committed all theirs.  The only "hope" for a player out of money, with the minimum number of apprentices, is to miraculously complete works to get cash, which they can use to buy the apprentice when they're outbid.  See the nice layers of abstraction there?  Why the horrible direct acquisition of workers by having the most workers?  HORRIBLE.

There is so much good game here.  I hate that it is ruined so deftly by its central mechanism.

I guess there are other horrid things, too.  The instructions are dodgy, and the game setup involves ten minutes of bizarre deck manipulation that is different for each quantity of players.  I was ready to forgive those aspects, though, for the elegance of the game, until the crush-o-tron showed itself.  Such a shame.

I'd like to see if playing without C, the apprentice part of the city, and instead giving each player one more apprentice at the end of each round salvages the game.  That would mean that you would start round 2 with 4 of your apprentices, and get your 9th one just in time for the round 8-9 dénouement of sorts.

Interesting and complex game. Lots of ressource management going on. Good about this game is that it has (not like many other games in this genre) a lot of player interaction.

Will update my rating once I have played it with 5 players - might be a problem with the game lasting too long..
Btw: the ressources and board is almost always the same size, regardless of the number of player. I can imagine the game gets more complicated with more players and it's perhaps best to learn the game with a 3- or 4-player game.

The artwork leaves a little bit to be desired, but the gameplay is solid and can be pretty fun. The fact that you are working on a secret invention and that someone else might also be working on it adds tension to the turns, as they could finish before you and steal your thunder (and your points). The planning required for the last two turns can be a little rough, though. Make sure to look ahead enough to plan for that.

Plays very similarly to the other Cryptozoic deck builders.  Pretty simple but nice to have games like this that you can just play while chatting and having a good time.  I don't know this IP as well as some of their others (LOTR, DC) and therefore this rates a little lower.

Overall: Least enjoyed Cerberus Engine base game I've played so far. It has a lot of interesting mechanics that separates it from DC, and LotR, and plenty of welcome additions to the formula however there wasn't enough to support it all together. A lot of Grief effects, and harder to use Character abilities is what ruins the games play experience. 

New Mechanics: This game introduces Positive attack cards, and the Chakra resource. Positive attacks are interesting since they are cheap self benefiting effects, that can be blocked by other players. Chakra resource is an resource you can pay on cards you play for added benefit. Both are fun to play around with, but the synergy of cards, and characters doesn't lead to as many interesting plays as compared to DC which only focuses on one resource.

Main Deck: This set is okay in mixed sets, but requires a lot of modified rules. Most of the base set is experimental compared to other versions of Cerberus. Positive attacks tend to keep all players engaged, while Chakra cards tend not to be easy to trigger. Cards like Poison Fog, Gedo Statue, Itachi, & Zabuza while all interesting  tend to pull the game down with problematic design.

Oversized Character Cards: Something else they experimented with was Chakra points on Character cards. Characters now how to earn their ability by filling Chakra points on the side of their Character cards or playing cards that give Chakra, requiring 3 Chakra to perform their ability. Most of their abilities are far weaker then their DC counterparts, and require more effort to obtain, with only a couple of exceptions.

Cool game at 4 players if everyone likes Naruto. Otherwise ok, unless played at 2 players, then it is great.

Card combos and deckbuilding plus a Naruto theme makes for an okay game. If searching for victory points via Dominion doesn't interest you then the themed deckbuilding games might be a better choice.

Large player counts make deckbuilders drag a little though and now I know why Dominion is set to 4 max (maybe also for balance reasons).

definitely a theme driven game. It has fun game mechanics and is often requested in my household...But mainly because my teenage daughter LOVES Naruto. I think the Marvel deck builder is more fun to play, but I wouldn't write this one off.

Son is fan of Naruto so get to the table. 2 different currencies makes this little different from others in series.

Possibly the most mechanically interesting of the Cryptozoic deck builders that I've played so far. The only reason I don't rate it higher is my complete disinterest in the Naruto IP.

This is a decent game. The experience is multiplied if you watched the Naruto anime. I enjoyed this game, but started to notice a lot of downtime playing with new players which lowered my rating of the game recently.

While being pretty similar to all of the other Cerberus engine deck building games a few additional rules make this one a lot of fun. If you aren't a fan of any of the others this one wont convert you, but if you're a fan of the anime it captures the feel quite well.

Great deck builder, combining the best elements from other deck building games and also adding new mechanics into the mix too.

I have next to no interest in Naruto, but this game is another solid offering from the Cryptozoic line of deck builders. The one that sets this one apart is the Chakra Mechanism. While it is a little confusing to implement, it leads to some pretty awesome combos. I'm also a big fan of the cards in this set that do things when you buy them instead of just when you play them. This adds an interesting layer to the game, and I wish it would be implemented in DC more. So while the theme doesn't do anything for me at all, the game play of this one is on the level of the other Cerberus Engine games.

I really enjoyed this game much more than the DC deck builder. It had the same basic mechanics but the games cards feel more balanced and the it seems more strategic because of the added chakra mechanic.

Enjoyable Naruto re-skin for Cryptozoic's Cerberus engine. The Chakra system works well, though makes combining with other Cerberus games difficult. Biggest down side is that you'll really need to be a fan of the anime to really appreciate the game. Like other Cerberus games, if you don't care for the IP the game's based on, it's not particularly remarkable.

My first experience with a game that is just deck-building, nothing more. It's easy, and apparently it's better than Dominion, because this one has more interaction... Móre interaction? Then Dominion's definitely not my game. 

This kind of game is an ok filler, but not one I need in my collection

07-07-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Naruto is a game based on the DC-Deckbuilder engine, the Cerberus engine. It's a quite typical deckbuilder.

You start out with a bad deck, and buy cards out of an ever changing central offer of 5 cards. At the end of the turn, the central offer is refilled. You buy cards by spending power. You aim to kick the ass of the bosses, archenemies from the Naruto world. 

The game extends the DC-Deckbuilder implementation by involving Chakra. Every character in Naruto has a character card with 4 chakra-points, that each correspond to a type of cards. If you play a card, you fill on of the slots and generate chakra. If you have 3, you can activate the special ability on the character card. Cards in the market often generate or use chakra to boost.

I like it. I like it as an improvement over Ascension, which I feel is ugly and a bit overwrought with the two currencies. Otherwise, I like it a lot. Good game, unfortunately I crush my GF to easily and she doesn't like the game anymore because of it. Naruto theme doesn't really do much for me.. but it doesn't detract either.

Includes the Minato first edition promo.

A fairly easy to learn Deck-building game.  Overall I've had 2 complete playthroughs and I can't say I've really been disappointed.  To start, I am a fan of the Naruto series but many of my fellow players are not, however because of simplistic design of cards without over exaggerating them or adding too much complex concepts that players who are not familiar with the show won't understand. 

I do have a few issues with the game that anyone should consider before picking it up or sitting down to play.  First and foremost was a time issue.  My fellow players and I were not completely strapped for time when we sat down to play, being three of us, however by the time we understood fully how everything works we had spent nearly 3 hours to complete the game, not including the time spent tallying up the points.

My second issue being the power structure of the cards.  While the "Paths of Pain" have their VP values that are based off of how many you have, they do have the option to destroy them for some really neat effects.  However certain cards resulted in a drastic shift of VP values in the end.  Specifically the Asuma and Jiraya cards had VP values based off how how many of a certain card type in your deck, and doing things like purchasing both of them can really offset the scores in the end.

All in all it's an excellent deck builder game that is far easier to learn than it first looks like.  My suggestion is to set enough time aside to finish as session and note that you will need time to read through the rules probably multiple times as well as count points and reorganize the cards at the very end.  Definitely a good pick.

Przyjemna gra, na plus bardzo szybki setup (niecała minutka i można grać) oraz dość ciekawa mechanika punktów czakry. Poza tym jest dość losowa, nie wszystkie karty wydają się zbalansowane i ich dość wczesne zdobycie może zapewnić znaczną przewagę. Dodatkowo praktycznie każda karta punktuje, więc nie ma za bardzo mowy o optymalizowaniu decku przez jego skracanie, rozrasta się on dosyć szybko. Zdolności postaci też nie wydają się odpowiednio wyważone, ale nie jest jakoś specjalnie źle pod tym względem.

My wife and I love how this plays with 2 players. We both enjoy the Anime theme & the combos that arise during game play. I enjoyed myself even when I strongly suspected I was losing!

As far as deck builders go, this one is pretty fun.  I don't know a lot about the theme though (I got it for my son).  I probably will look into the other games with the same engine whose characters I recognize better.  I don't really care about theme, so the fact that recruiting allies to fight allies and enemies to fight enemies is irrelevant to me.

Not sure why I like this game as much as I do. Star Realms delivers a similar experience, but is more streamlined, faster to play and set up, and certainly more accessible. I think my son and I enjoy this game mainly because we watched the anime together. If you recognize all the characters and events on the cards it will certainly make this game a more enjoyable experience. If you don't, you are left with a solid, but somewhat generic deck-builder with a few original twists. It just takes a little too long to play to see more table time than it currently does at my house.

Played once or twice with a friend who owns it. It's really fun, on top of me already collecting the Cerberus engine.

Cryptozoic deck building engine used here, too. I didn't like the positive attacks. Rather allow clever play in some other way than give overpowered cards that other players have to defend against.

Fun game, but not as fun as I hoped given the theme.  Really it is just a solid euro set-collecting optimisation game.  But a very clever one.

Unfortunately it has a couple of excellent newbie-traps in making sure you have the actions/resources left to buy a "big stadium" event in the last turn AND have a big stadium. I fell into that trap, which is pretty gutting.

Disappoined with this because the game has some good ideas and, unusually for a german game, lots of chrome. However, we played without the variant rule that allows you to purchase more than one set of assets each turn and I think this would enhance the game considerably

Due to the limited number of tiles you can gain during the game, I feel like you are more or less scripted based on what you start with and what your first shows are.  I find that I don't enjoy games with a trading phase, as it just takes a long time and rarely seems to accomplish anything.

RATING: 7
Great theme, great components, fun, has randomness (yuck), but fortunately some of this can be mitigated, and definitely has some strategy.

Yes, it has some similarities to Princes of Florence, but I own and enjoy both.  I think this is definitely a game with a much wider audience.  There are only 5 rounds, but the game does take some time to play (more than the 60-90 minutes listed), as there are several phases each round: investment (limited action purchasing of items), auctioning, trading, putting on shows, and cleanup each round.

The way the game is scored is one of its best features: you only score for your "best" performance, which will probably be your last in the game, which results in revealing the winner only at the very end.

I don't know what to think of this title... it FEELS like a classic Kramer title, but then again, it doesn't. Hard to pin down. I liked the game, but there's something nagging me about it that will eventually either come to the fore, or will be dismissed as a personal issue with my play style. It happens.

first play with 5 players took 2.25 hours after 20 minutes of rules. the others really enjoyed it, i thought it went too long.  we used the Intense Auction varient, which i think is a good way to go.  but having the auction round and then the trading round was a little painful. 
i'd play this again either with fast gamers, or just a 3 player game.

This is one of the few games I actually won at the '07 Oasis of Fun. I also managed to win a copy on the prize table! So you can see why I'm off to a good start with this one. I think this is definitely the most gamer oriented game that DoW have put out. I also see the comparisons with Princes of Florence. However, I think the game stands up well by itself. It is a beautiful game, with a lot of fun planning and some tense moments. The "Intense Auctions" variant is a must, and the trading phase must be done quickly. With those two caveats in place, I would never turn down a game. One of the top 2007 games! UPDATE: I think that three player is the way to go here... the extra players don't add much except time. I think Prices of Florence should be played with four or five. Leave Colosseum for the three player games.

RATING: 7
A beautiful production, which feels like a re-theme of Kramer's older classic, Princes of Florence. Colosseum is simpler, with more interaction, and feels less of a heavyweight title. But it's a great game in its own right. Ultimately, the key mechanic is set-collecting. This is done through auction and trading phases, in order to score victory points. The key innovation here is the scoring system which makes perfect sense. Ultimately, regardless of how well a player has played in the early rounds, only the more effective player in the final round will win. This depends on everything they've put in place previously in the game, so doesn't feel unfair, but it can produce a surprise turn-around in fortunes. Excellent stuff.

This was a bit deeper than I thought it would be.  Days of Wonder have certainly done it again, though this game tends towards the medium level of euros rather than the light.  Yet, as with all DoW games, the presentation is such fun that it feels light, anyway.

The key seems to be to plan ahead.  You need to think 2 or 3 events ahead rather than just one.  You might not need Chariots now, but do your chit strengths mean that you are likely to later?  And, for instance, priests are needed for all of the 5 most prestigious events, so if you get one, it's probably not a good idea to trade it early.  You might want to keep it, but if you do trade it in, it'll be worth more later for sure.

The roll and move for the 6 bigwigs is a bit more thoughtful than just any old roll and move and you have to decide whether it's worth playing an Emperor medal to affect it.  Personally, I think buying an Emperor's Loge early on is pretty critical.

Although there are elements of PoF in the assembly of your events, Hollywood Blockbuster in the bidding, the game I really felt I was closest to whilst in play was Civilisation during the bidding phase..."I'll give you 3 salt for that gold - no, make that two gladiators for that chariot."   The trading is really very key in this fun game.  You can certainly lose the game right there.

So - critical trading, thoughtful roll and move, bidding, strategy (in what you buy and what events you pre-plan for), theme, luck, an interesting set of multi-ability jokers...all good stuff.  What more could you want from a mediumish Euro?

A neat game. It can be frustrating to have no idea who is "winning" throughout the game though. The winner is made in the last round. It seems being first place in early rounds is often detrimental as losing your best tile is not offset by getting the +3 spectators to your arena. It is a strange design when a games strategic depth is in avoiding being the best.

+ Awesome theme and amazing components make you buy into the theme more than is probably justified.
- If people come into the game expecting bloody gladiator-style combat, they are usually disappointed through no fault of the game itself.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game is not gone for any problems that I had with it.  As a matter of fact, I love the components, the theme, and the gameplay thoroughly.  
I gave this game away as a Christmas present to a friend as it turned out to be his favorite game that we played.  I also owned Prince of Florence at the time, which has a lot of similarities (albeit minus the awesome theme).

Well, I played it.

Did not enjoy much, and would not want to play again.  I didn't enjoy that some types of performers were dead ends, while others were used for more performances and for higher-point performances.

Do you fight for the best (all or nothing), or settle for a lesser performance (decent but not great) and give up your chance to win?  I didn't enjoy the existence of that decision in the game of Life, and I didn't enjoy it here.

Fun game, felt maybe a bit long, and the auctions were neat but not that exciting (you really have to specialize). It does a very admirable job of combining resource management, auctions, and set collection -- it's very much a hybrid game. I'd like to play again to get a better feel for the strategy (I did well but didn't plan well enough for the long term -- I probably would have placed worse if not some really good luck). I really liked the way it looked though and had fun playing. Since this doesn't work with two players though, it won't make my wishlist.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this resoruce gathering game. The translation of resources into points scoring worked well and I enjoyed the theme. The components are up to high DoW statndards, while the only doubt seems to be over the game length as the prelude to the final (possibly decisive) position is the 4 preceding rounds. I'm looking forward to playing this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A semi-interesting game with auctions, trading and resource control, plus a smidgen of dice-rolling.

The limited availability of events, and the limited number of actions, means there's more player interaction (some of it subtle) beyond the auctions and negotiations (trading).

The theme and connection thereto pushes this from a 5 to a 6 for me.

A well-enough done game, but I'd much rather play Princes of Florence.  The two are [i]very[/i] similar in many ways, including the auctions, the limited actions and the completion of events/works (of limited availability) to earn income.  Theme is much more apparent and better implemented in Colosseum and there's more player interaction, but Princes feels smoother with more interesting choices that enable more strategy and may play faster since there are no negotiations to resolve.

I would play Colosseum occasionally, but I would be willing to play Princes much more often.

1st play: One of the better open trading style games I've played.  The players bring the balance here, and the auctions are a little less exciting than they could be. Most went for minimum bid or close to it and it had a bit of the strong get stronger vibe, but I think that could be overcome with experience. I look forward to a second play. 

No 2nd play: 2 months have gone by and this one hasn't come up again.  It was decent but not amazing.

Build a show for your stadium and ensure by the end of the game you have performed the most spectacular show(most points) to win. You have to build your stadium, buy the show, get the performers and the stage and then persuade the great and good of Rome to come and see it. Fun game with lots of room for awful puns and gentle ribbing of opponents who repeat shows. Recommend.

Interesting game marred by two cloying features: I hate the theme. I would have preferred a Broadway theme over the Bread and Circuses motif. Also, the rules use the feminine personal pronoun throughout rather than going gender neutral. Another problem is the trading phase: everybody needs the same things so there is no real reason to barter. The list of requirements to put on a show needs considerable readjusting.

RATING: 4
This game's problems start with the victory condition which makes only what the players score on the last turn matter.  The previous four turns are just preparation for that final scoring.  A strategy that I and others have won with is to deliberately score the least in the first four turns to gain my choice of tile from the "leader" at the end of the turn.  That advantage (three tiles in my last game) may seem small, but in a game where so much else is balanced, it can be critical.  An effective strategy this may be, but fun it's not. Layer on top of that a build phase that is formulaic because there are just five turns and four, maybe five things that must be built to stay in contention.  Plus an auction system that barely functions and trading that is plain dull.  And none of this is helped by money being both plentiful and of no value in the final scoring.  Finish with a slice of luck in the form of the wandering Caesar and his consuls; just pray that more than one is in range of your colosseum come the final turn.  And despite the low number of turns it takes a long time to play. 
Rarely have so many elements that don't quite work been cobbled together in one game.  The remarkable thing is that it doesn't fall apart entirely.

This game feels like it would have been very cool ten years ago, but playing it today (in 2017), you can feel how it's been left behind by history.

A game with nice theme and elegant components, as often in Days of Wonder games. An amusing game, with good mix of long-term planning, instant reacting, and trading. Also some interaction and randomness. Not as serious as somewhat similar Princes of Florence, but nice to play.
Edit: The rules could use some fixing.. now it's often good not to be first player, because the penalty of one asset token is quite hard, especially if taken many times. I should try with the variant.

A great game for people looking for something beyond Catan.  Plays up 5, plays best with 5, but is still enjoyable with 3 or 4.  Games typically last around 90 minutes (although the first game may take considerably longer).  The components included are all fantastic and abundant, almost overflowing the tight-fitting box.  The rules might be a bit of a read, but the game makes sense and is easy to get into due to the cyclical nature of each round (you invest in your arena, you bid for assett tokens, trade, run your event, then prepare for the next round and repeat).  The only thing that new players may have difficulty with is  planning ahead for future events.  Nevertheless a perfect "next-step" game and a lot of fun all around.

Really nice looking game. The theme and mechanics blend together nicely and evokes a good atmosphere to the game. Very enjoyable and often has close scores.
The intense auction variant is a must, money becomes a bit tighter and you can acquire more tiles which leads to more options. It also improves the three player game no-end.
In can be a very long game if people start trading a lot and pondering about the auctions. It does pick up toward the end.

This is a game that requires knowledge of how it plays in order to play well.  Luck of the tile draws and initial 'scripts' is a factor.  The luck of dice rolls for moving the emperor, consuls, and senators is also a factor but not significant.  The emperor's favors are a factor.  It may be possible to run an excellent 3 show and beat a 4 show, but it is unlikely.  Many people might be expecting (or wanting) a deeper game, but I think this fits in very well with the depth and style of most Days of Wonder games.  It is a descent game to add to a library but not a must have.

I have played one game of this so far, with people I'd only just met and the rules explanation was short. It was still good though and I'll play again if I get the chance. I'll have to decide if auction games are my thing or not though, this is the first I've played.
5 Mar 2008 - Three games now, most of my opponents have played before and I think I've got things mostly sorted. It's not so much an auction game as I thought, although there is definitely a large auction element. I also discovered it's really important to have redundancy plans; twice in the one game I had someone take the show I wanted in the round I was going to buy it.

This rating could go up if we played more. I really enjoy Colosseum but the trading phase can be awkward. Definitely would no suggest the auction rules that are included with the game. Overall accessible to a lot of people which makes this a good game to have around and it has mechanics which aren't available in other gateway games.

Money is way too easy to come by in this game.  If the auctions ever got competetive, that would suck out some of the extra cash, but rarely do players compete for the same set of resources.  Other than that, I love the game, although I am starting to see formulas for victory emerge in our group.  If Colosseum turns out to have only one path to victory (Emperor's Doge followed by excessive medal collection to get both a highest level show as well as a new show each round), then it will spell doom for this title for me.

Szépnek szép, különleges is, ezért nem sajnálom az egyébként meglepően elnyúló játékidőt (tisztán 2 és fél óra volt, 5 fővel, a cserélgetésekkel elég sokat elszüttyögtünk). Ami nekem meglepő volt, hogy nem nagyon adta vissza az aréna hangulatát, pedig a díszletek adva voltak hozzá. A szenátorok körben mászkálása számomra kicsit erőltetett, és nem mellesleg elég nagy szerencsefaktort is visz a játékba. A lapkák meg még ennél is többet. Ezzel együtt azt mondom, elég sok féle nyerési út kínálkozik, a mi játékunk tanulsága számomra a következő: a győzelemhez nem muszáj megépíteni a legnagyobb arénák egyikét (20-as ünnep lett végül a nyertes 91 ponttal), és a 2 dobókockás épület nem ér meg egy akciót szerintem. A játék végén a pénzből elég nagy bőség volt, ez meglepett. Ja, amit majdnem kifelejtettem: a pontozás nagy ötlet szerintem, a seelandban is visszaköszön hasonló. Hogy sportos hasonlattal éljek: nem az összpontszám számít, mint pl. a legtöbb labdajátékban, hanem a legjobb eredmény, mint az atlétikai számok nagy részénél (ugrások, dobások). Kézenfekvő, de valamiért nem divat a játékoknál ez a fajta értékelés.
Összességében szép játék, és a helyén kezelve szerintem jónak is mondható. Máskor is játszanék vele szívesen.

As it is Days of Wonder, it is certainly impressive.  The board looks beautiful and tokens and figures add a great touch.  Nice photograp.  The game itself is quite similar to Princes of Florence, but of course with differences.  I do not like the trading phase (in general in games) because I think it favours king-making.
For sure there are a lot of different strategies to follow, although the objective is clear: make your last show as big as possible, since only the greatest of them will be accounted.  
Very nice game, really entertaining, with simple rules (although there are quite a lot of them).

Colosseum is a little more random than say Princes of Florence.  Keep in mind that I dislike trading games that feature the random distribution of resources.

[i]Posted: 2/10/09, Rated: 7[/i]
{3P: ???, 4P: 7, 5P: ???}

Ratings are subjective, pure and simple.  Thus, let me tell you about my preconceptions regarding [i]Colosseum[/i]: I suspected that it was a bad game.

Days of Wonder offered a copy [i]for free[/i] in December of '08 if you spent $50 or more on their site.  One copy of [i][thing=21348]Ticket to Ride: Märklin Edition[/thing][/i] later, and I owned both titles.  What kind of game do you give away for free?  "One that isn't selling well on its own," was my reply and also the reason I suspected the game was bad.

Was I ever wrong.

[i]Colosseum[/i] is a good game.  It might even be great, but we'll get to that in a moment.  First, let's talk about the absolutely ridiculous production values.  Days of Wonder is known for their lavish offerings, but they've really outdone themselves this time.  The sculpted noble meeples are exquisite.  The artwork is detailed, pleasing, and is highly saturated in color.  The theme has been consistently applied in every aspect of the game.  I love how [i]Colosseum[/i] looks on the table.

It must be the game play which comes up short, then, right?  Wrong again.  If anything, [i]Colosseum[/i] is too deep for its own good.  There's an investment phase, with seemingly equal choices which in reality are not; an auction phase, which is going to paralyze new players who don't yet have a handle on valuing tiles; and then a trading phase which is also difficult for new players to quantify.

A good starting place is to compare the relative benefit of the items in question to the receiving players.  At this point, the game feels calculation-heavy, like the worst parts of [i][thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing][/i].  If you believe that [i][thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing][/i] has no "worst parts," then go out and secure a copy of [i]Colosseum[/i] immediately.  All of these auctions and trades should be pursued with a long-term strategy in mind: producing a show whose components you are trying to acquire throughout the game.  Try to select your end-goal at the very beginning, and hope the show you want to produce is still available when you're ready to purchase it.  If you're counting, there are at least three mechanisms in play which are going to require a deeper understanding before the game starts to "click."

Scores for the round are tallied using that same calculation, everyone suffers some attrition, and then there is a charity step where the poorest gets to steal from the richest.  Wash, rinse, and repeat for five rounds.  The trick is not to set too high of a score early on: the charity step serves as an inducement to choose your shot wisely -- a fourth mechanic which requires several plays to appreciate.

[i]Colosseum[/i] looks great, hides surprising depth, and is an exciting title for veteran players.  Why doesn't it earn a higher score then?  Perhaps those preconceptions are still seeping through.  Or maybe it's because competition at the higher ranking levels is very fierce.  One thing is for sure: I'm looking forward to playing it again.  Only time will tell if it has true greatness, or if it is merely a crumbling façade.

Light enough to teach non-gamers, deep enough to keep most gamers entertained. Beautiful bits, good mechanics and tight game play makes this one tense. You need to have a plan and stick to it. Have a large colosseum show in mind from the start and begin to collect the pieces. This one has many different mechanisms to keep it interesting. You need to manage your money, make purchases, barter with opponents, influence the nobles and put on a show. This one has something for everyone.

Wow!! This game is wonderful! I love the auction mechanic. The tactics of trying to set up a production each turn is just so much fun. And it's everything you would expect from a DOW game. Fantastic components, a well written, easy to understand rulebook, player aids, and a board (although most of it is completely useless) that is beautiful to look at. If I play this again and win again, I will probably rate this up to a 10. Buy this!!!!!

Auctions, followed by trading, all in an effort to build sets makes for a tedious game.  But wait...there's more.  Throw in the good ol' 'roll and move' mechanic and you've got the makings of a real stinker.  The game forces players to know the 30 or so 'show' designs in order to be successful - which means constantly referring to the player aid chart.  A very slow game only made even more special with a dash of analysis paralysis, too!  What more could anybody want?!?  Well, Colosseum also provides an abusive catch-up mechanic and a scoring system where after 2-3 hours of play only the last turn matters!  Now, that's entertainment!

I am a big Wolfgang fan, and this game is very fun every time I play it.  This game has a bit of everything as far as mechanics go, and I feel that game flows very very well.  Most of all, I enjoy the feel of the game.  It is enjoyable to collect tiles, produce events, and reap the rewards.  The game has a relaxed feel, but it is also highly competitive and can be quite cutthroat.  I love that both feelings can exist within this one great game.  The luck is very low, but present, which I really enjoy;   rolling the dice to move the spectators is fun, and it is nice to have the capability to influence dice rolls through purchased peices to add to you colloseum if desired.  I really love this colorful, fun game.

Another very atractive game by DoW. Unfortunately not the best one they made. There were some choices made in the rules that I really do not like. Esspecially the fact that scoring is not cumulative can make for a rather unsatisfactory game in my opinion. Still there's nothing that some variant or house rules couldn't fix.

Will never be one of the great games but is certainly one of those hovering around the margins of greatness. I return to this one every once in a while and it always repays me.

The jockeying for position is reminiscent of Power Grid - nobody wants to come first, you want to come a close second or a close last and the investment decision at the start of each round is a tough one (5 rounds, one buy per round, many things to buy). Highly enjoyable, though ultimately marked down a little because it is smashing with 5, but only good with 4 and not so good with 3.

What a wonky game.  I really liked the show / scoring mechanism in the game, however wasn't a huge fan of the auction / free from negotiation.

Colosseum comes with the cutest little meeples I've ever seen. It's also one of Days of Wonder's best games. The rulebook is a bit longer than your average DoW offering, but it's a very easy game to learn and to teach. 
You'll want to do so much in this game, but there's just no time do accomplish it all, which means that there are some pretty brutal decisions to be made. In spite of this, the game moves briskly and does a good job of keeping every player involved at almost all times.
The unique theme is pulled off beautifully.

Played this at Origins.  meh.  The game's ok.  I like the dynamics of putting on the event, however, it seems whomever puts on the biggest event wins.  You're locked into your decision, if you can't put on a full budget event or if you're little budget event is all you have, you can only hope the other players, screw it up.  Several times I felt helpless and could only hope to catch a break on the next round.

Another good entry from DoW.  I have my suspicions that there really isn't enough here to keep it interesting over the long haul, but for the moment it's a good family game to add to the mix.

Edit - after many more plays, it's still fairly interesting.  This isn't a game I immediately want to  play again, but it's light and fun and is great for the occasional family get-together.  I wouldn't mind if it felt a little more like Gladiator and a little less like American Idol.

There only 5 rounds so you need to study the tile & show combinations that work well together or else you will end up going in multiple directions and not score enough points.  There are too many types of asset tiles and not enough of each (alternatively, you could say there aren't enough wild tiles), especially considering the rapid loss of tiles via retirement.  Annoying that there is not a superstar for each asset type, especially because almost everything has the same rarity (10-12 tiles in the bag).  With 3p you don't see enough tiles (partially due to the fact that there are so many stinking kinds of asset tiles) & there is little trading.  With any number of players, you really need to pay attention to who is getting a slam dunk and progressing from one show to the next perfectly... then the losers must gang up on the winner(s) and take the most important tiles during the "steal" phase.  

Completing shows in step-wise fashion is critical because each completed show provides a +5 bonus to your next show.  I would like to try adding a 6th round for the 3-player game.  The noble movement trend is 2 laps around the board for the 5p game and only 1 lap for the 3p game (probably due to fewer dice rolls in the 3p).

UPDATE.  Haven't played in a long time but my residual gut feelings are as follows... it's an okay auction game but nothing stellar, someone pays a bunch and gets what they want, everyone else just kind of does the best they can with sloppy seconds.  It plays better than that sounds and there were some ways to mitigate the luck and limited choices, but (in my opinion) it is maybe just a little above average as far as auction games go.

The boardgaming worlds tribute to Olly Reed in Gladiator. Another game I have played just once and would like to play again, I really enjoyed the mechanism of this and it was not exactly clear who would win until the last round, which is always nice! Buy a bigger production, collect the things you need to be in it and away you go...

With the full list of shows available it tends to make those decisions very hard to make for AP prone players... but I like the single best show VP idea and I like how you have to plan your shows out several rounds ahead.  I don't love the movement of the little dudes that provide bonuses, but I think it is a great game element and helps to provide options.  Great components of course.

One play so far. Looks really nice and the whole building a stadium and moving officials around works really well. The auctions feel like they should be more competitive (usually one player just paid the base cost) but the highest scoring event means everyone's in with a chance in the last round. Look forward to playing again.

Played this at least 12 times over the years and it keeps on being interesting while not overly complicated. Basically it's set collection and bidding, a combination I'm used to thanks to many games of Knizia, but it adds the right amount of spice (as Catan-like trading) to make an engaging game. Also it's not about gathering increasing amounts of money, but gearing up to make a peak performance.  I do suspect a bit of a balance issue for the player that ends up scoring the highest multiple times in a row. You get rewarded for this in increased scoring, but the penalty of having your actors and props being stolen by the lowest scoring player can seriously hamper you for final round scoring. Also, it seems hard to win without an Emperor's Lodge in round one. The extra die is too good to ignore.

As an added bonus, the game looks great with nice artwork and wooden pieces painted in multiple colors. At least, the Days of Wonder version, they botched the reprint as far as I'm concerned.

Almost perfect game.  Although it usually ends up taking two hours a play, it does not seem to drag on.  The nobles going around the track provide just enough randomness that eliminates the ability of one player to always dominate with a given strategy.  The deals made during each trading phase gives the game a fun group atmosphere.

Quite a few plays in, I still enjoy the game.  However, it needs more options for events.  Lions, cages, boats - all are generally dead ends that will not win the game.  

Intense auctions variant is much more interesting except the events then have too few requirements.  Adding extra requirements to the late events seems to be a way to possibly fix this.

Set collection, auction drafting, and infrastructure building set in ancient Rome. Players gather "assets" (lions, horses, gladiators, comedians, musicians, scenery, etc. etc) in order to stage productions in their individual colisseums. Productions and venues start off small but opportunities to enlarge your venue (small, medium and large) and mount ever more spectacular productions are part of the game. Of course, larger productions require more room and more assets and cost more to "get the rights." 

The game lasts five turns - the end of each turn is where you stage your production and collect the prestige (VP) it merits along with an equivalent amount of money. At the start of each turn you have one opportunity to make a capital investment which could be enlarging the venue, buying the rights to another production, adding a loge, or the provision of season ticket holders which add to the prestige of the production each turn. As there are normally only five such opportunities, a lot of thought needs to go into which investment you make and in what order you make them.

The acquisition of assets is done via auction in lots of three. Each turn, a player will acquire a set of three assets (you start the game with six random assets). The lots are "open" so you can see what you are bidding on. After the auctions are concluded, there is a Settlers style trading phase where players can trade assets between them. Before staging (and scoring) your production, you roll one (or two) dice to move pawns around the board from venue to venue. The pawns represent influential persons you wish to attract to your venue (Emperor, Tribunes and Senators). The presence of these personages add more to your prestige.

The game is beautifully produced - I'm constantly impressed by the quality board game production is exhibiting these days! Gameplay is brisk and a five player game only takes about two hours to play. Although the initial draw of assets and productions is random but very important, the fun factor is decent - I would play it again.

It's 'ok' - lovely bits as you'd expect from Days of Wonder, but lovely bits a great game doesn't make ...

It's a mish-mash of stuff you've seen before, and all about investing and timing along with auctions and random chit pull. And an element of sitting in 2nd place and sprinting past at the end like powergrid.

I'd play it again, as there is an element of long-term planning and there are various routes to victory making it interesting. Luck can overwhelm though, chit replacement means you can press your luck and wait to see if something better appears and then get it cheap, pull it off and you do well, if the right chits don't appear ...

So, all seems good, why the '5'? I don't much like the dudes moving around the track, their bonus is really rather important, and if you get them early then it's an income boost, but later is more vital as really you're going to score your best show in the last round. Which makes the frst rounds all rather pointless, you're just building your tile set and income and stadium for the last big bash.

Ends up being a game I'd play if someone else was keen, but not likely to suggest it and no desire to own a copy.

Play w/5. It has some things I am not fond of, including a king-maker aspect and horrendous amounts of down-time. Since this is a new game and those two things are pretty much a kiss of death for me, I am not impressed by this effort. The only thing that kind of saves it and therefore might motivate me to play it again is that it is a resource development game at its base level. I dont even really care for the theme! Wait!

This is a solid Days of Wonder release.  Heavier than I thought.  The art is colorful, and the game is very thematic.  I don't know how deep it is yet, I get the impression your goal is to plan your endgame at the halfway point, and make sure you are not going for the same goal as any other person at the table.  Too much overlap and someone is going to get crushed.

EDIT: Lowered it a bit because I don't like the trading aspect of the game.  It's too important, and seems like a patchwork fix.

Colosseum is the type of game you expect from Days of Wonder: an average middle weight euro with some positives that make it stand out: beatiful components and an unusual theme. What little interaction there is is provided by the auction, the movement of consuls and emperor, and the different shows. Planning which show you want to perform is the key to winning the game. A typical '6' in my book: enjoyable in the right circumstances.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love it. It's probably my favorite game centered around an auction. There is so much fun to have in the game's flexibility, and the uniqueness and utter playfulness of it's design. I never see players experience AP playing this euro because the game feels so intuitive. There isn't the counting and agony over decisions that Power Grid has, and while it's fairly tight the game allows you to keep fitting more and more into your turns, which is so rewarding. Got to be one of the funnest euros, though if you don't like randomness or trading that might be a deal breaker. Try it with the fan-made 6 player expansion, as it may even be better with 6 than with 4 or 5. A great game experience, just remember to have fun and describe the shows you're putting on (especially if you were missing pieces and you have to try and describe the entertainment value of watching a single gladiator and a plant pot). Not as honed or precise as Power Grid, but definitely funnier, a bit more raucus and, dare I say it, perhaps more fun.

EDIT: One thing I should note, we always play with "free" trading, where everyone just trades with whoever. I also recommend that, with fewer than five players, you play with the intense auction variant as it adds needed tension to the bids. Indeed, this is a game where you may need to try a few rule variants to see what works best for your group. Some may be irritated by that, but I find it a very flexible game.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game. But there are a few fundamental problems. There is a king making element during the 5th round of the game. With so much open information, the winner is easily calculated before the shows are staged. This allowed the winner to be decided by others. 

The game is also very long. Both times we played, with teaching, it took 3.5 hours. Our group dynamics has a lot of negotiation which stretched out the game. In the end, the game wasn't worth the time commitment.

On the plus side, the game is gorgeously produced by Days of Wonder. The oversized board, loads of high quality cardboard components and resin figures are all outstanding.

Easy to learn, delightful to play, and the fact that only your best score counts makes for some interesting decision making. The catch-up mechanism can be tantalizingly difficult to work. I had a game where I PLANNED to spend at least the first round or two in last, but somehow wound up LEADING every round -- except of course the last, where I was soundly trounced. Still tons of fun.

Great game. Light, yet fraught with tough decisions. Cute, but very competitive. This is a family game with teeth. 

You might think this is just another simple set-collection game. You would be wrong. The auctions make it critical that you make more money every turn, especially if you want to stay competitive, but you need at least two turns to put on a larger event: one to expand your stadium and another to buy the bigger show. This means you are always planning in advance, sometimes three or four turns in advance, gathering performers you will want at endgame. But since everyone else is doing the same, you really need to keep an eye on what they are doing lest two of you go for the same show. The end result is a pretty thought-provoking, medium-weight Euro that feels really light and simple. A perfect combination.

Preliminary rating after one play.  Definitely a learning curve to this game.  I like that there appears to be several different paths to scoring well.  A concern is that luck seems to play a very high role in the game: initial resource & event draws, draws for what appears in the marketplace, rolls for the nobles, etc.  Not sure there is enough control to make any kind of strategy pay out, but it is hard to make that call after only one play.

Sigh. This is reasonably fun, but the hopelessly broken Emperor's Loge is a bit of a red flag. That this is so mis-costed it isn't funny - it could be at least triple the cost and probably still be underpriced. Maybe quadruple. The best answer might be to give everyone one for free at game start, but then one hates to muck with the total number of build phases received, it might screw things up. Regardless, anyone who doesn't buy one on turn one will not win. I absolutely guarentee it.

Other than that, this is a kinda fun game - I like the bidding followed by a dealing phase, sort of like Die Haendler. But things somehow don't feel right here. Lots rarely get bid up (even with the "advanced" rules) because the floor price is rather high, and then there isn't a whole lot of dealing, because of the way the items are used (there are a number that are useful for almost anything, then others that are used in tandem, and with only 3 up for bid in any given lot its unusual to bid for a lot with much in it that you don't want).

The theme is nice, but I think this is an example of a game whose theme is sapped by sub-standard gameplay. If the bidding or trading phases were more lively, with more competition and more opportunities for deal-making, and if people were forced to deal more to get what they wanted, I think the theme would work a lot better. But the balances all seem off, and the so the tension isn't what it should be, so the game lurches where it should glide.

I can't quite put my finger on why this game gives me fits.  Or even if it IS giving me fits.  It's strange.  I think I've figured out that the goal of the game is to save up all your goodness for that one final show...but how to make that happen still eludes me.  It's a fun game - but I'm not sure all of the pieces of it fit together as tightly as they're supposed to.

UPDATE: Every time I play this, it goes down in my book.  My group loves it, but I think that many of the mechanics are wonky, a lot of the elements are imbalanced and all of the decisions are made for you.  I deplore that the last place player is entitled to take from the first place player because, during the first four shows, last place and first place have no meaning.  As a catch-up mechanic, it's horrible because there's no catching up to do!  Maybe the point is that you're supposed to come in last in the first four shows, but I really think that's a poor design.

I usually like games like this where you're slowly building up throughout the game, and this was no exception.  However, I'm not sure there's enough here to keep me coming back.

RATING: 5
[05/04/2007] This appears to be one of those games (Zug um Zug would be another good example) in which you're executing a once formulated game plan as the game encourages players to specialize and carve out their own niche in the world of Roman showbiz. 

The winner is bound to be the one who formulated the best game plan and managed to implement without it being derailed. This may make the way future turns and the endgame shape up quite predictable and therefore prove somewhat anti-climactic.

AUCTION PHASE:

Most auctions tend to be pretty dull affairs due to the degree of specialisation going on here. The special chits do occasionally jazz up an auction, but the auctions don't add anywhere as much excitement and fun to the game as in the thematically quite similar Traumfabrik. 

Really, specialisation leading to relatively lacklustre auctions is exactly the same problem which dogs Phalanx Games' Emira (though to a yet greater extent). A game which is equally puts great emphasis on formulating a game plan and pulling it through.

TRADE PHASE:

Am I the only one finding straightforward trading getting rather stale and potentially tedious? Yet leaving this personal gripe aside, I feel the trading here lacks also tension. 

The degree of specialisation simply makes certain attractions worthless to each player. Makes trading a little too straightforward and lacking any downside. What to trade away and what to acquire is usually quite obvious. Merely the exact price becomes the issue.

Yet what really irks me about the trading phase is that money doesn't appear scarce enough in this game. This isn't offset by money being of consequence in scoring. Money thus may almost become worthless in trades. A player with good cashflow of his own simply does not need any further money.

This issue of mine is of course tied to my experience of most auctions not being too contested. Were the auctions pricier, money would be scarcer and thus also once again of greater value as a trade commodity. But as said, specialisation discourages for the most part auctions spiralling high without any special tiles being involved.

ROLL & MOVE:

This element being added to the game seems like a rather desperate attempt to jazz up the game given that its auction phase does not generate the fun and excitement Ra, Traumfabrik or Modern Art generate.
Questionable design, IMO, as the roll & move stuff really doesn't add much depth or fun to the game. Not to mention it being a pretty unthematic manner in which to portray the political élite's favour.

CONCLUSION:

The auction, trading and roll & move mechanics all aren't particularly successful in this game. Perhaps that's why they were all thrown in as a (not particularly convincing) compensatory measure.

So where's the heart of the game? It's in the formulation of a master gameplan. That involves a detailed study of the whole spectacles play aid. A little "spreadsheet analysis" going on here. That may be intellectually challenging, but is it FUN?!?

Don't get me wrong. This is a solid, albeit rather workmanlike, game. It works. But, rightly or wrongly, I expect more from one of the most respected designers out there with such winners as Torres, Maharajah or El Grande under his belt. 

This game gives me in many respects an Emira déjà-vu. Fortunately, it works a lot better than that somewhat troubled game. I don't dislike Colosseum, but I can't say I'm overly impressed either. I miss the elusive spark which really makes a game FUN!

A year and a hlaf later and it looks like I have only played this game 4 times.  Wow, since I do have it in my top 10 list  and I really do enjoy it.  I am seeingthe strategy of making sure you stay in the back the whole game (except the last turn obviously) and having the Emperor's logue from the beginning.  Next time I play I think that doing the slow play will work tremendously.  I still stand by my rating but probably need to not have it in my top 10 any more.  (9/26/10)

I'm a big fan of DOW games, and this one did not disappoint me. As always with DOW games, the board and pieces are beautifully done. Game play reminds me of Power Grid, with a lot of planning involved to get spectacles that fit with your resources and getting the additional resources needed to complete your spectacle. I like that there is not a lot of "randomness" to the game.

A classic presentation game with a non cumulative intermediate scoring. Everything works in this and timing is key. There's two ways to play and I'm unsure which is better.

Another beautiful game from Days of Wonder.  Where others slam DoW, I applaud.  Their big box games are all worth playing and this one is no exception.  The only knock is that there seems to be only a singular starting strategy.  Where Princes of Florence uses the auction to help deviate player strategy, it is used here to keep the players from selecting the same path.  Not as good for sure, but still interesting.

It seems like the only way to win is to do as little as possible while preparing for your big end-game show. Just make sure you have enough cash for investments and a little for auctions. If you start at the beginning, it seems relatively easy to accomplish this. After that, it seems to come down to who gets lucky with where the VIPs are on the board at the end. If you could win multiple auctions/investments and dominate with money, this might make things much more interesing. As it is, a scripted bore. Awesome production value again from Days of Wonder though. Makes it worth one play if you know someone with a copy.

Rating after 1 play with 3 players. Quite enjoyable. Not sure if it is worth the hype or not, I will have to wait until I have tried it with 4 or 5..... Update, after 3 years or so, I still haven't got this to the table a second time. Just seems to long and complicated, when you could play Princes of Florence, or about 8 games of Wasabi in the same time. Moving the counciller mechanic seems half baked. Dropped rating to 7, 6 for the game, +1 for beutiful cardboard.

Colosseum is a very interesting game which I really enjoyed (the game was very close and all four of us could have won so it was extra exciting). We played with the official intense auction variant which, by reading the rules, seems much more interesting. The trades afterwards were perhaps slightly boring as you would often end up with lots of stuff and didn’t really want to trade a lot, especially at the end. However, I don’t see this as a negative as the trading in the first place is not what makes Colosseum such a fine game.

There are several reasons why I liked Colosseum. I liked how you needed to collect different tiles to run your shows (and that you had to discard a tile afterwards). There are several shows you can invest in during the game, but if you want to have a shot of winning you need to expand your personal colosseum so you can host bigger races. This also helps when you move the pawns on the main board which you use in order to maximize points by making them visit your colosseum, or when you move the pawns to get medals which can be used for various things during the game or at the game end. I liked how you roll dice and move the different valued pawns and how the main board was shared with each player’s own colosseum.
 
But what I really loved about Colosseum and what makes it such a unique game is the victory condition! You win the game by having the highest score in any of the 5 rounds; your points don’t cumulate in each round which is ingenious and a very refreshing mechanic. Also, because of this you don’t want to be in front in the beginning but rather slightly behind so you can steal a tile from the leader. Of course you can’t be too far behind as you won’t get enough money to use on the development of your arena and outbidding the others for the good tiles, so it’s something you need to balance. 

All in all Colosseum was a big hit with me and I would love to play it again and perhaps even purchase it. However, it’s OOP so I might accept that I’m only going to play it once a year at Djengis Con like I did this time. We were four players and I feel it was a good amount of people. I think 3 and 5 would be fine too as the auctions aren’t really that interesting compared to other auction games which really need 5 players. 
Oh, an update: I got the opportunity to buy this game, took it, and have played it a couple of times more. It's still innovative and great! Highly recommended.

One play so far. Interesting set collection game with Roman games theme and very nicely produced counters, etc. Unusual scoring mechanic whereby players only count their best round (of 5). The game works well until the last round when trading grinds to a halt or the end is determined by kingmaking as all information is open.

VERY FUN! FUN is the best word to describe this game! This is a game that looks heavy, but is simple enough that I can get my non-gaming family to play with me. The negotiating and trading works so well and you really feel like you're trying to put the best possible show on. Great way to introduce phase-style turns, bidding, and planning for end game benefits to new players.

Seems to be able to encompas a fairly large audience as a result of the different styles of gameplay.  Also quite a beautiful game to play.

RATING: 5
First play with three people, and we had a blast. Loved the degree of interaction, and loved the building tension and sense of drama with that "last big show."

This seems like it has enough meat for regular gamers, but could still be an option for someone who needs something after Ticket to Ride.

Update: One observation after a handful of plays... there's a lot going on in this game. Most games take approx. 2 hours. Couple that with the long-term planning, and it's not exactly a game that is ideal for those looking for their next game after Ticket to Ride. I still like it, but it's a bit of a "gamer's game." And yet, some gamers may not like the elements of luck thrown in. I don't mind it, but then again, I'm not luck-phobic.

Update: Downgraded this to a "7." I still like it... I admire it for its eclectic mix of elements, and I love the long-term strategy of aiming for the final show. But... the game continues to last a bit longer than I'd like, and the trading element is sometimes underwhelming. Also, auctions are not always tense, with a number of lots going for the minimum value. Still glad to own it though.

Downgraded to a "6" and traded away along with Thunderstone for a copy of Nexus Ops. Ultimately, it's a game with a number of things that I really appreciate (theme, long-term planning) but with enough flaws (time frame, weak trading) that it won't hit the table.

Downs: The symbols on the original asset tokens were simpler, and the symbol/color on the star performer tile correlated to asset tokens better before; not so clear now.

Endless chrome. And for what? A game of planning where everything hinges on luck? Bleh. A negotiation game where the negotiations are flaccid little exercises in one-mans-trash...? No thanks. The high-striker mechanism is redeeming in its novelty, but even so can lead to a more than one player sitting out the last round to see if their score holds up.

Good game with a balanced auction mechanic that is driving the game a little too much, but still is good.  The trading is ok but could have been better.  I like how the game naturaly scale over the 5 rounds.  What I don't like is how influancial the starting position of the different figures is.  

Overall a cool game that is relaxing and fun and change our gamer scenery every now and then.

On 13-Apr-2012 : Revised from 7.4 to 8.0 because of how the game is better at 5 players.  I would recommend the game for serious but not overly competitive player as the trade phase is more attractive when you're semi-cooping everyone.  Still think it's a nice change of pace every now and then

A fun, light auction game.  Some of my friends don't like the intensity of Power Grid, but love this game.  The theme is also perfect.  You are a Roman colosseum owner and it is your job to put on entertaining shows.  You bid on the services of actors and props in the market and then try to get the emperor and senators to attend your show.  The theme really comes to life when players start announcing their shows.

RATING: 5
I got this an a very low price during a moving sale as more of a curio than anything. I played it once and found it intriguing - the need to constantly put on bigger and bigger spectacles to slowly bump up your points was something I haven't seen in any other board game.

It's also a surprisingly heavier game than you'd expect from Days of Wonder, and has a lot of different systems going on in it.

However, after rolling this one around in my head for a while, I decided I didn't like it as much as I originally thought. It's a very, very dry euro game, despite how colorful and interesting the art and components are. The thing that killed it for me is that once someone is on a path to get a certain program, there's barely anything you can do to stop them. It then becomes a game of very static, one-dimensional decisions that exist in a vacuum. The winner was typically whoever we thought was going to win around halfway through. I don't think this is a bad game by a far shot, but it never really occupied my thoughts with ways to better my play after finishing. Just very bland.

I'm hesitating between this and Princes of Florence. I know, I know... PoF has a much higher rating and seems tighter but Colosseum has a lot going for it in my position: I love trading as much as auction. This might be a good combo. Plus, I LOVE the thematic of the game. If I choose PoF over Colosseum, I'll need a good suggestion for a game involving trades.

One of those games who looks good and plays well.

This game has some of the best components of any game I've ever played and it is dripping with theme. The actual gameplay is a little uninspiring, mainly consisting of an auction and trade mechanism, but it plays a good amount of people (6) and can be very fun if people don't take it too seriously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Colosseum = Wolfgang Kramer to revising elements of several old game systems (yet again) and putting together a game that is close to working, but not quite there.

Colosseum is a game of investments and timing. The core idea of the game is somewhat similar to a combination of Princes of Florence and Leonardo da Vinci with a smattering of Power Grid. The PoF and Leonardo comments are because it is a game of long term planning, where you acquire items (PoF) to meet certain menus that are presented to you (Leonardo). Like Power Grid, staying in the back of the pack can be a very good thing.

The basic structure of the game is simple: buy a thing (i.e.: a fresh menu, an upgrade for your colosseum). Then win some elements of an exciting show in an auction. Then possibly swap some items around. Then move the various personages around the board with dice. Finally, put on a show and get some cash. The best singular show presented in the game is the winner.

So this game wants to appeal to my long term planner side. It is possible to be planning for the last turn on the first one with this, as the different menus are all available for purchase early, and buying the various show elements in lots of 3 means that knowing what you want immediately, and what you'll want down the road is important.

Yes, there is certainly luck here though. The way the bonus point hand-out pieces move is dice-driven, and though you can affect those odds, they still can burn you, badly. The way the lots are replenished can often be an important random aspect as well, particularly if you want a certain tile or tiles, but they just will not show their faces.

All of this said, I initially found this an enjoyable enough medium-heavy planning game. It's not as serious as most of the games that it borrows from, but it seems to carry its theme decently well (even though it is abstracted) and I think it offered enough twists to give it some legs.

On the downside, after a couple of plays, I am starting to wonder about the effect that the pawns have on the game. The scoring bonuses they offer are extremely important, and the last turn of the game, where the big show is held, seems to hinge heavily on where they end up. This sours me on the game experience as a whole because so much seems to ride on that last turn. If you can position the pawns where you need them for the final stanza you'll almost undoubtedly win this, and too often that ability to control the pawns is out of your hands.

One final caveat, this might be a family game for those of us who have families who play a lot of Euro games, but this is not something I would buy cold for non-gamers. The system has a lot of nuances at work, so even though there are random elements that give the less experienced a chance to get some decent deals, the overall learning curve here is fairly high.

Overall: almost a solid design. Too much rides on the final turn pawn positions for my tastes though, and I am not particularly interested in playing this again, though I would at least be willing to with some light arm-twisting.

RATING: 7.5
I liked this one a lot, but damn, there were a lot of fiddly bits.  We spent fully 2 1/2 hours playing it, with 5 players, making a mockery of the estimated playing time.  The rules explaining took more than half an hour alone.  I can just barely imagine that with experienced players, you might cram a game in in 90 minutes, but 60?  That boggles the mind.  Anyway, it would be a good 90 minutes, and the game has, I think, very high replayability.

As per usual with Days of Wonder, this is a beautifully produced game that looks great on the table. It plays really well but can tend towards being a bit too mathy towards the end of the game as people can try to calculate what others final scores will probably be to try and judge relative values and what actions they should take. Probably not too fun with players with AP problems.

RATING: N/A
Rated after one play.  This is not a game that I can play with my group, it is quite busy feeling, and in our game the difference between first and third was determined by whether or not someone wanted to move the emperor and play kingmaker.  It was somewhat fun to play but waiting two hours to make your final, killer move and find out if you won isn't that good of a time, I suppose.  Still, it feels like there is a good game in there trying to get out, and I sort of enjoyed playing it but felt like my agency was severely constrained.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable game, like a less clunky Trickerion with trading. My only gripe is that the dice rolling mechanic governing the movement of the nobles feels a bit out of place. I can't think of another way they could have done it, but I can't help but feel it could have been implemented in a more elegant way. Still, a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've played a few games that have a similar outlook (e.g. Drum Roll) where you are building up from one round to the next before a final hurrah but this for me is the best of them, components included.

The only downside is the trading phase which seems a bit contrived and stale as it's quite obvious what will benefit others so you'll likely only get what you need or want if you have something particularly valuable for someone else, in which case it might be better not bothering. I guess you could say that about any trading but here it feels more faltering as there's no real room for bluff or negotiation.

Other than that though I love the game and the round progression. It can be a bit long with 5 but not too bad if everyone knows what they're doing.

Rating based on only one play.

The components are up to your typical eurogame standard, with mounted board, nice chunky cardboard pieces, and some wooden components. What is really nice are the cool wooden pawns for the Emperor, Consuls, and Senators. The pawns wear robes and wear laurels. Pretty sweet.

The was kind of fun, but took way longer than it should have for what you get. I know it was our first game and we were a little chatty, but it took almost three hours! The 60-90 minutes listed is bullshit. This is easily a 2 hour game, as it is very prone to analysis paralysis. I will try it again though.

So pretty but so boring.  The game tries to get its spice from the market/trade phase, but no one ever wants to trade (I guess we're burned out on hundreds of games of Settlers) so you kid of roll with what you get.  Oh, and get a bad tile mix and miss a round and you're pretty much out of it.

Create lavish Roman Colosseum shows by acquiring assets via auction and negotiation with other players.  Then try to bring important people to view your production for extra points.  Some fun, but play can run a bit long, especially when using house rules which it really needs for the negotiation part.  Negotiating in turn order is completely broken, as it leaves the last player totally out in the cold, because all other deals will have been made by then.  Instead, the negotiation phase is best with a free-for-all style.  Some variants allow for multiple auctions to be one by a single player, which extends play time dramatically and increases the chance of having a runaway leader.

Only 1 play. I liked it. My kids liked it. I didn't realize until after the game that the back side of the player aid has a menu of all the shows you can put on. Oops. That would have been helpful. Wasn't really sure how to bid. Like most bidding games, I expect it gets better with people who have a better feel for what things are worth. I wasn't super fond of the nobles though. Roll a die, and depending on the result either help yourself or hurt someone else.

After first play I am giving this game a 5.1 rating played on 03-08-2008.  The auction mechanic seemed messed up with just 3 players, you never see most of the asset tokens.  We did miss the rule for "star performer" so we do want to give it another go before passing full judgement.  Played with 4 on 7-4-08 and it is definitely better with 4 than with 3.  Nobles still don't move much & bidding / auction still seemed broken, but it is much better than with 3 players.  Still on the trade pile.  Added 7-5-07

Played twice, only with 3 players. The auction phase becomes very stale with 3 players only, with everyone basically always receiving his bid uncontested. I can see how a 5 player game would a lot more competition for tight resources. It would make the game much longer though.

Still, I enjoy it. I find the rules very easy to learn/teach. The production value is one of the best I have ever seen. A keeper, but I wish it would hit the floor more often.

For the most part, I really enjoy Colosseum. My only hang-up is the negotiation phase, which could (inadvertently) lead to king-making situations. In some groups, the negotiation phase could really slow the game down too.

Without the negotiation phase, I would rate Colosseum a solid 8.

seemed like a cross between Princes of Florence and Traders of Genoa, but then with a luck element added.
Not a fan on a first play, but it seems like a game that might take 3-4 plays to begin to understand.

Doesn't work at all with three, and can safely say I won't be suggesting this one again.

Played a partial (let's learn the rules and get familiar with the mechanics) game today.  Classic DoW game...easy to learn, moderate play time, good theme.  Really, it was a lot of fun.  I look forward to playing it for real.

Played another game a couple of days later.  It is quite fun, but I'm not sure that it will have staying power.  (Perhaps I'm just saying that because I find it too easy to win when playing against the twins...maybe in a couple of years...)

I am a sucker for Ancient Rome themes! This one has a good combo of mechanics, rich player interaction.  Includes one of my favorite elements which is "really screw your buddy over," and its very appearant in this game when it's a group effort to do so.  After three plays I am still trying to figure out a good strategy, as there seem to be many that will work.

Components: Lots of cool components. The board is beautiful, and the gladiators, priests, ships, et al. all look really cool. Basically not a thing wrong, except the box is too tight.

Experience: Moves very quickly, and is over before I know it. With only five rounds, I will do well just to complete five events (and there's no shame in performing the same event twice; give the audience what they want to see!). The bidding isn't very tense with three players, but the negotiation can be, especially when it becomes obvious that two players are trying to win over the champions, or are pursuing the same event (that neither has yet purchased).

RATING: 8
Another Days of Wonder gem.  Great production value... looks great on the table.  Rather than dice rolling and gladatorial combat, as you might expect, this is an auction game with some interesting decisions to be made.  One of the most intriguing features is, the scoring is not cumulative.  Whoever has the single best round over the course of the whole game wins.  So, you're never really out of it for sure, which gives everyone a chance right down to the wire.  The only drawback is that the rules are a bit more involved than other DoW games like Ticket to Ride, but once learned, they are intuitive and lots of fun to play.

The auctions aren't very interesting, and considering this is a game largely built on an auction dynamic, this is disappointing. The production values of this game are off-the-hook, but what underlies the bling is a fairly non-interactive experience that largely revolves around picking a third-stage event program, rather dully acquiring a tile set to fit it, occasionally moving around a few pawns to your area to augment your spectators, and trying to hit one big score. I initially thought a dynamic where your final score is just whichever is your round's best (in 5 rounds) would be a novel dynamic, but in reality, there isn't enough meaning to each of the individual rounds. So, it's an OK game. Maybe it'll grow on me with another play or two, but someone else will have to nominate this one hit the table again....

Nothing inherantely wrong with it as it's very fun and there is allot of strat, the amount of bits can be daunting but days of wonder again produces a superb product making setup and clean up a snap considering.

The last play session, I was behind each turn until the last.

I somehow built the lowest 3rd tier (I think it was 21 and cost 25) event and had every piece, it took me 3 turns of planning to do it. I ended up beating out the guy who dominated and bullied us around all game in bidding by being able to take a key resource from him on the last turn as well, coupled with somehow (luck) getting the 1,1,2 nobles in my event.

A very pleasent game.

It´s very well balanced and conceived, it fits very well into the theme and forces the player to have some skill management over the (short) available money, using it wheter to upgrade its structures, bid on tiles or buying licences for shows.
Also very nice ideias are the ways of trying to capture senators, consuls or the emperor to attend one´s show (more points/money awarded) and the scoring system i believe is unique: The final score is given only by the greatest score (value of the show) achieved in any of the five rounds of the game (usually the last one, but not necessarily so). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game really suffers from slow play from analysis paralysis players.  The downtime can be tremendous if you don't continue to harp on slow players--and who wants to do that?  Other than that, I thought the game was fun and fair.  

Similar to Power Grid, there is a catch-up mechanism, and players who trail the entire game can sneak up for the win!

Number one game in my family, fortunately. It has two things that appeal family and non gamers.

- One of the best games I have played in 2011.

Colosseum is an interesting mix of resource management, auctions, and Diplomacy style negotiations.  It is a very solid game, but it has a few aspects that don't sit well with me.  

The main thing I dislike that there much of my time is spent sifting through a multitude of options in order to make one decision.  I feel like I need a secretary to keep track of everything when I play this game.  If only my secretary could lay out the viable options, then I could look the few remaining options make a decision about what to do.  Unfortunately, I'm the person who has to look through the chart of possible shows, then look through all of the show tiles to see the score of missing some of the components, etc.  This process grinds the game to a halt for the last 2 rounds, even with players who are not prone to AP.

A beautiful production and a great unique theme (producing shows, that is... ancient Rome is not unique).  The trouble with this game is that it can cause intense analysis paralysis.  The game is wisely designed such that one cannot produce a series of shows all using the same resources, so you must adapt your resources between each production.  But it is easy to get trapped into trying to find that perfect combination and I see other players staring at the list of shows trying to figure out a perfect path through the game.

This should play in 90 minutes, but can go 60-90 minutes longer.  When that happens, it really drags.

Not sure what to think after 1 play.  I liked it but some of the mechanisms seem to be a bit off.  The auction in particular doesn't seem to have enough "action".  There is not enough bidding.  Usually the auctioneer gets whatever he put up for the minimum 8 coins.  Unlike some reviewers, I felt the trading was fine.  All in all a fun game to play, it just lacks the "tightness" that I've come to expect from Eurogames.

Traded away.

The first time I played Colosseum I was pretty impressed. It seemed to be a more fun version of Princes of Florence, despite not being quite as good as that game. Unfortunately, my second play of the game left me seriously underwhelmed. In the end, I think all of the chrome added to Colosseum hides what is ultimately an inferior game, with only one real path to victory, and even fewer interesting decisions. Blah.

RATING: 8
Players are Roman producers, putting on a nice, expensive production down at the old amphitheater.  Players take turns to play through phases - expand, purchase, trade commodities in order to increase the lavishness of their productions (e.g. "Bacchus and the Nymphs").  Productions take place at the end of the turn, earning cash and a peg on the current victory point scoreboard.  The winner of the game is the player who earned the highest VP score at any point during the game (theoretically you can win on turn 1, I guess).  Large, colourful, lavish, and in this age where we've seen it all before, not a bad game at all.  Perhaps a bit prone to over-analysis in your first game or two, but it settles down and speeds up nicely after that.  A nice surprise.

Didn't care for the trading phase in my recent 5-player game, dragged on far too long each turn (I'm not a fan of trading in general, anyway). Also didn't like the roll-and-move aspect of the pawns. Lastly, not sure how to express this, but I don't like how many little ways there are to score points - are there too many ways? Not a favorite.

I felt this game was mostly frustrating when we played it, which is my usual experience with Euros.  We thought we messed up on a rule or two, but rereading stuff now I am not so sure.

Had a great time playing this. Great components too. As usual for a Kramer game, it has a delicate balance of rules simplicity and tough decisions. Somewhat reminiscent of Princes of Florence, but more intuitive for new players. The big difference though is that your final production is the only thing that really matters for scoring. This definitely makes the game unique but I'm not sure if I like that style of game better than the usual victory point accumulation. I would like to play this again!

Intimidating bits, but surprisingly straight forward. The pace is a little too slow - there's too much to keep track of from across the table for the resulting depth of the game. The player interaction is fairly limited. To impact another player is to sabotage your own plans in most cases. That said, it seems that familiarity with the events, and strategy trends in your group would make this game more interesting and less taxing.

Second play was a little easier. However, I suspect that this game is simply one of optimized play - which leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Not sure I would enjoy the trading or some of the random elements thrown in here, not to mention the forced-catch up mechanism of last place player taking a resource from first place.  Seems like a family-friendisized Princes of Florence.

UPDATE: I bought it and played it a few times with my family, after trading Princes of Florence for being too dry.  This game certainly has more flavor, but is overall an even more milquetoast gaming experience.  The auction, ostensibly the central mechanism of the game, is frequently uncontested.  There is also potential for AP as people study the program card.  

That all being said, this is a very beautifully produced, pleasant family game, and I'll happily play it.  The catch-up mechanism actually works pretty well in the context of the game.  The limited actions possible between auctions keeps everything nicely under control.  However, it does make the gamer in me crave Medici for a truly great auction, and good ol Catan is a better trading game.  I could also recommend Vega Showdown as an auction game of about this weight that is overall more interesting.

The trading phase, while essential to getting the components you need, really bogs it down - unless you use completely wide open free-form trading.   The auctions are fairly anti-climactic.  There's some good stuff here, though, I just kind of wish it fit together a little differently.  After a few plays, it seems that holding back (so that you can steal free tiles from the leaders) and hoarding medals is a dominant strategy.

Terrific game.  Well-themed, zips along, grows to a climax during each turn, and there are different routes to victory.  You can win without a Big show at the end of round 5, I just saw it done!   Perhaps the auctions and trading are a let down.  Auctions rarely become competitive, whilst trading is unsubtle and a this-for-that type of swing to it.  

But truely a good 5 player game and suitable for moving on from Ticket to Ride for more casual gamers.

The 2017 version should be avoided. The art is ridiculous, tacky and poorly done. The rules have typos starting from the first page.

They printed a reminder token instead of just fixing the piece design. Solution to a problem that shouldn't exist.

Not 60-90 minutes if you put in the needed time to actually determine what's going on and make good choices. Invites analysis, but has randomness which makes it useless to actually do out the analysis fully. Really, really not my kind of game. I guess in a group which played it very lightly, and had played it several times, it'd be okay. One play was enough for me, though - back to games I know I like.

The problem with this game is that being in the lead during the game makes it progressively harder.  No one wants to be in the lead under the very last turn, and will play for smaller scores just to ensure that.  Then the last turn everyone makes their move.

Solid game.  Very well balanced.  There are contested elements between the players, but there are no direct "attack" mechanisms. (which is good for players that take personal offense to attack-style tactics!)

Whenever I have 3 or more players rearin' for a game, this is the game I want to play.  It has upgrades, auctions, set collection, trading, dice rolling, economy, and a great scoring mechanic - you're only as good as your best show.  Colosseum has never failed to enamor itself with new players.  There's a lot going on, but the excellent player aid guides you through every step of the process.  The pieces are sturdy, well designed, and beautiful.  The fudge in the brownie is that many of the production assets can be linked to a part that Russel Crowe has played in a movie.  This game is my cheeseburger!

Rules are slightly daunting at first, but really it clips along at a great pace very quickly.  Most of the apparent complexity on the board elements are really helpful player aids once you know what you're doing.

BUT, regardless, fantastic theme and gameplay, and some of the best components I've ever seen.  LOVE the roman meeples!  I really only ding it from a 9 because I wish there was another turn of gameplay, it seems like any inefficiency early in the game will cripple your end game, which is harsh on newer players.

The theme on this game is very powerful, backed by mechanics that just seem to fit. While you could call the main mechanic a simple auction, it adds in just enough other stuff to make it a brilliant game. The only downside is the length, which can take up to 3 hours.

Pretty good, not great.  I prefer the intense auction variant, which seems to reduce the luck of the tile draws allowing players to bid on more than one lot.

Reminded me a lot of Cleopatra but cleverer. It is a Kramer game so you can get some mileage out of it. Unfortunately, the cleverness feels hodge-podge and bland. This is a game that was a little bit too long, not much player interaction and it felt that the mechanics were put together to keep the game moving but no real thought as to how it all fit together. The theming also felt a little bit weird - it's like Broadway in Rome.

I didn't have high hopes for this, and found myself enjoying it more than I had expected.  Then I looked at the box and realized it was a Kramer game - no wonder.

I quite like the scoring method, as the planning for a single big turn provides a different challenge from the usual accumulations and gives a rare chance to think longer-term without an over-weighted end turn.  This feels more honest and up front.

My group and I like this one way more than we should. Between the way tiles come out and the dice rolls (gotta get those nobles on the last turn), results can be swingy. Seems like we have a close finish between two people each game and the other three are out of it, but it's still fun to try and be one of those two people. We really  need to play the advanced variant next time where you can buy more than one tile per turn.

preliminary rating based on 1 play. Many harder decisions than I expected, more strategic than the lightish game I was expecting. These are all good things.

RATING: 7
A fun and innovative game about putting on performances in ancient Rome.  It takes some real planning and negotiating to get the tiles needed for that final big show.

Colosseum scales pretty well, though the auctions using the standard rules seem to work better with more players.  With three, I think the intense variant would be needed to make this more interactive and competitive, and is what we will do next.  Four or five seems to be the ideal number.

Overall, Colosseum is a very enjoyable, relatively easy to teach, and not too deep family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really liked the auction and trading parts, but the building phase felt way too mechanical. Maybe more games would change that feeling, but I doubt I'll get around to it. Seems like a huge advantage for the player starting his Colosseum next to the emperor as he gets two go arounds. There were just too many nagging things about this game for me to rate it higher than a 6. Surprised by the high ranking of this one.

Really enjoyed this game. I played the old version. A lot of interesting things going on, especially is the scoring system quite unique. It's a dilemma if you should lead or be a little behind (or last). Leading means more money, while being last means that you can get one tile from the leading player. A really tight game, where there nothing is certain until the very end. The auction mechanics could be a little more interesting and fresh, though.

Wow!

Knowing how difficult it is to find this game I'm surprised I got to play this at all. It's got a lot of forward planning and can get a bit mathsy, especially on the later rounds, but it is a fantastic experience.
Each part of a round offers a diverse range of good options limited by your money and, especially in the auction phase, other players actions. Knowing when to upgrade, what tiles to buy or which you can trade for, what to negotiate with, what shows to put on and if you have the necessary conponents, all of it never wearing out it's welcome make this game absolutely amazing and deserving of a Days of Wonder deluxe edition.
It must also be said that the physical nature of building up your Colosseum with tiled components that make your arena come to life is one of the most satisfying parts of the game and serve to remind you that it isn't JUST an arena but YOUR arena. At the end you feel a sense of satisfaction in that.

Of all the games I've played this has been my favourite so far.

I love the theme on this and the game play is very engaging and yet easy to pick up. 5 turns may have been a little long for a single game however 4 turns would have felt very short.

The game is really nice and the scoring only your highest show mechanic is nice but it does mean you can essentially clear up on the final round and never actually play the rest of the rounds.

If only a few players are moving the roman figures around it gets a bit skewed and therefore more difficult to catch up as you have to dedicate more resources to moving the guys further and less to the show you are putting on.

The tokens are really nicely designed as the colouring on them is very distinct and so you can tell from across the table what a player has a a glance. This makes trade discussions easier as there is no real hidden information.

Did not play well as an auction game for 3 people out of the box.  There's little to no competition in bids with the large number of available programs and diverse number of assets to bid on.  Would probably play well with 5 as bids would go higher on average.  3 player version needs modification.  Perhaps fewer programs or filling fewer markets, not sure yet.

Bidding & fulfilling events smacks of the mechanics in Princes of Florence & Hollywood Blockbuster.  Others felt the game a little fiddly, but I didn't think so--to me, Mousetrap is fiddly.  The beautiful board & pieces are a delight to play with. The mechanics of the building of the colosseum is different & adds some light strategy with character pieces being able to move through it.  I know I will enjoy playing it a few more times.  I must say, the insert fits the game pieces very nicely & putting it away is a pleasure since everything fits.

The production values are fantastic and I thought this game was a good experience, but it played a little too long for what it is.  The manner of movement of the emperor, consuls and senators is difficult to manipulate (especially with the full complement of players), so can be a little off-putting (and is the main reason I rate this at 7).

Fantastically produced game as always from DOW.  Luckily for us it didn't disappoint delivering a well rounded game, if a little long, using many of our favourite mechanisms.

Rating after a single 3 player game. The material is gorgeous, with so much cardboard you feel you've bought a whole tree. The game, however, is bland. The similarities with Princes of Florence are numerous. The '''action phase''' is there, but it doesn't seem to offer the array of strategies available in PoF. Moreover, you are not really constrained to "5 actions during the game" since you can get medals and exchange them agains more actions. This really lowers the tension. The '''auction phase''' is similar, but there are so many lots that there is none that you really want. Consequently, bids stay very low and this feels more like a second "action phase". (This is exacerbated by the fact that selected lots are randomly replaced. Moreover, you can always trade for the tile you really need.) The '''construction phase''' is there also, but since points are not cumulative you don't really need to optimize each of your moves. In fact, your often better off finishing last with just enough money to keep going and an extra tile you steal from the leader.To top it off, this game is '''dominated through and through with luck'''. Roll dice, get guys in your arena: earn points. Roll dice, get guys on a starting spot, earn points or (better) extra actions. Draw tiles, get a joker, earn loads of points.I have to try it with more than 3 players, but with this number its no better than a 5/10.

Colosseum is a beautifully produced game, and I am a Kramer fan anyway, so this is a winner, right? Well. The underlying features are all fine and dandy but there a few notable detractors. 

Obviously there is quite a bit of luck in the drawing of chits from the bag but the more problematic part is the die-controlled movement of the Caesar, senators, and consuls. They can cause huge swings, and whether you can get them to visit your arena or not is just too random. Another sore point is the completely open trading which can easily unbalance the game and offers great kingmaking potential. Somewhat stricter trading rules would have benefitted the game a lot, especially since money is otherwise quite useless.

On the plus side, since only your best round is important for the final scoring pretty much everyone is in the running until the final round although those who have won previous rounds may have acquired considerable bonuses on the way.

RATING: 6
PRO - Game board and components are very nice.  Play time is just right.  Cool theme.

CON - There seems to be only one strategy to winning.  Stay in the middle of the pack and be a good horse trader.  Don't like how the auction phase works. Using the base auction rules you always seem to be more than a few tiles short of producing one of the larger programs.  I can see making it harder to produce these, but it almost seems impossible without using the 'extreme' auction rules.

Ein Werk aus dem unerschöpflichen Fundus des Dauer-Autoren-Duos Kramer/Kiesling ... ähhh Kramer/Lübke. Womöglich macht die Personalie hier den Unterschied: COLOSSEUM ist besser als manches Spiel aus der Gesamtwerkstanze der beiden Grandseigneure. Das Artwork von Days of Wonder in verlagsgewohnter Üppigkeit. Den visuellen Aspekt hat das Reissue von TMG mit einer leichteren, humorvollen Note neu umgesetzt und zurück in die Neuzeit gebracht. In dieser wirkt das damals Allseits-Thema Rom heute wie eine Erfrischung mit Strohhalm. Zudem wirkt das Spieldesign von COLOSSEUM im Kontext des heutigen Vielspielerkomplexität klar und aufgeräumt, wenn auch etwas von zu zielgerichteter Straightness. Zurück in der Arena ist COLOSSEUM einen Blick wert.

Fun, if a bit light for my tastes.

Core gameplay of building a colosseum and putting on shows was satisfying.

Trading feels mean when some players get left out because they're not loud enough.

Interesting mechanic that only your best turn's score counts. Led to some odd out-of-theme gameplay where players didn't put on a show in one round because they didn't need to (I have since been told that's not allowed - still would have tanked that round :P).

While this may seem like a harsh rating, it's honest. It would be extremely difficult to convince me to play this game again.

Colosseum feels like a cross between Settlers and Power Grid, but generally fails to have the redeeming qualities of either.

There's way too many variables that are luck dependent. The figures that revolve around the track can make a huge difference in the game, and you have rather little control over them. The auction mechanic severely screws over whoever goes first. The fact that the last round is the only one that matters, and the fact that there's a mechanic that helps the player in last place means it's a perfectly viable strategy to do not compete until the end of the game. Power Grid may penalize the leader, but at least in that game you have to keep up with the joneses.

All in all, I thought Colosseum was severely flawed.

I don't like how your initial tile draw can dictate what you need to do for the majority of the game.  You're almost locked into a few of the performances, and if your tiles don't come up for auction it can be difficult to catch up to the leaders.

That said, I always feel like I need one more turn, which is a good thing.

I liked this very much, on one play, although it did take us far longer than it ought, but I think the length was down to our trying to optimise moves in absence of a proper understanding of the relative values and liklihoods of things.  I invested in grabbing some Priests early on, and was hamstrung by a curious lack of both torches and jokers subsequently - it seemed that Preists and torches have an affinity... :-)

After all these years, I finally picked up a copy. What a good game (family game, especially). It has all the elements to make interesting play; set collection, auctioning, trading (which is a bit weak in this, but not bad), and dice rolling (roll & move). Fun stuff. And the theme holds it all together. But definitely overrated. Not a fan of Monopoly style roll & move games, but the other game features save it somewhat.

Exciting and all-round game. You need to think further, need to buy goods from the marketplace, need to focus on your opponent's things, and so on.
Disadvantage could be the relatively big place to play and a total gameplay takes approx. 3 hours. A little bit takes too long for me to play with this game every weekend.

Standard Days of Wonder fare: high production values, and a fun game that won't tax the brain too heavily.

The outcome has a sizeable share of randomness that depends on die rolls, initial tile selection, and the somewhat chaotic interactions of the pawn movements.

A beautiful looking game but sadly there is really only one path to victory and thus has very little replayability once you've learned it.

Also a single die-roll has too much influence on the game, very little player interaction.

Despite is great bits, it's a rather dull game.

After one play, I found Colosseum to be very disappointing.  Too much randomness (a roll and move mechanic which is one of two reasons to expand your arena), an auction that lacks tension, a trading phase that mostly succeeds in dragging out the game, far too many spectacles and resources to track, and basically the game comes down to the last turn.  Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is much cleaner, shorter, and a whole lot more fun to play.

RATING: 5
To keep a decent pace to the game & have a good time, you have to play "by the seat of your pants" - in other words, without doing a lot of detailed point-counting and/or evaluating all of the other player's casts.

To play competitively, you have to do all of the number-crunching & planning, which slows the game down to a miserable pace.

Darned if you do, darned if you don't... which is too bad, because there are some great ideas & production here - just not a great game.

BillJ1967 said everything I wanted to say already. Worth repeating:

"Auctions, followed by trading, all in an effort to build sets makes for a tedious game. But wait...there's more. Throw in the good ol' 'roll and move' mechanic and you've got the makings of a real stinker. The game forces players to know the 30 or so 'show' designs in order to be successful - which means constantly referring to the player aid chart. A very slow game only made even more special with a dash of analysis paralysis, too! What more could anybody want?!? Well, Colosseum also provides an abusive catch-up mechanic and a scoring system where after 2-3 hours of play only the last turn matters! Now, that's entertainment!"

There are not so many strategies of winning but bidding phase makes this game worth playing.

According to the persons I played with Colosseum works well only in five players and after my first play I would agree.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, beautiful bits.  Playing with 3 there is not a lot of interaction with auctions, with 5 it seemed to drag a little towards the finish - got to kick those over-analysers along.  Playing with the auction variant that allows you to buy more than one set (but only 1 per player's auction turn) seems to work OK, but swaps one problem (less interesting auctions)with another (too many chits).  Can be a kingmaker aspect to trades (trading to allow someone else to steal the Masters off the leader) at the finish which we didn't like.

i like it better with the bidding variant, but the game just seems like more of a chore than a game to me. There is never any real sense of who is going to win, and there is next to nothing that you can do about preventing others from winning, except just play your game to your advantage and the least advantage of others. I will play it again sometime, but hopefully not right away or I might not want to play it ever again...  It really does seem like moreof a JOB than a GAME o me, so i suppose if you paid me i would play it, but even then, i would sicken of it easily.

Being a Kramer game and having a bit of a lineage from Princes of Florence, I was primed to like Colosseum. In the end, I think it was a fine game, one I'd like to play again but probably don't need to own. We played a 4-player game, which I think is the minimum; 5 players might be the best. One of the notable points for me was the uneven tenor of the game play. One moment, we were making jokes and laughing and the next, we were quietly studying charts and tokens to figure out what we needed for future rounds. This wasn't bad - just odd. I don't think I've ever quite played a game that went from fun to serious to fun quite so rapidly. I'd like to give Colosseum an 8 but there are a couple things holding me back.

PROS
-We played the Deluxe TMG version: metal coins were a nice touch as were the other components. I know people slag on the art but I like it. Also, the board is much simpler looking than the overwrought original.
-The trading phase was a highlight: bullying and cajoling opponents into making a deal was quite enjoyable. We played the open negotiation variant.
-Putting on the performance and counting up the bonus, while a little mathy, gave a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

CONS
-The auction was a total dud. There were only two auctions where people ended up paying more than the obligatory 8. 
-Maybe this is really only a 5-player game? Certainly no fewer than 4. Having 5 players would make the auctions a bit more interesting but that still might not solve it.
-Turn order might be a sticking point, especially if you're in a position where you don't see the Emperor for the whole game.
-The back of the player aid is hard to read and lacking critical info. I would prefer the old Days of Wonder version with the excel table. It also needs to have the lower values for each performance if you're missing tiles.

RATING: 7
Colosseum is not going to be an evergreen in our rotation, but I did get several enjoyable sessions out of it before moving on.  It's a melting pot of mechanisms that plays something like a lighter, looser Princes of Florence mashed up with Traumfabrik.

Like:
1. The pointed structure of the game, with everything aimed at setting up one glorious final show.
2. The jockeying surrounding the tile that the last place player steals from the leader.
3. There are several viable paths to victory.
4. The wonderful resin pawns, and the overall look of the game.

Don't like:
1. The movement of the pawns is way, way, way too influential on the outcome.  This is the big reason I don't continue to suggest this game.
2. The auction is too loose.  Most lots go for the minimum, and you may or may not luck into what you need.
3. The "intense auctions" aren't a solution, because they wreck the game's central tension, scarcity of tiles.
4. The trading phase can be cumbersome if players aren't able to quickly assess whether there's a viable deal out there (a la Settler of Catan).
5. The game could stand to be a half hour shorter.

The pace of the game feels a little bit like Funkenschlag/Power Grid, where players have to consider the tradeoffs between running out ahead and hanging back.  Frontrunners won't have to worry about cash, and will earn extra laurels (podia and/or season tickets) for their final show.  Trailers will have an easier time getting the tiles they need for their final show, but might need to seek cash in the trading phase.

Colosseum is a game that reminds me very much of Princes of Florence. (Well, they are both by Kramer) The auctions, the putting the pieces together to create a work of art, etc.

However, I like Princes much better. Among other things, I don't like the scoring in Colesseum. It punishes incremental growth, particularly with the podium being a bonus to whoever is already in the lead.

Fun game which is even better with intense auctions (because the money is scarcer). I can't describe why I like it so much, because I think the sum is better than the indivual parts in the game. It is much planning ahead to do the big thing, but meanwhile you have to get decent cash to make that great event. The only problem I have with the game is the free-wheeling tile auctions.

[May 09] [Rating: 9]
I've come to the conclusion that intense auctions aren't a problem solver. Well, it is a problem solver, but at the same time it introduces a new problem to the game, where tokens are becoming less scarse. I can't come up with a good variant myself though. Even then, I really like the game.

Both times I played this we had 5 players. It is a beautiful looking game and I really like the theme of putting on shows and expanding arenas. The only thing that stops this game being a real favourite of mine is that the decisions you make in the game are too involved. Long analyses time is needed to make a best move and that is not good in a multiplayer board game especially when the optimum number of players is high.

The designers needed to cut back the options in some way so as to speed up play. Maybe having a third the number of shows to pick from with 3 copies of each available and halving the number of performer types.

I think this game is only a whisker from being brilliant. Feb 09

I would have rated the game higher, but the trading phase went on forever and kind of ruined the flow of the game and made it drag on too long.

First game was a nice experience. Not great, but quite good. The game was much easier than anticipated.

However we were not happy with a couple of rules. First, we didn't like that several Romans can share a space. We would have preferred the 'Ursuppe' treatment where each pawn must go to an empty space.

Secondly we found the markets were filled up too often. We would prefer to either have fewer markets or fewer tokens in each market, or that they weren't filled until the end of each round. 

Will of course need to play it some more before giving a final verdict.

Interesting game, and the great pieces you expect from Days of Wonder.  Another game in which winning tactics are not immediately obvious... it seems after one play that you really just need to spend the whole game preparing for the fifth and final round, which sounds easier than it is.  It seems similar to Princes of Florence in that you just need to optimize a few complex decisions, but very unlike Princes of Florence, there's a ton of meaningful player interaction.

Colosseum certainly fits well in the Days of Wonder line.  It is not a “heavy-weight”game, but it is still filled with important decisions and strategies.  There is a considerable amount of planning, trading and strategy to employ in order to perform well and present high-valued productions.  There is a progression aspect present, as players must build on previous turns’ actions and productions in order to prepare for their ultimate gala show.  

I am thoroughly enjoying Colosseum, and each of my games has been tense, and filled with important choices and strategic options.  Each game feels different from the previous ones, and the problems presented seem unique.  Colosseum is a fun and solid game.

RATING: 6.5
The game is basically a series of auctions followed by negotiations, but there is some fun and nice tension in trying to fulfill your programs. However, as each player can only win one of the auctioned sets per round, sometimes luck of the draw plays a big role when the market is refilled. A worse problem, though, is the pawns that move via die rolls around a track and may grant some important bonus points or quite useful medals, if they stop inside a player's arena or on marked spaces, respectively. Also, given that only the best round of each player actually scores, the position of the pawns in the final round is too important, as it may be very easy for a player to gain bonuses, and impossible for another. Last but not least, if two players are preparing for the same program, of course one of them will be seriously harmed when the other grabs it. Despite its flaws, this is still a pretty decent game, but the random elements bother me a little for the time and effort it takes to play.

Es un buen juego.

El emperador a veces se peude demorar en llegar a tu coliseo, sobre todo si eres de lso últimos, peor se puede ganar sin necesidad de eso. Es bueno jugarlo de 4 o 5. El factor suerte no afecta mucho.

The production is great, maybe overproduced and even the game itself is fine, BUT there's no reason to put much more luck into this game, by adding the catwalk for the aristocrats. There's enough randomness + trading in this game, to make each game different enough.

The added luck kills the game for me, as it's very determining, since the last round is the only that really counts and the guy who gets the lucky roll will win. Uhm...

My main nits with it are the times when chance totally throws the game to one person or another, but usually the luck balances out over the course of the game.  The "Intense Auction" variant is a must!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
The game has some neat ideas, like the victory points being the best score for single round during the game instead of the sum of all round scores. Also the balancing of performing same spectacles many times versus doing new spectables is fine dynamic.

If the core mechanic would be more interesting than very light auction/trading, this would get significantly higher rating from me.

When choosing a game, Colosseum always sounds meh. But once it's chosen, and I'm playing, I find myself engaged in the game and wondering, "Now why didn't I feel like playing this...?"

Criticisms of the endgame are overstated - there is an endgame, but earlier decisions determine what position a player's in when you get to the final round.

I don't generally like trading or auctioning, but it goes over ok in this game.  The auctions are a bit fiddly.  Love the components, and like the unique scoring where only the last show matters.

RATING: 7
While I expected a more involved game (the game makes too good a job at keeping everyone always in the race), I quite enjoy the experience.  Good theme integration and gorgeous, too.
What makes this an involved family game is that, if you do whatever, without thinking, you'll loose, yet, ultimately, if everyone does just take weighted decisions, luck will decide of the outcome, and the outcome is always close.
The game becomes quite samey after a while, but the engaging theme and the beautiful bits makes of Colosseum a welcome guest to the table once in a while.

Gorgeous looking game, with the usual high quality components we have come to expect from Days of Wonder.  Unfortunately, the lamest DoW game I have seen to date.  The game rules are geared towards rewarding the last place player, by having them steal a token from the leader...  Game Leader auto-bashing?

In the last game I played, I lead the first four (out of five) rounds, only to finish dead last, a good 10 points from 3rd place...  Interestingly, I went out of my way to not finish in first place on one round, but still did...  My friends recall this game by the Janis "show", where I was only able to produce a horse, out of the four tiles needed for the show, yet I still managed to remain in first place.  LOL!

RATING: 7
One play. First impression: very good. I like the auction a lot, and then followed up with a trading phase, I was very pleased. I've never seen a game that had that particular combination of mechanics done so well. I also enjoyed planning ahead to get my big show put together. Dice rolls have their effect, but not so large an effect as to make the game seem totally random. Oh yeah, the presentation is great too. Want to play again.

8 years later, I finally got to play it again. It's still a pretty solid game that I'd like to play more. The new version isn't as pretty, but whatever.

Enjoyable. Lots of nice mechanics. Unfortunately it seems it could do with another turn, there doesn't seem enough time in the game to collect the required pieces to run a big event ticket. Also I feel there is too much benefit to the player who goes last in any turn and if a player is last in the final round then he is at a significant advantage for the game win.

This benefit comes about since he can win any auction for the minimum bid, roll his dice last in that round and apply any additional actions to the spectators last in the round. This is seriously not compensated by the starting positions.

Theme and components... Not a bad game, but I think more one for a social gaming group than anyone 'serious'. It's probably best to roleplay a bit too, as it's more fun to refer to the event assets by their titles than colours or euphamisms. The theme comes through so much more strongly playing it straight. Enjoyable enough.

Great game - very much like the trading aspect.  I'm trying to replace Settlers with this as my "big board" gateway trading game.

Update (2013)
Less enthused about the theme - especially when shows involve lions.  Great production values though.  Overall I feel the trading aspect is a bit too arbitrary since there is no hidden information.  I still prefer Traders of Genoa or Bohnanza as a pure trading game.

You bid on the tiles needed to perform your shows from different lots showing.
If you have the most* of that type of tile in possession, you get a bonus. Usually. (some types do not have a bonus.)
You are free to negotiate with other players for tile/etc trading. Apparently the game we played was incredibly friendly compared to how it normally is haha, but I could imagine it getting quite cutthroat.

Anyway the goal each round is to put on the best show possible a la "contract completion". You get a score based on the value of the show/contract + special people visiting your colosseum + any bonuses you have. 
The quotations is around completion because you can be missing a few things needed to perform the show, but you earn less points the more stuff is missing. Also you can re-perform a show previously performed, though it seems to be more advantageous to generally perform a new show each round because there is an accrued benefit to completing new shows.

Whoever wins is the one that performed the SINGLE best show! So score at the end of each round is not a cumulative thing, but something that just tracks what your score was for best performed show up to that point. Interesting as you can't tell for sure who is going to win until the last round is done.

This Days of Wonder game is as fantastically produced as we've come to expect, but it doesn't really really get above average for me. The separate mechanisms (auction/trading/set collecting/roll and move) seem vaguely unconnected and don't really gel into as satisfying a whole as they should. Showmanager/Atlantic Star does the set collection mechanism in about half the playing time.

I felt really constricted in what I could do and weighed down by the (somewhat optional) math.  In each phase, there are many options, but only one or perhaps two that make sense.  Also, it's silly to have an auction phase AND a trading phase. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The basic idea isn't bad. However: Turn order is important, and it's not obvious that the initial setup is balanced. There's a lot of luck in the tile groups that come out, and even more in the dice rolls (that can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by a loge). Early rounds can take a while as people try to decide which show to go for, and if two people aim for the same show then one is going to be disappointed. While there are different strategies, it's not clear to me that one isn't dominant.

This game captured my attention from the first play and continues to be a favorite.  One aspect that is not often considered to be a vital mechanic in the game, besides in trading, is negotiation.  The pawn movement and setup for the last round is essential for higher scores.

Description: Attract senators and put on the best show.

Pro: Neat dynamic of collecting actors/props. Bidding sets a fair market price for tile groups. Each show can only be put on once, so players compete for shows. Neat theme, and great components. Movements of senators provides a great mechanic for player interaction.

Con: Limited mechanisms for trade. Would be better with some sort of event cards or special way to break the rules.

This is a fun game to play, with the pageantry theme coming through great via the lovely components, but to play well you have to really work at the future planning and math of it all.

Colosseum features a box-full of good quality components and a theme that, while rich, comes straight from the Mel Brookes school of history. I await the 2nd edition rethemed so that players are pizza parlour proprietors trying to dazzle their diners and visiting VIPs (local mafia boss, 2 film stars, and - why not? - 3 senators) with their cooks' current concoctions. The structure and mechanics of the game bear a debt to Kramer's earlier Princes of Florence, but the result is more like a souped-up Pontiac than a Ferrari FXX. Surely both an auction and subsequent trading for the 'Event asset tokens' is one phase too many. I also have concerns about the role of money; it features prominently and yet seems to have relatively little effect on the overall game. Perhaps the game authors intended money to change hands during the trading phase, but that has barely happened each time I've played the game. Other minor issues that can, at times, marr the game include the various random elements (particularly the use of dice) and the potential for king-making. Colosseum is certainly interesting enough for at least a few outings, but is unsatisfying as a game and so probably lacks long-term play value.

I really enjoy Days of Wonder games and the work they put into the bits for the game.  This game is beautiful!  Bits alone will not make me buy a game and fortunately this one has a game I really enjoy.  This is an auction game where you are putting on plays in ancient Rome.  I wouldn't think that I would enjoy this game as much as I did, but it is already planned as the next game I want to buy.  

In order to keep the speed of the game going, we play the variant where all the trading is done at once instead of one player at a time.  It keeps the game moving and the same trades would have been achieved anyways.

The was a real disappointment for me.  I found it long and some of the longest segments were just uniteresting.  The trading was unecessary with the "intense auction" variant, but still time consuming with so many chips to consider.  It has the feel of Princes of Florence, in that you are trying to build on your pre-existing infrastructure to rise to ever greater heights.  But in PoF, the points are cumulative.  Here it is the last round, and only the last round that matters.  The little increments that can make the difference between winning or losing in the last round are rather arbitrary, and not exactly subject to your control -- just where on the board are those Senators come turn 5?  Downtime is an important negative, and the whole experience can be had elsewhere and better.  This is one for feeding to the lions.

In theory seems like quite ok game, but definitely doesn't appeal to me..  I have no fun playing it, this is just not my cup of tea.

Besides, it seems like it has way too much of randomness - e.g. a winner can be determined by movement of nobles in 1-2 final turns (and this movement is quite random).  This and other random elements make you not to have satisfactory control over the game..

RATING: 6
Auctions:trading/negotiating:set collection:roll & move

initial rating one play 5 players

I liked the overall feel of the game, a little like Princes but it felt even more like Traumfabrik in the auctioning and how the shows worked while the trading was a little reminiscent of Chinatown. Comparisons aside I do think the game stands well on its own and has a unique enough feel to it with some added elements. 

Turn order seemed a little too important and while it rotated, you can still be significantly burned by it if your coveted work gets snapped up before your turn comes around, same goes for the trading if you stick to the turn order method. This turn order method of trading/negotiating while fairly controlled bogs down and lengthens the game significantly as everyone waits for the current person to finish bartering. A possible alternative to this is to go all out all at once Chinatown style, probably more fun and faster but also much more chaotic, will have to try this and post results.

Forward planning is very much awarded and a gamelong plan is not only possible but necessary for the win ala POF.  While I don't usually like non-cumulative scoring (ie Tempus/Bison) I think it works well here with only 5 rounds and everything you do still having an impact on your endgame if you planned well. The Kramer variant allowing you to participate in more than one auction while lengthening the game a little adds to the game and the strategy I think as well so worth playing IMO. The chart for the events seems a little too busy with all those goods on there and it can be hard to pick one but this would get easier I'm sure with more play so just a minor nitpick there.  
  
The game actual still progresses along nicely aside from the points above until the end comes, I had issues there. There is the potential for kingmaking due to all the open information (could be tweaked by keeping the works hidden?) and while I didn't mind the dice/luck during the game to try and hit the bonuses it can decide a winner at the very end of an otherwise strategic game (could be removed for last round?), fine for a one hour game usually but for 2 to 2.5 hours it ends up being a little anti-climatic. Seems to have pretty decent replay and talk about a TON of bits included in the game. 

In the end I think it has a little too much luck/randomness for a 'gamers game' and is a little too gamey for family folk, this leaves it coming in as a long (maybe too long for a middleweight) somewhat fun middleweight which isn't totally bad but maybe not as appealing as it could have been had it focused on a clearer path. Could be 7.5 with tweaks and 6 or much lower without and might be better and of course shorter with less players (4 best?)

For a strategic negotiation game with no luck see Mr. Kramer's 'Die Handler'.

This game will feel very familiar to fans of Princes of Florence.  Like in PoF, there is auctioning and you are looking for synergy among the works you try to perform.  What is more random is the movement of the guys on the board.  You want to get them into your stadium before you score, but the dice determine where they end up.  My only complaint is that it takes longer than it really should, and I am not sure why that is the case.

Played the Emperor's Edition which is beautifully produced game. However the gameplay is nothing like the production. Boring and uninspiring. The negotiation killed the game for me.

A very fun and thematic game. Beautiful components as with any days of wonder game. The trading feels a little long and fiddly, but a really excellent game. It's a shame it's OOP. I'd love to see another edition with maybe a couple of slightly tightened up mechanics.

This game is pretty good and I played this one before Princes of Florence. I enjoy both of these. The auction phase can create a bit of player interaction as you're trying to complete your shows and snag bonuses from other players. The biggest problem with this game is that a few poor dice rolls early can really hurt. Usually you can get at least get one emperor's medal a turn as long as you have an emperor's loge.


In this type of games its always important to try to predict what route your opponents are interested in going. This makes it easier during the auction phase to try to pick up valuable asset tokens that others will want/need which can be a handy strategy if you get outbid on a lot you want or your asset tokens simply aren't available for you.

The last game I played I learned to adjust my overall plan when the plan started to go sour. I originally tried to go Glads, Horses, Chariots and ultimately moved to Glads and Boats since noone seemed interested in it. I was also able to luckily trade off my extra horses and chariots since those became two valuable items. That game turned out very well and I ended up with a very high score.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2010)

To be perfectly honest, I played the game almost 5 years ago so I don’t remember much about it. The current rating is based solely on my (low) desire to play it. I remember I thought the game was too long for what it offered, besides it is a Days of Wonders game and I never like those, they make pretty games, but very shallow.

I will give Colosseum another chance to woe me and when I do I will come back and comment on it. I do this because it is a Kramer game and I respect him a lot.

Initial rating, but I was a bit concerned the auction round was a bit stale and in our game there was not a great deal of trading.

My rating is tentative after playing only one game.

The listed time is 60-90 minutes.  This will never happen with our group.  Five bidding rounds each turn combined with five trading rounds extended this game to over three hours in length.  Even with fast play, I doubt that we'd get this down to even 120 minutes of play.

Because of the different points earned for productions, and the fact that scores are NOT cumulative, there is a great possibility for last round 'kingmaking.'

I am going to reserve my final rating until I play a couple of more times, but for now Colosseum only rates a 6.

There's so much to like about this game that I wish I could give it a higher rating. The theme is wonderful and well-integrated into the gameplay and it's simply fun to play. The auction, however, usually lacks tension, and in none of my 3 plays has trading been a significant part of the game. Even with 5 players it seems difficult to find someone who has mutual trading interests, despite the fact that everyone ususally has several tiles that are worthless to them. A friend remarked that he felt the game had too many currencies. The fact that players may hold between them 9 or 10 tiles that they can't use, but still can't arrange worthwhile trades, suggests he may be on to something there. A shame, because so much of the game is nicely designed and scratches many of my most insistent gaming itches. I'd gladly play again, but I'm not sure I'd ever buy it 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good game.  There is a lot of interaction with the other players, mostly in the trading phase.  You must always keep and eye on what the other players are drafting for, but if they are drafting for an event they have not purchased yet this can be tricky.  Fun game, even though it took us 3 1/2 hrs to play our first game.  Mainly because some of the rules leave room for speculation on how they work - for example in the rules you are asked to put the event tiles in numerical order and you can purchase events but you have to purchase a larger event than the one you have just performed.  Our question was do we have to buy them in order starting with the top event, later it became obvious that you can buy any event from the stack as long as it was a higher value of the one you just completed.  I believe our next game will be much quicker, but this game can take a long time because of the trading phase.  We played with the full compliment of players which I believe was the major contributor to the length.  I would like to play this game with 3 or 4, 5 players just makes for too long of a game.

Excellent auction/trading/planning game.  The really interesting aspect is that the winner is whoever scores the most point in a single round, which might not necessarily be the last round.  On the other hand, the last round could be all that matters.  So many possibilities in this game, and the theme is just sweet.

Very cool.  Lots of options, great production value.  However I wish that your path wasn't quite so 'fixed' in terms of event cards after your initial draw.

After playing it a few times it is a bit more flexible than initially seems.  Due to the fact that everyone buys three tiles, there are often 'loose' tiles around that will go cheap and enable you to make subtle differences to your path.

RATING: 7
This game plays too long for only playing five turns.  For the length of play that one gets, I'd like to see 7 to 10 turns come into play; but that wouldn't work either.  This game is a short sprint of a game that takes an hour or so to cross.  I enjoy the game, but the pacing is off.

RATING: 3
A nicely produced game with too many actions that don't mesh well together. 

There were several things that bothered me about the game. The first thing is that there are five rounds in the game and in order to put on one of the larger shows you need to upgrade you arena twice and be able then buy the large show you want. That requires three of your five available buy actions during the game, which means you only have two other buys to make that are not predetermined. Now I am assuming in this case you don't have an extra build action to use. Which leads me to the next issue.

The emperor medallions are very powerful but are primarily gotten through fortunate dice rolling. I've played in games where I've seen players buy a loge first turn and only be able to get one medallion while others in the same game managed to get six medallions. Skillful play? Nope, timely dice rolls. The medallions can give you extra VP, additional buy actions, additional movement, or extra cash. The extra buy actions and VP I've seen to be huge advantages. In the last game we played one guy who managed seven medallions won with an extra buy and 15 additional points to his final show. Now this would be okay to me in a 30-45 minute game but this game plays in the 120 minute range and in that time frame I want less luck to play a part in the final outcome.

The issue I had with the auction phase was that no new tiles came out for auction as long as the active player has not won an auction. Where this is important is that in the five round game you really can't screw around since you'll need certain tiles to put on a decent show. So you're not going to try and jack up a bid on someone if you can't improve your own position with those same tiles. In a way it reminded me a bit of the Power Grid auction which I also have a problem with. It's that the last player can just fall into a great thing and walk away with it at cost which in Colosseum is $8. We had it happen in our last game when I was last player and the new tiles that came up include a pair of jokers. Getting two tiles like that go a long way and I was the only player who could bid on them.  

I could probably go on but those were the big things for me. It's not a game I'll search out to play.

I wanted to play this for so long. I was dissapointed. It's not a bad game, but the way the victory conditions work, you can be last all game and win it on the last turn. In fact that is the best way to play it. Every round the player in last place gets a free card. this allows a plyer who is constantly last to be in a great position to put on the best show on the last turn.

I'm surprised this one left me so flat. I love Traumfabrik and Showmanager. I love many of Kramer's designs. But this game seemed so deterministic. Doesn't give much opportunity to change gears. If someone buys the show you want before you, you're pretty much hosed. And there just wasn't much satisfaction for me in pulling off a show. I can't imagine this has much replay value. Plus, it has a long set up and tear down time because of all the bits.

Nice game, awfully euro mechanics-wise (auctions, set collection) but theme is great and enough novel ideas (moving senators) to keep it interesting.  Non-cumulative scoring is excellent.  Not sure how many actually stategies there are.  Trading phase can be tedious.  Good fun but just goes a little long.  At 60 minutes it would be great but at 90+ minutes it overstays its welcome.  Works best with five players (but goes too long).  Three players does not generate enough tension in the auctions and trading.  It is always fun trash-talking about how awesome your show is ...

I had no intention of learning this game since I was around for the collective BGG sigh of disappointment when it was released. But sometimes it's impolite to turn down a game, and besides, I like the designer, the components are attractive, and I wanted to see just how accurate the "watered down Princes of Florence" claims proved to be.

Initially I nurtured some hope that the game would succeed as a more casual crowd-pleaser as opposed to an intense strategic experience. It proceeded more or less inoffensively, with no clear red flags but no "wow" moments either. And it kept going, for three full hours. Somewhere past the half-way point it hit me that, after the requisite 10 minutes of chart-pondering, the choice of overall strategy could be made fairly early, making the rest of the game an exercise in eeking out little bonuses for yourself and perhaps tripping up other players. Sadly, the mechanics mustered but a frail limp to aid me in that goal. Auction after auction went for minimum bid, sometimes with players lucking into extremely valuable bonus tiles after the other players were 'out.' Trading phases involved a lot of peering and double-checking and half-hearted offers of unwanted junk. Everyone knew what everyone else needed, and everyone seemed able to attain most of it via uncontested auction. Money in the game is plentiful. The only time you might actually examine the budget is if you luck into a tile that gives you an extra buy. If this were to happen to you on turn three, you probably have the game locked up.

I found myself wanting to like Colosseum for the presentation alone, and I'm d*mned if the range of shows you can put on isn't extremely cool, but this game just doesn't seem to work. At all. I'd happily accept an understudy to Princes of Florence, but this one isn't worthy.

Build up your acts by collecting the components of the act. Use components from the current act to build a more complex act. This takes some planning using a table of all the components and acts. You can also make upgrades to your colosseum and move patrons around the board that contains the colosseums to improve scoring.

This game is AWESOME!  It was played with 3 CATAN fans, one boardgame/RPG enthusiast & a reluctant boardgamer for my 1st session.  The result:  SUCCESS!  Everyone loved it!  What made it so much fun was speculating what the produced programs could possibly be like if produced in those Roman ancient times--turning players into MCs of their spectacles as they presented them on the gameboard.  It added a theatrical aspect to the resource management mechanic of the game & it made it so much FUN!  A great game!  A fantastic game!  & it's best with 5 players to truly enjoy every aspect of the game!  Is it possible to expand it?  Yes, but not necessary.  A possible expansion pack should include: new programs, new assets, new arena additions & a new board to accomodate 6-8 players.  If you are a CATAN fan--go buy this game!  NOW!  It's worth every penny.  It's not just a great game, it's a work of art!

Seems quite similar to Princes of Florence.  At heart it is a very simple game with an overwhelming number of pieces.  The theme is completely laughable and unconvincing, but it is adequate.  I'm not a big fan of the dice rolling, but it doesn't affect the game too much.  It also seems like money is a little tight for the auctions to ever get too heated.  For the uninitiated, the player aid listing the combinations of each show would probably just be too much to handle and I could see how the game could drag.  If I could compress this game to a 45 minute play time, I would really enjoy it.  However, any longer than 90 minutes is just too much.  Some friends told me it was a 3 hour game.  There's no way I would play if I knew it was going to take so long.  But if I wanted to play a game like this, I'd turn to Princes of Florence, every time.  PoF does everything this does in a quicker, more competitive and more satisfying way.

A bidding / managing resources game with the usual DOW eye-candy and whole lot of cardboard. Its a little more rule-heavy than other DOW games, but still fairly accessible and fun to play.

There was a little bit of luck with the rolling, but overall the programs are designed such that there isn't much competition between players for resources. With a total of 12 different resources, I never found myself in any direct conflict with another player. Even though there was trading, the game was pretty solitaire and has been likened to PoF by other players.

What did impressed me was actually that you could pursue different strategies in the game and end up with very close scores. In the end, I'll probably own this because of the cool components more than the game itself.

This game is reminiscent of Princes of Florence.  I'm still on the fence about this game.  Both plays (with mostly beginners) took around 2.5 hours which I feel is too long for this game.  Also, there are a couple of mechanisms that doesn't feel right to me:

1.  New tiles are not draw unless the auction initiator wins the auction.  If you are the first player, and what you need is not available, you are pretty much out of luck.  Also, in some instances, you can have many tiles drawn which only one or two players can bid on.  They might luck into a very good draw.  Such swings of luck is very discouraging in a longish game.

2.  It just seems like there is way too much to plan for in the game.  You pretty much want to plan for you biggest show early in the game.  But that is very difficult and induces AP.

I really enjoy this game.  The theme and gameplay are certainly unique.  One of the great things about this game is getting the shows with lions and gladiators and blood and making fun of the guy who is running the foo-foo show with harps, orators, and fountains.  I'm not a big fan of the trade aspect because most players can mostly get what they need to run their show at nearly 100% but it certainly doesn't ruin the game for me.  I think there is a strategy advantage to getting the +3 boxes into your arena quickly if possible.  Those points are hard to overcome.

The game is okay at best. I really wanted to like this one. I love the bits, the board, and the pieces (all pieces should be made like those!) It feels really drawn out, and there's a hugh kingmaker aspect to this one. for the last round I could easily tell I was behind the leader by 2 points, so the guy who I needed 3 points from wouldn't trade with me (4th), nor the 3rd place guy. It's too easy to create the winner in this one. I love the bits, but sadly I won't be playing this one again. BTW it took 3.5 hours as well - far too long for the fun factor.

What a wonderful game! It's exactly what we've come to expect from DoW and more! They captured the theme perfectly.  Very simple to explain to new players yet there is great depth.  Each game is different as you try and figure out a "winning" strategy. Truly a game where the saying "So much to do in so little time" really rings true.

My least favorite Days of Wonder game and one that really sat on the shelf a lot.  There were a few clever things in the game for sure but the presentation just isn't where other Days of Wonder games are at.  Playing best with more players and not supporting 2 at all doesn't help it either.

This is an interesting game with a fantastic theme. But in the end, I just don't think that it works all that well.  The "best single show" scoring is pretty interesting, but a little weird.  And the trading phase is a good idea, but it slows down the game ridiculously, making it way outstay its welcome.  I'm interested in trying out some variants to streamline it a little, but as a core game, I doubt that I'll play it a lot more.

[b]My thoughts[/b]:
Always wanted to play this game because I heard it was long and complicated. My kind of game. Actually I find it simple and maybe long, but not too long with 4, and not so much complex as it just takes a bit to realize your first time playing that what you are doing is going to work out in some way. That's kind of what happened with me, I ended up finding a way to make the pieces I had work and ended up winning--sort of lucky imo. I like the variety of events possible, I bet some people could take advantage of this game and just go for a particular one every time instead of being creative with what they have. The figures moving around the track is not a very strong mechanic, as the emperor did not make it around to more than 2 player's arenas, so that is a definite advantage to the players immediately and subsequently left of the emperor.

Felt very solitaire. Even though there was trading you could easily tell who wouldn't trade what. Auctions didn't feel stressful or cutthroat. People usually won on the first bid.

Collect tiles, only final showing counts.  Roll then decide mechanic.  It hits lots of good spots.  Pretty board and pieces as well, Days of Wonder does a good job as usual.

Rating has gone down on this. Decent overall game with nice bits and a lot of different elements that one would think would result in a good game but after a few plays, it seems to have several issues.

Takes over two hours. Too long for what it is.

The last show is too important. I probably play it one more time and try to get last in the first shows. 
There is some tactical play as well but these can be found in set collection games with cards for a much lower price and that actually offer more decision making in  30 minutes.

The game is beautifully produced by Dow. And now TMG is having a kickstarter. It looks to be another greatly produced game.

I can't recommend it because it takes too long to be an enjoyable family game. You can have 2 games of Ticket to ride instead.

RATING: 7
We had huge expectations for this game, after we heard the whole legend created by the Dice Tower. It's absolutely beautiful and quite original. It also sounds like very interesting. Unfortunately from what we've played it doesn't seem like there's a lot you can do, little place to outplay your opponents. You start with some random tiles and is seems obvious which performances are in your reach. Than you can have more or less luck with drawing tiles in auction phase after someone wins an auction. And then those dice rolls which are kind of interesting, but again random. You can make better and worse decisions here, but from our group's experience they are really too obvious. Maybe we don't get something here. It's a good game but looks like more is going on than actually is. You are tied to your fate here and can't really control it other than by loosing tones of resources which won't help you win either.

In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators. Players earn wealth and glory for each event run, using it to create ever more ambitious events. They will need to improve their arena, find the best performers, lure the Emperor and his nobles, and manage assets for long-term success to be granted the title of Grand Impresario, with tales of your extraordinary spectacles acclaimed throughout the empire.

Played 3 times. Sooooo much better than expected, considering I really dislike Princes of Florence.  Still, I didn't really enjoy the game that much.  I really hate the randomness of the opening shows & tiles.  If you get a fairly awful mix, with no tiles in your opening shows, you're in for some early suffering.  It's probably possible to fight out of that hole, but probably only if your opponents make mistakes.  I think I'll pass on this for a while.

Ok, summary opinion after just 1 play.  Could be so much better with less randomness.  

Your starting tiles, whether you get a +4 bonus for a 3 set, how they match your starting shows, what you roll on the dice(s) and how many medals that nets you all have a significant impact on how you will fare in a given game.

The mechanics are fine but skill & strategy is only part of it and there's actually the reverse of rubber banding.  The 1st player to get the +3 token will get 15g out of it over the game and a better shot at other +3 tokens which in turn give you more money and better shot at more tokens and final win.

The actual rubber banding (last stealing from 1st), although sorely needed, feels tacked on and is very disrupting to the planning of the 1st player.

If everyone play optimally, I feel that the only thing really preventing me to calling out a winner before 1st turn is the dice rolls.  Another way you could act on the play is to deny trades and/or pity trade but that would mean counting everything to know who the next round leader is and is hard to do accurately without slowing the game.

I'd play again for sure, but I have doubts in spite of the game's high ranking.

RATING: 5
It draws comparisons to Traumfabrik, Showmanager and Princes of Florence but is very different on it's own.  There's lots of planning for which shows to create and deliberating of which tiles to gain.  There's a fair amount of luck in setup/start.  I wish the auctions or lot refreshments weren't so limiting on the "start player".  Acquiring medals is mostly a random roll of dice (and there is importance towards getting them).  Also, the high randomness of how the pawns (Emperor, Consuls & Senators) move definitely creates a significant "random impact" on the endgame results, especially for the very last show performed.  I think this has the potential of being a much better strategy game if the randomness is mitigated more and if the auctions were less limiting with more player control.  The artwork and production quality is fantastic (as you would expect from a Days of Wonder game) and the theme and bits are very pretty.  I am interested in playing the designer's variant(s) to see if that helps improve my taste for the game.

RATING: 4
Dude, just play Princes of Florence instead!  PoF is a much better game!  Played with AP prone players, this can be a bit painful if they aren't thinking ahead during other people's turns.  Otherwise, its a mishmash of mechanics in which you seek to put together the best show possible to draw the most spectators.  You have 5 turns to figure out how best to put on the best show which is the only thing that matters in the end.  It's relatively easy to instruct, but may appear daunting at first glimpse with the number of pieces in the game.  The dice rolling for moving the nobles and such, while an interesting effort, really can determine the game and that random element will turn people off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My rating for this game is really quite strange in of itself. This is rated a 6 solely based on one mechanic in the game, the trading phase. I thoroughly enjoyed bartering my way to victory my first game of this, and found that every turn all I was doing was looking forward to when I could trade with the other players. The rest was really window dressing to me, so that i could trade again the next turn. Sure, I was trying to put on the biggest show, but what i will always remember about this game is how I ended up in a tie with another player at the end of the game after I got her to trade me her Emperor's favor, and all of her money just for two tiles. The theme is kind of pasted on, and honestly this is a big complaint of mine about the game. Putting on shows in Roman Colesseums should be exciting affairs, not min maxing your way to VPs with little tiles.

Some have complained that about this game simply recycles mechanisms from other Euros. There is some truth to the complaint but it does not inhibit my enjoyment of the game at all.  The game has set collection, auctions, and resource management aspects that will seem very familiar.  It also includes a roll and move element that's not typical of most Euros.  The mixture works well for me however and seems to offer tension and opportunity for clever play.  The game is over produced and I like the colorful components.

A nice management game, with a nice mix of mechanics: planning (buying contracts), bidding (at the "market"), negotiation (exchanges between players).  However, I did not find anything original.

I did not care for the downtime during bidding (players who got items cannot bid anymore), and during the negotiation phase (it's boring when you have nothing of interest to other players, as in Bohnanza).

Be an impressario in ancient rome. Great resource-matching game: Gather as many of the actors/requisites for the show you want to perform, and awe the spectators with your grand displays. Enlargen your theatre in order to attract influential officials as patrons, for further prestige.

Another game where it is important to stay off 1st place until the last turn or two, as the last place gets to steal a ressource from you after the shows have been performed. Interestingly, it is only your single best show that counts, making it possible to win the game with an earlier performance..

I somehow haven't mastered the art of collecting diverse enough ressources, which normally leaves me with a one- or two-trick pony show for last (but still winning!)

I didn't see that coming in the rules. The random element of the game seems to dominate it. Especially the initial draw can virtually kill a player. No wonder, since there's even a rule that favors the leader (podia anone?). I played this game with three people and I think the problem might exist with that number of people only...
The game is much better with 5 players but sheer bad luck can still almost totally eliminate a player which happened to me only recently. It's simply not worth more than a 6...

This is my new favorite. I love all the options for play and how the game progresses as you become a more successful impresario. We start the game with the round counter above round "one" to lengthen the game and let us have a little more time to hoard riches and fame. LOVE it! It's a really fun way to spend some time. I'm going to buy a laurel wreath headpiece for the winner to wear for the rest of the gaming session. (life's too short to be boring.) What a great theme!

Fun game, nice decisions to be made, great bits. Too bad the Events do not have a feeling in any way of actually having been produced!! Maybe if each was larger, with a picture of the event in progress... Clumsy system, clumsy overlong rules. Some Problems: The Trade Phase is too open-ended. The Markets can become stale. The rules are too long and clumsy for a DOW game, and incomplete to boot (discard out of the game or into the bag? discard Add Action tile on use? huh?). The Green and Gold tiles are too similar - thank god I am not colorblind! Would have been great had this game had its development cycle completed

A great Game Kit[tm] Game!

Good auction game. Played only one 5-player game. The game was tense and exciting. I think the trading phase can be quite long especially if player argue to get an asset when the other don't want to give it. Should be played with stricker rules to keep the game from dragging.

What is particularly interesting is the winning condition. Even if you lose badly the whole game, if you prepare for the last big show you ca win. It keeps everyone on their toes up to the last turn. 

I would like to try the "advance auction rule". 

Update: Played with 3 and the advance auction rule. The auction didn't seem to be too different. With 3 the game is quicker but less tense. It is easier to get what you want and there is less trading. Medal and having the possibility to make a second investment are especially important since it enables you to make one of the big show.

I see the parallels that people draw to Princes, but those ties are tenuous at best. I would actually liken the gathering of sets of tiles in this game to that of Ra, yet you cash them in to make a "work" like PoF. The individual tiles hold no value themselves though.

There is a good deal of luck in the tiles that come out and when, not to mention the fact that you have the die rolls to move the pieces around the track to gain bonuses and medals.

This game is WAY over produced.

There are more ways to gain points than in almost any other game I've seen.

This will either be a 9 with further plays, or drop to a 7.

The game does a really god job of balancing itself, and even one false move can be recovered from.

I think that like most Wolfgang games that this one will pick up steam with age, and as people play it more they will appreciate it more.

Update: Dropped to a 7 then a 6. The movement of the pawns around the track is awful. 2 players can bounce them between on another, and he who starts with Caesar can win most of the time. There's also little variety in the shows, and even less control in them than at first blush. 15 plays proves this is really a 6. Play Princes of Florence or Leonardo instead.

My rating may be high... influenced by both my personal predilection for the theme, and the fantastic Days of Wonder production values.  Really, just a beautiful game, one that would make anyone mosey over and see what's going on.  I think this sucker is just fun, fun, fun, especially with the right group who will get into announcing their shows with trumpet blasts and stuff.  I believe the issue about program 28 being broken is for real, though.  And while there are a few different paths to victory, my sense is that the games can feel the same in terms of their arc, which given how long it is, ain't great.  I think the simple solution is just not to play it so super often, but bring it out once in a while as a centerpiece.  And either take program 28 out, or make sure people REALLY know how powerful it is.

Fun, if a bit light for my tastes.

Core gameplay of building a colosseum and putting on shows was satisfying.

Trading feels mean when some players get left out because they're not loud enough.

Interesting mechanic that only your best turn's score counts. Led to some odd out-of-theme gameplay where players didn't put on a show in one round because they didn't need to.

One of Days of Wonder's best games.  A great Wolfgang Kramer game that is very much under-rated.  You put on shows in the colosseum by acquiring different tiles.  If you have most of a particular type, and at least 3 of them you can get a bonus.  Also, you can expand your arena to put on bigger and better shows.  The player who puts on the biggest show wins.

Great components and that look great when setup.  

Excellent family game.

Build up the stadium, put on spectacular shows and wow the spectators. Lots of interesting steps in the process of this game and variable strategies to pursue though some choices while not clearly a mistake at first you definitely will learn are not viable strategies at all. Still though there are plenty of good and varied strategies to pursue. Excellent quality in the components as you come to expect from Days of Wonder and it's fun to calculate how popular your show is, especially if you're putting on a show that you previously did and you do better at it the second time around!

I thought I'd quickly get tired of this game but it has managed to keep my interest. Great mix of luck, planning and negotiating... AND it looks great on the table.

8->7.5 This will probably settle at a 7. It's a solid game and enjoyable to play but I think it can go a little long for what you get out of it.

Game seems heavier than Pompeii and definitely more than Thebes.

Excellent comments:http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/583075/have-to-decide-to-open-or-return-this-game

Apparently the game is far simpler than Power Grid and Agricola; while scratching the same itch as PG BUT looking much nicer. More accessible to newbs and BGF but does have the "downside" of being too long for newbs at 1.5 hours (See article on game length: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/569232/average-time-for-a-game-of-colosseum)

LOTS of pieces BUT apparently the game mechanic is VERY intuitive and all the pieces have a purpose, so this does NOT make it overwhelming for newbs. 

Amazon has 9/10 people rating it a five, so it looks like it'll very much appeal to non mainstream gamers.

May have a limited predictable strategy (where you "figure things out") after a few games (and therefore you'll be just going through the motions).

May not be a great gateway game due to: 
-- the layers of play
-- weight = 2.8  
-- stated 90 min game time (can possibly run longer)

Apparently the player aids assist tremendously in teaching newbies the game. And, the gorgeous layout makes the game quite pleasurable to play.

CON: Minimum 3 players

NB: I suspect that there are many more games to play out before this one will become a staple in the game library

11/2013 This game tries to be too much at the same time.  Could have been much better, though this implementation is poor.  All information is open, thus it's way to easy to calculate the value of any trade making it a poor trading game.  And a obvoius game breaking purchase on first turn is necessary to get access to necessary succicient medals.

There's something wrong, that I can't put my finger on, but we keep coming back to it.
The trading is painful, because there just isn't enough stuff to trade with, and therefore the calculations become very tight-assed.
And what's with the names of the plays - why  didn't they choose either latin /or/ english?
I'm not sure that we would play it if it didn't look so good.

Lowered to 6. I think the painful trading kills the fun of it. Maybe if players kept their tokens hidden (in scrabble stands perhaps) it would flow more easily. As it is with full information, it gets way too calculaty.

Game Designer: Wolfgang Kramer (El Grande).  I was very happy to finally get a chance to try this game, I had wanted to try it for years given the theme, the designer, and the fact that it is an auction game.  Beautiful components, and interesting game mechanics (e.g., the scoring method).  My main concerns are two: 1) I saw a runaway leader/snowball problem in the first play and problems with catching up (two of the players were ready to quit already halfway through); and 2) If one wants to win there is a lot of thinking/planning/counting that has to occur.  The runaway leader problem is one of my pet peeves.  It is a medium/heavy to heavy eurogame with a strong analysis/counting component and little to no luck or deception/bluffing.  I call these games the "chess" type games.  It is also fairly long even with experienced players, and I could see it getting even longer if people start to analyze the options/counting/scores.  Competitive and complex.

I like this game but I would like it to be somewhat longer. The auctions are pretty pointless later on when everyone has lot's of gold, maybe it would be better to auction smaller amounts of goods and allow players to participate in more than one auction.

One of my favorite games.  I like to use this game to introduce non-board gamers to what modern board games are really like - as a 'bridge' game. Many people have said that Settlers of Catan was their bridge game (and it in a way was mine too), but I personally don't love Settlers and think Colosseum is a better bridge game.  Why?  Because as I like to say "this game is certainly to be like NO other board game you've ever played."  It's that different, but very fun.  There's a bit of a learning curve at first, but there is enough repetition in the game itself (you go through 5 actions 5 different times; so by stage 3 or 4 players have the hang of it).
The game itself has it's flaws - experienced players have an edge, the bonuses each round skew things too much - esp on the final round, but all in all it's a very fun game that gets people interested in board game geekery!

Rating after 4 plays. Beautiful components. After reading the rules I was reminded of Princes of Forence, but the gameplay feels very different - While PoF feels like exact science at times, Colosseum is a lot more free-wheeling: more random things and the trading phase makes the auctions somewhat less important.
This is very much my kind of game: lots of things to do, forward planning is important but there is enough room to make some adjustments to the plan.
Tough game with 5 players (because there are less resources in your opening 'hand' and because competition for tiles and events is tougher), very pleasant middle-weight game with 3 or 4.

I've had this game on my wishlist for years. I was happy they finally announced a reprint. I've seen many of the 'comparison' videos and I have to say they did an ugly job with the reprint. I'm all about getting immersed in the theme of the game I'm playing, and while the DoW version LOOKED Roman -- the TMG version looks tacky. Yes, I know, the coins are fabulous, but I'd rather have cardboard coins and some art that did not look like a cartoon.

In the end, it's the game play that matters most and the TMG version stayed true to the original. The rules help to reinforce the theme. Colosseum is a very good game and different enough from so many others that it is definitely worth a try.

In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators. Players earn wealth and glory for each event run, using it to create ever more ambitious events. They will need to improve their arena, find the best performers, lure the Emperor and his nobles, and manage assets for long-term success to be granted the title of Grand Impresario.

Beautiful material. Original implementation of a very appealing theme. 

In this game you bid for actors and material for your show. In this way you try to organize an event that attracts as much spectators as possible.
If you plan well your best event will take place during the last (5th) round of the game.
I like the fact that the first 4 rounds are actually a preparation of the last one. 

Great game.

RATING: 7
Big, glossy production and an original and fun game to boot. After one play, I feel that the similarities to Princes of Florence are overexagerrated - a lot of the less enthusiastic responses to the game might stem from playing it like Princes instead of, well, Colosseum.
My enthusiasm was dampened by the open trading, which is bad enough in games with more hidden information. Here, it both drags the game down and offers ripe opportunities for kingmaking and the bad kind of bashing the leader. Even so, I'd gladly play again, but a more stratified trade mechanic would elevate Colosseum to an 8 or even a 9, which is where I'd consider buying it.
Played twice.

I really liked this the first time I played it.  But two things really have hampered it in my mind.

The first is the time to play, which can easily be 2 hours with five players.  And that is simply too much time for the depth of the game.  For the thought involved it feels like it should last as long as (say) Zooloretto or Manila, but it can just drag.

Secondly, I feel like I've played out the strategies.  Subsequent plays have brought little new excitement.

Rating has dropped to a 9. I'm not sure if this was just the game we played last night (incredibly it took nearly 3 hours to play) or if the game has just lost some of it's appeal. I find the Auction stage a bit odd. There is really no incentive trade much once you get what you want or just want to lock out an opponent. 

I need to play this again to see if this game was an anomaly or if it's rating has really dropped for good.

1 play. If you like interaction in your Euros, this game is a great choice.  Like Settlers, you need to trade to do well and making all kinds of side deals adds to the fun.  It has a very free flowing feeling for a euro.  A drawback is that the negotiations can make the game drag a tad long and can lead to a bit of kingmaking.    The game has great bits, is very colorful and thematic.  

Update: sold it because it is in high demand as it is OOP and I didn't see the need to keep it.

I finally got to play a couple games of Colosseum with 3. It's terrific! As great as this game is, I have to say that this is one of the most unforgiving games I've ever played. There's a lot going on, but you shouldn't underestimate the importance of resource tiles! It's sad that you can't really play this with 2, as the trade and auction phases would be almost pointless. Nevertheless, with 3-4, I give this a very high recommendation!

Received a used copy as a gift - Thanks berserkley!

Wish I could get this to the table more. I like being able to evaluate the auction of the goods based on various goals. The trading element seems out of place though.

Have come from way behind to win given the way your final score is the best score you've had any round.

Just couldn't get it to the table any more. Traded for a copy of Navegador Feb 16, 2013

This one is a family and group favorite. The only semi-complex game that my wife will play. The strategy is not overly complex but you really need to plan ahead. It's not very cutthroat and has a nice catch-up mechanic where the leader loses a tile to the last place person. The effect of this can be mitigated with good planning. Overall I am a big fan of this game and it's been in my top 10 for some time now.

The game has some issues (the auctions almost always went for minimum bid until the last round when people bid really high simply because money was worthless at the end; the trading was somewhat limited; the noble movement is a bit swingy, etc), BUT the game was fun to play and the bits are great.

Great game, simpler than Tribune, but still get the same sense of theme.  A different flavour of VP track, with non-cumulative scoring, simply marking the best event staged at the end of each round.  No real benefit in trying to be the leader - lose an extra tile in exchange for an ongoing 3VP bonus.  The game rewards building towards a final push in the 5th and final turn.

Need to be careful to hold on to the bonus tiles until they can be used most efficiently (especially trading in to spike the value of the last event).

Really enjoyed this game - there is a lot to like about it.  My first play was with 5 players and ran for roughly 2.5 hours (rather than 90 mins).  The trading was reminiscent of settlers of catan.

RATING: 6.75
A good game, but you have to be wary of players in last place near the end of the game. They potentially can play "kingmaker" by giving away their assets to other players and upsetting your hard earned awards to deny the leader bonus points.

It is more interactive with your fellow players than PoF because of the trading aspect and the opportunity for backstabbing with movement of the special guests.

Interesting mechanisms akin to medium to heavy euro style games. However it seems like the designers tried to keep the game lighter by limiting it to five rounds. It is possible to get hosed in the auctions. The game is more solvable/has less replay value to me than a game like Caylus or even Age of Empires III. My limited play of this has kept it interesting to me, but I do not plan to purchase it.

RATING: 6
07/20/10 Played 4/5 of a five-player game. I found Colosseum enjoyable, after it was clear what we should be doing. I look forward to playing it again. It has a goodly amount of theme. The production is mostly top notch. Although I did find it a bit annoying later in the game trying to keep track of which programs were still available for purchase. Also, the 90 minutes playing time on the box is a joke. Count on 2.5 hours with five players, depending on how much haggling goes on during trading. The other time consuming item is the study of the back of the player aid, as you try to find the best fit for the tiles you have in the programs left to buy. 
09/11/10 A (whole) five-player game. 09/10/11 Played another five-player game.

Interesting game that takes a bit of learning to play it well. It's a gamers game dressed up as a family game. There is an aweful lot of planning needed to play this optimal. Certainly no need to win each round, rather not. Varying between second or last in the scoring seems best, and then win in the fifth and final round of course, which is all-deciding. I need to play this again.

I was lucky enough to get hold of a Days of Wonder edition of this game. The gameplay is outstanding. It rewards long term planning and good negotiation. Excellent game. Get whatever edition you can find. Yes the old version does have considerable better looks IMO, but you can't go wrong with the TMG reprint either. Great fun.

RATING: 7
I like the idea of this game, but I get very frustrated when actually playing it.  Usually I'm the one who's leading every single round, but then I get beat out at the very end thanks to a lucky die roll by the person who's been stealing tiles from me the entire game.  If it did more to benefit the leading player in earlier rounds, I would enjoy it more.  Having said that, I seem to be the one who suggests it most often.

Colosseum is an essential game that belongs in any gamers collection. The one flaw is that it doesn't play two players. Sure you could find variants online but to get the full flavor you need more players. Other than that, the gameplay is fun and exciting and the choices, though comparatively limited, are interesting and can put players in different positions throughout the game. Managing your actions to put you in the ideal spot each round really make for a great game. Get it if you can.

Like Hollywood Blockbuster, but a little more to it. The goal is to put on shows, and you auction for lots of resources needed to perform the show. Because performers can be reused in your next show, you can strategize around a certain sequence of shows that maximize reuse.

I really enjoyed this one.  Some feel you have to plan the end game from the moment you turn over your initial tiles but I don't play that way although I can see how what you start with will dictate strategies.  The final scores don't really become evident until the very end so there is no run away leader.

Played both with and without the official variant. The variant does make it easier to put on more extravagant productions so if that's your goal then go for it. However the variant does increase the number of auctions and so therefore the length of the game by some margin. I think that the original rules are more cutthroat and require better planning. I think that the variant rules actually make the game less fun.

Buy this, move some shit here, bid on this, snooze a bit.

A more lighthearted and slightly looser reimplementation of the Princes of Florence mechanics: buy things in auctions and sales, and use those things to execute one-time scoring events.

Roman Showmanager with better bits and a cooler attendance mechanism.  This is a game I waited on for quite some time, not sure to take the plunge.  But I am glad I finally did.  DoW does not disappoint with the production value and the game play is fun and full of decisions.  Definately fits a niche.  After a few plays I was close to giving up on it as a perenial kingmaker-type game, but after I saw a few last place players jump to 2nd or 1st in the 5th and final round--I regained hope and fondness for this game!

Good game with great parts.  Takes a LOT longer than 60 mins to play - more like 150 with five players.  My main concern (based I admit on one game) is that the blue and red figures move so slowly that you will most likely only get one shot at using them.  If this coincides with a late and therefore strong event great, but otherwise tough luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderfully produced game from DoW that allows players to take on the role of Event Managers in the mighty Roman Colosseum.

The game is all about putting on events to impress the Emperor and draw the crowd. The players must acquire the planning rights to host an event and then acquire the many components that make the event what it is. 

The game combines auction elements with a series of other euro mechanics like the positioning of the key figures to create a fun but somewhat taxing experience.

I really enjoy this one.

This game is very deep, without adding the overhead of several complex rules. The game requires careful planning from start to finish. It is strategic rather than tactical.

Solid game that deserves the hype. I know a lot of people compare it to Princes of Florence, and I can kind of see that. It gave me a closer vibe to Catan, but either way, if you take the theme out of the equation, Colosseum struggles to find a niche. I can see how this game would be popular around the time it came out, but I found it merely okay. For me, Catan is more tense, and PoF is more crunchy. That leaves Colosseum in the awkward position of being a good design, but probably not something that will stand the test of time. I am happy to play, but see no reason to own.

I hate negotiation game, but it has done its job. Very simple game rule with moderate player interaction due to auction and the need of different items. There's also a sense of progress as you get a higher income every turn as you get more audience. 

One downside is the annoyance of needing to look for other players' plans frequently AND negotiate at the same time. That takes too long and is quite tiring. Another downside is the fact that you can't really stay open as you only have five turns to make purchase at specific time, but different shows require vastly different things.

As a Roman with an arena, build up your arena to attract more spectators and run shows. On your turn, choose one way to expand your arena (build new show, build season's tickets, etc) or buy a new show, bid for resources for your show, roll dice to attract Roman high council members, and produce your show. The trick in this game is that the highest value show overall wins the game, there is no cumulative counting of scores. Game lasts 5 rounds, and the person who produces the highest value show in each round is penalized by having the person in last place take a resource. This is a nice component game, very fun to play and where you have to build up for your final show.

What is the combination of auction and negotiation? It feels as if we can fix the mistakes we did in auction during the negotiation phase. Very strange. Also it is prone to king making as +4 tiles can leave your hand without your control by simple negotiations. 

The game is very one-dimentional. Everyone has to go for particular play at the end. I felt that the second half of the game was solitair despite the fact that there are auctions and negotiations.

The game I played exposed a flaw -- once you've decided on a path, there's no real way to save yourself if that path is taken from you. Really sucked going from having a chance to having no chance because someone took a show away from me, just to take it.

Studying the back of the player aids for the programs that'll give you the most overlap with your amassed tiles makes perfect sense, but boy, is it not fun.  There's also a significant runaway leader element, and a great deal of harm can be dealt to your initial momentum if there's no tile overlap on your first two programs.  Worst of all is the "no refills" rule which takes effect when an auctioneer doesn't win the tiles he initially bid on.  This creates incentive for everyone to just let the auctioneer win the bid, so there will be a bigger menu of stuff to bid on as soon as he/she is out of the bidding process;  a very boring way to conduct auctions.

There's fun to be had, but it's fragile.  There's randomness that creates tension and a need to stay alert, and there's randomness that simply creates large gaps between the players' scores.  Colosseum, I'm sorry to say, has a great deal of the second type and very little of the first.

A poor man's The Princes of Florence, which still helps it rank over virtually every other game. The additions of dice luck and a loose tile draft are the big deficits here, yet they change the nature of the game into something more freewheeling than its classic predecessor.

Nice bits, but I felt the game was too short, and that you start with too much. A bit like starting the game half-way through. I might try starting with just 1 event per player, 15 coins  and extending the game 1 more turn. 

Edit: had more fun on latest game, so increased rating slightly. I now feel the problem is only buying 1 improvement per turn: with 2 expansions and 2 corresponding events, that only leaves 1 more guarenteed expansion. Some players might gain medals or improvement tokens for another, but that is of no use to someone without either.

RATING: 6
Gorgeous production but too much work to make a truly compeling game. I spent most of the game I played staring at the sheet which showed which items I needed to acquire in order to build the one thing I had a decent shot of completing before the game's end. If the players don't trade VERY freely, no one will make much headway unless they get very lucky during the auction rounds. Then there's the dice rolling, which adds a fair bit of luck in that it will probably decide the eventual winner (i.e. whoever gets lucky enough to get three or so pieces in his Colosseum for the 4th or 5th scoring). Again, another game I'd play from time to time but not one I feel I need to own.

Colosseum is SO close to being an excellent game, but it almost feels too short.  The length of play time is right where it should be, but I wish it could manage to squeeze in another round or two of show-making in that span.  Great system, but I'm on the fence as far as if I need to get this.

Based on first play, and that with 5 players: fantastic game.  Love the turn structure and the interactivity of the auction and trading phase.  Rich theme, fantastic production.  Don't overlook the benefit of the emperor's medals!

RATING: 8
No one would guess at first glance the amount of strategic thought required to do well in Colosseum: A player should be thinking about the final show from game start as there is only 5 investment phases, 2 of which are needed to expand your stadium, and 1 to buy that show's ticket. Not to mention assessing the available resources and plotting a course to have the necessary components to put on a good performance. 

Which leads me to Colosseum's 2nd unexpected gameplay feature: Ruthless competition for components in the resource market and their subsequent trading. Because everyone can see what the other players have, and need, even novice players will be very cagey in their trades, never wanting to give another player an advantage.

Do not play with 5 players. The game length gets unwieldy, but most importantly, the 5th player is at a disadvantage due to where his/her colosseum is located: Everyone else has access to a Rest if they expand their stadium in a certain direction, but the 5th player doesn't.

The advent of a long-awaited reprint filled me with worry that my beloved 1st Edition would be outshone by a new version requiring me to repurchase the game. Not so! The Tasty Minstrel reissue is inferior in every single component. What a relief for my wallet!

Set collection game with a tiny bit of trading mixed in.  The theme is one of putting on great shows for the spectators to draw a bigger crowd every round.  In the end whomever puts on the show that brought the most spectators will win the game, and to do this you must cleverly place the influential politicians roaming the board, pick up special abilities that grant you more spectators, and even draw on super stars that will attract even more spectators for your event.  

Event cards are used to give you an idea of what tiles you will need to perform a certain show.  You will trade to try and acquire the tiles needed, but you also will have much bonuses that will increase the spectators coming to your show.

This is an easy game with some decisions that is great fun to break out for non-gamers.

Fun concept, but not a terribly compelling game for me. There's a disconcerting amount of unmitigatable luck involved here, between the initial hand of tiles you're dealt, the initial tickets you're dealt, the specific combinations of tiles that come up, and the rolls of dice to move the Roman senators -- enough luck to sway the outcome of the game. By the end, everyone in the game is going for a different ticket, so the auction component ends up being highly un-interactive, with no one wanting anything anyone else wants, making it an auction of no competing bids. I liked the unusual, high watermark, non-cumulative scoring/payment mechanism. I would play this one again, but would not suggest it.

Wow.  WOW.  WOW, this is a little dark horse of a game, like a mashup of Ra and Princes of Florence in a family-friendly, easy-to-understand, and relatively quick framework.  The senator movement thingy is a little wonky, but if that's the only strike against it -- and I can't think of many -- then dang.

Why this is currently ranked under 200 in the ratings is shocking.  There are far worse ways to spend your time.  Highly recommended.

Pawn positions and seating order in the last round have too much influence on the outcome. It is almost impossible to strategically influence pawn positions - it is chaotic, and that means a huge luck factor. I still like the strategic element of putting together a predetermined collection of tiles by the fifth turn.

The game is really fun and has all these nice mechanics. 
Good, but not great.
Trading needs to happen all at once or the game just goes on for longer than desired

RATING: 7
A fun trading game, especially when you get into announcing your events and naming the performers. The mechanics are a solid mix of bidding and trading with a little bit of luck thrown in. The game requires a tremendous amount of planning and is downright brutal on last-minute plan changes, even when they're necessary. Also, the game is a little too long for the depth of the mechanics. Fun, and I'd like to play it again, but it's not something I'd get people together just to play.

Everyone is trying to put on the best show that they can. You need to auction to buy /hire gladiators, singers, horses, chariots, etc to put your shows on. Colosseum upgrades let you put on bigger shows that bring in more visitors. This game is heavy on planning ahead, since you should be trying to go for future shows that complement the resources you already have. Has a feel of Princes of Florence, but not as tight.

Produce the biggest spectacles for the Roman public, from Gladiator Combat to Horse Races to Plays. Money management and action selection play a role in who will win, so choose carefully. It gets better and better with repeated play and in the gaming groups we frequent Colosseum has become a favorite. If it comes to the table, I will run to reserve my spot to play. A lot going on in this one.

RATING: 6
Auctions, trading, and set collection. Probably not worth playing with three because of the heavy emphasis on auctions and trading.

The event scoring system is very clever, and since the game lasts for only five rounds, you really have to plan ahead. Anyhow, the amount of time wasted on trading and auctions is unbearable. Especially since this is still mainly a set collection game. 

The rulebook is the worst I've seen for a long time; It's full of ambiguities.

RATING: 7
The only real complaint I have with this game is the fact that is it can go too long for what it is.  Two of the regularly occurring phases involve somewhat open-ended player interaction.  There is an auction phase and a trading phase.  If folks plan ahead, know what they want, and what they are willing to give up, the game can move along nicely.  I really love this game.  I think it is absolutely beautiful.  There is a nice balancing mechanism that rewards the leading player with a bonus tile each turn but requires him to give up an asset token to the player in last place.  I've read that some gamers were a little disappointed that the components were not three dimensional.  Sure, that might have been nice.  However, I really like the look of the game as it is.  I believe that this game's reputation has suffered from the fact that it had the unenviable distinction of being the next Days of Wonder game after Battle Lore.  It isn't Battle Lore.  And it isn't Cleopatra and the Society of Architects.  But, it is a beautiful, interesting, fun, well-balanced game that I highly recommend.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting, fun and kinda unique in the scoring. But the whole thing feels like it's trying to rip-off Princes of Florence, and that sort of thing goes down very poorly sometimes. The strategy feels essentially meaningless, because you can't get a good grasp on any potential winner until too late in the final round.

The poor auction phase ruins this game for me, as does the obvious and likely potential for some pretty open collusion at the expense of the other players.

03Aug07-Played 5-player. At least 3 players hadn't played before. That might have had something to do with it, but I thought the game was too long for how random it is, and I'm not one to complain about the randomness of games. Yes, there are lots of choices to make, but your big points are from rolling the dice. For example, I had 9 Emperor's medals which I am told was phenomenal. I was beaten 76 to 93 by Matt who was able to go from way in last place to way in first place on the last turn by getting 4 nobles to his show. The bits are very nice but I was bored for most of the game as others tried to figure out what show to do next. We spent a lot of time looking at the chart. I don't think that will change as people get more familiar with the game. I'd play it again, but very infrequently. I'd rather just play Bohnanza.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]As much as I enjoyed this game my family did not. My original thoughts still hold true, but I ended up trading it away because it was not going to get played. The one thing everyone enjoyed was the trading/wheeling and dealing and once we got [thing=20437][/thing] I unfortunately knew it was all over for Colosseum. This just didn't click with my family and since we try to keep our collection lean it left.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Easy to teach to my family on our weekly game night.
- The theme is awesome and well integrated into the game.
- A great introduction to auctions and trading for a family game.
(We do not trade one at a time, but instead everyone trades at once).
- There is a helpful catch up mechanic for the person in last place that only affects the person in first (which actually adds some extra strategy into the game.
- The scoring: you only score your best round (out of 5).
- The artwork and production quality is top notch.[/i]

A solid effort and one that I like better than Cleopatra etc. Why?  There's more going on, although it's true that your strategy tends to be locked in from round one.  We have not found the trading phase to drag too long, but that's probably because we know to cut off bound-to-be-fruitless trade requests before they take off in the first place.

The components are wonderful. The downside of the biggest score feature is that your result can hinge on the non-appearance of one lousy tile or one that won't get traded to you because you didn't have anything attractive enough in return (or the others have their tiles already). In a 3 player game, with more tiles, the penalty of losing tiles by being in front is somewhat diminished. The ability to move 2 nobles seems overly powerful (earning both medals and points) and therefore the investment decisions aren't as interesting as they might have been. With more players, the pain of someone else targetting the same work as you is overly impactful. All in all, too unbalanced and arbitrary to get a higher rating, but still worthy of an occasional play.

This is a great game and I consider it to be one of the most dashingly beautiful games in my collection. This is production value at its absolute best! Unfortunately this game has a little problem: The last round is often a "victory give away". If several players are running for victory, the winner will be determined by who has the pieces to allow the victory! It's sad but true. I still love the game, but I'd give it an even better rating if it wasn't for this faulty fact! The game is still awesome, amazingly interactive, competitive on every level and I love to bedazzle newcomers to the hobby with this one!

- Rules are top-notch, very nicely illustrated, with important examples and well organized. Easy to learn and easy to explain, but players might need one or two rounds to get started!

I purchased this game on a whim for our gamer group. I felt the theme and game mechanics were similar to other games played in the past.

We ended up playing it twice. The second game was drastically different from the first. Once everyone got a feel for the game and understood the mechanics, the second game got tighter. Trading and acquirement of assets became cutthroat. 

I wouldn't suggest this game as an introduction game to non gamers. As for us, this game will have definite repeat-ability.

12/28/11 - After a year of owning the game, it doesn't get requested for play as much as I would like. I think it is a fine game but I am starting to see a certain trend appear in the game play. Anyone who takes the time to purchase a loge, is more likely to win then those that don't buy it. 
I am not saying this is a guaranteed path to victory, but it is powerful. Using two dice to move two or one pawns into your Colosseum or onto colored squares to draw the medals is just a solid strategy.

The major complaint I get is usually about the bidding stage and trade phase. I have never tried the variants since I usually play it with new players. I would say most people rank it a 6 on the BGG rating.

The game is fine but for those of us that already have a huge stock of games, I fear it just doesn't feel unique enough.

It is one of the so many nice games that would have to be played many times to realy be able to know what the strategies are. Before that, you go along the game with a small blindfold.

Still, the game is fine and the theme remains a little bit present (which is better than what can be said for most complex strategy games).

There's really a lot to try to keep track of in this game, you really need to start planning out your last turn before you take your first.  I'm a fan of long-term planning, so this game clicked for me.  It occupies a strange place though--way too heavy for occasional gamers, but the luck factor (primarily in moving the pawns) may be too high for heavy gamers.

TRY May/08: solid game with lots of apparent choices.  Emperor didn't end up moving very far; I can see player 5 having difficulty getting the extra bonuses.  Loge didn't seem to help much, but that could've just been unlucky dice.  Game ran about 2 hours, so not exactly snappy.  The fixed turn order meant that the later players had first choice at the 11-30 programs, unless the early players were willing to commit to one right away, with limited tile knowledge.

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

I have heard a lot about this game on the geek but it is OOP and I couldn't fork out $100 for it until one lucky day when this game fell literally on my lap from a board game giveaway. This game didn't disappoint me after the first play. Out of all the mechanisms in the game, I like the trading aspect the best. I would love to play again. This game brings a lot of laughter if played with the right group. Game is long even with the house ruled free for all trading phase.

---- Update ----
After 2 plays there are some mechanisms in this game which doesn't gel with me that well. First is the roll and move of nobles (seating matters) and the minute details of the rules that is just too much for us to keep our heads leveled and the playing time is long. Rating 8 --> 7.

Nice game.  Neat scoring mechanic. Less mechanical than it may seem.  We played with five and the winner proved you don't HAVE to put on the big show to win the game.  Instead, he put on a medium show a second time with extra bonuses.  

We love it and it's one of those games that gets to the table when we don't want to learn/teach a new one.

This game is incredibly well-balanced.

To my mind, this is easily the best Days Of Wonder game.  I'm so glad I own this out-of-print game.

I found this game rather frustrating. It was hard to decide what event I should go for, there were too many options. I felt that the movement of the senators around the board was too luck based, and made it hard to plan your strategy. The game is beautiful, but I just didn't enjoy playing it.

Played with 3, was ok.  The auction mechanism does not work very well, at least with 3.  You need to pick a strategy at the start, which is difficult if you are new to the game.  It might get better with more plays, but I have better games to play.

RATING: 7
In this game you control a Colosseum, and try to put on the best event possible across all of the players across all five rounds of the game. Effectively, your score is your best turn. Turns build on each other as you play, and the core piece is collecting the resources you need through bidding and trading. One element that's funny to think about is that you are allowed put on shows with less tiles than the event needs for fewer points. For example, a boat show with no boats, or a lion show with no cages. The magic of this game is also it's flaw. The bids could not go your way, or the players driving the trades might not trade evenly, or with you at all. It's not a bad game, but the idea that a win or loss might not be something you can effect with your own choices and actions keeps this from being a great game.

My somewhat uncharitable review of this one goes like this:

Do you enjoy the game-long strategic planning of an upgrade path?
-> Play Princes of Florence

Do you enjoy the set-collection via auctions of mixed lots?
-> Play Hollywood Blockbuster

Do you enjoy the trading of tiles for mutual benefit?
-> Play Chinatown

Do you enjoy the gamey manipulation of position to gain from the catch-up mechanism?
-> Play Power Grid

Do you enjoy the roll-and-move of the Emperor and Senators?
-> Play Snakes & Ladders

The bits are great. The board is fairly large and you'll need a noticable amount of room around it to organize your tiles and shows. I found the game compelling through the third turn and then things seemed to stagnate for the last two with fairly limited choices.

Good interesting game.  Need to make sure you get the event program you are building towards for the last turn.  The event asset bidding can be vicious.
In a 3-player game, the winner was on 72, I got 71 and the other player lost out when the one event program he needed was bought by another player. So he got revenge by trading enough to help maximise the winner's points.

I like this game although there are some points of criticism I have. The game does not change as you get further into the game and repeating the five steps over and over again is a bit dull at time. Also, and that might have been due to the group I played with, the auctioning and trading was not that exciting and most of the time there was none of either. So, it more or less came down to the inital tile draw and a bit of luck. 

Lovely components though I just do not see more than the sum of its parts.

RATING: 7
this game ought to be a comfortable 8, maybe even an 8.5, but after three plays, I've rated it a 7.  Each game ran awfully long, at around 2.5 hours every time.  Now part of that might be down to th erules explaination necessary each time, though I think that the 60-90 minutes on the box is hopelessly optimistic.

There's lots going on (and although it reminded me a bit of Leonardo, I much prefer Colosseum); you have to prioritise your wants, build up your infrastructure, and plan carefully for the last two turns long before you get there.  Unlike Leonardo, I liked Colloseum a lot.  

I disagree with criticism that I've seen regarding the movement of the nobles - some games they whizz around the board, sometimes they are more static, but it is planning - rather than luck - that should determine your last turn's score.  
Whether there are enough important decisions to sustain most of us for over two hours is another matter.  The game runs such a long time because there is an asset auction phase and an asset trading phase every turn - I can't help but think that with some adjustment to either mechanism, one or other of these two phases could have been done away with entirely, shaving half an hour off the playing time. 

The problem is that there are two separate (and legthy) ways to distribute asset tokens to players - an auction round, then a trading round.  I cannot believe that there wasn't some better mechanism to allow people to get what they want but pay for the privelege (an Alhambra-style draft, for example), which would have taken far less time than the current combination.

It just seemed to me, that Colosseum uses many mechanics (bidding/auction, set collecting, trading, and choice of show tickets) but none of them are implemented very well. Compared to other games that use them, the gameplay for each mechanic is weak. This could all add up to a fun time, but as a game Colosseum seemed not up to par with many other games. It is too fiddly and long for what it is, and has some playtesting flaws (leader could/should sandbag instead of getting stolen from, and the timing of loss of Star Performers is flawed). Recommended only if you're looking for another game to learn and have 3 hours that wouldn't be better spent playing other games you know are very good.

I am very happy I picked this up from Tanga. While this game does have two elements of luck, the dice rolls for movement and the tile pulls for the auctions, I feel that it adds a good tension to the game to see if you are going to get thew tiles that you need.

Man, this game looks great! Played well, liked the (limited) options for each turn and the calculated risk of trying to put on different shows. Although it reminded me of Princes of Florence, I really wonder if it is going to have the staying power? Although I enjoyed my game, I didn't feel like my decisions were pivotal - it seemed to be more luck of the tiles. Perhaps more family orientated than I at first thought?

It's pretty good fun and the theme is excellent.

My favorite aspect of Colosseum is the theme.  It's fun to build a Roman Gladiator show.  I also enjoy the player interaction.  There is player interaction in every phase. Some of it is in the "screw your opponent style" while some of it is in the "share with my opponents to my advantage."   I enjoy the variety of types of interaction.  I also like the way scoring works because not every round has to be a winning round.  You can have a money producing round.

There is a lot of the game that is based on the tiles you draw at the beginning.  I could see it being difficult to play if you got two shows that were entirely mismatched with your initial tile draws.  No one had that problem in the only game I've played, but I could see it being an issue.

Additionally, there is something weird with how the tiles are traded between players and how they are acquired.  It makes Colosseum less fun than I wanted it to be.

The components are really fun!  The detailed Senators, Consuls, and Emperor are neat and add a lot to the gameplay.

(45) I've enjoyed all the games of this that I have played (which I believe is about 5 or 6 now) but something about it is not quite grabbing me.  I think I have a hard time getting into the theme, or maybe that I get frustrated with the traveling people and their impact on the game (not having the emperor nearby when it really counts, etc.).  Even though I've won a majority of the games I played, it all still felt like one giant planning exercise and not that great of a gaming experience.  It's hard to put my finger on it, because I'm sure that criticism could be applied to a lot of the other games I enjoy, but there is something about this one that disconnects for me.  I willing to give it a few more plays and see how it goes though.

Component Quality:
These Days of Wonders games are always top notch. Love the thick boards/chits. The wooden pawns are painted and look fantastic. The box insert holds everything perfectly.

Gameplay:
The theme plays a strong part in Colosseum but doesn't distract from having a really strategically engaging game. It may take one or two games to really get your strategy down but playing with experienced players makes for a very good time.

A solid design, and a bit of a brain-burner. It seems to take people a couple of games to really understand the best way to proceed, and to become familiar with how the mechanics all interact. There is some luck involved, and auctions, and trading, but it all comes together nicely into a challenging game. Days of Wonder did a good job with the production, and the board and bits are good-looking and well-made.

Components are well done and the theme is well developed. It is even fun to play, to some extent. My initial complaint against the game was that the gap between first and last player would always be great. It seemed first player was condemned to finish last during the last round because of all the pieces he would lose. When we instituted a new rule that last player could steal from either first or the game board, we experienced a change in the game. The last became a challenger for last round and the first did not necessarily lose all of his/her tiles.
Therefore, enjoyability has been increased and I would not increase my rating from 6.8 to 7.0.

A good game.  The pieces and board are well constructed with nice artwork.  The English rules have some vague sections so be sure to check the Rules Forum and the FAQ in the Files Section.  I like the bidding and trading.  You need to plan ahead for what to build and when to build it -- while keeping an eye on the competition so "your" show doesn't get bought out from under you.  This is one of those games where a person that has been trailing the whole game can take the lead on the last turn and win -- with a bit of careful planning.

I have only played this once, at the UK Games Expo in 2012 with a library copy (no-one in any of my gaming groups owns this). I knew nothing about the game, and thought it OK, but not great. I remember that I came last by a large margin, after one mistake in the first round. It seemed remarkably unforgiving - I saw no way to come back even remotely. I don't mind a game being unforgiving like that, but I didn't really expect it in this style of game (Days of Wonder, beautiful components and seemingly "family-friendly"). Especially when the game went on for a good 2 hours or so. I've got no real desire to play this again, but at the same time I'd not be unwilling to give it another go if there were no better games on offer

After two plays, I've just decided I don't like the game as it is.  12 currencies is simply too many, leading to more difficulty arriving at "recipes" than I like, entirely too much luck of the draw when the tiles come out, and WAY too much trouble making mutually beneficial trades with other players.  Couple this with, in my opinion, iffy rules regarding the refilling of slots during tile acquisition, and movement of the figures, and it's just a game I want to like more than I do.

I was originally quite excited about this game, but it has little replay value.  After a few plays you can determine what the most valuable play to choose are.

Big (physically).  Various fiddly subsystems, but not too complex.  Trading negotiation is very important, more than I would prefer.  Since you only have five rounds, each decision is very important, and that was hard to fully grok the first time.  Lasted rather longer than I'd like.  Not sure how much I like it; would need to play more than once to have a more certain rating.  First played 2007-10-12.

Colosseum may be imbalanced, it's true. Despite this it is evocative, light-to-medium fun. I always welcome coming back and expanding my arena once again. If you're aiming for a casual good time which requires both luck and skill to win then you won't go wrong here. The board artwork from Days of Wonder helps a good deal with the enjoyment. And if your players are willing to announce their shows with style and vocal dramatics you've got a good time for all!

I was _very_ leary of purchasing this one since I generally find Wolfgang Kramer's games to have interesting well-balanced mechanics that never quite fit with the theme.

This game is an exception to that generalization, and is by far the most enjoyable of all Kramer's games I have played to date.

Yes, the game is a set collection game but it doesn't _feel_ like a set collection game.

The mechanics are well thought out and gameplay moves quickly. 

Perhaps one of the best endorsements is that both times we have played it everyone was left wanting 'just one more turn' because throughout the game it has a feel that you're working toward your goal of putting your show together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
This game has high quality components and a fantastic theme. Who wouldn't like assembling gladiators and beasts and chariots to put on a show in ancient Rome before not only the Senators and Consul but the Emperor himself?

However, two of the mechanisms include trading and auctions, some of my least favorites. Also, you have a lot of things to remember when you score. You have to remember that you get extra points for season tickets, for having a podium, for having one or more star performers, for having the Emperor in the crown and for having medals and more.

A little too much bookkeeping for the players but an overall enjoyable experience.

--July2007-- (After two plays.)  Seems like an appealing Princes-of-Florence-lite feeling game.

Altogether, quite good fun, though I'm still not convinced I'll buy it.

RATING: 5
After a disapointing first play, I come to the conclusion that while this is a fun game to play...  I find it's balance to be lacking.  It seems to me that there is definately one, maybe two ways to go about winning this game.  I enjoyed building up my retinue, and trying to manage a production each turn.  In my opinion the Emporer's medals are so lucky that it hurts game play.  Versatility and power of that kind should be managed much better.  In our game, the Emporer medal mix amoung the four players was:  Winner 7, 2nd place 5, 3rd place 2, and last place 0.  In the last turn the winner was able to cash in 4 or 5 medals for an additional 12-15 points...  which alone beat my score for the first round.   I would play this again, but don't quite look forward to it since I feel that the winning strategy is scripted.
We also played the more than one auction win possible variant which made Emporer medals and your ability to cash them in for $6 each even more versatile.  

in the end I feel that this is the type of game that tries too hard to add randomness and does it in the wrong way...  event / special cards would have been better than the rol and move pieces.

I like this game, but it takes too long to play, and the free trading mechanic has really got to go. I have no idea what I would suggest instead, and I suspect that the designer went through the same problem trying to fix it, but the sad fact is that the game just won't work without that awful mechanic.

Despite a wonderful theme and clever bidding and set-collection mechanisms, this game seems to have a fundamental rigidity brought about by its limited turns. It seems that, after a few games, one realizes which of the investment options MUST be taken in order to viably participate in later rounds. There may be some room for experimentation, but one unnecessary purchase will doom a player.

another game I had to shell out the bucks to buy after it went out of print--after selling my copy in a fit of pique.

Don't understand the game's hold on me here, either. Auction + negotiation is a great start, gorgeous bits even better, but look at that complex development board! How will I ever convince anyone else to play this? Why would I enjoy such a dry looking optimization exercise?

I don't know. I just do enjoy it. In fact, I've never had a bad game of this, which I can't say for many games. I've even played this with some real assholes, and enjoyed myself entirely. Somehow it just works. My best guess: Magic!

An impressive game. I really like the theme and the art work. The unique scoring system makes it possible to bide your time early in the game and race ahead to victory at the end. One problem, though, is that the outcome of the final turn is often known when it starts, which takes away the fun for some of the players. The star performers are usually what determines the winner.

J'ai entendu dire beaucoup de mal de Colosseum dans certains milieux ludiques... Le jeu ne le mérite sans doute pas. Sans avoir évidemment la richesse stratégique d'un [gameid=555], la phase d'échanges rend le jeu très interactif et beaucoup plus fun. Le thème est très bien rendu et le matos tout à fait réussi (même si mon beau-frère a repéré des erreurs de grammaire sur certains textes latins…) Dans la catégorie des intermédiaires entre les jeux familiaux et les « gros jeux », il fonctionne très bien…

L'équilibre et la tension sont bonnes, les enchères fonctionnent bien, avec une petite part de hasard qui vient faire la différence entre un jeu « pour joueurs » et un jeu « familial ». Si les échanges ne trainent pas trop, le jeu garde une bonne fluidité… Par contre, dans le cas contraire, il faut bien admettre que ça peut devenir bien longuet.

I LOVED this game when I first played it.

Sadly, after 5 or 6 plays, I felt like I had 'broken' the game ... meaning that I had a set strategy that really worked and doesn't get beaten except by someone else who is also trying the same strategy.  This makes me sad, because it was a lot of fun.

It has a lot of really interesting mechanics mashed together, and until you break the game, is a lot of fun.

It's a very good auction/action management/trading game. The production is excellent and I would play it certainly more often if I didn't feel that Princes of Florence offer the essence of this game in half the playing time. On the other hand, Colosseum offers more interaction, with trading and moving officials to influence show scoring.

Ranking could improve more with more plays and experimenting with auctions. I enjoy the thin theme. I feel that money should hold a points value at the end to the game. The advanced auctions (intense auctions), opens more strategic options, such as trying to maximise your income, potentially having a token stolen, but using your wealth to win more auctions. I enjoy playing without the trading phase to speed the game up considerably. Other advantages to ditching the trading is that it offsets the higher number of tiles you win using the intense auction variant, speeds the game up, and stops what can sometimes be trade silliness between two players helping each other out just a little too much. Nice bits and pretty board.

After further play the only beef I have with this game is the trading phase has the potential to ruin it. It becomes too easy to put on maximum scoring games as players make big trades to offload all their junk. Anyone caught out without the right "junk" to trade is doomed. So what was the point of all the finely balanced and carefully deliberated auctions? Pity, because I really enjoy it without trading, but I'm not at liberty to just make executive rules decisions for the other players.

RATING: 5
First: Great and overproduced bits. And there are some mechanisms and ideas that I really like. But there are others that seem genuinely broken. For instance, the Emperor is worth the most points of all the nobles. But in a 4-player game, it would be nearly impossible for him to make his way around the track to the 4th player. How is that not broken?! Also seems it would be prone to kingmaking, since everything is trackable. And what's the deal with banging on the "leader" by letting those in the rear take a free tile? He's not really the leader, since it's the final score at the end that counts.  

Would I play again? Maybe. Would I suggest it? Not likely.

This is clearly Princes of Florence without the brutality and with a lot more role-playing fun potential.  A much more socially-oriented game, with all sorts of clever point systems that means that players are less likely to get totally hosed.  I'm not sure if the trading aspect makes up for the randomness of the tiles though.  Rating has gone up with more play - this is a terrific game.

Only got to play this game once, enjoyed it but eventually sold it as it hadn't got to the table a second time.  Would love to try it again with the intense auctions variant, which I'd seen highly recommended on BGG before playing it the first time - but for some reason I missed it in the rulebook, thought it was an unofficial variant, and therefore decided to play with the standard auction rules first. A shame, because the auctions were indeed largely unexciting with the standard rules.

Colosseum -- Played once; five-player.  Some actions have an almost mechanical necessity, making me feel as though I'm not really making a choice -- I think "scripted" might be the term.  However, the auction provided a fun jeopardy.

If it weren't for the Event Programs (too many to track, and too frustrating to lose your choice to another player), I'd want to own this game.  But while I enjoy every other aspect of the game, the Event Programs are my deal-breaker.

[4 plays] My first learning game was very interesting, and it was obvious to me that the long term goal of best production wasn't necessarily a linear progression of 5 productions.

In my second game, against the lesson learned in my first game, I continued to play from the lead. It came down to a very tight finish. Perhaps playing suckhole until the end is truly an equally valid path to victory. Not sure how I feel about that in terms of great game design. It seems like at least in Power Grid you can't lag so terribly far behind and still remain in strong contention.

Anyway, I do think this is a well produced game, has interesting decisions, a negotiation phase that can be dramatic, and more depth than is apparent at first. Barb very much enjoyed the game, and that always pleases me.

Most recent play Aug 2013 with  Michael and Bob.

Probably an amazing game if you are new to Euro games or playing as a family. It looks fantastic and the quality is undeniably excellent.

Since I own both, I would much rather pull PoF off the shelf than this one.

A game about theater-production instead of gladiators fighting in chariots? Was there a backlash to the violence in Memoir '44 or something? It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but I probably wouldn't want to play it very often.

Additional: Taking someone else's theater show can make another player quite upset.  The non-cumulative scoring system means than the final locations of emperor and other pawns can really affect the final score.  The trading aspect is a bit annoying, but it's not nearly as bad as it is in some similar games.

Initial thoughts after first game: This reminds me of a few other games in its aspects. The senators and figures moving around the track remind me a little of Aqua Romana. The crux of this game is trying to make the best of very limited resources and money to get a number of shows put on.
Limited resource games don't do it for me I'm afraid. This is a game I won't mind playing if it's chosen, but I won't be calling for it. It is however, quite a cool theme.

Jó játékötlet, gyönyörű megvalósítás, izgalom, hogy sikerül-e megtervezni a kinézett cirkuszi játékot. Sajnos csak ennyi pozitívumot tudok elmondani a játékról, pedig szerettem volna, ha megtetszik. Nézzük fázisonként a játékot.
Vásárlás: Arénánk bővítése, új játék beszerzése, vezetők pozíciójának nagyobb változtatása vagy VIP páholy vétele. Ez a rész teljesen rendben van, tényleg stratégiai döntés, hogy ezek közül melyik körben mire megy a játékos.
Licitálás hármanként véletlenszerűen feljövő cirkuszi elemekre. Na itt kezdődnek a gondok. Sajnos sokat jelent, hogy milyen hármasok jönnek ki, az pedig, hogy adott körben ki a kezdőjátékos még fontosabb. Pontosabban nem jó kezdőjátékosnak lenni és aki a játék végén lesz az, elég nagy hátrányt kell bekalkulálnia. Valahogy ezt a részt jobban át kellett volna gondolni.
Cserélgetés: Féltem ettől a résztől, nem is megalapozatlanul. Egyrészt ez a rész adott típusú játékosokkal nagyon meghosszabbíthatja a játékot, másrészt az elején még sokat cserélnek általában, a játék végén szinte semmi sem eladható, cserélhető. Nagyon sok fölös lapka bennragadhat, amivel igazából semmit nem lehet kezdeni. Nem eladható, nem beváltható. Ezen is dolgozhattak volna még.
Vezetők mozgatása, játék megrendezése: A legötletesebb rész a legnagyobb szerencsefaktor a játékban sajnos. A városi vezetők körben mozgása és császári kegy, illetve cirkuszi játékokon való részvételük egyrészt a kockadobás, másrészt a többi játékos miatt óriási szerencsefaktor a játékban, ami azonos képességű játékosok esetében simán dönt a játék végeredményéről.
Jó játék lehetett volna a Colosseum, de sajnos nem lett jó. Igazából az utolsó forduló dönt mindenről és az arra legszerencsésebben kijövő megszerzendő lapkák, illetve vezetők helyzete. Nagyon nagy a szerencsefaktor, állítom nagyobb, mint a Stone Age-ben, ami sajnos egy ilyen komolynak tűnő játéknál már bőven sok. Nem csak egy út van a győzelemhez, talán még az újrajátszhatósága sem rossz a játéknak, de sajnos úgy érzem az elsőségről a szerencse dönt.

Even with drafting, auctions, trading and a catch-up mechanism the game still doesn't feel balanced.  If an early leader breaks ahead they will continue to be first and will maintain the lead from both the bonus points gained from being in the lead along with the money earned.  With no friction in money there isn't much stopping the leader.  The die movement of the senators is just way too lucky for my taste.  The favor tiles are just way too powerful not to get them.  If you never roll the die/dice that allow for you to garner favors, you are way behind the curve.  The shopping aspect of this is kind of fun, and trying to meet the requirements can be satisfying, but most of the information essential to make worthwhile decisions isn't revealed so you are often just stabbing at the dark with your "strategy".  I'm going to build this mixture up in hopes that player x doesn't grab it first.  At the end of the game many of the upgrades are crap as people burned through tiles leaving too few to make the big games worthwhile.  This leaves a number of other useless tiles.  I also feel that there aren't enough joker tiles.  Because they are so powerful and because they are fairly rare, the price that one has to pay to get one can be awfully high or for eight, depending on when it was drawn.  

I'm hoping you can't legally trade to get the bonuses to break ties and trade back to the same players in the same trading round.  That almost breaks the bonuses, rather makes them really irritating.

There is just too much luck in this game for the length and required processing.

Purchased Apr 08 @ FLGSI am a push-over for great (colorful and thematic)game bits and this game has them in spades!  Game play is quite a bit of fun, though because of the many different turn phases (especially lengthy auction and trading phases)the game can run quite long (3-3 1/2 hours).  Length of game will perhaps lessen as the players become more familiar with the rules and options. It reminds me of a heavier ancient Roman themed Hollywood Blockbuster.

Es gibt wohl nicht viele Spiele, bei denen die Spieler so verkrampft versuchen, möglichst wenig Punkte zu machen. (zumindest in den ersten vier Runden) Das kann durchaus auch nach hinten losgehen, weil einfach nicht genug Geld da ist, um sich Dinge zu kaufen.

Really, really enjoy this game.  Lots of player interaction between both the trading and the auctions.  Putting on the various shows allows you to plan a strategy, so you've also got a goal on what you're working on.  Dice-rolling to move the pieces (senators, emperor, etc.) around the board for bonus points.

UPDATE: While I do like this one, I have to downgrade it to an 8, as it's a bit long, sometimes the auctions offer little choice, and it's not quite as fluid or interesting as other games.  Nevertheless, it's still one that I enjoy getting to the table.

UPDATE #2: Ok, I've now played this a third time and this game, while quite pretty, has very little contention, nearly no player interactions, and few meaningful decisions despite its generally two-hour play time. I hope this never sees the table again.

RATING: 7
The brief summary: wow, this is fun! But it's not at all what I'd expect from Days of Wonder: the production is, of course, great (cute Romaneeples); but it is a deeper game than most of the others - it feels like Princes of Florence light. It shares many mechanisms with PoF (works = events, similar but different auction, improvement tiles similar to Jester variants) but also has some Settlers-like stuff (trading, dice rolling, largest-army-type thing). Definitely worth trying!

RATING: 6
Reminds me of Leonardo da Vinci with the different combinations required to stage a show vs. making inventions.  Because there are so many different types of cards here, figuring out how to make those work progressively is a brain-burning exercise to say the least, somewhat reminiscent of the gem combination puzzle in Sleuth.  If the game plays in 60-90 minutes it is fun.  In fact, I kept wavering between a six or seven rating.  Beware of playing with slow players, either A/P types or those who will take forever to make trades.  That would make an otherwise enjoyable game unbearable.

RATING: 8
This was a game that looked interesting for quite some time and I had heard a lot of good things about but was never easily available until this year, 2017 when I acquired the reprint from TMG.  This is an auction game where players compete to put on the most popular Colosseum show.

The game is actually reasonably simple as far as rules set.  Each round players will invest in one item (with some exceptions), bid on assets needed for shows, put on shows earning them points and money, and do this across 5 rounds.  Instead of accumulating points the winner at the end is the player who earned the most points during a single round via the show they put on.

Reading the rules, I was initially afraid that there wouldn't be enough surprise factor when it came to the winning point total.  I thought everyone would have their largest show on the final turn and it would be pretty easy to tell at a glance who was the winner.  In my games so far that has not been the case.  I've seen players finish with their largest score not being the final round as well as been surprised at who won at the end.  That was a nice surprise.  Something else I didn't initially grasp was the importance of the investment phase.  I initially thought the most important phase would be the auction but there are so many things needed and you can only acquire one each investment phase that sometimes tough choices need to be made.  Money can also be extremely tight.

I've also found that the game changes drastically based on player count and that there is an awful lot of maneuvering possible when it comes to the auciton phase which offers a lot of choice depth which I really liked.

Aside from the metal coins I'm not sure how pleased I am with the reprint comparing it to the awesome Days of Wonder version.  My biggest criticism/fear is that the game is somewhat solvable.  There doesn't appear to be enough variance and with only 5 turns each game I'm worried that a veteran player would fall into the same strategies making future games dull.  For now though I quite enjoy it.

RATING: 6.5
Despite the fun theme and the seemingly constant praise this game gets, when I finally had a chance to play it I ended up feeling somewhat underwhelmed.  The art and physical production of the game are quite good and there are some clever things going on, but something just seems missing on the "fun factor" end of things, and I'm not sure if I can pinpoint exactly what.  Perhaps it's because I tend not to enjoy auction or trading mechanisms, or the fact that it felt a little fiddly and procedural.  It's certainly a decent enough game that I would play again if asked, but I do think that the rarity of it in the years that it's been out of print has helped to boost its reputation higher than it perhaps deserves.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 5
That Colosseum works as well as it does is because of its central novelty: "high water mark" scoring. Each player has five opportunities to stage a show, and their final score is their best result. Players are both rewarded (tiles that improve the value of future shows) and punished (the lowest-scoring player can steal from the highest) for doing well, so an early lead is not necessarily a positive.

The game's other mechanisms are each so shaky that the not-unplayable combination is almost miraculous. Of players' five guaranteed opportunities to purchase upgrades, at least four are required to be competitive and all that's left is some quibbling over ordering. I haven't tried the "intense auctions" variant but the basic auction is both utterly lacking in tension -- the lack of scarcity means that most lots will go for the base amount -- and a significant source of luck for players later in turn order. The large number of different token types mean that most trades will be two players trading their trash for another's, but also drags out the game if committed traders attempt to wheedle.

And then there's the roll and move: roaming consuls, senators and the emperor are moved each round, granting medals if they stop on specific spaces or bonus points if in a player's colosseum at showtime. Some manipulation is possible but it is just an unnecessary source of swing.

The components are lovely but with the basic rules it's not worth playing at all, let alone at the excessive length it's likely to clock in at. Wouldn't mind giving it another go with an auction variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A lot of fiddly bits -- podiums, season tickets, logues, medals -- which make the game a little random and unnecessarily complicated. Balancing mechanisms seem tacked on. In our game, the winner was determined by a die roll in the last turn! The variety of turn actions is nice though and seems logical, and the components are well done. The number of turns seems a bit short by most euro standards, but it works okay.  I only got to buy two events to put on beyond my two starting ones in 5 turns.  Had to use a fair number of actions expanding my coliseum.

[4 plays]  I like the theme, putting on shows and expanding my colosseum each turn.  The mechanic of determining what show to put on based on what components I have is interesting too.  The scoring is interesting in how your biggest turn determines the winner.  There is just something about this game, the theme and gameplay that always makes me eager to play it. Though I always do enjoy playing this game, it has a few things I do get frustrated with.  Usually turn 5 is the big game winner, there are certain lucky things that can totally setup some players and screw other on this ever so important turn.  Also trading is a main game play factor and mostly I dislike trading mechanics in games.

Boy I WANT to really like a game this pretty.  But Colosseum seems to go on for -far- too long for what it is.  And, honestly, I don't like that you have to decide what you're doing for the entire game after the first or second round.  The game's a bit better if the you make the "trading turns" into a free-for-all timed trading period.  But it just doesn't click well with me.  Plus, I really don't like games where your final score is based entirely on a single play (see Power Grid).  I like feeling like I'm accumulating and building to something.  While it's true your last performance is usually your best, I don't like knowing that I might really hit my best game on the third or fourth turn, and the rest of the game will end up being pointless for me if so.  Maybe there's some hidden magic here I'm missing, but despite how beautiful the game is, it just doesn't do anything for me.

Very enjoyable game. Superb components, theme doesn't feel tacked on. In this game what you feel you lack is time as you only get 5 turns to go from a small production to a maximum sized arena with production to match.

Having played it 3 times once you are on a particular course of tiles you have little chance of changing anything radically, So replayability suffers in my opinion.

Three plays in, and I still haven't managed one under 2 hours (& the 2 hour game was only 3 players).

It's a nice enough game, there's nothing particularly wrong with it (the "luck" issues don't bother me), but the game is just too long for the fun it offers. I can't pinpoint where the downtime is, but I find players' attention wanders too much. I suspect there are only a couple of big decisions (which Events to buy) and other decisions seem "no brainers".

I like a lot about this game, but there are one or two 'shows' that can get blocked easily and it is kinda game breaking for me.

This is very nearly a great game, but doesn't quite work for me.

Update: Okay, there's actually a lot here I don't like. Loges seem overpowered to the point whereby not having one makes the game a little pointless. Why not all just start with one and roll two dice? Why give the illusion of variable strategies if the others don't really work?

Ideally, I'd actually remove the dice and the pawns altogether and probably tweak the way money is generated. I'd rather have more money in the beginning so that bidding is more interesting and less at the end so that everyone doesn't just throw all their money at the final auction. I also dislike the way the tiles are so variable that one random draw of tiles can be worth +/- 50 money to a player. It's also a little disappointing when, with half the game to go, players can see they have no chance of winning. I'm sure that with repeat plays/better play that wouldn't happen but it always feels as much like poor design as poor play when it does happen, especially in such a family orientated/DoW game.

Rating down from 6.8 to 5.

RATING: 5
It was Days of Wonder and so far that has never really steered me wrong, however in this case I was not very enamoured.  

There were many instances of kingmaking in this game IMHO.  Especially when it came to the trading phase where I witnessed plenty of times where it became an arbitrary decision on a players part that would benefit a person, but the next time they would refuse to trade to another.  Also at the end game the difference between first and second place came down to where a THIRD player moved (or did not move) the pawns.

Overall it was a decent game, I have noted about myself however that if there is an auction mechanic I want that to be the BULK of the game and not just a smaller part of it.  I enjoy things like Ra and Modern Art. This case made it feel like the game is getting delayed as people dickered back and forth over items and then I could finally get BACK into the real game.

28-Aug-08: Bought this game last year as part of my Xmas present. Was choosing between this and Princes of Florence and decided that I like DoW's production bits and theme better. However, after playing it once with Mom and Cynthia, it seems fairly dry. The Auction didn't feel challenging, and the Trading was faily minimal. Just don't see any excitement in this game at all. Still, will keep it around and play it one more time to get a better feel of it.

RATING: 2
Initial Impression--Hollywood Blockbuster with way too many added game elements: throw in essentially unlimited trading, roll-and-move, over-complex special action rules, construction, insuperable stop-the-leader mechanics--and you get a kitchen-sink game that plays long and is too busy for fun.

Second Impression--Advanced rules kill the power of the stop-the-leader mechanic. Still, if your first two shows have no commonality, you're screwed. Likewise if you're collecting the same as another player and he gets to the show you want first. The game has essentially no mechanisms for recovering from having tiles incompatible with a show you're stuck with, and weak mechanisms for risk management. The coupling of chariots with horses and ships with gladiators make these pairs far harder to collect, signal your intentions obviously, and have no balancing value--and thus, chariots and ships are worthless for trading: add very, very badly balanced to Coloseum's list of faults. I expect my rating to drop to a 2 after one or two more plays.

I had the pleasure of trying this out last night.  While at first observation the game looks like it might have a learning curve it really doesn't.  You can basically learn the mechanics within the first round, but thats not to say that it doesn't have hidden complexity.  Its dripping in theme, with the right players you can feel like you are a grand director of events in glorious ancient rome. 

Bribery and subtle underhanded mechanics shine through while you try to put forthought into your next performance. Your constantly kept on your toes by the pawns moving around and the favor system.  You must continually think ahead about the events you desire to run and set personal goals if you wish to lead.  All lessons you learn early on.  Another great mechanic is the majority special performers, it made denying your opponents of them fantastic, especially when you don't necessarily need the roles for your events. I loved the rolling of the big pawns, theres interesting thought and dynamic in the Ceasar's favor tiles.  At first glance I thought it would be a lame pawns moving around the board mechanic, turns out theres plenty of planning and strategy with it.  All and all the gameplay is quite enjoyable and I loved the player interaction in this title and look very much forward to playing it again.

Tough to puzzle out exactly why, but Colosseum din't impress as much as I'd hoped. I love auctions, the theme  of putting on spectacles is cool and the bits are great. Days of Wonder puts on a spectacle of its own with its overall production values. Nevertheless, Colosseum fell a bit flat in my initial plays. The game dragged and seemed a bit unpolished. For all the great production values, the mechanics and theme didn't mesh as well as they could. The game seemed a bit fiddly and the chart listing the spectacles and their requirements wasn't organized all that well. The trick seems to be to hold back in the early going and make a big surge toward the end of the game, a flow that detracted from my enjoyment. I'll be playing this again, but at the moment I'm certainly unconvinced this is a game with any kind of staying power.

Very interesting game, but it has a very steep learning curve (the event chart is crazy) and there is plenty of opportunity for analysis paralysis. This is not a game for an occasional play as it takes some familiarity with the event chart to formulate a strategy and proceed. Played once with 5 players.

The elegant auction mechanism of Princes of Florence is buried here under mountains of artifice.  Instead of a simple card deck, this design uses a blizzard of tiles that are much harder to handle.  This is a set collection game that is prettier but not better.

Seemed to have a "rich get richer" problem and possibly a kingmaker problem as well.  By round five the auctions and trading seemed an exercise in going through the motions, I think it could benefit from being only 4 rounds.  Also more ways of directly affecting your opponents would be nice.

I really need to play this one more. I really enjoy the theme and the depth to this one.  It's a weird paradox in that it's both fairly simple and has complexity. I like that. :)

I think the setup/explanation time is part of what keeps it away from our average family game night. But the times we've played it we've really enjoyed it.

My one slight gripe (which may go away as I play it more) is that I feel like it ends too soon...just as I finally feel like I'm getting into a groove the game ends.  I guess that just means I need to figure out a better strategy to come out of the gate faster.

Wolfgang Kramer might just be my favorite designer, but this one left me feeling flat.  The production values were top notch for this Days of Wonder release, but I can't see myself ever wanting to play this instead of Princes of Florence, unless I'd somehow managed to play Princes of Florence so many times that I'd eventually tired of it.  I suppose it's okay for a designer to copy so extensively from one of his own previous designs, but the similarities to Princes were really remarkable.  This of course means that Colosseum isn't a terrible game, given that a mimics a great game so closely, but as a result it's not a worthwhile game, in my view.  It doesn't really add anything, and just takes away things.  The idea of only counting your best show for your score is intriguing, but not something that worked well in practice, in contrast to counting all your shows or works in Princes.  The components were nice, but that's about all I can say on this game's behalf.

This is a hard game to rate.  The experience is going to depend so much on who you are playing with!  Between the auction phase (do play the official variant) and the trading phase there is A LOT of player interaction and the experience can rest on how the group handles it.  This player interaction can also determine the game length to be longer than it should.  Having said all that, I think it's a wonderful Kramer design and with more plays you start to see more and more ways that the design is so good.

A Francie Recommended game! I've played twice and won twice.  Sometimes that makes me like a game less, but this one I think I have embraced it. It's all about the last turn.  Preparing for the best show and being in a reasonable position at the start of the last show to put yourself in first place at the end.  Spend the whole game planning for that last play while staying at an even pace with the pack.  Works for me.  (Real pretty, nice bits). Fun game!

As you might expect from Days of Wonder, this game looks great! It has wonderful bits, colourful artwork and a quality board. The rules are easy enough for families to grasp quickly, which is again to be expected from Days of Wonder. It had a very similar feel for my family to Cleopatra and the Society of Architects. Namely, that there is just a fraction too much going on for the depth of the game.

In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators. Players earn wealth and glory for each event run, using it to create ever more ambitious events. They will need to improve their arena, find the best performers, lure the Emperor and his nobles, and manage assets for long-term success to be granted the title of Grand Impresario.

Played with five and loved it. It was not everybody's cup of tea however. The game is much more "hard core euro" than some players thought after gazing upon its colourful components. "Hardcore", in that the game is quite unforgiving - leaves little room for errors. "Euro" because it can become quite a number cruncher. On the other hand, there definitely is some luck involved. For example, if the player to your right does not build an Emperor's Loge, your chances of bringing a noble to your show each turn are also lowered. But regardless of some criticism: I really loved the dramatic showdown in which it all ended!

When Colosseum came out, it was not exaggerated to say that it was the most underrated DOW game to come out from the big box series. In fact, the game was so underwhelming that Colosseum was part of a "buy 2 get 1" free promo for Christmas where it was "given" away for free if someone purchased another DOW big box game a full price.

Fast forward 10 years, the game is now in such a high demand that it routinely reaches triple digits for sales in BGG Marketplace. Scores and legions of fans claim that this is one of the most underrated gem and hard to find OOP in the DOW stable of games. So, is this game all hype or does it have a place on your shelf?

One of my geekbuddies mentioned that Colosseum plays similar to Princes of Florence. I did not even notice the comparison until it was pointed out. True, there are many similarities between both games, but there are also many distinct differences. But in my mind, this game is inferior to POF in many aspects. But first, let me do the pros. Colosseum is gorgeously produced not unlike other DOW games. That is a given by now. The pieces are solid the the components top notch. The tiles are also beautifully designed. While there are a lot of fiddly bits, the game is quite simple and repetitive in nature. It is very teachable and the rules are easy to digest. Non-gamers appear to embrace the game quite rapidly as well. So this game succeeds in drawing in the casual crowd much more readily than POF.

Now, the minuses: First, Colosseum has a huge luck component not present in POF. That remains my biggest gripe for the game. Moving the nobles around to add more spectators is crucial for the game and it is not wrong to say that many other variables do not contribute as big a swing as nobles do. Sure, the program values and investments also contribute a large part to the spectator count, but these values are more static and can be anticipated to a certain degree. Not so nobles with dice rolls. This dice rolling phase is also an area rife with kingmaking decisions. Even if you don't score, you can push other nobles toward or away from other players. The second gripe comes from the auction mechanism. The original rules have auction phases that are too loose and resulted in non-competitive auctions. Variants have been posted but the original rules should not have made the auction so toothless. There were just too many  choices and players just passed all the time, resulting in auction lots going between 8-10 gold each run. Finally, I found the single path victory to be rather limiting. Only five rounds are played and the options for investing are limited. I felt pressured to expand the arena and purchase programs. These actions will constitute 4/5 of investment options. While you can argue this is part of the game, I felt limited most of the time with my path selection. A large production is likely needed if you want to win the game, so expansion of arena and programs purchases feel like a must to compete. 

So is Colosseum worthwhile? In my mind, if you have POF, then you can pass on Colosseum. It is not nearly as good as POF. However, given DOW's production qualities and general love for all things Kramer, I think the game will see multiple copies sold upon the reprint by TMG, followed slowly by sinking back to oblivion once that craving is satisfied by the vocal few.

Wow. I never thought Days of Wonder and Wolfgang Kramer could go so very wrong. Colosseum is a bloated, monstrosity of a game, with so many elements going off in all directions it flounders in a mess of schizophrenia. Basically, there is too much luck to make this a worthwhile strategic game, but requires too much planning, analysis and negotiation to be a light family game.

...

I started to list them out, but then realized it would take a longer time than I am currently willing to spend to list all of the ways Colosseum offends me. Not the least is that it is such a great looking game with a fun and interesting theme, and tragically fails to deliver.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fantastic game with an awesome theme, and enough bling and quality Games of Wonder cardboard to make it a pleasure to play.  Only three things stop me rating Colosseum a 10: 
Firstly, the inter-player asset trading can be unstructured and dithery.  Without threats of slow players being fed to lions, this phase can drag. Still, if you liked it in Catan, you'll love it in this. Me? Not so much. 
Secondly, the game seems to finish just as your engine is getting lift. One more turn? Hard to say. Given the nature of the scoring mechanism this might penalize truly efficient players by allowing catch up but, my game group house-rules this. 
Lastly, it suffers from a 'rich get richer' problem that is exacerbated by the podium awards to the winner of each round. Still, in the world of colosseum ownership you're only as good as your best performance and, a come-from-behind victory is not out of the question!

One play, looking forward to another.  Reminded me a lot of Princes of Florence in both mechanics and feel.  Like PoF you need to know where you're headed in the game in order to do well, but I'd say it is a bit more forgiving if you don't, plus there's more variety of actions/decisions to take on yout turn so even auction-haters may like it. Took 5 of us, none of whom had played it before, nearly 4 hours to play including punching out the (pretty!) bits, a long while reading the rules, and time spent saying afterwards 'if only I'd done X...'.  We're probably a slow group and we weren't rushing, but still - that's only five game turns!

I liked it... but there are some annoying aspects.  The negotiation phase is a bit tiresome and drags the game a bit.  The roll to move with the nobles is kind of silly and borderline breaks the game with regards to turn order.  Just going last at the right time, with the right roll, could net you 15 points in a game where winning scores could be in the 40's-50's.  

The final nail for me is that it's also a little too much to teach, and punishing to new players.  It's not the type of game I'd play regularly, and it's not suited for occasional plays.  I like it though, and would happily play it if someone asked.

Played once, five player. 

I didn't really care for this one much. There's nothing about it I find terribly offensive -- it just didn't pack enough fun into the two-plus hours we spent playing it. I'll give it another go but I have a couple nagging concerns I just don't see going away:

- 'Optimal' building strategy seems to be dictated by the turn order (not a critical flaw but I would to have at least a couple viable options). And with only 5 rounds, anything less than optimal isn't going to win.

- The potential for king-making seemed high (one ill-advised trade can (and did) cause a major shift among the majority bonuses). 

That said, Colosseum is not without merit. It is attractive, it has a considerable amount of player interaction (one area where it improves upon Princes of Florence which, although I enjoy, is very solitaire-ish), and it was thematically strong -- it felt like you were building towards a climatic showdown of gala events.

Think [gameid=555] where only the last round counts.  Derivative in many ways, but it manages to charm anyway with its bright colors, great components, and difficult decisions.  I enjoyed my one play of it, though I got absolutely crushed.  There are some things that really bother me, such as the shortage of medals that can happen if everyone hoards them for the last round, and the luck dependent way that the senators and consul move around the board, and the lack of incentive for trading.  Still, the skeleton of the game is strong enough to provide a good game.  I have easy access to Princes of Florence and [gameid=15364] already for this genre of game, but if I didn't, I might think of picking this one up for the friendly feel of it.

Fun game, really appeals to those who like building something up and watching it grow, as you progress from a small show with three parts, up to a 20 piece behemoth.

So far in all our games, the winner has been the person whose arena is near the 40 on the scoreboard, both 2 and 4 player games. It seems the Emperor ends up here every time. I'm beginning to think that maybe all six nobles should score the same, instead of 7/5/3.

RATING: 5
{2plays, 3p} This looks like a game that I should like; it's got the PoF-style auctions, and fancy bits and all that jazz but, unfortunately, it doesn't feel satisfactory. I don't find it as tense and the 5 round limit seems to be a bit forced. Also, you really need to have the extra builds to either expand the colosseum or get more spectators. However, to get them, you will either have to get it in the assets or hopefully roll well to land on the multi-coloured spaces.

Rating may go up when playing with more than 3 players though I doubt it.

**Update** 2008/06/02 - {1play, 4players} Still didn't like it. You are basically hobbled by the fact that you need to get that big event; getting extras investments is based on either landing the little pawns on squares or finding them in the assets.

Takes the basic model of Princes of Florence, unnecessarily complicates some parts of the game (set collecting), dumbs down others so that they are less interesting (the auctions, building), and then introduces a strong random element (the pawns) that seems to undermine the strategic aspects of the game (and don't even get me started on the trading, which annoyed me to no end). I don't mind games where you try to set yourself up as best as possible and then see where things fall, but not when they last 3 hours, require this much uninteresting mental effort, and then you see the winner decided by a die roll on the last turn. Acquiesced to playing this a couple times cause it's a favorite in one of my groups, but I'd be hard pressed to sit down to this again for a long time.

In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators. Players earn wealth and glory for each event run, using it to create ever more ambitious events. They will need to improve their arena, find the best performers, lure the Emperor and his nobles, and manage assets for long-term success to be granted the title of Grand Impresario. Colosseum includes: a large game board representing arenas in cities across the Roman Empire where events are produced; 5 arenas; 10 arena expansions; 6 unique painted resin pawns representing the Emperor, Consuls and Senators; 5 Emperor's loges; 10 Season Tickets; 2 Roman dice; 90 Roman coins; 30 Event programs; 152 Event asset tokens; 7 Star Performer Awards; 18 Emperor Medals; 6 Event Summary sheets; 1 Storage bag; and a detailed Rules booklet.

This is a quirky game that seems to offer a lot of choices over the duration of the game.  It's unique also in that you're working toward a "best of" score, instead of a cumulative score in the game.  It's a little weird, and takes a little getting used to as far as how to plan the game, but it provides a different experience from most games.  It seems like it's equally likely for a player to be competitive by using the same attraction over and over again, as it is to go for newer attractions each turn.  Although, it seems like the best strategy is to re-use a smaller attraction while working toward a larger one that's slightly related.  It's intriguing enough for me to want to play it again, with a better idea of how it works.

I had tons of fun the first time I played through this, but repeated plays reveal some serious problems. The worst offender is the catch-up mechanic that lets the player who is behind steal a tile. This rewards players for deliberately putting on awful shows, which is just terrible flavor. Another huge flaw is that money doesn't matter at all, almost, due to a decidedly broken auction system (most of the time auctions will go for the minimum bid).

On the other hand, putting on a massive full show has a certain appeal, and the basic ideas behind the game are solid. I just wish some more work had been put into fixing the broken mechanics.

RATING: 7
Colosseum is a far more family friendly game than it appears at first glance. I remember receiving the game in a BGG trade and glancing quickly through the rules, my impression being that it seemed fairly complex. That feeling was reinforced after sorting through the huge supply of tokens and other cardboard bits, as I took inventory to make sure I wasn't missing anything. As it turns out, I was completely wrong. The game plays so smoothly my 9 year-old not only understood it, he kicked my tail. We even played with the official "gamer" auction variant posted in the Days of Wonder FAQ and the kids had no problem with either the game's rules or its strategies. I'm glad I took a chance on it, because auction games are typically a very hard sell to kids and non-gamers but I've found that Colosseum's awesome theme, colorful components and straight forward game play completely work for the casual crowd.

02-14-12 UPDATE: I recently traded this away after playing it a few more times and then getting a chance to try Princes of Florence. The two games certainly share a common lineage, but Princes of Florence has a ton more decision points and more importantly, more paths to victory. I still think that Colosseum is a pretty good game and that its theme and presentation are both absolutely killer, but my plays of Princes of Florence have been game changers. I enjoyed them immensely and do not foresee ever wanting to go back to the Colosseum, although I will probably miss those bad-ass Senator/Caesar pawns...

Excellent concept, yet another excellent production by Days of Wonder. This game can please almost everyone! It has an auction mechanism, it has trading between players and it has an optimizing feature to please hardcore eurogamers.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed my play of this, but other than the length (as per my remarks littering my game comments), what throws me a bit about this now is the auction mechanism. There's nothing wrong with it at all, I actually love auctions... but I find them difficult to teach, and there are certainly players who for whatever perfectly normal reasons, just don't take to mastering them.

So the game is great for those who get into the auctions, but due to its length, it's not one I'm chasing for my collection any longer. Absolutely stellar, though.

For the money, I prefer the visuals of the original than the reprint :P

I got this game for my parents as a Christmas present, and Allison loves loves loves it, so we play it a few times whenever they come to visit.  I often manage to win, but I just can't get that into it.  I think the big problem is that the trading part of the game just doesn't work that well.  Trades are usually either too easy to pull off or too difficult, seeming to leave little room for clever wheeling and dealing.

One very good thing is that there are multiple paths to victory.  I have won both by putting on several shows, being the leader each round, and also by holding back, stealing tiles, and jumping in front in the last round, Power Grid-style.  That's pretty cool.

Good game  - glossy version of Princes of Florence.  Takes a bit long though.

Or is it a 9? Many elements in game I really enjoy but my enjoyment spoiled a little (not a lot) by the trading element.  Is it even necessary? Of course it looks A1 - it's a Day's of Wonder so what do you expect.  A good/solid family game.

RATING: 7
This one might go up or down a little with subsequent plays.  Very interesting decisions, and lots of color.  I've only played with 3 - it will be interesting to see what happens with 4 or 5.  Might drag a bit or get a bit too chaotic.  On the other hand, there will probably be more competition for arena improvements, and more trading opportunities.

After second play with 5, downgraded to a 7, but only because it lasts longer than it feels like it should last.  I'd definitely play with open trading next time rather than sequential trading.  That would take 15-30 minutes off of the game time.

A 'Princes of Florence' like game from the same author. Yes, it's lighter than its predecessor, but the trading and  pawns (consul/senator/emporor) make up for the increased player interaction. I'm just a bit concerned on the playing time.

Played at BGG Con 2015. Pretty fun game. I won but somewhat randomly because I happened to have desirable stuff to trade away on the last event. Seems that a good strategy is to try and get an early extra investment which can help compound throughout the rest of the game. The only thing I don't completely care for is the somewhat disorganized trading as well as the ability to only buy one auction of tiles.

Going by the title I had always assumed this was a gladiators in the arena game. Wrong! Who knew that the colosseums were used for all kinds of varied shows from horse stunts, historical battle re-enactments, poetry, and of course gladiators versus lions. As impresarios, we are competing with the other arenas to get the attention of both the mob and the senators by putting on the grandest shows. I would say this game is a combination of Lords of Waterdeep for the set collections of arena assets and Drum Roll for the theme, attracting the best crowds and upgrading your venue. Lots of auction and barter--But this game pre-dates both comparisons. Throw in the classic roll and move to add a vintage mechanic for nostalgia.

Colosseum  manages to be lighthearted and fun while offers a lot of subtleties and strategies. Beautiful components, great atmosphere, and fun gameplay makes this game a winner for me. There's a LOT of bits which can be overwhelming, but beginners will catch on relatively easy. A 'strategy' game that can be played in a casual atmosphere. One thing to note - this game caused me to not want to play Prince of Florence - which I know is a different animal altogether, but Colosseum scratch that itch for me.

Not the most complex or deep euro style game, but this game has utterly no negatives.

None.
You do need at least 3 to play. 
The components are great. The gameplay is smooth, fun, and engaging. It is easy to learn, and even though I generally prefer heavier games, I am drawn to the lovely, lively art, and the challenge of making the biggest and best 'show' Julius Augustus Octavius ever saw.

I cannot summarize here. Others have done that better.

This is my idea of an ideal game. 
This game is one of the Must Have in any collection.

Ok, it does have one flaw. It is out of print.

I enjoy this game, but the flaws are starting to annoy me.  Money becomes useless as the game goes on and simply enables the richest player to spend the most money to get the highest-desired resources.  Nobles tend to get bottled up in one corner, allowing a single player to score much higher. It often seems impossible to acquire the correct resources, and no one ever wants to trade because it helps other players win.

Wow. More fun than I would have thought. For a family game, I'm a bit surprised that the luck isn't softened (like it is in Princes of Florence). Nice art and production quality. Nice decisions. But the short 5-turn limit makes everything feel tense. I think the player with the Colosseum directly behind the Emperor is in a tough spot, especially in a 3 or 4 player game, as it's entirely possible (perhaps likely?) that the Emperor will never get that far. And being in the lead is a tough spot - you want to coast and draft, being in 2nd place as often as possible before a big final surge. So if you go first on the first turn AND you're behind the Emperor, you're really in for a tough game. Trading slows things down considerably, almost taking as much time as the rest of the game combined - which is a real drag if you happen to be on the outside looking in at people trading for mutually beneficial items and you're unable to participate. Interesting that only your single best event "counts" for your score, which several players found incredibly confusing. I'm actually surprised at how much I enjoy this.

Pretty fun game that reminded me a lot of Princes of Florence. Limited actions, planning ahead, auctions, limited player interaction. I rate PoF a '10', so it's interesting to see how big an influence small differences can have. The dice mechanic in this game is inspired, but it also adds quite a bit of luck to the game. This could become an '8' in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Admittedly I was pretty intimidated by the sheer number of pieces that came with the game.  Upon closer inspection, I really appreciated how well they were made, the production value for Colosseum was pretty high, with quality items and an awesome board.  The gameplay, on the other hand, I enjoyed but didn't love it.  I found the whole experience to be at least one round too short.  The auction mechanism felt a bit flawed (we played with the advanced rule in which everyone can bid on as many lots as they have the money to), allowing too much actor pieces to be available, and thus affected the trading.

Replayability is also another concern.  Since the number of plays you can perform are limited, I imagine after several sessions one would find himself repeating the same repertoire, and that, I'm afraid, can get stale.  So the judge is still out on this one for now.

Update: As feared Colosseum does become repetitive after a couple of plays.  Strategy is always the same, save up enough actors and the emperor's token for one huge presentation at the end.  I wouldn't be adversed to playing this, but I do think my time would be better spent on other games.

There are a lot of really interesting things going on here.  The game length, however, suffers significantly for each new player involved, and also suffers a large hit during the trading.  I think both problems could be solved by employing timers.  You may want to use a longer timer for the new players, out of fairness, but ultimately, playing through the whole game is what best gives a new player the skills to navigate the Colosseum machine next time.

The dignitaries are an interesting lot, as they provide players some very opportunistic options, but the players must be careful not to let them mound up in front of one player's arena, lest that player get, say, four to six of them to attend a single event near the end of the game.

When my first game (5p) finally ended, I was fairly relieved to move on to another game, but within a few hours, I was already looking forward to trying to bend that Colosseum machine to my will better next time!

All in all, this is a very interesting game, which feels familiar yet fresh; however, the whole affair takes a healthy chunk of time (easily 3-4 hours!).  It doesn't feel like it takes quite that long, but it does still feel a smidgen too long for what transpires.

Unfortunately, I think that the small amount of luck, since it is the spine of the game, makes or breaks your attempt at victory.  Playing excellently does not necessarily get you a victory over someone who played fairly well, but got lucky breaks.

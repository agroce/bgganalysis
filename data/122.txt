RATING: 2
One of the few games I just don't really find that much fun.  I thought I'd enjoy the negiotation aspect, but after trying it twice, the lack of any surprise advantages really turned me off.  My main problem is that you have so little to bargain with--sure, a laurel token or two, a promised vote later--but really that's it.  It doesn't play the way I've expected games to play; the mechanics are simple (some call them elegant), and I didn't find any real thought-provoking interactions going on among the players.  I might give it one more try with five people (I don't remember if I played it with five before, or only four), but it may be a game I'm going to put on my have for trade list.

I'm on the bubble here. I think the Mayfair artwork is less than satisfying in this case. Knizia is one of my favorite designers but maybe it's the strong negotiation element that turns me off. I want card play or some more flavorful elements.

130929 This is a fragile game.  The last few plays have fallen flat.  Maybe it really does require an experienced group.  A ton of potential in the mechanism and I love the streamlined rules...but maybe its too streamlined.

121124 Superfiller negotiation game by Knizia.  I suspect this game gets better as a crowd gets more experienced at it.  Its not as obviously easy to haggle as it would be in Chinatown -- but it doesn't have the luckiness of it, and its a lot shorter.  In general I think I prefer this.

While a typical "Reiner" in my eyes, he manages to pull off a very keen "negotiation-you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours-and-possibly-betray-you" kind of game here. Some of the decision making is tense, and fraught with uncertainty, as you know not what your fellow opponents will do. Plans change like shifting sand, and your strategy from turn to turn may be very different in some parts of the game than in others. All in all, a very enjoyable and tense (and relatively fast) game.

Too vague / abstract. Lacks depth in strategy. Components could do with some upgrading ... to be better looking / more appealing.

The first playing had enough there for me to try it again. The game is well designed with neat incentives, but I felt like our game took a bit too long. Hopefully repeated playings would speed this one up. I will say that if it doesn't get close to I'm the Boss in overall fun, I will be hard pressed to make it a permenant addition to my collection.

Quo Vadis is a 3 to 5 player game of politics and intrigue in Ancient Rome. Each player becomes the head of a powerful Roman family striving to gain as much political power and glory as possible.
Senators of your faction occupy seats on the various committees. To advance, they must make deals and acquire votes from other factions or win Caesar's favor. As your members advance, they gain the laurels of high office and move closer to a seat in the Senate's Inner Sanctum.
How will you guide your family to glory in the Senate? Will you use a charismatic approach or just make sensible deals. Will you honor your long term agreements or are others simply fools who trusted you?

Expected playing time is about 1 - 1.5 hours.

For a lighter, quicker game with meaty negotiations and good tactical depth, this is great. I think the abstract nature of the game reduces the scope of negotiations, which might make some players less inclined to deal, but the right group (probably more experienced players) will dig right in.

RATING: 7
An interesting, virtually pure negotiation game that can play quickly, which is nice.  This game is not fireworks, but instead, a fun way to foster discussions and disagreements between competing players as they jockey for position and advancement.  How much is it worth to you to advance?  That sort of thing.

Reminded me of a mellower "Who's the Boss" which might be a good thing, since that game is quite cutthroat and "in your face"...in a delightful way, ya know.

This game was overwhelmingly okay. I spent most of the one game I played trying to avoid scoring no points. I would understand that if I were being punished for trying to rack up too many laurels early, but that wasn't really how it went. Maybe it's a better game once everyone's played it a few times, but I didn't exactly enjoy it.

There are several ways to move up towards a seat in the Senate without negotiation, but opportunities to do so are quickly shut down, causing an unusual type of stress to build since players would rather not negotiate if they can avoid it. Not a good fit, in my experience, for casual players despite being the audience who would most likely play this. That's unfortunate.
My version has tiny components that tweezers would have a hard time with.

A game where cooperation is King. Very much dependant upon the prevailing ethic of the players but cuddly participants will broker more deals than those who are more more hard nosed and do better as a result. Yes you can be 'nasty' and renege on deals but only if someone was silly enough to trust you with a future promise. Players who buddy up in an exclusive 'I help you if you help me' manner, have a run away advantage and would be hard to beat if they share routes in. 


Random counter selection injects a significant luck factor. A bit too friendly and not enough control for my liking. Intrigue is a much better negotiation game. No inclination to play again...in fact game duly traded.

RATING: 3
Not a bad game, but I felt like I was just...hosed...  every turn.  I don't mind getting hosed, but this game seemed to lack the dimensionality of a good negotiation game, so it was just like...  you could really make this an exercise in holding the other x-2 players hostage until someone decides to break and do what you want.  If you don't mind doing that, you'll probably win.  If you do mind doing that, you'll probably lose.   Which, as a deep personality flaw within myself, it reminds me that I'm not pushy enough to be competitive in certain things, not just in this game, but life in general.  In the end, I end-up crying like a little bitch about how life hands me lemons, and I try to make lemonade instead of bitching endlessly about how I should have gotten some chocolate instead.  :D

Like, Chinatown for instance...  you don't HAVE to deal if you don't want to.  This one, you do...or say uncle and put a piece on the board---hopefully so you can get the game over and play something where you don't hold eachother hostage.

Extremely group-dependent...if you don't have a pool of negotiating-types to choose from, give it a pass.

But if you *do* game with such folk, then this is indeed a lot of fun. Very simple to explain and plays quickly (I often use it as a lunch-hour game, and it works very well).

I definitely like having the laurels closed throughout the game - it provides for much amusement (and opportunities for berating others) when the winner is chosen.

Pure negotiation from Knizia sounds like an interesting idea.  And, Knizia did strip it down to a bare bones game like he can do very well at times.  However, it almost felt too bare bones and I didn't enjoy playing through it.  I'll get rid of it, but I'm glad I tried it.

One play.  This game is a little different from other negotiation games.  Some games can have a tonne of negotiating for really nothing tangible at all (Lifeboats) and others have negotiating for tangible items but with a lot of open-ended "you owe me later but I don't know for what" stuff (Bohnanza).  Either way, such future promises are rarely binding, and then trust comes into the game (which puts me at a disadvantage because as the "gamer" few people trust me to keep a promise or make a deal that is mutually beneficial.)

Quo Vadis is nicely different because you can clearly see where you can help and where you will need help and can then make real, concrete plans to help someone in a particular fashion.  Plus, deals are binding for one full round, which takes out a lot of the "How do I know I can trust you?" aspects and puts everyone on a level playing field.  The negotiation is real, clever, and interesting.

I [u]love[/u] the small package and small price of the Amigo edition.  This purchase makes me very happy.

I thought Quo Vadis was more prone to laughs but after my first play I realized that it's more about pure negotiation, some backstabbing and betrayal.

Maybe the first Knizia which hasn't impressed me.
Looks like a cute negotiation framework - but just
not enough game to justify owning.

One thing to keep in mind is that it's filled with
nothing but little deals - so there's not much opportunity
to REALLY screw someone over. My guess is that people will
tend to play in their own little sections as much as they can,
and work together as that dries up, with little desire
to piss someone off, since you'll want to work with them
again. Right at the end, it would all get cutthroat. But,
this depends a lot on the groups playing it.

Another one of those games that is fun to play once a year or so, but not frequently.  Lots of tension with 5 players, as it's critical to get lots of laurels.

One of Knizia's best. A very nice little deal-making game, with a dual-victory condition (get to the senate AND have the most laurels) that makes who is winning very deceptive and therefore avoids all of the "you're ahead" deal-breakers. Combined with strong incentives to deal, this makes for a very lively game. With Chinatown and Traders of Genoa, my favorite of the deal-making games.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

It is refreshing to play a negotiation game that doesn't take upwards of an hour. Quo Vadis? fills a very nice niche in this way. This is straightforward, no-frills negotiating and it works well.

There's a delightful pacing to the game where early on everyone is happy to help each other along, and then at the halfway point things become a little more thoughtful and a whole lot more confrontational. It's all pretty lovely.

Bleh! Quo Vadis is honestly not much of a game in the traditional sense… Instead it’s a “game” which is basically won by negotiating a lot, but unlike Santiago or other interesting negotiation games, this one fails to deliver any tension at all! It was basically just who could convince the others to help him out. Some might like that, but I certainly didn’t. It’s more than 20 years old – and it shows… 
Also, the VP chips randomly come out and you might be lucky. The only good thing about the game was how the game ends, because if you don’t have a guy in the senate once it is filled up, you cannot win even if you have the most VP (I do like a mechanism like that; the “most corruption cannot win” mechanism in Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is basically the only reason I like that game). Quo Vadis is probably a good game for people who like to wheel and deal, but I’m not really a huge fan of this mechanism in games as the winner can be decided by oral skills.

The small number theory aspects relating to the different advancement tracks and their various distances from targets and sizes of the resulting boxes are delightful.

In 2006, FOX aired a disasterous reality game show called "UNAN1MOUS."  The premise is that the nine contestants sit in a room until they all vote to give away a bunch of money to one of their own.  In practice the show wasn't very interesting at all.  It is believed that FOX included a ringer among the guests whose sole job was to ensure an interesting game in the early going.

As the program became less interesting, the producers threw a few 'twists' at the contestants.  These 'twists' were of varying interest and funniness, but they were a reasonable diversion from the unbelievable bore of watching these contestants vapidly argue about who should win.

Finally, during the thrilling conclusion of 'UNAN1MOUS,' the contestants were told the game was ending.  If the vote was unanimous, the lucky person would walk with the cash.  Otherwise, everyone leaves empty-handed.  They ended up giving the money to some woman whose name I can't remember.  It was so boring.

Quo Vadis? is 'UNAN1MOUS' without the twists that make it at least semi-distracting, with the added negative that you can't even make fun of all the contestants, because this time they're your friends and you actually like them.

Quo Vadis is a pure negotiation game where you have to cut deals in order to get anywhere. The board play allows for some positioning, but most of what you are trying to do here is to convince the other players that you aren't much of a threat, and thus sneak into the senate, and thereafter, to shut other people out while accruing as many laurels as possible.

This game seemed a bit on the dry side when I played it, and while I appreciate the austere simplicity and elegance of the system, I wonder how much life can ever be infused into such a Knizia-esque math equation. I feel there is too much open information in this game for the deals to be particularly compelling...it's all about getting into the senate, and getting as many laurels as possible along the way...someone is going to get into the senate based on (misinformed?) perception and then somehow cut a deal or two with a weaker player to get the win, at least it seems that way. There are some creative ways to force things with piece play, but the real winner is definitely determined by dry negotiation. To make the system work, the game has to play the way that it does, but I just felt that it fit together in an unsatisfying manner...the information is too transparent, the king-making too obvious, and the system does not provide enough variables to make negotiation outcomes uncertain as it does in better implementations of this mechanic like Traders of Genoa. The only saving grace of this game is that it is usually short.

I reserve the right to change this rating because I have only played with 3 people and it isn't very good with 3. However, I saw what I believe is a great game for 4 or 5. Therfore, I have given it a optimistic 6.5. It may even be better.

Ascender hacia el senado no es fácil...en cada turno debes meter nuevos senadores en el tablero o ascender a los que ya tienes. Para ascender debes contar con una mayoría simple de votos y para ello puedes prometer cosas que después puedes cumplir o no...(por desgracia demasiado real)

RATING: 6.6
Quite a strange game. It involves loose negotiation and the game-board has an strange shape.
It already contains some of the typical Knizia's tropes, like the collection of random score chips lying on the board. Interesting although not a master-work. To play only with the right people.

RATING: 6
One play - I found it to be an interesting game. It's purely about negotiation and I think there's a huge advantage to someone who can memorize the vp chips that have been taken. Still, I think it's a very interesting game and one I look forward to exploring some more.

RATING: 6
In the group I learned this game with, people are [i]very[/i] quick to offer their votes in exchange for minimal return - sometimes just the automatic 1 for voting, sometimes for one additional point - on the theory that "I get +1, you get +3, nobody else gets anything" is a win in a 5-player game.

The game certainly works this way, but I suspect it undervalues advancement, and that the playgroup is in a bit of a groupthink situation (similar to the "shipping corn always wins" rut some playgroups hit in Puerto Rico). I played one game with a different playgroup, with an "advancement is very valuable" attitude - and advancing often required the advancer to give away the lion's share of the points they got from advancing. I was pleased to see that the game worked equally well, if not better.

I suspect that the solo tracks exist in case the pendulum swings too far in the other direction - if players value votes so highly that nobody would ever advance out of the larger committees, the solo tracks permit [i]someone[/i] to advance (which provides pressure and probably breaks the committee deadlocks).

I'm not always in the mood for Quo Vadis, and I don't think I'd want to play with the special powers, but it's a lovely little game.

Play: I like the speed, the simplicity, and the deal-making.  I don't have a handle on what a laurel is worth; I basically just try to thrust myself into any deal I can.  It's important to get into the highest chamber early, to free one up to trade votes for laurels. (2+1+3) (6 plays)

Given that this is primarily a diplomatic game, it's surprisingly clean.

That's a good route to take if you want to play these kinds of games and still have friends after.

Interesting enough game, but like many of Knizia's games I found it a bit dry and it will likely have low replayability. The way that the game privileges voting for someone to advance was something that I thought would balance the game, but in actual fact I think it might unbalance it. I was many times voting for people simply because I wanted to be the guy who got the point before the other person did. Blocking, when it does occur, can be unexpected (e.g. in my last game I refused to vote for someone and it was the first and only time in the game that that had happened). Interesting enough and very fast. May try it out a little more to see if it gets any deeper.

This is a really good clean game.  I only rated it a 6 because there can definitely be a problem with trackable information with the right (ei wrong) crowd.  Since this game is political, it degenerates into voting for who will win.  With the right group, I might give it up to an 8.

An odd duck, but really one of the best negoatation games going. A fair balance of a strategic choices, shrewd dealmaking, and charismatic interpersonal manipulating. Deals are enforceable for a single turn, and you must make our action decision before discussing terms and votes. Sometimes you'll find yourself playing two willing voters off against each other, and other times you're courting multiple unwilling voters for their help. 
 
One of the best simple and effective games out there in the genre, and I'd rather play this over Diplomac, Who's the Boss, or dozens of similar titles.

I think that this could be a very good game, but the players need to all be familiar with it and be prepared to deal very aggressively.  It is fairly quick (30-40 min) and allows for clever as well as devious play.  My problem with the game isn't that I don't like it, but I have a hard time getting people to play it.  I think this may be because the people I play with find this game to be more clever than fun.  This is the driest negotiation game I've ever played.  As far as the Mayfair production: the pawns are awesome, but the board is somewhat less attractive than the Amigo version.  The tokens are too thin!  I would have much rather had thicker tokens than the small, useless cloth bag they included for some reason.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game somehow works for me (in spite of its very weak theme), as you have tough decisions on most turns.  The downside for me as there are turns that you basically have no decisions.  If it had action cards or some other additional mechanic I think it would probably rate an 8 or a 9. We played with three and I am guessing it would be better with more.

RATING: N/A
As much as I respect and enjoy many of Reiner Knizia's games, this is one that has massively fallen flat for me. A pure-negotiation in it's truest sense, without any of the usual mechanics that would help drive the negotiation forwards. I've tried a handful of times at the tactics of this game, but it's difficult to get a thorough understanding on how best to play a game like this.

I'd always sooner take Lifeboats, for it's more interesting theme, the wild-factor of Captain cards and the variety introduced by different phases.

Quo Vadis is pure negotiation. If you don't got a way with people when talking to them, you will get your a$$ kicked in this game like I did when I played it.

It's like he promises to do a certain action during his turn. Therefore during your turn you can do something specific to help your own cause in the roman senate. When he doesn't do it, and do something else, when it's your turn, you can't do want you wanted to do in the first place because someone else took the spot on the board you want. Can be very fustrating.

You do different deals(not binding) with other players in order to advance in the roman senate and get laurels. It's a game of position. Rules are simple. Scores are hidden.

Not for everyone. Need a good group of players to enjoy Quo Vadis. I don't plan to play Quo Vadis any time soon.

[1 play] This may be a fine game for what it is, but it's not for me.  This game is really negotiation in its purest form, which I generally don't like because I feel that it rewards skills/qualities that I don't have (i.e., charisma).  A negotiation element is sometimes OK.  There's negotiation in Dune, which is a favorite of mine, but because of the variable powers, you always feel you're bringing something to the table to negotiate with.  Or in Chinatown, which I'm not crazy about but did like more than I thought I would, you're making deals that benefit both sides differently.  I guess what I dislike in Quo Vadis is that everyone is doing the same thing with the same goal.  There's none of the "I need brick, you need sheep" asymmetry of most negotiation/trading games.  And the game is so stripped-down that there's almost nothing to it but negotiation.  
Another thing I disliked here is that this is a game where it can become obvious long before the end that certain people have NO chance to win.  That's pretty un-fun if you are those people, and even if not, it leads to kingmaking, randomness, and other unfun.

Simple but decent negotiation game, with the advantage of being less vicious and more amicable, plus easily playable in well under an hour, and accessible to non-gamers.  Useful quote: "it only shines with five players. With only four, games quickly split into two rival alliances racing up opposite sides of the board. With five, alliances fragment and reform as they should."  

There is some confusion about how long you're obliged to keep your word in a deal, because different editions of the rules state this differently.  Has Mayfair changed the rule for [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/341855]how long you must keep a promise in a deal[/url], from one round to only one turn?  See Knizia's [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6854795#6854795]quote[/url] in that thread - confirming that it is just the current turn, there was a translation error in the first English rules.  This does promote backstabbing, which otherwise doesn't really happen if you are forced to stick to deals for the rest of the round; although players who renege their word will likely face negative long-term consequences (can also try the "handshake" rule, where shaking hands makes an agreement binding).  We play the official (Knizia-approved) Mayfair rule that you only are obliged to keep your word in the current turn (have sometimes played optional rule: must keep word for next round).

Naming the committees may make it more fun, like Committee for Revising Roman Numerals, Committee for Feeding Lions, Committee for Minting Fake Roman Coins, see more suggestions [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2657910#2657910]here[/url].

[Negotiation, Rome] {5P:6} Reiner Knizia does negotiation, and it's nowhere near the complexity of his auction games. In fact, Quo Vadis? might be described as a stark, pure negotiation game. It's a good game to try and gauge your gaming group's affinity for negotiation games before plunging into more complicated fare such as Traders of Genoa. Not bad, but too simple for me. ***UPDATE: Due to be reprinted, and this has me thinking if I want to give it another shot, as an alternative to Intrige which I can't see to snag. Amigo reprint is out, but hasn't found North American distribution apparently.

This game is one that has gotten us closest to fistfights.  You make deals with other players, who are under NO obligation to honor that deal once it is acted upon.  Everyone is usually honorable near the beginning, but once it's close to the end, the screwage begins.  Simple rules, hilarious situations (with the right crowd), and real political clawing-to-the-top.  What is not to love?  Knizia is a genius.

Quo Vadis is a great negotiation game. It is the kind of game that would be very boring if not for the right kind of people to play it. If you are able to get into the negotiation, the promises, the dealings, the backstabbing, etc., you will find QV to be a very engaging game. Knizia truly wins with this one and I'd say it's one of the purer negotiation games available.  And (gasp!) the theme sorta actually works!

This is a concept that would fail in the hands of most lesser designers.  It's a quick negotiation game with the a potentially disastrous combination: no hidden assets and the inability to accomplish anything significant without the help of an opponent.  This is precisely the combination that has ruined other games like Chinatown and Europa 1945-2030.  But Knizia somehow makes it work because of a number of good design choices.  I'll list a few: 

The scope and creativity of possible deals is immense for a game of this weight and length.  The random laurel token that will be flipped after a deal is completed adds some needed uncertainty.  There is good diversification of players' interests as they place themselves in positions of power throughout the board.  The automatic laurel for giving another player your vote encourages cooperation, pushing the game ahead and creating interesting game situations.  The possibility of a quick end to the game lends drama and urgency to the proceedings.  Finally, the dual winning conditions (most laurels AND a guy in the senate) obfuscate player's attempts to analyze the "correct" value of any deal.  Impressively done.

Four plays, all with five. It's a no-frills negotiation game, very simple to explain, but one which requires persuasive skills, chess-type look-ahead, and even a little creativity. However, how much fun you're going to have with it really depends on the group; it's by no means a "party game," but even so if the players are too quiet or unwilling to negotiate I have to figure it will be a rather dreary experience.

A truly elegant negotiation game. In a game of fewer than 5 players, your first goal is to get at least one senator into the inner sanctum. If you don't by game's end, you lose. Full stop.

But, if your senator makes it into the inner sanctum, your victory is determined by the number of laurel points you gain in the meantime. That is the second and ultimate goal.

Laurels are only gained when you get enough votes to move to the next committee, which requires you to convince your fellow players to vote you up—or requires you to invest a number of senators into getting into a committee so you can vote yourself up.

It is in the same vein as Intrigue, but without as much cutthroat behavior. Or rather, the cutthroat actions you can take are more indirect.

Excellent pure negotiation game.

own it, played it once some years ago with 3 or 4 players. I remember that i was disappointed by the game, as we could not get the negotiation stuff running. We were mostly trying majority-based advancement and it turned out to be unfun. Nobody wanted to negotiate, either, as it just seemed "not profitable" and promises for later turns were not binding.

Rating review pending until i play this again (with more players), but i do not see that this will happen too soon.

I don't know why it took so long for me to play this.  From a cursory glance at the game, it seemed like something that would be of interest to me.  But, it also looked like something that would drag into long drawn out deal making discussions.  I did not seem like it would be a game that would fit into the 45-60 minute range.  Even after reading the rules, there was no way this was going to be a quick game.  But, we sat down and played it finally figuring we'd get mired in a long session of deals and double deals.  It didn't!  It went quickly.

This is a bit of a favorite with our group at the moment.  Good with the advanced rules (not including the extra chits, nor the exposed victory points after 4 reach the inner circle; both of these don&#039;t really enhance the game (IMHO), particularly the exposed vp&#039;s makes gang on the leader too likely)

Knizia's Quo Vadis? is suprisingly good. Each player has a bunch of people/pawns who enter the board from the bottom and try to move through different committee rooms until they reach the Senate room at the top of the board. You can move from one room to another only if you get a majority vote of all seats the room has. Every time you get promoted to a higher room you pick up points. There are ways to bypass the vote, but then you also bypass points. The person with the most points wins, but only people who manage to get at least one dude into the senate are allowed to win. There are six spots in the senate, so in a 5 player game someone almost certainly going to get locked out. It's a very simple game with a totally arbitrary theme, but the negotiation is constant and open.

Knizia's take on the negotiating game is more of a haggling game as the simple system sharply limits what's being offered to: how much I get, versus how much you get. Much more mathematical than most games in this genre, but at least there's an incentive to deal on an equal basis as both parties benefit over those uninvolved. Works best with more players and finishes quickly, too quickly if anything, often leaving you wanting to play again.

One of the more intriguing games that I've played . . . perhaps ever.

Part negotiation, part abstract strategy, with a dash of Euro.  Such an odd combo that I'm not sure if it's like a revolutionary creation (e.g., chocolate and peanut butter) or just a bizarre concoction (e.g., horseradish-flavored cake).

Worth another play to figure out.

RATING: 8.1
Apr08: Well I expected to like it, but it actually went over a lot better than I thought.  It provides all sorts of interesting negotiations in a scant 60 minutes with very little rules overhead.  That doesn't make it a simple game though since the scope of deals to be made are very wide.  Heck, there's even multiple variants in the box if you want to spice it up.

If you are at all intrigued by negotiation games, you owe it to yourself to try this one out.

Jul16:

Got it played again for a 3 game set.  It was great.  A bit of grudge play, but that's true of all negotiation games.  I forgot to mention above, but I see no reason to play with the "special" disks.  It does take a special sort of group; it seems almost harshly analytical, but I don't think it really is.  Suffers in theme compared to something like Chinatown, but is a much better game IMHO.

A good negotiation game that plays in under and hour and best for 4-5 players, fewer and there are not enough opportunities to form alliances which is how the game really works.

Rating after one play (and in no hurry to play again)... but am curious if we played correctly as we didn't have any rules (not even the German ones) so was taught by someone who hadn't played in years and hence going by memory.

I'm not good at mostly pure negotiation games like this, why I like trading board games via math trades instead of negotiating direct trades.  As such I sucked at this game.  "I'm the Boss" may be one of the few exceptions that I do like negotiation but it's almost a party game in a way so fun... Quo Vadis wasn't.

Extremely elegant when variants aren't used. I know some have called it dry, but maybe that's why I like it. I have yet to find the ideal way to deal with agreements (Should they all be binding? None? Some?), but I thoroughly enjoy the way money is dealt - and how it's worth absolutely nothing if you haven't progressed enough.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2014)

As I love negotiation games, I was keen on trying Quo Vadis. The game was flat on us, perhaps we need to do a lot more negotiating, however, what kills he game for me are the random VPs that come from the bag. In our game all the players were very close, so I reckon it was the luck of the VP chits that decided that match, sometimes a player could react before another snatched the VPs, but other times no one could react. I will play again to see if this is the case, but my desire is low.

The game is easy to learn and teach, and the gameplay is also short.

For now, I don’t want to play it again, however I plan to read the rules to see if we understood the game correctly.

After more plays I have enjoyed the game sometimes :D. However is very hard for me to win the game, most of the players won even consider a fair deal with me :devil:, but that doesn’t detract from the fun. This game really need a special group to shine.

I dislike the small chits and the folded board. I already bought the Mayfair edition. I will comment on that as soon as I play with the game.

I don't find this very interesting.  It does nothing for me that Traders of Genoa doesn't do, better.  A negotiation game has to motivate me to negotiate with other players, and "advance down the next path on the graph" isn't enough motivation.  Naturally I lose and don't have fun, because I don't care about the items for which I'm negotiating in the first place.

RATING: 7
I enjoy the idea that you have to convince your opponents to let you win.

Pros: It's easy to learn and teach. It favors negotiators and nearly requires backstabbing. If you want to win, you'll have to turn on somebody. It works with 4 or 5. Some of the "optional" rules are excellent.

Cons: With 3, it doesn't seem to work very well. Timid people may not really like it. It's often hard to have any idea if you're winning or not. The betrayal might lead to some hurt feelings.

Knizia negotiation game that I enjoyed but the rest of the group wasn't excited about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A different sort of game from Knizia. This is a game of opportunistic maneuvering and negotiation. If you don't like to negotiate with other players for actions, you won't like this game. I think I am finding that the more negotiation you have in a game, the simpler the game mechanics need to be. In Traders of Genoa, another popular negotiation game, I found that the potential choices each turn and how potentially involved those choices were in contributing to your point total made the negotiations really tedious. 

Quo Vadis, however, strips a lot of that away and makes it so that you are simply negotiating for a single vote in most cases and simply to move into the next space. This makes the negotiations such that you can assess the value of what is offered quickly, make a decision and move on. Love the balance you have to strike of making deals but trying to limit what you need to give up to the other players.

Players try to advance at least one pawn into the final room, along the way picking up laurels along some routes or by helping others advance. Only players who have at least one pawn in the final room can win. Of all players who have made it, the one with the most laurels wins.

One thing I'm unsure about is the impact of turn order. It feels a little too significant. As in, if you move Caesar (which gives a player a free passage without votes), it will always benefit another player. I know that game is designed this way to create another avenue of negotiation (I'll move Caesar here if you let me pass!), which is good, but turn order can possibly lead to some players consistently having fewer options than others. Not sure if this is true, but I thought about it.

That said, this is probably my favorite negotiation game. Even though I was playing b/c the others wanted to play, it wasn't a miserable experience.  And, it is well-designed and pretty interesting the way the majority-needed/progression works.  A very stream-lined, distilled, elegant design, and in that it is very Knizia, even if it doesn't have so much of his trademark mathiness.

Another Knizia dud. Players wheel and deal over whether or not their senators can advance to the next room. The objectives are essentially abstract but I suppose if you love negotiation out-of-context (borderline paradox, if you ask me), this might be interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an interesting game if only because it's a Knizia negotiation game. It's pretty much exactly what you would expect, the desire for balance and elegance leads to a strangle hold on the negotiations. This isn't really a bad thing if you aren't a huge fan of anything-goes negotiations that end friendships and breakup families. However it does make the game a bit dry. If you like the idea of negotiation but you don't like typical negotiation games then give this a try you might love it.

I like the game, it's dry and bit ridged for the genre but I don't really like other negotiation games and this one plays fast so it isn't dry for long. There are some neat choices and cute mechanics.

RATING: 6
Played two games with five players, which is said to be the optimal player count: both took about the listed 45 minutes, without dragging, and ended almost in a blink once the senate started filling. (In that way it kind of reminded me of Portobello Market.) There's a wobbly balance between building influence, spending momentum, sneaking your way into deals, and rushing at the end that's hard to pin down, and it should take several games to get a feel for what is or isn't good play. Definitely a case of setting up a precarious virtual tower of interests and capacities and trying to make it go your way once it topples, although being that it's a negotiation game there's always a risk that someone will agree to a lopsided or kingmaking deal. One issue I see is that you don't have a lot to negotiate with in the beginning; possibly everyone should start with a point (not taken from the negotiation pool, of course)?

I was expecting for a nice little negotiation game, but what I got: a dull game - which is, yes a negotiation game - but with big problems! Every player has a exactly same goal, so there are any surpise moments! Another issue is, that there are only couple of different choices to make, so you'll always need other players help to go forward AND if they don't help, there is nothing you can do. If I want to play negotiation games I'll prefer (for example) Traders of Genoa although its much longer game.

RATING: 8
Sole occupant of the niche of quick and elegant negotiation games, this early Knizia is a masterclass in game design. With a minimum of rules and a game board so reduced that it’s barely there, Quo Vadis nevertheless provides the fuel for tense and interesting decisions and negotiations. Such emergent design, where very few parameters interact in ways that create interesting and varied game states, is as rare today as it was in the dark ages of boardgaming when this little gem was created (1992), in spite of the bazillion more titles coming out nowadays.

I was dubious about this game, but it's now one of my favorites.  I love the player interaction, the wronk factor, and the great pieces.  Turned out to be a hit with the group, and I imagine it will see a lot of repeat play.

Last played with Donovan and Garrett (9/22/2006). This game was a surprise. Very tense. A lot of opportunity for screwage. I'm looking forward to playing with more than 3. At this point I would give it a 7 with 3 players...but I think it is more an 8 or 9 with 4 to 5 players. Stay tuned.

Won this at a raffle.  Obviously a pretty old game, although I was expecting late 90s and not early 90s.  Either way, this is a diplomacy game with very little luck involved.  

I do feel the game is more skill based than most diplomacy games and love the aspect of maneuvering around the senate to get your senator into the council.  However, I feel like there isn’t much room to negotiate since there isn’t many “mechanics” to discuss.

Um...I want to like it -- and I think I DO, in theory -- but so far there's been something missing in the actual game play.  Just seems to go so fast with very little thought being put into moves.  Maybe it'll perk up after we get to know it better.

I also really don't like the randomness of the token values.

Played with 3, standard game only.  There wasn't much player interaction.  Likely better with 4 or 5.  After my last play I said: "I'll give this one more go, with more players if possible."  That was thirteen months ago, and I haven't had the urge to play this even once in that time.

I wanted to like it--I was a classics major in college, and I love negotiation games--but it seems to have that trademark Knizia meh-ness.

I gave it away.  I can't imagine playing this when I have Cosmic Encounter and Dragon's Gold at hand.

Playing with less than five is a complete waste of time, as all players have an uncontested path to the Senate. But with five, it just felt lifeless. Nobody "gets" the game at first, so there's little negotiation--the game won't force it on you. Without interaction, any victory here feels hollow and pointless. I'm sure this would be a solid game with the right group, just not my group.

Negotiate with your opponents to move your senators up the senate to earn prestige. Friend bought this because it was a Knizia design, and we played it twice (3 and 4 player). I'm not fond of "negotiation" type games, so if you  enjoy trying to manipulate other people (if you vote for me here, I might vote for you there, etc) you might like it. Sometimes unfavorable deals get reached skewing the game. Not likely to be brought out again.

Simpatico gioco di Knizia che fa del commercio e delle contrattazioni il suo punto di forza. Vista la durata il gioco è anche godibile anche se potrebbero storcere il naso i giocatori più agguerriti e amanti dei german visto il fortissimo kingmaking, a me ad esempio ricorda Genoa per le contrattazioni senza troppa logica e più sulla simpatica e quindi non è il mio genere. Un simpatico passatempo senza troppe pretese. Fondamentalmente però è un astratto (un Knizia, diciamo), i materiali della prima edizione sono gradevoli.

Although the Amigo edition is less "classy" than the Mayfair edition, it is very portable, and this is great for a game that can be scheduled anywhere in between more heavy games.

Anyway I have the great Mayfair edition.

Knizia made here a clever tactical/negotiation game, with easy rules and a good challenge for 45 minutes. I like that type of negotiation game, like in Container: somehow complex but straightforward, unlike chaotic systems like in Genoa or In the Shadow of Emperor.

What a totally awesome, simple, short, and fascinating game! I found my copy for $10 here on the geek – what a bargain that was.  It would be simple enough to fabricate a homebrew copy, but I actually like Mayfair's production for a once.  The dreadful cover is the only downside.

The first time we played we ripped through three plays in a row.  [b]It has a classic feel, sort of like multiplayer checkers, but with nearly every move bargained for and negotiated[/b].  

BTW, certainly play with Knizia's open scoring variant: as soon as three colors are represented in the Inner Sanctum, any player may demand that all laurels be revealed. Or just play with open laurels the whole time..

(5+ plays) Only played a few games so far, but really enjoyed them.  Simple negotiation game that has a lot of possibilities.  However, the game seems to have some significant kingmaking issues.  That wouldn't be so bad if there was the right balance of negotiating options.  With the extra counters, the game seems to be about who draws what, and negotiating takes a back seat.  Without them, the game gets very dry, as so many options for deals are reduced if people are playing close attention to the laurels collected.  I think we will try a variant where the special chips do not recycle.  Then it will be a decision between good starting position and getting power chips before they are gone.  Game still has possibilities, but I have dropped by rating a bit.  Will definitely play again.

I received this game from my BGG Secret Santa in 2006.  I'm very pleased that it is in my collection - and not just because my Secret Santa sent it - but because it's a very unique game that really has no equal.

This is a pure negotiation game.  Other than pawns and victory point chits, everything that the player does comes down to his/her negotiation power.

The object of the game is to move your pawns from the lower class of Rome to the upper class.  The way that players will do that is by being promoted through the ranks.  The only way they will do THAT is if they are either clever enough to own majority influence within the circle of deciders OR if they can convince the other players in the group of deciders to let them move forward.

Once the player is successful in moving his/her pawn forward, s/he will receive the bonus that is associated (and randomized by chits) with the progression.

The person who has both a senator in the inner sanctum and the most points earned along the way will be declared the winner.

Now that you've got a picture of how it plays, you can see that this game is big-time negotiation.  One that relies extremely heavily on the players involved.  If I were to play this with 4 players who simply will not negotiate flat-out, then this game falls flat.  If, on the other hand, you find yourself surrounded by socialites who would like to try their hand at a proper negotiation game, then give this one a shot.

It's fun, conniving, and worth a space in my collection.  Thank you very much, BGG SS 2006!

Small box, intense game. Wheeling, dealing, and maneuvering. Getting your wannabe senators in a position where you don't need others but they need you is hard, and seeing all the deals happen on the other side of the table is painful.

Quo Vadis? is an old Knizia game, and unusually for him it's almost pure negotiation. We had a good time playing it but it was hard to assess with five first-timers.

RATING: 6
Elegant and quick negotigation game, marred by essential feature of the game: hidden scoring. Without this, the psychological factor of pretending not to be the leader (and thus not the target for bashing) is gone. This is simply personal taste; this game doesn't satisfy these two conditions:

* I like my negotigations nasty
* I don't like hidden information that can be easily tracked

UPDATE: Bought the very cute and small Amigo version!

Qvo Vadis é um jogo para pessoal com forte capacidade persuasora, um bom instrumento de treino para imobiliários e vendedores de automóveis, pois há que fazer da nossa oferta muito melhor do que aquilo que ela é e da oferta dos outros precisamente o contrário. Chinatown veio depois e é quase certo que sofreu grande influência deste jogo (que se distingue de todos os outros já editados pelo mestre Knizia); refinou a ideia, alterou os objectivos, conferiu côr, possibilitou mais controlo aos jogadores ao mesmo tempo que lhe adicionou uma pitada de sorte – resumindo: não faz sentido jogar Qvo Vadis? quando já se conhece Chinatown!

--Sept2007-- Not quite sure what to make of this!  It seems that it could either permit a light breezy devil-may-care kind of play, or a computationally heavy slow one.  I'd expect to enjoy the former, and despise the latter.  As a result, I'm not looking particularly to buy a copy; but if it were pulled out (with a set of folk I'd trust to play "right") I'd join 'em.

RATING: 6
Easy play, little luck, and a quick playing time, lead to an enjoyable game for me.  I like that the meat of this one is based on your negotiation skills combined with strategic placement of your senators.  Since score tiles are played radomly I feel like you are not in complete control of your destiny, but then again if your placing senators in decent positions you can at least try to circumvent poor scoring opportunities. Nice for an non-complicated but elegant experience.

Vintage Knizia, still feeling unique and fresh. I prefer it to Res Publica, where you are dependent on your opponents' goodwill as well. Here you can move along even without their consent- whereas in Res Publica, when your trade offers are boycotted, there is not much you can do to win.

Okay, I honestly haven't played this game the way it was MEANT to be played - BUT I teach high school students and I find that with a few modifications, the basics of this game work incredibly well. Instead of trying to get the most votes in a committee, players compete with the others to see who gets the right answer first. The winner moves up and gets as many points as the number of others they beat. The kids really enjoy playing this as they have some control who they go up against and I can see where the knowledge is lacking.
 
(update) 

I finally played this the real way. Very enjoyable even if none of us had much of a strategy...also a bit hard when you're the only one who is known for plotting and scheming (not to metion backstabbing) - nobody trusts anyone or willing to think "outside the box"

If you&#039;re looking for a relatively game where you don&#039;t have to wait a long time in between your turns, QV is a good choice.

Quo Vadis? -- Played once; four-player.  We really didn't negotiate much, and we played with the optional chips.  The score was 24, 24, 24, and 23.  The 23 was scored by the first to arrive at the sanctum, so the second to arrive won the tie.  I expect  this game to become more fun with familiarity and more involved negotiation.  Fun, interesting choices, without the decision-tension I often associate with Knizia.

Kniza does an ultra light-negotiation game coupled with tactical placement of strange looking plastic meeples.

Players are placing their senators and moving them up the board into the senate. Along the way, they pick up VP chips for passing certain points on the board and for supporting a person with a vote to move up.

Negotiations are light and easy. In Kniza fashion, players who have alot of chips but NO meeple in the senate cannot win.

Key is to get at least 1 senator in the senate and use the rest of the meeples to get VPs.

Not a bad game. Looks pug ugly though.

Politikusokat személyesítenek meg a figuráink, akikkel felfele haladunk a szenátusban. Adott helyekről az elmozdulás a többségtől függ, az mehet, aki többségben van vagy többséget tud szerezni a többiek szavazatával, amit megvesztegetéssel érhet el. Valamit ad cserébe a továbbjutásáért. Az úton a lépés közben lehet szerezni a győzelmi pontokat, amik véletlenszerűen kerülnek fel. A tematikája teljesen rendben van. Egyszerű, gyors. De egy olyan társas, amiben akár egy ember is teljesen el tudja rontani bárkinek a játékát, az a szememben nem játék, még akkor sem ha ez nem logikus viselkedés a játékban. Nem szeretem a megegyezős játékokat, mert minden az egymás közti viszonyon múlik még profik között is. De ettől eltekintve is úgy érzem lehetett volna ebből egy kicsit kevesebb interakcióval jobb játékot csinálni.

I don't see the appeal of this game but perhaps it's because I played it with people who were quite unexcited about it. As a negotiation game, it's banal (if you support me here, I'll help you there) and as a strategy game, it's too dependent on the negotiation aspect and on the luck factor of getting a high amount of prestige for a move. The theme is overall pretty good though and I could increase my rating with more plays.

Two plays with 5 and I loved them both.

8 is a preliminary rating as I see this only going up.  

I love negotiating games, but I get tired of long negotiations. I actually mean mentally exhausted.

This is a great negotiating game where the negotiations stay pretty short due to the fact that it is not so open-ended.  Usually it is just two people negotiating between two choices.  Plus, there is a lot of benefit to avoiding negotiations all together. This keeps things moving along nicely.  

It is all very clever actually.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3

Negotiations, kingmaking, threats of kingmaking, and backstabbing jampacked in 30 minutes.  If this game was longer, it would probably drive me nuts, but being 30-45 , minutes, makes this game an absolute blast.  Recommend highly.  Knizia makes the best short games.  Quite freeform and  the game changes based on the five players playing(i.e. replace one player and the game flavor shifts, replace two it shifts differently etc. etc.) .  Have little desire to play with less than five though, as acquiring a seat in the Senate becomes difficult instead of an eventuality.  It has an "Ooh thats neat" factor to the game.

This is a tough game to rank, I wouldn't have  desire to play this week after week but when the games are separated by ample time in between I have a grand ole time while this is on the table.  

Always surprised at the wide appeal and the positive successes I have had bringing this to the table.

Starts fun enough but seems to have problems ending. The non-winning players can prevent the game from ending for a very long time without anyone having much ability to catch up to the leader.

(The game basically has two currencies that can be traded, and essentially one of them will lose all of its value, making the game grind to a halt.)

But, a house rule or two can fix it I think.

Also, with few players (like 3) you have too much choice wrt senator placement I think. Perhaps in that case initial placement of a senator should be random so that players can't pick and choose which players they'll have to deal with.

Ein alter kleiner Knizia, gibts momentan (10/09) für 5€ bei Amazon. Jeder spieler repräsentiert eine Adesfamilie im Antiken Rom. Durch verschiedene auf einem Spielplan dargestellte Gremien muss man sich in den Senat vorarbeiten. Beim Vorrücken in ein höheres Gremium verdient man sich Lorbeeren. Wer am Ende des Spiels im Senat vertreten ist und die meisten Lorbeeren geerntet hat, gewinnt als angesehnster Senator das Spiel.
Manche dieser Gremien haben nur einen Sitz, andere bis zu fünf. Jedesmal wenn ein Spieler am Zug ist kann er einen seiner zahlreichen Senatoren bewegen. Entweder setzt man einen Senator in ein freies der untersten Gremien oder man bewegt in ein Gremium aufwärts in Richtung Senat. 
Wenn ein Gremium nur einen Sitz hat kann man sich selber einfach ein Gremium hochsetzen, verdient dafür jedoch keine Lorbeeren. Besteht ein Gremium aus mehreren Plätzen, so benötigt man die Mehrheit an Stimmen aus diesem Gremium um vorrücken zu dürfen. Diese Stimmen muss man sich natürlich teuer erkaufen. Entweder in dem man Lorbeeren die man fürs Vorrücken erhält aufteilt oder in dem man zusagt den Spieler später in einem anderen Gremium mit seiner Stimme zu unterstützen. Lorbeeren müssen sofort wie versprochen geteilt werden, jegliche Versprechen die erst nach dem Zug erfüllt werden müssten sind allerdings nicht bindend und können auch vergessen werden.
Thema und Spielmechanismen passen bei diesem alten Knizia-Klassiker einfach perfekt zusammen und wirken nicht ansatzweise aufgesetzt. Der Glücksfaktor ist im Grunde sehr gering und besteht nur aus den nachgezogenen Lorbeerplättchen, ansonsten hängt alles vom Verhandlungsgeschick und der cleveren Planung der Züge ab. Ein sehr schönes kleines absolut rundes und leicht zugängliches Spiel

If all you want is too negotiate without getting distracted by other mechanics or elements, this is the game for you.

Abstract & Negociations, a peculiar combinations, but it works really well. Might suffer from stereotypical gameplay after a while. Would like to test this preposterous opinion with great pleasure nevertheless

One play with 4.  Seemed to go almost too fast, which isn't usually something I think about a game.  Just didn't really enjoy it very much, even though I do tend to like most negotiation games.

An interesting negotiation game. Good for occasional play, but not a lot of replayability (at least with the same people).

Picked this up very cheaply, but I haven't tried it yet.  It's a Reiner game, so I imagine the mechanic going something like "at the start of the round, players bid to see who stabs Caesar first...."

This game has one of the most fun negotiation systems ever.  I love games where I'm free to talk and make deals, and this game is nothing but.  I will always play Quo Vadis if it is offered.

After one 5P play:  Fun, quick negotiation game.  Played w/o the special tiles.  Look forward to learning about those.
UPDATE:  Have played a few more times with mixed results.  Just like real negotiations.

RATING: 6
Negotiation game with very thin theme. Quite simple game, but not everyone likes these kinds of games, where it is kind of mandatory to tease other players.

The players pretend to be powerful families of Ancient Rome, scheming their way to the highest positions on the society and collecting victory points in the way.

Impressive. Though the placement of your pieces is more important that some think without being a good deal-maker you will be lost. Do not play this with just three players!

RATING: 6
 no excess chrome just brutal dry negotiation for chances to score VPs, with the added twist of needing to get at least one of your pieces to the Senate in order to be eligible to win. However, the game may be TOO distilled for its own good, and ultimately there seems to be a fragility to the system (only works with certain kinds of players, and even then I find some of the negotiations contrived)

This is one of my favorite Eurogames. Too bad few seem to agree. It has the wheeling and dealing in Diplomacy without the burden of betrayal. What's more, a session takes a little more than an hour!

Pure negotiation. Bought on a whim at Essen because it was cheap and Knizia. But after a solo run I am skeptical that there is any group I know that will enjoy this. Seems very pared down (this is the Amigo version) and I think I will stick to The Traders of Genoa for my negotiation standard.

RATING: 6
Played a few times (with 5 players). An archetypal negociation game with some very good ideas. The asymmetric board and the winning conditions make for tough decisions and intense negociations - which also means, of course, that not everyone will enjoy the game.

Very good negotiation game, supposedly not as nasty as Intrige, but I'm not sure that's the case.  Definitely has more game to it.  Would own a copy if the combination of artwork/pawn colors wasn't so heinous.

I enjoyed playing this, but it's a classic "breakable" game since it depends on teamwork and approval of others to advance. One player decides to constantly vote against another, or several meta-game decide to play a certain way and... well... it wrecks the experience.

I will grudgingly concede that smooth talking could be considered as a skill in boardgaming.  I just don't think a game that rewards someone for his ability to coax people to get what he wants is enjoyable, and thus my lack of enthusiasm for any kind of negotiation titles (although I won't refuse to try anything once).  Quo Vadis suffers tremendously from the fact that one person can gain significant advantage if the player before him consistently fails to deny him lucrative positions.  Not to mention the susceptibility to bashing the leader, kingmaking and metagaming.  Not my cup of tea at all.

Surprisingly quick, light, painless, fun negotiation game that you can play with your friends without coming to hate one another.  We enjoyed this so much that all 4 newbies wanted to play it again immediately thereafter.

Played it with my family - they aren't so cut-throat as my usual gaming group is. I can see how this game rises and falls with the right players. At the moment i'm giving it a 5, judging only by one play. Almost certain that my rating will rise when i play it with my gaming buddies.

RATING: 6
Sandboxy negotiation game. The game is fine for what it is, but it is just not my cup of tea. Bumping this up from a 5 to a 6 based on my last game play. Understanding the rules from the start made for a lot better experience and implementing what I learned from the last game helped in my own negotiation offers.

RATING: 6
Interesting mechanics with the negotiations and all. Maybe we were not concentrating on the game enough as we played it in less than 20 minutes and the game just had no depth at all. I would like to try again.

3/15/07 - I love negotiation games, and Quo Vadis? packs quite a bit of negotiation into  a very short, accessible package.  The only other entry in this category that I'm aware of is Intrigue, but Quo Vadis? is less contrived and "gamey".  Don't discount it.

7/17/06 - Rating 9:  I've played Quo Vadis? one time only.  It was for my birthday and I made a bunch of non-believers play it, knowing that it was going to be an awesome experience...and it was.  Don't let this game's demure facade fool you into thinking it's dull;  it's anything but.  My loud mouth eventually got me shut out of the inner sanctum, but it was a lot of fun getting there and I've been itching like mad to play this game again.  If you like negotiative games, I think this game will really deliver for you, though I get the unfortunate impression that negotiation games are not all that en vogue with gamers these days.  

I've played Quo Vadis? more times now, and it rocks harder than ever.

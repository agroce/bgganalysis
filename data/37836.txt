A fun 2 player block war game about the Roman civil war between Caesar and Pompey.

Pros:
Great theme. Fairly simple rules. Good repayability. Very strategic game. Blocks give fog of war and keep players guessing. Fun. 

Cons:
Blocks obscure the features of the board (the board could do with being slightly bigger). The board isn't mounted and doesn't lay flat. Set up can take a while as you place specific units in specific locations (for standard set up). The game seems to end too quickly. 

N.B.
Cleopatra is rarely used and seems pretty redundant.

Really fun game. As Caesar you have to be active and take advantage of your stronger legions or you can lose on the very first turn. Pompeius has easier access to VPs and is a bit stronger at sea but his forces are scattered.
For the price it's a pity that the map is not mounted.

Upgrade to 9 after several plays with diferent opponents.
This is a fantastic Block game with lots of strategy and choices for BOTH players.
So many decisions and several paths to victory (or defeat) that replayability is granted.
A great design and very balanced.
Several years after been published and NO ERRATA or upgrade editions!!! a rarity with Columbia!
A par with Rommel this is one of the best from CG.
Playing time: 2:00 to 3:30

Another Columbia block game using the familiar [thing=3685][/thing] system.

This one uses roads and paths connecting cities instead of hexes between areas, so instead of hexside limits, the quality of the road determines how many units can travel down it.  This makes for a much cleaner system.

Event cards are a big boost and match the theme for how the Romans believed the gods controlled their destiny.  Some folks grouse about this, but it was historical.

The A-B-C combat system remains in place, where the more mobile units fire first, but the strength of the units is reflected in how many dice it can roll.

Certain cities have victory point values and if one side controls 10, he wins.  Otherwise, after the 5th turn, it is whoever has the most.  Pompei holds a huge initial advantage, but Caesar has more power, so Julius has to hit hard/hit fast.  Meanwhile, the map is punch-counter punch.  Each side has inherent advantages and the end result is a very tight game with loads of replayability.  I have seen the game come down to a big fight at nearly every location except Utica.

Columbia's three best games are Julius Caesar, Rommel in the Desert, and Eastfront.

RATING: 7
A good entertaining game with strategy value in the use and dispersion of troops over the expanse of the Roman Republic Empire. There is the luck of the dice but you can mitigate that with more troops you can recruit but troops are limited and strengthening one place does weaken another. Good theme (Does show the same issue Caesar and Pompey may have had) and gameplay.

Caesar is a fun and fast game. My only initial disappointment is the naval game that does not allow amphibious attacks and allows to a single navis to control a sea.

One of the simplest of the Columbia block games, weighing in at just seven and a bit pages of rules, including the set-up.  Julius Caesar pulls off the trick of being one of the most strategically interesting of them - and in a short playing time too.

The situation is intriguing from the start: Pompey begins the game with seven vps to Caesar's one and yet his forces are scattered around the Mediterranean.  Caesar's are concentrated and have the edge in punching power.  Caesar must attack, but where?  There's also a constant tension between movement and garrisoning, between attacking now and building (or re-building) your forces.

Sea movement adds a dimension.  While land movement is plodding, movement by sea is reminiscent of the convoys of Diplomacy; chains of ships make swift lunges across the Med possible and keep the players on edge.  The limitations on land movement mean that it is really difficult to mass an overwhelming force.  Bloody, low odds battles abound and units that hit early and hard are invaluable.

The map is pleasing and quite functional.  I've found fewer problems with blocks obscuring game information than in other games.  The cards are well produced, although their artwork is a bit dull.  The edition 1.01 rules seem remarkably complete.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A truly great gamesystem that can be played in 2.5 hours. I especially like the way fleets co-operate with the land-based units. Very clever!

Many strategic options are availlable and daring moves may pay out. However in battles there may be a certain amount of luck.

I really, really enjoyed my first two plays of this: back to back, playing both sides. 3 hours for the first play, 2.5 for the second. Subsequent VASSAL plays have also been excellent: deep, varied, plenty to think about. The rules are simple, the map clean, so you are straight into strategy and planning your game. Lots to consider, works very well, and so much in a convenient play time. What more could one ask for?

Elegant. Second block wargame I own (the first being Hammer of the Scots).

One thing I've noticed is that this game is particularly brutal compared to the relatively forgiving HotS. 

The game system is the same, but not so similar that they feel like the same game. Just enough to make HotS a good introduction to Caesar (as there are a few more rules nitpicks).

My same complaint of JC as HotS though: non mounted board, and in JC's case, the city locations are a bit small and are often covered by the blocks.

Rules are not so complex (more than average eurogame, but I guess extremely simple for a wargame).  But I cannot control all the information, it is just me.  I liked the blocks, it's a nice idea to track the information of units.
I was beaten by the end of second turn, and probably could have been before...

While a fun game, it's hard to get past silliness of planning for a volcano to attack your opponent's key force.  And even sillier when opponent invokes Apollo and attacks you right back with another volcano.  Wow!  They must have had really great seismologists back then.  =O)  But if you can accept this as just campy, and perhaps conceptually substitute "plague" or "cholera" or some such similar misfortune for volcano, then it's not as silly.  And it is just a game, and it is fun, and it plays well, and requires lots of decisions, and there seems to be deep strategy in what you need to do to maximize possibility of victory . . . gods willing.  And perhaps best of all, it plays quickly, so there's always time for another game, especially if the gods were unkind to you.  I'd rate higher, maybe an "8," if designer hadn't rated as a "10."  BTW, I bought red blocks for Romans and used tan blocks for Pompeii.  Looks great, probably because green blocks otherwise blend in too much with board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cute, clean, quick and fun block game which unfortunately offers a limited number of viable options for players. First mover is disadvantaged and this means Ceasar is the underdog. Not taking Rome on first card is a mistake.

A great deal of the board is not used, why bother?

Overall ok+.

Man, what a fun, fast-moving and keenly balanced game this is!

Pompey has an early advantage in taking territory, but Caesar has more than a match in strength to take territory back over the long-haul. And the available fleets are absolutely necessary to move forces in unexpected directions. Chrome is kept to a necessary minimum while theme is kept just high enough to impart a sense of the period.

The rules for maneuver, combat, and occupation are pretty simple and each operation and replacement expenditure is an important, incremental decision to each player's overall plan.

Block density is also fairly low and the players are in control of their own reinforcement schedule.

Great fun for veteran and novice block-game players!

RATING: 10
Initial thoughts:  

Great, smoothly playing game.  Seems to be lots of depth with little rules overhead to get in the way.

After a few more plays:

What an amazing game! I read through the eight pages of rules and thought "is this all there is to it"? The first game was interesting. I wondered if the game play would get stale with just a couple of strategies.

But after a half dozen plays every game has played out completely differently. There is some "magic" to this game that I can't quite figure out. Maybe having the Mediterranean Sea in the middle of the board is the secret. Movement tends to be fast using ships across the sea but slow over land around the periphery. Positions can appear static but then change dramatically in a few surprising moves.

There is a sub game all to itself about controlling the sea zones. Then I discovered you can use navies with their attached marines to aid your land battles and my mind was blown. Suddenly the sea zone sub-game became intertwined with the land battles. Add to this the card play which add just the right amount of chaos to make a turn never certain, hidden but varied units to allow bluff, and you have a classic game that will always have a cherished place in my collection. 

Oh, and you get this great experience in 2-3 hours. What more could you want in a war game?

This is my favorite block wargame thus far.  Unlike our other main block game, Richard III, the map movement is much more restricted and hence much tougher.  Likewise, reviving your units works like most traditional block games, that is, one step at a time, which also makes spending your levees more difficult.  Plus, unlike Richard, the cards are a bit more restrictive, as you can't split up your actions amongst moves and levees, but have the split dictated for you.  It plays fairly quickly too.  A very elegant design, and it simulates the difficulties of ancient warfare well.

Impressions are solidifying that this is winner, and a welcome return to quality for Columbia.  Blends flavors from Hammer and Columbia's earlier classic games, 1812 and Quebec. Meatier and more interesting than the classics, and more open and strategic than Hammer. Definitely seems like a keeper.
---
First impressions, and I've come to distrust first impressions of block games and CDGs ... the blocks and cards seem to have in inherent fun factor that can get me past the first play or two even if the underlying game isn't that great. After several disappointments from Columbia, most notably Athens vs. Sparta, their stock of goodwill with me had been drawn down.

But I was favorably impressed with Julius Caesar. I think splitting the levies and moves on the cards was a good move, and I like that the events are for the most part fairly powerful, adding genuine uncertainty and tension. The need to balance garrisoning cities and mobilizing to attack, and the local nature of raising most forces, makes for interesting strategic choices. And sea control is an important and interesting dimension, allowing rapid re-deployment but at significant expense.

Like a lot of block games, at the end of the day it does come down to inflicting favorable attrition, but the balance here feels right; replacement rates fill tight but enough to be interesting, geographical control is important but not the be-all and end-all, etc.

I do think it's just a touch on the long side, and it can end before it's over, but not by a lot. It's not the fast-paced do-or-die slugfest Richard III was, but on balance I thought Richard III was maybe a little too far in that direction.

On balance, first impressions were very positive, I enjoyed this is much as anything from Columbia since Crusader Rex, and I look forward to giving it some more play.

After [thing=3685][/thing], I was interested in other Columbia block games that had a bit more openness and a bit less of the mid board clog of HOTS. JC sounded like just the thing and it didn't disappoint. While it doesn't feature the same fickle nobles of HOTS (well, it does have cleopatra), it does have some very good mechanisms of its own. The navis are critical to providing the openness of the board, and they do the job admirably. Their wintering rules add just enough balance. But a more subtle but excellent feature is the city-based levying system that provides players with interesting intermediate objectives. I do have a concern, though, that a victory for Caesar is only possible by following a pretty basic line - secure Italy, move east for the levies, strengthen against Spain and try and grab a few centers there and in North Africa.

The pinnacle of Columbia block games and one of the finest wargames ever designed. It is amazing how vivid and engaging a warfare it can portray, with just a few rules. Julius Caesar is one of these games which after a while rise above the rules, resulting in pure strategic thinking: where to attack, where to land, how to entice your opponent to make mistakes, when to withdraw to fight another day. If you can live with the fortunes of war as impersonated by the cruel, cruel but exciting dice, then there is a wealth of pleasure and cunningness to discover and limitless replayability. Outstanding.

Basically, similar to Hammer of the Scots, without the nobles who change allegiance. Not sure I like the Gods cards, in what is otherwise an historical combat-centered game. 

Very nice components, with the exception of the lack of a mounted mapboard.

Initial rating after 1 play. Decent [i]Hammer of the Scots[/i] clone with a couple minor twists. I'm not really sure what to make of those special cards, though. It felt a little chaotic. Without them, however, the game might be too dry.

Anyway, it's ok, but I don't really see any reason to play this over [i]Caesar XL[/i] which, in my opinion provides more interesting game play for much less money.

RATING: 8
Rating after one play (8).

This was one of the most enjoyable first game experiences I have had in a long time (and I've been wargaming for nearly 40 years - I own the Gamma II edition of Quebec 1759!).

In Julius Caesar I particularly enjoyed:
1. The asymmetric, strategically challenging, start positions.
2. The requirement that new units can only be raised in certain geographic locations.
3. Diversity of units but not chaotically so.
4. Special event cards which introduce uncertainty but not chaos.
5. Clean rules/system - easy to play - you can focus on playing not remembering rules - even first time through.

Want to play again - rating should go up.

Recommended to anyone who likes block games.

Interesting "new school" block game, themed on the civil wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey Magnus.  The game begins with Julius about to cross the Rubicon, and the onus is upon him to attack.  Play for five years or until one side owns 10 victory points of real estate (or defeated leaders).  Nice game that fits nicely into the newer style of low-complexity Columbia games.  Rules are surprisingly loose - we had a lot of questions after our first play through.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful game with simple elegant system of play that contains quite a few nuances that work to reflect the historical sweep of the struggle between Caesar and Pompeii.  I particularly have come to like the block system and the uncertainty it introduces into gameplay - no more knowing exactly where your opponents units or their strength until battle hits.  Highly recommended as an introduction to wargaming for new players but also as a good game for face to face or tournament play as it can easily be played in a few hours.

While I enjoy a good Columbia block game every once in a while, they are starting to blur into each other since the ruleset is always the same and the units are sensibly the same. Wish that there was more to differentiate the different games than just the maps and the unit mix.

2017-03-19 : First play and thanks to the simplicity of the rules you can direct 100% of your brain to strategic and tactical considerations. Sure, there's luck in there, but due to the amount of dice rolling this should even out over the course of a game. Rating it an 8 for now, but there's potential there for moving up.

"Bravo Zulu" for Julius Caesar.  I've played a couple of games since getting it this week (thanks for the quick ship -- in my eagerness, unfortunately, I put Caesar's stickers on the green squares and Pompey's on the tan just because I thought the colors more attractive that way) and I have to say, instant jump to top five wargames I've ever played.

I've been enjoying tabletop and miniature wargames since the late 70s (Tactics II by AH was the first I learned) and I'm not easily impressed, but wow!  The rules are simple, yet deep, and the block system offers just the right amount of fog-of-war.  There are plenty of decision points and just the right amount of luck thanks to the cards and dice.  Fortune favors the prepared in this game, which is about right for ancient battles. The Combat Resolution System managed to accommodate speed, striking power, and attrition into a fairly simple combat system.

Now that I'm a father of three, I also appreciate a game that can be played in a couple hours, with plenty of room for food and drink on the table.  The game might have been a 9, because I think the movement system is just a little confining (you might spend a lot of turns only able to move one set of blocks), but it deserves an extra point for being a great title to introduce new tabletop gamers to the hobby.

Columbia really knocked this one out of the park.  The only negative is I have to sit down with my blu-ray of HBO's ROME again.  This game sure put me in the mood to rally to the 13th Legion's Eagle.

Great introduction for new wargamers (like me). Relatively simple rules (but be warned though, there are quite a few misleading exceptions), fast setup and dynamic play. And most importantly, blocks provide exciting fog of war with possibilities of bluffing and bold maneuvres. Great game - looking for many more sessions to come.

Another fantastic introductory block war game from Columbia Games, building on the successful system from the popular games HotS and Richard III.  See my comprehensive pictorial review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/573238

I like this game because it's tactical wargaming, pure and simple. Dudes on a map, as I like to say, and I love games with important movement considerations. The rules are quite simple but the decisions are delicious. My opponent landed forces on the African coast which was very scary for the Pompey player, however, that meant Spain was easily mine and I could even threaten Rome. You can hardly do anything in the game without exposing yourself somewhere else.

I played Pompey both times and must say, it's tough for both sides b/c Caesar gets more powerful as the game goes on and Pompey has to play defense and protect Alexandria (it's worth 2 big points that can decide the game). I lost Alexandria in my first game so I did a better job of protecting it in my second. You feel the pressure trying to play defense and slow Caesar down but at the same time, the pressure is on the Romans b/c they start off so far down in VPs. Seems well balanced.

for me this ends up being "just another (Blank)" I love the history behind the game, but the play balance seems off and there seems no way to convey the politics that made this conflict so interesting.

The straw that breaks it for me is the event cards that are automatic...at least in HotS you have to roll to turn a block.

My new favorite Columbia block game.  Achieves asymmetry through starting positions rather than unit balance or special powers.  I especially love the need to move to specific cities to raise legions and cavalry units; it makes the decision to give up one unit and preserve another more agonizing, and drives play into areas that might otherwise be ignored.

RATING: 7
Completely straight-forward block game and very enjoyable I think just for that reason.  There's quite a few layers of tension.  One, you want to use your leaders since they're excellent pieces, but you really don't want to lose them because they're points for the other side.  Two, there's a nice balance between having to roam the countryside in search of recruits, and just simply pushing forward with the troops you've got.  The game is quite short, there's a lot of pressure on Caesar to be constantly aggressive.  Three, you just can't take over the whole map as Caesar.  You've got to pick and chose the areas you want to focus on all while Pompey tests the weakest links in your chain. The additional level of sea control was a nice aspect.  I think I still like Richard III the best of the Columbia block games, but this is an even better introductory block game.

RATING: 8
Solid simple rules wargame. This game holds a special place in my gamer heart as I've implemented a digital version. After playing it like 15 times in total I went from love to feeling it got old. Lately going back to cherish it. It beats HotS by far. Even if it can seem scripted, games always show new aspects of the rules never seen before. Late game conquest of Rome by Pompei, conquest of Alexandria by Caesar, big fleet shore attacks, troops moving across whole map by sea. Unexpected use of special cards (feeling safe across a straight and beeing set up by mercury). Small army attacked gets a reserve -
 Disruption - no way to retreat - extermination.

Three plays. I enjoyed it. It's not as detailed and immersive as the other wargames I've played, but it provides a dramatic, strategic experience with lots of flavor. We were able to finish it our games in under three hours, and I don't think we botched a single rule. 

Obviously I don't have a lot of experience with the game, but seems to me that the situation begins with Pompey within striking distance of victory, and so Caesar is really under the gun. 

One observation, which is not necessarily a criticism: the event (god) cards are powerful and can ruin players' finely crafted plans. Obviously this can be frustrating when it happens to you, but on the other hand it keeps the game from being too predictable. And hey, in real life, shit happens.

Just great.  I was a bit disappointed with it when I first started playing because it seemed too simple, like there just wasn't much to it.  I was wrong; There's a lot of game here.

Games are pretty well balanced, with Pompey having a slight advantage, though this advantage might disappear with more experience.  The board is open, and no clear dominant strategy presents itself.  God cards are very powerful in the right circumstance, but are just a pain in the ass in the wrong ones, because playing a God card prevents any other moving or levying.  I play with a house rule that anyone dealt four God cards can request a redeal.

Play is tense and quick.  The 2.5 hours fly by.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Tricky one for me. It is right up my street in period terms and subject matter. It looks great, the blocks are really beautiful as is the board itself. I enjoy the game play and like the recruiting rules too. 

I find it hard to play and often, if playing Caesar lose out to a good Pompey player who either steals the vp towns if I play a too defensive game or if I play more aggressively seems to hole up and great large defences that I struggle to defeat. 

Caesar really does need to get good usable cards if he is to take the offensive to Pompey and usually what happens is that I either get text cards which don't overly help me or the low value ops cards. 

The card recruiting and movement are fine but I really do not like the text cards in this game. They are sort of thematic but I don't like Vulcan and his blummin eruptions or the variable allegiance one although that is thematic but very powerful indeed. I think it might be nice to play a game of this without the text cards one day. 

The mechanism that I do really like in this title is the draw 6 cards, look at them and then cast one out from your hand....that does at least help to mitigate against a heavy text based hand and allows for an element of planning and I would actually like to port that mechanism into other Columbia block games like Richard III or Hammer of the Scots even.

On the fence with this game, probably need to play it more and with different people to see its real value.

Just got this one. It is my first 'block' war game. I have had one game and really enjoyed it. Looks to be a great 2 player game that I will enjoy for a long time. I especially like the asymmetrical sides of Caesar vs. Pompey.

May 2017 I've played against 4 different opponents and I've gotten a lot better at it and can see deeper strategies emerging. Definitely worth sticking with it and becoming a better player over multiple plays. Initial strategies aren't obvious - to me at least. You have to respond wisely to what your opponent is doing. The luck factor balances out over the length of a normal game.

If it wasn't for the high luck factor during combat, i'd give this a higher ranking.

This is my favorite Columbia block game. I've played Hammer of the Scots and Richard III. It plays faster than either one. Has a vastly more readable board than Richard III. Is more fluid than Hammer of the Scots.

From setup to finish you can be done with a game in 60-90 minutes. The Navis (sea movement) make the game more dynamic than other Columbia games I've played.

I've never had a problem with God cards. They're just events like in any other game. Never understood the brouhaha.

Pompeii starts with the lead and needs to finesse a victory. Caesar is the more certain long-term candidate. Even when Caesar's victory feels certain it can take a while for him to rack up the necessary victory point to makes it definite, which is a bit of a downside; there just aren't enough reinforcement points to stage a comeback when you're too far down.

Overall, though, I love the quick play and the choices of the interaction between cards and blocks.

RATING: 6
Quite a good game, although not very historical. The blocks system is interesting, and it's nice to have blocks for individual legions: but having separate blocks for elephants is just silly at this scale. The same is true with cavalry - it would make much more historical sense to roll these things into some kind of combat bonus, rather than giving them individual blocks.

The way the leaders work is also strange - the game seems to want to simulate the whole civil war period down to the Triumvirate, but within the timeline of the war between Caesar and Pompey. Scope for a variant homebrew scenario here on Augustus and Antony, using the lovely map.

I do like the idea of block games, but neither this one nor Hammer of the Scots really worked for me, I think because of the scaling issue and because of the combat resolution system. I think Hellenes might be the one for me.

PbeM suitability: medium, as battles can be very log-intensive. It's harder to remember which blocks are which at PbeM timescales (not sure if that's a positive or negative).

First few plays and a very favourable impression. Julius Caesar seems to be the best Columbia Game since Crusader Rex. The layout of the map and the naval rules ensure that play is not restricted to a small area: at any point the action can switch geographical focus. The two sides are more subtly differentiated than in, say, Hammer of the Scots or Crusader Rex but the difference seems to be sufficient to add flavour to the game.

Finally got around to playing this title, and got to answer my 4 year old question, is it better than HOTS? In a word, I think so, maybe [i]just[/i] though, I think I prefer the really cool theme of HOTS, but maybe the gameplay here just due to luck being a little lower and due to options being more "open" (sea helps HUGE here). 

[u]Big pros for this game are:[/u] 

- Very low rules overhead, rules totally melt into the background after one year(round), and easy to learn

- Designed to be fast, could be over in 60mins, 150mins should be tops after a game or two. 

- Simple but still strategic. You can craft some neat little plans, since you get 5 cards to start a year, you can also plan beyond those 5 really too, you just may have to adjust plans due to dice, opponent, cards, etc. 

- FUN

[u]Negatives:[/u] 

- Luck factor is a little high, but maybe not bad for the length

- Only one "Scenario", apparently decently replayable though as games can take on different "faces"

---

So there are some very powerful God cards, which are going to trigger first and do mostly nasty things, nothing game breaking, but could throw a wrench in your plans so a little chaotic. Again, even with these, it is only a 2 hour game and cards like these do keep you on your toes so to speak and add a little uncertainty, this could be good or bad depending how you look at it.  

I was a little disappointed with the game in 2 areas; several restrictive rules and lack of card variation (and luck was maybe a touch high but not crazy). For the cards, there are only TWO types, God cards and Command cards; God cards do a special power, Command let you move and recruit or heal. That's it. Elegant maybe, but I would have liked to have seen some other option or two, though I might get used to it and it's just different than what I'm used to. 

Restrictions were more troubling, and its come up in many other wargames and maybe a personal pet peeve. You could not attack by sea for example, you would have to land in a city adjacent, then opponent has time to beef the city up before you get to attack. You also could not move an army more than once. Recruiting was also difficult as there were low amounts of pips on cards needed for recruiting. Now there were good reasons for these things to be designed the way they were, like keeping the game shorter (recruiting) and keeping you safe from a crippling sneak attack (move rules) but I always find it hard to get things done with these kinds of rules, maybe its just me.  

What I really liked was the strategic nature and the usual elegant block design, like "A3" conveying a powerful leader by giving him initiative and potentially more hits in battle, and of course the usual health system of just rotating the block when taking damage until dead. 

Overall I think its a great little entry level wargame, that while rules-wise is very easy and intuitive, gameplay-wise it presents you with enough decisions to keep your interest and make it fun. I just may pick it up to play with the wife, too bad price is so high for what you get. There really aren't enough short GOOD [i]strategic[/i] wargames, there are hundreds of tactical ones but I am tired of tactical and I don't find the decisions interesting enough as I like to craft plans. 

UPDATE - Started a game where I got the 2 best god cards on the first turn as JC, this did not bode well at all (but shouldn't happen often hopefully). Then for the whole year, I could only roll 5's and 6's (have I mentioned I hate dice?). Needless to say this was not a good experience, if it happens again I'll have to lower my rating. This is the trouble with most games using dice like this though and even cards and not just this one, really luck should only "ruin" maybe 1 in 5 or 6 games (which really is still too much for me)

Better than HOTS?

RATING: 9.5
Columbia's latest is a real winner.  JC is a nice blend of the classic War of 1812 (point to point movement) and the new HOTS game mechanics.

Games usually come down to the wire and both sides seem to be well balanced.

My only complaint is that the board could be larger (although it is apparently Columbia's largest to date).  Too often you'll have blocks overflowing into multiple cities.

If you like block games you'll enjoy this one.

Combat feels like something from the Age of Rifles (with heavy and at times pyrrhic losses) and the (in)ability to quickly replace losses is suspect, but the actual gameplay is full of tough choices and proved satisfyingly immersive.  The situation is much more balanced than the last couple Columbia offerings I tried, which makes it a much easier game for new players to sit down with and enjoy.  That said, the more experienced player should take Caesar because old JC carries the burden of the attack and has to play well to overcome Pompey's VP advantage.

I have been really impressed with Julius Caesar: I own a number of Columbia games, but JC has really hit the sweet spot; streamlined rules, good game length, an expansive (and attractive) map, offering a game of real manoeuvre, with good replayability. Probably my current pick of the Columbia games if you have not played one before.

As the Designer I will always believe in my games! I have played over 300 games of Julius Caesar and I can tell you.....you are in for a great time playing it. 

I hope you enjoy my first game design. I also hope it won't be my last! It's kind of like having a baby. 

Also thanks for all the kind words about my game design. It really means a lot to me to hear it!

A great game, but I definitively rate it a bit lower than Hammer of the Scotts.  In all of our games, two things nibed at us.  First one is we spend too much time trying to rebuild forces, second is there isn't enough turns because of that, and we always seems to end the game in the middle of a push.  HoTS allows for more long term planning.

Caesar has a multi-front war on his hands so there is lots to do.

Fun, light, quick asymmetrical block game that offers interesting challenges for both sides -- although it seems to me that Caesar's work in the early game is just survival.

RATING: 8
After 2 plays, I was soundly beaten by Andzrej's Caesar in both!  I should say this is a great game on the Roman Civil War!  As Caesar, Andzrej adopted an aggressive strategy in the east and centre, towards Byzantium (Antichos) and Rome.  He deployed Caesar to the east, guarding the straits and then wait for the right moment to strike.  In the first game, I urged Pompey to attack Rome and across the straits on the east.  That proved to be disaster and Pompey was killed.  The second game couldn't spare Pompey's life either.  Scipio replaced him in both games.  Andzrej won both games with 10 VPs.  By now, you can imagine how poor I was as Pompey.

The rules are simple to read and absorb with only 8 pages.  The labels, as you can pretty much expect the quality from any one of the Columbia Games.  The legions, auxilia, equitatus, ballista, navis, these are all types of units, illustrated lavishly with fine details.  The leaders are all illustrated with their historical head statues, Caesar, Pompey and their lover Cleopartra!  (Note: After a battle, Cleopatra can switch side by joining the winning side! An opportunitist!)

The game begins in 49BC and ends in 45BC, just before Caesar was assasinated in 44BC.  Each game has 5 yearly turns.  The time scale is perfect for such a strategic look at the Roman Civil War.  Basically, the war was fought on 3 fronts - Byzantium in the east, Rome and Sicily in the centre, and Gaul/ Spain in the west.  Both sides deployed on the map according to the set up card.  The set up is a blast.  

Each turn is divided into 3 phases - Card Phase, Command Phase and Battle Phase.  In Card Phase, both players play one card onto the table and reveal them simultaneously.  If both sides play event cards, they cancel each other out and the game turn ends!  (I think we played this wrong as we continued the turn into the year.)  Each card bears the name of a God, e.g. Mars the God of War grants a surprise attack to the attacker to attack first in the Battle Phase (normally it is the defender who conducts combat first).  The most powerful card I think is Vulcan, which is not a God but reduces all blocks in a designated city by one step, even to the point of eliminating the last step of a unit or leader.  

Cities are connected with road, major or minor.  Moving a group of 4 blocks is allowed along a major road, 2 blocks if minor.  A group can move 2 cities, if not attacking.  Otherwise, battle ensues when the group moves into an enemy controlled city.  Response movement can be made by friendly group from adjacent cities to reinforce the defending city.  Only 2 units are allowed to move across the strait.  However, only one is allowed to attack across it.  So, don't ever try to attack across the strait unless you are pretty sure why you have to.  Navis movement is similar.  There are a total of 9 sea zones and numerous ports along the coastline.   

Battle system is the standard convention for a block game that, surprisingly though, is well applied to the ancient time as well.  Each block can have different number of steps, up to a maximum four (of course....a block can only have so many edges.)  A battle hit reduces a block one step by rotating it to the lower one.  One thing I questioned about block games is that the strength of a block is always pre-determined abstractly by the number of steps 1 to 4, instead of a strength number.  It is hard to believe that combat strength of unit blocks can be utilized the same across different time span in history, from ancient, colonial to WW2. Anyway, Julius Caesar, there are some interesting units like Elephants, which have 2 steps only and thus fragile to be eliminated, and Ballista, attacks more effectively at a higher class when defending.           

Levies is an interesting sub-system in block games and in my view, simulates the replacement rate of the ancient armies very well.  Each command card has 1 to 3 Levy Points.  They can be used to bring the existing units on the map one step up by 1 LP, or bring in a new block onto the map friendly cities or, in case of the legion, in the named city printed on the block.      

A Winter Turn occurs when all 5 cards in hand have been played.  Cleopatra must move back to Alexandria, where she begins her journey wherever.  Navis move back to friendly port on the same sea (I think we played this wrong too as we thought it was not an automatic move but needs to expend MPs, which doesn't.)  All cities can supply a maximum 3 blocks plus the value of the city.  Each surplus block is disbanded to the Levy Pool.  It is hard and requires player's planning skill and long range ability to foresee what would happen in a year's time.

All in all, this is a game that fills with tension and compactness.  Block games are not my cup of tea usually but I admit this is the best block game since I played Eastfront and Hellenes.  Every ancient zealot should buy and play this excellent game.  On the surface, the game seems to be constrained by the areas to move around with.  The strategy one can employ is embedded deeply inside the game system, the map, the units, which is not easily seen but to be explored by the players.  Historicity exudes and flows naturally throughout the gameplay.

Yep...This is a good game. Believe it. Simple components and rules but the result is a tight and tension filled contest. Sure there is luck, but it isn't excessive and it's an integral part of the abstraction that you have to account for. Sometimes the gods are with you. Sometimes they aren't.

This game seems to get better with more plays. Lots of potential for analysis paralysis, but the tension is nail biting even when waiting your turn.

Built an enlarged 12 piece board for a more grand feel. Used the individual panel method instead of a folding board. Adhesive label paper on adhesive vinyl floor tile, on non-slip shelf liner.

I have an extra enlarged map for trade - 22.25"x43"

Subject: I playtested Julius Caesar as Pompey
I enjoyed playtesting the game even though I got a bloody nose playing as Pompey. This strategic level game is set in the waning days of the Roman Republic and the players will determine the fate of that Republic. It's hard to find good strategic games and there are not that many from this period of history. 

The game is well balanced. The difference between victory and defeat will often be a knife edge. Players will want to try different tactics and no two games will be alike. This game will be replayed. I enjoyed the texture of the componets which added to the enjoyment of playing.

I'm not sure what it is about block games that leave me cold. The fog of way & step reduction elegance that the blocks provide are fantastic, but the high strategic scale that often goes with them isn't as enjoyable for me. Maybe because that scale feels like it should have more political and economic systems, too.

Another of my favourite periods- and looks a quick way to get into a Pompey versus Caesar fight without the many hours and multiple playrs needed for Republic of Rome. Will try out with opponent soon.

Updated- 6 or 7 games in and it is excellent. Mainly Pompey victories so far, but Caesar players learning fast what needs to be done (me included).That said he seems to have the tougher ask- always attacking and one bad defeat can quickly derail a whole campaign. But with sea superiority to ensure where to strike, and prevent the Pomepeians from reinforcing threatened sectors should be able to squeeze them out.

This game disappointed me, perhaps because I expected too much of it.
The map and graphics are really nice, though.
I feel that something is missing. The historical narrative, the events of the period, ... 

Two games played as Caesar and replayability seems weak.
As Caesar, you have to take the initiative and be aggressive, otherwise Pompey wins easily. Pompey can just wait and take the cities in Orient (Byzantium, Ephesus) to keep his advantage.
Caesar can try to take the cities in Hispania or even Rome, but that's easier said than done, especially with the Divine Intervention cards (defection, step losses, ...). It's probably a good idea to go towards Athens and Byzantium to take over Pompey's possessions.

The game mechanics are good and quite simple but it's a very "dry" game. The use of the navy is very important to transport quickly troops. Cards add a little unpredictability.

The game is not bad but I did not really enjoy it. I guess this kind of game is not for me.

Probably would not want to invest in shipping to trade for this. However, I'd consider it as part of a multi-game trade or something like that. LOW Priority.

I rank it a 7, because it is fun and a step above Quebec 1759 in depth and complexity. It's not a particular area of historical interest, but it's interesting enough to get me to play.

I'm not sure I like the event cards in this one as much as in Hammer (which is almost the same game, frankly, but with kilts.) In my one game of this, three of the five turns ended abruptly due to simultaneous event cards being played. That made for a short game and an anticlimactic ending (note that this turned out to be a mistakenly executed rule, so I'll have to play again to adjust my opinion accordingly.)

I'm not sure I like the theme of the gods intervening, or is that just window dressing for "random" events. I don't know. In any case, the events seem overpowered to me.

Taken as an entry-level war game, Julius Caesar  works very well. I would happily teach this game to a newbie to whet their appetite for war gaming. It plays fast and cleanly. The system is elegant, rather chess-like, in its simplicity and introduces just enough key war gaming concepts such as concentration of forces, capturing objectives, limited intelligence, reinforcements/replacements, varying combat engagement capability as well as land and naval warfare as to bring a newbie a light feel for the campaign. You won’t find this a treatise on the Civil Wars and with the great depth found in other games which are simulations.

This is a light game to be played in a short space of time first and foremost with enough flavor and theme for the entry level player or those who want a light experience that won’t overload you with details. On that level, I think it absolutely hits the mark very well. The odds really seem stacked with Caesar if you play out the full 5 turns so although the pressure is on for the him to attack, it seems like a bit of early luck could steal a victory for Pompey but it seems like a tough ask. Must keep playing to find out for sure. The combat system is very simplified but works very nicely as does the levy system. The hidden information due to not knowing the actual combat strengths until combat is declared is a very nice feature which adds a good level of suspense. Ok, the Gods event cards seem random but war has a sense of being funny that way and the unexpected does happen, so call it the fortunes of war. The rebellion rule is a nice touch as is the Cleopatra changing sides rule so you can never totally hedge your bets. The small components quibbles mentioned earlier don’t detract from the experience but keep this from being nearer a perfect game.

Overall, Julius Caesar is a lot of fun and a great way to have a war game experience in a short space of time without the work needed to play a more detailed simulation. As my time is at a premium, this fits nicely with what I am able and willing to play often. Definitely recommended as a great introduction and I look forward to playing more block war games.

This is definitely the superior block wargame from Columbia. The decision matrix is significantly more complex (based in part because of the the nature of the map) and the movement and support rules make for nailbiting choices and close fights.

Sigh. Why is duration proportional to complexity with these block wargames? While this is shorter than Hammer of the Scots, it's also not as nuanced, so I end up with the same problem: with about half an hour to go, the game starts to feel routinized and dull. There's less of a push-pull repetitiveness since the Wintering Phase is not as drastic, but that also eliminates some of the tactical richness of laying traps for your opponent. As with its older sibling, overarching strategies for each side seem somewhat scripted, and the breadth of tactical options is mitigated by the cards you draw. Ultimately, I'm glad I tried it, and I'm willing to play if someone else has it. But it's not a keeper for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very entry-level (but clever) game about the Cesar-Pompey civil war, culminating with the battle of Munda (45 BC) and the end of the Republic.
Units are wooden blocks activated with cards (commands and events) on a point-by-point map: the map can be a little over-crowded sometimes (those blocks are BIG) but this is a minor complaint, and it's a common mark of Columbia's block wargames.
Battles are fought rotating the blocks to simulate wounds, and since they are printed only from one side, there is a nice fog of war effect. Lots of fun. Anyone can play this - and should. 
An alternative could be the magazine game [i]Roman Civil War[/i] (S&T #165)

UPDATE: having just playing HotS, R3, and now JC, the latter is growing in my opinion. Gameplay is exceedingly tight and chess-like. Very impressive!

Simple, elegant, very little chrome, almost a throwback to dares of yore CG design. The Roman player REALLY has to rush some cities in the first few years to avoid being shut out. Good, clean fun, even if it doesn't have the sparkle or sizzle of R3. More plays will tell.

Count me as another who HATES the god cards in major way...not the text, just the names. And in this day and age, is a mounted mapboard really too much to ask? The one for this game just seemed flimsy and cheap.

I LOVE THIS GAME!  Easy to learn but has a lot of depth and decisions to make each turn.  Each player feels the pressure and the map is a lot more open than Hammer of the Scots.

RATING: 9
Rules are similar to Hammer of the Scots, Crusader Rex, or Richard III, with fewer exceptions or "wrinkles". That makes it a bit easier to learn or teach the game. On the other hand, the game appears as deep as the aforementioned titles. There are a lot of difficult decisions facing both players, as neither side has enough units, movement points, or build points to accomplish all they want. And naval/amphibious movement ensures that the game remains wide open, with many avenues of attack. Overall, Julius Caesar looks like a winner. (Note: when teaching the game, let the inexperienced player have Pompeius - Caesar has a tough time consolidating his power base during the first year.)

Update: rating improved from 8 to 9. This is my favorite of the A-B-C series of Columbia games.

This is light block war game. Very low rule comlexity, but game are really deep and full of strategy.

Looking forward to buy Crusader Rex and Napoleon Waterloo campaign 4th becouse of JC.

Too muck luck-dependent and too few significant strategical and tactical choices.

Sometimes ten or more throws of dice are needed for a single  battle: instead of throwing the dice I could have spent my time better in some of my preferred games that continuously offer the player significant and tense choices and not just a few. For me it is much more exciting if the results of a game are based on the way people play and not on luck with dice and/or cards.

If you have my same taste (look for example at my top ten) you probably better avoid this game. Otherwise you could still consider to try it. In its genre (that is not my cup of tea) it is one of the best.

A very straightforward block-based wargame about the first Roman revolt (by the titular Julius Caesar).

My only real complaints are: 1) That the map could stand to be a lot bigger to accommodate all the nice, big blocks and allow the players to still be able to see the roads and towns clearly, and 2) The Caesar player starts the game at a tremendous disadvantage! Although it is possible to recover from such a weak starting position, a first-time player will struggle to win the game playing as Caesar, whereas his opponent will have no such difficulty.

For me, Columbia has been on something of a roll of late. I really enjoy [b]Texas Glory[/b] and [b]Richard III[/b]. And [b]Julius Caesar[/b] has done nothing to change my opinion. After admittedly limited play, it seems very tight and balanced, with enough period chrome to keep me in the proper "mood" if you will. Due to time constraints, I find that anything much more complex than Columbia's brand of history just doesn't get the playing time, so I am very happy with JC. If anything I feel my rating may go up with more play. Good Job!

Very fun, well-done game. Have played twice and both games were closely fought and came down to late moves and battles to determine the winner.  With various strategies for play, seems very replayable. The "event" cards are fun, but I do wish they were based on real history and not on the whim of gods.  There are a lot of difficult decisions to make in the game as to allocating resources or moving and attacking.  Looking forward to playing again.

This is probably one of the best Columbia Games block war games. It may be the easiest to learn, which would make it an ideal entry point for new players. Artwork and graffic layout is well done. Interesting decisions are rampant here, as is tense game play. Lots of dice rolling, though.

RATING: 8
This is a game that gains while playing. It's a splendid system that suffers from the Event Cards. I have no problem with the god's theme, they just make the game too random.

Especially the Jupiter card can spoil a whole year of preparation - get fleet and legions in position, then your opponent snatches one of your big legions costing you four steps adding four to his own account - that is HUGE! Vulcan can also be a decisive killer. OTOH drawing too many Events in a Year can leave you helpless or crippled in the long run because you fall back too much on build-up (I have seen drawing four of them in one Year and three the next - when this happens chances for victory are minimal).

Although I hate house rules and having to mess around with given games (this is the job of the playtesters), this game was clearly worth to try to turn it to our tastes. So we implemented a house rule that a player has just to keep one of the Event cards per year (surplus ones can be replaced after showing them). Didn't solve the Jupiter problem. Removing this card from play still didn't turn out to be salvation, so we tried for something radical:

We play the game without those cards. 

Now the game is really interesting, almost chess-like. In the long run the removal of the Event Cards could lead to a game with too less variability, but this will take so many games that I'll be satisfied with the fun I had once reaching that status.

So currently I rate this game with a solid 8 when played w/o Events - I'd rate it 5 when played out-of-the-box.

In both cases it could be a one grade better, but the board is rather flimsy and not functional. I had to use permanent marker to write positions of levy units onto the bord, and I also marked (with arrows), where the ports are located (not to know which sites are important for levy or to have to search for those little fleet symbols covered by even small stacks of blocks before winter comes made game-play really cumbersome).

Now the map is functional, but it isn't really pretty anymore. The game has a lots of strategic and tactical possibilities!

I have actually now played this game a couple of times. I found it fun and easy to teach and both my games were nail biters.

Although two plays is hardly a large enough sample for a full analysis, I can see multiple strategies to be tried: a quick attack on Rome and attempt to hold the capitol and the neighboring cities, try to kill the enemy generals, make multiple assaults on cities throughout the Mediterranean, control the seas and prevent your opponent from going where he wants to go, etc. This appears to be a rich and varied game.

This is my favorite of all the block games.  It is easy to play and does not take long to play.  There is a lot of back and forth action and a lot of strategy.  The fleets really add a lot of options.  The game is also fairly even with maybe a slight tilt toward Pompey.  If you like the Columbia block games do not miss this one.

Another solid offering from Columbia. One of the lighter titles that plays fast with the familiar rules set. Both sides play a card then resolve movement before battle. Armies move from city to city along roads (one or two blocks for dotted-line roads, up to four for solid-line roads). No stacking limits in cities until winter when the largest city (Rome) can support five blocks, and the smallest cities can house three blocks.

For the amount of wood/cardboard that is in the box, this was an expensive game to buy. I'm glad I did though - I've enjoyed it a great deal thus far. For an asymmetric game it seems to be well-balanced and I have seen a number of different strategies prove victorious - all of which bodes well for the game's replayability. Different to anything else in my collection and appeals to my historical interest. A really nice game.

Great block game.  The map and water options give so much variability and movement options to this game -- it seems like there are many, many ways that it can play out, unlike other games of the genre.  My only complaint is that the god cards seem a little too important.  I'd like to try modifying the deck a little bit to maybe reduce the number of god cards and reduce their impact a little.

Mechanics are straightforward, especially if you've played any of Columbia's Hammer of the Scots system games. Low unit density, desperate maneouver, and tense battles. Real hammer and tongs stuff.

But there's a surprising amount of historical flavour.  Levy locations, subtle differences in force pools, and the initial deployment make for a nicely assymetrical situation. And games tend to come down to the wire.

Bumped my rating to a 9 for replayability.

Good, fun game. It has taken us a while to work out how to play Pompey well, but he finally had a win last night (6th play). Nice simple combat system and movement process. The map is pretty but a little too small for the size and number of the blocks (and it could do with being mounted as well).

Meines Erachtens besser noch als Einstieg in Blockgames geeignet als z.B. "Hammer of the Scots". Asymmetrische Ausgangspositionen (Caesar MUSS angreifen - aber wo?, Pompeius KANN abwarten, aber sollte sich um die maritime Vorherrschaft bemühen).

Hammer of the Scots I admired as a designed, but the play always felt all choked up. JC: awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very pleasing asymmetric strategic wargame. Caesar starts with significantly more military strength, while Pompey starts with significantly more victory point cities (and is closer to additional neutral VP cities to grab them more easily). So the burden is on Caesar to attack.

For our first few games, Caesar was losing horribly, but as we gained experience, both sides seem to have similar chances of victory, and some games have been very dramatic and exciting. Despite the fixed historical setup, every time has played out interestingly differently, and there are various strategies to try out.

The only caveat is that ships seem more powerful/necessary than I would expect/prefer (and a huge fleet can even attack and capture a lightly defended coastal city with no help from any attacking land units), but my opinion may evolve on that. (I don't know enough about the war - perhaps this is historically accurate.)

Good simple rules with very little fiddly chrome. Probably quite suitable as an intro/newbie block wargame for an experienced gamer interested in trying a wargame. Certainly a good first block wargame for any wargamer interested in block wargames. Easily playable in 2 or 3 hours max, but also can end sooner, e.g. we had a game end after the 1st year (of 5 years).

-----

After 17 plays, the game continues to show its good replay value (and we've still only played with the historical fixed setup) and remains quite fun and interesting. So I'm increasing my rating from 8 to 9. In terms of fun, excellent clear rules, and playability in an evening, this is a great block game.

Looks pretty darn generic to me, but plays smoothly and is pretty balanced--I like games with more symmetric powers, like this one. As much as I admire this smooth gameplay, I think a little more chrome would have made this one a classic!

The event cards could be more various and inspiring. Since you have to garrison your holdings, it seems hard to build armies much and the naval sector hinges upon a few units, yet seemingly has a great impact. Cleopatra also seems exceedingly weak and doesn't grant you local control unless you have a unit babysitting her.

This war is begging for a grand CDG!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Plays differently to HoS and Richard III. Where HoS see saws between offensive play and defensive play, and Richard III is a three turn buildup, JC is not as scripted in comparison. You can spend much of the game fighting over Rome in a multi-year battle of attrition, or take the fight to the East or West. Games vary more and as such with the simple rules and shorter playing time it'd be my first choice as a block game off the shelf between the three.

With no home territories the units are a lot more free to roam and there's a lot more fog of war with the block types and strengths. I like the point to point movement, the levies built into the cards, and the geographical quirks of straits and multiple sea major ports. Control of the seas varies from turn to turn and you find yourself planning to make the most of it as the next year it could be a different story.

With actions and levies built into the cards they are varied and balanced and make each hand interesting with timing, setting up moves and patience when using god cards. All in all an excellent block game and I'd recommend this as the first to try if you want to get into them.

This is another nice addition to the Columbia block gaming tree.  There are some nice new elements introduced here, particularly the Levy addition to the cards.  I also like the need to keep a unit in a city to maintain control and allow new reinforcements, which prevents a big stack from just pushing through each  VP city.  The battles are pretty much the same as other titles so you can get going very quickly if familiar with the Columbia block system.

I think the map really makes the game play well, having roads linking cities rather than areas like other block games.  The setup really forces the Caesar player to get going to avoid an early defeat.  
The setup also creates a good environment for multiple paths to victory which is nice initially but not so sure long term it creates good replay value.

With virtually no relation to the history of Caesar's Civil War, this block wargame has the theme pasted on like a euro game. However, it's also incredibly fun. The possibility of bold amphibious manoeuvres and truly powerful cards creates a lot of tension and chaos.

1 play so far, very promising.  I think this is going to be a favorite.  Knocking 1 off the rating for the cramped map.

A couple more plays and this still shows a lot of promise (played with different newbies everytime).  I wish the map showed where each side can recruit - people new to the game, myself included, have a lot of trouble working out what to do at in the first years.  Final years always end in a mad scramble for VPs.

I was leary because the production quality is severely lacking especially at the asking price. The map is a thin piece of paper and drab to look at, the blocks seem oversized and the card art is not much better... but gameplay is brilliant! The game feels fresh and plays smoothly. Who's attacking really matters and the fog of war in both card-play and blocks provides uncertainty -- is that Caesar with the 13th legion, or just a couple of auxilia, and is he going to Athens before I do? Caesar has the military edge but Pompey could knock Caesar out in one round if Caesar is too cautious. Lots of strategic subtlety to be gotten in subsequent plays.

This game actually plays in 90-120 minutes. Setup and clean-up is quick. Rules overhead is minimal. Battle system is fun. My favorite game for 2 hours.

RATING: 8
It has the simplest rules of the Hammer-likes, but I miss the lack of Chrome. It adds naval forces into the mix. I dislike the map due to there not being enough room for blocks where they don't cover up necessary info. I prefer the area style movement over point-to-point in these styles of games. Hard for a beginner to win as Caesar. Perhaps more plays will dispel this notion, but it seems that the opening moves are scripted which I dislike, though the game does open up past that.

Meh, I think I'm just not a fan of these block war games in general. Map is too damned small for these huge blocks. Battles are long, cumbersome and mostly decision-free.

But heck, don't take my word for it. Everyone else here seems to think this game is awesome sauce.

Moj omiljeni 2 player. Ova igra je na visokoj razini apstrakcije istinitija od vijesti na TV. I ima možda najbolju mapu ikad. Ipak, bitna je stvar da je tmeatski posve promašeno nazvati evente po bogovima. Nikad tako nisma ni igrao, od prvog dana sam igrao sa inačicama karata koje ne nalaze u sekciji /files , sa vojno-političkim temama. Ipak je to građanski rat i samrtni hropac republike, pa nekako Epidemija ima smisla a Vulcan nema, isto kao i Suprise Strike a ne Mars ili Turncoat a ne Mercury. Sve izgleda prekrasno, rulebook je među bolje napisanima _uopće_, a struktura mape i jedinica, i njihove međuigre jel u manevru, novačenju ili bitkama je savršena. Neki prigovaraju na upotrebu kockica, no premda bi se dalo ubaciti CRT, kockica je hendalan na dobar stari način da se toliko baca da se nivelira. Ovo je wargame a ne igra na sreću, tu je kockica alat a ne smisao; nema mi gore nego kad igram nekaj 5h, i bacim kockicu ukupno 20 puta od čega 15 bude loše. Ovdje u max 2h baciš kockicu zilijun puta i, premda se nekad čini da nije tako (pogotovo ako gubiš), razdioba je 1/6 svako lice. Ha sad neku bitku prođeš bolje neku gore, ali ako ne gubiš glavu sve se to dugoročno nivelira pa pobjedu ipak odnosi strategija.

JC is often compared to another game by Columbia Games, [thing=3685]Hammer of the Scots[/thing]. The comparisons are understandable, but you can say that about a lot of block war games released by Columbia. They all use a similar movement and combat system. They are all card based. They are all increasingly designed to be played in a few hours or less. There are exceptions (e.g., [thing=101118]Borodino 1812[/thing]), but the popular system that Columbia crystalized with Hammer is here to stay.

I enjoyed this more. The play is more dynamic because there isn't any mid-board choke point. The sea movement also really opens up play, adding both surprise and tension. While many blocks games of older design feel like a slog (with leaders switching sides and boards that leave little room for creativity), JC is comparatively brisk. Launching my troops across the ocean is exciting. Fighting a pitched sea battle to prevent future troop movement feels consequential. Brooding over a loss in a battle that probably wasn't necessary feels thematic.

Play is quick, decisive, and most of all tense. Some people complain that the god cards are ahistorical. Perhaps, but only if you assume they actually represent godly intervention. To me they feel thematic from a historical point of view. Serendipitous and/or terrible things happen in war. Many Romans would have explained these events through their religion even if there was a less mystical, perfectly reasonable, explanation. That the game chooses to adopt the stance of the Romans is fine by me.

I like the simplicity of this game.  I dislike the god cards, however.  I strongly disfavor games that need a "house rule" to make the enjoyable, but I do not see myself playing this without adjusting the way the deck is reshuffled each round.  We tested it with shuffling every other round and that felt much less random and more strategic in the play.  With the current rules I rate JC as a 7, but with the deck variant we tried I lean closer to a 7.5 or 8.  I need to play it more.

RATING: 8
This game clearly deserves the high esteem in which it is held.  Like all Columbia block games, this one stands as a unique game, even while clearly being derivative from the others in the family (primarily Hammer of the Scots). There are lots of twists to take the essential characteristics of the period and the specific conflict and make the game about that struggle and those dynamics, rather than just a re-themed version of the same game. Easy to jump into if you know the system, but with its own feel and personality.

I really wish production quality could be improved to match that of others. Seems like they sell enough and they certainly charge enough. The original Gamma 2 Games block games (Quebec) originally had mounted boards, or so I've heard, and were treated as boutique items for discerning gamers.... what happened?

COLUMBIA: You guys clearly pack the boxes to order, so why can't you get a supply of "deluxe" mounted boards to keep around and offer it as an upgrade option! Just a few. If they sell out, the idea is a success and you can invest more into larger prints, if they don't then you know the demand isn't there (but, trust me, look around BGG, the demand IS there). I am not a paper map grog who has sheets of Plexiglas waiting in the wings for when I want to pull these out and making them lie flat is a pain. Plus, it just makes the games feel cheaper than they are, and the price isn't cheap. Simmons Games and Histogames are also smaller publishers, yet their games cost the same or less and honestly are about an order of magnitude higher in production quality. Just saying... 

OK, rant over. Soap box disengaged. Love the game, in any case.

This is a great strategy game with simple rules and great mechanics. Plus the game plays in 2-3 hours and there is rush to do things and choose other things that you will not try to pursue. A lot of strategy! I am not a war gamer, and still I find this design very attractive. I have tried Quebec and Athens/Sparta from Columbia. Both these games were not good for me, but Julius is a great game that most likely will make me get Hammer of the Scotts. If you like games like Stone Age, Ticket to Ride, and you have fun with games like Memoir 44, then get your copy of Julius Caesar now!

Another excellent Columbia block game.  While the game is very simple to play, there are multiple strategic paths for both sides to consider.  Most of the units are rated fairly accurately, even though I think that Metellus Scipio is a beneficiary of the need for a balanced game.  Area-specific legions are a good chrome feature.  My initial play suggests that Caesar might have a slight edge, but that seems historical given the terrible command structure on Pompey's side.  This game is fun, only takes a couple of hours, and it is one that I would definitely be willing to play again.

An excellent war game with simple mechanics that do a remarkable job of giving the feel of the entire civil war. However, the luck of the dice mixed with the luck of the cards is a tiny bit high (though, again, accurately reflecting the period), the game is a little long, and I'm not sure of the replayability after a while. It all boils down to: I would not be as likely to play this as many of the other excellent war games that exist, even Though I love the theme of this one.

This is my first block wargame, and it's fantastic! The rules were easy to understand, and the game is really tense, especially when it comes down to Caesar needing to win a close battle for a city in order to not lose the game. I feel like there's a lot of strategy to be had in this game, despite the relatively simple mechanics.

Columbia Block game. Interesting period. Seems balanced but I have had success with Pompey more often. I think the better wargamer should play the Caesar side. Good artwork. Box art actually improved over time between pre-order and actual production. Good re-play value.

fun block war game; high level depth of the game and the fog of war aspect become more apparent with more plays;  pleasant looking pieces and board;  good option for beginner wargamers; leads to interest in more even complex wargames I would think

Not a particularly strategic game, but I'm biased against all block games that aren't Sekigahara. I'm 0/3 on Columbia games, so I probably won't pursue a fourth.

Owned this game for years, I still enjoy it. It doesn't get boring like most light wargames, since it's deep strategy wise.  Very intelligent design. Bumping rating to 10, this game is perfect for what it is and is now in my top ten games.

Pricey, but wood parts, map kinda of flimsy. First and my only block game.

Not sure I want to go anywhere deeper into "war" games then this entry level war game. Or is that Civil War game.

Anything past this starts to get to messy, finicky, rule laden, long playing.

This is a fine example of owning just one block war game. Love the sea/water aspect. Tough to find people to play it.
You might consider finding a chess player or stratego player. 

This is what stratego should be.

In my last play Pompey tried to deal a quick decisive blow but lost the battle of Massilia and was forced to retreat to Rome and later Sicilia. The agression of Pompey had already prompted Caesar to campaign in Asia Minor where he lost a battle and fell to Vulcan. Pompey in turn made the mistake to ignore Neptune's help and subsequently lost Alexandria to a surprise naval attack. Patiently rebuilding an army in Sicilia he moved onto Rome for a last ditch assault, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat when the defensive ballista misfired but his elephants didn't. Not the most serious wargame but an exciting one that reliably plays in two hours (can be shorter if Caesar isn't careful).

A blockwargame. This covers a bigger area in wich you need to hold city's for a value of 10 points. This makes it similar to some strategie games. 

Nice

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#009900]2P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Short and sweet low complexity block wargame with very streamlined rules.

RATING: 6
Only 3 plays

The Good:
Good gameplay
Quick set-up
Very simple rules
Great introductory game
2-3 hours playtime
Good replayability

The Bad:
Probably just personal flavour but this doesn't click with me in the way that other Columbia titles have done. But I can see what other people like about it.

 Just returned from Prezcon 2011...I played this game a lot!

I have to say... this is an extremely well balanced game..
with extremely high replay value. I highly recommend this
game!

Best Columbia block game, IMO. The map is constrained which leads to confrontations earlier on than most block games in my collection. This is a good thing.

Good block game that hearkens back to Napoleon.  Card play makes things interesting but historically asymmetric.  A good addition to the lighter series of CG block games.

Solid block game on the Caesar V Pompey war. Colourful map, nice pieces. Interesting choices to make. Can see it will take more plays to grasp the naval side of things.

First rate components. Easy to learn. Very well balanced. Plays quickly, so that you can get in two or three games in an evening. I think it is Columbia's best yet.

Julius Caesar is an excellent choice for hobbyists new to block wargaming.  Movement and combat are straightforward, emotions run high, and there are no sieges, odd hex control rules, supply lines, or finicky rules exceptions and details to clutter things up.

General thoughts on gameplay:

Sea control is a conundrum, since it's both critically important and extremely fragile.  Pompey gets flayed without it, and yet sea dominance often boils down to a 1-on-1 or 2-on-1 battle between paper-thin ship units.

Movement is simultaneously plodding (attacks must be adjacent) and freeform (sea movement).  The former means that attacks are clearly telegraphed, but the latter shakes things up and keeps players on their toes.

Local recruitment of blocks is a fresh approach, although it could lead to scripted openings.  After all, the sooner you summon your überunits to the board, the faster you can build them up.

The eastern half of the board is a dangerous frontier.  It's wide open and fancy free, and I suppose I wouldn't have it any other way.

Finally, Julius Caesar includes a big elephant block that will sit on you and smash you dead.  That's just neat.

Conclusion:

It's no mean feat that JC manages to appeal to both amateur and experienced block devotees - in contrast to games like War of 1812 that are ultimately too simplistic to have long-term staying power with hardcore fans.

I like the game, and I'm glad I bought it.  If both sides prove to be equally balanced, this could be widely popular - although Columbia diehards may want to try-before-buying just to be sure that there is enough new game content to warrant a purchase.  For newcomers, the game unreservedly gets a big thumbs up.

[i]Update:[/i]

Players should be aware that it is possible for Pompey to win outright in the first year (!) - even without Rome - if Caesar doesn't annex and hold at least one eastern city.  Take heed!

The fun parts of the game aside - and there are many - the fact that a first-year win is possible is at least a minor design error.  It isn't easy to accomplish, necessarily, but no introductory wargame should put newcomers in a position where they can lose in 20 minutes to an experienced player.  This doesn't spoil the game, by any means, but it does dampen my enthusiasm a bit.

I think this game is a little gem! Very well done indeed from a new designer. After the disappointment of  "Athens and Sparta" I was going to write off block games
from my collection. But somehow, as I watched the development of this game I decided to pre-order and I'm glad that I did. This is a very good game and an excellent one for tournament play. Congrats, Justin, very well done.

Julius Caesar is an awesome 2-player wargame. It's full of tension, and while mostly tactical, you can certainly have a strategy from the outset.

The mixture of simple rules, beautiful and very functional blocks, make this an instant classic. Sure the map would have been better as a mounted board, and I could've lived with it being a bit larger. The game should also have come with some player aids, and reference for set-up and levying. All these are available from 3rd parties.

Good game after you get through the rules, took two plays to get the kinks out. I enjoyed the battles and how cards worked (move/levy). I do not think the game is priced accurately at $60+. The game board is very cheep and thin not thick like most traditional game boards. The blocks are decent, but for $60+ I was expecting plastic engraved blocks like the new Confusion: espionage game uses. The rule book could have been colored and had some screen shots for examples of setup and game play. The city names are hard to read, especially if you are the player that has to read the names upside down. I would not be able to play this game with my father because the print is so small. It would have been nice to have individual player aids as well. Finally although it was played only two times while I had it Cesar always lost. I think if you don't have a good understanding of the game and you are Cesar this is common.

Columbia is at its best when it focuses itself on playability & fun. Easy to learn, fast playing, providing more strategical options than HoTS or Liberty. Shouldn't be regarded as sophisticated historical simulation. But provides a fantastic and tense gaming experience.

It's a fun game, but I don't believe the block mechanic is a realistic portrayal of armies that can see each other rambling on from miles away.

Also, why no sieges?

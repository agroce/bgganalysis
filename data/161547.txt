RATING: 7
Timeline: Americana is a nice mix of themes suitable for a wide variety of people, and it fits well with the American History set. The Timeline series is a very light, quick game with a broadly appealing core mechanism -- organization. The art on the cards is fantastic, and though it's essentially a trivia game ("when did this event happen?"), you need only know the answer relative to other events so you've always got a chance. Mixing the sets is a common and effective approach.

These are fantastic for nongamers. Very quick and easy to learn and play. I often have students come in and play them at lunch time. Hopefully some of the info will stick, too!

Covers 1507-2011.  Deck midpoint is 1940.  Less than 15% occurs before 1865.

Contains about 7% reprints from earlier sets.  Americana is far more focused on the 20th Century than American History, with more focus on business, art and sports.  Of all the sets, Americana has the most emphasis on the early 20th Century.

Understand why these are all over Target and the like, but can't imagine I'll break it out often.

RATING: 8
It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

And since you can mix up all the different sets, replay value is still there. Or can you remember over 500 dates? :D

RATING: 3
I originally bought it for my US history classes to help them place events in history. Thought the idea of not having to know exactly when something happened was great. Tried it out with my family and they liked it somewhat. This set has more pop culture than American History set. Problem, though, is that there are mistakes with some of the dates (about 10%). Some mistakes are not too bad (off 1 year or so) but some are way off. Totally replaced by Timeline Challenge which makes the game more fun and more challenging. I have added these cards to Timeline Challenge.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2015)

I have always liked Timeline, but I was a bit wary about this title because it seems directed only at an American audience, still we had fun playing it so I will keep it and I plan to mix it with the other timelines. Now I will also buy the American history one to see how it goes.

I think Timeline is a great trivia game, with a very short playtime. I almost always want to play it. I also think Timeline can be a good educational tool and it is almost free of language dependence as the art depicts so well what the cards are about.

On the bad side, this is the third Timeline copy I have in which The Teddy Bear card appear, I really dislike having repeat cards in my Timeline collection. I always mix all of them.

I’m getting tired of the whole Timeline series of games. My desire to play them is decreasing, so I’m downgrading its rating accordingly.

Being an Australian, this set of cards is very difficult to play and therefore much less fun. I simply don't know enough about American history and culture and it becomes almost a luck based guessing game rather than more educated estimating.

Put the cards depicting different icons or events of American identity into the right spots on the developing time line based on the year of their debut: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but you will be getting taught by the game as to a bunch of dates you do know. Hard ONLY if you're not American (and therefore not as familiar with some dates in American history). Still very fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The only downside is still that you'll eventually know the cards and have to mix in other sets.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with good involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards

Fun, even if you don't know your history. Unfortunately this game suffers from few typos, maybe fixed in recent edition.

I'm not sure how great a "game" it is, but it can be a wonderful experience. The entire table talks about the events and what they remember about them, as well as how they decided to place the event where they did. A fun time on the table for sure... with the right group.

I just didn't care much for this timeline set, so I rate it 1 point below the others. Random trivia, mostly about popular culture, doesn't particularly interest me, especially when (of course) it is strictly American popular culture. How are Brits like us supposed to know detail about baseball players and so on?

i like the Timeline games - they are fun to set up and play spontaneously, and work for almost any type of person and level of experience.  

this particular set i find to be quite difficult -  so i enjoy it less than the American History or Inventions sets.

This is a good alternative for those who like the idea of timeline but who feel more comfortable playing with dates from American sports, movies, and popular culture.  Since the pop culture items are more familiar, it feels easier than many of the other Timeline versions.

2-8 players try to place their event cards in the right place on the timeline in the center of the table. First person to get rid of all their cards is the winner, but the gaps between years to place cards shrink as the game goes on.

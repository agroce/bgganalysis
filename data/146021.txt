RANK: 45

RATING: 9.6
Time to quit being nostalgic about Arkham Horror and admit that this one simply does it better. All of the rule tweaks from Arkham are improvements and the rulebook is hands down the best I've ever seen. Still, a little too easy to win for my taste. Recommended by, seriously, everyone, and for good reason.

"A story with Lovecraftian elements, not a Lovecraftian story" is rather apt, as is a comparison to Indiana Jones in that it's less horror and more worldly romp. I'm not after a game that is specifically an Arkham game, so much as that thematic universe. To that end, this fits marvelously well. Yes, you throw dice constantly (and it's that unfortunate form of "decide first, random after"), but thats not the point. Eldritch Horror is an interesting exploration game with a decent narrative and story (which was my driving factor); one where an actress go to the gym to work out (increase strength rolls) and then buy a double barreled shotgun to eradicate monsters and close gates or we're headed toward victory and then my partner's dark pact comes due, and she turns and stabs me (a reformed cultist) and feeds me to the monsters while she romps off to (a shared) victory. Somewhat group dependent; I didn't particularly feel there was much down time, but I valued the story that was created (even if it wasn't necessarily similar to the stories, ymmv). We read encounters to each other, only reading the bits that were relevant to tell the story and getting into character when possible. Music, lighting, and people getting into it is what really drives EH. To that end, it needs the first expansion to break up the limited cycling of cards (which really hurts the narrative aspect). 

Overall, no regrets, even if it's not something I'd want to play constantly. In some ways, Mansions of Madness (2nd edition in particular) scratches a similar itch, but it's different. Comparatively, EH is less thematic in it's presentation and representation, includes less tension or intimacy with it's subject, but has the potential to be much more emergent than MoM2e does with it's limited (and driven) scenario count. Eldritch Horror has the serious potential to go the distance for tons of plays, where as MoM2e doesn't.

One of my strongest 6s/weakest 7s.

I've only played a couple of rounds but it feels very similar to Arkham, though I am by no means an expert. If you like Arham you will like this game, and if you don't, then you probably won't like this one either.

If you have ever so much as pronounced "Cthulu", you need this game.  A slightly lighter weight version of Arkham horror, this game is still rich and complex and very Lovecraftian.

There's much to love about the game, starting with it's overall look and feel.  All of the parts are sturdy and of high quality construction, while also being beautifully designed and colorful.  This is one of the few games (perhaps along with Cataan) that we enjoy setting up almost as much as playing.

Once you're into game play, EH becomes very immersive.  First, there are all the characters complete with back-stories, special attributes and personalities.  Then there are all of the monsters against which intrepid investigators must fight.  Pulled from the pages of Lovecraft, there's something satisfying about challenging these Ancient spawn, even when you lose (which will be often: see below).  Finally, there's the necessity for co-operative play -- a mechanic of which my family is particularly fond.

Even with all of the positives ahead, do not undertake EH lightly.  Set up alone can take 30 minutes or more, particularly when players draw out character selection and team balancing.  Second, there are multiple steps and actions for each player per turn, often resulting in events that may, themselves, take multiple steps to resolve.  Then there are all of the missions players must fulfill before they get the chance to face the big boss.  If I can sum it all up in a word to describe the game, it's this: long.

And what's a long game worth if it's not also… hard!  How hard?  Well, players in this game often DIE, as in dead -- no longer able to function and lose all the stuff you just spent an hour accumulating -- dead.  Sometimes players get the pleasure of dying twice having taken up the fight in the form of another investigator.  

For some, the thought of playing a game for hours that they are very likely to lose just doesn't sound attractive.  I can understand.  If you're not rewarded by the game's atmosphere and immersion, then you're likely not to come back after your first epic beat-down.  If you stick with it, however, and just enjoy the ride, there will come a time when you are there to see an Ancient fall.  And that, my friends, is sweet, sweet nectar!

Overall, Eldritch Horror is a realistic, deeply engaging, sophisticated game that can deliver hours and hours of entertainment.  Find willing and committed gamer friends, get out some candelabras, creepy music, and plenty of snacks, and make a late night of Eldritch Horror as often as possible.

EH has a relatively steep learning curve, and set-up is longer than I prefer; however, once you get going it's an excellent experience. I love the co-op nature, the mechanics, the rush against time, the surprises, and the narrative theme. It's a long play, but each minute is great. Figuring out what to do each turn is fun for me, and having ways to adjust difficulty is appreciated as I ramped up and got smarter. After playing a few times, I still think what you get in the box is a good deal, but the card narratives get a bit repetitive. It sounds like the expansions are the cure, but that's what I'm craving next. Really great game all around.

Streamlined Arkham Horror? I must admit my first play of this went far longer than I would have thought possible... but am willing to give this +many+ more chances.

I expect my rating of this to rise over time.

[b]UPDATE:[/b] This is still a long game. While it's not as lengthy as Arkham Horror is, it's deceptively long... which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What's far more important is that it's an enjoyable experience -- even if damned frustrating at times.

Have had heads handed to us every single time it hits the table -- and it doesn't matter. It's still fun!

I am hesitant to write about this game now that I have some bad memories, but the truth is that all the wonderful narrative that has pales with the complete luck dependent of the gameplay. I am really struggling to think of any meaningful decision I make in any of the games.

Also the mechanic of constantly killing characters does not grow well on me.

Again, theme wise it is almost perfect.

I love the theme and the adventure.But it's too long and heavy for my family. Solo was good but not great for the time invesment.

A bunch of components and rules, like the train/boat tickets, mythos phase and many kind of encounters bring theme to the table but also more randomness.

Mythos phase its like a set up for every round.

At the end feels like a giant puzzle more than an adventure to fight the ancient ones.

Would pray to Cthulhu for see this system in a cleaner and quicker fashion.

O tema do jogo me fisgou, então isso pode influenciar minha nota. Apesar de ser considerado um jogo mais leve do que seu irmão mais velho Arkham Horror ainda é um jogo bem longo. Jogar com mais do que 4 pessoas é dedicar pelo menos 3 horas - o que torna esse um jogo-evento e não uma coisa para ser jogada casualmente. As regras podem assustar um "não-gamer" e é bom você ser um bom organizador de jogos se pretende jogar com gente que não conhece jogos modernos.

RATING: 6
Much to like in the art and components, but the game forces you to ignore the exploration and narrative aspects and focus on frantically trying to close gates and fight random monsters. For me that means much of the interesting theme is lost in favour of a simplistic Pandemic-like puzzle, without the elegance of that game and instead just a lot of dice rolling. The game really punishes you if you don't follow the script. All the rushing around makes the world seem unthematically small, and the rate at which clues come and go is at odds with any idea that they are precious secrets. I think there's potentially a great game here but the Arkham Horror style gameplay somewhat spoils it for me.

I played this game twice before deciding to let it go. I can see this being a game someone loves. It is thematic, the components are beautiful, and it can be a great game for the right ameritrash-lover, especially if they like Lovecraft lore. It can be funny at times, especially if you get into character. Unfortunately, it's just not for me. I felt it was a rather long and fiddly (so many components!) game with no truly interesting decisions. We never really debated about what to do, because it was largely clear. I won easily once and lost once, but it felt like it had little to do with anything but dice-rolling luck. I understand why someone else would enjoy it, but I'd only play it if someone truly wanted to.

Indiana Jones the board game.  Exploring the world, solving mysteries, collecting artifacts and eccentric allies.  This game is brutally hard, but when you win the sense of accomplishment is fantastic.  The status cards instill players with a real sense of dread, never knowing what awaits on the back of the card.  I've only played this with 2, but this game is incredible with 4 or less.  Any more and the game FAR outstays its welcome.

A game in which you can never do enough. Nothing is easy in Eldritch Horror. Just when you've put your thumb in one hole, preventing a leak, another one opens. What could easily become a frustration is tempered by the exciting pace and weird tales of Eldritch Horror. 

Frustrations give way to small victories and satisfied fist pumps when a monster is defeated or a gate is closed or a rumor is stamped out. Passing a test when your life is on the line is a burst of excitement that many games lack.

I will say that you have to be in the mood to play this game. Be ready for frustration, for bad rolls, for doom to progress when you least need it. And make sure your companions are ready for it. If there is anybody who would rather check the time on their phone than listen to an event unfold, you have a recipe for a long and bothersome game. The mood must be right. But when it is, you've got a fantastic time ahead of you.

Having played and *wanted* to enjoy Arkham Horror, but unable to get past the overwhelming components and play time, I was anxious to give this supposed slimmed down version a try. I think it delivers very solidly. The system is quite trim now - where everything (I mean nearly *everything*) is placed on the tons of card decks. So it's a sprawling mess in that way - but it's better than ten zillion tokens of it's fat brother. To be sure, there's still dozens of tokens - but it all seems more manageable. The theme sure comes through with the load of text on every item in the game - characters and encounters. Love the gooey theme for sure - FFG is better behaved, but still seems to like tossing in game-ending cards as well. But if I'm longing for what amounts to an experience game of weird horror and have about 45-60 min per player to spend, this one does it better than most.

Eldritch Horror was introduced to me as streamlined Arkham Horror which would've been great, since I like playing the latter one, but due to the enormous amount of time needed for the setup and moving the pieces around, I seldom get a chance. 

Well, Eldritch Horror wasn't exactly what I expected. Setup was still quite a chore and the game didn't move all that fast. Or should I say that the game ended fast in terms of completed rounds, but the absolute time it took was quite long. I found it quite disappointing to see that I only managed to move from Panama to New York and then to San Francisco during the 3,5 hours. Oh, I loved the story, and actually celebrated when my character died, but I wanted to do more than just to collect two clues, buy a train ticket, get ambushed by a monster, get stabbed into forehead and wake up in a unfamiliar ditch without a recollection of the events night before.

In a nutshell, the story was enjoyable but I didn't feel that I actually contributed to the outcome of the game in any significant way. The proportion of story telling and book keeping to actual playing is way off its mark here. I would play again but I would never consider buying the game knowing that it wouldn't actually get any table time. Should I have a suitable slot in my calendar, Arkham Horror would be my pick, since it has almost the same playing time but you get to do more.

Update June 2017: I remember being enamored with it, but after getting 2 expansions it became really burdensome to set it up. Haven't played it in a while...


Brilliant game. After 1 game it became my 2nd favorite game after Marvel Legendary. My girlfriend is not that fond of all the luck-dependency, though we both agree that it is cool that they've included so many possibilities to mitigate the luck-element. I've heard that the expansions solve that through the Focus action? Looking forward to playing it more and eventually getting all the expansions. Brilliant, brilliant design.

I fail to understand why FFG continually keep printing that these types of games support massive player counts. Huge amounts of downtime interspersed with even more people trying to explain the best course of action. This wasn't helped by the fact I had a character who never moved and just got cool stuff for all the other characters. I had to get a train home but I felt the group were no worse off for me not being there as it was easy to do my actions. It's a solo game masquerading as a co-op.

I also love the worldwide adventure element. Very glad to have added this to my game library. :)

Very good for multiplayer and solo play. My biggest complain is the size of the decks. The game just feels incomplete and you can come across a card more than one time per game. The game just feels lacking without the Forsaken Lore expansion, which is Out of Print in my country and has been impossible to find. I would argue that this is a game that should get a second edition with double or triple the amount of cards in the encounter and mystery decks to feel like a complete experience. Also, they only include 4 dice in the game, which is way less than you'll need. 8 dice at least should have been included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Despite being a popular game, I never liked Arkham Horror. I think it's too long and too shallow, as the game-play consists in rolling a lot of dice for a very long time. So when Eldritch Horror came along I wasn't interested, even when I heard that the design considerably improved upon its predecessor.

Yet, it's wrong to judge anything before trying it. So when I had the opportunity, I gave this game a try... and yes, it's better the Arkham Horror, but no, I still don't like it. 

Let's start with the positive aspects. First, I feel that the luck factor of the dice is mitigated way better in this game. Second, closing a portal doesn't basically mean that you skip a turn. Third, the story feels more cohesive. Fourth, I really really liked the new mechanic for Spells and Conditions where you don't know the consequences of your rolls. It's extremely thematic and makes for some very memorable moments.

At the same time, this design shows many of the same flaws of its predecessor. Eldritch Horror is again a game of rolling a lot of dice for a very long time... and I just can't get over this. Dice rolling can be a fun mechanism where it makes sense (i.e. short light games). Yet it's a sign of superficial and lazy game design, when a long complex game (like this one) relies this heavily on dice rolling. Dice rolling doesn't provide interesting decisions and that's what I would expect from a game that lasts so damn long!

Second issue... delayed. Come on! You were smart enough to realize that it wasn't fun to lose a turn in order to close a portal and then?! You put the same Monopoly mechanism back in the game design? Someone could say: "Oh, but most of the time you have the choice. You don't have to lose your turn if you don't want to." To that I say: "Yes, it's true... such a pity that the choice of not becoming delayed means usually not getting cool stuff and/or not getting to do cool stuff". I just don't understand how a modern game designer looks at its prototype and says: "You know what... let's make the player choose if they want to get bored now or later". Unbelievable.

Therefore I cannot enjoy this game. Once again FFG made a game with wonderful components and many good ideas, just to waste all of it due to some lazy game design and stubborn ameritrash mentality. This is so frustrating, because this could have really been a good game. At least Arkham had the excuse of being an older design. Eldritch Horror doesn't have any excuse. No thanks.

Delivers a strong narrative with massive replay capability. Plays in a couple of hours with fairly simple rules and a reasonable footprint (YMMV of course).

The 'reckoning' effects are excellent. What at first may appear to be a fairly minor condition or even an asset can turn sour, in some cases starting a chain of further conditions and reckonings that given time and enough bad luck eventually spirals down to catastrophe. 

The various encounter decks in the base game are quite limited and they're easy to burn through in a single session. However this is addressed by the Forsaken Lore expansion.

not without flaws, but it creates lots of fun, scaling well. I own it with 3 expansions, so I am probably blinded by seemingly endless replayability. Also I mostly play with non-hobbysts and the relatively simple mechanics together with the somehow lighthearted (I know that's the opposite of lovecraftian horror, but cmon, it s a game in which you beat up em horrors with a smile)  literary inspired theme are good and immersive enough to have the ppl I play with wanting to play again.

RATING: 9
Much more enjoyable than I was expecting: a really well thought out reworking of Arkham Horror.  Between them the two games do a decent job of covering five of my favourite 'Cthulhu' stories. AH invokes the last half of 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' and the back end of 'The Dunwich Horror': stories where some kind of New England eruption is underway.  EH invokes 'The Call of Cthulhu', 'At the Mountains of Madness', and maybe the back end of 'The Shadow Out of Time': investigation stories that piece stuff together from different places. Neither of them gets across the claustrophobic feel of 'The Whisperer in Darkness', 'The Haunter of the Dark', or 'The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'.  Both games have some out of place elements: shopping trips, Christian tropes, etc.  Those tend to pull me up more in AH, but EH isn't without them.

The link to those two great stories is certainly a reason to enjoy AH: I do prefer EH, however, for its rules, design, mechanics (double sided cards are a great rip from MoM), the strategy/ride balance, the global scope and the distinctive twist each AO brings to it. I had a lot of fun with AH, and now do the same with EH.

Update: raised the score because the expansions I've tried (the small ones) are working out well without bloat issues.

A notch below Arkham but good fun none-the-less, and quicker playing. I wish there were new characters other than the same Arkham ones, although they're done so well this is a minor complaint.

Feels a lot like Tales of the Arabian Nights as a storytelling engine rather than like Arkham Horror, strangely enough. That is, somewhat random things happen to you and you just roll with it and see what happens.

Fun even as a two player game. Thematic flare keeps us coming back.  Best Lovecraft game so far.  Succeeds where Arkham fell short.  I wouldn't recommend for new gamers unless they are big Lovecraft fans.  The reference rules are organized well and really help.  Hours of fun.

Pimped out with stands for Gates & Monsters and bought all the pre-painted figures from Fantasy Flight for the characters.

Also own the expansion: Mountains of Madness

Sold because:

- mega losowość!
- nużąca i zbyt długa rozgrywka
- brak sensu na rozgrywkę w więcej niż 3 osoby z powodu długości gry i przestoju 
- kompletny brak poczucia przygody i historii, wydarzenia są bezsensowne pod względem fabuły i nie tworzą żadnej całości
- mała ilość kart wydarzeń... szybko się powtarzają
- są chwile kiedy tura gracza jest całkowicie zmarnowana (nie wynika to z złego zaplanowania)

My favorite board game by far. I like how there are ways to mitigate the randomness of the dice. Dedicated decks for each Ancient One mean each play is themed according to your chosen foe.

I especially love how it's less fiddly than Arkham Horror!

This was a fun co-op, and I think with more plays it will go up in rating.  We lost all at once in the end, mostly due to not understanding the flow of the game.

RATING: 9
Biggest barrier to more plays is the duration, otherwise this would come out much more often. Also a prime target for a custom organizer. With no expansions, the encounter card supply is very low and you will quickly see repeats. Even if you don't get any expansions, consider adding a proxy of the Focus tokens from Strange Remnants.

RATING: 6
Lots of fun for an evening.  A co-op with an absurd set up time, but once you get moving it's easy to teach/grasp.  There's not much of a narrative, but the cards are still interesting.  I bought the first expansion but havent' needed to bust it out yet.

I'm worried that it's easier than it should be.  I'm 2-for-2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Love the narrative rich adventure. I really want to love the mechanics too. They ARE better than Arkham Horror. But the game still trips up with an annoying amount of random skill check dice rolls to determine almost everything. And when you don't succeed, the game loves to punish you by making you accomplish even less in the future.

There's also the fact that the base game has way too few cards. The expansions help. But the content is frustratingly slim without buying those.

That doesn't mean I don't like the game. It's fun when I want to play something like this. And definitely if somebody has expansions! But it's also frustrating that it isn't better.

Fun little title. More enjoyable (and euro-y) than Arkham, and plays faster too. Amazingly fun solo -- this would come to the table more often if set-up wasn't a pain (but, again, it's easier than Arkham). 

*edit: dropped from 8 to 5. 

Almost fully expanded, but has grown bloated and bland under the weight. Not a lot of cool content added to the game, and (more often than not) sessions last too long and aren't very engaging. 

Nightmare to put away too (all the little cards and bits!).

Fantastic game, and a nice mix of strategy and dice-rolling shenanigans.  Somewhat long, and does need the right group, but relatively intuitive and generally hilarious as long as people get into it at all.  Bonus points for being well-written - the Mythos is well-represented, the art is great, and the rulebook doesn't suck.  Only problem is that the research and location encounter decks are a bit spare, but Forsaken Lore more than fixes that.

Lovecraft and cooperative games here ! I could not pass on that great combo : Cthulhu + coop !!! Rules are not that complex - wanted to rate them as "simple", I find the negative way to say it really better ! - and, as long as you're willing to live an adventure - a sort of light and sometimes incoherent rpg experience -, the immersion really works...

The replaybility is quite good with the different great old ones you can fight, but the number of encoutner cards is way too small. If you add the first expansion, Forsaken Lores, you'll have the game as it should be in his base version... That's why I give it 8 : love it but forces you to buy an expansion to complete it and give it diversity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that is well thought out with a great Lovecraftian theme.
You and your team mates play as investigators/saviours that have to travel the world solving mysteries to halt the coming of the Ancient One, a godlike archdemon that will destroy the earth!

The game play works very well, player having 2 actions per turn (Move, rest, aquire assests, get train tickets etc...), then each player resolves an encounter at their location. The encounter you must perform is dependant upon what is at your location, if there is a monster you must fight it, if there is a token, you can choose to resolve it (Some are clues, some are rumours), or you can choose to resolve a random encounter card.
After actions and encounters are completed the mythos phase happens, where actions regarding demons, portals and doom counters are resolved.

I really enjoyed the game, the rules were quite easy to pick up, it was immersive and flowed very well, the only true gripe I have is the total lack of variety in encounter cards; I lost count of how many times we were each an actor in a play (You'll know the card I mean when you play the game). It seems strange to me that they've obviously taken the time to make a game that looks and plays so well then to really short change the players on encounters, especially when there is a whole phase of the turn dedicated to them. Maybe the expansions address this issue, but it's still quite cheeky to force people to buy expansions in order to have a game that feels completed.

Another adventure game set in the world of Lovecraft. I liked the quality components and the cool artwork. The condition mechanic is a clever idea and works great. 
Gameplay is quite simple. You just move on the board and draw a card to see what you found. The card instructs you to pass a test. So you roll a dice to see what happens. 

Eldritch Horror is too simple for my taste. The game is supposed to be a cooperative one but I didn't see how you can actually help the other players. Also the card descriptions are too generic and didn't grab me. I expected that this game would tell me a story like Mansions of Madness where every card has a meaning and there is a story that makes sense.

One of my absolute favorite games ever. I will play this under any circumstances. It has completely retired Arkham Horror, which was also one of my absolute favorite games. I understand and agree that player decisions are rarely informed (though they do have an impact) but the game's ability to tell a story and depict a world on the edge of destruction is unparalleled. Writing this is making me want to go play it now.

RATING: 8
I was worried that Eldritch Horror will share the same flaws as its older brother Arkham and I was surprised to see that it's completely not true. I enjoyed the game a lot and we actually won in a fairly easy game, but it was no close call, so I believe that even with nastier cards in play we'd still have a fighting chance. A game which plays from 1 to 8 player and makes sense in not common, so even though I am not a giant fan of coops, I will play this again (and thus the high rating).

Everything wrong with Ameritrash in one box.

The double-sided spell cards *are* a great, *great* mechanical implementation of 'meddling with unknown forces', but the different Old Ones (at least in the base set) didn't feel sufficiently distinct from each other (in terms of the mechanical challenges they presented) for me to feel like the theme excused your otherwise bog-standard Ameritrash "do the obvious optimal move" 'adventure game' problems. 

A truly thematic game will give me in-game, mechanical motivations to *act* differently depending on which character I'm playing, but this game is so superficial, and there is so little room for strategy [not, mind you, because of the randomness, just because the game doesn't really ask you to make tense decisions or solve problems beyond incredibly dry and usually obvious short-term logistical ones] that there is no engine beneath the veneer of narrative supposed to be driving the thing. You can't really make multiple valid decisions about how to approach the game's problems based on what YOU want to do and the expressiveness thematic games promise is thus really nowhere to be found. This would be fine if it didn't take 3 hours+ to play it, but the time:interesting problems ratio in this one is appalling.

Far too long and slow with 6 players, 3 or 4 is the optimum and the game plays very well. Enough differences to make it feel considerably different to Arkham Horror, the linking of how clues are obtained with the story works nicely. Not quite as variable with a severe lack of cards in the base set but well worth having :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a globe spanning adventure with horrific mysteries to solve and sanity-shattering forces to combat. But ...
It just cannot hold a candle to Arkham Horror for us. Despite it being wider in scope it doesn't feel as immersive. The concept of solving mysteries to accomplish your goals instead of closing gates is novel but in order to make that goal viable the game must have a timer. And the mythos deck serves that purpose. But we just do not like that timer aspect. Plus if the mystery cards get drawn in a certain order you can be stalled out quite quickly. During one game fighting Cthulhu, the epic monster corresponding to a certain mystery card came out and we were never able to defeat it. 
So while Eldritch Horror draws you into a more expansive world the gameplay, unfortunately, contracts the experience in such a way that it feels smaller somehow. 
It does however play in less time and gives you a more themtic game so it is a double-edged sword. It's best to think of Eldritch as a globe-spanning adventure and Arkham as a claustrophobic run through the haunted town.

Tras haber probado este juego me despido de mi idolatrado Arkham Horror... Este juego le supera en todos los aspectos. Reglas mas limpias y elegantes, turnos mas rápidos, objetivos y eventos basados en el primigenio al que te enfrentas, fases de mitos mas interesantes, los monstruos aleatorios propios de una región aparecen en dicha región y no en cualquier zona al azar... La lista de mejoras es inmensa y no le encuentro (de momento) ningún defecto que lo haga peor que el Arkham Horror.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Para mí una versión mejorada del Arkham horror. Corrige muchos de sus problemas pero empeora en un par de cosillas: 

El movimiento necesitaría revisarse. Teniendo en cuenta el tamaño del mapa y la necesidad de viajar por todo el mundo para resolver los misterios, encontrar pistas etc, es casi contradictorio que solo te dejen moverte de una zona a la adyacente. (O dos zonas si gastas todo tu turno en preparar el viaje y mover)

La otra pega que le veo es que le falten más cartas de encuentros, pistas, etc... No es que sea algo fundamental para disfrutar del juego pero siempre es más interesante encontrarte con sucesos desconocidos que repetir una y otra vez los mismos de siempre. La ampliación de Yig mejora muchísimo este aspecto.

Aun así me encanta, y es posiblemente uno de mis juegos favoritos. (Por lo que a mí respecta es muy probable que este juego salga más veces a la mesa que el propio Arkham Horror)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Desde mi punto de vista este juego es una evolución muy mejorada de Arkham Horror. 

Como parte positiva:

- Se trata de un juego muy narrativo, con ciertas pinceladas de rol, en el que pasan muchas cosas muy variopintas. Eso le da mucha variedad aunque la mecánica principal sea bastante sencilla y accesible a cualquier tipo de jugador.

- Corrige y evoluciona las mecánicas farragosas de AH y las resuelve en la mayor parte de los casos de forma sencilla y elegante. Como consecuencia el juego transcurre de forma mucho más fluída y ágil (aunque igual que AH no es nada corto).

- Gran calidad de producción. Buenos materiales y componentes en general.

- Si te gusta H.P.Lovecraft es el juego que en mi opinión mejor sintetiza todos los elementos de su obra (algo harto difícil). AH lo intenta también pero es mucho menos redondo.

Como parte negativa:

- Al final, si tienes poca capacidad de inmersión o no te gusta H.P.Lovecraft, el juego consiste en cerrar portales, matar monstruos y resolver las cartas de misterio con acciones más o menos rutinarias (hay muchos más detalles que a mi me apasionan, pero simplificando se trata de eso). Hay gente a la que esto le va a parecer repetitivo.

- Más que un juego es una experiencia... y muy influída por la suerte. Las tiradas son importantes y el factor suerte está muy presente. Si no salen los éxitos en los dados las cosas se torcerán. Si te gusta el control y la planificación a largo plazo... este no es tu juego.

- Algo escaso de cartas de algunos tipos. Eso se solventará con las expansiones (maldito EDGE).

- Larga duración (para mí no es un problema).

   A mi el juego me ha gustado bastante y me ha parecido divertido. Me ha sorprendido mucho su agilidad y fluidez dentro de los muchos detalles que trata de tener en cuenta.

Enjoy the theme--not Chthulu, per se, but mystery and dread as a background for a co-op game--but even with all the variety in the game, it still ultimately felt really same-y after a few plays. Lots of moving from here to there just to read a card (that you may very well have read in a previous game or that, while spooky, is fairly generic thematically). Bummer!

Have leaned more heavily on Elder Sign for this thematic feel lately--which is ironic because it is even more abstracted, but with the adjustments to that game mentioned above, it seems to be holding its own so far.

Still hoping to find a really engaging, thematic, thinky, FUN, co-op "horror" game.

Like Arkham Horror but on a global scale. It's supposed to fix a few things that didn't work well in Arkham Horror but I haven't played Arkham enough to notice those things. Going around the globe searching for clues to save the world has a nice twenties pulp movie feel to it.

I am a fan of lovecraft and the game does a fantastic job with the theme; our group always enjoys bringing it to the table but we are still rubbish at it and lose 3 out of 4 games.

We are getting better at enjoying losing and balancing the team of investigators but we still have a way to go. Played mostly with the Forsaken Lore expansion to increase the size of the decks, unfortunately this also increases the difficulty level.  Looking forward to future expansions of the game and currently considering Mountains of Madness as a purchase (love the story and it apparently reduces the game difficulty slightly). Would recommend to anyone that enjoys the lovecraft theme and difficult co-operative gameplay.

A good revision of Arkham Horror with most of the mechanics well refined, specially the investigator skills and actions, and the function of monsters, portals, clues and the items in the game. 

Length and density that Arkham had have been improved too. Eldritch is shorter and more flexible. 

The narrative of the game is well done now. The aim of the game is not to close portals anymore but to solve some narrative mysteries that depend on the old one.

The items and conditions are awesome, with some side effects that the players dont know till the right moment. Dark Pact is simply great. 

In spite of all these improvements I still love Arkham more. Eldritch needs more expansions and material. When it get them will be better than Arkham without doubt. 

-----

Una buena revisión de Arkham con casi todas sus mecánicas depuradas, especialmente las habilidades y acciones de los investigadores y el papel de los monstruos, portales, pistas y objetos en el juego.

La longitud y densidad de Arkham también han sido mejoradas. Eldritch es más corto y flexible.

La narrativa del juego está bien conseguida ahora. Ya no consiste en cerrar portales, sino en resolver cartas de misterio que dependen del primigenio.

Las cartas de objeto y condición son maravillosas, con algún efecto secundario que no se activa hasta el momento adecuado y que los jugadores desconocen. Pacto Oscuro es simplemente genial.

A pesar de todas sus mejoras, me sigue gustando Arkham más. Eldritch necesita más expansiones y material, una vez las tenga será sin duda la mejora definitiva de Arkham.

I actually never played Arkham Horror, so this was my initiation to the more serious Lovecraftian boardgames. Works pretty well solo, and also with two, though the difficulty is incredibly hard when you're not yet used to the rules, and still hard when you are. But it should be...how can you defeat these beings? Love the option to switch to different Elder God nemeses, and the length of the game gives it that epic, sinking feeling flush with the doom track. Also FFG did a superb job, this is one of the best looking games I own, and I look forward to its challenge.

I have played this game a ton and is one of my favorite games of all time.  The 10 rating is for the game with all expansions included.  On it's own, the base game is probably about an 8 with many of the expansions ranging from 7 to 8 themselves.  However, when you get a big game with everything included, this game is amazing!  

It has a nice amount of roleplay and story elements along with a bit of character advancement.  The game is decently challenging, making each game intense and enjoyable.  I have played this game so many times, I have lost count (probably around 20 to 30 times).  I have started a game with friends to finish around 10:30 at night and we each look at one another and decide to play again, going until 2:30 in the morning.

I feel this is one of the best games to capture the Lovecraftian Universe.  Games take around 2 to 4 hours to play, depending on the scenario along with about 30 minutes of setup time (I can usually do it in 15 mins due to the organization system I have set up).  I have gone out and purchased card holders for this game to make management of card decks and set up times efficient.  I am always willing to play this and don't think that will ever change.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. a story telling game (gets repetitive if you won't buy expansions but even the core box will give you hours of play). it's a hard, cruel and fun game. 
it's like pandmic legacy with more story and more surprises (only no more rules in the middle of the game) and with monsters (and killing them),gates, clues, missions and so more. it's a rich game that is really enjoyable as a solo game or with friends.

RATING: 8
PROS:
Lovecraftian adventure theme comes through in game.  Globetrotting that plays quick.  Setup is not too bad.  Every character is useful, giving the game high replay value.

CONS:
Cursed status is too powerful.  Some rumors can end the game very fast, but that's just the nature of the draw/beast. Not all characters are created equally.

NOTES:
I have both expansions.

RATING: 2
Just as bad as Arkham Horror. Not even an original game. I don't feel like I'm "doing" anything in this game. I feel like this game is playing me, and I'm reading the result.

There is no strategy to it. There are no meaningful decisions.

The theme is cool, but show me a freaking HP Lovecraft game that has some meaningful decisions and some player interaction in it, PLEASE.

RATING: 8
Mechanically derivative. Probably too fiddly for its own good. A poorly written Fantasy Flight rulebook. Regardless it creates damn good stories and is never dull. Punches above its weight.

Played with five: whilst I still dig it with lower player counts, five was too slow and unwieldy and pushed the playtime far too long. Keep it at four or less.

RATING: 9
Made about ten games right now and I find the game really funny with friends. The encounter cards add a huge narrative element and you'll never know how it will end...A lot of ancient ones to defeat (we won our first game on our 8th game).

Maybe after some games the cards are a little bit repetitive but the small expansions help a lot!

RATING: 10
Surprisingly easy to learn.

The story comes across mostly by cards (encounter phase). Usually you read some flavour text on the card and then resolve some test (roll dice), sometimes followed by another diferent test, either resulting in sucess or fail. But if you don't like the reading you can simply look at what icon it shows and roll test for that particular icon. If you don't like rolling dice then this game is not for you, because you will be rolling dice a lot.

On your turn, you can move, collect train or boat tickets (to use while moving), rest, trade, buy assets, and do actions printed on cards and character sheet. Then everyone has some kind of encounter (monster, location, gate, clue, expedition, rumor, mystery cards) and then one mythos card is drawned and resolved.

Really the drive here is the story. You have a lot of generic story but also, when resolving clues, you have story that is related to the Ancient One you are facing, in that particular game.

The main objective of the game is solving 3 diferent misteries regarding the Ancient One (The game provides 4 Ancient Ones to choose from). As gates keep opening up between worlds, and with them lots of monsters keep coming, you have to find a balance between closing down gates and still persuing the Ancient One misteries.

Lots of diferent Characters to choose from, with diferent stats, and lots of spells and diferent kind of weapons. A bit too much for non-gamers.

Found ourselves stuck on a stage, unable to descipher the manuscript in our hands. Failed at acting and increased doom by 1.

I can see how this can appeal to someone not having experiencenced Arkham horror. Less decks to  remember, less table space(slightly a TV least) more streamlined parts of the AH version.  For me it fell slightly flat, the mysteries didn't keep it tight enough, not that many dice when rolling for checks, even more downtime (didn't expect that).. I would play AH instead..

I've played this 4 times so far, but every time there's been at least 1 newbie, so take this with a grain of salt.

There's a lot of rules to keep track of. But, the game flows easily enough as long as at least one or two people playing know what to do. It'll just require that person to "run" the game for a while before everyone gets caught up to speed. 

In every game, the newbs learned what to do after a few rounds, so it required less micromanaging by myself/other "experienced" players.

I've played Azathoth twice (once with 2 people, once with 3), Yog Sothoth once (3 people), and Hastur from one of the expansion packs (5 engineering students that thought "how hard could it be?" and were promptly destroyed). Each one seemed balanced. Even when we got mauled by Hastur, it felt like the result of bad strategy/unlucky dice rolls instead of an overpowered enemy.

This is a great game, very fun and I love the way it can change drastically from play to play, even when you are up against the same boss monster.

Replaced AH for me.  It cleaned up all the stuff that drags down AH and makes it last forever.  Rules are 100% clearer and make more logical sense.  Game can be played in 60-90 minutes easily now instead of AH games lasting 15 minutes or 6 hours depending on your luck.

Many have said and I would agree that this is more adventure than the doom and gloom of Arkham Horror.  I like both games, but this definitely has potential to hit the table more often for its more streamlined and easier going play.  A lot less fiddliness than Arkham.  Arkham is still a great game though and I don't see myself getting rid of it as it still has a sweet spot for me.  A lot of expense made as well once you have some of the expansions. Eldritch Horror I enjoy playing solo more as well.  Own both games.  Yeah that is the answer.

RATING: 9
Quests that put you in the universe, a scaling difficulty that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and a very different skillset that you can provide to each character while still staying balanced.

RATING: 6
Great story aspect, great theme and atmosphere and fantastic immersion. But all in all Arkham Horror is better in that regard. Eldritch is a better board game in some regard but you will miss here the experience Arkham can deliver in its best moments 

But the basic game is playable 8 times. Then you have read almost every card in that game and the great story aspect slips away.

FFG has to develop more card expansions fast!

EDIT: It is all about the group. With the right group this can be a 10. With groups that want a more gamey experience this can feel very flat.

EDIT 2: This game starts becoming really boring. It does not stand the test of time for me. The luck driven encounter drawings where you you will not get a clue token even after a successful test is really annoying.

Arkham surpasses this. By far.

Just a little bit less chaos than Arkham plus the strategic level rather than tactical level of play (keeping intact and solving the mysteries as opposed to keeping intact and 1st person battling monsters and closing gates) makes this a slightly better experience.
Only downside is that a point can arise where you know you will lose the game but there is at least half an hour of play to go, just call it then.

While Elder Sign sucked me in, I wanted to have more ...

So I decided to take the plunge and buy Eldritch Horror. And then it dawned on me ... this is the kind of game I love (and have been searching for all my life)...

Lots of flavor text, lots of Lore.

"Pure" gamers who want to win in Eurogames will probably find it not competitive enough or too long or too random. But I don't play games "to win". Theme these days is the number one in great games. If you look at mechanics only, keep playing the aging Eurogames. 

But ...

I play games to have adventures and experience the fun and story telling of a correct setting.

Eldritch Horror offers this in spades. 

Good advice: take your time to watch the many Youtube videos how to learn to play and then take the dive.

I think it has only a 4/10 complexity if you take your time to learn the flow of the game.

Top materiel for SOLO play with 2 Investigators.

Best rulebook of Fantasy Flight Games in recent years.

EDIT: Notched it up to 9.8 after an epic loss. Seriously, this is no longer a game but an extensive walk in a story of HP Lovecraft.

EDIT 2: 9.9. While Mansions of Madness is equally good, the solo experience puts this 0.1 point ahead as my number one game second only behind Labyrinth war on Terror, while MoM is really out of category.

What an experience.

Much like Arkham, this one needs a group that is into the source material.  We absolutely had one of those!  6 of us hit this up at the last meet and came out the other side winners after a little over 2 hours. 

Really enjoyed the narrative, and the mechanics weren't horrible (though I'm sure we made a fair few mistakes!).  Definitely want to get this to the table again, as I reckon it could play in under 2 hours quite easily once a group has their head around it.

Not a complete Arkham replacement (not yet anyway!) but maybe after an inevitable expansion or two.....

A streamlined reworking of Arkham Horror, but not a replacement for it. Thematically it's more globe-trotting adventuring than pure horror, and also not as tense. Mechanically it's cleaner, but still a lot for newcomers to take in. It's shorter, but play time still balloons with 4+ players. I like it and I think the Indiana Jones flavor can be ramped up with expansions, but I'd still take the flavor of Arkham over this in most instances. 

Edit: I'm happy to say this game is becoming more flavorful with more expansions added in, especially the larger ones.

The more I play this game more I'm convinced it's really not much less fiddly than Arkham, and those mechanics not as immersive as the fiddly stuff in Arkham. However, unlike Arkham this game feels stronger with more expansions added in.

Eldritch Horror is a more simplified and linear version of Arkham Horror. It is a game with heavy theme and role play that very enjoyable to play. However, compared to Arkham Horror, the simplicity makes Eldritch Horror less interesting to players who want more freedom in their choices and variety throughout their gameplays. Eldritch Horror is a fine game but it might not satisfy the thirst of certain types of boardgame enthusiasts.

It was much bigger than expected. Quite heavy game with a lot of different scenarios and a great theme!
I am not a Cthulu fan and wouldn't want to own many games around that theme but I like how it plays in Eldritch horror.
There is a bit too much of dice rolling and luck involved to me but it is still enjoyable since we are all playing together so even if your character is always failing, you can still enjoy your time.
The downplay is a bit too much though. It might depend on the people you play with but in our group, when playing with 5 it was often too much thinking and talking (and we still lost...). I wouldn't want to play it with more that that and less would be preferable.

The main strength of the game is that it does carry a decent story and is highly thematic. For me its just not quite fun enough to justify the play time.

RATING: 7.5
it is a long game. it is complicated. it is kind of immersive i guess, if you're into that sort of thing. lovecraft was a racist but if you can get over that, its an enjoyable mythos. although the whole 'incomprehensible horror' idea is kind of thrown out the window when you can shoot them in the face. 
i guess what im trying to say is, its a fun game, but don't expect any real lovecraftian feel. is it worth it? probably. defnitely too complex and long for small children

Having a lot of fun with this one...2 2-player games and 2 3-player games. Won once, lost twice, and a draw (we won, but then found out that during the special encounter with the GOO, my daughter was counting 5's as a success. She had a cursed condition).

All 4 games took between 2 and 2.5 hours.

Great dive into the Lovecraftian Universe. For anyone who enjoys his writings, or if you have never read any, it is a wonderful, thematic experience. Each ancient one provides a different, story and experience throughout the game. It doesn't rank higher on my ratings because it isn't a game that I would choose to play as often as others. Even though I do quite enjoy it, I typically lean towards Eurogames over Ameritrash.

You HAVE to be in the right mood.  This is pure American-themed gameplay: awesome artwork, lots of fiddly bits, lots of combat (sort of), and LOTS of dice rolling.  While there is certainly strategy involved, the game still takes you on a ride.  It does things TO you rather than you controlling IT.  And the odds are pretty good that the game will really smack you around.

So get into character, invest in the story, and enjoy the ride.  If you do, you'll likely have a good time.  If you don't, it'll be a dice rolling exercise in futility.  And at 45 minutes per player (30 is really pushing it if you engage with the story and read the narrative bits), that can feel very, very long.

UPDATE: Eventually, I soured on the experience and sold the game.  I'm a strategy gamer at heart and also not big on co-ops (Pandemic Legacy being the exception).  This was a swing and a miss but I'm glad I tried it.

Pro's:

1) The art and the story the game tells, the mood and the setting itself.
2) Variety of cards and locations and ridiculous events that can happen. Example, taking a debt to purchase a shotgun only to use the same shotgun on the guys that come to collect the debt.
3) The build up of the tension as the world starts to completely fall apart and you are in a desperate battle against the minions of the elder gods or the elder gods themselves.

Con's: 

1) The length of the game coupled with the reliance on dice rolls can sometimes feel really mean. Even if you work your hardest to mitigate, it can be really frustrating to then lose.
2) The game needs an expansion to get the needed variety, furthermore there are a lot of pieces and cards and bits that can sometimes make the game feel super fiddly.
3) Totally minor issue, but why on earth did they not ship the game with more dice.
4) I feel like a lot of the game is basically just mathing out which characters should be played at what player count. For example always picking Charlie Kane at 4 players. Why is the best way to win to basically play it incorrectly.

Addendum: This game has gotten worse and worse with subsequent plays. It's hard to say exactly what it is, but ultimately It never feels like I'm actually experiencing a world of eldritch horror where my sanity slowly erodes. The way the player actually interact mechanically and what the game is spelling out for me in terms of theme never really gels well for me. It feeds the theme to you, but the problem is this works one way only. Normally when a game feels thematic it acts as positive feedback loop. This on the other hand doesn't, basically it is a puzzle. I am hoping that Arkham Horror the card game does what this game could not.

RATING: 9
I previously rated this game real low...But turns out, my game group had somehow made a ton of mistakes in learning the rules to this game, leading to a very lax might-as-well-do-everything-because-why-not type game that never seemed to end.

Oh god was that so wrong.

Sure it can start deceptively obvious with what you should do, but then the board starts getting real crowded with all these portals, monsters, clues, and rumors all over the world while the ol' doom clock keeps ticking faster and faster. This easily gives me the senses of impending doom and urgency that I crave to have in my cooperative games. 

And yet it still giving you the ability to find crazy artifacts that allows you to slay everything in your path! But at the same time you could still lose it all in the toss of a die roll...Which can be avoided by resting so you're more likely to survive the next encounter! But do you really want to take turns to rest when more and more terrible things keep popping up all around the world, that you probably should be addressing!? It's these hard decisions that I love so much! 

Granted, I'll never ever ever play this with those who are prone to over analyzing every possible move for every other person at the table ever again...But, why in the world would you want to play any co-ops with those types anyway? 

Now that I own this, I will probably waste no time in grabbing up the many expansions. I'm excited. But oh, will my wallet weep.

Quite boring RNG fiesta. There are so many mechanics to keep track of that the atmosphere gets lost. A bit too heavy but there is just so much shallow "roll the high number or bust" dice chucking. Also, it lacks interesting player cooperation mechanics.

It's SORTA Arkham Horror 2.0.  Yeah it feels like a streamlined version of that game.  But I actually think it's more Tales of Arabian Nights, Tentacle Co-Op Edition.  The game isn't about the teamwork or tension.  It's really just about the stories and adventures you face while uncovering some sinister, otherworldly, Lovecraftian shit.  I very much enjoy it.

I never play Arkham horror.  But Eldritch horror is a EPIC game were you are few investigaters trying to protect the world from the ancien gods (in vain for most of my played XD).  
Pros:  Good immersion in the Lovecraft world.  I really feel like each of the ancien gods are a big threat against the world.  A must for Lovecraft fans. The game is hard... but i mean really hard (i only win once on 7 plays), but you will have fun trying to beat the game!  When I won the game (against the easiest ancien Azatoth) I was so happy, it was rewarding (and it was a close win).  The encounter are fun and it had some history for your investigators.  The co-op in the game is great, we need to help each other to get the full potential of your team, and you sure need it. 
Cons: it is a long game (4 hour minimum, and the more player you play, the more long it will be), and that why i don't play as i would like. It says 1-8 players on the box... i will never play this game more than 4 players, never...  There is little rules hard to remember, but the reference book is really helpfull.  

I promise my friend to pay them their drink next time, if we win, it get more intense and fun ;P.  One of my favorite game, im going to get at least one small expension for this one for more of the good stuff.

We enjoy this as a co-op game every once in a while. All of the components give the game an epic feel, and there is lots of variability with different ancient ones and investigators. We also have all 3 small box expansions to increase card variety. The set up time is pretty significant and my wife enjoys the game and we always laugh about something while we play. I often find that it runs a bit long for what I want and of course there is lots of randomness. I don't love the game personally, but my wife is a fan and I fin it interesting enough for some sporadic plays.

Another game with great theme that tells a great story. It fits into a category that I call story telling games. It's not high strategy there is no sure fire way to win or route to take.

5p game of this took us learn 3.5 hours. Was a learning game with some rules lookups but took pretty long. Ended up not being so fun for some of my friends during turns in which they drew cards and either couldnt get the reward or bad things caused them to nearly miss a turn.

Not a fan. Hoping you roll 5s and 6s for 3+ hours wasn't fun. Maybe if I was more into the lore, or more of a fan of Ameritrash, this would appeal to me more, but I wasn't feeling it. I didn't hate it, but I'll probably pass next time.

It suffers from obvious decisions like most co-op games, so while you have many options for actions, which ones you should actually do to try to win are almost always quite obvious.

Even though Elder SIgn is one of my favorites, I was hesitant to buy this or Arkham Horror.  B&N had these on sale and I couldn't resist.  I'm so glad that I bought it, because it is fantastic!  I've already ordered the first expansion that's only recently come back into print.  It's got all the flavor of Lovecraft and provides a more epic experience than Elder Sign.  Elder Sign is still the go to for some simple and quick dice fun, but Eldritch will be our new "big" Lovecraftian game.

Still enjoying this great game a year on.

And another year on still really like it.

I continue to like it more and more and as result it is seriously blinged up. I'm now eyeing up my first big expansion, it's that good.

RATING: 9
I held off on this game. As Undead Viking has said, it felt disloyal to Arkham to embrace it. I played once (had to, of course) and I didn't like it. I had to reshuffle the Mystery cards back into the deck and the operation felt like Chutes and Ladders. Was it streamlined, yes, clearly...but that initially made me like it LESS. I liked the swagger of being able to handle the setup, fiddly rules and simple game management of Arkham. That feels like a side game, like part of the ritual.

I kept thinking about EH, though, how I could have prepared myself better for those Mystery draws. I thought about different strategies. I played again and liked it a good deal more. I knew what I was doing, even if I were losing. It felt more like a story. I also saw how the Reckoning and Spell mechanics not only were much more elegant mechanics that what Arkham offers, but they also supported the narrative more. The different GOO's providing different encounters is a huge improvement. I still haven't won, but I am intrigued by this game. I may have to admit that it is replacing Arkham for me. It still doesn't feel quite like it has the richness of Arkham, but the game at this point only has one expansion. I am looking forward to the ride.

Update: I've had a flurry of playing EH and, pound for pound, it's now better than Arkham for me. I've won sessions, I've lost sessions; all the sessions have been really fun and thematic. It's a solid 9 - and I feel perhaps only one or two expansion mechanics away (for added richness) from being a 10.

Monster of a game and to be honest not really into "cthulhu" anything but I'm in it for the on going stories and adventure of it all.

Although I do love this, I feel that the talk of the story elements in this game are a little overblown.  Other than a few extra cards, the story component is only marginally more vital than it is in Arkham Horror.  I like most of the rule changes and the way gates work are more interesting and thematically make more sense.  For now (before more expansions appear) it's obviously less finnicky than Arkham, although I wouldn't say it completely eclipses Arkham Horror for me.  I'll gladly play either.

This game really brings the Lovecraftian theme to life. There is a lot of luck involved with all the dice rolls, but it works with the horror theme to add tension and suspense. I especially like that the game difficulty can be altered by changing the mythos cards or using a different BBEG. What impressed me the most was that they took the time to write descriptions for every event, and tie in items and monsters to the theme mechanically rather than just leaving them as abstract dice rolls.

Take a great RPG-esque adventure game (Arkham Horror) but streamline some mechanics and sterilize the whole thing and you've got Eldritch Horror.

When they streamlined/sterilized AH, they got rid of everything that made Arkham Horror great.
This is no longer an adventure game, it's a puzzle game along the lines of Pandemic. Unfortunately, unlike Pandemic, it's still got a ton of fiddly bits and many decks of cards just like it's forefather Arkham Horror.

So, if you're looking for an adventure game that will leave you with cool stories to tell afterwards, look elsewhere.
If you're looking for a game like Pandemic but longer and with a load of bits and cards, you've found your game.

RATING: 10
Comparable to Arkham Horror but different enough to warrant keeping both if you're a fan of the genre and the games themselves.  So to compare the two games, this is more streamlined than Arkham and has a little more of narrative while Arkham is a little more immersive and detailed.  I like how each GOO has their own mysteries to solve, their own end game condition, etc.  All of the cards and encounters, which are the heart of the game, are very cool.  If I'm being honest, yeah, it's better than Arkham.

I love this game. It's thematic, tense, and plays pretty smoothly. It can seem quite random at times (and in some sense it certainly is) but as you get experienced you'll find there are many things you can do to tip the odds in your favor. It helps that I really like cooperative games generally. I would much rather work with my friends than try to crush them (or, more likely, be crushed by them.)

The replayability is excellent with a 12 different investigators and 4 different Ancient Ones in the box. The number of possible combinations is huge. Furthermore, because of the luck of the draw, even games with the same investigators against the same opponent will play out vastly differently.

The investigators are not quite balanced (Charlie Kane and Jacqueline Fine are head and shoulders above the rest), but this is not really an issue in a co-op game. They are all nicely thematic and most have interesting abilities. Two favorites of mine are Lily Chen, the martial artist who can train her skills faster than other investigators, and Diana Stanley, the ex-cultist with powerful magic but a fragile psyche.

The Ancient Ones present four different themes. Cthulhu (the hardest) deals in sanity damage and sea encounters. Shub-Niggurath floods the board with monsters. Yog-Sothoth (the easiest) interacts with spells. Finally, Azathoth's shtick is that he (it?) will immediately devour the world if Doom is allowed to run out. They all provide significantly different games.

The game is also highly flexible with regard to player count. It plays quite well at anything from 1 to 6 players. (It can even support 7 or 8, but I think the game starts to bog down at that point.) The optimal number of players is probably 3 or 4.

A nice aspect of the game is that the difficulty can be easily adjusted in a number of ways. The win rate for four players using the default rules against an average Ancient One is roughly 60% (though player skill will make a significant difference here); with some simple adjustments, you can probably get your expected win rate anywhere from 20% to 90%. So whether you prefer wins to be rare events or the usual outcome, Eldritch Horror can accommodate that. Personally, I find the default settings a little too generous to the players. I recommend removing the easy Mythos cards and perhaps spawning an extra Gate at setup.

One issue with the base game is a relative lack of cards. Most encounter decks only have 8 cards in them, which is not enough. You'll become overly familiar with the encounters quite quickly. I therefore recommend picking up the Forsaken Lore expansion, which will solve this issue.

The biggest downsides of this game are probably the setup and storage issues. Setup is typically a ~20 minute process. The game box does not provide any decent way of storing the game's innumerable cards and tokens, so you'll have to come up with something yourself.

RATING: 3
Blech. I'll start with some small positives. There is a good theme and some sense of progression with leveling up your characters and obtaining items. 

However, significant downtime although we only played with 4 players, and not much strategy. On top of this, 2 of the 4 of us had absolutely terrible dice rolls all game, and no matter what you plan, if you can't roll you're done. I was 'detained' and skipping my turn easily a third of the game, and traveled about one square. All this and it took 2.5 hours. Not fun and although the dice rolls made it worse, I don't know that the enjoyment would have gone up significantly even if the dice were falling in my favor. This, Talisman, and others in the same family are simply not my kind of game. 

All of that said, although I don't absolutely love Arkham Horror, for some reason it sticks out as being measurably more enjoyable than Eldritch in my mind. This is one of my worst game experiences in recent memory, especially for a game as well regarded as this one is.

2017  Arkham Horror on a global scale, with revamped art, cleaner and more intuitive rules, and Mythos cards that punch you in the face.

Tighter, streamlined version of Arkham Horror. Similar mythos and feeling, but different gameplay. It feels stripped down and less immersive--more mechanical.

This is so much better than Arkham Horror, it just plays so much faster and smoother. And because the rules don't get in the way so much it feels much more like an actual story unfolds (even when it's just a sequence of random and sometimes a little silly encounters). I like that the basic rules are really simple: most of the game comes from the cards not from the rulebook, with new players you can basically start right away and they'll know the basics after watching another players turn. I also love the conditions and spells with random effects. The pacing of the game is fine, but  with many players it can still take quite long.

Fanastic and richly themed game. Hours to setup and play, but worth every second. Replayability and variability of each game's narrative has also been improved since Arkham Horror. 

---------------

Having picked up a few expansions my rating of the game has actually decreased. Whilst it's fun to have new characters, it does sometimes make th game feel confused and overwraught. I also have come to the realisation that the game is just a little too long for what it is. I'm usually ready to finish 20-30 minutes before you actually do, especially as it's usually very clear what the outcome of the game will be by that point. However, despite the number of logged plays, I have certainly played this game over 50 times, so to bash on it too hard would be unfair - I've maybe just made myself a little tired of it for a while. However, I do refuse to play with more than three players now as the game does drag with 4+, despite this being one of my other half's top five games.

I am a big fan of the mythos and after a few DVDs and books I truly needed a game of it. Friends already have Elder Sign, Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness so these were off the list. The rest of the Cthulhu-themed games were quite "nah" so I decided to go for "little Arkham Horror"...
Oh my great old one was I wrong. Yeah it is like a little brother of Arkham Horror but it is such a good game that I feel a bit offended by my earlier thoughts.

It feels like it is easier to keep it going, less moving part than AH but the same feeling. I also like the point that this is a little further away from the characters itself and the story is more about the old ones themselves (That was mentioned in a review and I think the reviewer is right in that point). I especially like the fact that every great old one has it's own deck of cards which brings up different stories.
Unfortunately it has fewer cards and fewer deities wich results in a lesser diversity.
But, hey it's FFG, there will be an expansion for EH.

Overall: Great game!

This game rocks! BIG time! Relatively easy to learn and just sucks you in to the thick Cthulhu feeling!

I don't rate it a 10 because I fear a bit for the replayability. There aren't THAT many location encounter cards, which I fear will bring a "samey" feeling to the game when you have played 5-6 times. But time will tell.

I have yet played 3 times with only the core set, and I definitely are going to play again - SOON!

UPDATE 2016-10-07
WOW! With the addition of "Forsaken Lore" it adds a BUNCH of extra encounter cards (among other more stuff), I change Eldritch Horror to a 10. This game is AMAZING! I haven't yet experienced the same encounter twice. BUY BUY BUY!

EH is a nice simplification of AH, but it is more fragile / "swingy".  A few bad rolls in AH has a minor impact that can usually be overcome (but not always).  Not so with EH - a small run of bad luck in EH often accelerates into a hopeless loss with little you can do to stop it.

Still, EH is a great game.

No serious game collection is complete without this. Love it. Game gets harder, not easier each time I play it as I try out different strategies and players.

Long time to setup and wish they included token trays and card holders. My only real issue as it can take an hour to setup (clear up table, find space to arrange cards, sit down, arrange cards again, sit down,... repeat).

Will be adding expansions.

Lot of controversy about this game vs Arkham Horror.  I have owned and played both and this is my short and sweet comparison.  Keep in mind this takes into account my specific gaming group.

Arkham Horror vs Eldrich Horror
1.  Eldrich duration is better due to its quicker overall playing time.
2.  Eldrich plays quicker per player as the turns are broken up in a way that leaves players active for shorter periods but more frequent.
3.  Eldrich less prone to affect my AP players.
4.  Arkham has tons more variety.
5.  Eldrich builds a more cohesive story
6.  Arkham has lots of cool pieces.
7.  Eldrich setup is easier.
8.  Arkham has a more creepy dark alley overtone which does a better job of elevated the horror aspect.  Eldrich seems more adventurish.

So, basically, when we play, we prefer Eldrich.  If we played it more frequently, we would probably prefer Arkham due to the more variation.  Arkham typically made it to the table once a year.  Eldrich will likely average three to four.  

2017 Update:  Lots of expansions have given Eldritch the variation it needed.  Still going strong.

RATING: 7
Reminiscent of Pandemic due to the world map, fixed travel routes, co-op elements and random outbreaks of new infections - though in this case they are the Lovecraftian monstrosities of the title.  It works well enough and all the players are actively engaged and builds to an interesting climax - but the game engine driving encounters etc is a bit byzantine, which I think is the main reason it takes rather too long for what it is. More experience may reduce the time and remove that feeling, which would be good as it delivers otherwise.

After only two plays it was decided that it was time for Arkham to go. Eldritch does what Arkham did, only better and faster. Very much looking forward to Fantasy Flight releasing expansions for this.

The board cards and components are gorgeous. The gameplay fits right in with as a pandemic style battle against a spreading threat. I found the game quickly devolved into quarterbacking without anyone really feeling like they were leading their own adventure. If you like pandemic and Lovecraftian Lore this game is a great pick up for you. If you're on the fence with pandemic I don't feel like this offers enough of a change to be worth it.

This is definitely cleaner than Arkham Horror, but maybe not clean enough yet for my taste.

The flavor is still good, but doesn't work as well for me here as it did in Arkham. I think I just prefer the art direction and more intimate setting of Arkham. Globetrotting feels pretty weird for Lovecraft.

As a narrative experience, this is much like Arkham. There are some neat things that can happen through play (particularly with the new Condition/Spell cards and their secrets on the back) but reading all the flavor text from the various mythos cards, etc., tells an incoherent story at best.

The Conditions deck is probably my favorite part of the game. It's a massive simplification of the separate injury/madness/blessing/curse decks from Arkham, and the fact that you don't know quite what you're getting into with each one you take leads to a lot of excitement.

I also really like that each Old One now has set objectives and mystery cards rather than just having to close X gates. The mystery cards improve the storytelling.

All in all, if I'm in the right mood this is pretty engaging. I guess I just don't see the need for a game this random to take this long.

Going into the game, I knew that I probably wouldn’t like it. I was right, and here is why: Normally I like coops, and as this game is in the top100 I would love to try it. However, I also knew that it was a more ameritrash-y than euro-y coop, and I’m a eurogamer. Also, we were 7 players (!) and most if not everybody was new to the game. Even though the rules weren’t too convoluted, the game dragged on and it was hard to know what everybody could do and which items they had. This would have been remedied by playing with fewer players, and I would like to try that just to do the game justice and give it a fair shot. However, even with fewer players who know the game, I’m pretty sure that I am never going to like it – it’s too long and random! I’m not a theme guy either, so the Cthulhu theme doesn’t save the somewhat boring gameplay. 

But the worst thing about Eldritch Horror by far is the too simple/boring gameplay and the randomness due to the die rolls. Come on, you do a simple thing on your turn and then sometimes roll some dice in order to make progress towards the goal of the game. But it’s so random what you roll, and you often don’t know which of a couple of abilities you need to be good at which increases the randomness even more. Yuck. Give me Ghost Stories (yes, it’s random too, but much less so!), Pandemic or almost every other coop. They are much more fun to play (but again, I did play it once with 7, and it should be a little better with 4 or so).

To me this is a slightly less gruelling, somewhat less complicated version of Arkham Horror.  For a LLLOOONNNGGG game such as this to have so much luck in it turns me off.

A cooperative storytelling game that while it plays quicker than Arkham Horror is still overly long and full of nothing but dice rolls to resolve actions and getting cards that benefit you and potentially improve your chance of success. In the first few rounds there was only 1 of us being successful and you can tell right away it really set us back in meeting our goals as the event deck was just ticking away. This is why I've been moving away from coop games lately as I just feel between the game and the luck we were having made it absolutely impossible for us to win no matter what we did . I also can't stand a game that has "skip a turn" as a penalty, we can be more creative these days. However, I think these sort of things is what to expect from a game that relies more on its thematic elements as opposed to strategic elements and for me the Lovecraft theme is not one I enjoy so it's hard to muster any excitement for this.

Incredibly beautiful artwork tacked onto a random nonsense generator.  None of the players in my group felt any accomplishment on beating back monsters, nor upon closing gates, nor upon solving our first mystery.  We felt no urgency, neither did we feel despair.

The game seems to break down into 'move, heal/loot/prepare, then random bad thing happens and I roll an arbitrary number of dice to see if I lose sanity or not.'  After around two hours, and nine Mythos cards, in which the Doom counter barely moved, we started talking about our impressions of Eldritch Horror thus far.

We decided to just go play Love Letter and Small World instead.

Seemed to be a shorter, easier version of Arkham Horror. Pleasant but I'm not sure that this kind of game isn't better with a horrific sense of impending doom.

update Aug 2015

The last year hasn't been kind to Eldritch.  As my comments below indicate, we didn't hate the game but we didn't love it either.  But let's face it, "mediocre" doesn't earn a place in the rotation let alone one on the shelf and as time has past Eldritch finds itself relegated to the shelf.

While Eldritch gathers dust, Arkham Horror has been played at least twice.  Why?  

Arkham presents the Cthulhu mythos with more flavor, the gamers become immersed in the story as they play.  Arkham develops real tension as well, it pulls the gamers into the swirling madness.  More importantly, while remaining quite a luck fest, Arkham gives gamers more real choices.  It's simply a better _game_, something you play whereas Eldritch often feels more like something that plays while you watch.  

Eldritch fails to come off the shlef for several reasons.  First, its replayability is poor right out of the box.  We all know Fantasy Flight is going to make expansions, but Eldritch suffers from the _need_ to be expanded.  A need that's apparent the first game you play.  Thinking that we'd throw good money after bad just to make a base game replayable is a bit patronizing.  Hook us with a good game, and we'll buy more.  

Secondly, Eldritch isn't very good at what it does.  As a globe trekking coop, it falls flat when compared to other members of the field.  It simply doesn't offer enough real choices to players while pouring dice over them.  

As a Cthulhu'ian storytelling engine it pales when compared to every other Cthulhu themed game I can think of except that silly Yahtzee one.

As a three to four hour long game.  No, there's just no way we'd choose Eldritch over virtually any other game(s) to play for four hours.  And let's not sugar coat it, three to four hours is what we're talking about here.

Bottom line, Eldritch is a game we wanted to love, it sounds good in theory, but it just doesn't do anything well enough to justify table time and if it can't make it to the table, why have it in our collection?

-------------------------------------------------

6+ plays both solo and groups of 3 or 4.

I enjoy this game quite a bit.  It's true, the cards are thin, the board potato chips, and there are too few encounter cards, but it works well as a game.  

The problem with the encounter cards stems from basic arithmetic, half the sites on the map are cities so "it always seems" you're pulling encounter cards to read their city text.  In fact, the majority of the time you are on cities at turn end.  Given each board region has only eight encounter cards and the GOO's clue/research deck has twelve, we found encounters, particularly research encounters repeating even during our first play (I swear to all old ones if I see that damn "metallic crate with legs" one more time!).  

With time I found two aspects of the game that bother me more.  First, Blessings are rather hard to achieve in EH.  Gone is the Church and one's ability to chose to buy a blessing.  Now there's a spell that grants a blessing, but that's problematic and requires both an action be spent and that two investigators are in the same location.  Random encounters grant blessings as well, but we've found we miss the ability to "go get blessed".  Worse perhaps, the ability to remove a curse is more difficult as well.  Regardless, by making blessings rare, difficult and random, the designers have removed an important tactical tool; removed one of the last ways that players can control their fate.  And in Eldritch, you simply don't have the time to waste running around cursed. 

Which brings me to my biggest problem with the game.  Eldritch introduces a predetermined turn clock, the mythos deck's card count.  Investigators have X turns in which to accumulate and spend the clues, spells, and actions necessary to solve the GOO's three (or four) mysteries.  If the deck runs out ... the game ends.  No Big Bang, no GOO awakening, no thematic icing on the cake of the past three hour session.  The game simple ends.

In over half a dozen plays we have either won (rarely) or lost by mythos deck exhaustion.  Only one time did doom reach 0 and the GOO awaken, and even then a turn later the mythos deck ran out.  And there's something deeply dissatisfying about losing because the deck runs dry.  We immersed ourselves in a story for a few hours only to have the illusion shatter and the game be revealed in its mechanical barrenness.

Are we playing sub-optimally?  Of course, but we're playing the way we enjoy.  We're certainly good at closing gates, which drive the doom track.

The game's strength stems from its focus on solving GOO specific clue/research encounters and GOO mystery "tasks".  Gone are the clues you simply "pick up", here in Eldritch you might spend several turns in a location trying to earn the clue token located there.  This is thematically fantastic, but burns the limited encounter deck even quicker.  Imagine, it takes you three turns to earn a clue token, there went a quarter of the GOO's twelve research encounter cards for that location type.  Given half the clues will be in cities, and that the most profitable locations in which "to camp" while repeatedly trying to solve clues are cities ... you can see that during a game the research decks cycles three or more times, with most city encounters appearing twice.  Park an investigator (like Mr Kane) in London to generate clues, many of which appear where the investigators desire, often a city, and the effect gets even worse.

Those three turns also cost you almost a quarter of the mythos clock deck, and I'm not sure what you can do about it.

Listen, the math is simple: each investigator gets two actions a turn, and the mythos deck has 16 cards, that's 32 actions your investigator gets a game, assuming they're not detained.

Where the game succeeds is in delivering a reasonably cohesive narrative set in the Cthulhu mythos.  Something that Arkham can sometimes completely fail to do.  It's true, some encounters just seem random, but they seem random in the normal "shit happens" sort of way we all experience in life.  Given that the research encounters and GOO mysteries are tied to the GOO, a strong skeleton of a narrative exists if nothing else.

I'd also mention that one does identify with their investigators during play.  Investigators are quite quirky and yet seem balanced.  You find yourself loving the investigator who always passed critical tests with just a die or two.  Investigators can also improve their skill attributes, allowing players to customize their character to some degree.  True, it may be sub-optimal play to waste precious mythos cards (i.e. time) improving your character, but it makes the game more engaging.  Besides if you find yourself with a choice between moving over two turns to a trouble spot via a space that might grant you an improvement or moving through one that is likely not to ... you take the path of improvement.  As these locations are all cities in regions, once again you can see the burden on the city encounter portion of the eight card region decks. 

Investigators can also acquire Conditions, further quirks that often aren't very severe, but give you the choice to burn actions resting in the hopes of alleviating the condition, or risk its wrath if you roll badly during reckonings.

While I've found the use of a rulebook and separate reference guide works surprisingly well, invariably several critical rules or nuances are "buried" in the reference guide.  Here are a few critical examples to watch for in play.  

(1) Clues are discarded, pitched out of play until the draw cup runs empty, and not recycled to the draw cup so that in a given game clues will not appear twice in the same place unless the entire cup empties and is refilled.  To a degree this helps to keep the research encounter deck from wearing thin as quickly.

(2) Investigators can only use one bonus from an item or ally ... we skip the ally clause of this and limit investigators to a single item in combat but all the allies they can use (which usually isn't many).

(3) Combat is handled differently then in Arkham although the symbols and graphical presentation is virtually identical.  Re-read the combat section and the accompanying example.  We played a couple games (and enjoyed the game) playing combat in the incorrect Arkham style which basically results in less sanity loss and more stamina loss.  Bottom line, neither test is "all or nothing" as in Arkham.

(4) The game's difficulty can be scaled by removing particularly difficult cards (with tentacles) or 'easy' ones (blue ice).  There's no shame in this as the game is still difficult for newcomers playing in the "easy" configuration while the "normal" difficulty level can be positively nightmarish with bad card draws.

We choose to ignore cards that make you throw away completed mysteries.  That's simply a rubbish mechanic.  Nikki, how could you let Corey get that one by? 

As for comparisons to Arkham.  They both have a place in my heart.  I would stress that Eldritch isn't significantly shorter to play, and not much easier to teach, but it does have less rules "to remember" during play.  The machine has less parts to keep track of, and those parts it does have are easier to track through better card ergonomics and token use.  For example, monsters rarely if ever move, so right there, you've eliminated "types" of monsters, monster movement arrows, the sky, etc.  The few monsters that do move either move to a home location when they enter the board or they move during the Reckoning resolution (with both types clearly indicated by an icon on their face and text on their back).

Eldritch Horror is far from perfect.  In revisiting the Arkham approach to Cthulhu, Eldritch delivers a more cohesive narrative and requires less mental overhead to track details of the game engine.  This latter aspect may let some players (such as myself during solo play) focus more on the story and strategy of the game while becoming more immersed in the narrative and their investigator's fate.  But the narrative is still fueled by dice and some may find the game too chaotic or worse, repetitive.  Sadly, the limited encounter card pool and the artificial mythos clock work strongly against the narrative.  In fact, it's safe to say I found the game's narrative stronger during our first few plays.  New GOO refresh things a fair amount as the mysteries and research encounters change, but I worry that the game is becoming a mechanical exercise of skill tests

Bottom line, while I like a lot about Eldritch Horror, I suspect that it will not have the longevity that Arkham has showed even with the inevitable expansions.  That having been said, we have enjoyed the game for at least 6 plays, so you get a good bang for your buck.  I'd recommend fans of the mythos as well as folks who like challenging co-op games give Eldritch serious consideration.


As a variant, I think that the next time we play we'll add a fourth level of mythos cards of the same mix as present in the third level in hopes of lengthening the game clock to the point where the game ends for some thematic reason and not just because the rules say so.

It's hard to want to commit this much time to a high-luck excursion. Sometimes though, luck can swing in your favor, and nail-biting endings can happen, but they are rare. It's not really that bad though. Pulling off the long-odd situations feels good, and drawing just the right thing you need when you need it is enjoyable. But when this game smacks you down... you stay down.

An incredibly streamlined cousin of Arkham Horror.  With an outstanding ruleset, this is an excellent game in its own right.  But for me, doesn't replace Arkham Horror.  It's still a must have for any fan of the Mythos, but just doesn't have quite the same amount of tension in the dice rolling that its counterpart has.  And I personally prefer the more closed in feeling confines of Arkham, Dunwich and Kingsport than spanning the entire globe.  That's not to say the theme is lacking in EH because it definitely has it in spades, just a personal preference.   Great game, but doesn't replace Arkham.

I generally have very positive impressions of all the improvements made to the Arkham Horror base game.

The great thing about this game is the theme which does, I think, immerse you. The artwork is fantastic and the components look great.

I feel that if you are playing with just two players, the game has a more enjoyable feel if each person takes on 2 characters.

Many people stated that the game plays you, which is relatively true and in line with the theme of the game. To be honest this is true for most (if not all) co-op games because you are competing against the game itself! It is true that this game has limited strategy (so don't buy it if you want a purely strategic game) but there are good and bad choices to be made.

It is just such great story-telling.

A fun and really thrilling co-op experience that has so much to offer! This is everything I wanted from Arkham Horror, even though I'd call this a bit more streamlined and "casual". But that's also why Eldritch Horror comes out as the winner for me, since Arkham Horror was way too hard and all that extra gameplay and rules and game components only weighted it down rather than providing for an even more exiting and fun experience.

I find myself hesitating before I label a thematic FFG game as elegant but that is how I feel.  The conditions cards are wonderful way to handle a multitude of subsystems that made Arkham Horror increasingly fiddly. If FFG can stick to this format as much as possible with its expansions the rules overhead from added variety will be be trivial.

The reckoning events and associated iconography again seems a simple mechanical method of keepng track of triggered events.  The interaction between  the triggered events the old ones, monsters, conditions, and items add at lot of depth without complicated tracking.  Just look for the reckoning event icons and follow the instructions on the cards.

All of the encounter cards are resolved in a similar manner (even the "complex ecounters" are not that different).  Despite this streamlined process variety has not been lost.

The player still has to keep track of lots of item and character specific powers (actions and modifiers for instance) can get a bit overwhelming in a long game.  The rules around the old ones, tracking doom and the end game are somewhat less streamlined and lack the previously mentioned elegance.

I do not miss the character sliders, the maintenance phase, money, stackable dice modifiers, being trapped in a location and most importantly the reduced player agency that I associate with Arkham Horror. 

New material has integrated well, and plays well solo.

It was okay. I'm happy I've played it but I'm not sure when would I do it again.
It is too long for what it offers in exchange. I don't mind dice, I don't think the game is too random or the luck factor is not manageable. What I do think on the other hand it is I'm looking for more things in a ~2,5-3 hours long game. There was almost no strategy, no real cooperation you just do your stuff, roll the dice, be happy or swallow the bitter pill and move on. If it would be 60 mins or less I'd buy it.

I refuse to play it.

This may now be the king of ameritrash. FF have taken Arkham Horror and refined it into a monster of a very immersive gaming experience that maximises co-operative game play. Like Arkham, it remains a very long game and I would not recommend 5 or more players unless you have 4 or more hours to kill, but with 4 or less players the game will transport you and entertain in a way that many ameritrash games fall short.

Typical FFG product, typos on game pieces, rule book, they love to phone it in. Elder Sign was another class act, typos that changed game play, very poor rule book, 6 month wait for an FAQ, rule lawyers paradise. FGG is one publisher I usually avoid, they just don't improve, Mayfair Games the other one, I don't like their market manipulation, nor their convoluted reasoning to do so. My LGS are nothing more then comic or sport card shops, tokenly into board games, milking the collectible cards for all they are worth.

Rule of thumb stay away from FFG's first prints.

Eldritch Horror isn't a bad game, but as is more of a demo game. The problem is Forsaken Lore is needed to fill out the cards. Forsaken Lore should have been in EH, instead FFG's milks us again. Forsaken Lore is not an expansion.

They also seem to want to bloat EH like AH. That Mountain of Madness is the start, next Under the Pyramid, this side board crap is to be expected. The Focus mechanics found in MoM should have been in Eldritch Horror. It should be included in reprints of EH and added to EH's base game rules. Moot point, you can easily added it, you just have to know about it. The other thing that sucks is the tiny cards as is par for FFG, shrinking components. These card size borders on a deal breaker, I don't enjoy struggling with cards like this. They are a pain.

The two small box expansions are worth getting if picked up cheap, not worth the faux MSRP, jury still out on the 2 side board expansions.

Story driven adventure based on Lovecraft novels - theme which I don´t fancy but don´t mind as well. Narrative cards with pass-fail fork seems interesting, but I slightly feel the dice throws are too crucial here - compared to for example Stone Age or Castles of Burgundy.
Not the game for regular playing (cards tend to be repetitive), but sometimes it is OK to just fight against the Ancient one

RATING: 8.6
Although it is for up to 8 players I would never play with more than 4 and I enjoy it best with 2.  Otherwise it becomes a very long winded game.  

Cons:

- Eventually you run out of fresh cards and start to hear the same flavor text over and over, at which point it begins to feel like a grind. The expansions help remedy this.

- This game suffers a rounding error where it plays better with even numbers of characters than with odd numbers. 

- Winning is not an exciting event.  At some point you meet the conditions and then you are finished.  You feel more satisfaction and relief than triumph. 

Pros:

- characters being able to die and other characters being able to pick up their dropped items. I highly suggest not getting too attached to a character.  You can easily churn through two or three in one game.

- obtaining items from the reserve is straightforward

- a good selection of characters and backgrounds

Overall, it feels much like a simplified Arkham Horror, but with fewer scenarios to play out.  As more expansions are released, more scenarios become available.

Finally got a chance to play with my brother and his wife. She doesn't gravitate towards these kinds of games. There is too much stuff going on and they don't grab her attention. But she really loved this game. I must say that our play through was just awesome! It started off slow since we were all pretty much learning how to play at the same time. By the end of our game, we were discussing meaningful strategy. Had we had one more round, we would have won. We just couldn't get to the target location on time. We were all one space short. We were hoping to get lucky on the mythos draw. But no dice. 

Man it was intense! I can't say enough how fun and exciting this game was. Looking forward to another run...

Update: The more I play Eldritch Horror and become more aware of the tactical decisions in regards to mitigating your risks and the more I realize the value of certain strategies at certain times, the more I absolutely love this game. You mitigate risk. Yes, there are random elements. But you can greatly mitigate your risks. And the extra random elements fit nicely with the theme. This is a suspense/horror game after all. Having elements within the game that lie outside your control is fantastic and fits with the theme. Only an idiot would not get that. I've seen people rag on both Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror for that aspect. I've never played Arkham Horror, but it has always appealed to me. I've been tempted to buy it even after having Eldritch Horror. While having similar elements, they are vastly different games. I just haven't done so because of the large footprint, and having to buy more expansions and the large time commitment. Eldritch Horror has some of these things, too. But I'm not about to multiply that times two. 

As to that random element, it creates incredible suspense. That's the kind of game it is. But you can do something about it if you know how to play smart. You can lessen the risk, but it's still there. And that makes the game incredibly exciting and intense! And that leads to a whole lot of fun! To hell what other people think, I love this game! What an awesome treat this game is!

P.S. I own all of the expansions, Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under The Pyramids,  Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, and Cities in Ruin. I would say that if you want variety that will never get old, buy as many expansions as you can as soon as you can. Don't wait til you're seeing the same cards over and over. Having more different types of cards permanently extends the life of all of your cards. The more cards you have, the more plays you get without seeing the same card. So all cards will never get old.

The greatest thing about this game though is that because the story immersion is good, but not RPG like, you can run across the same card again, and it won't seem like the story has already been spoiled. There's so many choices to make that lie outside the narration on the cards. You have to solve mysteries, fight monsters, and close gates. You'll need to acquire assets, artifacts, and spells to help you do that. The order and way you do that will be based on what the board has set before you and how you choose to mitigate whatever risks you face. And that is the core of the game, which makes it an awfully slick and solid game. The story  narration adds icing on the cake and gives this game flavor as it gives context to all the play mechanics of the game.

The game play mechanics of the game are tight and balanced and are all based on risk management. And that is really what a mystery/adventure horror should be.

I liked the solid theme and aesthetics, but the actual gameplay beyond all that makeup felt extremely weak and random. There's almost no decision making involved at any point, and just reading cards and watching how many 5s and 6s you can roll until eventually winning or (probably) losing isn't enough to keep me interested. On top of that, the game is excruciatingly long for what it offers in exchange. Definitely not my cup of tea, nor the impressive game I was expecting.

Not bad as far as coops go.  A buy show on pacing. I feel a smaller map would be beneficial, you could shorten the mythos deck simultaneously to make the game play a bit faster with the same feel, instead of falling into a pattern of saminess and taking 4 turns to accomplish anything.

A very simple game, acceptable resolution system, could use a bit more variety.  This game also further enforces the fact I look right through theme/do not mentally engage it.

Oddly, it reminds me of Pandemic with dice. It's far more thematic, of course. I love it, but it needs more cards (easily rectified by incorporating an expansion or two), and it can play a little long. I've had a game take 5 hours!

I bought Arkham Horror years ago, and was really turned off by the amount of chrome and cruft in the rules.  When EH came around, I knew I had to investigate (hah-ha).  All the great flavor and experience that everyone always raves about in AH, in a clean, streamlined ruleset that I can even teach to novice gamers?  Sold.  One of the few games I own where I *still* haven't gone through the decks and looked at all the cards, so as to avoid spoilers for future plays.

I borrowed this game and played it quite a bit over the span of 2 weeks.

I wanted to like it, but it was so difficult (even playing with the easier cards) that it became more infuriating than fun. I want to enjoy the time I play games, not walk away discouraged.

The mechanics and game play are great and I would score it higher if I felt like I could win just one game.

I'll agree with BGG's placement for this game in their thematic list because truly this game oozes theme.  It really is the main appeal of the game when you're gazing at the impeccable artwork for all the Old One's cards and devouring the well-written lore spilled on every encounter card.
That being said I will disagree with BGG's placement for this game in their overall list because other than the theme I felt the gameplay was a bit dry and I was surprised at just how much of a dice game this turned out to be.
If you're a sucker for Lovecraftian  mythos or just love a game with thick horror/sci-fi theme then I recommend this game for being very immersive.  However, if you're not a big fan of either then you can safely pass on this as it's very heavy on theme but light on actual game.  
Not to mention holy christ is this game a pain to set up and take down.  That alone makes me rethink pulling this off my shelf considering how light the game feels.

RATING: 6
Much better experience than other cooperative games based on Lovecraft myths (you know). With this, each gear interacts with others giving a lively scenario. Cards text is full of little decisions, so you are engaged on story. Better, faster, simpler and evocative of Lovecraft's Circle pantheon of horrors. I like it.

Update: All the details, although less (and better) than Arkham, are very cumbersome. I can play esporadically when in right mood, so definitive rating seems... 6.5

Update: More plays and it seems very Arkham-like when you combat Shub-Niggurath. From now I prefer reading Lovecraft stories than playing FFG Mythos games. What a pity...

I think I'm just not a connoisseur of true cooperative games... it just feels like fighting a system instead of a lively opponent.

The cards, the CARDS! OMFG sorting out each deck and managing them was a fulltime job that falls to me whenever we play. OK... so this one won't hit the table that much I know.

Only play this game with a group that doesn't mind losing. It's actually often more fun to lose than to win. There's a lot of luck involved in how the mythos cards come up, what the mystery is...but there is also a lot of strategy in how your team collectively approaches problems and allocates resources. I really like the story this game tells, and I think the base game holds up to repeated plays without having to buy expansions.

First play was good; I'm not in love with it yet and I'm not sure it's better than Arkham either.  The decks (particularly the research deck) are a bit thin.   I've never been in love with an FFG game at first play though, and it's got me interested in playing again, so we'll see how the relationship develops.

A Lovecraft game that replaces all the ridiculous fiddliness of Arkham Horror. You need the expansions to bulk up the decks, though. I love how each game can be very different depending upon the Old One, and am impressed with the direction they are taking with the new boards. Maybe more Indiana Jones than Lovecraft, but usually still fun.

Update: ok, all the expansion stuff is bringing back the fiddle, but with organization it's manageable. I'm glad that you never play with everything at once.

Eldritch Horror is a simplified Arkham horror successor and has a lot of interesting global travel elements, but I find the earth map board is super boring.  Even though it's nearly ten years older, I still find the city layout of Arkham offers increased realism over the globe trotting sequel.  However, I do love the simplified mechanics and the global travel.  So I own both.  A future release with the global focus and the simplified mechanic of eldritch, but adding playable city maps for each location in the game while maintaining complexity at a reasonable level - That would be perfection.

Presentation captures the pulpy yet authentically sinister spirit of its source material without being distracting or pretentious.  Co-op structure lends itself well to solo play, including using multiple investigators.  The variety of cards, components and actions seems dizzying at first, but gameplay is actually straightforward and the game’s structure is sound.  Runs at a cinematic pace once you catch the hang of things.  And it’s appropriately difficult to win.  I fear I am doomed to acquire some expansions!  (A tip: always play with an even number of investigators to avoid “rounding up” penalties on expending clues and the like.)

Excellent co-op and theme. The game can be very lengthy especially with more players (2-4 hours). It has the perfect amount of difficulty and is quite rewarding on the times that you win. Great narration and artwork. Just be careful to not play it too much so you don't get sick of it.

RATING: 8
Pros:
- Flavor text is built into the game to create a neat story that encourages players to fill in the blanks.

- Random card draw everywhere adds to replayability.

- Fun character progression in terms of gaining increasing attributes, items, spells, and artifacts with unique character powers.

- Ancient ones come with unique cards to each enemy. Modular side boards and mechanisms can enhance experience once you get setup down quickly.

- Tokens and cards are good quality with evocative art and have a functional layout with easy to read text and iconography.

Cons: 

- Needs expansions to make it more replayable, but there are a lot to buy

- More players means a longer game unless you start resolving the encounter phase simultaneously when there are no impacts to others' choices. Also less reading of text aloud to share the experience since you need to keep the game moving briskly.

Summary:

Simply one of the best cooperative adventure style games out there with dice rolls for tests and powering up your character to face great evil.

This was once one of my favorite games that despite its large size (both in table size and play time) I would attempt to get it to the table every chance I could get. At the time I have it ranked as an 8/10. That was about a year ago and half ago. About six months ago I was looking at the newest expansion and was reminded how much I really liked the game. So I want about the laborious task of setting this game and going through the rules with my group (which took about an hour) we finally started to play. 

Now I know that this game is not supposed to be easy, and I can assure you that this time was one of the more difficult runs I have ever had, but something about it just feel flat. The other 3 people I played with are veteran gamers so it was not a case of "newbies" just not liking/getting it, but every thing we did in the game just felt so hollow. 

Every card, monster, dice roll and action felt empty and pointless. I think in the end we might just be more euro players, looking for more solid decisions and actions that feel more like our choices and not just random chance.

After only one play, I can't stop thinking about this game and when I'm going to get it to the table again.  I've read through the rules and reference guide each again and found a couple of small things that we didn't play correctly (like getting an encounter phase when you're delayed).

Another game from FFG with quality components.

Played a four player game.

This is a game that plays you. Pick a card, roll some dice, pass or fail, follow the instructions.

I found it incredibly boring. By the end of the night we were laughing hysterically. I wasn't sure it was because of the pure randomness or was it because our sanity was being tested, either way I felt like I was brain dead by the time we called quits on this game. 

I don't want to see the game again. It's four hours I'll never get back.

The story this game tells each time you play is pretty entertaining.  There is a great chance that you, and the rest of the world, will be devoured by a great old one by the time a round of this game ends, but the sheer amount of Lovecraftian goodness in this game makes it fun to break out every now and then.

This game, like many others based on the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft develops a very strong narative of the characters being whisked around the board.

There is an immense amount to this game. There's always something happening, and usually it's the game trying to obliterate the mind and/or body of the players' avatars.

It's an extraordinarily challenging game, which makes it very rewarding to win.

As an Arkham Horror fan, Eldritch is just far easier to get into.  This sort of replaces Arkham Horror for me.  Still a long game with a harrowing setup and brutal difficulty but, all in all a great step up from Arkham.

Overall, a very good re-make of Arkham Horror. The changes are really well done, incorporating a lot of very good ideas. The game seems a bit easier than Arkham Horror to win, and it also seems easier to introduce new players to. It still takes a few hours to play (more than what they say on the box) and it does have a problem with scaling (not at all managed well for more players).
But Fantasy Flight has let greed/stinginess ruin what could be a very excellent game. Aside from just being more than blatantly obvious that FF has left themselves more than enough space (a gaping void?) to fill with numerous expansions, they have really skimped on the contents of the core game.  
Aside from the painfully obvious limited replay-ability of the main objectives (Elder Gods), repetition quickly sets in due to the small number of location and item/ally cards. It is common to cycle through all the cards in an area/region, and/or the item deck, more than once (especially if certain characters are played) in a single game. Duplicates of certain items would be nice (especially if they are the starting items of some characters), but more item/condition/spell/location cards in general would be ... are actually really necessary. (For instance, there aren't even enough Blessed or Cursed condition cards to go around in a 4 player game -- and this is a situation that has happened to us more than once.)
The basic/glaring downside of Eldritch Horror is the limited number of game components, for what is supposed to be the major core game. Not screwing their customers on that alone would really have made it a more robust game. The flood of expansions that I'm sure FF has planned may help with replay in terms of the over-arching plots and goals, but I hope they realize that they will also have to provide more basic components to help the regular game-play seem less repetitive. It's a shame they didn't supply more base game components, something to give the game a lifespan of more than 8 or so plays (if only FF hadn't cheaped out on this basic element). 
(I have played the game 4 times now, the obvious areas of repetition are already kind of a (tedious) joke, but replay now involves selecting an Elder God for a 2nd play thru and, if things are optimal, that will be an experience of 66% repetition.)
Unless you can pick this game up cheap (along with a REALLY GOOD expansion or 2), I can't really say that this game is worth it.

One 6-player game. We lost after a little more than 3 hours, and weren't close to winning. If we hadn't lost, we probably would've packed it in. This is the kind of game that's fun if everyone keeps moving, but can be really excruciating if not. Downtime of up to 10 minutes between turns is WAY too much for this kind of game -- there just isn't that much to think about.

That said, I would play it again, but would make sure up front that everyone was prepared to keep the pace brisk.

I am fan of Lovecraft for years, so it's only natural that i LOVE game which is inspired by his works. Streamlined and simplyfied re-implementation of Arkham Horror, which even Jane enjoys and can immerse into.

Not my favorite coop, but good fun in the right group.
NOT good at higher player counts, our first attempts at playing this game were at 6 players, both games were aborted due to boredom around the table; however, my wife and I enjoy it with two players, and I suspect it's probably good with 3 or 4 as well.

I suspect that playing more than 4 is only fun if everybody already has a positive opinion of the game; but it falls flat in big groups otherwise.

Just what it's supposed to be: Arkham Horror streamlined. Plays super-smooth and quick with all of the randomness and RPG lite (very, very lite) goodness of the original. 

I love the new mechanics, flipping cards, etc. Vast improvement over the original.

EDIT: Starting to wonder if, in trimming the fat from Arkham Horror, they didn't cut a little too close to the bone...

Edit: Sold. Final analysis: a paper-thin rpg with little agency. Roll 5's and 6's and you win.

Edit: Played a friend's copy. The content is so extraordinary. I am still so frustrated that it's tied to the most trite of mechanisms: roll d6 and find out if you lose. This should have been one of my favorite games.

3 or 4 plays so far, we have yet to win.  I actually greatly appreciate that in a game...winning should be a reward, not a given.

Wish there was more variety in the box for the various locations, but I know that the expansions that I am inevitably going to get will help to resolve that.

On the plus side, my significant other is willing to play this, and honestly, this is likely her gateway into more complicated games, so +1 for that alone.

It's easier to control the round than AH - simply - there is less things to control (for the moment - probably expansions will change it). Storyline works. Mechanic is almost identical to the one from AH. The difference is similar like between Descent 1 and Descent 2.

This is a much-tightned-up up rehash of Arhkam horror. It is far from a strategy game: you wander around and draw random cards, which instruct you to roll dice tests against stats you can't predict.

It is on the whole a bearable game, which is a vast improvement over its awful forebearer Arkham Horror. But it's a far cry from something like Pandemic.

RATING: 9
Another great Cthulhu game from Fantasy Flight that lands somewhere between Mansions of Madness and Arkham Horror both in feel and in epicness.  My favorite feature is the way the mysteries and research cards are different for each Ancient One, giving the whole game a slightly different flavor for each AO.

HOWEVER, all this talk about EH "replacing" Arkham Horror is poppycock. Poppycock, hooey and malarkey I say!  EH is a tighter design than AH, but this also means the game is more constrained and presents fewer possibilities.  It is not really all that less fiddly than AH either.  Having to check every game component for reckoning effects makes the Mythos phase almost as much of a hassle as AH.  The influence roll to get items can be just as frustrating as trying to get money to buy items in AH, maybe more so because you can't accumulate successes.  Now you need to track damage on the monsters.  I miss taking the multi-turn journeys through the other worlds.  I also feel like EH splits your attention between tasks more than AH.  You can't just focus on the gates, monsters, and occasional rumors like in AH.  Now you have to deal with the mysteries as well.  And getting across the board can take forevers.  You can't just boost your speed and run for it like in AH.

I think that a lot of the flight to EH from AH comes from people who have overexpanded their AH and lost sanity points as a result.  If you eat yourself sick at the buffet, that's not the buffet's fault, people! :)  

I can see EH being a good option for those who are new to this genre.  EH feels about like AH + the revised Dark Pharoah in complexity.
 
That being said, EH is a great game that reworks the AH premise into a more compact but also less epic format while incorporating some of the features from MoM.  EH, AH, and MoM will all coexist happily on my shelf, and I am very picky about which games get to live on my shelf.

UPDATE Nov 2014:
I've been really enjoying playing this solo. 
I can run 3 characters without trouble, but I'm finding the game very difficult I win this way. While clues are plentiful, "# investigators/2 (rounded up) = 2, which makes the mysteries tough.  I'll try 2 characters next and see if I fare any better.

I mostly play it alone. So far, it is the only game that can enchant me for 3,5 hours. Time flies by when playing Eldritch Horror. Every game is different, however, after 8 plays, I ordered a first small box expansion to shake things up a little.
The biggest negative point is that I don't get it to the table so often because it only works with people who want to invest a lot of time and effort in enjoying the game. If you are only halfly interested, then this is hell. But if you are captivated by what happens where, how are we going to solve it, who should do what when, then this is an awesome experience.
Best experience of my last game:
1/9 chance that I would succeed two sequential 'tests'. I did. Yes I shouted and felt like I won the lottery. Awesome.

While this is a fun game to play with your friends, I was surprised to find this got a better rating than the original Arkham Horror. While it is a bit more streamlined, it doesn't have the atmosphere Arkham does. Arkham had the immediate terror, monsters blocking your way, gates opening, a feeling you could never win. Eldritch seemed tame in comparison. Monsters didn't provide much hindrance, and you had to go out and seek terrors, rather than them surrounding you. Most of the time it was, 'Gee, what should I do this turn'. As I feel atmosphere is vitally important, I don't rank Eldritch Horror very highly.

Easy to follow, and the attention to detail is impeccable.  While very slow to get through the first play through or two, the payoff is worth it.  A very cohesive story with a challenging set of changing parameters.  Even though there are many expansions to this series, the base game offers enough different characters and monsters for many play-throughs.

RATING: 9
Arkham Horror was always a game that to me felt too abstracted, felt too obtuse. In the end I sent off to greener pastures via trade. Enter Eldritch Horror that by and large plays a lot like Arkham. Where Eldritch surpasses Arkham is connecting what was happening with the game components. Everything felt intuitive and made sense. I didn't have to ask myself "Well what does this abstract?" Though it lost some of the deeper game elements, stuff that appeals to the more mechanical hard-core crowd got lost having everything feeling like it makes sense mean it will end up with much more play compared to Arkham.

Big Lovecraft fan, and no game has done a Cthulu mythos game as well as Eldritch Horror. I'm excited every time I get to turn over a card. One day, I might even beat Azathoth and move onto a different Old One!

For me, this game fixed my issue with co-operative games. I tend to rank co-operative low, because I tend to mentally shutdown during them as a tactic to avoid Alpha gaming. This results in me being consistently bored through-out the game.  Eldritch Horror cuts through this limitation of mine, but making my own gameplay independently important to the goal. Rather than needing flawless co-ordination, each player carries out their own investigation with bigger-picture objectives.

(Maybe this reduced co-ordination is why we never win... No matter! I'll keep on playing the way that's fun for me and my group!)

RATING: 7
This fits into an odd space.  It's not quite as long as Arkham, but almost.  (It's close enough that I don't know that I'd ever want to play this when I wouldn't want to play its sister game.)  It's a little more manageable, and you perhaps feel like you have more control.  More of the information is open, certainly.  I like the fact that the Mythos deck is seeded in stages, so you don't wind up with a bunch of super-hard cards coming out at once.  
Ultimately, though, it's still about the roll of the dice.  In a way, this is worse than Arkham, because almost all of the goals revolve around turning in clue tokens.  In that game, you can just walk around and pick them up, but in this one you have to pass an encounter to do so.  If you have events that fail to put out clues where you can get to them or you just get unlucky at picking them up, the game can slide towards defeat and there's nothing you can do about it.

A lot of the design touches are nice.  Conditions/spells are double-sided and different on the back, so you know that something bad will happen but not exactly what.  Each boss has a way that it affects the game and a stack of missions ('mysteries') that play along with that.  This means games will play out differently instead of being a race to seal gates.
However, the base game decks of encounters and mysteries are awfully thin, so you'll be seeing repeats a lot.

This is my favourite game of all time! Yes, it can be a bit punishing and whatever you do don’t try more than four players. That said, the game excels from a thematic standpoint, is rewarding in victory, has great replayability (as long as you have at least Foresaken Lore), and the solo play is identical to the group play. Just make sure you have a bit of room to spread out and a few hours to kill (the time estimates are well low unless you don’t talk to anyone or read any flavour text).

Co-op, Heavy

I love this as a dice chucking overly thematic co-op game.  The setup can be a pain if you just bag everything and it takes up a ton of table space.  I don't have one but this game really needs a card holding tray/rack that saves table space.  I've enjoyed every expansion so far and I love that they aren't going with the Arkham Horror direction by making expansions drastically change gameplay.  Pretty long at about 45-50mins per player, down time isn't too bad as you are generally table talking in between turns.  Pretty difficult to boot which a co-op needs to be.

Having been a fan of Arkham horror for years so when I saw this it was a must play at BGGcon. We had a demo Fantasy Flight and then later picked the game out of the library. From one play a few things are obvious: It's smoother than Arkham Horror. Rules are clearer. It's more engaging. All in all it's likely to keep people's attention longer and keep them in the game so that completing it becomes less of a task and more of a game. This is a great game.

Imagine Pandemic but more awesome. Instead of bland art in Pandemic you get masterful awesome art that is common with FF games. Instead of *yawn* virus outbreaks you get awesome Lovecraftian mythos chaos pop up. And imagine if Pandemic then had 200 more rules and little specialties that make you constantly grab the reference book to make sure you are doing it right....okay so it is a give and take.

Awesome game but one of those games that the family rarely wants to play because you have to remember 300 different rules and special skills to get the most out of forming a plan to stop the DOOOOOOM.  I personally love it but convincing the people I play with to get it out is almost as hard as beating the Elder gods threatening the world in this game.

It's a fun game but too long and too text centric.  Because of the length, I don't play it enough to remember all the rules, and I always end up missing a few things on rules rereads, making the game a little rough, and probably longer than it would normally run.  So is it actually long?  Or do I just not play it enough?  Questions, questions, questions....

This is a great adventure game; sort of Indiana Jones meets HP Lovecraft. The base box benefits from the small box expansions to flesh out the location encounters.
I've greatly enjoyed this game as a solo experience as well.

After having played AH more, I need to update my comment on this. AT first I thought it was a better version of the game, but now I think it stands slightly below the original. The game feel is mostly the same as in AH, but I'd much rather walk the Arkham streets than taking trains and boats around the world. Makes more sense for the original source of the theme to me. Also, maybe it was all streamlined at the beginning, but at this point there are so many expansions and cards that the setup is is basically the same as AH, so one of the original 'advantages' this game had is not there anymore. In any case, EH is also a game I enjoy a lot.

RATING: 9
I think AH is harder to explain, so AH is a game that usually stays in the top of my closet, instead, EH is a game that improves AH mechanics, and the rule book is much more Simple to explain to the other players, making it easy that from minute one, the rest of the players involved in the game. If you want a game to introduce to this complex world of lovecraft and a future player of AH, you must buy this EH.

RATING: 8.5
I've only played this 5 times, but so far this fires Arkham Horror. I love that game, but this cuts down on some of the more irritating book keeping aspects (terror track, monster limits, monster moving, character sliders, the upkeep phase in general).

It does this whilst retaining depth and variety. There's a lot to praise, but I'd single the reckoning mechanic out for particular attention. A fantastic and simple idea that adds surprise and tension to every game.

There is plenty of variety in the base set, but you'll quickly want Forsaken Lore. This is mainly for additional encounter cards, in the same way that Arkham required Dunwich.

Buy this.

Seriously long, there is a lack of cards which means you should ideally purchase this with an expansion asap, and despite reduced complexity, I actually preferred Arkham Horror to this one. I can't remember why as I played this one a while ago, but as mainly a card game player, I'm not one for long amertrash games.

I've been spending a lot of time and money to properly pimp this game out.  I've purchased the investigator figures from Fantasy Flight, and more plastic stands to use for the gates and epic monsters.  Really cool to see everything set up.

The jury is still out on whether I like this or Arkham Horror more; I need to play this more. I do like the world-hopping, and the streamlining that has occurred here, but I'm not sure that it doesn't come at the expense of atmosphere and intimacy. I also like that AH has more read-the-card adventures in it, although the overall narrative here is probably more cohesive, given that each Ancient One has cards that are specific to it, rather than one large pool of cards that never changes in AH.

My binge playing game. Once it hits the table, it doesn't get put away until a game is won - sometimes that means 8 hours of Cthulu. I am almost afraid to expand it, contrary to what other say, I feel the contents of the box are complete and need no more encumbrance.

Rated based solely on 2-players. I really wouldn't want to make this game longer.

Seems like it would be a phenomenal solo game.

Dice were somewhat irritating but the pass/fail system with rolling many dice wasn't as bad as more traditional dice systems.

Still limited in my mind as a pure co-op, but the greater depth and thematic experience overcomes that hurdle a little better than the Leacock games I've played.

This game is HARD! We've played the "beginner" monster/scenario/thing twice and got stomped both times! It's definitely a solid game but it takes some investment.  It's a decently long play and there is just so much you have to keep track of. Our last game went for 3-4 hours with 5 players. It can be slightly disappointing to invest all that time and collectively lose, but a lot of the game is wrapped up in the journey and all the fun/funny things that happen throughout it. Not a bad experience at all, but I think i'd rather play a shorter, less complicated co-op like pandemic instead of investing 3-4 hours in an unsuccessful journey. Co-ops aren't my favorite cup of tea, but I did still enjoy it!

Similar game to Arkham horror but with some simplified mechanics and more importantly it adds soooo much theme. The GOOs are now very different and require different approaches/strategies to defeat. Your characters travel all over the world, gain skills, gain weapons, get injured, go mad - in short, the game builds narrative as you progress. And the expansions i have so far have only added to that depth. Looove this game.

Wish I could play this more as I am still undecided on it. I have not had chance to play with any expansions but would like to do so.

9 is rating for solitaire Eldritch Horror. As a cooperative game it is 7 for me.

EDIT: After many plays game is becoming slightly repetitive. This game is really good but needs expansions to prolong replayability.

2nd EDIT: Sold, Eldritch Horror went down the same path as Descent 2nd edition - mediocre, cut down, limited game that needs constant stream of new expansions to maintain replayability - I won't follow the same path again. Game sold.

3rd EDIT: Bought again, this time with all expansions (this damn Cthulhu itch), great game - true ameritrash where stories told are more important than mechanics, but be warned though - it needs a lot of costly expansions to show true potential.

For the most part, I've moved on from what I call MERSC games (move, explore, roll for skill check) as I look for more sophistication in my solo/coop games. I can see through the veil of the experience rather quickly when all we’re doing is rolling for skill checks with a bunch of cards that modify our rolls. And neither do I want to rely on expansion chasing to keep the experience fresh, but (wait for it)… I like this game and series of expansions.

Admittedly, a big part of the reason is that the genre is a huge attraction for me. I love the [blogpost=27416]Lovecraftian Yog Sothothery[/blogpost] quite a bit and enjoy a game facilitating a story about it. Also, I firmly believe that a Lovecraftian game should be cooperative and not competitive because once you introduce a competitive situation, the theme of inevitable madness, chaos, and futility underlying the genre goes out the window because people want to win. It shouldn’t get anywhere near that but rather everyone enjoying when things going horribly wrong. Can’t argue it’s not thematic!

So, those are my ideological reasons for liking the game, as to the game itself, it’s streamlined to my tastes. EH tells me a story with a modicum of rules and keeps the action flowing without a lot of downtime or management of the AI. I like Mansions of Madness for the way it provides a sense of mystery, and EH offers at least a taste of that with double-sided cards where you get something that may flip over at some point to the consequence side and then you have to deal with that. There’s some intelligence built into the game such that mummies appear at the Pyramids and other monsters act thematically to keep the theater of it all intact. And sometimes the cards just align like finding the Crystal of the Elder Gods at the Temple of the Elder Things (ooh, spooky how that happened!). 

From what I see, some people prefer the added rules chrome of AH, and some of us prefer the streamlining of EH. Rather than argue over which is best, fans of Lovecraft should marvel that we have these choices. Fans of other genres envy how many Cthulhu games there are. Their genres live in shacks while we have mansions (of madness!).

Note: If you don’t have the Mountains of Madness expansion, you still must play with the Focus rules; download the rulebook.

Everything that's Arkham Horror, just better: faster play, more streamlined rules, and a wider variety of things to do (unlike Arkham's "Enter Gate. Exit Gate. Close Gate. Repeat a number of times."). The only thing that prevents me from rating this game higher is the relatively low amount of Encounter cards, which tends to make the game a little repetitive on that side. This game is definetly a 9 with a few expansions thrown in.

This is a hard game to rate. There is a lot of luck in this game and it is long. On a bad day the game beats the tar out of you and it can be frustrating. Otherwise this game is perfect, and I am mostly rating it as I feel about it on a good day. It is hard, takes a lot of calculated risks and teamwork to win, and you never know what is going to happen. I especially love all the different characters and monsters. Every game feels like a new experience, and the story lines are fascinating. A really great mystery!

Streamlined-but-not-necessarily-quicker version of Arkham Horror.

I don't miss focus management too much.  Both games have the same issue as all "experience" games like this; sometimes you draw a card that tests a stat you suck at, and there isn't a whole lot you can do.  In EH the clues are *much* harder to come by so you almost never want to burn them for a lowly reroll.

I like both games though.

A globe trotting scramble to stop the Elder Gods from awakening whilst struggling with your own sanity!
There's a lot going on in this game, but the way it plays is pretty simple even if the game puts up one hell of a fight.
Damn good game!
Updated : This was back when I made the transition from Arkham to Eldritch. In more recent years I've moved away from games like this. After giving it a go recently I found there is still a big time investment and not enough reward. Perhaps the expansions offer more layers regarding what you can do, but to move and have stuff happen at you is fine, just not for 4 hours. No, Elder Sign isn't the answer either.

RATING: 4.2
[b]Sold 2017-3-27[/b]  For all the reasons listed below.  I got my fun out of the game for sure, and will still play if friends request with their copies, but this ain't one I need to own anymore.

[b]Updated 2015-12-19[/b] After 14 plays, I am pretty much completely over Eldritch Horror.  "Spend three hours rolling dice to see if you win or not" is just not appealing to me anymore.  The novelty has worn completely off, the story elements are not worth the pain of all the fiddliness, and I pretty much can't wait for games to be over.  I may play it again if I get into a very specific mood, but in general I would be happy to never see this game again.  Downgraded from a 6.7 to a 4

[b]Comments as of 2015-8-14[/b] I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Eldritch Horror.  I love the epic scale, the grandiose story you tell together with your friends while battling unspeakable horrors.  I love the feeling of starting as a desperate professor or sailor who somehow learned a bit too much, then trying to gear up and learn new skills to try to take on this terrible darkness.

I hate the dice.  Like, really, really hate them.  I hate how you can get everything completely right, make amazing decisions and have things on the verge of victory, and then a bad roll on the most mundane undertaking can totally throw you off kilter.  I hate that, in order to do all of that awesome leveling up, you have to simply roll well for it, and if you spend just a few turns trying to level up but failing your rolls, you're pretty much hosed.

When the dice rolls obey the general trends of probability - that is, you succeed some, but fail more, the game works amazingly well.  It tells a great story of trying to overcome an insurmountable task, and whether you lose or win, you feel like you've traversed the world trying to save it.

When the dice rolls are simply crap, though, the game turns into a boring slog.  You don't feel like you're on an epic quest, you feel like a loser who can't manage to convince somebody to sell you a stinking handgun even though you've tried multiple times.  When you aren't able to get geared up, to take on those epic battles, because you fail at the simplest, most menial of tasks, it feels less like a game and more like an exercise in futility.  It seems like approximately a quarter of my games have gone this way.  I keep bringing Eldritch Horror back to the table knowing that I'll probably have a good time, but when it falls flat, it falls hard.

I don't usually do .5 ratings, but this game is precisely Arkham +.5. That is to say, if I were forced to play one or the other, this is clearly the better version. It's streamlined considerably, and plays faster. 

It's still the same boring game at the core, though. Stumbled around, get buffeted by fate, play a really long, involved co-op that feels like setting up for at least an hour as cards come out and go immediately to waste.

I really really enjoyed this game and it is actually very different from arkham whilst having the same flavour and similar mechanics.

The game can drag a little if you find you are unable to make progress towards uncovering the mysteries and the clues are much more difficult to acquire than those in arkham which can lead to difficulties but over all I really like this aspect where you have a specific 'clue' encounter. But failing to uncover the mysteries doesn't mean you cannot achieve victory. 

It is a little longer than base arkham is but this may just be due to our unfamiliarity with it currently.

I have played Arkham Horror for years. I have played Eldritch Horror 3 times with experienced players of Arkham Horror, and we never won it yet, although we came very close to winning it once. It almost seems like the rules are designed to make you lose. So I guess I am kind of perplexed by this game... why can't we win the game? I have been playing various types of board games for years, and there has never been a game that we played 3 times and couldn't win it. So I feel pretty frustrated with this game, and I'm not sure how I feel about playing it again. I almost want to see someone else win (people I know) before I play it again to prove the game is actually winnable. 
Apart from the not being able to win the game thing, it is generally a fun game to play. It's just frustrating to work so hard and get killed every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Pros
-Better than AH (streamlined play/easier to manage rules, shorter/pre-determined game length, logical win path and actions you take are not made redundant if AO wakes, less bookkeeping, more tension)
-Incorporates MoM style random effects from conditions, spells etc. 
-Allows for teamwork, but also allows for solo play
-Varied game-play / approach to winning depends on Ancient One you are facing.
-(to be verified) Decent difficulty level (I prefer harder games).

Cons
-Alpha player potential problem
-Desperately needs an expansion (barely enough encounter cards in box) - as is, expect somewhat lower long term replayability
-No miniatures despite high price (but otherwise good component quality as per FFG)
-Events are still fairly unpredictable, leading to attribute tests being somewhat random (unless you memorize what is at each location)
-Mysteries for each AO that needs to be completed are somewhat similar. Could have used more innovation.

RATING: 8
This streamlining of Arkham Horror seems excellent, though some of the decks are a bit thin.

Old Ones have custom mythos deck compositions that change as the game progresses (variety, coherence, and narrative), as well as custom quest cards. Instead of closing gates you have to accomplish special missions to win (though closing gates gains you some respite).

I really like the modularity of the Old Ones - it seems an improvement over the deck dilution issues in Arkham Horror, and I hope FFG can maintain this level of design as the expansions come out.

There are fewer phases, no sliders, money or elder signs, allies and items have been merged, cities state what their encounters tend to do, monsters stay put, and effects only occur on reckonings, which simplifies bookkeeping.

I hope that at least the initial expansions flesh out the existing decks and mechanics rather than adding more.

I agree with some of the criticisms:
* decks are thin
* "Delay" is a stupid lose-a-turn mechanic
* "Shuffle back in a solved mystery" is execrable

I love this game because it is fun to play. Each player's character feels so different because of their abilities but also because of the decisions that they make and the experiences that they have. The bad guys feel quite different too. I am always, always up for this game.

Often feels like there are no meaningful choices and the players are simply along for the ride. However, theme is very strong. Solo play offers a more rewarding experience than multiplayer due to a few factors. Time constraints don't force play to be sped up where one player is beginning their action while another is finishing their's causing story detail to be lost. With a solo game the player can run several investigators which alleviates the problem of a player missing the action in a game due to random chance of where things occur.

I prefer Arkham Horror over this one but if I want to visit the world of H.P Lovecraft but have less time I will play this one instead of Arkham. It is by no means a short game, just shorter then Arkham. It is more streamlined and it is easier to learn and to play but I feel this comes at the cost of how invested you feel in the story that unfolds. I do like the combat and I do like that you can improve the stats of your characters. I also think that the focus tokens(from Forsaken Lore) should have been in the game from the start.

With Mountains of Madness and Forsaken Lore.

Considering that Arkham Horror is one of my all-time favorite board games, it was tough to objectively play this one.  With streamlined rules + set-up, the same great flavor, and much challenging game play, this one ranks right up there with Arkham.  With more expansions, this rating can only go up.

Elsőre kifejezetten tetszett. Mondjuk a 3 fő nem volt éppen ideális létszám, kicsit elvesztünk a pályán, de nagyon hangulatos volt. Kérdés, hogy  pár játék, és a kártyák flavorjének megismerése után nem válik-e uncsivá. Nomeg valamiért nem éreztem azt a jellegű feszültséget, borotvaélen táncolást, mint amit vártam. Nem mondom, hogy simán nyertünk, mert egy-két körön múlott, de valahogy nem volt meg ez az "oda-vissza, épphogy megvan, lehet, hogy mégsincs" feeling, mint ami mondjuk a pandemicnél megvan.

3-asban lement 3 óra alatt úgy, hogy mindenki newbie volt.

Kicsit nehezen tervezhető a játékidő, nomeg gond az, hogy mire gördülékenyen mennének a dolgok, mert mindenkinek a kisujjában vannak a szabályok, addigra megunjátok a sztorit. Ezt feloldani, csak gyakorlott játékos melletti játékkal lehet, akinek még van cérnája arra, hogy a newbiek szívesen olvasgatják a flavour texteket, és nem csak csekkek dobálnak egymás után ész nélkül.

I knew this wasn't my kind of game, but after actually playing it...OMG. So much downtime. So much tedium. So few meaningful decisions. So low a level of *anything* interesting or compelling. Ick, ick, ick. 

There were some clever mechanisms. Too bad they were used in such an ultimately dreadful game.

Also, in a game where rolling 5, 6, or 7+ dice is not particularly uncommon, why on earth would FFG only include 4 dice? The less-than-a-quarter that FFG saved by shorting the dice really speaks of misplaced priorities.  :/

Arkham Horror retooled to be more straightforward - still fiddly,  but less so. still rules intensive, but less so. It is a story telling engine with game decisions that have relevant, thematic consquences. It is a hard feat to pull off. While still a pain in the ass to set up and know completely that we are following the rules, it is very fun to play.

RATING: 8
I love this game. From the way it distills its theme, to its simple and fun game mechanics, to its impressive replay value, to its stellar components, everything about Eldritch Horror feels right. The game does a great job at always keeping you on the edge, throwing rumors and opening gates all around the world, so that you always have to make hard and interesting choices. Where the system really shines is in the synergy it creates between adventurers with very different skills and backgrounds. While the muscle will keep the monsters at bay, the brain will investigate and work at solving the mysteries. It's one of the rare games that give me such a sense of immersion without forgetting the fun and strategy. If you like adventure and mystery, Indiana Jones and Lovecraft, then look no further.

The adventure/horror game to get with some wonderful storytelling mechanics to it. I recommend this over Arkham Horror as it increases the scale of things happening across the globe & streamlines a lot of the Arkham Horror rules (on things like money for example) while keeping the importance on the story with the approaching doom.

RATING: 9
A solid game with lots of theme, I simply love it. The game can be very punishing with bad dice rolls, lots of pressure by the doomtrack and certain mythos cards inplay. It can be very frustrating, but thats how the game works. So if you are a competitive player, like I am, you have to switch your mindset, and just follow the ride of this great adventure and experience, whether you are winning or losing. :)

This game has inspired me to go out and buy all of HP Lovecraft's work. It is so interesting and enthralling and enveloping, and if his literature is anything like this game, I need to read it. Tension in everything you do. It is perceivably possible to have a alpha gamer, but there are so many things on the board and so many choices that they would often probably be wrong. Almost feels like a sandbox game with the number of choices they give you. And I love the skill check system, one of my favorite mechanics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Whenever the game asks for a skill check, passing or failing is based upon the number of successes in a dice roll where the dice count is dependent upon the individual investigator's skill. While this reduces the frustration of rolling dice to some extent, it does not change that this is an awful dice fest.
On their turns, players effectively move and then they have an encounters on their locations. In order to complete the game, players must chase down clue tokens that generate randomly, which means that in many cases, players are going to sit in one location, trying to win a clue over and over again.
While various Old-Ones are available to pursue and they do change the rules of the game in clever ways, one runes through the number of cards supplied for each within a single game, rendering their variation a little moot as more than a single play results in narrative repetition.
If an Ameritrashian game such as this cannot even immerse its players, what value does it have?

Lends itself to storytelling and there's a good amount of strategy involved. The core game benefits from Forsaken Lore (raise replayability) and Strange Remnants (new mechanics and characters) expansions, the others are IMO overkill.

Plays reasonably well solo, suggested amount of players is below 4 or it might take too long to finish.

The more I play it, the more it becomes a lesson in frustration. Mythos cards are way too brutal and make you loose although you made no mistakes. Discarding all the clues you've collected during the last five turns? That's like saying "game over" when you're working on a mystery that requires tons of clues, and also bad game design. Reckonings are too fiddly too. Overall I still like the game ... kind of, but Arkham Horror is just so much better.

We got our butts beat at Gamestorm. I purchased the game after having played it. It was really fun, and less fiddly with parts then the Arkham Horror series. I want play... I WANT TO PLAY. Too many other games right now. Sorry Eldrich. 

I finally bought the game and played it on my own. Very nice game which I'll rank at a 10. The rule book is really well designed. You can find most of the answers you need from the reference book that comes with the rules. That reference is all alphabetical. My first solo game went smooth and I have fun losing the game due the really cool story behind all that happened. It doesn't look easy to beat, but simply playing it is very fun.

RATING: 9
An excellent sequel to the already great Arkham Horror.  While it isn't shorter than Arkham, it definitely improves on everything that was already working, while making something that still feels like a brand new game.

Eldritch's best new feature is double sided cards. Conditions and spells have multiple different versions, and certain game effects cause you to flip them over. When they're flipped, something unique to that card happens. It makes spell casting really interesting, and conditions are much more interesting than simply being cursed or blessed.

Another great aspect to the game, is that they made Artifact cards feel MUCH more unique and special. You can't just go to the store and buy artifacts anymore. When you get an artifact from a card effect (usually from entering gates), it is extremely rewarding.

Clues and Gates have been changed to be specific to locations on the game board. This means that you are much more likely to visit varying places in the game, rather than focusing on the locations that are beneficial despite the state of the game (like shops in Arkham). When a clue spawns, you get sent to not just cities, but small points in the middle of nowhere. Gates were further changed to no longer send you to a specific other world, which while slightly disappointing at face value does give you a lot more variety and surprise when you're drawing other world cards as encounters.

Eldritch also does a lot more to make the game feel unique to each elder god you face. Each god has it's own unique deck that you have encounters with to collect clues. However, these decks only have 8 cards, and over the course of the game you WILL go through that deck 3-4 times. The game is in desperate need for more variety in these elder god decks. Each card does have 3 different effects on it (City, wilderness, and sea) similar to Arkham having 3 effects per card for locations, but there still isn't enough variety in a single game. 

Unlike Arkham, where the focus is mostly on closing gates, the actual focus of Eldritch is solving mysteries. Each god has 4 mysteries, 3 of which must be solved to win the game. Mysteries give you unqiue uses for clues, or require you to time actions in the game with what "Omen" is currently in play.

Aside from the need for more elder god specific cards to add variety during a game, the biggest flaw of Eldritch is that some game effects cause you to "lose" an already solved mystery. This is by far the WORST mechanic any game could consider adding. It is one thing to have effects in the game that make it harder or that cause stress to the players, but actually losing progress is the complete opposite of fun. Especially when that "progress" is 1/3 of the entire game. I don't care if the game was balanced to expect you to complete 4 mysteries instead of 3, having one get stolen from you made us nearly want to quit the game. In our first game we went from 1/3 complete and starting on our second mystery, to being back to square one. At that point, we would have been better off quitting and restarting the game entirely.

The game is ripe for Expansions, and was clearly created with expansions in mind.  First and foremost, I really hope that the 4 elder god decks get more variety. Beyond that, more elder gods, more players, and more cards in general would be a huge boost to an already great game.


Edit: After playing a few more times, an overlooked rule has made the repetition of the research deck much less obvious. Originally we mixed clues back into the supply each time it was used, which meant we had duplicate clues showing up in the same game. This also meant that there were always more city clues in the supply than everything else, meaning when we went on research encounters we were seeing the same ones.

Once following the rules that state clues get discarded, and only put back in the supply when you run out, we found it much less likely to repeat the same exact encounters. There still needs to be more variety in the research decks, but it's not nearly as bad as it was during our first impression.

Beautiful game. It catches the sense of travelling all around the world.

I tried but there wasn't really a game in there, it was a laugh to start with and the banter was fun but that couldn't be kept going all night. All I did was read a few cards with, frankly, ludicrous text on them and roll some dice. I didn't really make any decisions.

It was if someone had taken a genre horror novel and torn every page out which was then read back in a random order with dice rolls at the end of each page.

I won't rate this 'game' as it's obviously not for me and others obviously like it.

RATING: 8
I've been playing a lot of this.  It really does solve a lot, but not all of, AH's problems.  In particular, it makes everything important again---you no longer pile up a thousand useless things that barely work (e.g. spells), even individual clues are important, die rolls never get to a point where they required 12 die rolls and cascades of successes.  It also rebalanced the characters better and sets a stronger balance between the utility of different attributes for tests.  My essential take on the AH vs. EH argument is that AH creates amazing unintended narrative that elevates it to an amazing story creator---but those stories are almost always micro stories about characters and situations and sometimes incoherent.  EH, by contrast, is a very intentional macro story creator for the entire game state.

Obviously the number one thing it does, which is succeeds at, is implementing card decks and details that make GOOs play differently.  It must have been a bit of a hard decision to devote 1/3 of the cards in the product to GOOs, only one of which will see play.  But it was the right decision.

I still have some issues with the game that I'm mulling over.  Monsters are both unimportant now but also endless, stacking up 3+ high frequently all over the board.  Multiple round combat makes things less random, but can also create a lot of frustrating delay as you grind monsters for multiple rounds.  Gates are difficult to close  (2+ successful tests, clues) but pop up at a rate that makes their closure seem/feel worthless.

So I've calibrated this at 8.5.  It may move up or down.  I don't think it'll ever hit the 10 with me that AH is, because its high highs aren't even close to the sublime, fun situations AH can put you in.  On the other hand, its lows aren't as low either.

Also, Forsaken Lore is essentially a requirement if you buy the base game and like it at all.

Edit: This game is dropping.  It's an 8 now down from a high of 9.5 in my 10-15 play honeymoon.  There is some serious unfun gotcha bullshit in this game on the mythos cards, tons of delay mechanics, etc.  This is a crying shame because mechanically, besides the reduction of dice thrown for checks making the game more random, this is a considerable improvement over AH.  But someone on the design team just has super lazy, unfuriating ideas for mythos cards and encounter punishments.

Nice streamlining of the Arkham Horror mechanics make for an engrossing thematic game that doesn't bog down with chrome. Love the mechanics of the spell and condition cards and flipping them over. You never know the true cost of a spell until you attempt to cast it. The combat mechanics are so much smoother than AH. The only downside to me is that there is just something fun and thematic when you're running around Arkham.

The most elegant mechanics and immersive theme of the FFG Lovecraftian games. Most of my plays have been solo with 4 investigators. EH reduced some of the Arkham Horror gameplay complexity regarding acquisition of resources and monster encounters while creating an AO-based story line from tailored mysteries, clue encounter and special encounters.  The emphasis on global encounters lacks some of town or regional character intimacy of Arkham (but is still representative of Lovecraft stories such as "Call of Cthulhu," "Shadow Out of Time," "At the Mountains of Madness" and others, as well as non-Lovecraft Mythos tales, such as as Bloch's Egypt stories and Howard's "The Black Stone").  This one has improved with its expansions and the proliferation of all materials , particularly a more diverse array of location encounters and investigator tools.  A great game, and a more elegant game than Arkham Horror, but not yet quite as rich.

Very fun game - this is what Arkham Horror could have been.  Feels like a truly global epic quest to save mankind - with each mythos having unique investigations to mysteries to solve.  Only problem with this game is there isn't enough of it!

It's just way too long and random. I generally dislike skill checks with low amounts of mitigation and there's far too little re-rolling in this game. Fun stuff happen around once per hour and that's just not enough. There's also not enough events even with expansions, so the same things repeat themselves too much.

Streamlined and improved version of Arkham Horror. Well crafted theme, modular design makes multiple play-throughs unique and opens the game up to multiple strategies. Quality components and a beautiful art design. It is cumbersome to teach to a newcomer, and takes a few plays to get all the rules down.

Overall an excellent game, heavy on theme without sacrificing game mechanics.

Have played this twice so far both times we found the text to be silly or funny rather than moody. The narrative is scattershot and has little continuity and the gameplay takes as long as AH ever did. I thought this was supposed to be the streamlined version. Very few cards for a base game. It could be that we need to play with people who are excited about this game but so far not converts.

RATING: 10
I don't own a lot of good tabletop games, but this one is perfect for me hence the score. I'm a big fan of Lovecraft's works and obsessed with the 20s so I love the theme and story of this game. I got into board gaming over a year ago but haven't been tempted to get a new game yet, choosing instead to buy expansions for it because it's so fun. I own all expansions except for Signs of Carcosa which I should be getting in a few days.

The best aspect of this game is its great theme but I also like the strategy of it. When playing alone for hours its pretty intense as I study every action and possibility to see if and how I can win. All my 10 plays are solo except the most recent one which I played with my family. They're not board gamers so they didn't exactly get the hang of it but also didn't notice a lot of strategy so don't get it if you want it purely for that. It's a very competent solo game, I always play with 4 investigators now. This game is more story than strategy though so I imagine it would be very fun to play with friends who may like Lovecraft or games like this to have a laugh and make things more interesting.

As a word of warning, a good portion of encounters is just luck. You can gamble and strategize to have the odds be in your favor but sometimes the dice just won't let you win. Take our most recent game with 3 players as an example. An already hard and odd number of investigators, we drew the All for Nothing mythos (shuffle solved mystery back in) without the clues to stop it. We were able to solve three mysteries total and were so close to the last. We were playing Azathoth and the final mystery required us to discard six clues total in Tunguska after an observation test. We let the gates go because we thought we'd win before the doom got to 0 but nope. For two turns in a row I attempted the observation test (with Joe Diamond no less) plus an ally and a reroll the second time for a total of 11 dice rolled hoping for a single 1/3 chance success. Didn't get it either time and lost with nothing we could do to change the result further. That stuff stinks but it was still an interesting conclusion to a fun game.

With all the money I've spent on it I still get an average of $5 per hour of gameplay which is better than a lot of media. That number is higher than it should be though as I've taken long breaks between sessions and only play one or a couple sessions before buying another expansion, to the point where I haven't even fought two AOs and haven't beaten half of them.

RATING: 7
Good modular story driven american style game with dice roling.
1st game - 2 pl. - Azathoth - win - about 180 mins incl. Setup - fun
 Even with just two players the game is long, therefore I think I would refuse to play it with more than three players.  Playing EH with the max. amount of 8 players would result in ridiculously high downtime!
Having wrote this;
2nd game - 6 pl - Cthullhu - lost - 240mins - horrible
Yes, as assumed downtime becomes a big fun killer. Furthermore as long as you wait another player may trigger an effect that you lose some health or sanity (felt strange). Therefore our investigators died more than once.... Another fun killer.
3rd game - 3 pl - Yig - win - 180mins - 2hrs fun, last hour dragged a bit.

In general I like this game. But you can be "stoppped"  meaning you lose a turn, this may also happen two times in a row.   Losing a turn just means that the game will go on for longer so this is a very cumbersome mechanism that does nothing but weaken the fun.

Played a solo adventure with a random character. An Actress. Well I was facing Shub Niggurath and I was well over the second mystery and trying to solve the third and final one, when the Mother actually awoke. But I didn't get to see Her in all her majesty because a Dark Pact came to fruition and I was sacrificed to Her many mouths. 

What can I say? Mythos hunting is not for the Dilettante. ;)

That said it has been a long game, slow going and not all that much fun. I hope that playing with some people the experience may improve. So here's my "7" tentative rating. We'll see. 

UPDATE
This is a significantly long game to play. Unfortunately as it is, it can only be an afternoon or pre-dinner game. This will reduce the number of times it will hit the table, unfortunately. 

That said I liked how some of the mechanics gave me a narrative of the setting, so I'll take this up half a notch.

RATING: 9
Thus far the best coop game I've played. I love the globe-trotting, Indiana Jones experience. I love the encounter phase where something different happens every time. I love the different investigators, the standees, all of the equipment, spells and conditions you can get. I love the Cthulhu theme and the 1920-30's jazzy setting. Above all I really love that you can easily play this solo, justifying (to a degree) all the money I've spent on this game.

The component quality is great, especially the linen finish on the cards.

Two aspects of this game that you have to accept: the randomness and the duration of a game. The game has a lot of dice rolling with few ways to mitigate the luck factor, aside from rolling more dice. On top of that the Mythos deck can either make the game quite easy or super difficult when build using the standard rules. As for the duration: I have only played 1 game of EH that was under 3 hours. Every other game has been around 4 hours, not including setup. 

Issues: 
- lack of dice: the game only comes with 4 dice which is just way too few
- no bag or cup for the monster and clue tokens. You need to provide these yourself so you can randomly draw one when the game asks you to. 
- no insert and not enough plastic bags, so storage is a problem
- without expansions the base game will feel repetitive after roughly 5/6 plays

All of these problems can be fixed with money. I've bought extra dice, monster and clue bags, build my own insert and own all of the expansions. As a minimum I think you have to invest in plastic bags, dice and buy the Forsaken Lore expansion.

The one thing I've felt missing from Eldritch Horror that money can't buy is closure. When you solve a mystery or beat an Ancient One nothing happens. There is no text to read, nothing that celebrates your success. I don't expect music or balloons, a few lines of story would suffice. Sadly this is completly lacking so you just have to make it up yourself. 

I will wholeheartedly recommend Eldritch Horror, just not the naked base game.

The theme comes through strong for me. I love Lovecraft and the little stories on the cards (although painfully short in most cases) keep me engaged with this game. I just love it.

Gameplay is something between Battlestar Galactica (in terms of the way the turn is structured), Pandemic (in the global movement and goals), and Arkham Horror (in event and conflict resolution).  Intricate and complex gameplay mitigated by an easy to understand rulebook that keeps the choices a player can make relatively straightforward.  Not short by any means, but would probably scale well with different numbers of players.  Really looking forward to playing this one again soon.

When my wife and first received this game we (I) were excited. Then we played it and then the excitement dissipated. It was a lot to take in there are a lot of events going on so much to get a grasp on. So we played it a few times and gradually got the hang of it, now we play about once a week ( only the 2 of us, currently living in the middle of nowhere) and are really getting into it. We work together trying to come up with strategies, even during the week it might popup in conversation on how to defeat..... It is a great co-op game it may take a bit of playing to really get into but once you have the hang of it you will love it. I give it a 9. Also just received the expansion so will be adding to it tonight.

RATING: 8
This is a great game, somewhere between Elder Sign (which is easy to play and learn) and Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness (which are tough to get to the table). Very richly thematic, with just enough chaos to be unpredictable but not demoralizing. The feeling of travelling the globe is palpable, and the Big Bad Guys you're fighting against each give the game a different feel. This may be the best Lovecraftian board game out there, very well balanced, tightly designed, and fun even for people who aren't fans of other Lovecraft-themed games.

It was a good idea gone bad from day one. The game is overpriced, the content of the box of the game is limited, only like 6 scenarios (they could have worked a bit more on that part, like 12 scenarios) and no coop rules too.

I don't recommend this due to the ridiculous price of the game. Don't pay more than 50$ for this thing.

No other game gets me quite as invested as Eldritch Horror. This was the third board game I ever bought, and the first one that showed me just what the medium was capable of. This game takes you on a journey, sometimes dark and  grueling, sometimes silly and absurd. It is stressful and delightful. It can deliver powerful, memorable narratives, and also spin nonsensical yarns. The game is far from flawless and is, at it's core a series of "fetch quests" determined by dice rolls. The game plays you more than you play it, but my goodness is it a fun and wild ride. Whenever I have 4 hours open in my schedule, I am begging my housemates to join me for another adventure. Sadly, that does not happen too often, otherwise, this game would be rated higher for me.

I had Arkham Horror as my top rated game, and I was a bit exceptic about this new revamp, mainly because off the large amount of expansions Arkham Horror already had.
But I was greatly surprised about how Eldritch Horror simplified most aspects of the game, keeping the main idea of the game, and introducing new mechanics but keeping it even easier than Arkham Horror.

It surely deserves to be replaced on my top rating.

Pros: Beautiful game, with beautiful art. Mechanically relatively simple. Choose 2 different actions from a choice of 6.
The cuthulhu mythos is there in full, the immersion is very well done. Even better if you have creepy background music as well.

Cons: A mighty game, think 3+hrs with 2 players, but it does have an epic feel to it. It can be a bit daunting, with so many cards and so many bits. You also need to buy a expansion or two, as the you quickly cycle through the location cards.

This is a great game, but one that should not be played too often. Think, once a month maybe, or once very two month.

Most people seem to talk very highly of this game, but after a couple of plays I don't quite understand why. I've played Elder Sign in the past, liked the idea of the theme, but didn't enjoy how shallow it felt, and from what others have said, thought that this game would be perfect. However it's not that different from Elder Sign at all, and at some points actually less fun.

Every collection needs something Lovecraft. I'm not too fond of the dice throwing, but I like the atmosphere. Works also with some non-gamers because it's a co-op. Rated higher than AH because it's still new to me. (28.3.2016) 

Played this one after a somewhat long hiatus. Rating dropped to 7 from 8. It's a fine co-op. Kinda needs an expansion but then again I'm not sure I want to spend money on them instead of getting new games. (14.11.16)

My evolution as a gamer has made it so I don't really enjoy these thematic co-op games as much as I used to (rating dropped to 6). Reading cards and throwing dice can be fun if the atmosphere is right but it's still too long and fiddly. Also it really needs expansions after you have gone through the cards and I'm not willing to buy them. Sold this one to a friend so I'll still get to play if I want to. (8.2.2017)

Loving the theme in this game, brings me back to my younger self playing the Alone in the Dark videogames for the first time.

RATING: 3
Rating based on this not being my type of game, rather than on poor design, execution, or components.  I really wanted to like this game, as it really captures the Lovecraft vibe with a beautiful game board and components.  But the insanely long set up times due to the sheer number of components, the maddening amount of text on cards, the nameless dread of long playing times that resulted ONLY in repeated loss of the game to a Great Old One, along with reliance on dice rolls for EVERYTHING you do, nearly drove me to voluntary commitment at Arkham Asylum.  Also, I watched new players eyes glaze over in sheer confusion (or boredom) whenever I attempted to explain the rules, as if I were reciting The Necronomicon in a language they did not understand.  More of a chore than a game for me.  Traded.

I'm not enjoying this as much as Arkham though my investment into FFG's Cthulhu lore is heavy so I do find the game fun. Part of my disappointment comes from the fact that we've never beaten the game. I'm taking this as a 'challenge accepted' kind of thing and still buying expansions and keeping up with the game.

RATING: 8
A great improvement over Arkham Horror with tighter rules and length. You can certainly complete this in an evening. Globe-trotting map is fun and cooperative play really works. A series of bad decisions and breaks can overwhelm your chances of success. Let yourself quit if that happens and you'll mainly remember the times you saved the world.

RATING: 6
Would play, but incredibly random and only small chances to mitigate the randomness.  Also theme only comes through because of lots of random encounters which I don't like.  Too much set up
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Immense amount of annoying rules that amount to very few actual choices in game. Choices rendered meaningless by extreme randomness. Less actual depth than most party games. Game full of irritating mechanics like players becoming Delayed - effectively doing nothing and waiting for everyone else to make their move. Long play time compared to effective player actions in the game, so my engagement wanders. This is a train wreck of a game held together by Cthulhu popularity and willingness of some gamers to play games where the gameplay amounts to rolling dice and moving from point A to point B to read plot snippets that don't connect to anything.

It's Arkham horror on a world spanning, epic scale.  The game has been considerably streamlined when compared to its relative; gone are the little rules that add nothing to the game.  The rules are much more easy to grok and remember.  The area where it is slightly lacking however is variety - AH base game was already chock full of different objects and place to discover.  But no doubt that this shortcoming will be fixed by exten$ion$.

RATING: 7.5
Only played one game.  Setup was a little long, and needs to be followed step-by-step.  Game play becomes fairly intuitive after a few turns.

It's lighter than ARKHAM HORROR, but it's about the same length.  A 3 hour game time is most probably possible if the game is already set up and everyone knows how to play.

Components are of great quality, as we have come to expect from FFG.

Typical co-op of these days. Has a Pandemic feel to it, with all the globetrotting & closing of gates/getting rid of infection tokens.
But Eldritch Horror has a much richer theme.. as a matter of fact so rich, that although i was bored last time, i'm considering playing it again.

Sadly it tends to be waaay too long.. you kinda have to read all the flavour text (otherwise the game is nothing but mechanics), and with 4 or 5 Investigators you play 4-5 hours easily.

RATING: 9
In it's own genre, I believe this game to be a masterpiece. Co-op game with Lovecraftian horror theme, the whole world is in danger and together you must defeat the powers of all sorts of evils. In this game every decision counts too (you don't have much time against the game until it beats you to the pulp). Game is hard and challenging, it has a load of expansions so you really can mod your experience indefinitely. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
1 - 8 players (Best with 4 investigators or at least an even number of investigators)

This is sort of a sequel or re-implementation of Arkham Horror that reduces some of the fiddliness.  I like it a lot more than Arkham Horror and would almost always prefer to play this game.

I love Arkham. I love Eldritch. This one is oozing atmosphere and Lovecraftian horror, just like Arkham, but feels sleeker and more streamlined. The story emerging from each game is really engaging and I absolutely love globetrotting around saving the world. It might become somewhat repetetive with the low card count, but that will probably ne fixed with some expansions. Great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed the game, definitely cleaner than Arkham Horror. Only problem is Eldritch only has a few of the Elder ones which can make the games feel repetitive quickly. I understand the expansions can fix this but this review is for the base game.

I am not a huge fan but I cant quite put my finger on why. This often feels like a heavier Pandemic with lots of Cthulu themed fluff text.

RATING: 8
Ok. Color me a believer now.

I love Arkham Horror, and I feared this could not reproduce the atmosphere of AH.

First time out, EH did just that, as my 2 investigators solved the 3rd mystery to block Azathoth's return with the Doom token on 1.

Quite a rush, and a good enough implementation of Lovecraftian theme and material to sell me.

I won't rush to rate this, but it may well surpass AH.

Great game.

Found some color-coded stands from my Raging Champions board game to use as Gate token holders. 
They do an amazing job highlighting the colors of each open gate and assist in keeping an eye out for the dreaded Omen track's movement.

Summer's here once again and I'm making hopeless effort to beat Yig.
Of four games, only one has seen the investigators solve three mysteries and come close to beating the snake-GOO

Now playing with Strange Remnants and the solitaire experience of EH gets better and more thrilling!

Spent this past weekend playing against Abhoth and Nephren-Ka and scored two victories!  Defeat is a big part of EH, but it sure is nice to walk away with a few wins once in a while!


6.14.16
Summer again and it's been a no-brainer affirmation that I truly love this game.
With the latest expansion, Signs of Carcosa,  Eldritch Horror is as much fun and 'agonization' as before. Four, new unique investigators and an Ancient One for which I haven't quite discerned a pulse for difficulty (2 of 3 wins so far)/
Neat Talent conditions, new spells and the Blight!
Love this game.

Az Arkham Horror mondhatni felturbózott változata. Itt már nem csak Arkham vásrosában játszunk, hanem az egész Föld a terep. A nehézség és a játékmechanika nagy része egyezik, de sok helyen egyszerűsödött, és komolyabbnak hat. Nagyon jó, epikus játék, de mint ahogy egy ilyen küldetés során megszokhattuk sok szerencse és csapatmunka szükséges a ritka győzelemhez.

Amazing game! Everything is top notch. Rules are good, components are nice, and the gameplay is innovative and really fun! Eldritch Horror as become one of my all time favorite boardgames.

I normaly play with only 2 players as that makes the game smoother and faster. I also own Arkham Horror but it doesnt stand a chance to this. 

Eldritch somewhat reminds me of Robinson Crusoe but the rules in Robinson Crusoe are much more confusing and annoying. Both games are good buth Eldritch just wins hands down for me.

Now with some expansions this game is even better!

Don't really like the success/fail dice roll system. Even if I add 10 dice to a test, I could still roll 0 successes. Adding to tests should negate fails and improve minimum successes, not keep the test 100% luck-based. The mythos card effects usually decide whether you win or lose as well, which is a bit annoying, since you can rarely do anything to avoid them. Otherwise entertaining and thematically interesting.

[microbadge=3392]

This is my favorite kind of game, a [i]choose-your-own-adventure[/i] book cut up and pasted onto cards.*

[size=7]*For best effect, have the left-hand player draw and read the card for the active player—in dramatic fashion—while keeping the pass/fail results secret.  Only tell them the choices, and then once made and rolled-for, the resulting outcome—don't give away any results they didn't get.  This keeps things [i]mysterious[/i].  (It's best for the left-hand player to do this as the right-hand player may still be doing bookkeeping while finishing up their turn, and it gives everyone a rotating slot as storyteller.[/size]

Now that we've played enough to get the rhythm of the thing I quite like it, especially the feeling of putting your own team together, via allies, and taking on different aspects of the mega-plot while coordinating with other globe-trotting groups.  You can almost see the red arrows gliding from place to place while the adventure-travel music beats a tattoo of ominous progress.

The mechanical stuff's fine, I guess—I don't really notice it, which says a lot—but so far the emergent narratives have been fantastic.  Which is all I really care about.

So, does this replace [gameid=15987]?  Not really.  They're two different beasts.  [i]Arkham[/i] is a mechanically quirky and convoluted thing (facets I find charming) about three-fisted Mythos adventures in New England, while [i]Eldritch[/i] is the cleaner, tighter, "more modern" global version.  They're different enough to be distinct and enjoyed for the unique experiences they provide.

I am a big fan of HPL and really like this game. It's highly thematic, you will almost always have very close & exciting games. Beware, it doesn't play quicker as Arkham Horror, but it's not (yet ;)) a rules mess like AH, so casual gamers can play it instantly, too. The issue of too few encounter cards is mitigated with the expansion. Highly recommend, scales well and you don't need a keeper.

I have pimped this game out a lot- with cloth bags, envelopes, upgraded dice, and organizers. It represents an epic struggle at the global scale. Best with 4 players. I worry sometimes the randomness of the cards can rob you of the thematic pacing and enjoyment. Occasionally there will be nothing to do, or something you should do that is technically impossible- when these things occur, the game feels broken.

My favorite game.  I love the theme, I love the flavor text on all the different cards that really tell a great story.  I love how sometimes you'll play and it will be all about hunting down monsters and closing portals and other times are about going after clues or getting spells.  Each Elder God feels very different and really forces you to change your strategy.  I typically play this one with just my wife, but we play 2 characters each when we do.  Otherwise, it seems too daunting to try and traverse the map when some ongoing rumor pops up clear across the globe with a timed condition on it.  The characters don't feel quite balanced, though.

My desert island pick.
Still my favourite game and I love the theme.  Nothing else I've played feels quite the same.  It's long though so we don't get to play it very often.  Takes forever to set up though.  

Because of the long setup and play time I've downgraded my rating from a 10 to a 9.  

I love it but the last time we played we couldn't get a dice roll in our favour for over an hour.  We lost 4 investigators.  We still had almost an hour in front of us but our defeat was virtually inevitable at that point.  We felt like failures but we simply weren't having any fun.  haven't played it since.  Boo.  

Arkham Horror TCG is scratching a 'somewhat' similar itch in less time these days.

RATING: 8
This definitely replaces Arkham Horror.  Arkham Horror is good, but I have a hard time keeping track of all the little things that make doom track move and how each monster works.  Eldritch Horror is a much more streamlined version.  Like how each mythos deck will be different.  I like that instead of simply picking up a clue token, investigators actually draw a research card and resolve it.  The game is easier to play, but almost has more elements to suck you into the story.  VERY THEMATIC.

I love this redesign of Arkham Horror, Now with more emphasis on a main plot and a really clean mechanical design.

This is essentially Arkham Horror 1.5 - the same game, more or less, but with some streamlining and a change of focus from a city-based setting to a globe hopping one.

The streamlining won't survive the inevitable bloat from wave after wave of expansions (and I prefer the crunch of Arkham in any case) but the major problem with the design ethos is that the global setting offers far less narrative focus and more of an Indiana Jones pulp vibe in my opinion. There's not a lot of Lovecraft left in FFG's Lovecraftian horror at this point.

The game ships with too few cards - you really need the Forsaken Lore expansion if you don't want to see the same cards come up twice in the same game.

Having said all that, this is still a really enjoyable and engaging co-op and it's great for solo gaming too (table space allowing). If the superior Arkham Horror didn't exist, I'd probably really rate this game.

This game just didn't work out for me. People told me, "It plays faster than Arkham Horror and is a simpler better version!"

It doesn't seem to work out any simpler for me. Its rulebook is just as confusing, with some mechanics I really had to hunt to understand. And the margins of chance are much narrower, because fewer dice are rolled, so there's less I could stack in my favor. The dice told me "you don't get to play this game" all three times I've tried to play since acquiring it, by driving my characters insane and killing them without my accomplishing the first thing towards the story/game completion objectives.

I already understand Arkham Horror, and can teach it to such new friends as I haven't already taught. Between a friend and I, I've got all of that game. I don't think I'll be playing this not-actually-better-for-me version again.

Possibly the most complex game I've ever played. I've played three times and I've never even come close to winning. Even when we tweak the rules, at most, we get almost halfway through the game before losing. But it's incredibly satisfying to play. I end each four hour game wanting to play another round. High replayability.

At its core, it's a simple dice rolling game, but there are very many moving parts to keep track of. I'm constantly referencing the rulebook and forums because I always need clarifications on whether or not I can do this or that. It's a whirlwind of a game!

I really don't dig the overarching Cthullhu theme and this might be my main negative about the game.

I fell in love with this game when I first played it. It's a tense struggle, trying to save the world from complete damnition but I fight that fight with pleasure each time. Mechanic wise this game doesn't offer a lot, it's a great game if you like the theme and feel with the game and characters, otherwise I imagine it can be quite dull.

Haven't played in a while. Setup time and game duration are probably the main reasons.  Also, once you've gone through the various scenarios it can get to be a little repetitive.  I guess buying the expansion would be an option.

Lighter, more streamlined version of Arkham Horror. Still narrowly prefer the original because it has a higher degree of immersion, but this one is a lot smoother mechanically. Also, it mildly bothers me that you get less content out of the box for it (only 4 elder gods and 12 investigators, compared to the higher number of equivalent story entities in the original). Still a solid game.

It is a great Adventure, but somehow, the things you can do are very limited. The choice of your character basically tells you how to play the game, and it feels that once you know how to play a character, you are in autoplay mode. That is: You decide at the start who specializes in what, and after that there are not a lot of strategic decisions. Somehow, other popular Coops like Pandemic have more decision making in a shorter playtime. It just doesn't make sense to do things your character has bad attributes in because you are just losing a turn and get punished while doing so. As an example, playing Charlie Kane (the Politican) has two things that are just best: Have Encounters in Tokyo to Kill Monsters and put that Influence to use to buy Assets for everyone. 80 % of the Time, your character can and should be played like that. That doesn't mean it is dumb, because Character Selection is very important, but after that, you have a very narrow corridor.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE variable Player Powers. You take a game like Imperial Assault and your Brain is going to hurt from all the Options you have, even though your character might be bad at some things. 

That beeing said, there is a lot of fun story in it, and I think my first two playthroughs this game was a 9 for me.

The best designed game in its class. Shows Arkham Horror up as the ancient terror that it is, for my money EH is better in every conceivable way. And Flying Frog's versions of the same thing? Fuhgedaboutem!

The action system is simple and straight forward and keeps the game moving. 

The encounter system is great, the best in any game I can think of. The encounters are thematic, and simple to resolve, and the two types, simple and complex, mean even more variety.

The Mythos phase adds just the right amount (usually) of complication and misery, without the excessive arbitrariness you get in games like Fortune and Glory or Touch of Evil.

The use of decks specific to each Ancient One keeps everything feeling relevant and thematic, while the double sided condition, spell and (with expansions) asset cards mean you're never quite sure what's going to happen when a certain card comes into play. Even if you've been poisned before, the effects of this particular poisoning are uncertain, until you flip the card. It's very cool.

I think the word that best describes EH is 'tuned'. Everything feels like it's been thought through and tweaked to be just right. The Mythos deck for example. You construct it differently for each Ancient One, so they can all have slightly different feels. And there are three different types of card, and you combine them in a certain ratio, so the deck will have just the right mix of different types of screwage. AND they have difficulty levels, so you can tweak your game to be easier or harder, or get progressively more difficult, just as you wish.

The expansions integrate very intelligently with the base game, adding more content to the standard encounter decks which is relevant to any game, and a variety of stuff, sideboards, extra decks, that you can choose to use or not. Adding a sideboard is as simple as getting out the decks related to it and adding a couple of tokens to the relevant pools, hardly adds any set up time at all.

It's just great, excellently done, maybe the best designed FFG game there is?

Even so, there are a ridiculous number of decks of cards in the game, especially once you start adding in expansions, and that's not going to be for everybody. 

It is for me though, bring on the madness!

As my first boardgame in over twelve years, Eldritch Horror ignited a long gone spark deep inside of me. And as a horror lover and writer, I could hardly be happier with a cooperative game to play with my girlfriend and friends.
A few cards have upsetting effects (far too upsetting), and the game still is incredibly hard to win. Besides that, even by losing, the atmosphere, flavor and despair evoked by the game make it very enjoying to play.

Not a bad game but one of the best fully thematic and ameritrash games where the game takes you inside of its theme. There is card combos and endless dice rolling of course what you except that kind of game. It could be ok for solo but i dont think to buy it for the experience it delivers because i think it is not worth that much money.

Where in the World is Carmen San Diego meets Pandemic meets Arkham Horror. I love this game so much I just wish I could get it to the table more often.

Update:  Feb 2017. Hasn't hit the table as much as I'd like. I have seen the truth of how random this game can be, and when side quests make you go off and lose your focus from the main mission. Only brings it down one peg because this game is so thematically cool.

RATING: 8
It's a good game that can sometimes be great, and other times bog down. I love the theme, and the board and all of the components. It does a great job at instilling that sort of eerie early 20th century vibe into each game. The use of a "doom" track (a clock that triggers a sort of "new" game if it runs down)is fantastic for creating that desperate feeling of racing against time to defeat these unnatural forces of terror. I also like that the game is TOUGH, and that sometimes there's just not much one can do to affect the outcome of the game at certain junctures. It does a great job at facilitating the feeling that we as players are out of our element fighting against forces that are beyond our comprehension...

However, this is also one of the game's biggest faults.  Because when that system works, it is a fantastically thematic game experience, but when it doesn't work, the game just becomes a literal exercise in futility and can really demoralize a group into defeatist thinking. The game ceases to be thematically engaging at that point, and instead draws too much attention to the underlying mechanics as to make it unenjoyable. This would not be a problem for a shorter game, but games of Eldritch Horror can be up to 4 hours long. 

However, good long games of Eldritch Horror are wonderful and make people want to play again right away even though they know the time commitment required. It's also great that it's a true co-op (without needing someone to play as "the game"). I must say that if I'm going to play a long, dense horror game, I would choose Mansions of Madness over Eldritch Horror every time. But Eldritch Horror definitely has its place, and I enjoy bringing it out from time to time.

I do like this much better than Arkham Horror. Seems to have some of the same problems though, it can easily lasts longer than is actually fun.

I love the story elements and immersive theme of the game.  The scenarios seem to be pretty difficult to beat, but the game mechanics are fairly straight-forward.  I don't frequently play games that are so dependent on the dice roll and luck, although there are game mechanics that allow players to manage luck with careful planning.  I'm looking forward to more plays and working on my strategy.  Fun solo experience as well!

This game ends Arkham Horror for me... a nicely themed groupthink game... solve tasks  under a timer with monsters coming at you to save the world.  Par usual with FFG, many stacks of cards, lots of minis, and an ongoing deluge of expansions, and this is all good (if you like this sorta thing).  It's a coop game, so not for everybody, and it's a horror thematic game (again, not for everybody).  For me, it takes the good bits of AH and renders them down to a better gaming experience.   I enjoyed it, and would be happy to play again.

Prepare for some butthurt. This game is hard to win.

Fewer fiddly bits than [b][thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing][/b], so setup doesn't take nearly as long.

Also, it's more thematic than Arkham Horror, if you can believe it. The conditions on the cards really add to the game. It's a nice touch. For example when you cast a spell, it's no longer just "you lose 1 sanity", it's "you lose 1 sanity [i]and here's why[/i]".

This game truly IS Arkham Horror Second Edition, they simply did not have the balls to call it that. It is an improvement on most aspects of AH, especially because the game is less fiddly and plays more smoothly.

While AH will always have a special place in my heart, this game is so much more playable and less awkward that I am certain I will be playing it much more often, especially with larger groups.

For now, it lacks variety, and am curious to see what the inevitable expansions will bring to the table.

Theme: Lovecraftian/Cosmic Horror
Gameplay: Move/Actions/Encounter Card - Beast of an Ameritrash game that'll fill your whole table with Madness, this is a 'streamlined' ARKHAM HORROR.
Components: Outstanding, although the world map isn't as interesting & intimate as ARKHAM. 
Replayability: Setup/Complexity is a turn off to some and but it's a rewarding thematic game experience.
Rulebook: Pretty good considering the sprawling game, separate rule reference is nice.

First game: Seven-player game (ouch!) against Azathoth. We made precisely 0% progress towards completing the _first_ mystery - talk about a failed attempt to save the world!

Apart from that: Seven players are obviously too many. Will play with 1-4 in the future. The game felt very thematic, but I worry slightly that the thematic aspect was mainly of the "read flavour text aloud" kind.

Anyway, time will tell whether it's a keeper. But fewer players next time, much fewer players...!

The only thing that keeps me from playing this game more often is the length of time to finish.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (June 2015)

I love Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror is very similar, so I also liked it a lot. As with my first AH play, the first EH play was plagued with many rules questions, (I didn’t have the time to read the rules before the game) but it was very fun.

The rules can be explained under 20 minutes and playtime is around 3 hours. The game components and art are great as is usual from FFG.

I can´t help but compare both games:

•	The theme is the same in both games (obviously), but the mechanics in Eldritch Horror are streamlined and easier to grasp, however I’m not sure if EH offers a better game experience. Unless most of the games I play, I do love this theme.

•	The investigator´s skill set will remain static for most of the game, so it makes the game quicker. In Arkham Horror, I really liked to tweak my investigators abilities each turn, furthermore, as they are opposites it was a hard decision. I’m still not sure which way I prefer.

•	The playtime is shorter in Eldertich Horror.

•	The monsters are quite similar, but the combat is very different. We no longer fight to the death in each combat match, also we don’t have the possibility of evade anymore. In my only game, I felt the monsters aren’t that important, they mostly are relevant if you finish your movement on them (they no longer restrict movement) and many times we could ignore them (with some exceptions). I liked more the way Arkham Horror handled them, they were the source of much tension because they moved and many hunted you. The Epic monsters are great, from the art, to the different component shape (so you can easily find them). There are no longer trophies nor terror track. 

•	The movement is similar (Point to Point), but you can only move once each turn and then use your travel tickets. We no longer have a speed stat. I like this because you have to think were in the world you want to go ahead of time. In general, you cannot travel quickly from one place to another. This also makes thematic sense as you are traveling the world and not a city or town.

•	The gates are less convoluted, but I miss the way they were handled in Arkham Horror, now they are as any other encounter in the game and have an unique deck for all of them, so it no longer matters where the gate connects to (a shame). Also, in my only play, a strong physical character had a very low possibility of closing the game because all tests were made with Lore, not strength. This makes perfect thematic sense so I approve. This also makes much more important to have a rounded group of investigators. The gate encounters are a series of tests which can be the equivalent of the encounters of the other worlds in AH, so I also approve of this. Closing gates continues to be relevant, if you don’t the Ancient One will awake quickly.

•	The difficulty of the base game is harder in Eldritch Horror. One of my main complaints about Arkham Horrar was that it was too easy to beat (but the expansions fix this).  

• 	In Eldritch Horror you need to solve mysteries to win and if the Ancient One awakes you have to solve another mystery. This is very thematic and I love the way EH handles it. It has a different deck for each Ancient One. 

•	In Eldrith Horror you have much less clue tokens. This makes the game a lot harder because you cannot re roll as often as before and getting the clue tokens is also much harder. I’m still not sure about this because without Clue Tokens you are at luck´s mercy, but I also like to have a harder game.

•	I love the way Eldritch Horror manages the stores, now it does thematic sense and you can (or try to) buy whatever you want, not at random as Arkham Horror handled it.

•	Now it is an official rule that the active player won’t read his encounters and won’t know the other option if he passes or fail a test. I love this and it makes the game much more enjoyable for me. This is also the way we played Arkham Horror before.

•	Eldritch Horror has a plethora of conditions. I think this is the legacy of Dunwitch Horror and I approve. I love that they have hidden information on them and you only look when a condition is met. This is also how the spells works.

•	In Eldrtich Horror when an investigator is defeated he dies and he is out of the game for good (the player will restart with another investigator, there is no player elimination unless the Ancient One is awake). I love this because it makes perfect sense, also you can search the investigator remains to pick up his equipment :D.
•	The fight with the Ancient One is heavily modified, now if it awakes it makes the game harder for the investigators, but there isn’t an instantaneous fight with it, I also like this change.

•	The Mythos cards now form a limited deck, this a huge plus because it sets a clock for the game to finish and it doesn’t drag. It also adds a source of tension for the instigators (they lose if depleted) and, as each Ancient One makes his own mythos deck, it also serves as a difficulty setting. I really like this change.

•	In general, Eldritch Horror is easier to manage but I found it to be less in many respects. It has less components, less cards (most of the decks were combined, there are no longer ally decks, common item decks etc. They are all combined), less gates. However this doesn´t mean Eldritch Horror is less of a game, in fact I loved it. I think I prefer Arkham Horror simply because I played it first but I’m worried EH has now a low replay value (it only come with 4 Ancient Ones). I’m sure the expansions will fix this but AH came with 8 Ancient Ones right from the start.

Bottom line, I love the game and I will buy all its expansions. At this stage in my gaming career (5 years into the hobby), I’m liking euros more and more, however Eldritch Horror will always have a place in my collection along with Arkham Horror, for me it isn’t a replacement. I want to play it again soon.

At the end of last year, I noticed a change in my gaming tastes. I’m drifting away from Ameritrash games. I still enjoy a lot of them, but my desire to play them is, generally, very low. There are exceptions (like Eldritch Horror) but overall I’m getting bored by them. This new trend has affected most Ameritrash games including this one, so I’m downgrading its rating. Still Eldritch Horror is a game that has a permanent spot in my game collection.

Didn't like it for the first time. It took me some games to get it. The first groups that I tested it, was not that cool. People tend to not focus and didn't pay attention. This game CAN be great, but you will need a good group (or playing by yourself). And people really needs to play it as a storytelling game. Let other people read your cards. Just read the right result from tests, etc.

I knocked this down to a 9, as it can sometimes drag on for hours depending upon the scenario and how well the players work together to solve the mysteries.  This is probably best with a group that plays quickly and has experience with the game.  Introducing a bunch of new players can be very hit-or-miss.

Finally got ahold of one!  Eldritch Horror seems to be slightly more abstract and a hell of a lot less fiddly and complex than Arkham Horror.  Absolutely dripping with theme, love the flavor text on all the cards.  The only thing I don't like about it is the character portrait/pawns, the artwork is great but they're just lame 2D standees. I think I'd like to upgrade the player pawns to the miniatures FFG sells.

I would be lying if I do not admit that when I saw so many cards being seperated out into many different piles, I was going, '...choo choo fiddle train coming right up!' But when I actually set it up and started playing, everything just clicked right in. Even on my very first game, I only had to reference the rule book maybe 3-4 times, and did not feel like I missed any major rules. This game is wonderfully streamlined - action phase, encounter phase then mythos phase. Simple.

Every encounter really drew me right into the game. Granted, they felt a bit disjointed as one encounter to next one really did not connect with each another (they do not have to, but if they did, it would have brought this game to another level) but Ancient One's mystery cards tied everything up into nice experience. I agree with 'Drive Thru' review where he commented about how the game became more thematic with each plays as if the Ancient Ones are trying repeatedly to consume this world and we are time and time again trying to stop that from happening. 

The reckoning mechanisms are very well done in this game. It is like that of Robinson Crusoe where event gives you a something nice, but later one it will come back to haunt you. I mean, you pledge a solemn vow to accept super powerful ancient blade, but you will gain a dark pact condition that you will have to pay a hefty price later? I just loved how thematic this mechanism worked. 

The double sided cards (Spells/Conditions) deserves a mention. The fact that your spells can have a varying degree of effects or side-effects depending on your roll test was remarkable.

Another hit for me was how each Ancient One felt so different! Each one had a different set of mystery and research cards that give whole new experience from one another. The base game comes with only 4 Ancient Ones to fight but since mystery cards and research cards are all randomized along with different mythos deck - each play will offer something totally new to the table.

However, the base game desperately needs more encounter cards; I can already see dozens of expansions coming up on the horizon but I wish that they would have included maybe twice more encounter cards to increase the farther variety. Mere 8 encounters per each section of map just did not seem to make much sense to me - and ruins the experience somewhat if you get to see the same encounter again and again in a single game, or remember each encounters from one game from next since there are so few.

The investigators seem very specialized - now this is not a bad thing for most of the part, but this can lead to I will just do this one thing for entire game problem. I mean, there aren't that much fun to be had in this game when you just sit in a city, just having encounters and send your goods to other people while they get to move around and fight monsters. Or, maybe some people actually like doing that so this will be a toss up.

Overall, fantastic game. I cannot wait to play again, and this one will stay on my table for a long time before I get tired of it.

2014-07-06 - I've only played this game solo, but I quite liked it. Just as I would expect the theme to work in a story, the players will need a lot of skill and a lot of luck to emerge victorious, but the theme comes across well, and there are plenty of choices to make.

Fun point to point movement Ameri-style game. Just not a H.P. Lovecraft fan. The creatures are also designed to not scare children, so they look too funny. Should call it Eldritch Cartoons instead. That name would fit better thematically.

I love this game. I played it nonstop for three weeks after I bought it. I finally put it away, because I didn't want to get burned out on it. It's pure Amerithrash, and the randomness may be off putting to some, but I feel it fits the theme. My only complaints are: needs more exploration/encounter cards (which is solved by the purchase of the expansion), not enough dice (it comes with 5 - I purchased a nice set of 12 Chessex green translucent D6 to pimp it out a bit). I'd like to see FF put out some investigator minis, like they did with Arkham Horror.

Very chaotic and ameritrashy, but also very fun. At its best with 2 or 3 players, more players just ad downtime and not much more. Better narative storytelling than AH, plays smooth and easy once you get it down.

RATING: 6.5
I like, but don't love a Cthulhu theme. I like the vintage, almost steampunk aspects, but find the placement of fantasy demons somewhat wrong. 

I also love co-operative games. Working as a team to beat the game is good fun, and removes the tension of a winner vs loser scenario (in which the loser is oft angry at their play failures (or angry at the game balance/luck), while the victor is either fist pumping or in an awkward 'British' state of trying to make the loser feel better, but making them feel worse with every sentence). Eldritch nicely side-steps these issues.

I'm not a big fan of this game. To me there is something wrong with it. There are too many artificial elements - clues, sub-adventures etc that don't fit with the main plotline. Far too much luck in dice rolling. 

I enjoy the initial choice of characters, I love the mix of brute force and clever (and how clever character like Charlie Kane, Jacqueline Fine etc. seem to better the out and out warriors). I also like the character development - new weapons, injuries and debts. This is one of the games joys, allowing players to really get into character.

Players have some choices, but mostly over where to go, or how best to spend a sub-efficient second action when there is nothing to really use it on (e.g. what to do when in a wilderness you need stay in for your encounter phase). Beyond movement choices are limited, luck takes over. The game leads the players, the players are led by the game. This does not lead to fun game play. Once the storyline with it's seemingly endless mini-events starts to bore and the game starts to drag, many people begin looking for ways to end the game.

Adding players seems to significantly add to the game length. With 5+ players this game can eat hours upon hours. And while the first hour is normally filled with laughs and smiles, the subsequent ones seem to become increasingly subdued as players stop bothering with flavor text and skip to the test icons. 

26/10/2014 - downgrading from initial score of 7 (last night this game bored people for 4 hours, after which we had completed less than 1/4 of the game. Switching to Galaxy Trucker the effect was obvious, smiles, laughs and fun were restored to the whole group.)

More skillcheckalicious Lovecraftian horror from FFG. This is VERY similar to Arkham Horror, but streamlined. Which should you get? If you liked the idea of Arkham Horror but thought that it was too much work for what you got, you should try this. If what you love about AH is all of the variety and exploration, then EH might feel a bit skimpy to you and there is no need to switch. If you haven't gotten either, may as well start here. It is newer and will be support longer, most likely.

Personally, I'm in the first category and haven't played Arkham Horror in a long time as a result.

If you like drawing cards and taking skill checks then great! That's really just about all there is to these games...

I enjoy this much more than Arkham, where I sometimes felt like I was floundering wondering what to do...though this isn't always much shorter...5 hour game last time. However, I always feel like I have things to do...impossible things, yes, but very rarely just feel like I should spend time just beefing up. 

If you play for the flavor text (like we do), this base game gets pretty repetitive quickly, but the Forgotten Lore expansion really gives it quite a bit more life.

This is a marvellous melding of theme with contemporary co-op Euro game. If future plays are equally enjoyable I wouldn't be surprised if I increase my rating to 9.

I played 3 games of this back-to-back-to-back. They were all two player games against a different Ancient One each time. Needless to say I was very impressed with the game, we don't often play the same game twice in a row, let alone three times. 

The rules are very straight forward and the underlying mechanics are well implemented. Our games were surprisingly fast the longest was 1 hour and 40 minutes which saw us draw out the entire Mythos deck. Our fastest game was a little over an hour.

The only thing I'm hesitant about is the variety in the Ancient Ones. They have only 4 mystery cards, 3 of which you see each game. The other decks all have plenty of cards. I have yet to play the same Ancient One twice so perhaps this concern isn't warranted.

Easily my favorite of the Arkham Files games. Keeps all the flavor and impact of Arkham Horror with a SLIGHTLY speedier pace and a more epic feel. A game built on theme, so you have to be willing to go where the game takes you but if you like that (and I do) it's fantastic. Overall amazing but it's worth noting that even running shorter than Arkham, it can sometimes overstay its welcome. Especially with any of the large-box expansion boards.

Rules and game structure are streamlined compared to Arkham Horror. Completing the mystery card tasks has a Lord of the Rings LCG vibe and gives the game more focus. It’s still a long game but this is probably necessary to evoke the intended atmosphere. At times, I got a little bit bored by the repetitious mechanisms and long times of not accomplishing anything. To be fair, this might be credited to an unlucky streak of getting cursed, failing the next encounter with the consequence of having to pause the next round and getting jailed in the consecutive round. In a five-player game, a lot was happening in the meantime with me being merely a spectator. OTOH, some might see this as a unique gaming experience.

Still, as a cooperative game with lots of theme it’s enjoyable occasionally with the right casual group of players. I have to play Arkham Horror again to make a judgement if I like any of the two games better or if Eldritch can replace Arkham.

Just yesterday we spent a great evening playing this game. Yig awoke in the end and we could do nothing but see it take over the world. No problem, the seed has been planted now and I will get me one copy as soon as I can. 
One thing to consider, however obvious, is you need to consider a lot of time to play for longer groups of players. Rounds get longer too, and it is only too easy to forget the main goals set for the specific games. Don't, they are the key to victory, more than closing portals or killing evil cultists and creatures.
Can't wait to play again.

Too early to tell yet from one play, so "7." I'm impressed by the way in which this, in effect, redesign of Arkham Horror managed either to reduce rules complexity or, more impressively, move the complexity to the cards and tokens rather than the rules themselves. The "flavor" is actually pretty good, and the globetrotting approach consistent if not with HPL then with the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game (e.g., Masks of Nyrlathotep) that is the board game's true progenitor. I think FFG may, though, have maxed out on card and component variety, and the sheer amount of "stuff" makes this game still an every-once-in-a-while affair, with Elder Sign still serving as the default short(er)-game standard in this milieu.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Strictly from game mechanic perspective, it is definitely a great improvement to Arkham Horror. Cleared out a lot of clunky rules and reduce the amount of upkeep work you need per round. 

Unfortunately, I still dislike how little "Game" its provide. As your actions are very limited and the game priorities are quite strictly constrained (If you don't do this within X turns, you will lose), most of the time the player doesn't really make much decision. 

Also, I found that there are quite a bit of snowball effect, Good or Bad roll in the first 3-4 turn can often dictate how easy or hard the game is.

This game has been touted as Arkham light. I suppose that it is better in the sense that the rules are streamlined and it is easier to learn. But my main problem is that you take 2 Actions (which take about 20 seconds or less) then you have to sit back and wait 5 to 10 minutes for the cards to be read and the encounters to unfold.

I feel like players have very little impact on the game. 2 actions, and then you are a spectator for most of the game. Rinse and repeat.

I won't compare this to Arkham Horror because these are two different games in my opinion. It has some similarities but overall is different.

Our first game took about 2 1/2 hours which isn't bad.

I only play it solo. There is reliance on card draws and dice, which makes it swingy... and means I shouldn't care for it. However, I enjoy it more than expected because it tells a story and is very thematic.

This game captures the flavor of Arkham without a lot of the fiddly mechanisms, however there is something of the theme and atmosphere lost in the transition to a worldwide scale. I think I like Arkham Horror a little better, if only because of theme, but that being said, the mystery solving element is excellent. Overall I am sure this will hit the table more due to the streamlining and reduced playtime.

Builds off and borrows from the other games in the Arkham Horror, Elder Sign universe and the result is terrific.  Clean, elegant mechanics, tough obstacles, meaningful decisions, very unique character abilities, and of course powerful evil monsters trying to end the world.  Great game.

RATING: 9
Great narrative amidst a wealth of strategic choices, with cleaner and faster gameplay than Arkham Horror.  I like the globe trekking element, as investigators hear stories of weird happenings in far off places and need to plan ahead turns in advance to go address them.  Time is a precious commodity, as you decide whether to solve the current mystery, address an incipient threat, or accept delays to recover or learn something.

I have the expansions forbidden lore, strange remnants, and masks of nyarlathotep.

After teetering on the fence for a couple of months on whether or not to get this, I decided to go ahead and give it a chance.  Now, I have never played Arkham Horror due mainly to the fact that by now, it has so many expansions that it would cost hundreds of dollars to surmise the entire collection and I have a distinct need to collect everything relating to a theme that I am interested in.  When I read that Eldritch Horror was a brand new standalone board game that was a streamlined, more intuitive game than its predecessor, I decided that it might be a great alternative.  

I am absolutely thrilled that I gave it a chance!  This game is a complete and total blast to play.  I have only played three games up to now, but each one has been a distinctively unique adventure that spans the world and takes me into crazy encounters with Lovecraft's lore.  I think my favorite aspect of this game is the Choose Your Own Adventure vibes it gives off, letting players decided exactly where they want to go and what they want to do.  For example, I was playing with Leo Anderson the Expedition Leader and found myself exploring the Heart of Africa and deep jungles of the Amazon most of the game while on the other side was Trish Scarborough the Spy, who loaded up on weapons and allies to fight terrifying monsters.  Eventually, these two adventurers met up in Buenos Aires and Leo handed over all the immensely powerful artifacts he discovered to Trish, making her an unstoppable agent against the supernatural darkness.

Overall, this game is really intriguing, diverse, and immensely entertaining.  It's the best solo game I've ever played and it's great with other people too (if you you don't mind explaining the rules and synopsis.)  I will definitely be a dedicated fan to the future content and expansions that Fantasy Flight produces, and I look forward to my future adventures in Eldritch Horror.

2015-09-13 - 8 - This is the best adventure game I played so far. I really like random encounters and surprises which is something I missed in Descent. The theme is really there and even if you treat it with some humor the game can provide you some immersive stories (and some absurd, but that is not a big deal). 
I am looking forward to play with expansions after some plays with basic game, which can increase my rating I think.

As a newcomer to coop board games this one proved to be a bit of a challenge at first. The first few times I played I was constantly checking the rules (and the handy quick guide included with the game), but after playing a few times with my BF we really got the hang of it and were able to fully utilize the many components of the game. EH can get fairly complicated so having a grasp on the basic flow of the game will help when conditions, artifacts, spells, etc. add further complexity. I will say that this game takes some time to get used to and you really have to get the right group together to play. Be prepared to lose and maybe even sacrifice your character for the sake of winning. My best advice for EH: be adventurous and flexible. This game doesn't always have large rewards for big risks, but it is worth taking a hit or two to finally win your first game. Regardless of winning or losing, my favorite thing about EH is the story. Each of the 8 characters has a unique set of powers that complement their back story, and nearly every card in the game has some sort of flavor text that builds up the suspense. This is a fun game to lose yourself in and I definitely recommend giving it a try.   

Things to thing about when consider when playing/purchasing this game:

Read the rule book completely as you set up the game for the first time. I know that this is hard to do, but trust me it will provide you with a much better experience. 

Know that this game is trying to kill you. If you play like your life depends on it you will have a lot of fun. You might die trying, but hey, that's why you get to start over with a new character. 

Be flexible. You may have to start as a new character mid game. You may have to face an unknown threat. You may become cursed or hurt. In any case, flexible strategy in a must for EH with each game proving to be a unique horror of its own.

Buen juego de aventuras ambientado en HP Lovercraft.

Poca estrategia vas a encontrar, algunas decisiones más o menos lógicas se deben tomar durante la partida, decisiones que de no tomarlas correctamente pueden relegarte a una derrota, pero aunque tomes las decisiones correctas, el azar sigue presente.

El mecanismo de eventos y encuentros esta bastante bien pensado, todo muy personalizado. Ayudando en gran medida a lograr una ambientación y una sensación muy buena.

The story, the artwork, the complexity - I swear to Yog, this is an amazing game. Intricate co-op with lots to do. As the Doom count goes down, I feel the stress building and nagging away at me.

Gra kooperacyjna w klimatach powieści H.P. Lovecrafta. Możemy zmierzyć się z Cthulhu, Yog-Sothothem i innymi przedwiecznymi, wcielając się w badaczy wyposażonych w komplet unikalnych cech i zdolności. Gra wykonana jest perfekcyjnie, ilustracje są świetne, czytelność kart i grafik powalająca, a sama rozgrywka zaskakująco nieliniowa i różnorodna. Gra jest długa, w zależności od liczby graczy od 2 do nawet 6 godzin, dość złożona, ale nowi gracze, dadzą bez problemu radę grać, jeśli przy stole siedzi przynajmniej jedna osoba dobrze znająca zasady. Eldritch jest w pełni kooperacyjny, nie ma negatywnej interakcji, ale nie oznacza to, że jest łatwy. Mimo wielokrotnych rozgrywek wciąż mamy z ekipą dzielnych badaczy problemy z niektórymi przedwiecznymi. Jako bezwzględny minus należy się przyczepić, do konieczności kupienia dodatku (Zaginiona wiedza) jeśli gra się spodoba i będziecie chcieli w nią grać częściej. Chodzi o mały zasób kart spotkań. Na szczęście dodatek jest w rozsądnej cenie, i jego nabycie zapewnia już kompletność gry i na prawdę dużą regrywalność. Gorąco polecam!

Fantastic game if you're looking for something with a bit of complexity but a very quick learning curve leading to more efficient play on each run, while still being challenging. 

Only negatives would be one particular mythos card that resets all your progress (we tore the card up and threw it out) and setup time. The game is easy to store with a half dozen ziploc bags and the number of expansions makes variety of cards incredible, massive replay ability.

One of my first games and I played it from solo to 6 players. Quite nicely produced cooperative game with a lots of lore inside. There is some learning curve, but not too steep. It helps for new players, that it is sufficient that only one player know deeply the rules and manages the game turns. You definitely need first small expansion, it should be included in core box already. The biggest downfall with this game are its expansions. If you buy more of them, you will find out that you have too much of things you really do not need (items, spells etc).

11-18-2013 - Got in a demo and REALLY liked it.  Arkham definitely still has it's place, but in many ways I see this gem replacing Arkham.  Not firing it exactly, but putting it on extended leave perhaps.  Streamlined, quick(er), interesting interactions between players (more so than AH IMHO (even taking Relationship cards into account), and different things are more important than others at times (it didn't feel like it was always about Clues necessarily, though they're still very important of course).  Great fun.  Can't wait to get my own copy!

07-30-2014 - Talked to Launius about EH vs. AH at Dice Tower and he said he still likes AH better.  After a couple more plays, I think I see what he means.  It's true that EH solves stagnation problems.  It's true that EH is shorter and easier to keep track of.  It might even be more thematic with all the special cards for each GOO.  And I do like the interaction between players and the stressful die rolls that come up with Condition cards and such.  But, in the end, after another play, it's just not the same epic experience that AH is.  And I don't want to weigh EH against AH, they really are different games, but all the same I just feel that as great as EH is, it's not fantastically amazing.  At the risk of becoming cursed, EH goes down to a 9.

RATING: 6
Summary: This is a game you really can't appreciate a in single play or without some modification unless you are in a campaign with very experienced players. 

Once you're not looking up every rule on every roll and have tweaked a few things to your liking, it becomes a highly repeatable choose-your-own adventure story with a cast of engaging, sympathetic characters. However, the flavor text that drives the game quickly grows stale, so your love of the setting and mechanics are key.

***

Initial Play Comment: 

The set-up is more daunting than anything. Having divided the tokens and cards based on the set-up map in the manual made it pretty easy to put things on the table. The hardest parts were figuring out what each card was and what location they were bound for. Play was slow in the first three rounds and then more brisk. It felt like my Action phase wasn't good for very much. 

Also, the constant dice-rolling is annoying. It adds too much random number generation to an otherwise story-based game. At minimum I'd prefer some less-random version or at least a die with symbols instead of numbers. At maximum, I'd like some character-based store of roll-values for checks that I can expand and recycle, which adds a strategy element to what to use and when. Maybe this is the D&D player in me, but I also felt there should sometimes be a bonus pass condition for rolling multiple 6s.

***

Plays 2-3 Comments (w/Forsaken Lore and Mountains of Madness w/no sideboard)

Once you understand the turn order, the game runs like clockwork. If you get stuck anywhere, the glossary unsticks you. Actions are brisk, so you don't mind spending some time lingering on the stories told by the cards. I added a set of 1-3-2 style D6 icon die to remove the constant number rolling, and it immediately made me focus more on passing things than getting sixes. 

Despite the ease of game play, two things are just killing my enjoyment. One is trivial - the card management aspect. For both Items and Spells to both be random draw AND a place to go fishing for specific pieces is hugely annoying. The other issue is more serious.

After losing a pair of games I found I didn't mind the loss, but I did mind the lack of agency we had as players. Ancient One mysteries required spells, but neither of us had a means to get them. We pulled several ongoing Events in a row that restricted our rolls and rests and had no way to pick up spells.

After a while, all those brilliant mechanics don't count for much.

***

Plays 4+ Comments (all expansions, but selectively withholding the sideboard or other special mechanics):

It's amazing what some organization and atmosphere does for the enjoyment of this game. 

Organization - A Plano 23600-01 box fits all the tokens and dice (I left out investigators, a tight fit). Cards should be divided based on use - keep the Ancient Ones divided for easy access (I went for 2-each in ziplocks, but ideally they'd each be stored on their own), and Conditions can also be kept segmented since you hardly ever pull a random condition (when you do, just roll to establish which condition type you get). I then organized items between the EH and MoM boxes by things I'll need all game every game (Items, Artifacts) and things I dispose of after set-up (other Investigators and Ancient Ones, AO cards, mythos cards).

This makes set-up a breeze - pick your Ancient One and Investigator, build the mythos deck, and resolve starting conditions. The table is quickly cleared. Go! It takes us less than 15m even with investigator haggling - without, it would be 5m or less.

Atmosphere is a bit harder, but the more we mind it the more fun the play experience. Chiefly, we each bought "Fudge Dice," which are effectively D3s marked with symbols instead of numbers. They're suitable for most rolls in the game aside from the spare number check. Without a focus on numbers, it felt less like a spreadsheet in action and more like a story.

We also stopped reading "Pass" and "Fail" and just continue the story. The "Check Skill" icons became "rely on your X" or "use your Y" instead of telling people to check. We play some instrumental music, either period to Lovecraft or a movie soundtrack. And, finally, we're encouraged to just make stuff up if we hit an Encounter, Mythos, or Gate flavor text we've recently read.

That last point is a big one - this game is sorely lacking in variety in a few key cards you will be using the most. Mythos cards, especially, get cycled through at a clip of 12-16 per game, and you'll quickly have them memorized despite the random mix. Similarly, standard City encounters happen enough that none will be surprising after a few plays. The place where variety excels is with the options for each Ancient One (unique clues and mysteries for each) and the flipped text of Conditions and Spells (meaning no two cards are truly alike, always leaving you with a surprise in play).

From there, you have a potentially smooth game-play experience, but the final aspect is it's just not a fun game with fewer than 3 investigators. Their abilities to interact and save each other's butts make the game fascinating, and just a pair of them isn't enough to do the trick. That means in a two player game you should draft a third investigator and have the Lead chose his/her actions each round - or, simply play with two investigators each.

The difference is the game going from the 4-5 range to the 7-9 range. It's still hard and random and sometimes disappointing, but now it feels like something better than reading a book or watching a movie. If anything, I wish the board was bigger and with more things on it - which means we're suddenly actually interested in Antarctica! 

PS: We house-ruled both Cursed and Blessed conditions to go away faster, as we don't particularly enjoy playing with either.

Streamlined and improved version of Arkham Horror. Well crafted theme, modular design makes multiple play-throughs unique and opens the game up to multiple strategies. Quality components and a beautiful art design.  It is cumbersome to teach to a newcomer, and takes a few plays to get all the rules down.

Overall an excellent game, heavy on theme without sacrificing game mechanics.

Definitely a step up from Arkham Horror, but still far from what I'd call "great."

There's less of the feeling that "the game is playing you," but it's still there from time to time.

The biggest flaw, however, is the amount of content. A disappointingly small number of enemies/scenarios to choose from has a HUGE negative impact on the replay value. Also, we always seem to go through the entire deck of common items, which makes me feel like that deck is probably too thin.

I don't mind playing it if one of my friends is really in the mood for it, but I'm never in that mood myself.

I've played this game twice and love the experience. It is a little long 2.5 to 3 hrs, but worth every minute. The game isn't very complicated and with GM who knows what they are doing, a new person could come along for the journey no problem. Think of Eldritch Horror as an interactive cinematic experience with a slight twist... You may not make it out alive!

RATING: 6
Truly Arkham Horror Light taken to a world stage with significantly different methods to stop each AO. A refreshing change-of-pace to your standard Arkham game.

Would have been better if not for these oversights:

*Cards are more flimsy than standard FFG fare. One of my cards is creased already.
*Double-sided cards are often drawn by name, and it's unclear which side is supposed to be the "front." Handling these decks is tedious.
*1p games are not as one-sided as in Arkham Horror, but they still leave a lot to be desired and are disproportionately hard.
*Lack variety in encounter decks
*(SPOILER) defeated investigator encounters differ only in flavor text and the stat you have to test, and not in outcome
*Resetting a solved Mystery is not a substitute for difficulty and is NOT A FUN MECHANIC, PERIOD.

This game desperately needs expansions, but some of the above points simply can't be fixed this way.

Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One – that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.

Better than Arkham Horror. More balanced depending on number of players, shorter, faster and more purposeful. Decisions such as where to go or when to buy feel less random. Combat's much better. Flippíng cards for triggered events is very cool. Mysteries give you clear objectives and flavor for each Old One. Some of the simplifications I don't particularly love (I feel there's less content overall, and I liked trophies, money and monster movement), but this is nitpicking. It's a great, atmospheric storytelling coop game. After dozens and dozens of games, it's our most played game and one of our favorites.

Look interesting. Seem to stream line arkham Horror. Defenitely want to try it. But I am somewhat frustrated about it because if I really happen to like the game, would I really want to have both arkham and eldritch horror?

I don't mind having elder sign and arkham because they are actually 2 different game that does not replace each other. But eldritch could replace arkham.

A nice re-implementation of Arkham Horror type of game but lighter and more streamlined.  I think I like this a little bit better but AH might be a deeper/richer game for Cthulthu lovers.  This is easier to get to the table.  I think it plays briskly with 3 players at a nice pace, or with 4 players who are experienced.

RATING: 6
This is definitely a streamlined Arkham Horror.  I'm uncertain how I feel about the significant number of cards that have the potential to either kill your character or drive him/her insane causing you to start with a new character your next turn.  Be very wary of the status cards as a significant number of them can kill you.  Dark Powers should likely only be taken as a last resort or when things look a bit desperate.

Eldritch Horror is nothing more than an eloborate dice game. Sometimes it tells a nice story. More often it is a frustrating, overlong ordeal that doesn't offer a serious gamer any meaty decisions. It is very thematic and if you like storytelling games, this might just be your thing. I however traded it away after playing three games.

True confession: I never played Arkham Horror until last year, and I also haven't played it since. I like AH well enough, but it didn't super grab me. Eldritch Horror, on the other hand, I got into right away. It's a lot more streamlined and less fussy, and has more of a sense of exploration. It's also hard as hell, or we were just spectacularly inept. We lost the game, which is why Azathoth descended upon the world around 3pm on Saturday. In addition, I killed off two of my characters. Note that you only play one at a time. I killed my character, then killed her replacement. So if you need someone for your unspeakable horror task force, well, I can work the coffee pot, I guess?

An epic game that immerses you quite well into a world falling apart from Otherworld Gates. While luck does play too much of a factor, this game is extremely thematic with tons of different ailments that can inflict you, while doing so in a way without being convoluted. Also, I love that going to different locations will cause different encounter cards to have different effects. Besides the luck and a few extremely evil cards the only problem I have with this game is that I kind of wish that that the Encounter and player phases were not separate, as since you only have 2 actions on your turn, each player turn doesn't have the feel of you doing something hugely significant (in fact most of the time the important stuff you will be doing is during the Encounter).

EDIT: I've lowered my rating because this game is just too long for how little there is in terms of meaningful choices.

I really wanted to like this game, but half of your turns you are either delayed or better off not taking any actions so that you can have an encounter on the same space you failed your previous one.

This is an attempt to streamline Arkham Horror. There are some thing they got right: mystery cards, monster movement, easier setup, and custom decks.
However, in the process they lost a lot of the control that Arkham Horror offered: skill sliders, abundant clue tokens, etc.
In the end, it became an experience more on rails with fewer decisions and interesting choices, but taking just as long. I don't see a reason to ever play it instead of Arkham Horror.

I grew up a big Lovecraft fan, but I've always always avoided Lovecraftian themed games for the same reason I've avoided movies that deal with the Cthulhu Mythos - you always hear mixed reviews and there is a fear of disappointment.

I never played Arkham Horror but I know of the reputation it has as being a love-it-or-hate-it type co-op.  After one play I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite co-ops.  The best part of the game is the story that it tells.  It's rich in that department and I absolutely love it for that.  The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward.  It seems like a lot to take in at first but it all works and the game plays smoothly.  Luck plays a huge part in the game but can be mitigated in quite a few ways.  A great game that I look forward to playing again.

Plays much better than Arkham due to the much more coherent rules, yet very much the same game at the core. I purchased this because even though I found Arkham Horror very fiddly, I sometimes missed this more 'passive' gaming experience of just throwing dice and drawing cards, watching a story (-ish collection of random events) unfold. This does the job, but I think I preferred the Arkham setting, which probably has something to do with the more claustrophobic feeling the idea of being in this small town conveys.

Kind of disappointed as I really like Lovecraftian games, however this game is not as fun as I thought it would be. The game is very difficult, if the cards are stacked against you, you'll lose and there's nothing you can do about it. The system of getting a success on a five or six and normally rolling only two or three dice is really frustrating as it's mainly luck based. Very slow to move about the massive board as well, so if something goes down in London and you're in Antartica, then good luck getting there before it gets out of control.

Essentially, this is a streamlined Arkham Horror that swaps the Arkham setting for a global adventure. I like it. While I've always enjoyed Arkham Horror, the clunkiness of the game with all the things to remember makes it a bit of a headache to play, and I often end up feeling I didn't really win because I forgot some important rule once or twice. Eldritch Horror fixes these problems. While these fixes might have come at the cost of a bit less variation in the gameplay, it avoids this by adding decks of missions and events that are specific to each GOO, which adds a lot more flavour to the game.

This game will undoubtedly be treated to a plethora of expansions, which the compulsive buyer in me will want, but I'm pleased to say that it looks as though there's room for them without making the game the incomprehensible mess that Arkham Horror with expansions is.

Components are what you'd expect from FFG. No plastic minis (I'm sure they'll sell some down the road though), but lots of cardboard. I did have some tokens split in two, which is annoying, but I think FFG has long since decided that cheap Chinese production and a willingness to readily replace parts is cheaper than producing top quality components in the first place.

Now I know that I'm not into ameritrashes and DEFINITELY not into cooperatives, so I've played it like 2 times so far.

Eldritch is a better game than Arkham for a few reasons. First, the map isn't as busy, the art for characters isn't the same as all other games, the end game is different as well, it isn't just about sealing gates, so it feels less repetitive than Arkham. It has the same feel though.

I'm still undecided whether I prefer this or Arkham Horror.  They are actually rather different games, particularly due to movement speed (being on a world map rather than in Arkham).  I think it really needs the first expansion, Forsaken Lore, to really be a complete game though.

Theres alot too this game when it comes to components - about 10 different decks, monster tokens and counters etc making setup and pack away a bind - Not much too the actual gameplay in my opinion and winning the game comes down to luck on dice rolls and luck drawing the right cards - But that said it is very thematic and enoyable to play - vast amount of characters to play as and a vast amount of equipment making for great variety - some great mechanics in this game with the condition deck and i like how the aquistion of items is done - Will need to play a few more games to see if ill invest in any expansions. a 7 for now

Decent game. Down time is manageable, as player turns are pretty short. It comes with lots of characters for varied play styles. It ran long even for a first play. This seemed odd to me as I had read that the game length wasn't excessive.

Initial rating. This game definitely scratches the Arkham Horror itch without the frustration of so many boxes and rule sets. Unfortunately, after the monster that AH became, few of us want to play it that badly. EH is easier, more accessible, and presently fits in one box. We have the first expansion, but it will probably be our last.

RATING: 10
Meiner Meinung nach abgesehen von der Atmosphäre (da gefällt mir das Setting in der Enge der Stadt Arkham etwas besser) in praktisch allen Belangen Arkham Horror überlegen. Die Spielmechaniken sind deutlich eleganter, man hat das Gefühl mehr Sinnvolles in seinem Zug tun zu können und auch die Begegnungen etwas besser einschätzen zu können, die Regeln wurden von unnötigem Balast befreit, die "Rache"-Mechanik ist genial, Aufgrund des nach gewissen Regeln vorbereiteten Mythosdecks nicht so starke Zufall den Schwierigkeitsgrad betreffend,... Das einzige was noch etwas stört, ist die zu geringe Anzahl an Hinweis-Begegnungskarten, so dass diese sich bei unglücklicher Verteilung (Stadt, Wildnis, See) teilweise in einer einzigen Partie wiederholt haben, was dann doch nicht sein sollte. Da schafft aber wohl die Erweiterung Abhilfe, die ja bald auch auf Deutsch erscheint und für alle Großen Alten die Anzahl der Hinweiskarten verdreifacht.

It is dripping with theme.  EVERY card has flavor text.  I thought some of the decks were too small, but that is not the case.  You only use about 5 to 8 cards in each deck, and if you do run out I'm sure new cards are added in the expansion.  Plenty or variety and re playability.  The instruction booklet and reference guide are divided wonderfully.  More games need to do this!

The coop to pull out when you want a game that is actively trying to beat you down for 3 hours and you have to do your best to stay ahead of it.  This will never be my most played game since you need to be in the right mood for this one, but will get several plays per year.

Positives:
+Great narrative with an adventure feel to it.
+Plenty of ways to mitigate the luck (leveling up skills, buying assets, acquiring artifacts)

RATING: 8
An expansive, rambling adventure that is an absolute blast to play.  Every game is different and every encounter is exciting.  The mythos dice will confound you, yet you'll always be ready for the next encounter.  The encounter cards (all 7 different types!) are location and situation dependent, offering a small sense of control amongst the chaos.

The game features perhaps the best starting cast of any adventure game, with 12 unique characters to chose from in the base game alone.  They match wits with the Ancient Ones, who wait patiently for their chance to awaken and consume the world. Besides the Ancient Ones, investigators will face a seemingly endless horde of otherworldly monsters emanating from gates that spawn around the world.  Players must race around the world fighting monsters, solving clues and closing gates in an effort to solve the mystery and halt the arrival of the Ancient One.

This game is an absolute must for fans of adventure games and/or H.P. Lovecraft's works.  Always a great time, always willing to play!

Have the base game an a number of the expansions, expansions are great because they add more cards to all of the decks which is the only issue that I have with the base game, after a few play troughs you start to see a lot of cards that you recognize.

Played once only. This is an interesting meeting between Arkham Horror and a more "choose your adventure" type of game, like "Tales of the Arbian nights".

The setup is long, but once the game starts, it wows me !

Often you will like to resume in one location (as the dice are not on your side) and lacking options (beside focus now) in the action phase.

First impression: 7

I think that EH is more and adventure experience than an strategy board game. Is like reading a "choose your own adventure" book. In my opinion, in a game of such characteristics the theme plays a big role determining if you like the game or not. In my particular case I'm a light reader of lovecraft and so far I've enjoyed the two games I've payed.

About the general game aspect, I have to say it is gorgeous. The only sidenote maybe is that it has a lot of components and so, it is not easy to find the proper space to play it (at least in my case).

Finally I would say that the game is not a game that you would be playing at every game session, but is a nice experience to have from time to time.

---------------------------------------------------------

Update: 7.5

After my third play I realised that I really like this game, but I've to admit that it is very hard for it to hit the table, and thinking about it, I don't think the game can take much more plays without losing it's shine (unless you buy a lot of expanssions that's it). So given the fact that my budget is low, I decided to trade the game. I hope that it would find a good home...

Great solo.  Not so good with three or more players.  At that player count, it becomes too fiddly and the downtime is a real issue.  I have not tried playing with two, but I think it would work better.  As a solo game though, there is no downtime.  In my experience, it's also and less fiddly because you don't have to contend with differing interpretations of the rules--and the rules leave room for interpretation.  I could see having fun with multiple players who knew the game well and agreed on all the vague points in the rule book.

Cool theme but gameplay devolves a bit gameplay is just rolling dice to hit 5s and 6s mostly. Like most coops doesn't escape the 'problem' of a dominant player telling the rest what to do. Being good in this game is also too much a matter of knowing the decks, which I find a tedious skill.

Well it is different from "arhkam horror" so it's difficoult to compare, but to me this one is a lot of better in many ways. It is far way faster (a play can last two hours). I played it from 1 to 5 players and it can be played really well (arkham horror run better with 4-5 players). It's intrigung, it's more simple thank arkham horror and whitout some flaws of the "arkham". Ok I'm comparing it a little too much, but it's a game you can enjoy if you like esploration, and difficoult scenarios. Only 2 fault: Randomness it's still a bit too high to me. and is short of cards in the base game (the expansion forsaken lore is a must have - cause improve the basic game with a loot of event cards for the 4 great ancient).

Solo: Despite the fussy setup, needlessly large board, and some fiddly bits during play, this is a fun game. A lot of fun, actually. I finished my first game and immediately wanted to play again.

In my first play, my poor investigator never seemed to have a chance -- there's a lot to do, on a big map, with just one investigator. Playing with two (one of many options presented in the rules; I love that) would help, but would increase the fiddliness factor. Solo games need to be hard to be fun, so hard is good.

It tells a fun story, feels a lot like playing Call of Cthulhu in some ways, and takes less time than solo Arkham Horror (90 minutes for this play). I like the variety of character abilities a lot, and I love the variety in the encounters. It seems like the Ancient Ones, since there are only four and they have relatively small mystery decks, might get same-y after a few games, but perhaps not; this element does seem overly "expansion ready."

It's also a beautiful game. The graphic design is gorgeous and fantastic from a usability standpoint, and the game just plain looks great. It has a moody, drey feel that I really like.

For setup, I can't imagine playing without a Plano box; a 3650N hold everything but the full-size cards, standees, monsters, and gates. An opaque bag for monsters would be nice, but might not fit in the box alongside the Plano. Apart from that, it seems like it's just going to stay fiddly in some ways.﻿

The two rulebooks thing was very annoying for about half an hour the first time I played. Thereafter, as the game itself says, I rarely if ever used the Rulebook; the Reference Guide did its job well. I don't think I made any mistakes or missed any rules in my first play, which in my experience is a rarity for a game like this. Further plays should reduce the amount I need the rules at all, too.

I'm not sure I ever see myself playing Arkham solo again. Its length is a bug for me, not a feature, and this delivers what I wanted from Arkham in a tighter, shorter package.

---

Second play was a win, with better luck and smarter play, and it took 60 minutes vs. 90 for my first. Good all around.

Eldritch Horror fixes many of the faults Arkham Horror has but also misses some of the smaller good things. While the duration of the game is usually a lot shorter (than in AH), it still can take a few hours easily.
The base game suffers from limited amount of certain cards, but this is easily (and cheaply) fixed with the Forsaken Lore expansion (which is pretty much a must have purchase for any Eldritch owners). Another problem is the usually hopeless situation with mysteries when the AO awakens, making it too tempting just to give up (however, this is easily fixed with a simple house rule).
The story element isn't as strong as in Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness, but definitely serves the needs of most of the players.
Only notable problem I have with the game is how the mysteries are handed out in the game as some of them are too challenging if drawn too early in the game. Also the final mystery shouldn't require the investigators to complete the other mysteries as usually the time limit is too tight (it's easy to fix it with house rule though).

I'm torn on this one. Love the theme, the bits are great and the idea is awesome. The game simply doesn't come together as I hoped it would, which is primary due to its random nature. You'll often ask: "why is this happening to me again?" The narrative simply isn't woven together very well. Sad really, because there was so much potential here. Robinson Crusoe puts EH to shame.

RATING: 7
Really feels like an RPG, totally reliant on the story. That creates quite a unique gameplay from what i'm used to, but the game relies so heavily on it that it either lives or dies based on your liking of that aspect. It's quite mentally engaging, but leaves a little something to be desired for me as far as action on the board.

RATING: 5
(Based on one learning game) Arkham Horror is a clumsy mass of a game with few meaningful decisions and a tonne of random elements, but somehow I still utterly love it. Eldritch Horror streamlines all the 'stuff' and in improving the game aspect, reveals the poor mechanics while losing much of the charm. 

Also it needs expansions from the start; buy this and you're buying into a whole game system.

3rd best game of 2013.
Arkham Horror REALLY needed streamlining. Eldritch Horror does it well and keeps all the good parts. I wish the playing time was even shorter but maybe it wouldn't feel as epic. The stories the game creates are very good. Some cards can get repetitive without first expansion but otherwise replayability is great. It's FantasyFlight game so there are thousand little rules but the basic gameplay is very easy to learn (it's enough to have one player who knows rules well and he can handle setup,mythos,rule questioins etc.). I really like this game, it's the smoothest and best roleplaying meets boardgaming experience I know of.

2-Player Comment:
*Works very well for 2. No need to control more than one character each in my opinion.

Expansions:
+Arkham Dice Set
+Eldritch Horror: Forsaken Lore
+Eldritch Horror: Mountains of Madness
+Eldritch Horror: Strange Remnants

Everyone in my game group, including myself, thought this was better than Arkham Horror from our initial play. We thoroughly got our butts handed to us, but we all agreed it played a lot smoother than AH. I liked it a lot, while there was fewer of them, the encounters all felt more personalized and involved. I also like that there is less focus on closing gates and fighting monsters and more focus on trying to solve mysteries and analyze rumors. Definitely can't wait to play this one again.

I was lucky enough to playtest the base game and its first expansion so fair warning that it probably colours my view somewhat.

Of course the obvious question is 'how does it compare to Arkham Horror?' Clearly, the answer is OK, but I prefer Arkham to Eldritch. As can be seen from my ratings. Why is this the case I can't really express very well, but it may be that I find EH to be more of a board game than an adventure and it's the story-telling adventuring that I like so much in AH.

Sure, EH has more 'investigation' than AH, it even has more direct co-op interaction between characters than AH and the AO has more influence on the character of the game than AH. It plays perhaps a little shorter and is easier to teach with fewer 'rules niggles'. But, at the end of the day, AH is still my favourite game.

Pretty fun game. Played a few times but in my experience the theme doesn't really come out that much and I feel like I'm slogging through somewhat interesting mechanics. I guess after playing 3 times (didn't record solo play) I started to see some of the events again it started to lose some of its flavor. One of the events occurred for me twice in a game! By the end of the game I was wishing for it to be over one way or the other.

6 players is too many for this game.  I have only played once, and it was with 6 players, but it just took too long for what it is.  To me it is an experience game, but the included content is a little limited (vis encounter cards); once you've been through cards a couple of time I can see the charm fading quickly.

Meilleure progression du danger que dans HàA. C'est le gros plus de cette version j'ai trouvé. 
Simplification de quelques mécanismes (pas un mal, au contraire, mais pas tant une qualité quand on connait déjà par coeur HàA...).
Les décès on l'air plus fréquents, on s'attache un peu moins à son perso. Notamment à cause des rencontres beaucoup trop violentes et aléatoires, ce que je n'ai guère apprécié.
Ambiance moins sombre, moins de claustrophobie, mais fait un peu plus voyager. Système de mouvement un peu pénible, qui semble un peu trop isolé les personnages.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An awesome cooperative experience. Pretty much requires the Forgotten Lore expansion to not become repetitive quickly, mainly due to the small number of research encounter cards that come in the core box. Requires planning in general, but luck plays a huge part in the outcome of everything. Very difficult. One of my favorites. Do everyone in your group a favor and DO NOT play it with more than 6 players.

Congarts to the designer for his effort.
The game itself is a great playing experience and I enjoy it.
I really wanted to make this game my collections number ONE.
But they ruined this for me.
I'm officially tired with this company.
I said earlier that I really like this game.
What I don't like, is for someone to think I'm an *#@&#*!
We're talking about a game from a leading board game company (FFG) in the year of 2014, so , since I'm giving my good $,you have a mass appeal and you surely have the means,then :
 a)there shouldn't be any kind of errata on any cards of this or your other games !?! No more !Not again!AT LONG LAST!
 b)Replayability (aka SOMETHING UNNAMEABLE THIS WAY COMES)
why there is only 4 Ancient Ones in there ?And with just a handful of cards for each ? You're kidding me ?
Ah yes,I forgot.That's for the next dozen of expansions to come and milk us( since you shrink the components,and that way the gameplay in your games)more and more each time.And people ,for a reason I can't understand,start jumping from joy knowing that, instead of demanding more content to the base game.
 c)COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME FFG ,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS OF YOUR COMPONENTS
FROM PREVIOUS YEARS ??
Just compare those of AH with these of EH.
The tokens' quality of this game is simply the biggest joke ever,and the cards are just a step away from being used as handkerchief
What? You're waiting for a possible Reprint ? Or maybe not ?
So tired........ 
...by the way,
can someone at last,for once,please,create a boardgame that ALSO has artwork true to the spirit of H.P.Lovecraft's work?
You know,something that could really be characterized as unspeakable and ELDRITCH and not another comic strip ?
Honor the Man !

The world was not eaten tonight... We played an easy game with Azathoth as the Elder God to introduce to myself and another newbie. I'm glad I didn't have to keep track of the rules. But, the game flows easily and makes sense after a couple rounds. The choices are tense, fun, and completely engaging. I love this one as much as I hated Elder Sign. I am looking forward to playing it again and would seriously consider adding it to my collection once I have more experience with the rules.

I don't know what's thematic about moving your rectangle on a map and rolling dice. It seems like you just use dice to either get upgrades that improve your chances of rolling well, or roll dice against problems until you roll well enough. I guess I just don't get it.

Hodgepodge of story elements that sometimes don't quite mesh, but it still works quite well.  Would choose this over Arkham Horror any day.  Seems balanced enough for a 50/50 win ratio with most scenarios thus far, luck of the dice definitely plays a factor in this statistic though.

Not impressed.  Way too long for what it is.  Very little player interaction.  I don't know why either an Arkham horror or Elder Sign player would play this, although it's clearly trying to find a niche in the middle of them.  It's the boring parts of Runebound and the card conditions of Arabian Nights without the fun of either.

It's fun.  But it's long.  And it's random.

A HUGE step up from Arkham Horror, but in the end, I don't love the theme and there are other long coops I'd rather play.

This game fits an odd territory in that it FEELS like it should be a "run around the map and have adventures" type game, but it's a pretty tight coop that requires some decent planning to succeed.

I think I'd enjoy it more depending on play group.  As it stands, I enjoy it, but wouldn't go out of my way to play it.

 Arkham Horror was the second game I had ever purchased and it was a huge disappointment for me. I love the theme and I love the idea of Arkham Horror, but it ended up being too mechanically fiddly and slow for me with a lack of any interesting decisions or coherent story. I sold it after a few plays and every once in a while I drop its rating a little further as my dislike for the game grows over time. So I was hesitant to buy Eldritch Horror.

When I ordered the game, I also ordered the new expansion just to fill out the decks more. My girlfriend and I played a two player game against Azathoth without selecting a difficulty level. We managed to beat the game with the doom track at 1, but it felt like we didn't deserve it. We only closed one gate on the map and there were a few monster roaming around the board that we basically ignored. We managed to just be in the right places at the right times to deal with the first two mystery cards and the third one took some work, but wasn't too bad, while at the same time the doom track was being eaten up by some nasty mythos cards. It didn't feel like we did anything more than just draw the right cards at the right time. The story was more coherent than in Arkham Horror, but at the same time I don't remember much of what happened. 

I'm rating it at a tentative 7 right now, but it could go up or down depending on future plays. I do think it is a lot better than Arkham Horror. Just the reduction in mechanical complexity is greatly appreciated. I would probably play this rather than Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Is it better than Arkham Horror? Yeah, definitely. Would it have existed without Arkham Horror? Not at all. Eldritch Horror succeeds both at streamlining the gameplay and giving it a wider, more global feel. It increases player agency without increasing their power. The different Great Old Ones all do different things to the world, and work their evil in distinct ways. The complaints? It only has four Old Ones straight out of the box, and it's still fiddly as hell. There's a ton of cards, a ton of abilities, and a ton of things you're going to forget to do when there's five monsters on the board, your friend is one point away from insane and you have to do a thing before the next full moon. Good fun. Complex fun.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]19-Aug-2016[/u]: This is a really well produced, well developed game from FFG in the Cthulhu world. It's a cooperative game where the player(s) control a number of investigators, solving various mysteries before the Ancient One is awoken...and the world ends.

This game is big. Time and space. There are tons of cards and tokens. Everything is excellent FFG quality. Can't complain at all in that department. I think the game's strength is its narrative cohesion. I've never played Arkham Horror, but EH really presents a nice story with its variety of card decks keeping everything in line. The gameplay is based on dice resolution, and that is something that doesn't always gel with me...especially in a game of this time commitment.

I do not have any investment in the Cthulhu theme and lore, and I believe this is what ultimately made me decide this game wasn't for me. Without that knowledge and inherent interest in the theme, I just couldn't stick with it for the long haul. I'm really glad I got this game and played it a few times so that I could get that Lovecraftian experience. And for those who enjoy that, you should really give this a go. It's a solid effort.

Many ceople consider this to be a streamlined version of Arkham Horror and its successor.

Some things are done better than in AH, but Arkham Horror is still my favorite.

It reminded me a lot of Fortune and Glory.  Big scope, big setup.  For me I think it helps to take advantage of the downtime between turns and already have queue'd up what you're going to do.

Not so much a game as an adventure, but it is pretty damn fun. More fluid than Arkham in every way, just needs a bit more variety and maybe a touch more meaningful decisions. Hopefully some small expansions can help.

Is pitched just right in terms of difficulty (it's hard but you always feel like you could just nick it - invariably you are wrong). Immersive fun. some criticize it for just being a ride along game, but you can make the choices and guide the story as you wish.

Amazing game solo or with friends. It does take quite some time the more players involved in it. I know when I played a 7 player Arkham Horror, it took us close to 9 hours to play all the way through. Great game, highly recommend to anyone getting into the more complex side of games.

This game is brilliant. I spent around 3 hours playing it for Charity on tabletop day. My only problem with it is the setup time. It takes about half an hour which sometimes is way too long.

You've got to be a particular type of gamer to enjoy this - 240 minutes is very optimistic, 120 minutes is an absolute joke. However, excessive game length aside, this is a tough, challenging, enjoyable, interesting game. Another good point is that despite being relatively complex, the mechanics are quite basic so it doesn't take long to learn as a new player.

I actually think the game is fun, but it's definitely the kind of thing I have to be in the mood for. I almost wish the pacing was a little faster too. I recognize that the game is giving you time to build up your investigators, etc., but I'd like a little more pressure from the game or a more a steady progression from "ah, things aren't so bad" to "oh, we're screwed." In my limited experience, the "ah, things aren't so bad" phase lasts a long time, and then you move directly into "oh, we're screwed."

Látom a szépségeit, tisztában vagyok vele, hogy műfajában epikus játék. De nem nekem. Nem annyira magas az élvezeti érték, ha órákon keresztül csak azon van izgulás, hogy 5-6-os dobások meglegyenek. Mint egy gyenge kockapóker. Persze-persze, profi a körítés, Lovecraft világára jól ráépül a játék, de amikor elsőre 4-en 4 óra alatt sem tudjuk végigjátszani, kicsit újragondolja az ember, hogy újra leüljön-e mellé.

RATING: 3
I wanted to love Arkham Horror, but its misses were more frequent and more pronounced than its hits. 

Eldritch Horror addresses some of these issues, but after 4 plays I'm not so sure that the experience is improved.

Our first play was an easy win over Azathoth. Our next 3 plays were losses that weren't close. We got our asses handed to us by Cthulhu, then Yog-Sothoth, then Shub-Niggurath. None was competitive. They were experiences where we were out of the game, but played on for another 30-45 minutes without hope. The game does have a built-in timer, as you lose when the mythos deck runs out (mercifully).

I know that good play is possible, but it still feels like victory is determined less by good play and more by fortuitous card draws and die rolls. I think that, as someone who plays a lot of eurogames, I may just be expecting a game like this to deliver something that it isn't meant to deliver. It's an experience game that it more about the journey, and I don't think I'm wired for that kind of game. 

Note that all of my plays were 2-player games with the Forsaken Lore expansion mixed in.

Though I enjoyed Arkham Horror, this is much more streamlined and quicker to play. We can just about fit a game in an evening, including time for dinner. Rules are simple but the game is tough to beat, especially if you're as unlucky as we are in our card draws and dice rolls. Being beaten down isn't always a bad thing though..

RATING: 7
Yes - it streamlines the play of Arkham Horror. But it sacrifices rich opportunities for emergent narrative to do so. To quote one player at our table, "I feel like the game is just playing itself and I am along for the ride."

So this is not a better game than Arkham, nor a meaningful replacement.

I absolutely love this game. Already a fan of the Cthulhu mythos and Lovecraft's work in general, playing through this game with its storytelling encounters and variable player powers is exciting and compelling. Win stats at time of writing are _just_ below 50%, but I've never had so much fun losing before.

While I do like cooperative games in general, I really enjoyed this one.  It has a lot of depth and complexity of interactions which makes it difficult for anyone to take over as an Alpha player.

After my first play I find it better than Arkham horror as it plays quicker (2 hours with me running 2 investigators and rules checking). Not as rules heavy either but only just. Still plenty of conditions and game effects to consider. Found it engrossing and think I will enjoy it even more as the rules stick. As always with fantasy flight, great rulebook. Never had to consult bgg forums once. Ok amount of cards but guess an expansion will be needed after 5-6 games to add variety. Luck plays a part but so will your choices.

This is my new favorite BIG game!  This is a huge hit at my store and among my group.

My next purchase for this will be Strange Remnants and Mountains of Madness.  Already have Pyramids on pre-order!

Often referred to as "a streamlined Arkham Horror", but they threw the baby out with the bath water. What remains is a boring and one-dimensional game that feels more like playing cooperative Parcheesi on a world map than actually trying to save the world. There's no tension, no sense of impending doom, no context for any of the characters, no reason to care.

The better Arkham Horror.  Simplified rules that are easy to explaint.  But the best change is that all clues are gained through research.  And the research deck is unique to each Great Old One.  Meaning when you fight Cthulhu, all clues and flavor text will be Cthulhu related.  Much more thematically cohesive.

A nice checklist of everything around H.P.L.'s work, that is, an interesting randomizer of nasty otherwordly business. Meaning that this game is about picking a Great Old One's story and rolling with it. Move to a place, upgrade a stat, gain an item, roll some dice, fight a witch, seal off a ghastly menace.

It's [i]ok[/i], just not always as engaging as it should, more like bits of non-linked stories that... just... happen.

Similar but different to Arkham Horror. I do enjoy some of the streamlined mechanisms. Very enjoyable experience overall but I as hoping that, for once, Fantasy Flight wouldn't be putting out thirty five new expansions for the game every ten minutes...well, when I saw that the main box contained only three Ancients, I knew that my dream had died. Not as versatile and varied as Arkham Horror, but it does offer a more streamlined set of mechanisms and a more coherent story (although I still prefer Arkham's weird quirky bits and pieces of storytelling)

Opened it just yesterday after acquiring it nearly two months back. Spent about five hours setting up and playing the first game - Azathoth (3p). Did not manage to complete the game. The theme is engrossing and the various action choices keep us thinking. Initially i thought the challenge wasn't much but as the rounds progressed things went south and three of our detectives died (one devoured by a curse and two defeated in combat). 
I am sure to take this game out again and give it a spin with the right group.Update: Rating dropped from 9-7 because it hasn't come out till date

Haven't played enough to fully understand how to utilize each character to their max (we love Charlie and the Psychic). Nonetheless, this game takes at least 3.5 hours to finish which is often exhausting for my group (and the cards that make you return a mystery are just too much for us). (Edit: my group has retired this game and plan on never playing it again.)

RATING: 7
If you are considering purchasing this game take one thing from my comments here- this game is NOT a faster version of Arkham Horror! It is merely a DIFFERENT version of Arkham Horror. I suspect many looking for a 'faster, simpler' version of Arkham will be disappointed!  You have been warned.

Regardless of what others might say EH IS Arkham Horror 2nd Edition in as much of a way that Descent 2nd Edition is to its predecessor.

This means it has the same overall feel as Arkham, but with several 'improvements' to its system including a stronger narrative link between encounters & the chosen Ancient One, flip-card effects & spells from Mansions of Madness, and a more streamlined turn sequence (NOT faster- just simpler!).

It is still just like Arkham Horror in many ways, including similar game length (2-4 hours), has piles of chits & lots of cards, too many fiddly moving parts, a ton of book keeping and plenty of doom & gloom beat-down from the Mythos.

I'd say although the game is slightly easier to play it is harder to WIN then Arkham Horror by a fair margin!

It DOES do several things differently, and some things better than Arkham Horror does. It also does some things worse too.

It might sound weird but EH feels like it has more luck then Arkham! Yeah they have made the investigators & turn sequence less complex, but now I can't adjust my skills, only improve them by spending precious time stalling on a certain space! I can't easily collect clues even though they are more important in EH because I now need to have an unpredictable clue encounter first! I can't predict what gates have in store- its different every time! This list can go on & on. Yes both games are random, but Arkham has some choices! Eldritch seems to have taken even those all away, claiming they are 'fiddly'.

One of the largest banes for me is the countless condition cards and Reckoning effects, which I'm honestly sick of after just 4 games. This game all but shovels them onto you, with barely a round going by without one or more Investigators getting conditions of some kind. Then when Reckoning comes around you have to spend at least 5 minutes going through all the cards, monsters & conditions, checking them, reading text, rolling dice, moving tokens. It bogs the Mythos phase down horribly and is often much longer then Arkham Horror's Mythos Phase!

The base game also has a serious lack of cards>variation to start with, the generic encounter cards being the worst offenders. They would be fine for variety if it wasn't for the fact that almost all major actions for investigators happen in city spaces so City encounters get read almost constantly compared to those for Sea and Wilderness spaces. This means you will get City encounters repeating very quickly in longer games/with more players games.

This can be fixed in shorter games with the expansion Forbidden Lore, but re-playability is still a pretty big glitch with larger groups.

Lastly the Coop element has been all but destroyed by moving the theme to a global stage. Players have a hard time reaching different locations of the map and/or each other almost constantly with very little actual interaction, leading to a real lack of cohesion. Eldritch Horror is like a really miserable fetishist version of a circle jerk- everyone's in a circle playing on their own and crying (the Mythos is a cruel misteress). If this comparison makes you feel weird and uncomfortable then now you know how I feel whenever I play this game, and that's not how it should be..

Will it replace Arkham? At first I thought it would, but as more plays get notched I'm starting to doubt its longevity.

EH has many great ideas, and I can see how they have tried to improve upon Arkham Horror. The problem is they have made new problems and found new ways to bog down the game with moving parts, making it just as fiddely & messy in a different way. It also feels more random if such a thing is possible! So much more depends on the luck of the draw with so many strategic points rubbed out for the sake of simplicity.

Now the cult of the new hype has passed I'm feeling a little disappointed with it!

I find myself lusting for the old & familiar corners of my dear Arkham. I'm sleeping with the new, younger model, but I miss you so much.

Progressive Rating: 8-7.

A streamlined version of Arkham Horror. The healing can be carried out as an action which helps speed up the game. It can handle larger numbers of players without excessively increasing the runtime.

Setting the game up and putting it away takes forever & it can be a real problem finding reasonable space to fit it and seat the players, especially if there are 5 or more players. Then again, with 5+ players the game lasts 5+ hours, and I'm not sure if it is deep or good enough to justify that kind of length. But I like it, the theme works for me and with the right group it can get pretty intense & immersive. There is actually very little to do in the game, under it all, so it's all about the right mood.

It's damn hard to win, after eleven games I have won twice. Excellent as a solo game and also much quicker as you don't have to read everything aloud. 

Expansions are a must for variety's sake, should you play the base game more than a few times.

Nowadays Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition has replaced this a bit for me.

A regular gaming friend ADORES this game-wants to play it every gameday.  For me its too cumbersome, TONs of little bits and bobs you need to know what they do before you begin.  As a novice gamer, I really can take it or leave it (and imo the expansions only prolong the agony.)

NOT better than Arkham, but still good. A lot of the difficulty feels very cheap and inorganic though, whereas in Arkham it usually comes down to a roll of the dice. In the process of streamlining AH, they lost a lot of the soul and essence with this game. Rather than tell a short story of why something is happening, it tells you that something is happening, and you need to make a skill check because of it. Still probably a better starting point than AH is for modern gamers though. The double-sided cards are cool, and I like the way the store is handled more here. Even the way the Great Old Ones change up the game makes for a more structured experience, but the action point allowance system feels VERY restrictive here, and not in a good way. I don't mind Eldritch Horror, but I definitely feel like it plays you more than you play it. I feel like I have more control over what I want to do in Arkham, because if nothing else, it comes down to a face-off with the Great Old One.

I love the world of Lovecraft and really wants to get into cooperative games. Yet, each game of Eldritch Horror leaves me unsatisfied. It's true that the components are good-locking and the texts intriguing. 

However, it all boils down to drawing one of the many cards and rolling a number of dice over and over again. The cooperation is limited to agreeing who does what and then wait for each other to perform individual actions (and the waiting time is looong - in sessions over several hours I've only had time to move around a bit and fight a monster or two before it's time to leave). Where is the tactics? Where is the strategy?

At least I get plenty of time between the turns to work on my own games.

Un juego con un alto componente narrativo y de azar que no deja indiferente a nadie, pero no es para todos los paladares, hay partidas que han sido realmente épicas y otras que se han pasado sin pena ni gloria, con una duración aproximada de 4 horas. Superadas estas posibles barreras el juego solo puede ir a más, la sensación de llevar a tu investigador, mejorando sus habilidades, adquiriendo equipo, sufriendo estados, resolviendo misterios y en ocasiones muriendo de difierentes formas me hace darle un notable alto, sin duda promete partidas para el recuerdo.

One of my favorite co-op games out there. Very streamlined in compare with Archam and yet very good and rewarding gaming experience. The cheers whenever someone passes a crucial test to take that last clue we wanted or killing that big bad monster blocking the way to that gate we want to close, are some of the great moments that this game gives you. And all of these, without all the tiny micro rules to remember, that are spoiling your fun. And of course the conditions that will have some impact sometime in the game or the spells that you don't know what their reaction will be after making them, are giving a suspense in the game. Great work all the way.

Had a couple of solo run-throughs of Eldritch Horror last night.
Got my arse thoroughly kicked in the first game, but pulled off a win in the second game with a single investigator.  Well, two investigators.  The first one went insane, but there’s a cool rule to replace them where the crippled/insane investigator becomes an encounter you can go and have with your new character.  If successful you get all their stuff and they help you out before bailing!
Basically it’s a re-tread of Arkham Horror with a world map, faster play, simplified mechanics, far fewer cards (because of all the AH expansions) and a more tailored theme for each GOO – they each have their own event decks.  Pretty impressed overall, but makes me want to break out AH to do a proper comparison.

The base game is lacking variation; the same cards appear a lot of times over and over again (especially the Research Cards). It needs expansions ASAP to add replayability.

Ok game, not very decision-heavy as I would like it to be and events do not tie well together. This would all be forgivable and give a rating of 7, if it wasn't for the fact of low replayability. Even with the expansion Forsaken Lore, this only has about 2-3 total number of plays before an overwhelming amount of repeat events (other world and random events) start to happen. FFG, you should do better than this!

I already have enough long games, lovecraft games, and also Fortune and Glory for world-traveling stuff. I don't feel there's room in this collection where i would play it enough. However, I'm still excited to play it and try it if I ever get the chance.

UPDATE: I own this game and it's awesome. With so many lovecraft games to choose some--many of which I love including Elder Sign and Mansions of Madness, not to mention more obsucre titles like Witch of Salem or games that are similar in some ways to Arkham Horror but I like better (like Touch of Evil) this is NOW the DEFINITIVE HP LOVECRAFT GAME. PERIOD.

There is no better Lovecraft experience all in all, buck for buck, and minute per minute. This is the best one and should be considered the Cthuluhu flagship game.

I don't get this one to the table very often because of the length of the game. I generally don't enjoy games like this because I find there is too much downtime and very few choices to be made in a round. The game has simple mechanisms and lots of rules which are other things I don't normally enjoy. The theme really shines though and this succeeds as an experience it a way that few other games do for me. I'm really looking forward to the Mountains of Madness expansion as well.

Super-thematic co-op game. Games are very long and we still haven't won :), but we love the theme and the amount of story content in the encounters. It feels satisfying even when we don't win.

RATING: 8
Definitely improves on the fiddliness of Arkham Horror.  Most Eurogamers I know despise Arkham Horror, and they will not like Eldritch Horror any better.  It is much easier to setup and break down than Arkham Horror, and has some simpler mechanisms.  At the end of the day, it mostly boils down to move here, move there, draw a card, resolve it and/or roll some dice.  That being said, I like it.  I enjoyed this solo and it was a fun, relaxing time.  You need to embrace the theme and the flavor text of all of the cards in order to truly immerse yourself, and enjoy, the experience.  

Edit:  I bumped my rating up to an 8 while I let me impressions simmer for a few days.  I think it has been a while since I really enjoyed a game this much.  The theme is so well integrated and having it span the globe gives it that epic feel that seemed missing from Arkham Horror.

Great game development and production wise.  It draws you in, facilitates you believing you are attempting to prevent the destruction of the world.  The reason I don't rate it higher is only because of the theme.  Many people really enjoy Lovecraftian material, but for me it is a bit too dark to enjoy often.

Challenging.
I don't really like the mechanic that after you die you choose a new investigator. That will usually happen because there's events in the game that can instantly kill you.

I prefer Mansions of Madness first and second edition over this.

Eldritch horror is fun if the right cards come into play and the mood is right. Otherwise it's a drag waiting for the game to end.

RATING: 6.7
It's more streamlined than Arkham as popularly said
The game pacing doesn't relax as the game goes on but lack of movement speed is imho the thing that makes this game very hard

After a bunch of plays, I find myself liking it lesser compared to Arkham everytime
It is nowhere as thematically engrossing as it's predecessor and progress is painfully slow

This has been the most played game in my collection since it came out. My gaming group consists of my wife and myself and over the past few years we have become more and more invested in cooperative gameplay. Eldritch Horror easily sits on top of our list of cooperative games. It's such a wonderful and elegant system, with great components, and an excellent theme. And its on the difficult end of the spectrum, meaning that when we win we are quite happy about it. This game couldn't come more highly recommended. We also love the Lore expansion and can't wait until Mountains of Madness!

RATING: 7
Played one game face to face and one game PBF. The game "feels" like Pandemic, but with a Cthulhu theme. There are obviously recognizable elements from Arkham Horror. If the game played "faster" than AH, I would probably like it more. But it isn't significantly faster in gameplay. There is less "fiddliness" to the game, though, and I could see how that might be very appealing to a lot of people. But for me, I would prefer playing AH.

I had the game, but get bored with it and sold. Maybe it was a mistake, because later the expansions were published. But I don't regret. Maybe my taste changed and now I do not play co-ops. 
EH is the easier version of Arkham Horror. I would not say that it's better, it's different for sure. If you like Lovecraftian climate, check it definitely.

Just upped this to a 10 from 8.5. The more I play it the more I enjoy it.  My earier review below was wrong.  It is not easy.  There are easier mythos cards and easier mysteries so, if you happen to get those randomly, plus roll real well, you will have an easier time.  But now I see it is harder than I first thought.  I have yet to beat a non-solo game out of 4.  I just got the Forsaken Lore expansion and just reading some of the new cards I know it's going to be even better.  More variety and some interesting new twists. Also, I didn't realize that the Base Eldritch Horror had almost as much cards as the base Arkham Horror so it was par for the course for the base game.  Now the cards have almost doubled so I'm very excited to play again.  Buy this, you will not be disappointed.

Really fun adventuring fighting evil game.  I wish there were more cards out of the box because it feels a bit light but that would be the biggest complaint.  Also, when I've played it so far it seems a bit easy but I only played one game non-solo so far and I didn't get to finish.  Definitely awesome if you like the Cthulhu mythos and want a really fun co-op of battling evil.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] TSS'd this one solo with two investigators...  It was not easy.  Didn't start getting powered up until it was too late.  The first mystery brought out a Epic monster that feed the doom track at a fast clip.  It needed to be taken out fast and I didn't have the means.  I do like the card flip mechanics as it keeps the surprises going.  I also know this one will have a ton of expansions - so I am considering purchasing - just still a bit stingy from all the failed tests - is winning just dumb luck then?  Do want to play again, so I guess that is something.

Updates: Now on fifth play - still haven't won - however game + expansions is on its way! Just won my first game on cardboard (with four investigators - way more interactive!).  Love it.  I have solo played over 30 sessions so far (4 random investigators) - very fun game - narrative and stand-up die rolls are plentiful.  Now play with four always and have logged 40+ sessions.  Using HARD difficulty - which spawns two gates per reckoning.  The game is strategic and NOT just random.  You have to mitigate luck, be smart, and plan ahead.

Fantastic game.  If you are looking for the evolution of Arkham Horror, you have found it.  It is stream-lined, easy to teach, has a great theme, and is a blast to play.  

This will most likely replace Arkham Horror for my group.  I greatly look forward to future expansions.

Lastly, the components are fairly resilient to beer spills, which is a huge plus.

I really love the theme of this game, there are just two things to be aware of. It takes at least 3 hours, mostly 4-6 hours.

It also takes some time to build up.

This game is SOLID, with great thematic integration, unknown effects behind your conditions cards and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Certainly not an entry-type coop game, but an excellent one if you're willing to put in the effort to learn and teach it. Be aware that the game seems systematically harder with an odd number of players due to the Mystery requirements.

Too many cards and cardboard components! A few plastic minis for the player pieces and monsters would have added some variety. Dice as stat counters work better than the chits provided by FFG, but I wish the character cards had spinners like King Of Tokyo instead. Another improvement would be coloring the iconography on the cards for tests or bonuses the same as the stat in question.

Eldritch Horror is a long, text-heavy game, that is essentially a single-quest Lovecraft-themed RPG, with fiddly maintenance actions in the place of a Dungeon Master. Meh.

Oh, the horror! A lighter, adventure-driven AH? Yes, please. I was fortunate enough to run the demo the week before its release, and it was great. 

Replayablility is awesome, but the only real complaint that I have, and that most people have with the game at all, is the small number of mysteries and encounter cards. 

Fortunately, this problem is being fixed with the release of [thing=154842][/thing].

Great production, lots of fun and twists but feels unbalanced compared to "Arkham Horror". I ignore the "Rumor" cards effects to lower the difficulty, it's still challenging but feasible.

It seems to be an improvement over Arkham Horror. They are not the same, but they do the same function. EH is more streamlined and shorter: easier rules and the game flux is definitly faster.

At its core, it's move to X, draw card, roll whatever dice the card asks for, and check for sucess/fail. In that sense, it's a bit repetitive.

But the characters are very different and the personal skills is really important, it really makes a difference in how they are played.

You do the same things over and over, and you'll draw the same cards over and over (more cards would have been great; I guess expansions will solve this); ganmes will be different not because of the cards, but because of the order they appear, etc...

Up to now, I have played a 3 hours game that did not feet long (Yog Sothoth appeared on the world and we achieved an unlikely victory, so it would not have been longer with 5 players). In fact, it seemed quite dynamic and with open options, some discussions about strategy...

The components are fine, but miniatures for the characters would have been great. The theme is also well integrated into the rules.

I don't recommend it for more than 5 players. Too much idle time between turns.

About the difficulty, it's harder with uneven number of players. 

I expected this game to be something around a 7, but for the moment, I'm giving it a 8,5.

I am happy to report this is light years better than AH '05, while being different enough from the '87 AH to keep both in my collection. It streamlines everything from the '05 version, expands the scope, adds a sense of adventure, shortens the play time, and gives you a goal to work toward rather than just a "put the fire out" motif. Setup can be a chore. Looking forward to playing more.

Winning with one investigator is a real challenge. You have to pay attention to everything at once, which is tough. I may look at extending the doom track for just one for those occasions when I want the story to play out a little more and not end so early.

Yeah so the only real downside here is the board is just too much to manage for one investigator. You have no hope of controlling the gates or monsters, so you just have to get lucky with the mystery cards and Mythos card draws to win.

First win: Cthulhu, play 6.

Nice cooperative game, but like its predecessor, Arkham Horror, the process of building pressure is more mechanistic than thematic.
Still, a better game altogether, and at times, the game can create exciting story-like situations, especially with the added expansions.
Other than comparing to Arkham Horror, strong points include a lot of good text, a lot of evocative encounters and assets. As far as working together - there is pressure, but not of the sort that makes every decision count; there is an amount of leeway that makes this a relaxed fun game, somewhat counter to the general idea of Mythic Horror.

很吃運氣的遊戲
基本上都在骰子檢定
而劇情則需要靠卡牌來有帶入感
但是光是念出來有時候也是怪怪的
算是偏RPG的遊戲
策略性還好
規則:
***設置***
*次元門洗勻蓋著疊起，線索蓋著洗勻，普通怪物全部丟進袋中，史詩怪放一旁
*選擇領袖然後每個玩家選一個調查員，拿起始物品(援助卡，法術卡)跟在起始位置，還有起始體力跟神智
*決定遠古邪神，別結算期準備效果，挑出對應邪神的調查遭遇，特殊遭遇跟神秘事件卡(看牌背)
*探險遭遇卡洗勻，法術跟狀態卡分別洗勻正面朝上，剩下牌暗牌背洗勻
*根據邪神卡構築神話牌庫，先分開綠黃藍，在根據邪神卡抽對應數量組成不同階段，組成後各自洗勻在I~III疊起
*放玩家人數參考卡，根據邪神放對應末日軌，預兆標誌放在綠色位置，援助卡開四張到圖版對應位置，根據參考卡開次元門出現線索，按照探險遭遇卡頂牌牌背放探索標誌在對應地點，最後抽一張神秘事件卡並結算
***遊戲進行***
遊戲每輪分成三個階段，直到解完三個神祕事件卡(沒復活)，邪神復活的話要解第四張來獲勝
1.行動階段 由領袖開始順時鐘輪流執行兩個不重複動作
>旅行 移動一格，可花費對應行動方式的旅行票來多動一格
>休息 恢復1體力1神智 只能回到最大值，有怪物不能休息
>交易 可跟同區域的調查員換物品(援助神器線索法術旅行票)
>準備旅行 在城市可獲得一張旅行票(有鐵路才能拿火車票，船票亦然)，上限兩張，超過選擇棄掉
>獲得援助卡 在城市可擲骰做影響檢定，可獲得檢定成功數目大於左上數值的援助卡，沒辦法拿可棄掉儲備區的一張並補一張，有怪物不能做 (可選擇拿債務狀態卡一張來獲得兩個成功檢定，最多身上只能有一張)
>使用各種卡片或自己能力 所有卡片每輪只能做一次除了地點行動以外
2.遭遇階段 結算地點的狀況
>戰鬥遭遇 有怪物先由玩家選擇對每隻怪物做一次戰鬥遭遇，如果結算玩沒怪物則可在選擇做一次遭遇
>地區遭遇 選擇對應地點或普通遭遇卡，每個城市有特定功能提升的遭遇
>標誌遭遇 (可選擇)有線索可抽調查遭遇卡，次元門抽異世界遭遇卡，探險標誌抽探險遭遇卡，傳聞標誌解決傳聞神話卡，被打倒的調查員可結算遭遇
3.神話階段 抽一張神話卡並結算
>移動預兆軌，圖版如果有對應的次元門，每一個就移動末日軌一格
>結算報應效果 順序 怪物>邪神>神話卡>調查員援助卡或狀態
>出現次元門 根據參考卡出現對應數量，開啟並放在門上位置，然後抽一個怪物在該區
>怪物湧現 對應當前預兆標誌的次元門出現參考卡上數量的怪物，沒對應的次元門就開一個次元門
>出現線索 根據參考卡出現對應數量，抽看背面放地點，特定地點的就直接放
>放置傳聞標誌 指定位置
>放置驚悚標誌 放在該神話卡上
>結算神話卡效果 持續效果的放在邪神卡旁
*怪物抽出時如果有催生標示，執行其效果

I have fallen out of love with Ameri-trash games. They used to be so much fun when I didn't know any better. I loved the story, the abilities of the individual characters and the atmosphere the game creates. But, dear God, is this a terrible game to play with others who are apathetic about the lore and myth of Lovecraft's stories. You MUST play this game with fans of this genre who understand that this will take 5-6 hours to play, that turns will be interminable and that any attempt of strategy will be (usually) upended by a couple bad rolls of the die. The game is bloated with too much of everything: items, spells, clues and "tests" for everything. You never "get" anything; you have to get a good roll and that might be taken away from you later. Nothing in this game comes easy. The board is usually overrun and you always feel like you're in second gear the entire game. There is so much to do and the players usually feel so powerless against the bad stuff that I end up preemptively ending the game in favor for a better game. I would only show this game to people who love the material and have half their day to waste on a game that they'll probably lose. Sorry, Arkham/Eldritch/Elder Signs, you're a long climb for a not-so-fun slide.

It's a cleaner, more streamlined version of the Arkham Horror system, but they provide much the same game experience so there's certainly no need to have both. Everything you need to do is dependent on dice rolling. Boost your stats? Roll dice. Solve a mystery? Dice. Combat? Dice. Close a gate? Dice. If you have an aversion to dice, step to one side, this ain't the game for you. We're playing this one for the thematic ride, baby. There's lots of cards, all of which are dripping with story progression notes, and a few different big bosses to provide game-to-game variety. All of which will no doubt be boosted by the inevitable expansions. It's fun enough, especially when you can start hamming up your conditions to get the theme flowing.

My primary complaints from Arkham Horror were:

1) Too random (flip a random card then roll dice to see if you pass/fail that card... over and over and over)
2) Too long for what it is (3+ hours is too long when you're just flipping cards and rolling d6's)

Eldritch Horror fixes neither. If it were 1-2 hours, I would enjoy it more as a fun, atmospheric horror-game; but 3+ hours is just too long when you're doing the same random stuff over and over.

"Streamlined and improved Arkham Horror, but still longer than I would like."

What I like:
- Definitely better than AH
- Very few fiddly rules (especially compared to AH)
- OO-specific mysteries are awesome
- "Conditions" are really cool

What I don't like:
- Still too long (5p learning game 3+ hrs; 2p game 3 hrs)
- More encounter cards would be helpful for variety
- Sometimes letting a character die helps you win

My 5p learning game was a horrible slog, where we made almost no progress. My 2p game was MUCH better, and we actually barely won. It raised my rating from a 7 to an 8. 

There are TONS of things about this that are better than AH, and I can't think of a single think I like better in AH than this. However, I wish it would  have been trimmed by another 25-50%.

I disagree with those (like Rahdo) that there aren't many decisions to make. The game does have a lot of randomness, but it does also reward good decisions. 

I agree that the weight is somewhere above 3. It's hard to put a specific number on it.

I think it is a nice cooperative game, however I think in "Mansions of Madness", the theme is implemented in a better way. I have also the feeling that this game is very luck dependent and that it usually makes no big difference how "well" you plan your actions. What to do on your turn is most of the time either obvious or there are many possibilities that seem equally promising, but may strongly depend on how you roll the dice. However it is fun to play and maybe after a few more games, I can figure out how to distinguish between those "equally promising possibilities".

Eldritch Horror is my quintessential co-op board game. Very hard game, I'm not sure how many wins I actually have and I have played it a fair few times. But it's probably around 1-2 wins.

The good:

I just love the theme of this game. 

The narrative is very good.

The items, allies, artefacts are all great. Characters are generally good too.

The bad:

It feels like FFG never had an original or elegant thought during the design process - just make a map and let the characters hop around it.

The rules are complicated by the sheer amount of cards and exceptions available.

The missions are poorly designed. Why all the different decks? I like that there are different decks per location, but then each god has 3 decks and ... urgh. Oh yeah, and then we have the mythos deck. Why for the love of god?

Combat is unintuitive and the damage and toughness ratings complicate it unnecessarily.

Pacing is weak. After 2 hours building skills, you find you still have no chance of completing the challenges and then you put it all back in the box. Like Arkham Horror, progress is so slow that I get bored after a couple of hours and just want my table top back.

Set up takes well over 30 minutes and is not a pleasurable experience.

Forsaken Lore improved things, because it added cards to existing decks without adding more rules. Yig is good too.

Mountains of Madness broke this game for me. More new decks! And how do I know when to use the Antarctic Deck vs Elder God deck and which mystery am I supposed to be working on? 

Strange Remnants adds some good new cards and I like the missions.

3 Plays - Not a lot of deep strategy and quite a bit of luck involved. I like luck if you are able to manipulate the odds in your favour, but it still feelsl like you're shooting against the odds most of the times. The theme is awesome, but we found it later became cumbersome to have everyone read out their encounters each turn to "build the theme and story". The story aspect of the cards are still great to resolve on your own however. The game does feel exicting enough, and generally you are crossing your fingers as you watch your fellow investigators roll the dice, hoping they pull through for the team. More planning/ player control over outcomes would have made this score higher for me. Components A+

Holy Cow what a game!  8 players for my first play, and though it lasted forever that had to be the best and MOST fun I have ever had playing a board game. 10 all the way.

I think what impresses me the most are the Conditions.  Everyone was totally ok with taking debt conditions the first round of the game, until the first mythos card was played and the 'reckoning' happened.  Conditions make this game so much fun and add ALOT of tension to the game.  

The layout is amazing and fluid.  Before our first round finished, everyone had the actions figured out, within a couple of rounds, we had encounters figured out.  From that point, i didn't need to reference the rule book again until Combat took place.

WELL DONE Fantasy Flight and designers.  This is a HUGE hit in my group.

I never played Arkham, but the set up and play time just made the whole thing very unappealing. EH solves that. I know that there are die hard AH fans who say that EH is the fast food version of the real deal, and yeah, I'm sure that EH doesn't have the personality that AH brought to the table. I'm willing to make the that sacrifice to have a more concise and focused Lovecraftian experience.

The reliance on randomness for successes really makes this game a toss up. If randomness plays out pretty evenly like it should, then the game is nice and tense without being impossibly hard. But I find that when randomness occasionally causes players to waste multiple turns on spaces or you fail a test in an attribute that you are very skilled in, it feels awful and ruins the game.

Is this Arkham Horror 2.0? Hardly. It does share the theme and some of the ideas present in Arkham, but it's vastly different. I do think that an expansion will be needed after 6-12 plays as you'll have seen most/all the location fluff, but the GOOs and the Missions will keep it fresh for quite a while.

Update: After around 10 plays, the game becomes pretty rote. Expansions are what is going to save this and what saved Arkham Horror. A solid game, but if I had to choose between Arkham and Eldritch base games, I would pick Arkham any day.

One of the best adventure games I have played. I was a bit sceptical at first after reading it was a bit lighter than Arkham Horror (which I like quite a lot). I don´t think this is the case here really. If anything it´s just streamlined in a good way and since the map is the whole world, there are more possible adventure settings. I love how some of the cards used in a single game are tied to the choosen Ancient one and make each game unique and thematically connected. I love how conditions and spells are all two sided and unique so you always know that something will happen, but not quite sure what. Lot of adventure flavour, character development and adventure in this game.

Tactical, thematic goodness. Globetrotting weirdos trying to save the world from unseen and incomprehensible forces, gaining helpful allies, items, and skills along the way. Tight and difficult. Can't wait for the inevitable expansions.

Quit after about a third of the game. It was more streamlined than Arkham, but at the same time different and similar, in such a way that what I know from Arkham made me expect things to work in a certain way, and get a bit annoyed/confused when it didn't, but because they are similar in how they look, it was hard to shake the idea that it would work the way it did in Arkham. Combine that with the feeling that you weren't really doing all that much, and that a lot of the options you have on your turn seemed useless a lot of the time, and that you couldn't do the same thing twice if you failed the first time, and that the failing we kept doing got us all sorts of horrible conditions that were hard to get rid of, while we didn't really feel like we were advancing the game... it isn't for me.

Excellent update to Arkham Horror. AH used to be my favourite game, but as time went by the cracks began to show and it fell out of favour... well, this seems to have smoothed over all the cracks.

It's a well designed game and great for what it is. If you like this type of game, you'll love it. Characters have intricate and entertaining back-stories, the "test" mechanisms are employed in a way that works. I usually dislike the whole: "Roll dice to see if you win money or get stabbed with a fork." type of test mechanisms - but somehow they're done very well here and they add to the game rather than detract. Characters cooperate wonderfully & the scenarios are well written and suspenseful.

That being said, it's still a fairly long game and setup is a bit of a slog.

A worthy alternative to Arkham Horror although I'm happy to own and play both.
Because there is more teamwork and interaction, this game scales better to higher player counts than Arkham Horror, although both work well with many characters and both are great as solitaire games.
This is a better game and a Good minor theme because of the mystery and research cards being GOO related but Arkham Horror has more depth as a role playing experience and a stronger theme if you just use one of the small box scenarios for all the cards along with the correct GOO and herald (plus losing to Arkham Horror in that setup is just a case of "how badly").

Poor Lovecraft wouldn't have liked his creatures so defeatable and his universe so funny, but such is life. Until you see a character covered in Markings of Isis and with a number of amulets and magic books in his pocket get angry at a sailor on a ship for "being unnaturally strong", beating him and slapping him around with strength check after strength check until they plead guilty to dealing with dark forces, you haven't had the EH experience. Or entering the realm of Hypnos, where you suffer from the eldritch experience of a dream where you are in class with no pants.

Luck mitigation is not super strong here, though, making for a more random experience than most games. Expansions also suffer from this - you can set up a side board to defeat Hypnos, get all the clues and gates on the main board, and finish the game without having read a single card related to the new spaces.

I've played a number of solo games and one group game thus far and I have to say that Fantasy Flights has done a good job at making a lighter version of Arkham Horror.  It also fixed a few problems that AH was prone to, most notable being cooperative battles with monsters and a better spell mechanic.  Overall, it's a pretty good game.

RATING: 10
Very solid, thematic game that tells a story every time. It might be that the outcome comes down to a single die roll but that die roll doesn't happen in a vacuum. It is a result of all actions and events through the game. There is a lot of risk management and situations where you might have to send a weak investigator to face a strong monster just for the possibility of wounding it and making the job of the monster killer slightly easier.That said, it depends a lot on personal preference. For some this will be a dice-fest with random and unfair encounters and mythos cards crippling investigators right and left.

The rules are pretty straightforward and have a consistent and precise wording throughout. The weight rating in this game comes mainly from the number of rules, components and resulting interactions and edge cases.

The base game has fairly few mysteries and encounters, making the Forsaken Lore an almost obligatory addition for repeated play.

Update: Playtime is approximately 1 hr/investigator plus setup/teardown of 30 minutes when playing by reading the cards aloud to each other. Can be played in shorter time by a focused group or solo.

A gift from my girlfriend.
Tighter, faster Arkham Horror which is good. I like the cast of characters and the Mythos Phase and Investigations feel better than the clunky old systems.
Falls under the sin of Squidmonster vs Shotgunman though, only on a global scale which makes even less thematic sense. Lovecraft games shouldn't feel like an action movie, you know?

Edit. The more I play it the more I like it and even prefer it to AH. Is good times, particularly when expanded.

Great game, lots of replayability, lots of story and great mechanics. Some say this game only offers a thrill ride without much influence from the players, however, I think the player interaction provides magnificent players experience on top of the thrill ride.

I absolutely love this game. I've played about 8 times now (solo each time) and cannot wait to play again. Having lost 5 of the games, I feel there is enough challenge to bring me back for more. It is rife with atmosphere and I feel that my choices have impact...though not always for the better, which is exactly as it should be. Bought the Forsaken Lore expansion and am looking forward to integrating that into the base game. Which brings me to why I couldn't quite give it a round 10. The base game definitely should have provided more cards for each of the Ancient Ones. Adding more of these would have provided far greater longevity. As it stands, after playing, say, Azathoth a number of times I began to know what cards were likely to appear and thought to plan accordingly. I personally prefer to have the narrative unfold each time with complete surprise. But I'm nitpicking, frankly, because this is a wonderful experience and one of my favorite games of the past few years.

Reminds me of Pandemic meets Cthulhu.  You go around the world doing two actions and then you have the fun part of choosing an encounter which either boosts you and your group or causes you a bunch of problems.  The condition cards are really cool also.  Game runs really long.  The first game took 6+ hours with 7 players and people started leaving in the middle.

Expected this to be better than the author's previous games, but a bit disappointed after playing and found it very similar to Arkham Horror, and worse, no monster moving around and make the challenges simpler.

Co-op, streamlined version of Arkham Horror (but still a bit weighty). Lovecraft/horror theme is not our favorite. Player decisions take a backseat to game driven narrative; Rahdo's analogy "going for a ride vs drive" (which may be appropriate given Lovecraft theme); game is relatively easy, sometimes lacks tension. Player count is much wider than best experience.

RATING: 7
This game reminded me a lot of everything I liked about Talisman (Revised 4th Edition) without any of the things that annoyed me about it. In this game, you have a character you walk around the board, and when you end your turn in a space, you draw and resolve a card from the deck matching that space's type. The card usually requires you to make a check by rolling some dice. There are numerous ways of mitigating bad die rolls, but it can still happen. When you accomplish certain story goals, you activate more story cards, until either you win, or you flip the endgame card to see what your encounter is. Leveling in the game was quick and fun, which I liked a lot. It seemed like it wasn't too difficult to get powerful and interesting items. All in all I'm happy with this game. With 3 players I was anxious for each of my turns to come along, so I'm not sure how well this would play it's maximum number of players (8).

The twisted, oddball writing is fun but the items, relics, spells, skill upgrades, and situational condition cards really make the character building the star of the game. Unfortunately, the core of this game is.. roll a 5 or 6 to win, roll 1-4 to lose. I really wish skill checks could be more interesting.

A nicely thematic game with a lot of randomness.
I like the text on the cards that describes what is happening. It's just the right length to set the mood without bogging down the game. The game also throws a nice variety of challenges at the players to keep the gameplay varied.
However, unmitigated dice rolls are used constantly to determine success or failure, and it makes the game very swingy and potentially frustrating. There are some small things you can do to tilt the odds in your favor, but succeeding is based far too much on luck for my taste. For example, in my first game I played a martial artist who got a magical bonus to strength and found an excellent weapon early on. She was as good at fighting as a character could ever be, but she failed repeatedly when fighting enemies because of bad dice rolls. That's just not fun. Setting up and tearing down the game also take a very long time, with lots of fiddly little bits.
Overall, it's just not for me. It seems to be more about creating a funny story of failure than providing a game to play based on skill and decisions.

I found this game slow and too long for what it is.  There were turns with very little to do and when I did my encounter the card sometimes just say you failed without giving me a chance to test the encounter.  Then you can become delayed with further downtime with nothing to do.  There was not much interaction with other players to help them on their turn other than the guy would could buy things for you.  I did like the way you can build your character and collect items.  This one is not for me.

I used to really enjoy Arkham Horror, and I still do like it. But over time as I've played more and more games, the issues I have with Arkham Horror slowly got to be more and more tiring. 

And now that I've played Eldritch Horror, I didn't even realize how many little things were as annoying there. But Eldritch Horror ultimately does so many things better: 

--Movement is better, including being able to move past monsters. No longer can you just get stuck due to an annoying monster movement

--Things are much more streamlined. No longer are there umpteen different exceptions and abilities on monsters. No more focus for moving around skills. Less tracking 17 different things all over the place. 

--Dealing with monsters and gates is much better here as well. No longer do you need to move to street locations and kill monsters but not get encounters, nor do you wind up having to travel through gates and not get to do other things. 

--Finally the health system is better where healing is easier and death no longer is as bad as you just get to start a new character rather than having to play as some crippled character. 


There were some other nice additions such as conditions and a few smarter things going on with the big baddies, but all around Eldritch Horror is an excellent adventure game. It tells a fun story that is full of interesting and dramatic moments which is always what these games were going for with their heavy ameritrash backgrounds. Sure there are still a lot of dice rolls and victory can often come down to a roll of the d6, but at the same time there are some meaningful decisions that determine if you even get to that point or lose far sooner. Along the way there should be plenty of yelling and screaming about the great success or failures, the surprising twists and turns, and the crazy events that occur. In this respect Eldritch Horror and Arkham Horror are not much different, but in my mind I'll almost always rather play Eldritch as it gives me those same moments with about half of the rules and complexity and less frustrating times where it feels I can do nothing.

After testing the game out a little a couple of days before, I decided to have an Eldritch horror night... Turns out that everyone I invited made it, so we played with seven investigators. The side conversations and the casual attitude of some of our players kind of killed the ambience, but I still had a good time. We got destroyed, but I appreciate the elegance of the game and know where we messed up. I would never play with 7 players again.

The board and components are beautiful and inviting, but make no mistake: This is not a game you can play.  This is a game that plays itself, where the decisions you make are largely incidental and/or futile.

If you are twisted enough to expose your friends to this Lovecraftian nightmare of mad game design, then I suggest first completing a pre-game ritual of sacrificing your best dice upon an alter to RNGesus, praying that the randomly generated story might actually make sense, and that the game won't randomly play itself into an unwinnable board state.

The theme however, is completely appropriate.  I can actually feel myself going insane as I play a game where strategy and logic hold no power.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I love the components and the theme. There doesn't seem to be many options for making strategic choices, due to never knowing what skill you will have to roll for.  One bad dice roll can instantly kill a character.  Still fun in a group though.

If Arkham Horror was too much resources to manage for you, this game goes a long way to cutting down on that.  It's a FFG game, so of course the rulebook could be more clearly stated and laid out better.  But if you have already played Arkham, you'll find more streamlined choices.  And your battles with monsters and gates are no longer doubling as a currency when you have victories. Rounds go much faster, you do surrender control on being able to go to specific locations to gain specific items, which come more on the luck of the draw as rewards from successful encounters.

Usually, I will say that a game is not for me, but admit that the system is solid and could see why others would like it. For this game; however, I just can't see it. It feels like your just along for a long, looonnnggg, journey and that the game is basically playing you. There is hardly any way to know what skill an encounter might need, there are constant automatic damages with no saves, and after the flavor text is read you are left to the luck of the dice. I'm not saying that there is no strategy or no real decisions, but for me there isn't enough here to play for 2-4 hours. Again, I try and acknowledge when a game is just not for me, but this one does not seem like it should be considered one of the greatest games of all time. I do respect the majority opinion though, and will concede to being wrong about this, but I don't plan to play this one again.

RATING: 8
After first game: better than AH, streamlined, with a lot less book keeping and a lot more actual play. Loving it!
After another sixteen: great game, and that comes from someone who isn't a fan of ameritrash (or "thematic games" in the politically correct language). So what's so good in it? Well, it's relatively simple, a bit scripted, but still gives you a feeling of being involved in the story. It's certainly not easy and often very tense, and if you win, it's never by a huge margin. Quite on the contrary, we had many games end with a win in the last turn (witch cheers and laughter and an almost authentic feeling of relief after saving the world).

So, long story short: if you enjoyed the atmosphere of "Arkham Horror", but didn't like it's fiddlyness, get "Eldritch" - it offers the same feeling with smoother gameplay and huge replayability (especially with the first small expansion). I don't play it VERY often, but when I do, I always have fun with it - and with all likelihood that won't change anytime soon. So two thumbs up!

RATING: 7
Hoping this was going to be a mix of Elder Sign and Fury of Dracula. Ended up being another Corey K roll-a-skill-a-thon (TM). Too long, too many repetitive skill checks and while I admire the theme and the race around the world scenario, I never really connected with the narrative. EH is uncomfortably close to Battlestar Galactica, a game I loathe. Others players seemed to enjoy the discussion and planning though.

Overall, easy to learn but our game went three hours - felt 90 minutes too long. The main problem, however, is I am just not into narrative driven games with pulp fiction themes. They always feel corny and a bit too RPG-ish (I never enjoyed RPGs).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I've only played this twice, so let the record show that I need more plays.  I like this game - the theme is much more present compared to Elder Sign.  It does take a while to set up and it can be fiddly, but overall a good gaming experience.

Had to pick this one up based on what I had heard from friends (I was torn between this and Arkham, but went this direction to stay a little more streamlined).  Love the coop nature of it, but it can be a bit long which limits the number of times I can pull it out.  Also, given that may of the people in my gaming group are beginner to intermediate gamers, this game can be a little too much to get them into the theme.

Even worse then Arkham. Feels less thematic as some of the cards state that the cities are crumbling down, and burning, still nothing ever changes on the game board...

Everytime you try to accomplish something you get a random card which states a random statistic to test. Feels like a complete luckfest.

Characters actually dying or going crazy seemed to be intriguing, but sometimes 2 bad rolls are enough to get yourself killed, then you can start all over again.

I hoped that the different missions for each old god will be a good thing, but it's a get x clues to y position drag...

And the downtime...the downtime...

Beautiful game, fantastic thematics.  I've only ever played 5 players, but my biggest criticism is the time factor.  Unless rolls go perfectly (which odds are heavily stacked against), the game can easily go 4-5 hours.  Not uncommon to be 2-3 hours in before solving the first mystery, though there does seem to be an escalation factor that makes end game a bit faster. Though that's  only if you've been lucky enough to survive and gain enough cards.  The length just really weighs down the game.

Takes Arkham Horror and makes it more manageable and faster. Even though I love the loot-fest monster bash that is Arkham, I begrudgingly admit that this is the stronger game, especially since Eldritch is better at incorporating expansion content. I do miss the madness inducing, art soaked board from Arkham though, and generally I prefer a more local setting than globe-trotting. Some of the tension is lost in translation to a less restrictive ruleset, but maybe that is for the best.

Solves a lot of problems Arkham has. But is going to have the same problem with expansions, being that there's not enough variety with the core game, but expansions drive up the dificulty of an already hard game. I understand that some playgroup play it a lot and get the game down easily and can just win every time and desire dificulty. But there's gotta be a way to give us more content and give optional dificulty no?

Emergent narrative driven game pitting investigators against Ancient Ones and their minions.  Investigators will traverse globe to close gates and defeat enemies, search for clues, and more.  Game plays best with 4 investigators, but is very very long.  Expect a minimum 2 hours to play this game.

RATING: 7
A wonderful reimplementation of Arkham Horror that addresses the issue of randomness in the story lines from the original.  The amount of content in the box is just shy of staggering, but still looks to maintain a tight theme with each Great Old One having their own decks.

However, randomness still occurs in a large number of instances in this game.  The number of times I have attempted a task with a reasonable chance of success (~66-75%) only to come out with nothing should be studied, as I'm pretty sure it would redefine our conceptualization of statistics, or at least it could be the basis of a new branch.  Now, I'm being hyperbolic.  I'm pretty sure if you did a statistical study of my rolls it would conform to the expected results.  But it doesn't feel that way.  And I'm pretty sure it's because this game gives rather meager rewards for success, while crippling you for failure.  This vast difference in outcomes is fitting for the theme of the game, but it does leave a bitter enough taste that this game doesn't hit the table very often.

Unfortunately, due to the expansion glut of the original, I do not think I will be buying any expansions unless they dramatically improve the game.

I've played this four times. 

The real value of this game is 1) its sandboxy feel 2) the genuine thematic tension 3) occasional (but much too rare) fun, risky decisions.

The problem is that you will probably be bored or frustrated for most of the game.

One big issue is its huge randomness. Unlucky combinations of cards/dice happen much too often and can virtually remove a player from the game.

The game isn't puzzly or structured enough to make a lot of its cooperative aspect. The vast majority of individual player decisions/actions tend to be routine, so the game can feel like it's playing itself.

Set-up time is painful and play involves a lot of housekeeping and card checking.

The game is evocative if you use your imagination and does succeed in making you fret about what will happen next. You'd be a frosty person not to laugh a few times when playing it.

If you want a more lively and competitive Lovecraft/Cthulhu experience try the excellent 1st edition of A Study In Emerald instead (oddly its 2nd edition is apparently very different). If you want a better co-op, there are plenty around.

Really great thematic game.  Improves, I think, maintaining the feel of the setting compared Arkham Horror (where you might see a half dozen monsters walk down mainstreet).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very thematic coop game with Lovecraft theme. The gameplay is pretty much restricted to rolling a different number of dice depending on which skill is tested. The decisions are limited to which region you should move, when to rest or which problem (mystery, gate, monster) to solve (I do not understand why the majority of gamers sees this as a medium or even heavier game; probably it is the game length).

While the game really does not offer much regarding gameplay, it really shines from a thematic and story-telling perspective. The components and the art is very good. You have different typical characters with different abilities and you fight different Lovecraftian monsters. 

Eldritch Horror is certainly a good game and I probably rate it a bit too low. I just put more emphasis on gameplay than theme and for my taste there were too few ways to mitigate your luck.

This game is a story telling, race game.  The purpose is likely for entertainment not skill.   This game although less fiddly than Arkham Horror it still doesn't seem to hit that sweet spot for me and that is fun factor. The game feels like just roll 5 and 6s and you advance.  If you don't then you fail.  Not a lot of modifiers.  Its hard to move around the board and it's just frustrating as no matter what you do it comes down to 5 and 6s.  I think if you are looking for the same kind of feel but more entertainment then look to Agents of Smersh or Tails of the Arabian knights.

Another Cthulu game, a watered down sort of Arkham Horror but lacking enough meat to get into it as a game and the immersive elements of Mansions of Madness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Arkham Horror Light, best with upto 4 players. This player restriction is in part due to the rumour cards which increase in difficulty based upon the number of players and is one of the weaker aspects of the game.

Having got a few plays under my belt, I can say that I prefer this to Arkham Horror (AH).  My reasoning is that each investigator is potentially equally effective.  What I mean by this is that in AH, players typically become type cast, e.g. magic casters attack magic monsters and melee characters attack melee monsters, in order to use the teams resources efficiently.
Within Eldritch, your character starts with stats which mean they are less likely to succeed various skill checks but through items and skill enhancements this evens itself out more.
Therefore each person's character is of equal value to the success of the mission and, teaming up is possible and at times a requirement.
The turns are also streamlined , although I fear that further expansions from FF may change that.
The choosen one who must be defeated also feels unique each time and their effects on the players and the world add flavour to each game.

Finally, the coolest thing is the reckoning.  Players are no longer restricted by money by way of improving their character's belongings.  They can choose to take a debt card for example.  Life goes on for said player, until the reckoning.  At this point, all cards in play with the reckoning icon are resolved.
You thought making a deal with those unsavoury characters in order to get that shot gun was a good move.  Well, its pay-back time.
If this could be expanded somehow to include skill upgrades, this would make a future expansion even more fun.  In Cthulhu style, where every ability comes with a cost, the path you choose is defined by your actions.  This can lead to some damned if you do and damned later if you don't choices.
Making each reckoning unique is  pure genius.  Dark Pact cards being some of the toughest to endure.  For example, with the option of being effectively devoured or given a dark pact card, our hero takes the dark pact.  Only two turns later failing the reckoning roll and having to choose another player to be devoured.

RATING: 7
This seemed, on my one play so far, to be better than the average thematic dice-chucker. (It also seemed *insanely* hard - we died having completed none of the 3 tasks required, and with the doom tracker having hit 0 with only a few turns left of the 15 available.) I liked the way that things seemed to be set up for every game to be completely different (especially for each monster to have their own unique thing going on) - even down to cards with the same front but different backs, so you never know exactly what is going to happen when you flip them over.

Having said this, I still can't see myself wanting to play this very often. Like most of these so-called "thematic" games, it has a good story-telling feel but without feeling like there was a lot of deep strategy to think about. But I'd still be willing, and even happy, to play this at the moment. (I've still not played since that first game in January 2014 though...)

First impression was that this was a dice chucking fest and more of a choose your own adventure type game than an actual strategic game.  

*update - after 3 plays I am enjoying this a lot more!  I think due to the fact that you roll dice about 100 times in the game the rolls even out a bit - so there is more strategy than you might initially think.

Kann "Arkham Horror" zwar nicht verdrängen (u.a. weil das klaustrophobische Element fehlt), ist aber ein in jeder Hinsicht würdiger, etwas stromlinienförmigerer Nachfolger und eignet sich für Lovecraft-Fans, die 'nur' zwei bis drei Stunden Zeit haben. Das Spiel benötigt - um nicht rasch repetitiv zu werden - eigentlich sämtliche Expansions, besonders aber "Forsaken Lore".

This is our first FF fantasy game, and unfortunately, it'll probably be our last. It was really fun at first, but we quickly realized that it required more and more expansions to keep it interesting. The base game itself is really only good for very few plays.. For us, we just couldn't justify the continued investment. We got three expansions at the time, and finally decided to stop - there are enough games out there that will give us similar replayability out-of-the-box as this game does with all three expansions.

12-10-2014. Downrated from 7 to 6 after a game with 5 players. I think the mechanisms in this game are good, but downtime and length make the game unappealing to me with 5. I think I'd like the game a lot more with 3.

26-12-2013. Excellent COOP. I haven't the slightest idea on how to beat it. I like the flavour, the artwork is gorgeous.

My biggest issue with the game is that player turns are resolved seperately, but the all locations are resolved at the same time. It can become a little long to fight all your battles/close portals and soforth.

Another downside —I can imagine being solved easily with expansions— is that the cards are fairly limited in number, so that you often encounter the same occurances twice. More cards, equals more diverse stories and less repetition which would greatly enhance the game for me.

An improvement over Arkham. Seems more streamlined a more focused goal on solving mysteries. The Ancient One specific research and mystery decks make for a more consistent narrative arc, but I still find it difficult to get into reading random story bit after story bit, even for my very imaginative wife. I just wish FFG would finally dumps a lot of fiddling as of the constant test rolling, decreasing/increasing health/sanity, and instead make a game more like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective but in the AH universe.

Just played with 5 players and it took the recommended 3 hours (after 1 hour of set-up and rules clarification). But for me the game dragged and felt like I just spent the whole game waiting for nothing to happen. 5 players is too many because there's nothing to think about while waiting for your turn to come around because there didn't feel like there were any meaningful choices to make, just dice to roll. The game play just feels tedious.

The game does a great job involving the theme into the game with art and interesting flavor text. But I'd rather play Elder Sign, which approaches the thematic quality of Eldritch Horror but does so with streamlined game play.

If I am looking to play an epic game crossing a world map and rolling dice to decide events, I'd rather play Fortune and Glory, which has a much faster pace and more excitement. The one thing that Eldritch Horror does better than Fortune and Glory is that it does a good job being thematically consistent (events are determined more by where you are on the board).

We lose so many players, and didn't know how to manage their powers, benefits and items.

I rate games using what their intended design was as a yard stick. This game is meant to be a thematic, dice heavy game that tells a great story. Luck and randomness are in this game, but can be minimized by playing smart and to your investigators' strengths. All this allows for a game with endless variety and twists and turns that keep you on your feet because anything can happen. It's fun reading the lore texts on the cards as you resolve rolls, whether with good or bad results, it really tells an amazing story thats different each game. Speaking of different, I highly recommend getting as many expansions as you can. They all add so much cool variety to every aspect of the game.

Terrible, just terrible.  People say this game has theme, but it doesn't.  It's just a series of random events that aren't connected to your group's overarching mission (because the events have to be used with all missions) where random stuff happens to you.  The events are so similar that they blur together and aren't memorable---creepy cultist, mysterious book, feeling of foreboding, etc.

The core mechanic is moving to locations, having a random encounter decided by dice weighted against you, and watching what random crap happens to your character when you fail.  Not fun and takes forever.  Burn it with fire.

I kinda love-hate this game. I really enjoy globetrotting and building up my character, but the game kinda forces you to deal with other stuff (particularly gates) or lose. Character death happens easily but isn't super bad because you can more often than not recover the assets and doom (but not increased attributes) that you've lost. The dread this game creates is great (not as great as AHLCG) but the ending is usually anti-climactic. The difficulty levels are flat out broken as odd numbers are harder than even numbers. The mythos deck needs to be assembled carefully to prevent stupidly easy or stupidly hard games. But when the balance is juuust right and it all comes together, it's a fantastic experience that you could be talking about for days.

This game has also made me shout and throw components more than any other. I've churned through several (as in, roughly 7) of my characters die in one game. More than once I've wondered why I'm even playing this damn thing. But I keep coming back.

This is the follow-up to Arkham Horror, instead of focusing on the town of Arkham, you're now globetrotting to fight off the Great Old Ones. From a thematic standpoint, it's a little weaker than AH, just because things don't totally make sense. Why do I go to Australia to gain strength? No gyms in London or San Francisco? The story is also more grand/less personal, and feels a little jumpy. I don't find that a major problem, but worth mentioning. 

While the theme suffers slightly, the mechanisms are improved a lot. Much of the rules minutiae of AH is gone in favour of a smoother and cleaner system. No more focus, no more money, monsters generally don't move, there are clear objectives in play, replacing the frantic 'run around town and plug holes' of AH, and if the Great Old One awakens you have a shot at literally defeating them. It's not a great shot, and it might be slightly anti-thematic to believe a few adventurers could dynamite Yog back to his(?) home, but from a gameplay aspect, it feels much more encouraging. In addition there's a really good new mechanism in the form of status card. There are status cards such as debt, injury, or dark pact, and you don't know what the drawback is until their triggered. So you may be traveling around with several personal demons and they might all confront and hinder you at once. Very, very cool. To top it off, the game plays in about 25% less time than AH, being that that's somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes, that's a considerable upside.

This sounds like a pretty glowing review, but honestly, playing just made me want to play AH. Eldritch Horror has a lot of upside, and probably the biggest is that in it's sleeker form, is just more likely to be played. I'm confidant I could teach the crucial rules to EH in under 10 mins, and I'd be happy to play it, but it doesn't offer the same level of immersion of Arkham. That's really it's only problem (you could argue EH has too few cards per deck), but that's the reason I play this sort of game, to experience the adventure of the characters, and Arkham does -that- (and maybe not much else) better.

RATING: 7.75
This game has amazing theme and a great sense of adventure.  The negative for me is the length of play as luck in dice rolls and encounters is a bit too much.  Just drags the game on at times.  Also, don't play with an odd number, as certain victory conditions are equal to half the players rounded up.  Also, there are a few negative effects that literally take away an entire completed objective.  No way!  Just makes it longer and less enjoyable for me.

RATING: 3
This is barely a game. Stopping on every player's turn to read "flavour" text does not make a game immersive, it makes it a stop-go bore-fest. Adding insta-death events just piles on the frustration, "oh good, I can start a new character while you're all tooled-up and getting on with things".

A game I will make efforts to avoid.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, but pretty fiddly and very long. I definitely don't mind losing, especially in a coop, and I just expect it if it's Cthulhu themed, but it can be a little disappointing to spend 30 minutes just pulling out pieces and stuff and then spend 3 hours getting completely beaten down.

That said, I don't want to complain too much! It certainly mitigates some of the randomness of Arkham, but there is still a LOT of luck, and as long as you know what you're getting into I think it can be a blast. The theme really comes out and I love the flavor text.

By far the most complex board game with longest gameplay that I have so far, but engaging theme and solid play. Solo play requires playing multiple characters. So far only solo-played with 2 characters, which is playable, but more characters on the board would make the game easier so you can cover the board more. The game would come out more often if it didn't have so many components and takes a while to set up and tear down. Also, it takes up a LOT of table space.

Tras haber sufrido Arkham Horror en una única partida horrorosa, Eldritch fue un soplo de aire fresco. Mucho más narrativo y mucho más simple en su mecánica, reglas y explicación de juego.

Dos partidas y dos derrotas han supuesto una pequeña frustración para mi chica y para mí, quizá el azar del cierre de portales sea un poco descontrolado. Un gran juego de todos modos.

Tras varias partidas más, se confirma para mí que se trata del mejor temático al que he jugado. Variado, emocionante y, con las expansiones, muy rejugable. El único pero, quizá su duración excesiva. Gran juego.

Well, now I know why I had a feeling my Arkham Horror collection was on short legs.  This game encapsulates the same feeling with a fraction of the headaches.  I love the different reckoning timing mechanisms and how the assets stop people from camping out at the shop.  This game takes all of the good of AH and leaves out a majority of the fiddliness.  It's great stuff and an instant classic in my book.

RATING: 7
Your goal is to stop the Ancient One form rising to the surface to take over and destroy the world.  The play is co-operative.  You are investigators trying to stop the Ancient One.  The terror and adventure the investigators go through in order to stop the destruction is fun and exciting.  At times it can be a little slow when one investigators turn takes a little longer.  The co-operative play is fun; however, there is a lot of room for investigators to go their own way and not consult the rest of the investigators (this may be fixed depending on the group in which I choose to play with).  The mechanics are simple and easy; however, the rule book is a bit large and can seem intimidating.

Better than Arkham Horror, which I loved for a period of time.  Streamlined in the right ways, successful at telling an evocative story, capable of presenting difficult and meaningful decisions.

My only caveat - it still can take a while to play. 4 hrs+, if you have a slow group or are taking your time reading everything and collaborating decisions.  And that makes it a bit of a challenge for a parent like myself.

RATING: 5
On first impression if feels like a cross between Arkham Horror and Tales of the Arabian Nights. Overall feeling is one more of a thematic ride than a co-op to be solved. 

Gates matter less or at least closing them doesn't [i]feel[/i] that urgent. Monsters can be avoided. The doom track is not as ominous as in AH. But most of all there's less of a need for cooperation and common strategy in comparisonsto AH. And the map of the world enforces the feeling that these investigators are moving in parallel, each doing their own thing. Like in TotAN. 

Another thing closer to TotAN are chaotic events - as stats of characters never change and items are hard to get by (if your influence isn't high) most encounters are very random in outcomes - they'll hit you, or won't. And you'll get certain statuses you'll try to get rid off (kinda like TotAN). In comparison to AH there's less tension and the feeling of sliding towards inevitable doom, instead it's more of a rollercoaster with some ups and downs (but more coherent, nowhere as crazy as TotAN).

What does it all mean? Well I'm actually happy they decided to move more into a story driven territory and made EH even more of an adventure game than AH was. On the other hand I'm a bit wary as how replayable the game is story wise (and how much it will need expansion). AH in comparison is more player driven and has an emergent narrative. EH take you for a ride, yet it is easier to get into and it does fix many rough edges of AH. It is easier to get into. On the other hand it doesn't feel as exciting or special, it's more even. Certainly there are remnants of MoM - the cards with different effects written on the back, the more story driven, yet less emergent, approach. Feels like this one is made more for expansions than AH. Maybe I'm weird, but I miss the gaps (and sometimes huge crevices) in the game that I have to feel in. It's more like being taken for a ride.

Played first game with two and lost badly even after messing up several of the rules to our advantage (actually probably closer to 50/50).

Fun, light-medium grand-scale co-op game. Like most co-ops, however, you get what you give- the more players there are, the more downtime between turns which can lead to bored players if they're the type to not stay too engaged when they're not on deck. Also similar to a number of other co-ops is what seems to be a pretty variable game length- some games end as quickly as 30 minutes, others can get up to two hours.

Edit in 10/15- over the last year or so this game has crept (or perhaps shambled unknowably) into my top ten. What an excellent game.

Polished Arkham Horror, shorter setup, no messy monster movements and spawning thingies. The only thing I would not recommend is to play it with 7-8 investigators.

A superb complimentary game to the beloved Arkham Horror and one that may even see more play than it's bigger brother as I delve into it more frequently. This is simply because it has has two distinct advantages over Arkham Horror:

i) Less reliance on dice rolls
ii) A far shorter play time

These two things also mean I'm far more likely to get my friends playing it, which can only be a bonus.

This was the first "lore heavy" game I bought. I played Arkham Horror with a friend and it was a bit heavy for me. Eldritch Horror however is all the good stuff from Arkham but it's just much more fluent and easy to play.

The rules are not to difficult, the lore in this game is amazing, the characters are fantastic and the elder ones each have their unique traits.

We don't win all the time (which is a good thing), so it's a great feeling to defeat the game as a team !

I took a chance when I bought this because I never really had an enjoyable game of Arkham Horror, the predecessor in this game system. I'm glad I did because this is a way better version of Arkham Horror. It just feels... streamlined. I especially like that gates are resolved in a single card instead of the player having to take multiple turns in the other world.

It's just straight awesome and I look forward to many more playthroughs.

Only negative is that it drags on, but I kind of like that fact when it's this fun. :)

Phenomenal story driven co-op. Play as investigators travelling around 1930s? world during a impending awakening of an Ancient Evil God. Once you overcome the inital hurdle, very easy to play and maintain. Due to heavy use of die rolls and relatively simple nature(of rules), Not prone to too much quarterbacking.The game however is hard and I highly recommend to make a balanced team or else you will lose every time!
EDIT : Also maybe use the Mythos Deck Difficulty variant. The hard Mythos cards mid-game can be brutal.

The game is unbelievably linear. The decision-making doesn't exist here. Moreover, everything comes down to rolling a set of dice.

Go to the place X, roll a die to roll a die to go somewhere else and maybe roll 2 twice if not get a curse and roll a die so maybe you'll have an opportunity to roll a die...

Lovecraft-themed exploration/adventure game; the spiritual successor to Arkham Horror.  I really like character abilities, leveling potential, and variation in active threats and ways to overcome those threats.  The fact that we continue to lose this makes this game more and more interesting.  I think there are min maxing strategies we need to discover and exploit in early game to win this.  At the same time, there's a consistent sense of losing to RNG that makes this game aggravating to play and keeps my rating low.

This is almost like a DungeonQuest Advanced. Going into a room and drawing a dungeon or trap card, is like going to a new location and drawing an encounter card in EH.

EH does have MUCH better combat too... If you like DQ, then EH is the next level

30+ plays later, I'm not sure I'm in love with it as I used to be, at least as a 1-2 player game.

I still like it a lot for what it is: a fun, pulpy globetrotting adventure around the world trying to put a stop to an Ancient One.  But you're just along for the ride.    

Games can be an uneventful walk in the park, a quick and unceremonious defeat, or a long and drawn out affair where you just want the game to end.  You're completely at the mercy of the dice and mythos deck for what kind of game you may have.  

If you're OK with just going along for the ride and experiencing the story being told, great!  But I've just found that the amount of setup and upkeep involved for the game doesn't really match the level of actual engagement I get from the game.  Once you see the events enough time, the theme starts to wear off and it becomes less fun.

Expansions have added more Ancient Ones, events, monsters, items, etc, but rather than invigorate the system, they've ultimately felt just more of the same and made the whole system bloated.  

Also, having played Arkham Horror, I'm not convinced this game is any shorter.

Very fun, very tense, richly and deeply thematic, epic scope. FF has a lot of titles in the Cthulhu genre, but none so perfectly captures the sense of the best Lovecraft stories like this one. Crunchy rules seem a bit daunting at first, but they become intuitive very quickly and the game engine just runs itself so smoothly that the mechanics fade into the background.

And then you all die or go insane. Because Lovecraft.

It is a long and difficult co-op game, and I'm not super into the theme. I do agree that it tells a story well, but I'd much rather play Robinson Crusoe than this.

UPDATE: I've gotten a bit more into the theme, and I like how the components interact, but man, it's just so long! I wish that somehow it could be compressed into about half its length, although I'm sure that would rob it of some of its complexity.

RATING: 7.5
A slightly lighter, more streamlined version of 'Arkham Horror', set on the world stage (rather than in Arkham itself).  Still not a light game, though, with lots of rules and subrules/qualifications, and plenty going on.  But easier for players to get into than AH.  Very nicely produced by FF.  Will probably not replace Arkham Horror entirely, but is likely to be played more often, I think.

Cooperative storytelling game that I find difficult to rate. For the type of experience it offers, Eldritch Horror is pretty good. At its core, it's a game of rolling dice and watching what happens. 

It would be frustrating if I cared about winning or losing, but in a game like this with zero difficult decisions, I'm willing to go along to get along. But I would only ever play with at least one experienced player running the game and taking care of the fiddly bits.

RATING: 8
Pros
- Lots of content/playtime in the box for lots of replayability
- Great component quality
- Ridiculous monster names and situations are a lot of fun to read aloud

Cons
- Overly complex to learn and some rules are more fiddly than they need to be
- A string of bad rolls can sink your strategy, no matter how good your decision making is
- Playtime can be anywhere from 1-3 hours depending on what happens (2 players), so it's hard to fit it into a set period of time that you want to play

This is a great cooperative game to play when I'm not in a super "thinky" mood. Ridiculous situations happen every time and no two games seem quite alike, due to the variability in mysteries, clues, and Mythos cards. Highly recommended.

I think this game may have completely replaced Arkham Horror for me.  Now, if you like Arkham Horror this game really isn't necessary.  I like Arkham Horror quite a bit myself but bought this game because my wife finds Arkham Horror just a bit too convoluted and fiddly and wanted to try this instead.  But I like this just a wee bit better (my wife a lot more so) and it is more accessible so I think I'll keep this one on my shelf.

This game is like a streamlined Arkham Horror and the game is going to feel very similar for anyone who has played AH.  In this game players again choose investigators and travel around a map (this one showing locations across the world) closing gates, defeating monsters, and finding clues in service of preventing an Ancient One from Lovecraft lore from entering our dimension.

Each investigator has special powers, as do each of the monsters and Ancient Ones.  There is also a wealth of spells, items, allies, conditions, artifacts, and more that add variability to the game.  The key difference between this and AH though is how the game is actually played and won (or lost).  Instead of trying to seal gates or defeat the Ancient One in a final battle, this game has a bit more narrative and the investigators are completing assorted different tasks called "mysteries".

There is still the sealing of gates to prevent more monsters from entering the world but the actual meat of the game feels a lot more interesting because there are different tasks each time and actually feel like they add to and do service to the story.  If the doom track reaches zero instead of going head-to-head with the Ancient One there is a final mystery the investigators can try to complete before losing outright.

Along with that there is the thing that attracted my wife to this game over AH in the first place, it is a lot less fiddly and more streamlined.  There is still a lot to set up but everything is more easy to understand and the pieces move a lot less in this game.  Also the rules are streamlined and more clear than those in AH so it is much easier to teach to new players and get them involved.  I will say that one downside to this streamlining is there are sometimes less options on a player's turn and we found ourselves occasionally wasting one of our two available actions because there wasn't a good option available.

Also, like other games with stories or scenarios as part of the gameplay content can be an issue (such as Mansions of Madness which I quite enjoy but would never spend money on).  This game only has 4 Ancient Ones and repeat plays are going to feel similar as you attempt the same mysteries repeatedly.  However there is so much other content in the 12 different investigators and tons of different assets, spells, and conditions that I think each game would feel different enough until you felt the need to buy one of the inevitable expansions (you know it's coming, just look at the amount of stuff they released for AH!)

Like I said, I can't recommend this game for someone who has and enjoys AH because it's not needed and most are going to want to stick with that game.  But if you are really looking for that game in a more story-centric and accessible package, then this one is a winner.

While many aspects of 'Arkham Horror' have been admirably streamlined for this game, it's dripping not only with theme but the same unfortunate 'What effect did you forget to apply?' curse as AH. Modifiers and special conditions abound, each one a memory test as the game asks the players to keep much of their focus on the fiddly requirements of what needs to be changed with each phase, each dice roll, each card draw, each manipulation of the many components. If this sort of thing isn't a problem for you, EH keeps much of AH's mood and detail while promoting a more coherent storyline, so you're probably in for a quite a good time.

Rated after 12 plays.  If you had asked me 6 plays ago, I might have given this a 10.  It's an excellent cooperative game with a good amount of flavor and theme beset by some relatively boring mechanics.  I enjoyed the game immensely in my first 4 plays, which were all losses, and liked it a lot more when we finally won our first two games.  When you finally play the game enough to understand how to win, it's a euphoric feeling.

However, here is where the trouble starts.  Once you've figured out how to win, much like base Arkham Horror, it is very hard to lose.  We have since won 6 more games, for a total of 8 straight wins.  Over that stretch, we found ourselves growing restless and bored.  The problem is that the base game has an exceedingly poor variety in the cards on offer.  There doesn't appear to be much balance here at all.  Decks that will get used significantly, such as the Locations decks, only have 8 cards, so by your second or third game you've literally seen everything there is to offer.  Conversely, decks like the Expedition encounters, of which you may go on 1 or 2 per game, have 21 cards.  The other world deck is 24 cards, despite the fact that closing gates is not as big of a priority in Eldritch Horror.  It just feels like FFG got extremely lazy here.  The first expansion is almost necessary just to keep the game from getting too stale.

Beyond the problems with the decks being either far too small or too big, the gameplay itself is not particularly great.  Unlike Arkham Horror, rolls are not nearly as tense this time around.  Whereas you might have to get multiple successes to succeed at checks in Arkham Horror, in Eldritch Horror just one success is enough to succeed at almost every check in the game.

It's just little things like the above that add up over the course of time that unfortunately make this game feel like less than the sum of its parts.  I have purchased Forsaken Lore and hope that it will improve my rating of the game.  I am not holding my breath, however.

EDIT:  While Forsaken Lore does actually beef up the decks that need to be beefed up, it also adds my most dreaded expansion element:  cards that do nothing for you in order to try and balance the game's difficulty.  I absolutely hate it when an expansion does something like this in order to make a game more difficult.  What exactly do I mean?  Well, in the base game, Research Encounter cards that have an Attribute-1 test will almost always result in you gaining a clue and one additional clue.  In Forsaken Lore?  Such cards may grant you just one clue or even NOTHING POSITIVE AT ALL.  It is so deflating to pass a relatively tough test on a research encounter only to find out you basically wasted your encounter because all you did was avoid bad stuff.

Rather than making the game more difficult in an organic manner, such as making tests more difficult through modifiers or altering AOs' doom track starts, FFG decided to do it the arbitrary way by just not rewarding you as much or at all for taking certain encounters.  I don't like this change one bit and it has caused me to like this game even less.

I like it.  Not as much as Arkham Horror though. It's advantage over Arkham is reduced play time.  For me, that's not much of an advantage.  The vast majority of my games are shorter than Arkham and Arkham is one of my few options for an epic experience.  I prefer Arkham because it tells better stories and feels epic and memorable.

Whether to get this or Arkham is a play time versus Epic feel choice.

I great streamlined follow up to Arkham Horror. This puts the players on a global scale battle to defeat the old ones from the Cthulhu mythos and save all mankind. I've enjoyed playing this game by myself but I do play as two investigators when I do. Almost unplayable with a single investigator as the difficulty is made easier the more players you have. 3-5 seems to work well and even though the game advertises that it plays up to 8, having more than 5 greatly extends the play time and most importantly increases the time between turns to a point where players lose interest in the game.
The only complaint that some people may have about it is the lack of detailed flavor text in the tasks that you undergo leading to a relatively generic feeling unless you are the type of person that enjoys filling in the backstory for your character as you play.

Absolutely love the game. Even my friends that weren't really in to gaming really got into this game. It's pretty easy to explain once familiar with the rules, and plays pretty smoothly after a few turns. The only problem I have to mention is the box, of course, being an FFG game, I wasn't expecting an amazing insert, but I'm going to have to make my own just to make setup easier. Still, would totally recommend this game to anyone, probably even beginners. Seems much less complicated than Arkham Horror, although I haven't played that one yet.

Eldritch Horror is the Cthulhu I was looking for. It is complex without being overly complicated, it is richly thematic, and it plays smoothly. The investigators are well-designed and I love how they added the way to encounter them if they die or go insane. I also love how each Elder God has his own narrative that runs through a game. This is what every other Cthulhu mythos game was meant to be.

Rather good game of the cooperative, theme-heavy genre. Unfortunately it occupies exactly the same niche as Arkham Horror does, which is better in every perspective (is much more involving, more variations, better to scale in difficulty and players).
While the rules are streamlined, this does not help much as the game is still long (basically the same as AH). This game simply misses so much and doesn't give back enough. And it's not even a much quicker game. If it were 2 hours top I'd give it at least an 8

Excellent theme play!  Game fairly easy to learn and play.  Plays differently from Arkham Horror, yet it retains the same feel.  Can be thought of as a streamlined AH.

Our first play took 3.5 hours, but will drop considerably.

Now have a few games under my belt and starting to feel that this does improve on Arkham Horror. The game is much easier to teach and flows a lot better without getting bogged down in mechanics. That said, there is still an awful lot of exceptions and minor rules to keep track of. I think I have yet to play a game 100% correctly. Like Arkham, the random nature of events makes the game feel not so immersive for me, and not really capturing the theme of Lovecract's original tales. Events happen completely at random and after a few turns the game feels completely saturated with events and actions to tell any kind of coherent story or plot, despite this being praised as a "story game" in most circles. Ultimately, the game does not pack enough meaty decisions to be interesting to me at all in the long term.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game but feels a bit too random for my tastes (random quests, random card draws, random die rolls, random clue tokens, random portals, random everything).

Wish there were more cards so you didn't see repeats of some things and wish it was more interesting without being a dice fest. Not sure there is an easy fix to it without redoing the entire system, but for what it is it is definitely fun.

I'd give it a higher rating, but the games I've played have felt a bit samey and I question its longevity.

EDIT: After playing with some more expansions the game is much better. I do question the balance of the game, as it can be super swingy at times, but overall the experience is much better now. The game basically tells stories that will last a long time.

EDIT 2: Decided to downgrade my rating. I have to be in the mood to play the game now as it takes so long to set up, take down, and go through everything. Also, some games are super swingy from either being super easy or basically impossible. Wish there was more strategy and stability in the game. The story and theme and variety is amazing, but all that can be for nothing if you simply roll poorly which hurts due to the duration of the game.

My first game wasn't great.  It was good.  However, I'm thinking this will have a lot to do with the Mythos deck and since it varies from game to game, you'll have home runs and strike-outs.  I'm okay with that and am looking forward to my next playthrough.

love this game, too luck dependant, but im a sucker for story based thematic game, beat all of the ancient one but not cthulhu... that one is hard, after getting the new expansion.

we now just managed to beat it down to the last mythos card... very satisfying, but still the game is very hard, not all game will be end with winning, need some heavy luck also to win, kinda a turn off but the theme is what im searching for from game like this, so i still like it.

getting the expansion for more story and random encounters. getting a bit bored after 10 games and encounter the same old encounter cards in city lol.

with the right game groups, this game is a blast.

EDIT: so after 18 games of playing it wrong... we were stacking the stats point gained from assets... last night we played with the right rules of no stacking stats, almost win azetoth but time was called... too bad.

3 games we played with correct rules, we lost lol. I think the game is just too hard, and dice rolling is like luck fest, so need to tone down the difficulties.

@6th games with correct rules, finally my 1st win against azathoth.

An improvement over Arkham Horror, with less tedium.  Needs more expansions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good game. Very similar to Arkham Horror, but gameplay on a global instead of local scale.

Adds some very nice mechanics to 'basic' AH: 
- spells each have individual after-effect, which you only will know after you have cast it. Same goes for conditions (you don't know what will happen to you before effect triggers).
- "Pass the torch" principle. Dead/insane investigators become lootpiles of equipment, but you might become grieved by their fate/stories if you visit it.
- Expedition encounter which moves around the map if you have 'solved' the previous one. This is very thematic and fun (expedition hunting).

Also adds some mechanics that don't really add:
- each 'endboss' has a different deck of challenges. However, these seem not tied in to these bosses very thematically (we used the wrong set and didn't even notice).
- you are no longer forced to encounters, other than monsters. So sometimes you can choose between having a Clue encounter, a city encounter, a Continent encounter, a gate encounter or an expedition encounter. It technically gives you more freedom but actually it feels as if you are more constricted (after all, only one instead of everything).
- a global market (called 'Reserve' for some reason). While this adds to the actions you can do in a turn, it is not a fun way to boost yourself. Better would've been a market tied into each location (so samurai swords in Japan, guns in San Fransisco, tomes in Arkham Horror, etc).
- each investigator has abilities that really drive your play. They don't only add, but really define how you should play with them. While this might be thematic, I can see it will wear off quickly, needing an investigor expansion (more investigators) to keep it fresh. Typical FFG style.

And finally subtract some fine mechanics of AH and/or add some mechanics that do not work:
- Personal sliders for abilities. In AH you had to weigh each turn where your character would try to specialise on. This made for some tough and fun decision. Here you have a set of static abilities which you can upgrade, much like in Runewars or Fortune & Glory. This is easier, but it removes a fun part of the game.
- You don't get a personal gain if you defeat a monster/close a gate. In AH you collected it as a sort of 'dark currency'. This really added to the feeling, whereas this feels more as Pandemic 'disease cleaning': necessary but in this game (where it is all about adventure) not the most fun to do.
- Travel has been implemented kind of sucky. Whereas in AH this was part of your tough 'start of turn' decisions, here you get a set of two actions to spend on various things. Worker placement style. Much like in World of Warcraft, this does not match with the adventure genre well.

All in all, while being a fun game, I won't be playing this over Arkham Horror which I like much more. Though the rulebook of AH is horrible, and it has lots of small rules which you might miss (so this combined can make for a frustrating learning experience), it is a much better game for my taste. However, Eldritch Horror is certainly not a bad game either, so if you want a decent Cthulhu game, you like F&G and AH was too fiddly for you, this might be the game you are looking for.

RATING: 8
Eldritch Horror - I have always been interested in the world of HP Lovecraft. I definitely did not want to play the excruciatingly long Arkham Horror from everything I had read. When this came along I was instantly interested. I have played 5 times now and never won yet. It's really difficult.

Here is a mini breakdown:

Length - Long. Each game has been 2-2.5 hours. Luckily turns are quick so you keep engaged. So far Jessica's 'Bored-o-meter' has not gone into the red. That may be because she is on summer break. Last night I played with 3 and it took 2 hours just to try and solve the first mystery(you need 3) and then we lost. It has many timers: doom track, mythos cards running out, investigators being devoured and rumor cards coming to fruition. So it does end eventually. I could not see playing this with a large group. It would take hours. If everyone is swift and reads their cards quickly it moves along. April is AP prone and chatty so she slowed the game down last night. It's fine we lost anyway.

Difficulty - Hard. The basic mechanics are simple. All investigators take 2 actions, have one encounter (read a card) and then the monster goes. What makes it hard is that the game beats you over and over the head. Because the theming is good it doesn't make me mad that at that last moment I was about to solve a mystery my clue tokens were taken away by a draw of the card. You have to take it in stride that this shit happens in this game. Just when you think you have it, you don't. Usually at that point all hell breaks loose and the game ends rather quickly. That's also what keeps me playing.

Game play - Our first 2 games we just got beat up and never really got close to solving anything. Then I realized there was actual teamwork needed and efficiency. We got better, closer, we solved 2 mysteries of the 3...and then victory was snatched away by a horrible event. Grr. All hell broke loose and we lost. 

This is what happens. I do believe there is a level of play we have not figured out yet. Now that we know that certain crap can happen we are preparing for it better. We are picking better investigators for the job. You can partially mitigate the luck. I don't think you can prepare for everything (Especially with dice probability determining most everything). Also, each Great Old One is unique and makes the game play differently. That means new tactics will be needed. Very interesting. I'm hoping it makes for a different flavor each bad guy. 

I also discovered that you can take out "hard" cards and have an easier time. I'm going to try that just to see if we can actually win the game.

Final Thoughts - I like it. It's not as freewheeling fun as Defenders of the Realm. I really enjoy playing that one (chessiness and all). Eldritch is like a Pandemic on PCP. There is a lot going on. You can lose focus very easily. There are fires to be put out everywhere but you can somewhat ignore them for a bit. It's not cerebral. It's a discussion game. Planning is necessary but you can always count on being set back or losing that plan. You can't play it with the hope that your plan will succeed. There is a 50% chance it won't. 

You roll a lot of dice and read a lot of cards. Want to do something? Read card,roll dice. Want to get stuff? Read card, roll dice. Want to level up? Read card, roll dice. The theme holds it together but you must read the cards out loud or you will just be going through the motions. 

[b]It's a good co-op that needs multiple plays to enter it's world but a little bit messy and it's going to kick your butt. You have to enjoy the Fantasy Flight style of dice rolling and modifier cards. You have to accept and even enjoy moments of crushing thematic defeat. What compels you to play is the theme and "dammit I want to win this".[/b]

One of my top 5 favorite games.  I love all the mechanics to this game in additional to its simplicity.  Unlike its counterpart, Arkham Horror, the rules are very streamlined and simple to follow. Its very easy to have one person running the game, while allowing all players to make their own decisions.  The Character progression is one of my favorite aspects, it almost feels like a quick RPG of sorts with the item and spell collection in addition to the stat upgrades.  Finally the short stories on the encounter cards do wonders for the theme of the game and keeps most players interested throughout.

An ok game that suffers from the same problem as all pure cooperative games. It might not be fun for some players because they might not decide anything on their own. And if they do and that is suboptimal the other players might not be pleased because it ruins all the plans for everything. Basically everyone agrees to that is the best move for each player. If playing with an experienced player (and others are not that experienced) that player must either hold himself back, or he will decide everything all the other players do all game.

Alex owns. Some of the best boardgaming moments of my adult life. A game that does everything in its power to destroy you and you get to smash your face into it with friends over and over until you -- just barely -- crawl bloodied and beaten into victory. Overall, the experience this game provides makes it a classic.

RATING: N/A
After two plays my rating is still pending, but I bet it will be as high as Arkham Horror.

Pros:
-The story element is a little more cohesive than in AH. This thanks to the clue and GOO specific cards.

- The characters are more personalized out of the box.

- Different backs to many boons, items etc brings more randomness and fluff.

Cons:
-The setting does not really do it for me. Sure, Antarctica, Arkham, London and Istanbul are cool places to visit, 
but regardless what the rpg fanatics tell you, Lovecraftian horror was born and bred in New England and there's
where I feel it should take place.

- You really don't do anything that much different from an experience in AH.

There is no way that I would delve into another monstrous expansion line as the two base games are as similar as they are now.
I do enjoy EH and love the experiences equally but as none of the pros listed above can not be remedied in AH in some way, I
presently don't see any reason to buy it.
I eagerly await the expansions though.

Streamlined version of Arkham Horror. Still takes forever and a day to finish.

Also, playing with a large group is a bad idea. Especially when your turns are along the lines of "Well, I'm standing on a Clue, full health, full sanity, may as well pass and wait for the encounter phase".

It should have been called Eldritch Snorer.

„Eldritch Horror: Przedwieczna groza”, czyli w 80 szaleństw dookoła świata.
Plusy:
1.	Oprawa graficzna.
2.	Solidne komponenty.
3.	Mechanika.
4.	Proste zasady.
5.	Klimat.
6.	Regrywalność.
7.	Przestronna plansza.
8.	Fabuła.

Minusy:
1.	Mała ilość kart spotkań i brak kilku rzeczy w podstawowej wersji.

„Eldritch Horror: Przedwieczna groza” to dobrze znana gra, której fabuła osadzona jest w świecie stworzonym przez H. P. Lovecrata. W pudle znajdziemy dużą planszę, na której nie będziemy mieć problemu z ciasnotą, a ilość talii kart uszczupli nam jeszcze bardziej miejsce na stole. Z racji tego, iż jest wszystkiego sporo, czas przygotowania gry jest odpowiednio długi. Polecam zaopatrzyć się w insert albo w kufer na grę. Przyśpiesza to przygotowanie i porządkuje żetony. Instrukcja opisuje zasady bardzo dobrze, a wszelkie wątpliwości powinien rozwiać almanach. Jeśli ktoś miał styczność z „Horrorem w Arkham” i/lub „ Znakiem Starszych Bogów” szybko przyswoi zasady Eldritcha. Rozgrywka, mimo iż trochę trwa to się nie dłuży. Historia, którą poznajmy wciąga i tworzy spójną całość. Dwie akcje do wykonania w turze to pozornie niewiele, ale sprawdza się to bardzo dobrze. Po wykonaniu dwóch akcji przystępujemy do fazy spotkań, i to właśnie teraz tworzy się historia i przygoda. Walka z przeciwnikami, sytuacje, które spotykają nas w każdym zakątku globu to właśnie to, co pochłania nas bez reszty. Nigdy nie wiemy, co nas może spotkać, czy coś będzie próbować nas zabić, a może pojawi się ktoś, kto wyciągnie do nas pomocną dłoń? Wszystkie te niewiadome i losowość w rozpatrywaniu testów i innych zdarzeń powoduje, że ciągle czujemy napięcie, a emocje mogą przechodzić ze skrajności w skrajność. W podstawowej wersji gry ilość kart spotkań jest mała i zmusza to do dokupienia dodatku „Zaginiona wiedza”. Brak kilku rozwiązań, które są znane z AH i ZSB też są wprowadzane przez kolejne dodatki. Pomijając braki ilościowe w podstawce to „Eldritch Horror” jest świetnym tytułem. Polecam każdemu, kto lubi twórczość Lovecraft. Moja ocena podstawki to 8/10.

So far Im enjoying the game and have yet to see many of the problems others have mentioned.

I have to disagree when people say it is too random, I find it more varied in routes to success than AH so you can;t just do the same thing each time, ie close the gates or tool up. 
It has much more of a modern feel to it with less clutter although it's still a token fest at times.

cant express how much i hate this game... the setup feels like a tedious job... bothersome and clunky. the gameplay is too dependant on dice rolls.. shitty and draggy game. and it feels like i am reading a draggy novel. i could have play so many other fun games (town center,gates of loyang) using the time i spend to setup this stupid over-hyped game... stupid stupid ! too bad , i cant give zero for this piece of crap. i have seen better stuff in my toilet bowl. A game worse than monopoly... I rather play monopoly than this junk ! in fact , it is so bad , that i stop watching tom vasel review after he said he think this game is great.... yuck !! if you are searching for the reason why ameritrash is named ameritrash...search no more !  

someone just get this piece of shit out of my collection so i can rid myself of this piece of fucking bloody waste of card boards and chips.

Eldritch Horror is an okay co-op, but it feels like success or failure is too dependent on the die rolls. Of course, I probably say that because my last and only session of the game was completely routed by a string of ridiculous failures, including three failures each at 7/8 odds or better. It was ridiculous. I'd be more willing to see whether my opinion is merely marred by failure, if it weren't also for the ridiculous game length.

Also, it's very thematic and I can definitely see myself getting tired of it after five or six plays, assuming I even get that far. Theme just doesn't last for me if the mechanics aren't interesting.

Setup is a chore, the game has a flair that is hard to describe however the positives aside, the game is completely ruled by randomness.   

Your choices do matter however expect great decisions and planning to be utter let downs as you are tossed a curve ball by a random mythos/event/bad die results.

You really do get the vibe of travelling the world over trying to stop eminent doom however after a few play throughs, the game loses that luster that was experienced the first few times a card text was read and everything felt fresh.

Winning the game is challenging and satisfying with a hint of ... "I'm glad it's finally over so I can clean it up and do something else now."

Actually had the most fun playing solo...

A smoother version than Arkham Horror while retaining all the flavor. The game drips flavor and theme while pressing on the team the whole time. Lots to like here and made better with the extra cards from the expansion. The thing that really works for me is that when gathering clues, they are all thematically related directly to your GOO. The other stuff that happens is somewhat random, but is still Lovecraftian and works as an overall story.

One of the few co-ops I like since it doesn't feel like one personality take over and owns the game. More it feels like a each person is going through their own narrative as part of a larger story. It just works really well.

I really wanted to like this game and bought a few of the expansions, but after several plays, I just cannot get into it. There are several innovative game play mechanics for a board game. However there is so much luck and randomness that with a few bad dice rolls, it is easy to fall behind and never be able to catch up. From that point the game becomes an exercise in frustration. I even tried tweaking the game to make it easier, but it just seemed to be just as tedious. There are many little rule bits and exceptions on every game piece which can be easily over looked when it comes to utilized them. Unfortunately I will probably wind up selling EH. Another reviewer mentioned that if you want a real Lovecraft narrative game, play a one of the several Cthulhu RPGs that are out there. I would have to agree.

A refinement but not necessarily an improvement of Arkham Horror.  I prefer the older brother, though that could be nostalgia talking...

Some aspects are streamlined and much easier to use, but I did find the reckoning phase to be a fiddly pain in the butt.  We also ended up reading the same cards several times more than once in a single game.  Arkham Horror is bloated, admittedly, but I love the breadth it provides.

RATING: 3
This game relies just way too much on the outcome of your dice rolls. There are no meaningful decisions at all. Everything is decided by roll of the dice and by roll of the dice alone. The main reason for me to get rid of Arkham Horror was that it was too long. The last session took 7 hours. Now Eldritch Horror lasted for about 4 hours including rules explanation. For what you get out of the game this is just not streamlined enough for me. 4 hours of this is 2 hours too long, especially when considering the (lack of)game mechanic(s). We were never in danger of not defeating the ancient one and the least a cooperative game should achieve is to create a feeling of suspense and turn angst. That's why the theme just doesn't shine as much as in the other games of FFG playing in the Lovecraft world.
I appreciate the effort to include further uncertainties by means of conditions but after one game you basically know what to expect,so there won't be much of a surprise here either. To sum it up: This was a major disappointment.

Quite a good game, thought very long with 8.  The demo game we played was tons of fun.  I am concerned about the replayability.  We saw many of the same events in our game - which we won.  solving 3 mysteries takes a LONG time.  Not sure how the mythos cards affect a 2 or 3 player game.

RATING: 8
While this isn't usually my type of game, it's a pretty fun experience. Much, much better than Arkham Horror. While it fixes a lot of problems with Arkham, my favorite addition is the mystery decks. Now you have to meet certain boss-specific goals each game instead of just trying to do the same thing over and over.

Unfortunately you're still at the mercy of the dice and cards, and the difficulty seems really high. If certain monsters or events come out early, it seems like you can realize that you won't have a chance to win.

Still, lots of variety (different great old ones, investigators, location decks) and the usual great FFG production values help make for a fun time.

Eldritch Horror is a big improvement over Arkham Horror. It removes a lot of fiddly junk from Arkham like the skill sliders, monster movement, monster limits, and money. I like that the Ancient One you choose impacts the game beyond just its character sheet. That said, I still don't think the game is fantastic; it's just a lot better than its predecessor. We did get a lot of laughs out of the sheer ridiculousness of some of the encounter cards.

This is my probably my #1 favorite board game. Fantastic replayability, awesome gameplay, great story. The game can be a game night dominator, though. Be prepared for a lengthy game, but one you will enjoy (hopefully) whether you are victorious or not. Even better with an appropriate soundtrack!


I highly recommend purchasing extra dice for this game.

Love this game! Lots of theme and story. Love the character progression in getting items and solving mysteries. 
Only issue is that it feels a bit restricting to having to do certain things, and doesnt allow for as much 'exploration' as I would like.

RATING: 9
Very good game, after playing other Cthulhu based games (I am thinking mainly Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness) this is the best one for me by far. It feels complex yet simple in its mechanics, smooth rather than abstruse. It doesn't take 2+ hours to learn, it has given us many hours of fun, good replayability with different characters and ancient ones... although I have to admit we have played against the same monster only once or twice til we beat it then we go for the next... and since we have so many expansions, we don't feel like we are repeating the game (even if with the same Ancient One it can change drastically depending on your luck, the objects you draw, etc). On the downside, indeed the luck plays a huge factor in this game... you are rolling dice for everything and you can end up very frustrated with how that turns out for you... you can do either nothing, okay, or very very good depending on how your rolls go.

This is a very interesting big box cooperative game and it seems tone one of the best of them out there! It can be incredibly immersive if you allow the theme to take you in and it will provide an enriching experience! Of course this game is not for everyone if you do not like the Cthulhu investigation theme then you should probably not get this! Also if you do not like hard games that overwhelm you easily then you should avoid this!

Components 9/10 (The standees are falling apart a little bit but thats possibly my fault)
Gameplay 9/10 (The game is very well designed and streamlined but there are a few points that I believe could use extra clarification)
Theme 10/10 (what can I say I love Cthulhu)

Overall (9/10) I love this game and I just wish I had more of it!!!

Damn, this game is LONG.  Or at least it felt that way.  Which is not really a bad thing, but sometimes I feel like these types of "experience games" run the risk of distorting the golden ratio of "meaningful choices vs. playtime," by which I mean about halfway through I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over in terms of trying to affect the game, with samey dice rolls mixed in with some point-to-point movement.  I dunno, probably should try it again before passing anymore unfounded judgment :)

There's no way to not compare Eldritch to Arkham Horror:
1) Eldritch's worldwide scale makes way more sense than every misfortune in the universe happening in one small backwater town.
2) Eldritch is faster to set up and play (though not by much)
3) Eldritch is streamlined, but [b]not[/b] dumbed down
4) Having to solve mysteries instead of closing/sealing gates makes fighting different GOOs be a really different experience
5) The mysteries and clue encounters being keyed to specific GOOs makes the story told by Eldritch far, far more cohesive than that told by Arkham.

RATING: 5
Low rating is mainly for how incomplete the game feels without an expansion. Hard to feel involved when cycling through a deck and getting multiples of an encounter during one playthrough. Should have included Forsaken Lore in the base box and the game becomes a much more enjoyable experience with the first expansion.

RATING: 5
The first three rounds of Eldritch Horror I played somewhat conditioned me against it. On round 1 I moved to a city and took a city event. A cult offered me a mighty demon slaying sword for the price of paying back this debt some time in the future. On round 2 took another city event and went to jail and lost the sword. On round 3 I rolled good and got out of jail. Three rounds of nothing with really long downtimes in between as we played a six player game. Also, the cult came later, I rolled good again and nothing bad happened. Another round of nothing. This dragged for about six hours. I can't find the adventure in this one.

RATING: 8
Love it and hate it!  The game can really drag on (I would set the max player count at 4) and it needs some house rules so it's not so ridiculously hard, but it's tough to find a more epic adventure in board game form.

RATING: 6.75
Pretty good tactical co-op, though I don't like the characters being specialized and checks being totally random. I never felt like a check is trivial, but I did occasionally feel like a check was impossible (and I never knew what sort of a check an action would entail).

I did occasionally feel I did not really have much of a purpose to the group and was just doing monster/gate cleanup.

Wow, what a ride! A true adventure each time this game is played, and the sense of hopelessness that should accompany a Lovecraft game is palpable. The world is falling apart, and you are it's only slim hope. Yes, the game is full of random chance, but that is how the incredible stories are made! My wife loves a game with lots of narrative, so this one is a hit with her as well.

I like how each of the Ancient Ones have their own unique mysteries that the investigators need to solve. The double-sided cards are interesting too.

Overall though, I prefer Arkham Horror. While streamlining a game might make it more appealing to the average gamer, it takes away its depth as well.

I never mind complexity in a game, so long as I feel the complexity adds something valuable to the experience. The amount of time a game takes is also never an issue for me. If I'm going to spend four hours playing game(s), I'd have more fun playing my favorite four-hour game, than multiple shorter games.

There are two reasons why someone might like Arkham Horror. They'll either like the theme of running around, solving mysteries and closing gates, while Lovecraftian monsters awaken, or they'll like the immersive engine, that is the mechanics and flow of the game. I like both but I prefer the latter. Someone who likes only the former might see Arkham Horror's mechanics as getting in the way of their Lovecraftian fun, and see Eldritch Horror as being everything they like about Arkham Horror, without the things they disliked. For someone like me though, Eldritch Horror, while having the theme of my favorite game, has taken away basically everything that makes Arkham Horror my favorite game.

You also go through the cards very quickly, with just the Eldritch Horror base game. After a couple of games, they start to get old. Even during the first game I played, some of the debt cards got old as we drew them multiple times, though to be fair, it was a six-player game, and we were all taking on a lot of debt. With Arkham Horror, I've played it countless times, including 10+ times with just the base game, and I still haven't seen all of the base game encounter cards. Despite owning all of the Arkham Horror expansions, I will still happily go back and play vanilla Arkham Horror from time-to-time. Now that I have an expansion for Eldritch Horror, I don't want to ever go back, to the base game. It feels like it was designed to give you the bare minimum required to play, to remain affordable, and if you want to continue to enjoy it, you'd need to get the Forsaken Lore expansion.

I give Eldritch Horror a 2/10, or 6/10 with the Forsaken Lore expansion, which fixes the cards-getting-old problem. With a side-board expansion in addition to Forsaken Lore, it's around 7/10.

[b]General[/b]
Well, I must start by saying that [thing=146021][/thing] is quite different from [thing=15987][/thing] in its mechanics. [thing=146021][/thing] seems to be an easier game to learn and teach, because there isn't issues envolving money (the purchase of items and the acquision of allies is all made through tests of Influence, and you acquire one or more of the shown cards up to the amount of successes rolled), nor there is things regarding injuries or madness (there are fixed effects, unique to the characters, and these informations are on the back of the characters sheet), or even special effects of locations (but the locations in [thing=146021][/thing] have different types of encounters, depending on what it is: city, wild or sea). Also, there is no more an upkeep phase - the attributes of the investigators are fixed (though they can go up with training) and the cards that require tests (such as blessings, curses, and other conditions) occur when a Mythos card activates them.

[b]Action[/b]
The round start with the actions phase in which each investigators has two to make, and they can't be the same. The actions are: travel (go to an adjacent place); prepare (in the next round the investigator will be able to travel to a local two spots away, by acquiring a train ticket or a ship ticket); rest (recover 1 stamina and 1 sanity); acquiring resources (by rolling Influence); and trade (if two investigators are in the same place).

[b]Encounters[/b]
In this phase the investigators battle monsters if there is one or more of them in the same place he/she is. If the place is free of monsters, the investigator can have an encounter there. There are several types of encounters and the player chooses (if there is more than one option) which to take effect. The types are: neutral (can happen anywhere in the board); local (for the named places, like: Arkham, Rome, Tokyo, and others); clue (can only happen in a place where a clue is); expedition (can only happen where the expedition marker is); rumor (if there is a rumor in place, the investigators can have an encounter in the active location of the rumor); and gate (if, in the place, there is an open gate).

Notice that, in [thing=146021][/thing], the Other World encounters (the gate encounters), now happen in the same phase as the others, not after - it only matters, now, the turn order, not which type of encounter is chosen. By the way, the gate encounters are solved all in one go (so, it isn't necessary anymore to pass for, usually, two Other World encounters in order to seal a gate), and the requirement for 5 clue tokens is no longer in place (though, sometimes, you will have to spend clues, but in a different fashion, normally to fulfill demands of the Mystery cards), and no place in the board is sealed - so the gates can always keep coming.

[b]Mythos[/b]
Unlike [thing=15987][/thing], in [thing=146021][/thing] there is a limited number of Mythos cards: the deck is made accordingly with the numbers written in the Ancient One sheet. The Mythos deck is, therefore, one of the time markes of the game - in case it is depleted, the game ends in defeat for the investigators - and this solves one of the issues many have with [thing=15987][/thing]: that the play can drag on, with none of the sides with much to do (the Ancient One has a tough time awake due to many seals in the board, and the investigators cannot acquire clues to seal one more - but are armed enough to kill the monsters, so the Terror track doesn't rise).

The Mythos card in [thing=146021][/thing] also works differently: no more indication as to where a gate will open, nor which type of monsters will move, or have different key types (except Rumor; so Environments and Headlines are out). In [thing=146021][/thing] the informations that can be in a Mythos card are:
- advance of the Omen, which will indicate which type of portal will be activated and, thus, how much will advance the Doom track;
- resolve reckoning effects (the red symbol that some monsters and cards have);
- spawn gates (a number of gates shown on the card open; every gate shows where in the board it will go). If there is no more gates to open, the Doom track advances;
- spawn monsters (one for each gate that opened);
- spawn clues (the number of clues on the Mythos cards are placed in the board - each clue shows where it must be placed);
- if the Mythos is a Rumor card, is activates a place in the board, and markers are put on it (this will show the time the investigators have to solve the Rumor - if they didn't, the game ends in defeat for the investigators).

[b]Tests[/b]
As I mentioned, there isn't anymore, like there is in [thing=15987][/thing], an upkeep phase to adjust stats. All the tests, now, are based in fixed stats - you just roll the number of dice equal to the number (modified by cards and other things, [u]but always rolling a minimum of one die[/u]). It is possible to improve the stats due to encounters or other effects. But, even with this, in [thing=146021][/thing] you are more stuck with bad attributes, since in [thing=15987][/thing] you could improve, in the upkeep, the stats of the investigator in order to prepare for something.

[b]Combat[/b]
This isn't much unlike the one in [thing=15987][/thing]: you still make an Horror check followed by an combat test. The differences, however, are several: first, you don't use a limit of "hands" to hold weapons - you can only use one, no matter which it is (so you will never stack the bonuses given by several items), but the benefits given by carried items (like, re-roll one die) can be used together with the weapon used. Also, you only make [u]one[/u] combat test - the creature must be defeated in only one roll, or it will stay in the place it is, and you will need to face it again in the next round if you want to defeated it - but the damage given stay in the monster.

Also, the monsters give sanity and stamina damage in a different way: you have an amount of successes to reach, for Horror and Combat. If you don't reach the amount shown, the investigator will receive, as damage, the difference. So say the investigator is facing a monster with -1 Determination and 3 Sanity; -1 Strenght and 3 Stamina. You roll 2 success for the Horror check, so 1 bellow the number of Sanity given, therefore, the monster will do 1 sanity damage. Then, again 2 success for the Combat check. The monster will receive 2 points of damage, will give 1 point of stamina damage to the investigator, and won't be defeated. The combat ends.

If there are more than 1 monster in a location, the investigator, after beating one monster, can fight another, and so on, until the investigator fails to defeat a monster or killed all of them. Finally, the monsters aren't taken as trophies anymore (since there isn't location to spend them), so all return to the pool of monsters when beaten (this do not apply to the epic creatures, because to them apply special rules).

[b]Spells and Conditions[/b]
One of the coolest things in [thing=146021][/thing] are the spells and Conditions, because these two types of cards have hidden information on their backs, and these informations can only be consulted when the investigator tries to cast the spell or when an specific situation happens (in the case of the Conditions cards). So, when this happens, you turn over the card to see what will occur. It is important to say that this mechanic isn't new: it was done somewhat similar in [thing=83330][/thing] for the spells, but, regardless of being innovative or not, I most certainly liked to see it applied here, since it is such an easy way to produce some tension and suspense into the gameplay.

By the way, the Conditions cards basically replace all that, in [thing=15987][/thing], were different things, like: Madness, Wounds, Loans, Blessings, Curses, and others. All the Conditions cards have two informations described in its front: a case in which you will lose the Condition, and a check you will make when the Mythos activate the Reckoning symbols (the red symbol). Again, an elegant decision, turning several types of decks in only one, more embracing.

[b]Leadership[/b]
In [thing=146021][/thing] the turn order is only fixed in a clockwise fashion after is decided which player will the the "leader" of the round - this player will be the first in the round. This way the players have more control over the game situation and also it inforces debate between players regarding what each of them will do in the round. Therefore is easier to react to changes in the game status and to act in a more cohesive way. Again, this isn't something new (for instance, the turn order in [thing=128445][/thing] is all decided by the players, it is not even clockwise after the first to go), but I do like more this way: it allows for some though situations (since the order isn't completely free to decide), thus putting some pressure in the players, while also allows to some degree of control.

[b]Winning and Losing[/b]
The investigators win when:
- all the 3 Mysteries are solved;
- fulfilling the conditions written in the back of the Ancient One sheet once it awakes.

The investigators lose when:
- the Ancient One awakes (accordingly with the rules in the back of the sheet);
- all the investigators are devoured (only a danger in the final battle);
- the effect of a card causes the end of the game (usually when a Rumor isn't solved in time);
- is necessarry to draw a Mythos card and there is none more to be drawn.

[b]Components e variety[/b]
As usual, the components from a Fantasy Flight game are great. Also, que quality of the art in every card and piece of cardboard is top notch - though, as it has become the norm, some of the art was taken from other games (why pay for the art and only use it once, right?).

The initial worry regarding the quality of the gameplay turned, once it was out, into another: does the game has enough replay value built on it? Yes, the game comes with a lot of cards and tokens, but, in some of my plays, all the clue encounters were used (but, since the encounters cards, like the ones in [thing=15987][/thing], are divided in three, don't take the "used all the encounter cards" as have read all of all of them). Encounters in some of the regions were also pretty close to end. But this isn't something new: since the base game of [thing=15987][/thing], as it came with only 8 encounters cards per region. Eight! I can't even count so high as the number of times that Carl Sanford asked me to join the Order (but surely it was enough for me to think that every citizen in Arkham was a member, some more than once). However, once the expansions were added, I now have decks of around 30 cards for each region. The initial worry was folly and I stopped shuffling the encounters after each encounter long ago. And there is no doubt in my mind that [thing=146021][/thing] will follow suit.

This is not only because there is already one expansion for the game. [thing=154842][/thing] was out pretty soon, probably to answer the more emphatic of the complaints. It comes with over 230 cards (to put in perspective, the base game comes with 303 cards). Therefore, as sure as the sun will come up and the Ancients Ones sleep, will come more expansions (and one more was already announced: [thing=164167][/thing]).

Now, in a more direct parallel: [thing=146021][/thing] comes with 12 investigators and 4 Ancient Ones. [thing=15987][/thing] comes with 16 investigators and 8 Ancient Ones. In the case of the investigators there is no argument: it is less, and it could have come with the same 16. But, regarding the Ancient Ones, not so much. Mainly because, in [thing=15987][/thing] you face the Ancient One always in the same way, suffering the same effects. In [thing=146021][/thing], the Mysteries to be solved can vary, not only in the order they might show up, but also for which will. So is indeed possible to face the same Ancient One in different ways. Besides this, each Ancient One has its own associated deck - the Clues encounters, to make the game more sound thematic. Also, the way to build the Mythos deck is different for each AO. With all this in mind, it is clear that is more harder to make an Ancient One in [thing=146021][/thing] (which explains the smaller number of them), while also allows for them to have a greater replay value, being more variable in themselves.

So, to sum it up, in the matter of replay value, I didn't feel "robbed". But one must have in mind the game is built to receive expansions (and, who knows, one day, an expansion for its expansions - I have seen it!). If you want a one-purchase-and-done type of game, well, avoid [thing=146021][/thing].

[b]Better? Worst?[/b]
Is [thing=146021][/thing] better or worst then [thing=15987][/thing]? At this point I can't say, not to one side and not to the other. They are way too different, having as major connections points the theme and the full cooperation. But since in size, duration and scope, they are closer than both are with [thing=100423][/thing], comparisons are inevitable. So here they go.

[thing=146021][/thing] seemed the easier game to learn and to teach, whithout as many cases of exceptions and little rules that are present in [thing=15987][/thing]. The duration of the plays also appeared to be shorter (though not short): from around 4 hours to around 3.

In [thing=146021][/thing] the monster don't block movement, so it is easier to go where you want, and even if a player takes the role of "monster killer" he will have a good deal of encounters, while, in [thing=15987][/thing], combat will more often than not means that your investigator will be on the street and won't have an encounter to make. The "passable" monsters, also help player to not "lose" a turn, staying in the same location for one or more turns, because one damned monster just won't move. Also, without Other World encounters, no more Lost in Time and Space (and I can't see this as a bad thing).

Besides, in [thing=146021][/thing] the goals of the game can vary accordingly to the Mysteries, so you not always will be after clues and sealing gates (though, both of this things still play a big role. So the players will do different things in different plays, more so than what happens in [thing=15987][/thing].

The downtime in [thing=146021][/thing] is similar to the one in [thing=15987][/thing]. And it feels as if the one in [thing=146021][/thing] is bigger since you do your whole encounter at once. The point in favor of [thing=146021][/thing] is that, since the investigator only has one combat check against any monster, fighting multiple monsters don't take nearly as long.

So, overall, pondering about the points above, [thing=146021][/thing] sounds like the better game, being without as many rough edges and also managing to have more theme in the flow of the game (but I much prefer the Allies from [thing=15987][/thing]). And this may well be truth. However, what seem like negative points for [thing=15987][/thing], don't bother me in the least - maybe because I got used to them, but most likely because I still have loads of fun playing it. So I can't properly be objective about this matter.

Anyway, [thing=146021][/thing] comes from a solid base, and the team of designers from Fantasy Flight knew how to work on the complaints and opinions received during the 8 years of [thing=15987][/thing] in order to create something mostly new, that has several merits. It already made a big splash among players (though, I don't think it will have the same level of success that [thing=15987][/thing] had and still have, but will surely be enough to sustain a steady line, with new material coming in a regular basis - and not the full abandonment that hit some of others great games from FF, ahem, [thing=31563][/thing], ahem, [thing=42776][/thing]).

So, I recommend [thing=146021][/thing], and this goes from a huge [thing=15987][/thing] fan. And yes, I do believe that there is room for both in the same collection. Though, if you are just now entering the this whole Mythos co-op thing, I guess [thing=146021][/thing] will be a better choice, since it is fairly new and will get way more attention in the years to come.

A meaty adventure game that's less about monsters than it is about getting to the right place and rolling dice to say whether you succeeded in your challenge. Yes, sometimes those challenges are monsters, but win or lose you'll have a good story to tell when it's over.

I've only played this 3 or 4 times so maybe I just never got the hang of it. Feels too hard to have this level of randomness in it. I feel like my decision making wasn't rewarded. Flavour, design and theme are the winners here. A wonderful feeling game that forgot to make the game good.

Initial play...liked arkham better, took out some cool mechanics that arkham has.  I need to play again and update it...yet I really don't have a desire yet.  Got this game to hopefully replace a couple of the clunkiness of arkham horror.  (moving the monsters is a pain, and the environment cards are a pain to keep track of, so sometimes I don't even play with them.)  So after a while, I played this game again and it seemed to play much better, so I upped my rating a little bit.  I still like arkham, but liked this one now to maybe as much.  A few more plays and I will update again.

Really like this game, it is very thematic. Each play through is a new story that unfolds while you try to stop the Elder God's from destroying the world. Set-up takes a while, with all the cards, especially when you add in expansions, but is a challenging, fun experience that makes the longer set up well worth it

Long game with too much text. Game system body slams you down on the concrete and then while your down, keeps kicking your head. Mercy. Three hours of mindless torture.  There is certainly better games out there I would rather play.

RATING: 6
A long game that is full of terrors.  Does not scale up well past 3-4 players.  The main reason for this is that turns are functionally imbalanced and can be long or almost nothing.  Perhaps more streamlined and better implemented than Arkham Horror, yet it does not feel as original.  Because Eldritch Horror is on a global scale does not have a  design that is as cramped and phobic as its predecessor.

Finally got round to playing this at UKGE14 and loved it. Have never subscribed to the feeling that Arkham Horror was broken in some way, but this addition to the franchise does succeed in making the struggle against the Mean & Grebblies a truly globe trotting story telling experience. Going back to visit the grave of a fallen investigator a few turns later was actually a moving moment, not something common in boardgames. I liked the combat and gate system in this and thought it moved along smoothly and swiftly without feeling like you were just 'letting the game happen'

Cooperativo muy divertido y tenso aunque también un poco largo. Por regla general me gustan más los juegos de entre 1 y 2 horas y con este puedes irte hasta las 3 horas. La parte narrativa esta muy conseguida y te hace meterte en una aventura. Aunque al final se acaban repitiendo las historias y casi se va directamente a la parte que te indica la prueba que debes hacer. El juego es complicado de ganar pero las veces que hemos perdido hemos sentido que hemos estado a punto de alcanzar nuestro objetivo y eso ha hecho que nos haya parecido aún más divertido

Another Lovecraftian dabble from FFG. A bit more streamlined and smoother game play than in Arkham Horror and definitely better feel and atmosphere than in the ever rolling Elder Sign. Nothing wrong with it, a definite for Lovecraft fan, great co-opish for anyone into 20's horror and best FFG/Lovecraftian approach for those looking for a game instead of a way to kill a long evening.

The best Mythos game to date. 
Eldritch Horror is the next-gen Arkham Horror and, with its streamlined play and awesome story mechanics, totally fires the old game.
Even with all the customisation I've done over the years on AH (and all the money I've spent), I can't see myself ever playing it again unless as a nostalgia kick.  
If you decide to shell-out for EH though, grab a copy of the Forbidden Lore expansion at the same time.  My only complaint with the core set is that the location decks are a little slim.  Even in a single play you'll probably see encounters repeated.  Forbidden Lore almost doubles the decks and adds a heap of replayability.

Game length, card text and coop are not favored in my gamegroup, so this is a solo game for me. Still, great fun. Often the game feels too brutal, as a wrong set of mythos cards can simply leave you chanceless. Couldn't they have balanced these just a little more? Normally, I'm not a big fan of expansions, but I can understand it for a game like this. Will I shell out for more investigators? I don't know yet...

I own AH from 2008, it is an excellent game but in all this years i was able to put it on the table only 2 times!

After reading some reviews and viewing some videos i buyed EH. I think this is the best buy of the year! This game is how AH should be; very playable, fast set up and putting down. A fantastic thematic and immersive game that tells a story every time you play it. Plays really well and it is fun even in solo. 
Why is not a 10? I think it deserves 30% more of all encounters and mythos cards!
I just can't wait for expansions!

Edit 12-28-2013 after a 5 players game Vs Cthulhu started 12-27 at 10.30 PM ended 12-28 at 2.30 AM; played with people who Hated AH. These friends liked it a lot even if playing against Cthulhu in the first game is a tough job! This game deserves a 10! Maybe after expansions will be an 11 or 12!

+ Good game with good replayability in the box. Good flavor text, good design, good theme, good depth of gameplay (yes, there is some).

- Boring with small player counts.
- Too long with higher player counts.
- Sometimes stories make no cense (Politician robbing the shop, what?)
- The card which cause you to undo one mystery - bad design, Makes a very long game even longer.
- Different Elder Ones feels not that different.
- Sometimes you can't accomplish anything due to bad dice rolls or you just not in the center of events and then game feels flat. Especially if you need to collect clue and dice are not in your favor, but you can't move somewhere else because you need that clue :)

Probably my favorite game. Fun co-op that isn't TOO complicated and fiddly unlike Arkham Horror, with nice materials and a lovecraftian theme, and it's challenging enough to require team effort in order to win. Wish there was a change of difficulty between an odd and even number of players though. 

The game length is perfect for 4 players, 6-8 players can take hours and hours. However, it also makes a very fun solo game, and is quite challenging if you just use one investigator. For any new owner who reads this review, I firmly suggest not using the "All for nothing" mythos card for it will lead to a bunch of frustrated players.

I really like the idea of a co-operative game! Not only is it fun not to play against each other (well, that's actually also fun, but...), but it's also awesome to be able to play this game solo!

The idea of having an Ancient One and resolving mysteries to win the game makes the game so interesting, keeping the players constantly on their toes! The horror theme really gets you into the game, and allows you to be immersed in the world, role playing the characters! :P

The only thing that, I think, could be worked on, is probably the need to actually move towards and work on expeditions. Having only the base game, currently, I find no need to go for the expedition unless there is nothing better to do. This is especially true when the token is in some remote place (*ahem*antartica*ahem*). 

Overall, though, one of the best 'RPG'-like games I've played. :) Also, with the amount of things added from the array of expansions - one of the games with super engaging replayability.

Si se dan las circunstancias, la sensación de vivir una aventura completa, sea o no el final feliz, está realmente conseguida.

Complicated, but really fun if you're lucky. Main two problems are that some of the goals are clearly much harder than the others, so if you start off having to seal portals, expect to lose.

We had chance to play a Lovecraft-lite game of 'Eldritch Horror' last night, which is essentially very similar to 'Arkham Horror' with a few less mechanics.

It sets the investigators against the same range of Outer Gods - we faced Azazoth, Ruler of Them All  - and we had to traverse the world rather than wondering the streets of Arkham alone.

I prefer this setting theme than Arkham alone. As with many Fantasy Flight Games, there are lots of cards for allies, artifacts, spells and weapons, with pre-set encounter cards.

This gives the game a lot of re-play value as no two games will ever be alike. The key is to choose a good range of investigators so we had a martial artist, the musician, a psychic, the soldier and one other.

We managed to prevent too many gates opening, and were very lucky on completing the three part investigation, before Azazoth awoke and wreaked havoc from beyond the stars.

There was only one casualty - my psychic, who lost her last remaining health point when the stars turned dark and she fell in Istanbul having healed her peers. A sad day. Boo hoo.

Variety in GOO you can pick.  

The game has moments of randomness, where checks are determined by dice rolls, and if you roll badly then you can end up losing the game even if you have good strategy.

None the less the entire package seems like a adventure and ride till the end.

Streamlined Arkham Horror, which is a good thing. Same narrative fun, less checking pointless rules in the rulebook. Win - win.

The theme is strong and consistent, and play moves along fast enough despite a long playtime.  Nevertheless, can be (and seems almost intentionally) frustratingly random; deaths and other losses sometimes feel arbitrary. "Thor-and-skippy" co-op group dynamics can rob some players of the feeling of agency, especially if they come to possess the critical MacGuffin needed to defeat the big bad.  Huge difficulty swings from one objective to another ("Mysteries") that are luck-of-the-draw; requires multiple plays to understand mechanics and translate how the theme works out into getting plans accomplished.

I was excited to get this game because I loved Arkham Horror so much.

I feel the rule books are difficult to navigate, the game play is choppy and feels like it needed more play testing. (Already has a growing Errata sheet! This is not a polished game.)

They simplified many aspects of Arkham Horror while made many other parts more complicated to the point of boredom. (They actually introduced MORE fiddly rules instead of remove them)

Not suitable for a 2 player game due to movement restrictions.

Fun game, but it won't supplant Arkham Horror for me. It's good, but doesn't give me the RPG lite feel that Arkham does. Eldritch is shorter and does play better than Arkham for one to three players though, so not a bad game to have in tandem with Arkham in the toolbox. All that being said, I need to play it more with multiple players.

Cleaner than Arkham, and just blatantly a better game [i]qua[/i] game. Thematically, EH is much more coherent. AH's best plan of action is to avoid the story elements and abuse the location effects; the more I play to win, the less I like it. EH's clue and mystery mechanisms, and focus on encounters for resolution, make more sense for an adventure game, and don't require you to play in an un-fun, un-thematic way.

The biggest improvement is the game arc. Arkham's was predicated on a fundamentally wrong-headed core design choice with gates, doom, and victory conditions. In EH, you have an organic incentive to close gates (in AH, it was often counter-productive). And no more of the "coast to the finish" of AH (which might take a long time). Also--and this is big--less of the "buff up and fight", which I rarely did because it isn't fun in process or resolution.

Monsters in both AH and EH are tricky. AH had a lot of dumb elements (esp. the Outskirts, an obvious kludge), and the idea of all these things shambling around a small town was ludicrous. EH cleans a lot of that up, and the ability to avoid monsters and still get something done is very welcome (yet you still need to take care of them somehow). Again, player agency over RPG-esque effects; the overarching difference.

The GOO-specific focus in EH makes for [i]much[/i] more coherent stories. In AH, the GOO was often irrelevant (essentially one or two game effects, akin to EH's "ongoing" cards).

AH still offers greater character options, both in terms of setup (skills and variable starting possessions are missed). EH is tighter and more careful about these things, but I do miss some of AH's zaniness and character variability. The characters are more of a resource to manage in EH; having them do their job and then die, and then the new one goes and picks up their stuff, is common. Again, less RPG, more game.

Game length is only slightly improved. Still too many idiotic "lose a turn" effects in both; EH is better on this score, but no idea why those were retained at all.

I also really like the ease of expansion integration. There is no analogue to the "all-in" option with AH, but it's so much cleaner for it. The current approach is sustainable for a long time. And of course this sort of game is fine with house rules.

So, for me, a better experience overall, though I'll still keep and play Arkham as a "special event." But--shockingly--using AH as a starting point and learning some lessons from it, EH is just a blatantly better game.

Finds a place in my collection between Arkham Horror and Elder Scrolls.  Different enough from both to own all both in scope and game play.  The wide area of play takes away some of the theme for me versus AH but the shorter play time is a bonus.  You still need to work together and make tough decisions on your collaboration choices.  Can only be improved with the upcoming expansion.

RATING: 4
I love the theme, but there's just one fundamental issue with this game: there's too much card reading and not enough action. I don't mind a little bit of fluff, but unfortunately the action phase in this game is not interesting at all, players are very limited in what they can do. There's not enough real decision making, everything comes down to "move to another location, wait for the encounter phase, draw a card, read a card, roll some dice and hope for fives or sixes". I wish the game was more focused on the action phase. Unfortunately, it's very heavy on the encounter phase and by that it feels very "automatic". I'm sure some players will find this interesting, but I prefer cooperative games that offer more interesting choices (like Robinson Crusoe). 

Also, I was disappointed that the narrative in Eldritch Horror consists of just a bunch of unrelated events - I hoped for a more cohesive storyline (Mice & Mystics did it just right in terms of storytelling).

Still, I'm glad I tried it, at least I know that pure ameritrash cooperative games aren't really for me. No theme-heavy board game will ever be as immersive as good old RPGs. Do yourself a favour and find a good game master and try one of the Cthulhu universe-based RPG systems, you won't regret it.

8/10 after 1st session and the same rating after another one. With some chances to be even 9/10 when played together with expansions which (I guess) addds more 'Mystery', 'Mythos' and 'Encounter' cards. In my opinion it would be good if these cards would give player some choices (generally, several kinds of impact to player(s)) more often than standard "test x ability", "test y ability" etc.

You can think of this game as a compact, 90-minute version of the whole 12 sessions of Pandemic Legacy. I love the fact that there's a strong sense of character growth within a session. The story-telling aspect of the game is also amazing if you immerse yourself into it.

30/11/14: Secret Santa Gift, 2013: No matter what they say, this is FFG's Arkham Horror version 2; but it is, I have to grudgingly admit, better.  Some of what makes Arkham Horror great is lost: the focus on your character, the tactical choices offered by the sliders and the equipment assigned to your hands, and the bonkers final battles with the GOO.  But so much more is gained: more options on your turn; streamlined play with a stronger narrative focus on the GOO; and a deck of mythos cards that ticks down to a definite end, preventing games from lasting 6+ hours. 02/07/15: But do I like it?  Often whilst playing, I find myself looking forward to the end.  I love the stories it tells--but as a game, it's very dependant on the people you play with.  If they're not in on the joke that is Lovecraft's writing, the game can be tedious.  Too random for real strategy, Eldritch Horror has to be enjoyed for the ride, or avoided.

I really don't like Arkham Horror: the theme does nothing for me and the gameplay is a bore. Eldritch on the other hand is a fantastic and interesting cooperative game with a goal. Along with that goal are interesting characters, experiences, and events that are so much more interesting than Arkham's. The theme is still the same, so that's probably why this isn't rated higher, but I'd still be happy to play this game most days.

I wish I liked this game a bit more than I did. After playing the game only twice, I ran into a lot of the same cards that I had on the first game.

Not sure how to leave my comment on this Arkham Horror variant. I've read a lot of Cthulhu stories and love the theme.  The problem is that I (and my group) feel largely like spectators as the game plays out and what could be a great opportunity for grand and memorable cooperative and heroic teamwork falls short and unsatisfying.  One of these days they will get it and I will buy it.

This is not a bad co-op per sé, but for me, it has absolutely nothing that sets it apart from any other co-op. It's a very generic pandemic-style co-op.
This is a problem for me, because the game can (and will) be dominated by the smartest/most knowledgable/loudest player at the table, and there's no real mechanic to stop that from happening.

Only interesting if you're into H.P. Lovecraft (I'm not).

More loot than Arkham Horror = more fun. Less dice rolling than Arkham but it still relies a bit too much on luck for a longer game. I've seen tactical gamers get a little frustrated with that.

I am definitely not turning in Arkham Horror (which has a 10 rating from me) in favor of Eldritch Horror. I love the new global theme, and the multicultural cast (it is about time) of new investigators and their special powers. What makes me want to keep on the shelf is the lack of variety (which I hope expansions can fix) of encounters. We actually started repeating encounters at one point during the game.  I am also have a complaint about the amount of time it takes to finish a game. I was so bored by the end of hour 5, than we welcomed our devouring just so we could go to bed.  I will need a few more plays before I stick with this rating.

RATING: 7
For years, Arkham Horror was a near-buy for me.  I never took the leap, though, because of the game's length, obsessive mechanics, and messy rulebook.  I was happy to play occasionally under someone else's tutelage, but I had no interest in buying my own copy, struggling with the rules, and teaching it to newcomers.

Eldritch Horror is a cleaner, simpler game - but without being simplistic.  Also, the conditions and other double-sided cards are cool. I'm grateful that I don't have pounds of Arkham clogging my shelves, as EH has plenty of theme and silliness to keep my interest.  And if I only play semi-regularly, I can stick with the small-box expansions to spice things up.

For those who already own Arkham Horror, I can't imagine that you'd want to own both this version and the original.  Eldritch Horror is more of the same, really, in a slightly different form.  I'm not even sure it's any shorter.  But if you're bored and sleeping on piles of cash, I say go for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A beautiful looking game with a curious narrative, you work with your friends to save the world from a mysterious evil.  As great as that sounds, this coop game relies so much on 1/3 success chance dice roll that any good plans will become foiled and the game session will quickly become unbeatable. There is so much downtime watching your friends failing their rolls, while at the same time you're unable to deal with the cruel events that already happened to your character.  The game is the definition of a bad luck simulator.  A good upgrade from Arkham, but this game is still more upsetting than enjoyable.

Like: Creates a Story, sometimes with personality*. Many stand up and cheer moments with the dice. Simple Die resolve system. Gaining Assets. Game is HARD.

Dislike: I am not the biggest fan of the Lovecraft theme. Some of the monsters are crazy powerful and can come out way sooner than you can even consider to deal with them.

Aside: *The first game I played I was the Martial Artist. It turns out the Martial Artist is absolutely horrible with money because she managed to get every debt card in the game....twice.

I shocked how much I like this game. In terms of mechanics, there's nothing much going on here. Choose between a few actions, roll dice and see if you get successes, and go from there. Couple that with a long game, and I was convinced I wouldn't like it that much.

And I was wrong. The storytelling is truly what shines in this game. It just works. I don't know how, but it does. This game is not going to be for everyone, but I sure enjoy it.

Bought at Arkham Nights - Rated it at 9.25, but could increase with more plays.  Arkham Horror is still my only 10 rated game, but this has the potential to join it.

It has enough differences from Arkham to warrant having both.  It has less to keep track of (money is gone, elder signs are gone, most monsters don't move, no skill sliders, items/allies in one pile - not 3)

We'll see how I feel about it with more plays and whatever comes with expansions.  I enjoy it quite a bit so far and seems to move quicker (per turn) than Arkham.

I really enjoy the thematic experience that this game provides. It's nice to spend an evening playing an immersive interactive story. Each expansion improves the re-playability massively due to the extra cards for the encounter decks. 

Closing in on 50 plays and this game has held firm. It improves with all the expansions and is one of our favourite 2 player games. It's just such a good adventure with an emerging narrative.

Based on 1 play while learning the game. Thematic and quicker than AH. Can't wait to play again.

Played again! It gets called to the table a lot. Each game has been a loss, unfortunately. But the stories each game manages to tell make up for all of that.

Crazy hard, amazing theme, perfect game for horror fans. This game was what sent me off the deep end into the board game hobby. Some people will be turned off by the dice rolling, though there are ways to mitigate some of the randomness.  I personally don't mind it at all. 10/10 for me.

Enjoyed our first game even though Cthulu won. More thematic than AH because the clues and victory conditions change depending on the GOO you are fighting. However, AH comes with more variety out of the box. I think an expansion or two will really help this game.

Very thematic coop, although the story bits are almost completely disconnected from the actual gameplay. The luck factor is high, but there's just enough strategy as well to keep it interesting.

Have played five times with one down-to-the-wire win. We actually won on the last turn! That was a good time.

Today we played three games in seven hours and got the beatdown each time. I really don't mind the losing so much, but I dislike the feeling I have of having almost no control over anything that happens. As a Lovecraft fan, I understand that there should not be easy wins in this game. But being constantly slapped down by random events gets pretty old.

Will take a break for awhile and probably give it another try, but I doubt my opinion will change much. If I'm going to play a Lovecraftian game, I would much rather play the RPG.

Worthy successor of Arkham Horror. Very impressed by how they strealined the rules and still retained everything that was exciting about this game. I would however keep the number of players to 4, 5 at the very max, as the game takes ages to proceed if players are not planning their turn in advance.

[b]Eldritch Horror[/b] is the spawn of [i]Arkham Horror[/i] and largely [i]Elder Sign[/i], with a light sprinkling of [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] dust over the top.

The game's strip-mined all the other Cthulhu games for ideas, and is better for it, I think. And some of the systems used here are simple and effective, but given clever theme-inspired bells and whistles. I particularly like the Omen dial, with constellations depicted. The stars truly are right!

Multiple story-driven encounters are fun, and the choice of encounters to do later in the game is pretty awesome - however, the contents of these desperately need a boost in the arm. As many others have said, there are too few encounter cards for the cities and general locations, which is easily solved by an expansion. I would have preferred more cards in the game-box from the off, maybe even double what is presented, and paid a greater sum for the game - I was going to buy the game regardless of cost anyhow.

I feel, from my brief exposure, that solo quests are rock hard - which is nice, but feels at odds with the fact that [i]Eldritch Horror's[/i] A.I doesn't discriminate between solo and 2-player games.

In EH's favour, it is one of the few games of recent memory that doesn't seem to have any thematic conflicts. All the rules fit the theme particularly well, I've found.

Gloriously, all the conditions have a 'kicker' on their reverse side. This I love. For instance, if your character takes on a debt to gain assets, sometime later 'somebody' is going to come knocking asking for the debt to be repaid. Could be a loan-shark, or it might turn out to be someone much, much shadier. All the flip-sides are different, which means you'll never know what the possible punitive effect is until it's too late.

Another plus: the twin rulebooks are a triumph of layout and thought.

The theme absolutely drips from this game, and unlike other Lovecraftian games from ffg, this one in my opinion plays more like an epic adventure than a dark horror story.

RATING: 10
Well they did it, they basically made a better Arkham Horror.  This game is everything I loved about Akrham minus a lot of the annoying things that made it drag on too long, hard to keep track of and end in an anticlimactic fashion.  I will still go back to Arkham for nostalgia, but Eldritch is now my go to for thematic Lovecraftian adventures.

I've enjoyed this game for a good while, but nowadays, I find that it's just overly frustrating. The entire game is driven by the dice rolls. While there are ways to mitigate your rolls a bit, so often, bad things just keep happening and it all becomes overwhelming. To think I used to really enjoy this game as well, and I do still really like the design, but I hate the combat system so much, but the thematics are quite good. I do enjoy the story based adventure and the fluff text. Just too frustrating to justify though, and it can be very difficult to get to the table as well.

Very similar to Arkham Horror.  Going from City to World exploration didn't really change much.  I was worried that this would be too light, but I found the game to be shorter and streamlined without really losing too much in terms of game play.  Theme is as heavy as ever and the events are a bit more linked to the Great Old One in play.  Would benefit from more encounter cards and I'm sure FFG will oblige.

After the first 5 games I like it a bit more than Arkham Horror. Although Eldritch does scratch a little different itch for me. I'm waiting for some expansions to get more cards for the game, but other than that the game is very good, with a great theme. It's doing a very good job at telling the story as well.

The surprise hit of 2015. I picked this up around the same time as Cosmic Encounter, more or less on impulse, because 'we didn't have a Cthulhu game yet'. I thought we'd get a few plays out of it before we saw all the cards and it became stale. Not since assuming Super Smash Bros on the Nintendo 64 would be a one-day wonder have I been so glad to be wrong about a game. 

Eldritch has bumped our modded Wiz-War off the no. 1 spot for the past year. It's seen dozens of plays and gets better with every game. Played solo it's creepy. Played with a group it's hilariously shlocky. Only the game length stops it utterly dominating every boardgame day. I'm also grateful to Eldritch for rekindling my interest in HP Lovecraft's fiction, which I'd read as a teenager but never quite appreciated.

Listen what the alpha player says and execute that.
OR
Go north or south and take green or red card, read the amateurish horror "short story" prologue, throw some dice, see whether you succeeded or failed (if failed, decide whether to use your last clue token, or if you don't have any do not worry about them), and see what good/bad you will get. Begin your downtime. Begin to think whether to move north or south next turn. Check your clock. Only 3-4 hours to go of this enjoyable experience. Dream of other games. Dream of women. Dream of SOMETHING. Don't worry, the alpha player will play your turns even if you go to the kitchen/bathroom for an hour or two. Don't worry be happy.

After one play:  Just as fun as Arkham with arguably more strategy involved.  I rate it only a 9 for now until I get some more experience.  Possibility that the base game could be stale quickly but expansions will hopefully address this.  A winner if you're a fan of the mythos and different enough from Arkham that if you have friends that dislike the latter, it's worth talking them into one game of this to check their reaction.

EH is one of my most played games so obviously i enjoy it a lot even though i am not a Cthulu fan. It's an enjoyable, masochistic, experience. I would only play it with a maximum of 4 players. 

It's an adventure. The journey is much more important than the destination and you have to immerse yourself in the game's theme. This means reading the flavor text and some role playing. Otherwise it can get dull.

This is important because the more you play it the more you realise that the decision making is pretty light. Most of the time it's pretty clear what actions to take. A few times you might also be looking for things to do. The dice rolling will determine, for the most part, how well the investigators will do.

Having said that i do think that the prioritization is important and interesting i.e. deal with a Mystery, a Rumour or Gates/Monsters.  

A very enjoyable game.

Fun, but long... 4-5 hours with 6 players the first time. Longer with a game that went the distance.

And yet despite the length, I do want to play it. It's a nice adventure/wackamole coop, with some character improvement and good flavour, and generates hilarity. Some of the events are gratuitously bad though, in an unfun way (unsolve a mystery? yuk), and the balance is hard to finesse, with blowouts either way being my experience so far rather than a finely tuned down-to-the-last-turn affair.

Some house rules or expansions* could probably tweak the latter (there are decent options in the rules for modifying difficulty as well), but I'm not sure how to get the time down, so I guess you just need to be in it for the long haul.

I'll probably suggest the "Focus" action from one of the expansions the next time I play, and maybe nerfing Delay effects (use 1 Move action to un-Delay (without moving)) because being delayed is a bit boring. Also, it really feels like killing a monster or closing a gate should "get" you something (yes I know you've delayed doom and that's the real reward). Maybe one of the aforementioned Focus tokens?

In our play (4 players, two of which experienced), in the first six turns, I had to skip four turns ("aufgehalten", "Verloren in Raum und Zeit"), and another four or so in the rest of the game. We didn't even manage to solve one of the three mysteries. And I don't think it was because we played that badly.
For a game of that length, that this kind of game can happen, makes me never want to play it again.

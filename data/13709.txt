GAME: Clash of Giants II
RANK: 2836
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Galicia: Fun and unpredictable game that simulates the initial 1914 campaign in the Galicia Front between the Russian and Austrian armies. Duel of Titans, both risking the colapse after the first clashes.
Start with AH onslaught and easy collection of VPs. Later, the height of the russian armies begins to feel.
3-5 hours to play.

1st Ypres: Very fluid situation for both sides. At first very few units and lots of space to maneauvre. Some doubts on the best deployment of troops. But the position in the Polygon wood-Ypres is critical.
4-5 hours to play.

Very good.

RATING: 7
Clash of Giants II is really evocative of the feel of pre-trench warfare, with its combat system bloody for both attacker and defender, erratic command represented by variable movement allowances, and cavalry reduced to screening and flanking.  The rules are brief, but I'm not fond of the format that gives you the basic rules in one booklet and then extra rules and exceptions for each scenario in a second.  There are one or two irritating omissions too (covered by errata).  I have played both the Ypres and Galicia scenarios.  They feel very different.  Ypres has a low counter density and lots of movement, but after two plays I am wondering how to win as the allies and the 18 turns feel rather long-winded.  Galicia is a slugfest between glass-jawed giants and rather more enjoyable.

Production quality is to GMT's normal standard, with decent counters and a paper map.  The player aids are quite well done and the maps a are quite pleasing to the eye.

Ypres was fun but not awesome ... the victory conditions hinge on just one city in the middle, so there isn't much nuance. OK, but if playing again I'd definitely do Galicia first. I really like the CoG system, but the battles seem rather inconsistent in quality. Of the four battles published, Galicia has been the most satisfying by far. It also, in the grand Ted Raicer tradition, seems to overstay its welcome somewhat in terms of playing time.
---
Played Galicia, it was good fun. A touch on the long side, but not too bad on the scale of Raicer games. Quite playable, it has a very nice operational feel that is quite different from WWII games with its own interesting and different balance between offense and defense. Can be a little dicey, but OK. The different army boundaries make for interesting coordination troubles. I had been prepared for some game imbalance after reading a bit on the net, but we found it to be a very tight game. If the Austrians can ignore casualties and hand on to score 5VPs, it makes it [i]very[/i] tough on the Russians - look at the map, 6VPs is a lot.

Anyway, this is a very nice system and I enjoyed Galicia much more than my limited play with CoGI. I'd like to try Ypres sometime, but the 18 turns worries me. We played 9 turns of Galicia in 4.5 hours or so, and we weren't playing exactly quickly, but this is a system that I think wants to top out at 6 hours at the absolute max (like SCS).

RATING: 7
More WWI fun by Ted Raicer of Paths of Glory fame. Rating based on one play. There are several things I like about this game. The major ones being:

1. Command chit pull system

2. Variable movement

3. A single declared combat per turn

4. Loss checks: mandatory step losses for possibly *both* sides, dependent on Tactical Efficiency and odds ratio

It's also an easy game to learn with only 8 pages of rules. It's nominally similar to A Victory Lost but for some reason it hasn't captured my imagination in the same way (at least not yet). Part of it is the chit pull system isn't as dramatic, since there's no posibility for multiple activations. Part of it is probably the theme as well. I'm just not as familiar with WWI. However, it is a little bit easier to learn than A Victory Lost, feels faster paced, and plays in a shorter amount of time.

UPDATE: I'm enjoying this the more I play it and I'm finding the First Ypress scenario to be surprisingly well designed, especially for being asymmetrical (I've yet to play Galicia). I'm hesitant to praise it too much as a great introductory wargame for fear of discouraging experienced wargamers but this is probably the best introductory hex and counter game I've played. First Ypres in particular has this great situation where the first half of the game emphasises maneuver while the second half emphasises set peice warfare, and both sides have ample opportunity to attack and defend.

Excellent game.  Random chit activation makes is solo friendly and keeps down time to a minumum.  The Galicia battle gives both the Austria-Hungary and Russian player a chance to attack and defend.  Plays quickly (for a wargame), probably in about 4 hours.  Check my full review on the game's page.

RATING: 6
Provisional rating after 6 plays in Galicia scenario. Interresting mechanics which provide uncertainty to movement range and activation of armies. First turns are race for VPs, especially Austrian, because once captured, and counted in 4th and next turns, they are impossible to lose even when locations are fight back. For that reason Russians must attack from the beginning which creates a meeting engagement. 
All games won by Austrians - they are favored strongly IMO. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
CoG II picks up where the first leaves off and evolves it in a number of pleasing ways without muddling up the core rules.

The newly-introduced chit draw activations make CoG II a solitaire-friendly experience, and one that you can play in an afternoon or evening. As with the Tannenberg scen in the first CoG, these scens lend themselves to a pretty decent balance with both sides having viable winning strategies at their disposal. The Galacia scen is particularly satisfying for players who enjoy a situation with the potential for great, wheeling movement that puts one one simultaneously on the attack and defense.

Good fun and demands a lot more play to see if my early positive impressions of balance hold true over time. Still, I suspect my deep interest in the subject matter will keep me coming back for more regardless.

RATING: 6
Interesting yet simple system. I'm normally not a fan of chit draw games, but it works here because of the limited movement and limited attacks. Good solitaire suitability, too.

There are some annoying rules ambiguities here and there for both scenarios, but we were able to work them out.

Update: After a couple plays of each scenario, my rating has dropped a bit. We found the Galicia scenario to be a bit of a grind with not much happening in terms of maneuver, and a playing time that's about an hour longer than it holds my interest. The First Ypres scenario is much better in terms of maneuver, but is ultimately unwinnable by the Allied player if the Germans just ignore the Belgians once they've captured Bruges.

The upshot is that both scenarios have shoddy victory conditions. The straightjacketing that the designer has become notorious for can be badly gamed in First Ypres. The victory conditions in Galicia feel like they were a very late development given their hacky feel and the mismatch between the rules and the VP track on the map, with the net result that the Austrians should always win.

So, not bad for a couple plays each, but then the fun wears out.

RATING: 7
Simple wargame featuring two battles from 1914 - the Austrians and Russians at Gallicia, and the Western Front Marne.  Like the first game, this comes with a set of standard rules, and a set of scenario rules for each battle.  Again, you have to "unlearn" the basic rules to learn the scenario specific rules.  Still, this is a bit more polished and more interesting than the first game.  The game has also incorporated chit pull activations that activate small portions for the forces at a time, and you can now only declare one combat phase per turn - interesting!  The Eastern front has the sparse Tannenburg game replaced by the meaty Gallicia - brittle Russians and Austro-Hungarians set up asymmetrically along an huge front.  It makes for a fun game that plays in about 3 hours.  Haven't played the Marne yet.

RATING: 5
interesting system and battles, not very complex either. Uses chit pull, variable movement based on die rolls and 1 combat per round called after a chit pull per player to drive tension. I've found Galicia to be pretty balanced over two games with early game movement roles potentially having a big effect. This isn't really a game about proving who is the bestest general anyhow, but more of a world war 1 story.

edit, Ypres is a bit long, took almost 5 hours for a light game. Very chaotic too.

Nice clean design system. I like how the chit-pull system and the attack-only-once-per-turn mechanic create some interesting decisions for players. But for its simplicity, the game length is still very long and in the Galicia scenario, that is not good, given the game's glacial pace. Ypres is so different to other games because of its freewheeling nature at the start that it makes for some interesting tactical decisions, for at least a few games. But there isn't much you can muck about with in terms of strategy - the ridge is so dominating that the first few turns guarantee a rush for the ridge.

Excellent game with a great dose of tension, simple mechanics, well-written rules and good map/counters quality. 

It features two scenarios, Galitzia and First Ypres, that are really two different games since each one has special rules while general rules are followed.

A great game breaking down operational conflicts throughout World War 1.  Lots of interesting options and while a lot is up to luck, it also has a great deal to do with how much you are able to take advantage of fortuitous rolls.  The random nature of movement and activations through chits and die-rolls allows things like weather and command & control to be merely abstracted into the larger system of play.  

The Combat is very attritional and messy and leads to WWI style tactics.  ZOC are one way to kill your enemies, though that only works sometimes.

Very enjoyable and looking forward to the ACW game.

A game with so much luck involved that can be frustrating. 
Your better armies could do nothing if you don't roll for activation properly. The combat system can result in no step loss or the lose of one step for every unit. 

Attack is over-rewarded for a WWI game. 

In the game I played I encircled 2 austrian divisions with 8 russians with equivalent combat factors. I became unable no elimitate the two divisions in three turns due to activation die rolls and in this time they shattered one half of my force with 2-1 / 1-1 attacks.

RATING: 9
Ordered after 3 months of investigating. Will probably play this solo most of the time.

A WW1 game with belgian troops. You just can't go wrong with me then..My great grand father fought in this war (and in the Ypres campains, which is in CoG II), so naturally I have to get/play this.
Hopefully GMT will succeed in pleasing me while I descent in the darks of wargaming.


UPDATE 1: Now played first Ypres twice & Galacia once. I must say that the VP scoring in rules in Galacia are a little more abstract. I'm not sure I like that. The Ypres campaign holds more tension for me, there were the Galacia campaign seemed to be more of a slugfest, of which I more or less had enough after 7/8 rounds.
I'll have to try it once more to see if it was just my tactics that there screwed up by the Ypres-min-set.

UPDATE 2: Played Galacia for a second time. This game just needs to be played in a more historical way. Although I'm still not realy sure I like the vp-system, it's fun to play.

So: Ypres Campaign - 9.5
    Galacia Campaign - 8.5
Which combines into the 9 as shown.
(after a germans victory in Ypres, my Ypres-reating went to 9.5, overall score now a 9)

Fast playing, good rulebook (although putting exceptions to the rules in italics makes my eyes skip them, irritatingly), interesting situations and replayable because of the variable movement factors: but this game unfortunately confirmed my suspicion that I am bad at, and not very interested in, post-1900 operational games. Not sure how balanced Galicia is.

PbeM suitability: medium. Logs are per chit draw (or multiple if you get more than one) but there are a lot of decisions for the defender in combat (cavalry withdrawals, retreats) which slow things down.

Woven within a fairly short rulebook of only 8 pages for what appears to be a low complexity war game lurks a rich and unique game system that impressively captures the operational feel of the opening days of World War I. 

Units are divided into sections. Movement allowances within each section are variable, subject to change with a die roll. Determining which player and section moves next is done by drawing chits representing a side and a section. 

Combat and movement, while not simultaneous, are not really sequential in the traditional wargame sense. Players with the initiative choose the moment to declare combat once per turn. At that point every unit in all sections, regardless of whether units in a section have moved, can attack adjacent defenders. Once the attack is made, no more attacks by that side can be made for the rest of the turn. Sections that haven't moved yet, will still get a chance to move, even when combat is finished. 
This really adds tension to game play. Do I wait to move units into more advantageous positions, or do I strike now before my opponent wins initiative and has a chance to move away or move units up to create a stronger defense? 
As with just about every other war game, the combat system uses an odds ratio, but in this game the odds are used to determine a die roll modifier applied to each individual attacking or defending unit. Each unit has a tactical efficiency rating (TER). A die is rolled seperately for each individual attacking or defending unit. If the modified die roll is more than the TER, the unit takes a step loss. 

Cavalry presents another interesting mechanic. Cavalry are not allowed to attack infantry. At first glance, this might appear to make them somewhat useless, but all units must stop when they enter a zone of control, cavalry or otherwise. Combined with their higher movement allowance and ability to retreat before combat against infantry, cavalry can be used to great effect to slow down the advance of infantry. In fact, screening advancing enemy units was indeed cavalry's main role during WW I.

The Clash of Giants systems is improved in this edition by the addition of one combat phase per side per turn. Now each player has to decide if it's worth waiting to get more Armies into contact (and risk the enemy reacting to the earlier move ) or going for a partial attack now. It still provides a lot of flavor and simulation value for a simple package. I like the Ypres Scenario better as a meeting engagement it has few units at first for each side and lots of room to manuever, Galicia with it large armies (4 per side!) is more of slugfest as both sides rapidly fill up the map.

A lot of fun and an excellent follow-on to Glash of Giants. I prefer the Galacia front...and it gives a good representation of that theater.

(Rating after one play of Galicia scenario.)

Pros:
 - simple and easy to learn: no exceptions, no special rules to add chrome etc.
 - some really nice ideas (only one attack allowed per turn, variable army movement rate)

Cons:
 - balance (or lack of thereof)
 - sloppy rules. With this game I realized I probably don't want to see another Ted Raicer's game - though the design is fine, figuring out all the details missing from the rulebook is irritating.

Flow of the the game was very disjointed. Movement as you have to roll for it was all luck and not based on supply or any momentum. This to me is the biggest flaw in the game along with the usual scripting from this designer.

Because of not having any consistency with the movement allowance most of the game we constantly felt that we were always reacting to events rather than using any cohesive plan.

A satisfying operational level WW1 game series so far by Ted Racier...Now gone east, the Clash of Giants II turns to the Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres.  The second one has gas attacks so notoriously knonw. SLA Marshall wrote: "The unusual length of the war, its barbarisms and atrocities, the flood of maimed and mutilated individuals turned back to society, the submarine sinkings, the starving civilians--all of these things are less shocking than that vast armies were raised, maneuvered into annihilation, and acieved nothing through their deaths."  This system really can recreate this sort of things.  For those initiated, 1914 by John French gave a good account of the first campaign in Ypres, sub-divided into several phases.  A great companion read for this game.

A great game that has a fairly easy set of rules but still presents the player with interesting decisions.
The chit pull system makes it ideal for solo play, and the fact that you have to keep your armies within their boundaries and can only attack once per turn is a challenging puzzle.
Do you attack before you move to open holes in your opponents line to exploit, or do you move into contact and then attack and hope any holes are still there next turn?
Really enjoy playing this.

RATING: 8
In my opinion this is an absolutely classic operational-level wargame. With a simple rule-set it very precisely captures the feel of WW1 mobile warfare - the constant worries about keeping in contact with friendly units on your left and right, the difficulties of co-ordinating large-scale movements, the slight superiority of defence over attack and the tendency for things to bog down. I like the combat system and the way that troop quality is separated out from raw manpower. And the chit-pull mechanic generates friction and anxiety aplenty.

I bought this on Ebay for the 1914-2014 centenary, though it is almost OOP. The system is different, though simple with variable movement for units in each army sector according to a die roll when their chit is drawn. Infantry have 2 steps and cavalry one step with each unit rolling against morale in a fight, those that fail lose a step and if defending outside a fortress they retreat as well. The Galicia scenario is heavier in units with the Russians in the driving seat. To counter this the Austrians win VPs at the end of each turn, but the Russians only at the end of the game. In my case grabbing a couple of towns in Russia and the surprizing resilience of some Austrian units when all around had fled led to an Austrian 6-4 victory, even though they lost Galicia. The Ypres scenario has only a handfull of units at the start with reinforcements coming in, so their was less fight as the units have plenty of space. As the Allies control the map it's up to the Germans to make the running and by taking Ypres from a French division and holding off attacks by the BEF they won 5-4 (VP towns at the end of the game).

RATING: 7
Same fun system but ahistorical simulation. Finished a game of Ypres but not Galicia (somehow my opponents never was as inclined as I was to get it over with). Ypres never even got the Belgians in action but was good fun trying to hold on a more direct concentrated German effort. Galicia was actually more fun but like I said, never got to finish.

UPdate: Finished Galicia awhile back and have to admit that it was very enjoyable.

The CRT is not about how much damage you inflict but how much damage you suffer. Perfect for World War I.

Of the [i]serious[/i] [b]wargame[/b]s I tend to like the lighter ones, so this one is one of the better ones. Also, it's fun to play a [i]modern[/i] wargame that's about [b]World War I[/b] which feels like a breeze of fresh air against the endless line of WWII-wargames.

"We were unprepared for war, or at any rate for a war of such magnitude."
- Sir Douglas Haig

CoG II picks up where CoG I left off featuring two more early WW I battles.  First Ypres is a meeting engagement following First Marne.  Both sides keep funneling troops in to establish a front and control the majority of nine objectives.  Galicia is more of a slugfest with both sides deployed near their shared border and ready to go at it.  i believe Galicia is more appealing to many having a shorter turn limit (10 vs 18) and the sides are already deployed.  Galicia will see each side wheel around the center since each side has a strong left and a weak right.

Same system as CoG I here with three basic changes:  

1.  The chit pull system now combines the chits in the same cup.  
2.  Combat is declared once per turn.  
3.  Offensive ability (equals a one column shift for infantry) turn limited by each game.

I love the changes and would like to see them retrofitted to CoG I.  Each game has its usual special rules as well (unknown TER for German Reserves, rail supply, etc).

Ted and GMT have another winner!

Relatively simple game, although IMO not a first wargame. The combat declaration rule is the killer mechanic, and I like it. The two battles are dissimilar; neither is ideally balanced, but Galicia can be more easily adjusted.

I missed the first one but I like this one (should get the reprint of the other), prefer the Galicia scenario

RATING: 7
Great simple hex-and-counter system with lots of depth.  Unfortunately the Ypres scenario is clearly unbalanced, but Galicia is excellent.  Ypres would be good fodder for introducing a new wargamer, by given them the Germans who have lots of room for error.

Played with Keith Potter in Feb of 07.  It seems like it might be a fun game.  Low counter density.  So interesting choices.  We will play it again.

Second title by the best World War I designer. CoG I is almost impossible to get unlike you find a chance on second hand or ebay and be ready to pay a bunch of money. So this sequel is a good opportunity to get a flavour from this system. Two games in one, one based on Eastern front and other on Western, so it is possible to feel the whole WWI excitement. Game offers players the best from Raicer games, that is, easy learn, fun to play just historically accurate. If you play it, you love it.

There are two two-player scenarios, each one nicely balanced. Rules are reasonably simple, but strategies will take time to perfect. Well-done, but not super-thrilling.

Updating my rating to a 9 on yet another great play. This game hits exactly my sweet spot. Clear, short and elegant rules. Interesting topic. Good choices to make. Solo friendly.

Rating based entirely on the Galicia scenario. The fact that I havent even touched the other half of the game can only bode well.

RATING: N/A
Pretty decent game. Seems like the VP point system leans to the Austrians not having to do very much and the command movement system makes it so that a couple of poor rolls or good rolls can dramatically change the outcome of the game. 

In my second play of the game I played as the Russians. I almost completly destroyed the Austrian Forces but ended up with a tie because the several units holed up on VPs totally surrounded rolled ones.

Galicia is AWESOME, though I agree with Ted that a little rebalancing is necessary.  I super dig the "saving throw" combat system, and the combo of chit pulls and variable movement allowances keeps perfect planning at bay.  Like every other wargame I seem to play these days, it's an hour a turn.  Have to work on that.

Played Galician battle of 1914. Don't know the history all that well but played out comparable to notes in the scenario booklet. Simple but not simplistic ,although used a lot these days ,is the best way to describe this game.Hope Ypres battle is as good as this one.

Very enjoyable hex and counter wargame.  Rules are clear and concise with the chit pull and random movement mechanics adding a lot to the game.  Game includes two scenarios which both provide very entertaining games.

RATING: 7
Based on one play of Ypres which I mucked up as the Allies, the chit pull system coupled with variable movement rates and easy rules makes this a winner in my book. Plus as a bonus it solos well. More to like--big hexes, 1" counters, and only 8 pages of rules. Rating will probably go up with more play.

Played 1st Ypres. Anxious to play again, early on we made an error in play that we straightened out later. Situation seemed to develop kind of slowly, but that issue may go away as we speed up our play.

I really liked a lot of the innovation in the rules, and the fun...however, the game took us well over seven hours to play...much too long for a "fun" game.  If it were a three hour game this would be rated a nine.

Cuando lo probé supuso una gran sorpresa favorable. Las reglas no están todo lo bien escritas que debieran y complican el juego mucho más de lo que debieran porque es muy sencillo.
Juego divertido y jugable en una tarde. Si te gustan los wargames de la IGM este n odebe faltar en tu colección.

This is a quick and easy game to learn and play - meaning it will hit the table more often than bigger, more complicated games; having big hexes and counters will help in this regard.

Plays well. Two novel mechanisms, chit pull based on areas and  a combat phase that needs to be timed well. The Galicia scenario is rather static in one way, and I was not perfectly comfortable with the fact that zoc's are rigid. Apart from the two novel mechanisms this is a throwback to the 1970's.

"Easy" wargame...not a super complex system.  Chit pull keeps you on your toes

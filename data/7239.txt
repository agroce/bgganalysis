The winner seems to be the player who collects the ones and twos in the Balkans and the Baltic, or what is left of them. Only works with five players [which may clarify these ratings], and the fifth player is clearly at a disadvantage. The Spanish war is tricky, as win or lose whichever side goes first does best spending all their money in an attempt to solve it, given that your own civil war is better than someone else&#039;s. Seemingly great repeat play value [in a 5-player], due to variable emergence of the play area and Triffids. Cinderella map cards like 2E will, on rare occasions, last till the end, which is a good sign. The rules and cards may appear simplistic but as this one can&#039;t be played through a visor closed, moves &amp; card plays may take some time to decide. 
So how many GoodBergGames is that?

Components are not very good. The card-map looks quite ugly. Having said that, the game play is very good. The interaction between cards and each player is vital to holding off the horde. A flavorful game with religious differences within. Gives the feel of a light History of the World-cum-area occupation wargame. 

Would like to see a delux reprint with better components.

Played 3-player game today using the variant from BGG and Chris's 'enlarged' map cards also from BGG. To be honest I (and I believe my opponents) had fairly low expectations but we all thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it would have been very frustrating tyrying to play with the original map cards.

Overprized game with low production value. The map made by cards is horrible. Event cards are fair made, the counters are ugly and not enough.
The game is quite chaotic and random  for the events can paralyze you without nothing you can do except recover.
I like the concept of mongol scourge over europe:
a well realised idea.
The game is less satisfactory for it is repetitive and boring on the long run.

Hard game to rate. Rated as a game, definitely sucks. Deeply flawed, with so many jarring missed opportunities - event cards are very dry and boring, the game is more just random than chaotic, rules are overwrought as usual, serious kingmaking issues, the design of many components is not great, the game is much too long for the near-zero content. Far too many fiddly chrome rules (Knights of Christ are prime offenders). One element of the game, the map cards, is in fact flawed I believe. All in all, you can't point to any element of the design that rises much above mediocrity. And yet ... the game does manage to engage. Just barely, but it does; maybe as a sort of "History of the World-lite", but without the strategy; just the diplomacy and/or whining, depending on who you are playing with. A few tolerably interesting decisions driven by the need for money. All this, and horrendously overpriced. All in all, probably the worst game I would actually play a second time, although only with a crowd that refused to play anything better (hi there, consimworld guys).

A euro-ish empire game from GMT. The randomness, especially in the way the map is constructed (players draw map cards and add them to the map), makes any long term planning impossible. This makes the game too tactical for an empire building game in my opinion.

Definitely a better game than the chin-stroking "I'm a bit concerned about the luck element" crowd would give it credit for, Medieval is a pretty decent condensation of an EOTMA-type game to something considerably more accessible.  Yes, there's a great deal of chaos but it's a fun kind of chaos as long as you play it in the right mindset and don't expect it to be the ultimate expression of your strategic superiority to your peers.  The production is pretty sorry- not enough chits, crappy cards...GMT makes enough money that they could do better than this.

Not bad for what it is: a longish, fiddly, random fluffy wargame.  There's lots of negotiation, and lots of crucial battles decided by a single die roll (but not enough for the randomness to even out).  Our game ended up coming down to who got the last turn, and who ended up with Hungary (which changed owners on each of the four final turns).  Overall, it's a nice ride, plenty of flavor, and probably wouldn't always take the 3.5 hours it took us (it went until the last action card was drawn).  But not really my cup of tea.  I'd rather play Wallenstein...

RATING: 2
The worst production game I've seen.  I'm shocked that GMT would put this out.  For a BErg game, it was realtively easy to follow this rule set.  Not much meat to the game, but if Middle Ages are a favorite, the game is a light play and enjoyable with 4 or 5 players.

RATING: 3
This Berg title has managed to pack most of the worst elements in gaming into one convenient package: unrestricted alliances, fiddley turn restrictions, game-ey mechanisms, backstabbing requisite to victory, rich-get-richer economies, clear hoser cards (eg: civil war), massively unbalanced factions, etc. Feels like it wasn't really playtested. It does succeed in one fashion: it manages to pack a big-feeling empire game into a fast-playing game, and it does this better than most any other empire game I can think of. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to save this mess of a game.

RATING: 7
First, positive impression after a couple of plays, I need more of them to refine my vote.
*UPDATE* In 3 players, it lacks the fun of trading, dealing, helping, backstabbing. The marriages, a good way to bind agreements (to break at the very first opportunity!), lose their flavour, being used just to grant passage for an attack.
In 4-5 players, it would be 8 for me; 6 in 3 players. So, I keep my first rate.

Fun conquest game with some interesting abstractions (no actual armies on the board) and some great historical flavor for the period.  Some rules a bit too complex for the amount they contribute to gameplay (e.g., Knights of Christ).  Game is a bit too long and repetitive unless house rules are used to shorten the game (e.g., reduce card deck size).  Not sure yet if game allows much overall strategy due to the randomness of getting power cards; I also wonder if the endgame is usually the same: a grab for Hungary (easiest to conquer, worth a lot of points).  The components are overpriced for what you get; also, I printed out enlarged map cards, which are much more usable.

My wargame group plays this all the time. Contrary to some commentators it is a fast game. Cards against opponents to keep them in check. The Mongol horde can destroy an empire. Plagues can hit a major area. Excommunications can undermine a player. Quite a lot going on in a small package. Too much chaos in IMO.

A fine "take that" type of diversion, but a bit too shallow to be a truly great one. I have two major complaints about the game. First it seems to degenerate into a tug-of-war for certain areas (for example Hungary) and if you are unlucky enough to get bad rulers you are pretty much done.

Other than the size of the map cards, there is no reason why this game doesn't get more love. It's loose, fun, strategic and chaotic, with a great end-game mechanic. Make the larger cards, add some eurocubes, and try it again.

RATING: 6
Not a must play game, but enjoyable with the right crowd.  It really needs a mapboard, as the map cards just aren't big enough for the counters, etc.  Which raises the question of why there is such a big box for such a small game, yet no map.  With a little retooling this would be a lot of fun.

Can be difficult to pick up and map cards are rediculously small, had to print larger ones to use. Also used game pieces from other games to simulate moving armies since its easier to visualize for most than just saying i am attacking with no visual clue on the board.

Once i improved the gameboard and added some visual aids ,play picked up and played much better. Otherwise i would give it a much lower rating.

Un juego de Richarg Berg que fue un intento de Eurojuego, pero sin la magia de estos, Controlas de forma abstracta varias potencias medievales dictando el final del juego la invasión mongola, el tablero se realiza con Cartas, las cuales se mueven, algunas fronteras no se ven bien y ciertos marcadores se salen de algunos territorios pequeños, y aunque la calidad de ilustraciones y componentes es buena, el juego resulta descompensado y algo tedioso después de varias partidas, en algunos turnos no sabes que hacer, y en otros puedes realizar una guerra total. Por el precio que cuesta el dichoso juego en España puedes obtener algo mucho mejor diseñado y de mejor calidad.

Lo cierto es que Richarg Berg no está muy acertado con los diseñor de sus Eurojuegos, y el tema de este en si era interesante, darse de leches en la europa medieval, pero sinceramente y este es mi consejo, se puede gastar uno los euros en un juego mucho mas interesante.

A light game, quite fun. I like the Mongols first giving hints of their approaching arrival and then wiping out half of the board. Actually I personally enjoy taking at least one eastern power (usually Seljuks or Russians), so that I`ll have to deal with the Horde eventually.

Revealing the map through card draws is a fun idea. I also appreciate the fact that picking one of the big hitters (HRE, France, Russia etc.) has a drawback in making you more vulnerable to random plague and change of ruler die rolls.

RATING: 6.5
One of the odder games by Richard Berg, I guess, Medieval is almost a Weuro, focusing on the Medieval struggle for survival and control of Europe in the face of Mongol invasions and a great deal of (high-level) disaster and calamity.

The game is played on a map made of separate cards forming Europe in the 13th C.  There is a great deal of high-level conflict, and high-level disaster, heresy, Papal interference, etc., but really this boils down to area control of the most valuable plots in Europe when the game end is triggered by the 7th wave of nearly-unstoppable Mongols.

Because the game end is randomized, it's somewhat difficult to plan an endgame strategy.  But because the total number of Mongols are known, you can see where the invasions must stop, at worst, and choose safe starting land(s) West of the line.

In my solo 4-player learning game it turned into an easy runaway for Harry England, who bettered the others, conquered turf, and easily dominated the game.  There is a certain amout of head-to-head combat resolution, so some luck is in play, but money talks very loudly, so safe income is difficult to unseat.

Also, the abstracted confederations of color lose something thematic compared to, say the national groups in History of the World, another abstracted roll through history.  You find it harder to care about Blue when it isn't the Franks, or the Romans or some people in particular.

The mechanics are little herky-jerky, but not unplayable; still they are not either as simple or as elegant as HotW (one of my family's favorite games).

Finally, the random game end came a little late for what the game was; I was really ready to have wrapped up earlier than the game closed.  That is random- it could come much, much earlier- but still the chances are it might last a little longer than one's interest, unless it was very tightly faught.

So I will start this at a 6.5 - a decent but not spectacular effort, and an innovative little game.  

PS: I suspect this one will be best with a full count of 5 players, so I'll try that count next time.

Really quite wonderful.  The best Berg (multiplayer) game yet; lots of detail and capability for replays.  Reminded me of Empires of the Middle Ages combined with Blue Vs. Grey.  My first game took two hours or so. That was with the designer sitting to my right, commenting on things, playing against people who were veterans, so it will probably longer approaching it cold.  I will say that Medieval might not be to everyone&#039;s tastes; There&#039;s a lot of history in the background you haven&#039;t thought of since you took INTRO TO WESTERN CIVILIZATION your freshman year.  I found it fascinating and a lot of fun. My money was not wasted.

The negative reviews of this game appear to be Euro enthusiasts getting upset because there is Combat. Actually, this is a nice lightweight game. I have played it extensively, and the statement made by another comment that the last player usually wins is not the case. Play has a number of nuances that give the game a good strategy flavor, among these are the proper play of the cards and positioning yourself both in relationship to the other players and to the Mongols.

That said, the components are flatly not good. The Map Cards are too small, and should have at least been on counterstock. The markers are bland, and there are not enough of them. Finally, the rules as shipped have a number of vague places that can create issues. Fortunately on this last item updated rules are now available at the GMT website that are far tighter.

A very interesting war game with a horrible map (cards) and pieces that really detract from the quality of the design. Also, excommunicating seems pretty useless and in the 4 player game I tried by myself there was no need for marriages. Perhaps the attack of the Monguls coming so soon and destroying 1/2 of the map caused some of these problems?

Game packaging is attractive as usual. 
The pre-warning system of the upcoming Mogol raids after 2 Mongols cards drawn makes the players excited about when the Mongols onslaught would be coming. It casted a sense of something big coming up. The effect of Mongols invasions is devastating: a map card is permanently removed....talking about the power of the Mongols. 

It is more interesting to play Catholic powers. More actions can be and only be performed by Catolics powers: Cursades, Knights of Christ, Arrange Marriages, Excommunications etc. 

The rules are in general complete but written in a fiddling manner (a usual problem for a card game), particularly with respect to the timing of playing the various action cards and of making deals among players (there is no specific game segment in the sequence of play as to the makign of deals, but rather, littering the actions among different part of the rules without a general statement regarding the timing of making deals or what kind of deals could be made).  The rules could have solved most of the problems but the style of rules writing raises doubts for the serious players.  

The 110 cards are beautifully rendered with Medieval style graphics. The current color scheme is on the lighter side. Cards could have been more easily distinguished with a color scheme that is more shaprly contrasted. Gameplay can be flowing like water once the rules are clarified and agreed with each player.  The complexity is low but the interactions among players raise it.  

Furthermore on the downside, the game markers are inadequate once the actions get heated, something that should have been identified during the game development stage.  Obvioulsy, the game is dwarfed by a poor game development. 

The game is definitely NOT a solitaire game.  Unless you can find 3 to 5 players who are interested in the period at the same time, the game could sit on the book shelve for a while before you get  enough players.

Medieval is popular with our "wargame" group and oddly enough at home with some people who would prefer to be considered "non-gamers". Would like to get some others in the "Euro" group to try it. One person did but we pushed it by playing with 6 and it was an odd affair with nearly no conflict (not against each other). Best with 4; a bit loose with 3.

Why on earth it was published with (playing card size) cards for the map is beyond me...

It is also a rare game as it is a Rich Berg design that one can actually explain to others.

It's a nice games. It catch the feeling of the 13th century with rules that are someway abstract (i.e. crusade or pope) but well balanced.

I missed it in pre-order, then heard great things about it.  Perhaps it was my expectations, but I was underwhelmed.  Not a bad game by any means, but something's lacking.  Maybe not enough different cards, maybe something else.  I like the idea of the cards making the map, but I may have been expecting it to be more like "Blue vs. Gray", which it isn't.

Update 1/21/07: Played again with the updated rules and found the gameplay smoother (or perhaps just better explained).  We all had a lot more fun this time, and we're going to try to get this out again soon to solidify the rules in our heads.  Upped 1.5 points to 6.5.

I could not recommend this game under any circumstances as I found it extremely painful to play and that has nothing to do with the fact that you have to attack players.  It just isn't very much fun.  A review I read of this game was right on the money.  If you are a war-gamer, you will probably like this as a light war-game.  If you are not a wargamer, you will "almost certainly not" like this game.

Really Fun game. A conquest type of game set in medievil times. It comes with a ton of counters,map cards, and other pieces. You start out controling contries as determined at the begining of the game and try to spread across the continent as the map is built. 

The good: Lots of player interaction. Interesting mechanics. High replay value. 

The Bad: The map cards are made of thin tag board that are easy to ruin. Overall not a very good looking game. The map cards make it hard to keep the map together and tokens in place.
Ugly: The price, I blieve its $45. When you open the box and find the cheap map cards and also not enough of some of the tokens, it's disapointing.

Vague rules and flip-flopping official rules interpretations were difficult to begin with, but the actual play of this game just fell flat with me.  The game lacks good balance during play and the cards read like an alpha draft version.  This might be a great game with more development to bring what seems like a playtest version into what a published version should be. Used to own, but sold it.

03/12/11 Played four-player game in 4.5 hours. I have to give two views. If  I rated it as it came out of the box I'd call it a "4" due to the small map cards and insufficient counters. The owner correcting this at his own expense raises it to a "5".  I like its theme and mechanics. Yet I down grade it on its length (the box says two hours, what a laugh, no ones lies about that more than a wargame company), and incorrect coin ratio (not enough 1's and way too many 10's). Not affecting me directly, but the owner printing the latest rules, at his own expense, enhanced the game for us all. for I saw over his shoulder many rules paragraphs in red that had been modified for clarity. And we did have several questions that he was able to answer via the latest rule set. The components not mentioned above (art work, etc.) were merely so-so. Serviceable, you might say. To sum up, it was interesting to play. But if I don't play it for several years that won't bother me.

Rating after four plays, and all enjoyable ones.  Worth the very long wait as a p500 customer.  Back and forth play, with those far behind able to catch up, and I like the mechanics of the Mongols sweeping accross the map.  Wish the map cards had been bigger, and that there had been more markers, but both cases are not such a problem.

The whole design and its realisation looks clumsy, e.g. too much rules in the rule book instead on the cards. Too lightweight for a wargame and too fiddly for a eurogame it simply seems not to be state of the art in comparision with other publications in our days. If i don't know it better i would think it was done in the 80's (except for the card graphics), before the eurogame and CDG revolution.

The game itself is not bad, but component wise the idea of stacking counters on cards wasn't brilliant, particularly when they have to occupy small areas. 
Print out and assemble the map from the bgg files and just use the cards to indicate areas in play (use the starting area cards face down to cover the areas not in play, remove them as the appropriate area enters play).

What a terrible game! Lousy card based map that is hard to read, cheap square markers that cover most of what is on the ugly map, small dice that are used to determine EVERYTHING during the course of the game. A game that is totally drive by the luck of the draw and the roll of the dice. One of the worst games I have every played! It gets a 2 because it has a nice GMT box.

Love the game, but it loses a couple of points for the card-based board AND shortage of player control markers AND uninspired choice of control marker patterns. Why not something other than bland quilt patterns? They look like countersheet quality rejects from the printing process. I swapped out all the crap control counters for 8 mm cubes in the appropriate colors. Looks great! 

I blew up the cards, printed the images on paper and pasted them to a foam-core board. The area cards are shuffled and placed randomly face-down on each unrevealed area. When a player reveals a new map-card, they flip any one of their choice from the board instead. If the revealed card is for the area they chose, then that area is now active. If it's for a different area, then the area matching the card is active and the card covering the newly active area is moved - still face down - to the area chosen by the player. It works well!

Meccaniche essenziali, ma che non lasciano in bocca il sapore di "modello matematico applicato a un'ambientazione". E che ambientazione! Bella la "fog of war", con non tutti i regni in gioco da subito, e i malus da leader inetti. Menzione speciale alla grafica delle carte, che invece di essere carica di tamarrate tipiche dell'interpretazione classica di medioevo da parte degli americani, rende bene l'epoca ispirandosi ai codici miniati.

Have played it several times. There is a lot of good elements. Do find the way powers are used to attack provinces but not to defend a hard to track. It makes the game to be more offensive than defensive oriented. 
The game does have a good bit of replayability - like how the map gradually develops then disappears. Many of the minor rules don't seem to have a large impact but certainly develops the flavor of the game.
One game I did have a laugh when my friends son played a Pope card to excommunicate his dad's largest power with the line "Give me more money". Ahh he had found the Medieval mind set.

Good game, lousy components. The map is a pain in the b***. It could have done on cardboard instead of cards. Counters fly around too easily in the small areas. They guy who is responsible for the decision to inlude two identical violets for player colours should get fired. Are there only four colours in the universe, soo they had to choose violet twice?

Not a game for control freaks.  Your hand of cards is not a menu of options, but rather a mechanism for acts of God to enter the game.  Players must be unafraid to make spoiling attacks to keep money spent, and table talk is a necessity.  A fun game in the right mood, but it can also be insufferably chaotic.

This was a valiant effort.  I think that it successfully boiled down the big empire building games, into a relatively compact game.  But, at what cost. 

With Civ, outside of the length, my only problem is that if you get nontradeable calamities, not only do you get hosed from the card, but you also miss out on the resource.  Annoying yes, but there is so much more to the game, that it can be tollerable.  With Medieval, a hand with immediate random events, just takes the wind out of your turn.  The game is already so chaotic and out of control, that by taking away the ability to even practice some card management on your turn, makes you wonder why (or rather, if) you are even playing. 

Too many wasted turns for me to really enjoy.

The first time around, this was quite enjoyable... it quickly revealed itself to be a relatively flawed game, however, and I'm not sure how much more I'd want to play this if I've other options.  Still, the theme is fantastic and I have a feeling that if GMT ever revises the rules, Medieval could be a diamond in the rough.  Especially if they reprint it with a larger map -- those tiny map cards are just way too small!

This is a great game! I can't understand the low rating. Have mainly played it 3-player but do have one 4-player in the books. Tense, fun, backstabbin' delight. Definitely get Living Rules. Also make up the larger cards for the map (file available for download in the file section: works great!) Mine look fabulous and were easy to make. Some great mechanics; the Mongols are just the beginning...don't be fooled by the low rating. Give this gem a go!

Update: Have now replaced the cardboard money in the game with metal coins: Awesome!!! Cards are sleeved.

Update II: Have played a 5-player session and the game still rocks.

Richard Berg is the opposite of a predictable designer. Some of his games leave me in awe, fascinated by his historical knowledge, his humor and his ability to put it into a gaming context. Other games, on the other hand, leave me with the question "What the hell was he thinking?".
Medieval certainly falls in the latter category for me.

What a disappointment! While I love the design and artwork on the cards, the mechanics completely fall flat. This game is an excruciating 2-3 hours to play with very little excitement. This is a shame since I love the medieval period. I wanted to like this game so bad, but the reality is that it is a flop. There are very little penalties in this game for losing battles or crusades, and when you try to hurt another player, it actually does very little, and it is easily overcome anyway. A very one-dimensional game. It still hurts.
Update: traded my copy of this game.

Very nice game. I wish the components were better. Just get from BGG the images and make bigger tiles, and replace the cardboard markers with nice glass markers. It has a simple card mechanism, a lot of rules (get the updated rules), and it is a lot of fun. Although it is chaotic in nature, there is strategy. With the right group of people this game shines.

Interesting game.  Essentially you have no units, which makes the game simpler and helps it move along faster.  However, the card text could come with more details to help avoid confusion.  

Has some innovative concepts which people aren't used to, and probably turns them off to the game.
Not a game to introduce to Eurogamers despite lack of units.

A few decent ideas, but also a lot of poor ones (randomly-targeted event cards, for example).  Goes on way too long for what it is - a game this length should have a lot of meat on it, but this is very lightweight and wears out its welcome about 45 minutes in.

So many things I love about this game -- the Pope cards, the Crusades, the Mongols.  But the components are mediocre.  The map cards are too small, so the "map" is obscured once counters are placed upon it.

RATING: 6
Should be good, but isn't.  It's got some very clean abstractions through cards which still manage to keep the flavor of the era.  The dynamic of the Mongols conquering the map is a cool effect.  But the rules are difficult.  I had a hard time getting them to gel before the first game so that I could teach the game effectively, and then it was a second nightmare when specific concepts like the Mongols or naval transport had to be figured out.  We had to make several house rule judgements.  Due to the paucity of support for this older game on GMT's site and here on BGG, we have no idea if our rulings are correct.  If this game took about half the time, it might be worth it, but our plays have all clocked in at 2 hours plus, just too long.

when i have the right type of player s for this i love the game. I like the way it works and how you get lots of back stabbing and its fun going on crusades. I play this game if i want a wargame and a little bit of roleplay to boot. it was a shame about the counters not being enough there so i have bought some beads. and the map can go a little due to it being on the cards and a slippy table.

A simple area-for-points control game with rules far more complicated than they need to be.  The luck of the dice in determining battles and events may put some folks off.  Still a very well themed card game where you need to trade off the choice of expansion with the need for money to fuel your endeavors.  It's good to be the Pope ;-)

What a neat, little game!  Chaotic and deep with possibilities, it's a civ game that covers a lot with a small amount of rules overhead.  Annoying that it doesn't include enough control markers, but it's not that hard to make more.

Interesting game where the map is created by the players using cards, and then the eastern edge is chewed up by the Mongols.  I've played it a few times and enjoy it.  Could have used more control markers, though.

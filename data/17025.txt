This is standard Knizia card game stuff. Clever scoring system and some tricky decisions on what to do. About the same weight and appeal as Coloretto or Geschenkt. There is no need however, for the large boards that come with the game, just a deck of cards and a small box would suffice.

I enjoy playing this game on my iPhone. Poison is a light card game of arithmetic and screwage. You try to time things to get rid of your cards and to hit others with some damaging poison. This game won't keep you up at night pondering strategies, but it is enjoyable enough.

RATING: 4
Terribly fast, feels like a version of hearts in that you're dumping points as fast as possible. But this game has a nasty bite to it: if you're stuck with full pots, there's not a dang thing you can do about it. Knizia struck out with this dud.

RATING: 7.2
Light card game - play a card to one of three pots, when the pot hits a certain total you have to pick up the cards, each card counting against you at the end. Knizia twists in this one are: you can throw away poison which is -3 points; and the player with the most in each particular colour potion doesn't score the negative points.

Friday the 13th is a small fun card game. The artwork is great and the cards are nice quality. As far as  mechanics are concerned, it doesn't bring anything so new or different, because I saw the same concept in many other card games, but it uses it in a way that works better for me. I like the majority aspect and the "cursed" Friday the 13th cards. Also it's much better with more players, as the competition gets tighter and tighter.

A nice game that fits in a pocket and a good addition for my small selection of card games.

Your typical Knizia filler. Quick, simple gameplay, with subtle nuances added to the scoring.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  If you've got kids, bump the rating up a bit, as it does have a fun theme, it teaches basic addition and it isn't complex at all.  Ultimately, the luck of the draw spoils it a bit for me; it turns an otherwise delicious chocolate doughnut into a moldy one covered with ants...

[ESP] Uno de los mejores fillers de Knizia.

El objetivo es ser el jugador con menos puntos, evitando los brebajes tóxicos de los calderos. Juega una carta de poción dentro de uno de los tres calderos, cada una con su propio color. Si el valor total de las cartas en el caldero supera los 13 puntos, entonces estas obligado a tomar todas las cartas de ese caldero. Trata de no tomar ninguna carta de poción, pero si tienes que hacerlo, asegúrate de que tengas la máxima cantidad de ese color, ¡así puedes ser inmune a su poder! Hay 8 cartas de veneno en juego que no solo sabotean los calderos, ¡también pueden sabotear tu puntaje!

RATING: 5
not sure it's worth the time with 3, but i like it plenty once you get to 4 players.  there's probably imbalance in the card distribution because of varying hand sizes, but who cares?  still, quite often i'll play something else that requires no quick reference because i never remember the rules offhand.  i know it's not a big deal to glance, but it's an inhibitor to play.

Egy újabb könnyed Knizia, a pontozásnál egy elmaradhatatlan kis Kniziás csavarral... Egyelőre csak házilagos példányt és mobil telefonos változatot próbáltunk. Kb. Pingu-parti kaliberű játék, annál azért egy kicsit több taktikai lehetőséggel. A szabály kb. 5 mondat, egy kör kb. 5 perc, de célszerű több kört játszani.

Yeah...  Another card game that is very simple and a lot of fun.  I think I am just a sucker as far as card games are concerned.  my first game was definitely enjoyable and would have played more if it wasn't much later.  We played with 6 people and it went well.  Another good card game to be played with 6 people.  Will play again to get a better feel to rate.

Update: 10 Nov 2007
Finally got to play again and I still like it.  Actually for a trick taking game, it is very laid back.  No pressure at all and you tend to really just do what is good for you.  You can try to poison the pots that your opponents are trying to gather but that's about it.  Still I like the game quite a bit and would add to my collection.  I am pondering if I should just make my own deck or buy one.  The game is over produced but certainly the pictures and the pots add to the theme and overall enjoyment of the game.

Add cards to a cauldron.  If it goes over 13, you have to take the cards - try not to take poison!  A neat game - you've always got a good move, but never a great one.  Try to figure out what move will trap someone two or three moves ahead, and leave you with a move to make.

RATING: 2.5
For what boils down to being a simple customs deck of cards, the componants and packaging in a box 40 times bigger than it has to is utter overkill. Scrap the oversized cauldron boards and it fits in your top pocket.

The game play boils down to a random card deal and a lottery as to who gets dealt what. Get weak suited or a lack of wild cards and you are up against it.

Fundamentally this boils down to an over produced simple trick taking game that could be replicated with a standard deck of cards.

Reiner continues to churn out mass mediocrity to keep his average up.

Boxed into a corner to play this nightmare again. And its worse than I remembered. Just no chance to influence play, draw blind, have no idea what your opponants hold either in colour of number. Just beyond diabolically bad, reduced from a massively generous 4 to a 2.5. I'd rather drink my own sick than play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays fast even with kids. Another optimization game from Knizia. The cards appeal to my son's dark side so it will get played often. It could be half the price and come in a regular card deck box. The cauldren mats are overproduced and unnecessary but I like to play with them anyway.

Great little card game! Completely superfluos bits, but still a great card game! Try to either avoid the potion cards or, if you get stuck with some, try to get the most of that color to get zero points for it. Another winner with the GF and her kids.

RATING: 7
Another awesome filler from Gencon! A handful of simple decisions that lead to elegant gameplay and fun opportunities to mess over your friends. You want to avoid a lot of points, but claiming the majority in a suit will make sure none of those points count against you. Simple, but with enough meat to entertain.

There are a great number of card games where the goal is to take as few cards as possible.  However, what makes this game shine above those others is the rule that allows you to not score for a color if you take the most of those cards.  This really elevates the game and offers a number of different strategies that you don’t normally see.  I love how you can work to take just enough that you'll have a majority and then try to stick players with the points for taking the others in a color.

The wild poison cards also add a superb twist that cranks up the strategy one more notch.  I love how you find yourself in predicaments where you will be forced to take cards you don't want, so you end up trying to set up the next player to be in the same position.  There is some simple math in the game, but anyone who can count up to 13 can probably play, which is another bonus.  For a quick card game that doesn't delve into the trick-taking realm, this game really works and should be a staple in more gamers' collections.

Deeply unthematic despite the vague alchemic hints, Poison is a very quick and moderately fun filler: as such, it gives its best when played carefree. [i](April 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games: Poison (now Friday the 13th) isn’t one of those, so I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

Luckily the rounds go quickly and you can recover from one bad round by the end.

RATING: 7
Poison es un juego de cartas muy sencillo. Hay cuatro tipos de cartas (morado, rojo, azul y verde), numeradas del 1 al 7 (excepto el verde, para el que todas las cartas valen 4) con unos dibujos muy monos de pociones. En la mesa hay tres pucheros imaginarios donde se van a ir preparando los brebajes. Los jugadores juegan las cartas metiendolas a un puchero.. con dos condiciones: primero, la puntuación máxima que se puede acumular en un brebaje es de 13 (inclusive) y segundo, una vez que se ha iniciado un puchero con un brebaje de un color, todas las cartas de ese color que se jueguen deben ir a ese puchero y no ha otro (excepto las verdes, que son veneno y se pueden colocar donde se quieran).  Lógicamente, se acaban llenando los pucheros. Cuando no es posible jugar una carta en un puchero (porque está lleno), la carta jugada inagura un nuevo puchero y el contenido del antiguo se lo lleva el jugador (no a su mano, claro). Al final de la partida, se puntua. Cada carta vale un punto, excepto las verdes que valen dos. Eso sí, si tienes la mayoría de cartas de un color, no puntuas nada por ese color.

Straightforward press your luck and hand management game that feels a bit like Hearts and a bit like Blackjack or Chemin de Fer. I don't understand why Playroom published this as a boxed game with the three purely superfluous cardboard cauldrons instead of merely as a small tuck box card game. The game itself is really just 50 cards. If three more cards were used as "cauldrons" and seven more for the rules and/or advertisements, it would make a standard 60 card deck. Playroom has access to the American mass markets, and I believe that the vast increase in sales numbers for a card game in those check-out aisles would more than make up for the higher per unit profits for the boxed game. Poison is a game I might actually buy as a $7 card game, but certainly not as a $15 boxed game.

RATING: 5
Not too bad of a game. Interesting opportunities for screwage, when you use poison cards to, well, "poison" a pot that you know one person has to take. That being said, the basic strategy seems to be to just "top up" each pot to 13 (or as close as possible) during your turn. And with 3p, it's too easy for each player to dominate in one color, leading to poison cards alone determining the winner. I find this game to be roughly in the same fun category as Loot.

RATING: 8.5
Classic Knizia - very simple rules but with more depth than is apparent from them - a nice light game blessed with a real fun factor and difficult decisions to make most rounds, usually painful ones!  The cauldrons are, strictly speaking, unecessary but are a nice touch and the game isn't quite the same without them.

RATING: 3
Not that impressed. I'd rather play 6 Nimmt!, which is saying something. Knizia's small-box games routinely fall flat for me. I think it's because while they still clearly have the great design elements of his larger games, the balances all seem blown away by the randomness. Poion clearly has some underlying tensions that are interesting, but realistically they don't translate into interesting gameplay choices and your score is more luck than skill, which seems to waste Knizia's talents.

Again, a 3 seems harsh to me, but that's the BGG guidelines for "would not play again", so there you go. I would not play Poison again.

RATING: 7.75
Fun little, typical Knizia, math lite game.  We had a lot of fun playing this, and can see it getting a lot of play, as a nice little filler for the group.  Tactics are there, stick to the one colour you are going to be collecting and watch what others take in that colour.  Force poison cards in to cauldrons that your main competitors have to be taking, as they are collecting too.  Don't be scared to take a poison here and there to guarantee highest total in a specific colour.

Played another couple of times and this is becoming a favourite of the group.  A great go to game for filler with enough depth to keep us thinking and enjoying.

Rated a 7.  Can't see it dropping or going up significantly from here.  Solid game.

Took game up to 7.75 (6/8/09).  May end up at 8.5 if it doesn't end up boring us.  Very good.

I'm pretty sure Knizia can take any game he comes up with in his head, add a convoluted scoring system, and it will make it at least a decent game.  I'm fairly certain thats the trick - in order to win, have the scoring drive the gameplay however simple it is.  In fact, I'm sure if Knizia made tic-tac-toe, it would be, you get 3 points for every symbol next to another of your symbol, except for the center which is -2, and -4 if your opponent makes a line.  Play over 5 epochs and see who wins.  This game made me see that.

Rated "6" after one quick play, so this is a "speculative" rating. The game reminds me of hearts, which is one of my more favorite traditional card games. I can see where the main advantage of this game is its accessibility. I'll personally choose Fairy Tale or For Sale over this for a quick filler, but Poison can probably be picked up and played by a larger audience.

Update: I simply was not playing this game. And, my fellow gamers have a copy. Traded away in a math trade.

RATING: 7
This is a quick Knizia card game that scales well for different numbers of players.  It's similar to 6 Nimmt! but uses the sum of card values rather than number of cards to determine when players have to take piles of cards.  I feel that it's overproduced (cauldrons?) but underrated.

I suspect the game is very subject to player count.  Certain 4 players is not the ideal number.  More plays are needed but so far it looks like 3 players is the sweet spot.  5 is also clearly right out, leaning too heavily on the right left binding and luck of the deal.

RATING: 6
OK game, some fun or challenge at least. ~10 plays-- POSITIVES: Low cards good for one thing (avoiding spillover), high cards good for another (dominating a suit). I like it firmly without love, a bit of a light, mild decision-filled Loco-type game.  I think this fits a moderately valuable niche for a game collection. The scoring (set-aside your majorities) is a light echo of the trickiness of Samurai scoring.  I like the textured feel of the cards. The big cauldrons are a fun and helpful component.  I also like the special dealing method when playing with 3 players. NEGATIVES: I think the low cards are a lot more valuable than the high cards. I think the game is too long for a filler, if you play with 5-6 people (thus 5-6 hands).  I would rate it lower if I had to play that many hands.  I want to play maybe 4 rounds at most then move on to something heavier. ANALYSIS: I think there are exactly two strategies, and so then I see tactics and card fate play out to achieve  them. TRIVIA: It's amusing to see Knizia's face in the wizard illustration. I have developed a special way of saying POISON!, with a special poisony gesture, to help the fun factor. UPDATE: Quite fun to play with my 8 y/o niece.

Knizia does it again. 

Poison is very simple. Its almost embarrassing that this was sold in such a big box, when its really just a small card game....even less than a standard deck! But the card quality is top notch, and as usual...I appreciate the completely unnecessary components (in this case the 3 brewing pots). 

There are a few simple rules, and then cagey decisions ensue. That is Knizia's mantra (most of the time). 

The thing that makes Poison work for me is the opportunity to "run at" one of the colors and try to get the majority of cards (negating the bad points). Supposedly this game scales to 6 players, but I'm not so sure that would work as well. We played with 4, and it seemed that this was probably the optimal number. I think you could manage with 3 and MAYBE 5, but 6 would be too much. 

I don't think I would spend money on this one, but I already have a few Knizia fillers and there is really nothing special about this one. I enjoy it. It works. Will I buy it? Probably not, but I'll happily play it if someone suggests it.

Yet another Knizia game where numbered cards add up to wacky scoring.  This is a fun game for about 15 minutes and then it outstays its welcome.  It seems like turn order basically determines whether you get screwed or not.  It's a great production (the colour palette is outstanding- hooray for flourescent green and purple- but the giant cardboard cauldrons make the board in Lost Cities look like an absolute necessity.

An ordinary little game with a silly premise... if you fill a cauldron you have to drink it. Sounds more like a witches drinking game than anything else.

This is a remarkably clever game of pushing your luck (and also a bit of chicken).  While you try to get each cauldron up to the magic number of 13, you're also keeping an eye on who has been getting the most cards in each color, as they won't have to count those points.  A number of different strategies can produce a winning hand.

It's been awhile since I've been so interested in a simple card game.  Devilish fun!

A pleasant little filler, if a bit dry and mechanical. It has a nice balance of opposing tensions and sabotage opportunities and a delightfully tuned card mix. Unfortunately, also features a strong luck component and a pretty intense reliance on accurate card-counting. Oh, and it's dreadfully overproduced; the cauldrons are far too big and completely unnecessary.

RATING: 5
Production: The Playroom Entertainment edition has a horribly oversized box and rules, and three unnecessary cauldrons.  The game would be better served to be packaged just with the cards, in small, manageable box.  The cards are of excellent quality, and though the backs are ugly, the faces are beautiful.  Play: Interesting, quick game of hand management.  In my one playing, I was dealt an excellent hand, and was able to play it well, making me think that perhaps there should be an assessment of hands, and that players score according to how well they do compared with the assessment.

Great game. I played this at a small gaming get together and we all enjoyed it. It made about an hour go by really fast.
My problem with this seems to be that sometimes I "forget" to record my score, as I forgot to count my cards before giving them in to be shuffled one round. We guessed that my score was probably around 34 points again, as that's what it had been in the previous rounds, so I got 34 again. I ended the game with a total of 110 poins, only taking 7 more points in the last two rounds.

I really enjoyed this, just enough math to really make players think, and fast enough and light enough to still have easy to follow conversations.

I'm not sure whether to rate it a 5 or 6.  Decided to go with a 6 since it is intended to be a simple, filler game.  Deal a deck of cards out.  When it is your turn, play a card in 1 of 3 piles.  Each pile can only accept cards of one color.  If you go higher than 13, you take the cards.  Cards count against you unless you have the most of that color.  You could play this game with a deck of cards (combine 2 or 3 to get duplicates of the numbers you need).

Downgrading to a 5.  It feels like a card variant of musical chairs.  Not much strategy...hope for good cards..and hope the be the one who isn't left standing when the music ends.

Until June of 2008 I had never played a trick taking game in my life.

Seriously. I had never played a trick taking game in my life. So Poison was like a relevation to me, and I ended up finding it incredibly intriguing. While I was later introduced to another trick taking game that I enjoyed even more (Zing!, which I will get to eventually...) it still left me with a very favorable impression and a desire to find out more about this genre.

Players play numbered potion cards onto rather large and over-produced cauldrons.  Cards are in three potion suits, or the wild and nasty poison suit.  If the total in the cauldron exceeds 12, cards in the cauldron have to be taken, leaving your card behind to seed the next brew.  Every card taken at the end of a hand is 1 penalty point, while poison cards are 2 points.  The Reiner funny is a majority of cards taken in a suit means you've developed an immunity to that potion and you take no points.  Subtle, if light, card game.

I've been considering this one for a while.  When the new Baker's Dozen version came out, I finally jumped on it. I've got plenty of games about witches and potions, but not nearly enough about food!

I think I like the variant where you deal out all the cards right at the beginning.  

UPDATE AFTER SOME PLAYS: I feels a lot like a cross between Category 5 and Coloretto.  It may be slightly easier to explain that those (admittedly already pretty easy) games, but I think that overall I would rather play one of those than this. However, the people I've played it with seemed to really like it.  My kids especially enjoy it.

Played the original "Poison" theme of the game at Afternoonified (our local game shop). Light but thinky, and although we ended up playing a rule wrong for the entirety of the game (leave the card you play in a cauldron when you spill it) my children and I enjoyed it. The black cat retheme looks good too, and the kids saw it on the shelf. May have to get it one day...

A very light filler, and completely random. You could end up with lucky escapes in the game all the time, because the player to your right is always busting the limit, or you could be the one always with all three pots at a boil when it comes to your turn. How players get themselves in such situations is totally not dependent on skill. Yes, this is just a light filler but there are better fillers out there - I'd rather play For Sale or Ole.

[8 plays]  This game is just delightfully evil.  There’s nothing like that warm fuzzy feeling you get when it’s someone else’s turn and there’s 13 in every cauldron.  

But even though Poison can be crafty and cutthroat, it’s also simple enough that kids can play it, and you can teach it in just a couple of minutes.  Also, because it’s a game played in some number of identical rounds (supposed to match the number of players), you could change the number of rounds if you want a longer or shorter game.  

Some have called this game "overproduced" and suggested that the cauldrons are unnecessary and take up too much space.  I couldn’t disagree more.  The cauldrons are just what you need to make your gaming table feel like the Slytherin common room.  I really like the production and design on this game; the art on the cards is lovely, and it’s a great touch to have how full the bottle is show the card’s value.

13/09/2012 - The game feels like a bit of a friday job.

 The game has three types (colours) of (numbered either 1, 2, 4 or 7) potion cards as well as some poison cards (all numbered 4). The idea is that you play the cards in the cauldrons and the person who takes the value of the cauldron above 13 takes the cards. A low score wins and the number of cards you have determines your score, with poison cards scoring double and the majority in a colour allowing you to ignore the score for that colour.

Quick little game where you fill the cauldrons with varying amounts of potions and if you push it over its limit (13) you have to "drink" the contents.

Players can add poison to the cauldrons which is universally bad. 

You score points relative to the amount drunk. Lowest score wins.

Simple enough rules, fast play.  Strategy in playing but can other players can really mess it up.  

After playing a few times I have increased the rating on this game.  I thought of it as light, but I am having a dang hard time winning this game with any consistency. I have tried a number of different strategies: playing the wild games first, then last; playing large cards first, then last; trying to take the most of ONE color (but often that leads to failure); Trying to take the most of one color of which I have the most cards, or most points; trying not to take anything at all.  I get tromped almost every time.

Play wild cards last.

Also, I like the cards--they are dark, yet colorful.  I find them soothing.  I might eventually tire of this game, but presently it is a bit addictive in my determination to win more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm reserving my judgement until I play it with more than 3 players.  With 3 there just seemed to be a pattern of each player selecting a color to dominate and so to minimize scoring pains.  While this is definitely a smart way to go about it, the lack of drama does not a compelling game make.

Simple game, with some plan ahead decisions.  It is NOT a trick-taking game, but the decisions you make feel very similar... You don't want cards, but once you get some, you want to try to 'shoot the moon', because if you have the MOST cards, they don't count against you. The last 3 or 4 plays of each round are AGONIZINGLY frustrating... and wonderful.

highly consumable light card game with screwage.

Three plays, once with three and three times with four. I like it! A solid, interesting, original card game. Like many card games where the goal is to avoid penalty points, it's all about damage control. Chances are good you're going to be forced to take points in at least one of the three colors, so do you collect those cards to try to gain immunity? If you're too obvious about it, though, you'll find a lot of green poison cards heading your way. Anyway, it's not nearly as light as some people take it to be—if you think it's all luck, you just aren't paying attention—but then on the other hand a bad hand is a bad hand is a bad hand, and it is possible to find yourself in situations where you're getting hammered by the table just because that's the way things are shaking out. Probably at its best with four; might be decent with five, three is okay, but I doubt it's worth playing with six.

Very clean, low drag card play. Instantly addictive and fairly quick. Problem where there seems to be a "drinker's seat" and when you're in it, you don't have a lot of options.  This position is relative to the dealer's position, but the deal rotates around the table, so everyone gets a turn in the dealers seat, and in the "drinking chair."
A great night-ender, fast and easy. However, I've only ever seen one player (hiredman) consistently control his own fate in this game so the "Drinking Chair" problem and the capricious nature of cards can make this game frustrating.

Like so many other Kniza games, all you are really doing here is worrying about the scoring. It's an interesting puzzle though, since you want to get the lowest score, but you ignore your groups which you have the most of. But poison always scores points (which is bad). 

Each round I found myself taking a different approach to things, trying to get lots of one kind, trying to take nothing at all, trying to avoid poison at all costs, etc. None of these things works perfectly, which is a testament to it being a good game. 

It is somewhat dependent on hidden information. Playing with the trackable information being available to all players would likely lead to kingmaking. But this is not a big deal for a quick filler like this. It's in the same vein as another Knizia-Designed-Playroom-Published-Then-Rethemed game, King of the Beasts (Queen of the Cupcakes). 

I understand the decision to make this more kid-friendly by changing it to a donuts theme instead of poison, but it might actually make even less sense. And the box is more annoying to open and store. 

Regardless, this one works as a nice filler and seems to avoid the trap of being "figured out" that some fillers can have. Not a big priority to pick up, but happy to play.

[Initial Impression: 6]
Poison is a very straight-forward set-collecting card game from Knizia.  You don't really need the cauldrons, although they certainly add to the Potter-esque atmosphere, which younger kids (so long as they can reliably count) will especially enjoy.  On their turn, players play colored cards into one of three piles (each color must be played into its matching pile).  If the value of the pile exceeds 13, they must take all of the cards in the pile, leaving behind the one they just played. In general, taking cards is bad news, with each card being worth one negative point - unless you can claim the most cards (regardless of their numbered value) in a color and become immune.  The exception are the green "poison" cards, which always count as 2 negative points.  This is a very light filler-type game, but provides a decent amount of fun and requires some planning for hand-management. Do I start taking cards of one color early in the hopes of getting the most? By doing so, do I risk encouraging others to poison that cauldron?  Should I play my high-value cards early, or save them for later when other players will have a harder time avoiding taking a color?  Depending upon turn order, you can sometimes get stuck in a situation where you have to take cards from one of the three colors - so be ready to "pick your poison".

Another Knizia card game? Ugh.

Update (10/02/11): I played this reluctantly tonight, and actually enjoyed it. It is yet **another** card game from Knizia, but it is not just some re-themed 52 card deck. There are only three suits, with a different distribution of the ranks, plus a number of "poison" cards that serve as a sort of trump and penalty. This has a similar feel to Lost Cities, but has the evasion-type trick taking aspect of Hearts. Ideally, you are trying not to get any cards, as each card is a penalty point. However, you could try to "shoot the moon" and try to grab the largest number of cards of a suit to get zero points for that suit, all the while trying to avoid the poison cards which are worth two penalty points each. An interesting filler that plays in 30 minutes. I'll up this to a '7' from a '5'.

A tight, sweaty little filler.  Has a surprising amount of strategy and tactics for such a simple set up, but then, that's Reiner.  The Playroom edition is embarrassingly overproduced with lush graphics and silky cards.  If you dig Hearts, prepare to have all your acetylcholine receptors locked up by this, Advanced Hearts.

I actually like trick-taking games, and this one is cleverer than most. Plus, it plays six. 

Standard strategies from Hearts are at least somewhat reasonable here, but the distribution of values and the presence of the poison cards mixes things up a bit. 

My thoughts on strategy have changed somewhat from the first game--it's important to control the use of the various colors, so clearing one out really isn't viable.  Hmmm. (2 plays)

I Knizia gem. Played several rounds with 5 people and really, really liked it. Simple, quick, and yet presents some genuinely tough decision making. Most likely to be a hit with fans of traditional card games like Rummy, or Uno, or Bridge, etc.

Although it has had several resurrections, I played it under the label "Poison" and prefer that style to the Baker's Dozen or Friday the 13th or any other labels it's been under.

RATING: 6
An interesting card game. It took a little getting used to because it did not play like other card games I have played.After all cards have been played, the player with the most of each of the 3 potions discards those cards that he collected.  Each card you have left that you collected counts as 1 pt and Poison cards are worth 2 pts.  The points on the cards do not matter at the end of the game, they only matter when you are figuring out how many points are in each cauldron.  After playing a couple of rounds it is pretty easy to figure out.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Poison is a simple, mostly mindless card game akin to No Thanks! or Frank's Zoo.  Players attempt to fill cauldrons up to a certain treshhold without going over so as to avoid taking the contents with each card scoring a point at the end of each round (points are bad).  The twist is majorities in a color score zero and wild "poison" cards count double.  It's a lot like any other trick taking game out there; you decide whether to attempt to nil or lead suit with your actions basically decided by seating order and turn to turn tactics.  It's enjoyable, if not light and forgettable.

After three plays with three different groups, colour me unimpressed. I get the feeling that there is something I just don't "get" about this game. I'll play again, but think my rating is likely to go down if anything!

The "cauldrons", nice as they are, are way over the top production but, much worse, the cards themselves have a flimsy feel to them; some poor production choices made by the manufacturer. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Very simplistic trick-taking game where taking cards is actually bad (though not always).  Sort a mix of mechanics from Coloretto and David & Goliath which makes this sound much more interesting than it really is. I'd say this would be a very good game for young players as an intro to trick-taking type of games though it's not a traditional trick-taking game.

RATING: 4
On the surface, Friday the 13th looks and plays a bit like Knizia's classic Lost Cities except for multiple players. Unfortunately, gameplay results are way too dependent on table position and the hand one is dealt. The only real chance to push one's luck is to go after the most cards of a set - but that option is only best when trying to salvage a bad hand and table position.

In spite of gorgeous cards (that look cool as squares but are difficult to shuffle and handle), I'd pass on this as anything but a children's game.

RATING: 6
The card deck has three colors with cards valued at 1, 2, 5, and 7 and there are "neutral" poison cards valued at 4. The entire deck is dealt. You play a card to a pile of the same color. When the pile hits a value of 13, you take all cards except the last one you played. At the end of a round you score. Those with the most cards of a color discard that color. The remaining cards score 1 point each, with poison cards scoring 2 points. Low score wins after a number of rounds equal to the number of players. 

Like a lot of Knizia designs, the game feels simplistic when you start, but somehow manages to get interesting. It's nothing earth-shaking by any means, but it's a nice game.

Rating based on around 10-12 plays.  A really kind of boring card game filler that gets played because is the lowest common demoninator, quick-playing game that is over quickly.

It still does and I do like the game but I found that the game grew tiring before we got through the complete rotation of dealers.  I felt our games should've moved quicker; I felt that some players took too long to make their moves.  So that may be a factor but I'm not sure my rating would improve any.

Three suits exist in the game and are always in play in one pile.  As soon as one set of cards equal 14 or more, the person making the pile go over takes all the cards in the kettle.  Whoever has the highest quantity of cards in a color gets to get rid of those cards.  All other cards count for one point per card.  Poison cards count as 2 points and cannot be discarded.  Whoever has lowest score wins.

Der ganze Kartenstapel wird unter allen Spielern aufgeteilt. Nun spielt man seine Karten, je nach Farbe auf 3 verschiedene Ablagestapel ab. Derjenige, dessen Karte die Summe "13" überschreitet, muss den Stapel für sich nehmen.
Am Ende gibt es Minuspunkte für jede gesammelte Karte, es sei denn man hat die Mehrheit einer Farbe, dann fallen alle Karten dieser Farbe weg. Zusätzlich gibt es noch grüne Giftkarten die einen Wert von 4 haben und grundsätzlich -2 Punkte geben.
Es ist nicht mein Spiel. Es liegt oft auf der Hand welche Karte ich spielen sollte. Ein wenig Strategie liegt dahinter, indem man versucht alle Karten einer Farbe zu bekommen, aber wenn ich Karten gleichverteilt über alle Farben auf die Hand erhalte und mein Vorgänger 3 mal hintereinander alle drei Stapel auf die 13 bringt, wird es schwer etwas zu reissen.

Feels like a trick taking game where you don't want to take the trick. Easy to learn and the no points if you have majority of a color adds some tactics of whether you should switch to taking as many cards of that suit as possible, but ultimately doesn't really differentiate itself from basic card games in any way, and there might be an issue of being at an advantage or disadvantage depending on where you sit in relation to the other players.

Much as the design is attractive, the gameplay feels very simple. The math element could be valuable, but it is difficult to justify the price of the game.

My opinion of this game has risen substantially with more plays. It's both a terrific family game and a fast filler for gamers. There is a nice mix of luck and skill.

With three hobby gamers, try laying the unused fourth hand up for all to see for less luck. With a casual "non-gamer" trio, stick with the hand unseen.

The production for the "Poison" edition is wonderful.

Very similar to Too Many Cooks.  I was disappointed by the limited decisions I had to make.  Almost every time I played, all of my options caused me to take cards.  Also, the game seems over produced.  I plan to play it again, but my first impression was not very positive.

2nd play: Make it stop!

I love trick-avoidance card games, and Poison is a great one. The theme is cute and the components are excellent -- I love that the fullness of the bottles corresponds to the value of each card.

Poison is one of the most cutthroat games I've ever played, and although it's quite simple every element is carefully thought out and honed to perfection. Lots of screwage, a good amount of luck (good because a skilled played can generally turn around a bad hand), and devilishly clever deck proportions make this one of my all-time favorite filler games.

Nice looking cards, but not a whole lot to offer with game play.

It seems the rhythm of the game is such that when you get stuck taking a pot when it hits 14 points, you will be the one stuck in the same situation again when you next turn comes around.  

The game is cute and does have a bit of the negative points theme that many German card games have, but luck by far out weighs the skill.

I consider myself a hard-core gamer and I don't think any hard-core gamer could look at Poison and think of it as anything but a filler game.  I don't say this as criticism, but rather as a catagorization.  Poison is nice, neat and clean little game.  If it has any shortcomings I would probably say it is a bit overproduced.  While the presentation is very nice it probaby could have been a small-package publication for a third less the cost.

This game has become a popular filler.  The artwork is great.  You place number potion cards a of a single color.  If you make the total go over unlucky 13, then you must take all the cards.  Each card gives you points, unless you have the most of a single color.  You almost always wind up with some card, so the trick is to try to get the most of one color and hope that you pull it off, otherwise you're stuck with negative points.  The player with the fewest points wins.

Plays quickly and the rules are easily explained.  Plays up to six.

Kind of feels like Knizia's take on 6 Nimmt! Instead of everyone choosing and revealing a card, however, this game takes that idea in turns. I can't say I enjoyed it that much, but if asked to play, I might do so again.

While the game is still fun, the theme has really suffered since it switched to Friday the 13th from Poison.  In Poison, the game made more sense; you were filling cauldrons with ingredients, trying not to get them to boil over, and avoiding poison.  In Friday the 13th, you are just avoiding too many ladders and black cats.  

It's a minor quibble, but the new theme just doesn't work as well, and turned me off my plans of purchasing the game.

I got this game at Gencon to play with my then 2cd grade daughter.  Knizia himself signed the front of the box and we had a brief chat about Uni-Konstanz where he and I both worked for a while.  Anyway, it's a cute game.  A nice way to practice simple addition and simple planning at night (i.e., trying to get the most of particular colors while avoiding poisin cards).  Contemplative rather than action-oriented (e.g., Farkel, Life, Parcheezy).  Decent production values what with the three cauldrons.

(Poison) Great adding game with 3 suits. It is so clever that numbers are limited to 1,2,4,5,and 7. Most people consider this as a casual luck-based game. Sure you can play that way. However, I think there are quite a few strategies in this game. When to start taking suit? How do I keep the majority and at the same time make others take some cards for their negative points? When to play a poison card that is very useful "wild"? Should I use my 7 to take a 7 to minimize the damage or play 1 to let it go? How likely that someone will take this pile of 2-3 poisons?

First, I thought it is just a good light game. Now it grows on me and it is an excellent tactical card game. It is fundamental to know card distributions. Since there are 3 suits, it is best with 4 players (same logic as why Hattrick is best with 4). However, it works quite well with any numbers between 3-6.

(Baker's Dozen) Cute cards and cute box. 5-card hand rule makes a game a bit less strategic but not too much. Also Baker's Dozen has 16 cards per suit instead of 14. You just have to play defensively! As a rule set, I prefer Poison.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(13) Themeless edition of Baker's Dozen (5-card hand) with the same card distributions of Poison (14 per suit). I really think that the game should be named 14 instead of 13 as 14 is the bad number and there are 14 cards in each suit. (Knizia does this sort of number matching all the time)

RATING: 7
I really like the art and gameplay, but one round per player is just too long for such a simple game.  I'd make it three rounds regardless of how many players there are, with the dealer for the second and third rounds being the player who scored the most points (points are bad) in the previous round.  Then, you'd have a good filler.

Solid Knizia. Light and will work well with Adult/Kid mixed group. Did I mention it was light?

RATING: 6
Perfectly acceptable entertainment.  A very accessible trick-taking(esque) card game where you need to decide early on whether you are going to take lots in a given color or none at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easy to teach but taxes your brain a little when playing it.  I just think it's not flexible enough for different kinds of strategy, in the sense that once you figure out "the way", you will win most of the time.

Update 1:  I think this is a game that evokes the "alright" feeling of a standard card game.  Doesn't have enough personality to make it ageless and with more people lasts much longer than the fun it provides.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I give it a solid "7."  Simple there's more to it than meets the eye, and it's tricky to win.  Typical Knizia game - my sixth!  UPDATE: Hasn't really stayed popular with our family.  Down to a 6.5.

At least, it is short. And there are no cardboard-cauldrons in the Amigo version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Light, press-your-luck, trick taking-ish game.  There are three pots where cards of various values are being played. If you play to one of them and put the card total over 3, you must take cards. Cards count against you, unless you have the most of a suit, then they are not counted. Need to watch what other players are taking since that will help you figure out what to take and what to avoid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It feels a lot like traditional card games. To me at least this is a good thing. You know all the cards in your hand at the beginning of the round and from there you either have to cleverly (or with some luck) avoid taking cards or aiming to have the most of one or more colors to score no (minus) points from that color(s). Rounds are played fast and the game is very simple but has enough depth to make it interesting to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple-to-learn game of trick taking, but with a twist. A great filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever little filler. I'd choose this any time over most trick-taking games, except maybe Flaschenteufel.

The Playroom box size is ridiculous, choose the Amigo edition instead. The Heidelberger/Iello edition has massive user interface issues, different card distribution, and other rule changes, so choose the Amigo edition instead.

Not a bad filler. The cauldrons are pointless and it seems a bit strange that players get different size hands, but it works out ok if you play as many rounds as there are players and rotate the dealer each time.

RATING: 9
Amusing game.  Can play a round here and there for filler, or the "proper" way (number of rounds equal to number of players) for slightly more strategy (making sure the winning players get more points!)  For some reason this game keeps growing on me over time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A typically-Knizia mathematical conversion of a traditional card game. Not as much charm as Escalation, therefore doomed to sit on the shelves in perpetuity.

[b]Poison[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i] Got to play this one again and really didn't like it. There is way too much randomness in the deal, you can get hosed by the cards you draw and there isn't a way to play your way out of it. I do not want to play this again, there are way too many superior card games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was the first trick taker of the night Mat introduced me to during our gaming meet up. Perfect game for Halloween Eve, we played the Poison version which had some cool cauldrons to play your cards on. This one reminded me a bit of [thing=56692][/thing] since you didn't score points if you had the most of a color.[/i]

This game is simple to play and fun! Great filler game! Set the red, blue, purple, or poison potions on each of one of the 3 cauldrons! When the cauldron total reaches 13 the pot is full and someone will have to take the cards! The person with the fewest points wins!

想辦法規劃牌讓中央接近爆炸，然後少拿牌就會贏

有時候會最後一張翻盤
規則:
*牌庫洗勻發牌發完，3人發4疊，其中一疊不會用到
*每次輪到你就出一張牌，中央三種牌分別有自己的牌堆，13號星期五可以出到任何一疊牌，當出牌後使的總合超過13則前面所有牌面向下放到自己面前，自己出的牌成為該堆起始牌
*所有玩家手牌出完記分，每個人計算三種牌的各別數量，單獨最多的棄掉全部該種牌，剩下的牌每張扣1，13號星期五扣2(一定棄不掉)
*遊戲在四輪後結束，扣分最少的獲勝

There's only so many times you can count to 13, and only so many times you can avoid having to play a card to stop a pile hitting the 13 count, and that limit is reached well before you hit the end of your first game unfortunately.

Neat simple trick taking game, were the final object is not the tricks themselves, but to minimize your negative points. Quick and simple, has some over the top crazy cauldron components and an over sized box, neither which are actually necessary to play the game, but are nice to have. Lastly, it has a good comic drawing of Dr. Knizia as a mad wizard on the cover. That alone makes up for any game flaws.

Immediately reminded me of another lightweight Knizia card game, Too Many Cooks.  Ultimately, this game was OK, but I think I prefer Too Many Cooks in this space.  And how about the overproduction on this game?!?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've played the game twice (once with 5 and once with 4 players), but it feels like I've played it a whole lot more than that due to each deal being the same.  Playing one deal per player with 4+ players makes for too long of a game for what this is.  Three deals would probably be a good number to play before playing something else.

There are a few interesting choices to make:
1. Do you try to avoid taking donuts entirely (I've seen people pull this off on occasion) versus gunning for the most donuts of 1 or 2 different types?
2. When do you switch to taking donuts from avoiding taking donuts, and visa versa?
3. When and where do you play the moldy donuts?

So in summary, there are a few interesting choices to make, but the game ends up being too long with higher player counts for this game to be the filler I want it to be.

--Nov2007-- Amusing little card game, vaguely similar to Too Many Cooks. This time, everyone shares the same objective function, but there are bonuses for collecting the most cards of a color.  It's fun enough, but insufficiently different (I think) from other games to demand a purchase.

I like trick-taking games, but Poison isn't as good as most classic trick-taking games. Even Hearts (with added Chinese rules) is a better version of this. I think my dislike stems from the fact that Poison places more emphasis than most on figuring out what your opponents have based on what they play in situations, but I dislike the doublethink. The card duplicates and multiple things going on also makes this a hard game to keep track of cards, which is central to enjoyment of a trick-taking game. Plus the game is really chaotic.

1+1

RATING: 7
Another quick little filler but Knizia, this one extremely over-produced.  The option to try to take the most in a given color is an interesting method of balancing out what could be otherwise poor hands.  Of course, you still have to watch out for poison cards.  The lack of these limits how much (to some extent) you can hurt your opponents.  But again, this is a filler and is over relatively quickly.  It's not grand strategy.  [01/08/2011]

Poison -- Played three through six players. 

Good filler.  The theme is purely cosmetic, but I find that I prefer the [i]Poison[/i] theme to the [i]Baker's Dozen[/i] theme, even though the idea of a "baker's dozen" ties the number 13 in so nicely.  Slipping poison into a cauldron just feels exactly as venomous as it should.

The distribution of the numbers on the cards combine with the limit of 13 total points per cauldron to make for engaging choices.

Over time, I've increased my rating for [i]Poison[/i] as I've realized what a reliable little game it is.

One caveat:  the game plays differently at three players because a dummy hand is dealt but not played, making the cards in play unpredictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very light, but some interesting gameplay.  I'd probably carry it around as a filler if it weren't so big. The suggested length of n rounds of play where n=number of players is a bit long, but 1 or 2 rounds is enjoyable.

Egy egyszerű, tipikus Knizia  kártyajáték. A játékosok 3 színben kevernek löttyöket, amikbe méreg is kerülhet. Ha egy színben 13 fölé megy az össz érték, akkor vinni kell az adott illetőnek a kártyákat. A játék végén, aki adott színből a legtöbbet vitte az nem ír, a többiek viszont laponként -1 pontot, minden méreg -2 pont. Igazából két fő taktika van. A sokat vivős és a semmit nem vivős. A sokat vivős a mérgek miatt szerintem jóval gyengébb, de rossz lapokkal nincs más esély. A lapok 1,2,4,5,7-es számozásúak, a mérgek 4-esek. A kétféle játékmód az összes lap kiosztása, illetve mindig 5 lapból játék. Az első esetlén kisebb ugyan a szerencse, de rossz lapból nem igazán lehet alkotni. Nekem ez az újfajta 5 lapból való játékszabály tetszett jobban. Engem nem győzött meg. Hárman kicsi hosszú is a 6 leosztás miatt, nagy a szerencse, nemcsak a lapok miatt, de itt az se mindegy milyen típusú játékos mögött ülünk. Vannak jóval jobb más kártyásak és Kniziák is.

well, this is a superb filler game.

CONS:
over produced which is a cheating con as its also a pro in my book :) OK, seriously, maybe it's not that good for those who hate counting but really - it's not like kingdoms "I need a calculator" counting type of game - it's very basic and actually great for kids to get into counting.

PROS:
fun, light and you can use various win strategies.

RATING: 6.5
This is a clever filler card game.  The system seems to boil down Too Many Cooks into a much more enjoyable and controlable experience. At the end of the day, it seems to pale in comparison the the brilliant elasticity of 6 Nimmt's design, and while it doesn't seem to compete with it at first, the more I think about how they mirror each other, the less I want to play this.

That said, I wouldn't turn it down.  It works just fine.

RATING: 8
Excellent game. Falls two points short of a perfect "10" only because of its 'light' weight. Good for 'drawing in' the non-gamer types because it can be brought out, explained and under way in less than five minutes. Led to a (somewhat) rousing discussion of the best way to play. Go for the most in any color or avoid taking cards altogether? Everyone wondered about the mathematical rationale for the card distribution - no 3s, no 6s; only two 4s in each color, not including the 4-point Poison cards. Presentation is a little ostentatious and as everyone seems to have noted, could well have been packaged as a simple deck of cards. The three cardboard cauldrons weigh more than everything else in the game and are totally superfluous. Still, a great game that will get out onto the table a lot. Suspicions here, as well, of some hidden depths to the game; of a search for optimum methodology that could serve veteran players well in games against newcomers. Not sure why it isn't labeled for two players, other than the fact that it might be hard to hold 25 cards in your hand. The 'most cards of a given color' issue might cancel itself out in a two-player, but then again, they might not. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not sure if this has any more/less strategy than Coloretto, but I like it a bit less. One of the reasons is that to play the full game, it probably takes three to four times as long and it just isn't the kind of warrant that length of play. I now have so many fillers that this isn't the first one to be played.

This is a cute filler where you deal all the cards (numbered 1-7) out (some people may end up with more cards). Then, take turns playing one at a time to the matching color row until the sun is > 13; if so, you claim the previously played cards. When all cards have been played, score each color:
- the player who took the most cards discards all of them.
- Everyone else score 1 penalty point per card remaining (or 2 for the wild cards). 

Shuffle all the cards and pass the deal left. The game ends after n rounds. The player with the fewest PP wins!

[1 play] It seemed like just a regular card game, only with special graphics and 3 black cauldrons.  It seems like the extra props are not really even needed for the game.  Some what overproduced.  The gameplay comes down to want to take some pots, not wanting to take others.  A decent card game filler, but I didn't find anything special in the play I had.  I would play it again, but won't be requesting it.

RATING: 6
[Playroom Entertainment 2005 edition] {Fantasy, Kid; mathematics; optimal 4-5p} Another Knizia's masterpiece of lightweight card game. Fun and tense. Besides, it's tactical card game allowing aggressive and defensive plays. The scoring system gives Poison life. Recommended as an entry card game.

The box is horribly larger than necessary. The 3 pots are attractive and effective; actually, the game experience will be worse without them. IMO, it's the most over-produced and over-priced game in my collection. (But it's still less over-produced than Buy Low Sell High.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Eh. It's not bad. It'd be a great game for teaching addition skills to kids. It's a pretty typical Knizia game (complete with one of a "If you have the most of this color you can throw yours out" rule) that feels an awful lot like 6 Nimmt! without the blind bidding (which is really the best part of 6 Nimmt!). Not bad for a short filler, and I'd happily suggest it for a children's game, but it didn't do much for me.

Another good Knizia filler cardgame. Easy to explain, quick to play. Low price despite wonderfully over-produced cauldrons in the Playroom version.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun, fast, and clever game.  It feels like a trick-taking game with the way you are trying to slough off cards and "poison" the points for the other players.  The cauldrons are nice to look at and add to the theme, but this game would be much more portable without them.  Kudos to Playroom Entertainment for improving the quality of their cards (as compared to David and Goliath).  See the 2-player variant rules in the forum.  One problem is that some players try to count the cards which is tricky given the clever card distribution.  I don't think this game is supposed to be analyzed to this extent (given the light theme) but there is something very clever about the card distribution so a player aid showing the card count would be helpful for serious players.  The game might go on a little long (one round per player) but I'll play this more before deciding.

Horribly overproduced.  Box to game ratio is like 115:1.

We own the Baker's Dozen version of this game.  This is another great Knizia game. It's a lot of fun, quick to play, and tailors well with young kids to adults. The game mechanic of gathering the least points by not taking too many donuts, especially the moldy ones, creates an enjoyable tension between players.  The outcome is always pleasantly unpredictable too.

It's actually well designed, the deck is well thought out. the theme actually supports the mechanic so you get the idea about taking poison cards. Downside: This game should have been developed into something more interesting. The scoring is extremely primitive (cards are worth 1 pt or 2 pts.) and there is not much that can be done in the way of risk/reward in order to catch up, such as in hearts where you can shoot the moon or spades where you bid nil. THe scoring is just too simple to hold my attention. 

On the plus side: it's an almost perfect filler game that can accommodate from 2-6 players, is easy to teach and offers some fun.  The game really does not break w/ more players we've  played several 6 player games that was fairly interesting. And it's very easy to teach, takes 3 min. 

It's playing time is perfectly right, about 5-10 min per hand and say 6 hands if you want to balance out the deals. But there are more interesting card games out there so it's hard to find a niche for it, other than as filler.

Card game involving playing different colored poison cards into the different cauldrons. If you play the card to put it over 13, you have to take the cards. Trick taking game where players don't want to take tricks. OK game, just not enough control when playing with 5 players. Probably plays best with 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light card game, good for a filler (especially between heavier fantasy games, thanks to Poison's alchemy theme). Nothing stunning here, but there are some tough choices to be had in the middle of a game (and be prepared to deal with some nasty no-win situations too!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Complex card management and timing wrapped up in a simple ruleset. Knowing how others play will tremendously help your game by allowing you to figure out when Pots will fill up. And once you can control the rate of Pots filling up, you can make sure they don't fill up before your turn.

Really a 4-6 player game (the 3-player game is a variant, and it's not good). Still haven't got to play with 4+ players yet, but it seems like this could be a fun little filler.

Update: Got to play with four finally. It's not a bad game at all, but there's a pretty high element of luck and I just have better light card games.

Poison is often a tedious and repetitious affair that may leave you frantically searching for an antidote before long.

Knizia took this concept to a whole new level in his game Too Many Cooks - which poisoned this experience for me.  Following one play of that,  I was through with this one faster than a minuteman on furlough.

If you like this concept at all, I suggest you give the above mentioned game a try.  To me,  at least, it is superior by leaps and bounds.  

Edit:  I was surprised to discover that Too Many Cooks was actually published three years prior to this game - probably because I was introduced to them in reverse order.  So,  in essence,  Poison is a stripped down version of that game.  It is also way more popular.  Go figure.

 Actually, there is some pretty nifty hand management and decisions to be had.  It takes some solid hand evaluation if you should A.  Try for no tricks(high risk high reward).  B.  Specialize in taking cards in one color(minimal risk minimal reward).  C.  Be a color taking machine(High risk, high reward)

Nice blend of risk management, and hand management in such a simple delightful card game.  Knizia has remade hearts.  Quite well done.  It plays quickly, has some luck, has some subtle skill.  Neat decisions, and interactive.

RATING: 3
This was just terrible, no good, and very bad. The worst of the bad bunch from October, beating out Maori and Ra: The Dice Game for the dishonor. I'd been wanting to try Poison for some time now as I'm a fan of many filler card games and a fan of various Knizia designs. Put the two together, and it turns out you get the worst of both worlds. One round of Poison consisted of being dealt a random hand of cards that entirely determined the outcome of that round as you simply played the obvious card on each turn to avoid taking negative points. One game of Poison consists of many completely unrelated rounds that do not build on each other or relate to each other in any way, as Knizia is wont to do. Adding rounds for the sake of length is a weak and half-hearted way to turn an idea into a full-length game. Poison was just utterly miserable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another interesting Knizia card game design, however not quite enough choice in this one to suit me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Poison is an older game that I'd never heard of before. It's a fairly simple game. There are three suits with numbers 1-7 (with no 6's or 3's) and some poison cards. Each suit has a pile that you play to. When you play a card such that the pile exceeds 13 you take the cards that were already there, leaving the card just played. At game end you discard any cards in a suit if you are the player who has the most of that suit. Each card is worth 1 point against you and the poison cards count double.

I liked this game. It's fairly quick and light, so a good filler. I especially like the artwork on the cards. The game comes with three humongous cardboard cauldrons which are totally not needed. And it's a game that could fit in a standard card deck box but instead uses a box twenty times too big. And while the artwork on the cards is really nice, the cover is super cheesy.

It apparently has been redone as Friday the 13th with artwork I really didn't like.

Light weight filler and as such, play sparingly when required.

Another Knizia mechanic that has a twist in the final scoring. I like the lightness of the game. I own Baker's Dozen, but hate the shuffling of round cards.It is not easy. Probably enjoy Poison a lot more and the theme behind it. Still, but 3-4 rounds, it is quick and a good filler.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game at all, and very nicely produced.  It is alot like 6 Nimmt (Category 5).  One interesting difference is that having the most of a color means you don't score that color, and you are shooting for lowest score.  That adds some strategy to the game.  It is easier to judge what you need to do from your initial hand, so it is a little less chaotic than 6 Nimmt.  I'm on the fence about if that is an improvement, though.  For me, though, the simultaneous card selection of 6 Nimmt puts it over the top.  Smultaneous play and filler games go together very well.

It's a little random, but so short that it's not much of an issue.  It's a weird blend of Too Many Cooks and 6 Nimmt!, and the fact that a player can discard all cards of a given color if he or she has the most gives the game a nice balance.  My biggest complaint, though, is that the cauldron tiles are completely superfluous, and only add to the price of the game.  That, and it seems that seat order plays a big role in who collects the most cards in each round.

The mad doctor has cooked up something evil in Reiner Knizia's Poison, a clever strategy card game. Players choose a potion card from their hand to add to one of three colored cauldrons, being careful not to let the pot go over a total value of 13.
\13\\13\
The player who causes the cauldron to go over 13 must take all of the cards within it, trying to avoid taking a potion mixed with poison.
\13\\13\
Be the player with either the most or none of any potion and you're safe - otherwise take the risk of receiving a deadly dose!

This is one of my favorite filler games.  I like the way your strategy can shift from avoiding collecting a color to collecting the most of the color so you can avoid counting those points at all.

This turned out to be a pretty fun and light game. It was enjoyable and I think I will enjoy playing this one when there's not a lot of time to play. Though I do want to play this with a large group. What I didn't like was the uneven hand amount in a 3-4 player game. I did play 3 players with the fourth hand being a 4th player no use hand. But I could see how the third player to go would have a slight disadvantage so maybe it works out that the latter players don't have as many cards in hand to begin with.

One of my favorite card games.  All cards are dealt out.  Then players discard potion cards into cauldrons.  the cauldrons can only hold so much potion.  The player that makes a cauldron overflow takes all the cards in the cauldron.  After all cards a played, the player with the most cards of a color gets to discard all of those cards.  Then everyone scores point for the remaining cards.  Beware the poison cards which are worth double points and cannot be discarded like the other potion cards.

Poison is probably the best family, mathematics-based cardgame with a paper-thin theme I have seen. This little beauty is easy to teach and comes out at virtually every games night we have, even if it's just the final game of the evening. That is a high recommendation.

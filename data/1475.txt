RATING: 5
Despite the prosaic name (very off-putting when you're 12) this is a reasonable game and the first time I encountered different win conditions for different players. However, these different win conditions are perhaps too different and lead to the feeling that you're playing different games on the same board.

There are some decisions to be made, which lifts this above the average roll and move game, but then again, I didn't much care for this when I was a kid, so it loses a point or two there.

RATING: 6
As a family game and taken as a depiction of the 1960s when the game was made, this game is pretty amusing. Not often do you find it possible to mine for uranium in a game and manage to blow yourself up in a spaceship.

Years ago, I found this game in my grandmother's attic.  I don't remember much about the game itself, but I do remember enjoying it so much that my grandmother gave it to me at the end of my visit.  I have no idea where my copy now is, but I would like to find it to see whether it has stood the test of time.

Old 50`s style board game. My mom and dad used to play this and other Waddington games with friends. Mom and Dad gave me there copy in May 2012, along with Buccaneer and Kimbo, two other games from their youth. I can remember them playing these games with visitors after dinner parties in the 1960`s. Many many plays as a teenager and child. Charles has just re-discovered it after mom and dad have given it to me. Better than Monopoly.

Hard to imagine a better roll and move game. It's only taken other games 50 years to catch up with this (variable hidden victory conditions and player control of movement). Why did it take me so long to finally get a copy?

This is a throwback to my childhood days, and that's where it will remain.  I did like the secret goals that you could create at the beginning of the game, but overall this is still a light kid's game.  I always preferred being a celebrity athlete and winning with loads of cash.

My parents had this when I was young, but rarely played it. I was fascinated with it (something to do with earning hearts and stars, probably).

This is the first game i think to allow you to select your own victory conditions. Very innovative, and funny. It also felt like you were making real decisions which was unusual for a roll and move game.

RATING: 9
I adore this game, but some of that is nostalgia.  Still, this one was way ahead of its time... and it holds up quite nicely.  NOTE: My '9' rating is for the original (pre-1971) game only (the board with the Uranium Prospecting track).  When they updated the various careers and event language, they actually changed the game - and for the worse.

I used to enjoy this game as a kid... but it lacks the depth to be a fun game for me as an adult. Interesting mechanic, and better than your average roll-and-move, but not quite sophisticated or skillful enough to keep my attention nowadays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the different adventures one can have in this game, though my ideals of what is important in life have changed to no longer be compatible with this game, it is still fun.  Certainly teaches that we make decisions that affect our future, and that our future can be determined by ourselves, and also by other events out of our control.  Too philosophical?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Takes the next step over the old roll-and-move games.  The special movement cards are an excellent addition, and the game is quite enjoyable.  It's also really cool that you can set your own victory conditions, and make strategic moves in order to reach them.  There is a great deal of dice-rolling that can have a lot of control over who wins and who loses, but it's still a step up from games like Life and Monopoly.

This is a nostalgia choice.  Every once in a while I get the urge to play this because I enjoyed it as a kid, but after that play I don't need to touch it again for six months.  It's kind of like eating at White Castle: tastes great at first, but gives indigestion.

Holds the record for me with 12 hours of continuous play in one day. as each game only take 20-40 min. that's a whole lot of games in one session.

If you asked me to play right now i would not say no. a near perfect game in my mind.

Got one for just $0.75!

I really did enjoy my first game considering what this game is and its age but my wife didn't feel the same as she did get some incredibly bad luck with the dice. Still it's a game I want to keep on the shelf to play again as it's the most fun I've ever had with a roll and move game.

Edit: Well it never got to being played again, so off to auction it went...

We played this game as a family for YEARS and it never got old... good challenge for both kids and parents.  There was a reprint in the 80s or 90s which dumbed the game down and made it suck.  The original version is a fantastic family game.  Meet normal requirements.  May save or sell.

This is a great game that was my mom's when she was younger. The box is falling apart, but we still pull it out once in a while to play. My version is dated 1965. As such it is a pretty gender-biased game with squares like "Shopping Spree: Throw 1 die to find out what your wife just spent on shopping spree". I don't really mind, and neither have any of the women that I've played with... it is always fun for a "blast from the past". I have three copies now, each from a different era.

Although this is a typcial "Roll and Move" type of game (which can be vilified on the Geek at times), there is actually a lot of fun to it.  I like the fact that a player can choose their own victory conditions, which adds an enjoyable variation to the game each time it is played.  This is a game that can be brought out every so often, and will compete with my other "family" games for playing time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For an old game, this had the fantastic mechanic of allowing a player to choose their own victory conditions.  For me this is one of the "big three" among board games when I was a kid; the others being "Life" & "Monopoly".

The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is that it has an interesting mechanic: player's choose their victory conditions and keep it secret from other players.  Too bad this mechanic was matched to a completely pointless and lame "role and move" game.

There are actually (at least) two versions of this game.  The &quot;new&quot; one I remember buying 20 years ago and being dissapointed because it wasn&#039;t as interesting as the &quot;old&quot; one my uncle had, which had a more varied board and paths.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a gem among old-school games.  It is never the same twice and there are alot of fun squares.  You have alot more options than most roll and move games.  I almost always lose and yet I enjoy it.  It takes a couple hours to play (up to 100 points), but the time always goes quickly.  I like the original version where you can become a uranium prospector or go to the moon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mom and dad found an old one at an antique store.  It's pretty fun, partially dependent on the rolls of the dice, but not totally.  We make it more fun by not just saying "Pose for Calendar, 2 stars" but we make each other show us the pose.  Great silliness.  Plus, everyone is going for their own secret outcome that they keep track of.

For an old system, it has the fun aspect of allowing you to decide your own victory conditions.  Its also fun to read the comments on the spaces - we&#039;ve come a long way!

Not awful for an old-school roll and move game. Given the date it was published, the mechanic where you decide your own winning conditions is quite an innovation. But overall, boring game.

Wow. The best out of the non-abstract pre-classical games out there (so excludes games like Go, Chess, Dominos and Checkers). I love the fact that you get to decide your own win conditions (within a given set of rules). Plus, reading the spaces and effects when people were going through various Careers were cute and somewhat exciting. I will definately purchase and play this one with my kids (once I marry, settle down and have them). For now, I'm content to rate it highly on my BGG rankings.

Good fun.

There is enough choices in the game to allow for strategies to develop. It can be a little too easy if attempting to play optimally (Go for happiness, then head to sport).

I have played an older version which has a couple more 'career' paths, which appears slightly more balanced.

Ample opportunity to screw other people over.

My girlfriend likes it and that makes me happy. We play without the Take That element of sending people to the Park Bench if you land on them. It allows everyone to make their own path and live out their dreams of going to the moon or being a farmer. I like it quite a bit and the nostalgia element with the older board makes people happy.

What I didn't like:
* Very luck heavy
* Certain career paths and conditions are a lot better than others making the others pointless

I played a lot when I was a kid growing up. I enjoyed the game as a kid, but I won't be playing again as an adult unless to spend time with niece's and nephew's etc. Or possibly some non-gamers. If so, they should have a copy of the game in question. I don't have my own copy since I switch from American board games to euro board games.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

[countless plays] A much-underappreciated game, and probably the greatest of all my childhood favorites.

I raised my rating of this from 5 to 7. It just occured to me that my wife and I spent many a Saturday evening  playing this game with friends and enjoying it. We created a variant of our own by taking a deck of cards on which we wrote different point values for winning. (so many hearts, so many stars, so many dollars) Each card was different. Each player chose a card and that what was what he or she had to accomplish in order to win. With 52 posibilities of different victory conditions you never knew what strategy you might need in order to win until you began the game.

Not a bad family board game...  some of the rules make little to no sense, but there are some mechanics that are unexpected for a family-type game, like choosing your own victory conditions at the beginning of the game.

Comments for the pre-1970s version. This is a surprisingly good and fun game. It has several Euro-ish elements to it such as individual and variable victory conditions, trading between players, significant choices, and a built in acceleration mechanic. Plus, it's just plain fun. What other game allows you to conquer Hollywood, fly to the moon, then settle down for some farming?

Fun. Highly underrated. Ahead of its time. See Larry Levy's excellent review. Brilliant mechanic of secretly choosing your goal before the game starts. Would be even better with a bit less luck. But don't underestimate Careers' tactical options. Garnering cards ("move X spaces") and using them at the right time often wins the game. One flaw is that money is too important and too easy to get compared to fame and happiness.

This is an early "Ameri-trash" game.  It has a then unique idea, that of setting your own victory conditions.  That being said, after a few plays it is fairly obvious which victory conditions are easier to achieve than others.  The game is a classic, and playable for nostolgic reasons.  

The game is now dated, the differing careers have many obsolete or pase aspects, and is actually a little funny compared to today.

An old roll-and-move that somehow feels okay to play? Could be because you can choose your own victory conditions (the spread of how much money, fame, and happiness you need to win) before the game starts. As it is a roll-and-move, you can't really plan but this plus the use of the occasional card to guarantee a particular movement makes it... okay to play when someone is feeling nostalgic? Oh and it plays under an hour.

This was my favorite board game when I was a little kid.  I played countless games with six of my stuffed animals, each of whom had a favorite success formula.  I had the 1971 edition.

This was one of my favorite games as a kid. I think because of the type pf opportunities it presented rather than the Game of Life where you were destined to be married and have kids.

Another game I loved as a kid.  It was actually strangely educational.  While the details of the game are wildly off from reality, it did get the idea across to me that I needed to choose a career.

Fond memories - a late comer to our family so I was already "too grown up" for board games with my younger siblings, but this was a neat game, what with setting own goals for VP conditions and the experience cards to be used instead of die rolls.

Would play again, even today, especially with pre-teens as gateway to introduce them to more modern games.

RATING: 6
Classic game from my childhood, with many fond memories.  It is a much better game than most of the roll and move games of that era, mostly because it offers more choices.  You get to pick your victory conditions before the game starts and then tailor your career path to meet the goals you set.  However, it is still a roll and move game (with choices), so stay away if you don't like dice.

RATING: 6
Old school roll and move game from my youth. May still have a copy somewhere in my Dad's house, heaven knows what state it's in!

What would now be called 'hidden victory conditions' make an early appearance here, in that each player secretly decides in advance what proportions of the 60 points needed to win you will get from happiness, fame and money. After that it's pretty much roll lucky and horde the cards that allow you to move a certain number of spaces forward in lieu of rolling the dice as they can move you onto the spaces that will give you the points you need.

RATING: 6
One of the games that I grew up with.  It's changed over the years (they've replaced [i]Farming[/i] with [i]Sports[/i] for example), but the game still captivates.

I think that it's the fact that each player sets his own victory conditions that make it better than other roll-and-move games from the 50s.  Still a solid '6' rating.

As a child, I loved this game. I loved how you get to make your own winning conditions and therefore choose your strategy and try to see it through. If you have some basic probability and statistics skills trying to find the "perfect" scoring combination can be quite a fun strategic challenge. I think this was my "gate-way" game to Euro-style gaming, particularly the Stefan Feld kind of games.

If you want a roll-and-move game that feels classic but has more theme to it than Life and more interesting choices than Life or Monopoly...here you go.

It also mitigates the luck of roll-and-move quite a bit in good ways.

Very classic 60s feel to it.  We've had a lot of fun playing this game.  You have a little bit of roleplaying feel to it to, with all the events that can happen to you, we find ourselves telling little stories jokingly when weird combinations of events happen to the same person.

Childhood game that stood out to me for a few reasons.  One, money isn't everything.  Two, you get to pick your own victory conditions.  And three, you get to pick different paths, something forbidden by Monopoly or Life.  That's why I still keep this one.

Almost a nice theme, but becomes an obsolete grinding exercise in dice rolling.  Not really that fun.  Takes too long, and fails to deliver.

RATING: 6
I like this game, and as a "roll and move" game, it's great. As a strategy game...not as great as people keep saying. First, I'll get the props for "pick your endgame" innovation. Ok, but does it really impact gameplay? No. It doesn't because whatever goals you have, you plan for - whether they were pre-set, you chose them, or someone else chose them. So, you're still planning just the same.

Next, the cards. Yes, they are fun and reduce dice luck. Ok, but since everyone has that, does it change things enough? Not really. And you don't have infinite cards, so you're still rolling a lot. 

Can you really have a "winning strategy"? No. Park Bench takes care of that when the dice don't.Larry mentions that in his great review, but I believe understates it's importance.

Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride have preset goals, but vary completely in how each player may try and get there. But what's the real difference - in those games you can affect the other players! That is completely missed in Careers, except Park Bench. Again, this is a simple boardgame, not real strategy. 

My point is not to knock the game, I love it. But rather to subdue a few zealous people. Again, more strategy that normal roll and move boardgames, but not as much as true strategy game. This makes it great for everyone to play. 

Though I do agree with all others that post 1965 the versions were lame. And there were a few rule changes for the worse.

A roll-and-move game that's not as brainless as many of the others.  It sort of has a pick-up-and deliver mechanic as you need to earn specific things in order to go down certain routes.

Total crap game. Takes many aspects of Monopoly and Life, but somehow manages to be worse than both. It's no wonder that this game has faded into obscurity, as it really doesn't hold up well at all. I do like the deck of cards that provides players with ways to mitigate the dice, but these are difficult enough to get that they don't make that big of a difference. I'm not sure what this game is trying to simulate, but if it's a snooze-fest, it succeeded.

Monopoly but with options.  Sure, game is luck based, but I will always hold a warm spot for this game in my heart.  

In Careers you decide what you need to focus on to win the game; fame, money, or happiness.  Old friends of mine used to play games to 300 instead of 60 so we could play all day.

RATING: 4
A simple roll, move, and gather things type of game that at least has some saving graces. You set your own balance of winning conditions (between hearts, stars and money), which feeds into your decisions about which inner paths to take - they all offer different balances of the resources. The game also offers up a bunch of cards to allow you to manipulate your moves so you're not as reliant on the dice. Still, there's huge luck in the cards and the dice which means the game's main (only?) attraction is theme appeal with the kids.

This game was a revelation to me when I played it in my early teens. With the ability to choose career paths and the ability to use experience cards in place of die rolls, it opened up a multitude of in-game choices that straightforward roll and move games lacked. While my rating may be a bit high, I felt I had to give it a seven simply because it rekindled my interest in board games.

Although not a *great* game, it's a steady favorite that I've played and enjoyed since I was a kid, and still do. Your choices are limited at the beginning of the game, and luck matters more, but over time you gain more control and get to choose from a much larger number of options. Compares favorably to many newer games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Good game for friendly competition, as you're competing mainly against the game, not other players.  We use playing cards to determine success formulas.  Nearly 50 years old, still holds up well.

RATING: 7
The Game of Life's better half.  Careers was a great game and I loved the way you set your own conditions for winning  The individual career choice tracks deviated enough  from the main track to keep things fresh.  A good family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's old and I've been playing it for ages, but it's actually quite fun for a "roll dice and run around the board" game. I relish the element of control you have over the game, especially being able to choose your own victory conditions! I find that unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty good for a 1950s roll and move. Some nice mechanics (reward cards that replace the dice with a set move) and setting your goals give you something to think about - and nothing better than hitting a $5000 jack pot. But in the end, it is a roll and move, and my interest wandered towards the end.

I almost gave this a 5, because the game is harmless enough and my willingness to play (despite how bad this game is) isn't that low. But that probably has something to do with the fact that, in my one play, I absolutely demolished the competition. The decision-making in this game is really rudimentary. Practically all luck. Roll-and-move. I really see no reason to play this again.

Used to like this game when I was young and wasn't used to games other than Monopoly. It's a bit shorter than Monopoly, so when you're on the loosing side, you don't have to suffer a long time. It lost its appeal when it was clear that going for the moon was the winning strategy. Haven't really touched it for years now.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played this game a lot in 60's and 70's. Really enjoyed creating my own winning conditions. The game is not as much luck driven as one would think. Start the game rolling the dice. But as the game progresses you build your hand up with the Experience and Oppurtunity cards and start to control exactly where you want to go. Of course I still use the original game rules. I ignore the simplified 1979 rule set. Still a good game to pull out occassionally.

I didn't play it too often as a kid. But I found the choosing of victory conditions very exciting. I think that that sort of victory condition could be used in many modern games to avoid the kingmaker syndrome. Unfortunately apart from that there was not much fun for the rest of the game.

Careers has aged better than a lot of old roll and move games (this game should still be in print instead of Monopoly). And it's really unique how you can choose your victory conditions at the beginning of the game. But it could use some tweaks to bring it more in line with modern game design.

I dug it out of a box, but he had already found one, so now I get to keep it.  Maybe I'll play again someday.

A good choice as far as roll and move games go. You set your own victory conditions so you can pursue different strategies. However, like all roll and move games that I've played, there is the potential that you will be waiting for the dice to give someone the victory. The longer this takes, the less likely you are to play ever again.

This is a dungeon crawl game made most mundane.  There are some really nice ideas here for 1955, as you build up your character's xps.  It was certainly an innovator and as the game progresses you start to get a little more control, but spaces that say things like "lose all your fame" make it near intollerable.

This is, across generations, by far and away the most popular game across our family, across 4 generations. It is mostly just a roll-the-dice kind of affair, but with such a gorgeous caught-in-time air, and a faint whiff of 50s moralism. I get more pleasure from landing on "you've raised a prize bull, have 4 points of happiness" than I do from any number of more strategic games in their entirety!

been playing this since about 9 years old and now I play it with my daughter. we never get tired of this at least one game, and we have developed the nasty cutthroat side of this game with landing on and sending one another to unemployment. The game is interesting as it starts out as randomness and ends with deterministic calculations; a really interesting family board game. (nov '14)

RATING: 6.5
There are a lot of neat aspects to this game that make it work.  Setting your own winning formula, gaining skill points to help influence your movement at crucial moments, living a wild fantasy career path mixed with the nostalgic charm of a game created in an era where it was possible to find gold on the moon, all makes for one enjoyable experience.  game is out of print, but if you can find a copy, get it, it will be worth your while.

I like that you can choose your own victory conditions, and that these are secret.  All the small paths inside the game board give you lots of options.  Plus I love the Careers you can choose from in the version I have - Uranium Prospecting and Go To The Moon...!!!

As teens most games we have in Hong Kong are roll and move type – Flying Chess (Chinese Parcheesi), Snakes & Ladder, & Monopoly.  “Careers” was actually among the best of this lot.  Yes, it has few player interactions; but the variable victory conditions give every player a different strategic direction. After some dice-rolling to complete some careers tracks you get experience cards, and then the real game begins. The experience cards is just that, it represent your gain in experience with your previous jobs, so that you have more control of your subsequent jobs by playing cards for moving to the exact space instead of dice roll.  It turns the whole game from a mindless race into to tactical game under the full control of the players.  It is a great family game that capture the flow of building careers for whatever goal you choose, much more so than A Game of Life.

RATING: 8.8
Rating is for original release only.  Subtract 1.5 for seventies release and -5 for subsequent 'improvements'.

Much more than a 'roll-and-move' luckfest.  Once players have had a few moves, several options are generally available on any given turn. In fact luck decreases the longer the game goes on, as nasty squares can generally be avoided (and favorable squares landed on) by the judicious use of acquired 'experience' cards.  

A childhood favorite which still stands up today. The rating this game gets around here is ridiculous and must surely be a consequence of more members being exposed to the later retarded releases.

I owned this one as a kid and it was the first game to expand on the Monopoly theme for me.  The idea of deciding my own win conditions was amazing to me.  It introduce a bit of resource management to me and for that I'm eternally greatful, glad I found a copy of it for nostalgia purposes.

UPDATE: Sitting around the house and kind of restless. Had played several games and wanted to something...a bit different. A group of friends had been talking about this game and I'm on the hook to bring it so with the family wanting something to play we pulled out Careers. This game DEFINITELY still stands on it's own. I'm going to write a review on this gem so I hope you read that and dust off your copy or go find one for CHEAPNESS it will be enjoyed.

One of my mom's old games.  Lots of fun.  Sort of a twist on the Game of  Life with a Monopoly style board.  Lets you choose a game goal (life goal) balance between fame, fortune and happiness.  You can easily adjust the length of each game by increasing or decreasing the sum total of all (Fame, Fortune, Happiness).  30 points in a normal game.

Careers is a game where the players set their own victory conditions. A player may choose to pursue Fame, Happiness, Money, or a combination of all three. The limitation being that the total number of "points" earned in the 3 categories must total 60. eg. 60 Happiness, 0 Fame, 0 Money; 20 of each; or any other combination. The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different "occupation paths". All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once. The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while "Going to Sea" is good for happiness. In the end it is the player (or team of players) who gets to their pre-set goal first who will be the winner, and achieve everything they ever wanted in life.

An innovative game in its time (victory formulas and savable bonus cards to affect roll & move) that still holds up reasonably well for what it is.

Probably the best and most innovative of the old roll-and-move children's games- I would really like to see the specialization of the tracks and the secret success formula ported to an up-to-date design.  Also, the Experience Cards which let you replace die rolls with specific, controlled moves are another excellent way of giving people a sense of control and strategy.  *Still* an excellent family game after all these decades.

Also, in one of the old editions, you can go Uranium Prospecting- in Peru!  Is that not awesome?

Classic from my youth. We had fun playing this at the time. Another roll & move but there are a few decisions to make here and there, which place it above others of its era - the formula for success mechanic was pretty cool. Not a game I would ever long to play again - but I also don't think I'd refuse a to play a game if it was offered.

When you compare this game to either Life or Monopoly, you'll find that this is a game with a few more choices than either of those games, but not quite as many as you might want out of the newer crop of games.  The self-selected win conditions are pretty cool, and what you pick determines how you play the board, and the use of the cards for movement means you don't always have to rely on the luck of the dice every turn.  There are definitely tactics to use to play the game, such as building up a good income before getting into too many career paths, and using the opportunity cards to jet around the board and pass pay day, but there's still a lot of luck in how the game plays out.

It's also a very punishing game, as the longer you stay on the outside of the board, the more you risk having to pay a lot of money or lose a lot of turns.  The bumping rule is a bit annoying, too, but it might depend on your group as to how bad it can be.

Definitely better than a lot of other classic "family" games, but you still don't have enough control for my taste. If you go a few times around the board without getting any cards, it's hard not to get frustrated when your opponents are jetting to spaces at will.

The luck factor is high with the dice roll, offset a bit by the experience cards.

I don't think this game gets enough love. I think it gets lumped into the same bin as Monopoly and Life and Trouble and Sorry as "one of those 1950s era games" and ignored. And yet, it's what I used to introduce my kids to board games. It made the most sense as it was a game that allowed the player to set his or her own win conditions. I still like to play it even today. If anything it can be viewed as a great filler, especially if one goes from something like Careers to Lords of Vegas. :-)

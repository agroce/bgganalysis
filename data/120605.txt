I really think this game can, and will, run out of gas fairly quickly.  I am also confident that such a time is at least 20 plays away for my son and I.  And I suspect each of those 20 plays will be as much fun as the first 3 were.  

My rating is based on those 20+ plays.  I think until this game does go stale, it is fantastic! Extremely fun game and battle.  I can't wait to play it again!!!

Moloch forces are heading toward New York to raze the city. This will end the resistance of the people and eventually break their defense lines. A swarm of steel-gray machines marches to the east, destroying everything in its path. Day after day, the horizon is decorated with new pillars of smoke. Fire will soon visit the place that used to be called New York.

Interesting 2-player combat game, love the theme, and it manages to maintain a lot of the "set-up and let-loose" feel of Neuroshima Hex, another game I love. I wonder if this will hold up to lots of repeated play, but right now I am loving it.

2 player, very asymmetrical game. One player is the forces of good trying to get their convoy through the location spaces on the board. The other player are the aliens who are trying to stop them. I really love the conflict resolution in this one. It can get a little complicated with timing and some of the symbology, but not too much. Try this if you're looking for a meatier 2 player experience.

Very AP prone. You wouldn't guess it by how the game looks, but it can take a lot of thought to decide on your next move. Games can take over an hour. It takes much more concentration to do a good job playing as the humans than as the aliens, so it's very unbalanced in that respect.

At its heart it is war. Play cards...highest sum wins. But this game adds many choices by letting players, play as many cards as they want before the next player plays. Then decide the contested area and either repel the attack or move one closer to New York.

I never had the desire to play again.

TRADED IT! (For 10 Days in USA replacement copy)

The Battle Line mechanic is nothing new for 2 player games, though having asymmetrical decks and win conditions sets this one apart.

The win condition portion of the game is what I disliked. You basically do all this meaningless posturing and hand "set up" for the final few turns of the game, where the whole thing switches from having the higher strength total on your side, to having to kill all the enemy robots in the final city. It just comes off clunky.

Muy buen juego para dos que mantiene la tensión durante la horita que dura la partida. Tiene sinrgias muy chulas entre las cartas y los objetivos asimétricos para ambos jugadores también son interesantes. Lo estuvimos jugando de seguido Juan y yo pero nos estancamos cuando vimos que la facción Outpost (humanos) es invencible si se juega adecuadamente. Lo tenemos en reposo para darle más adelante con energías renovadas. Muy recomendable.

This game is an interesting bundle of contradictions.  

Cheap, portable, with trashy art... but it's in fact a very thinkey, surprisingly deep, tactical card game.

Wordy & complicated rulebook... but the game mechanics are, once digested, actually quite simple.

The learning curve for the iconography is lighter than something like Race for the Galaxy... but only if you play the game regularly.  Otherwise, you'll be looking at the codex.

I like it, but it's definitely one of the odd birds in my collection.

Finally! Ignacy Trzewiczek created elegant and simple (in terms of rules) game! 
 
The artwork on city cards and flavor text is AWFUL! Bluh! 
 
Both sides play COMPLETELY different - as Moloch you just walk and smash whatever you want (almost), and the Outpost is still maneuvering, moving from here to there - definitely much more to think for the ,,green side". 
I'm not sure if best strategy for Moloch isn't just to leave the most powerful cards for NY and keep winning at least only the battles that let him kill enemies soldiers. 
Nevertheless - worth digging up the strategies in this one. 
I think I'm going to pick it up.

Rating dicreased. Luck of the draw REALLY does matter. Anyhow - I really like it. :)

While "Revolver" couldn't convince me, it was much more accessible than this one. Yeah, you may have to think more about the cards you play, but since the cards have completely different impacts, it feels somewhat random.

RATING: 7
Not bad at all. Strictly two player, with a nice narrative & two pretty asymetrical factions.
The cards aren't complicated, so with your second game both players should know what they're doing.
Sure the strategies are more or less straight forward but they can differ enough to keep it interesting.. i think.

Oh Artwork and theme help too..

From what i heard this new edition has text instead of symbols wich makes gameplay much easier, without constant rulebook referencing..

This is a lot like Revolver: a two-player game with cards that that have different powers, and players must establish dominance in a number of fields in a specific order.

This comment is for the Neuroshima: Convoy edition.

2016-06-23

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2016)

I bought the game a long time ago because I really like Neuroshima Hex!, however my desire to play it was rather low. It took me 3 years to play it and I ended up disappointed.

The game IS very simple at its core (you can teach it under 7 minutes), but as each player has 35 cards and many of them are unique, the gameplay is very slow at first. The speed would be improved with repeat plays, but the first one wasn’t very fun or fast. In my only play Outpost won easily, so I feel it is easier to win with them, however I don’t have enough plays to verify this claim AND I have seen other players to claim just the opposite. To verify this I would need to play the game again and that’s not something I want to do with my limited gaming time. Having saying that, I feel the game is very repetitive and one dimensional, the replay value must be low. I’m sure the game is more deep than it appears initially, but I don’t see any motivation to explore it further.

The theme is great, but, other than the art, you don’t feel much of it through the game which is a HUGE disappointment. The art is also ok.

I have both editions of the game, but we decided to play the latest one because it has text on the cards. I think the previous edition used only icons to make the game language independent but I’m not 100% sure. The language poll on BGG´s page is surely misleading and that’s the reason I have both editions of the game, I thought the third edition was language independent and I bought it for a friend who doesn’t speak English. This is a minor quibble for me, but changing this between editions can confuse some geeks like me.

If the idea was to make a better Revolver, the goal was accomplished, however Neuroshima: Convoy is not a good game for me.

Bottom line, Neuroshima: Convoy is very boring for me. I will sell both of my copies and I don’t want to play it again.

Ok game, a little like Revolver, but with some very interesting extra abilities. This would be an awesome game if it wasn't an autowin for the Molochs unless they are very very unlucky with their card draws while the outpost player is very lucky with his. An expansion might change the balance. Well it is fun, it just feels a little deterministic, and is more about how little you loose as the outpost, more than to see who wins.

I am a huge fan of The New Era and Neuroshima Hex and have been looking forward to this one for some time. It’s an asymmetrical 2-player game in which the scrappy human fighters must take down an unstoppable legion of killer robots. The rulebook is intimidating, but it turns out it’s not as complicated as it might seem. I played Moloch and Matt played Outpost and I won pretty solidly. I started out strong and Matt came back some towards the end, but we both felt like he just had no chance the whole time. It’s likely he just had a weird draw of the cards (plus the usual first game, not really knowing exactly what’s out there and how to manage it). The second time we played (playing the same sides), Matt won, so I think that first game largely came down to unfamiliarity and weird card draws. It’s a neat game, and I’m eager to give it more chances. Incidentally, I posted [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=7644]this bit of foolishness[/url] about the game a while back.

An interesting game that reminds me of the Battleline/Pecking Order type of games.  Moloch seems much easier to figure out the strategy for than Outpost.  The mix of luck and strategy is somewhat similar to Neuroshima Hex--you know all the cards you will draw (except for the discards), you just don't know when you will draw them.

I’m not sure whether I should give a rating to this one at all, since I’m pretty sure I must have missed something in my one play of it. Given how much I like Neuroshima Hex, the suspicion that the fault lies with me and not the game is even stronger. But for what it’s worth, this felt like much ado about nothing: a lot of rather fiddly actions and counteractions hiding the core decision of where to hedge your bets and where to go all in.

My biggest gripe, and one that will probably keep me off this game for good, is the ability of the human side to completely neuterize their opponents in one of the cities with one of their buildings. Placing this in the final battle for New York might not be a good way to win, but it sure is an excellent way to have a horribly anti-climatic end to the game.

Played my first game as Outpost and won!

I've had my eye on this for the longest time as I'm a big fan of Neuroshima Hex. Turns out this is not Neuroshima Hex: the cardgame, but it is a pretty good a-symmetrical cardgame anyway.

This being a Portal game, I feared that I would need many readings from the rulebook before I would be able to play. Turns out this is by far the best Portal rulebook I've read. There are only a few minor niggles like the card descriptions could've been written in alphabetical order, the + tokens and - tokens are not that distinguishable from each other and the cards could have used a little designator to indicate how many copies are in the deck. Other than that: good job, Portal!

Molochs Robots vs. Outpost Soldiers in a somewhat asynchronous game of card skirmishes. The Moloch's goal is to destroy New York city while the soldiers are trying to stop them by defeating all the robots before then (by getting rid of their deck and any active robots). For first timers the Molochs are very hard to defeat.

A very difficult confrontation game but I like the way it works.

Each army is very asymmetric and has a very different gameplay. Actually, this game is a "never played before" game for me as I think it is special.

Outpost are weak and should move all the time to get bonus from empty cities (this is something few players do) and never leave any opportunity to Molochs.

Molochs should never keep a empty city preventing Outpost to get bonus and should bluff a lot to make the Outpost player afraid of his potential modules.

My advise is to read and understand every unit card before start a game. This help a lot to understand how armies should be played and avoid to get back too much in the rulebook.

A somewhat inferior version of the Revolver series, but this takes place in the post-apocalyptic wastelands of Neuroshima. Convoy and Revolver are so close that you could almost consider them variants of each other, but I prefer Revolver because of a few reasons. First off, as is usually the case for Portal, there are numerous rule ambiguities. Not to mention a pretty poorly-written rule book as well. It also feels like there are a few really powerful cards on each side, and as soon as you can get those out, the game is really going to swing to your side. I don't necessarily dislike this game, but it's not one I'll want to play over Revolver unless I want something with this theme. Even then, this probably isn't a keeper.

Not bad at all. Can be tense and

but once you have it down it's a solid game.
I dig the theme and the two factions are

Quite violent in the effects, and asymetrical as I like. Need more plays. Luck (draw + discard) is a bit high, as it can lead to some boring moments.

Convoy is an asymmetric game in which player engage in a series of battles at various locations.  As each location is completed, cards are generally left at that location, and the battle begins anew at the next location down the line.  The Moloch player wins by getting to and winning in New York--winning in prior battles just helps him move faster.  The Moloch player plays both first, with his regular cards, and last, with his modules, but lacks the variety of movement cards the Outpost player has.  The Outpost player, on the other hand, is trying to stop the Moloch player by slowing him down and depleting his deck (which cannot be reshuffled).  The game is supposed to be Trzewiczek's improvement on an earlier game named Revolver.  However, while I have only played Revolver 2, I didn't think that Convoy was better--this one seemed to have less depth and interesting gameplay.

The game is swingy, in that your victories and defeats seem mostly dictated by the sequence that you draw your cards, and which cards get burned.  You don't feel like you have much control (when you really want to win a battle), nor do you feel like you could have done anything if your opponent counters your play.

Despite the incredibly off-putting America-centric patriarchal theme, this was surprisingly a cute little 2-player strategic card game. The asymmetrical element makes it feel like two different games as you employ different strategies depending on if you are the outpost soldiers or moloch robots. I do have to say the rule book was unnecessarily confusing for a game that was not too complicated in the end - but I think it may have been translated from another language? Thank goodness for the card index in the back - we used it almost every time when we first played the game and were getting used to the cards. And the game gets a bonus for packing up in a little box that you can take with you on the go. 

All in all, a pretty good game that I would recommend for 2-players if you can stomach the aggressive "soldiers versus robots to conquer America" theme.

RATING: 6
Typical game of 'Ignacy Trzewiczek': TONS of icons, with lots of single shots, which makes that you'll have to look up a lot what every card does and creates lots of downtime. For that reason I decreased my rating by 1. For the rest it's like Revolver, set in the world of Neuroshima Hex.

I'm sure if we played another game as the other role, future games would be richer, but frankly it isn't quite intuitive, and so even if the game is balanced, it doesn't exactly FEEL balanced, and that is nearly an equivocal problem.

RATING: 6
There are some great combos in this game. These combos make the player feel quite smart as they chain these together to do some real unexpected damage. The game has some cool decisions to make, but the problem is this game is to long for what it is. The game is teetering on 45-50 minutes at this point. With several more plays I could probably get closer to 30 minutes, but that is almost to long for what this game has to offer as well. The game is just a hair to long for what it is, and the replayability seems limited as well. Overall, a decent game, but if I had the choice between this one and several of my other 30 minute games, I would usually go with them. *** Wife:5

Tense gameplay, a unique twist of the Battle Line mechanic, fantastic art, asymmetrical yet balanced sides. Moloch is like a steamroller going from city to city, laying waste on its path, while Outpost are the mobile snipers, trying to sneak around in the ruins while picking off and weakening the Moloch convoy as it approaches the final battleground in New York. As a bonus, fans of "Neuroshima Hex" will also feel right at home with the setting. Definitely a keeper. The only downside - only for two players.

RATING: 7
An interesting retheme of Revolver. Not technically a retheme, but a very similar game.

The game is fun and delivers on what it is trying to do: a quick-playing asymmetric two-player game. The asymmetry is nice, the cards are unique and it always seems like there are plenty of decisions about how to handle any situation. The play time will probably always be 30 minutes or less.

One big issue:
The rulebook. If you're familiar with Portal Games, then you know that they always have terrible rulebooks. This game is no exception. Things are not where you would think they should be, and some things aren't explained very well. After a game or two, and possibly reading some threads on BGG, the rules mostly make sense though.

Another, smaller, issue is that playing as the Moloch faction can be not very fun. Their whole winning condition is based on simply surviving. So you often feel helpless as you lose battle after battle while the Outpost player does a lot of cool combos.

Seems like a great little package after a couple of plays, will adjust rating after more plays.

[thing=120605][/thing] is a game from Ignacy Trzewiczek, of Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on the Cursed Island fame. [thing=120605][/thing] happens in the same universe as the one in Neuroshima Hex!. In it, there are two forces in battle: the human soldiers and the Moloch, which are sentient robots that, of course, want to get rid of the human race.

Both sides have unique decks (both with 35 cards), and with three types of cards in each: units, buildings and actions - for the humans; units, modules and actions - for the Molochs. The purpose of the player of the human soldiers is to make the Moloch player to spend all the cards in his deck, while also having no units assaulting NY. So, the goal of the Moloch player is to reach NY and put units there, before the deck runs out.

The fight occurs in five differente places: Ziggy One, Iron Gate, Cleveland Harbour, Jersey Crust and New York. In each of them there are from 2 to 4 battles, and in each there are more informations:
- the limit of units that each side can put in the battles there (usually the human soldiers can put 1 more unit than the Molochs);
- the special action that the player of the humans can make by discarding cards from his hand (normally to make the Moloch player discard cards from his deck);
- the effect that each side can make when a battle is won (for the Moloch is usually to destroy a place where another battle would occur, thus making the arrival in NY faster);
- the effect of the battle, which can be one of 4 different effects: destroy a unit in the opposite side, both sides lose one unit, the winning side advances one unit to the next battles site, or the winning side takes a card from his deck.

The game order is as follows:
- the Molchs begin by chosing a battle and adding as many units as the player wants in one or more of the 5 places of battles (but only the active location will have its battle resolved);
- then the human soldiers add units and/or buildings (they can also put as many units the the player wants and in any of the five places);
- actions cards must be played in the same turn as the player is adding his units;
- after the humans are done adding units, the Moloch player can add modules to his units;
- at last, both sides compare the strenght of his units and the winning side applies the effects of winning.

Then, the Molch player chooses a new battle to happen (in the same location, but, if there aren't any more battles to happen in the active location, this one is flipped, the Moloch moves one unit from this location to the next, and then the Moloch player chooses a battle in the new active location), following the same steps of adding units, modules and comparing strenght.

[thing=120605][/thing] comes with a multitude of different units - when you see "only" 35 cards for each side you could think this wouldn't be the case, be very few units repeat themselves in the deck, so there are several unique units - and, with this, many unique effects (since most units have an ability). Therefore, a player aid is truly a necessity in this game - at all times we were playing and consulting the manual to understand the icons and the effect of the abilities - and this went all the way until the game end, since every round the players take two cards from their decks, and basically everytime came a unit/building/action/module that need some clarification. This made the game last way more than the prediction of 30 to 40 minutes that comes in the box.

Due to the many effects and symbols, the game, at first, seemed more complicated than it really is. And after some battles, the dynamics of the gameplay was fine settled, and we only struggled with the execution of some units abilities and card actions - something that, I think, will be lessened to almost nothing with more plays (but, considering how hard is to put the same game in our tables with any constancy, who knows when I will play this again?).

The downtime isn't as little as I expect for two players game, since the phase of adding units doesn't happen in the "I put one, you put one", no, it is more like: "I add four units... one here, another there and two over there, then I use this action card, move this unit, that activate it, and then it activates another, so I discard... hum... this card, to do this. And... yes, now it is you". So, some turns, can last several thinking minutes, but most won't take this long: more than once I (with the Molochs) just passed my adding units phase, and, this happened with the other side also, since you only by two cards every round, and even with some effects that allows the taking of more cards, it won't be usual to use three, fours cards every round.

Overall, [thing=120605][/thing] seemed to me as a neatly tied game, with some beautiful and thematic art. It is also portable (there are, in the game, 70 cards, the 5 city boards (made in slim cardboard) and some tokens, so the box is in basically the same size as the in [thing=71721][/thing]). And there is no doubt that a game can last the predicted time of 30 to 40 minutes.

So, for those that like games filled with cards with different effects, unique units and abilities, a high level of confrontation between two players, [thing=120605][/thing] can be a great match.

This game seems ok in terms of mechanics, but there's something in it that makes me not wanna go back to it. It might be the fact that it's very hard to plan anything, situation changes very fast and it makes the game seem very chaotic. I will play this when asked and might take it on a trip because the box is small, but in the end it's just medicore.

Horrible artwork (in my opinion), cards with lots of icons and no explanation of the icons - instead, each card is descriped in detail in the rules booklet. Rule include lots of special cases and exceptions. Would have been much better to write onto the cards what they do. I think it's playable with two people who invest lots of time in the rules, and at some point know the cards inside out. But for casual play in a gaming club, usually including new players, it's the horror. Desire to play: very low.

Gyors kártyajáték, melyben vagy az emberekkel, vagy a világuralomra törő moloch sereggel indulhatunk harcba egymás ellen.

[Comment about first version] An excellent game for two with a captivating theme, but the icons on the cards could be much clearer and the game bogs down when I have to check the rules so often. I understand that this is a better design than Revolver, but I can play Revolver more often, so I kept it and this one went.

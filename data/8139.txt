As far as miniature games go this is a very easy to learn and play one.No need for paper and pencils,no need for the latest codex,rules edition book that costs an arm and a leg,or w/e expensive paper thingy it is you need to play,not need for a lot of investment in it either.As a Collectible Miniatures Game this is Suburb! Highly detailed and/or painted minis for such an old CMG, excellent game play and rules(not the original ones.They had a lot of loopholes.Go to SnaggleToothGames.com and find their download page and get the up-to-date rules.So much better),and everything is printed on the base (but your stats don't change as much when you take damage and such).As a LotR TMG player this is one of my favorite games to play and I really recommend it to any aspiring LotR miniatures game player (I prefer this over Game Workshop's SBG by far even though because of that game I learned of this one,kinda ironic,lol).--Nate--

Nicely made minatures and OK skirmish rules make for a decent enough game of its type, with a light coating of LOTR flavour an added attraction for me  (I do like the 'Frodo wearing The Ring' miniature).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is actually a pretty nice game. Many of the sculpts are from Games Workshop's Lord of the Rings line, which means most are very nice. I like the larger minis (as compared to the Clix products), and this is much more of a real, interesting tactical game, again compared to the Clix games which seemed to me to be more about managing special powers and their interactions. There are enough subtleties to the game to make it quite interesting as these things go.

The Middle-Earth flavor is not top-tier, but it's rather good on the scale of collectible games, with one concession to practical realities (the ability to field strangely mixed forces) being unfortunate, but you can see why they did it.

If I had someone else to play this with semi-regularly, I think this is a game I'd get a kick out of at a monthly club meeting or something. But the problem is, the figures are a bit expensive given the gaming value, and it just hasn't caught on around here. The other problem is that as a wargamer, and as a player of GW's Lord of the Rings game, it just doesn't give me enough that I'm not already getting from other games.

Given infinite (or at least very large) quantities of time and money, I'd enjoy this game. But given the lack of both, I had to pass by on my way to other things, with some regret.

This was a great way to play a Lord of the Rings movie themed battlegame, if, like me, you had no access to GW's superior version. The starter set was great, so were the game's larger figure packs (I still have that cave troll), but the booster packs were the game's major drawback. Like other collectable games, if you didn't know someone else collecting, your armies would be limited to what you randomly pulled out of your booster packs. Still, this game had it's moments, and, as a LotR fan, I recommend picking the starter up, if you can still find it.

RATING: 7
Works pretty well, although the "lose when 50% of force is killed" results in strange tactical victories where one side can lose even when still owning the most powerful minis. Also Frodo can simply walk through the battlefield most of the time - as long as he moves last he doesn't have a bad chance (and his initiative roll is +1) - another strange victory. But there seems to be some potential here, the combat works pretty well and plays quickly. Bummer that it is collectable, though!

A great mini's game!  Use of maps eliminates measuring and speeds play.  Lots of flavor for the subject.  You don't need to break your wallet to get a couple decent armies.

It's also easy to teach to new players, but make sure they know what their figures special abilites are!

[Initial Impression: 3]
This was clearly designed to be primarily a collector's item.  Players place their minature plastic figures on a paper map, then move those figures into fighting positions and roll dice to determine the outcome.  Most figures have special powers that can modify the rolls or change the movement rules.  In poor keeping with theme, each figure has a 50% chance to-hit on each attack, but figures can vary in their number of attacks or in their resistance to accruing damage from an attack. The game ends when an army is 50% killed or when Frodo is dead or leaves the map. The first means that games without Frodo will seem to end prematurely, and games with the ring-bearer completely revolve around that one figure. Although the sliders and organization of information on the figures' bases exhibits some thoughtful design and I liked the individuality of the characters (which could become cumbersome in large battles), the figures themselves seem largely irrelevant to the game.  That is, you could play the same game with a bunch of dice and a pad of paper and probably get more enjoyment per unit cost.  I can see how this might appeal to small children or collectors who are willing to invest large amounts of money and time into crafting their own variants and scenarios, but I think even die-hard LotR fans will be disappointed by the poor quality of some of the figures and the poor evocation of battle. There are too many other and better LotR games out there to waste time on what is essentially an expensive dice game.

I almost passed on this game because of its collectible nature, but I'm sure glad that I didn't. This is one solid game. Nicely done minatures, tight and well written rules and loads of fun. Yes the basic mechanics are simple, but I feel this is one of the game's strengths as the flow of the game is fast paced and exciting. I am impressed with the Sabertooth website, which offers great support to its players, and also offers different scenarios and optional rules which give the game more depth. As far as the collectable aspect of the game you can buy cheap singles on the internet sites or ebay.

Surprisingly good skirmish game, fairly close to the license.  The battle resolution mechanism where hits can be distributed anywhere in a group of touching miniatures is interesting, as it reflects the somewhat fluid situation you would have in a skirmish compared to a line battle.

Collation was however quite horrible, especially for ultra-rares.

RATING: 7
Nice skirmish game that satisfies part of my wargame itch.  This is mostly a head-to-head combat game (no/few scenarios), which I find quite satisfying as such (it makes the Wings of War feel dull and uneventful).

It gives me a feeling reminiscent of playing a wargame: troops that move across a varying terrain; figures that are in a small army (unlike other miniature games like Heroscape, Space Hulk, or Claustrophobia; more like Conflict of Heroes, or even Commands and Colors); figures that only die, with no reinforcements (unlike Summoner Wars); a situation that evolves progressively, like a movie (troops being wounded).  A good points it that it's a wargame with almost no exceptions in the rules (and the few special cases found in the rules make a lot of thematic sense, like LOS being blocked by two dotted lines, etc.).

Short, with relatively simple rules: that's sweet!  On the other hand, LotR: TMG feels both "richer" and simpler than C&C:A in terms of special powers: many figures have special powers; these special powers are quite easily remembered, as they make sense, thematically; each of them is quite simple, is represented on the base (no table to look up), and they are combined in a variety of ways.  This is much more convenient and flavorful than C&C:A's relatively similar units, that require constant checks in the reference sheet.

The army building and the army positioning give me a satisfaction similar to that of deck building in Magic or the troops set-up in CoH:AtB.  You have to build a strategy, when you choose your troops; their positioning on the map is a way of making this strategy work, while at the same time anticipating how your opponent can try to prevent you from making it work.  This is enjoyable, compared to games with no set-up (Hellas, Agricola), or games with a fixed set-up (C&C:A).  HOWEVER: it is possible to lose mostly because the army was not correctly chosen: in this case, it is no fun to realize very early that the game will be hard to win; the few minutes spent setting up the army end up somewhat wasting the hour that follows.  This is a real problem; it may be solve by allowing defeats to be conceded (in this case, the armies can be chosen again).

Reportedly better than Heroclix (which is more about managing special powers, apparently).

Pre-painted figures: they look good enough (though it is hard to find Arwen as beautiful as in the movie), and are nice to play with.  They are more refined than those of Rise of the Valkyries.

Part of the lower rating comes from people who found the game too expensive (boosters, collectible minis).  This is not true anymore: one can build two 2000+ points armies (more than the 1000 or 1500 points of a "normal" army of 8-12 figures), get 4 additional boards/maps for about 35 € (shipping included), at least in Europe (about 1 €/figure).  Maybe add 10 € for 25 dice (that can have a general use).

50 %-50 % of Archer-Melee soldiers seems good.  Can be 40 %-60 %, depending on the map/scenario.

Having the maximum allowed number of minions gives a different feel to the game: the minions start to be useful collectively.  Sure, they die fast; but they do contribute significantly to victory.  For a 1500 points army, that's about 3 heroes and 15 minions (45 points/minion, 225 points/hero, 5 command points/hero, on average over my 65 figures)–Hobbits tend to cost less, so you can usually put more than 3 in the army.

However, with lots of minions, the battle takes more time (lots of little figures), and heroes can get a very small share of action.  With lots of heroes, combats are interesting (special powers), but minions are too weak and pretty much useless.  Maybe using half the command points for the number of minions would be a good compromise, for us.

As for the size of the army, the 2.5k army on 2 maps was impressive, but did not bring much more than a 2k army too me, and was quite long (2 hours?).

The next, less important complaint about the game being about 1 big battle without much room for maneuvering; this is not my experience, both with the Starter Set (400 points, 4 figures each) and with a 2500 point army on 2 maps; scenarios might helps with that.

The game dynamics and tempo.  The bad: it takes some time to move 25 figures, and your opponent might get a little bored (unless he checks the validity of all your moves, and gauges the situation as it is evolving).  The good:
- Phase 1: The armies start far away from each other: the strategic maneuvering is interesting (you find a good location for each segment of your army, you put your heroes in a useful location).  The decisions mostly involve movements, and maybe a few archery shots, which helps speed up each player's movement phase.
- Phase 2: The maneuvering keeps you busy until the first combats.  The combat phase is full of surprises (you never know how the dice will play), which forces you to make interesting tactical decisions (ugh, I did not expect his Warg rider to break my line of defense; why can I do, now that my opponent is dangerously close to Frodo?).
- Phase 3: The winning conditions become more and more relevant, as you must keep an eye on the number of casualties on each side, or on Frodo's location (if he escapes,…).  The casualties become greater and greater, so you have fewer and fewer figures to play with, which increases the game speed and the tension (losing becomes much more of a reality).  Heroes might also become quite important at this phase (or maybe in Phase 2), which brings yet another layer of dynamics, as they are much more powerful than minions: they can hold positions, they can use usefully their special powers (healing,…).
- All in all, these different games keep the game interesting, by constantly shifting the objectives and the methods you use for achieving them.

Open questions: how does it compare to Heroscape? (No terrain building)

For faster game play: remove 1 life to all figures.

More interesting game play: play/invent scenarios (otherwise, big battle between 2 groups).  However, the battles in themselves have some nice strategic and tactical elements that makes them interesting: it is usually possible to point out errors made, and to learn from them, and feel satisfied.

This is my first entry into the TMG sector.  Only got it 'cos I found a cheap starter pack on e-bay, but I'm impressed with the combat system.  

It's quick, tactical and great fun - the special abilities, action points and critical hit system all work really well imho.

Now that knock down price boosters are appearing on the UK market I'm amassing a sizeable pair of forces making for some interesting pitched battles.

Add the fact that it works great with Heroscape terrain and you have a winning combination.

The figures are cool, I'll admit that, but the game mechanics are weak.  Maybe my bad impression is because I only have a starter, and can't sport a whole army.  This in itself is pretty lame...with one starter you can't play a complete game?  The crazy rarity scheme (all the heroes are rare or ultra rares??) means you'll have to shell out some serious dough to get a decent collection/playable army...and the game's not fun enough to justify such an expense.

Smooth play, figure balance is good.  Playing multiples of same character specifically banned by the rules (No 3 Spiderman's on one team like Heroclix.)  Basically it is miniatures light, but many of the missing complications make room for quick play and more enjoyment.  The only major down point is the "Collectible" aspect.

RATING: 9
Great figures, already painted is a must for someone who doesn't have time to paint, and a great but simple to learn game system. For me I would like to add some strategic element to give it more depth now. I am working on it!

I have given it a 9 because I love the figures and the simple system of stats.

This just didn't take off for us (my young son and I). I will try it again at some point, just in case there's some fun hiding here, but for now we have better options in other games, such as HeroScape. The Lord of the Rings theme makes me want to find something good in it.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, my son and I have been giving it an absolute flogging. The rules only take about 5 mins to read, and within 10 mins you should be well and truely in the thick of battle. We dont play the Battle Chain rules, and sugest that you get a copy of the Tournament Rules for rule clarification. My only grippe is buying booster and not knowing what you are buying, I think ebay might be the go. Can't wait for the new maps and the Cave Troll. It looks like they are working on a Two Towers expansion.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game, and still hope some rule tweaks can save it.
The minis are good value. They are Lord of the Rings and they look better than Mage Knights.
Where the game collapses badly is in the play. Without scenarios or real objectives, all the great figures merely converge in one or two gigantic melee-dice fests. The LOTR battle game from GamesWorkshop offers much more variety and tactical thinking with 25mm figures than this game offers with 40mms.
Too bad. I hope they fix it so I can use my small collection

Based on reading of rules..it's...alright.  The theme would have to be what makes the game, though, I'm not sure anyone would have any interest in playing it without that.  There just isn't enough real 'depth' to the game to justify a significant time or emotional investment in.  Maybe as a filler between other games?  Say, for gamers to play when they drop out of an 'elimination' game being played at game night?  The play time of '60 minutes' seems high, unless you've built up pretty large armies.

[b]EXCITING MINIATURE SKIRMISH GAME.[/b]

If you're a huge LoTR fan like me, then you might just be interested a teeny bit in any game that attempts to recreate scenes/battles from Tolkien's masterwork. This is one such effort.

Played on nicely done hex mats, this skirmish game uses a superior, on-the-base system than Heroclix to eliminate game upkeep and bookkeeping. Aragorn suffer a wound? No problem; move the little lever one notch down. Job done. The nuts and bolts of the game are actually pretty similar to GW's LoTR Strategy Battle Game, except with the chart checking and measuring sticks removed.

So, it's official. I'm mesmerised by the potential of these plastic models. Sure, I enjoy painting lead miniatures as much as the next hobbyist, and the paintwork here is functional to good, but this game's pulling power is in the lack of game-maintenance, plus I don't have to paint and detail an army of Moria goblins. I can just focus on making the battlefields.

I certainly wouldn't attempt to recreate the entire battle for Helm's Deep, or Heaven forbid the battle on the Pelennor Fields using this game. That would require way too much lifting of miniatures and altering base stats. However, if you want to set up the battle for the Hornberg, the fight at Weathertop, the scenes in Moria, or the melee at Amon Hen, then this puppy might be worth a look. I especially fancy doing Balin's Tomb and Amon Hen myself.

And what's great about any miniature game, usually, is that you can alter the situations to the desires of your own warped imagination. Fancy popping a couple of Ringwraiths into Amon Hen against the full Fellowship? You do? Goodo, so do I! This game allows you to drop in forces of each player's choosing with no fuss; just a simple points-based match-up, all inscribed on the hexagonal base pedestals. So very Warhammer (the points thing).

[b]HOBBITON:[/b]

1. LoTR theme.
2. All major characters represented - including most of the movie inventions.
3. Great stat-on-the-base system.
4. Nicely pre-painted figures.
5. Interesting damage chain rules - a break from the model-to-model norm. These rules are surprising, coming from a CMG, and quite innovative. The simple explanation is that you total all the attacks for all the models adjacent to each other, and then allocate any damage inflicted as you wish, up or down the "chain" of enemy models. So, this means that the Fellowship can actually work as a team to bring down a Cave Troll, or any large/tough foe, for instance. Likewise, the forces of Sauron can do the same right back at you. Ouch! That's Boromir dead again, in the Chamber of Records.
6. Cool action-point mechanism.
7. Great dice.
8. Simple rules.
9. Nice blocking rules about combat-engaged fighters.
10. Fairly well balanced points system.
11. Most of the main characters have different poses and stats - which is useful for scenario balance, but makes collecting a nightmare. For instance, Gandalf the Grey's standard figure is pretty powerful against most foes, but his 1500-point version is all-conquering; which is lucky considering he has to confront the ferocious Balrog - the Flame of Udun, or Durin's Bane - in the Second Hall. And, I've got 5 different Aragorns already, and I'm not collecting!
12. Fairly cool hero powers - for Good and Evil! Making a fight against the hordes of Moria, etc, more interesting, when the occasional goblin archer is an evil hero with nefarious, Fellowship hurting powers; like archery Shot Caller, which gifts all goblin minion archers with additional attack dice against a specific target. "Kill the bearded stunty!" screeched Mobzag, pointing his gauntlet at Gimli, Son of Gloin. "Pepper him with arrows!"
13. Two-tier warrior system: ALL combatants are either a hero or a minion. Guess which slot Strider falls into... I think you've got the idea!
14. Tactical dice-changing rules. While you do only hit and wound enemies depending on the outcome of dice rolls, this game, interestingly allows you to pay (in action points) to change the outcome of your lowest rolls. That's a great idea.

[b]BARAD-DUR:[/b]

1. Sucky collectability.
2. OOP - all the figures are rarish now, I suppose.
3. Expensive. Or can be if you want a Balrog or Cave Troll!
4. Large scale. 40mm, I think.
5. No Shelob! The range was cancelled before [i]all[/i] the LoTR universe could be reforged into plastic.
6. The Cave Troll should have a chain, ranged attack. This is the movie skirmish game, after all. So a house rule is in order: Chain 3/3.
7. Skillet-o-dice game.
8. Two roll hit system.

GAME-SPEED TIP:
Try dropping the wound level of every figure at the start of the game by 1 wound. This speeds up the battle enormously, making your bog standard orc minion drop at the first swordblow or arrowshot; as it should be!

Also, I believe that engaged models shouldn't be able to shoot arrows at point blank range. Can't find anything in the rules to contradict this, but it just doesn't feel right. Elvish archers, you'll just have to draw your daggers.
UPDATE: This has been clarified my way in the official Rules v1.2.

[b]OPTIONAL HOUSE RULE:[/b] In the strategy phase, if the dice rolls are tied, priority auto changes from one side to the other - so the side that was the attacker in the previous turn will always lose it on a tie.

[b]GAME-PIMPING PROJECT:[/b]
I admit it. I do. I'm obsessed with LoTR and Middle-Earth. Have been since recieving my Dad's copy of The Hobbit in 1982 (cover art was a sketch of Smaug's attack on Laketown, drawn by Tolkien himself). I also love Peter Jackson's movie versions of the trilogy. So, after saying all that, you can understand - maybe just a little bit - why I'd want to recreate some of the battles from the books, magnificently realised by Jackson and Weta.
I'm partway through building a Combat Hex game environment, roughly 3' by 3' of the Chamber of Mazarbul - otherwise known as Balin's Tomb, with a hex-styled flagstone floor.

WEST-GATE AND WATCHER IN THE WATER COMPLETED: 12/7/11

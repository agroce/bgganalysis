Can be fun on occasion even if you don't know everything. Death of the dinosaurs goes on the far left, and the invention of spray paint somewhere in the middle. Someone is going to have to guess at some point, unless you play it so often you can remember where things fell the last time. Seems almost like an educational game in disguise...

RATING: 7
The idea for the game is simple yet very clever. The cards are nice-looking (I like that they are small, as timelines can get pretty large when players suck) and the subject is right up my alley. However, I found many cards in this set to be questionable (the "Invention of the Helicopter" or "Chess", for example), and these can make the game frustrating. Maybe other sets in this game family, with clearer questions, will be more satisfying.

RATING: N/A
A good, fun, filler trivia game. Hurdles effortlessly over most of the usual problems with trivia games by not asking you to name specific years from memory, but rather intuit which of an increasingly-narrowing set of date ranges particular events fall into.

Fails miserably at useful-packaging-design, however, with a tin which is not only far too large for the contents but also has an embossed lid and therefore cannot be easily stacked!

Perfect game when waiting for another player. Takes seconds to explain the rules and length can be adapted as wished.
We sometimes continue placing cards even after ending the game, because it's interesting to see all those dates and to compare events with eachother.

Replayability is not so good if you play with people who remember all the dates from previous games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really fun little filler that I would rate higher if the very nature of the game didn't mean that you can only play it so often before memory sort of ruins it. But by memorising all those dates you've actually learned something by playing a game, and that's pretty neat! Good to bust out once in a while. Maybe I should add some more sets...

Timeline - even «Diversity’s» hotchpotch of random and mostly forgettable events - is a fast and moderately fun way to show your friends your ignorance on several subjects: I’m unsure whether it still can be considered a game or an idle pastime, anyhow it’s fun to see your friends struggle with even the most basic historical events or dates and miserably fail.

That is one of the rare moments in today’s barbaric age when you can openly take pride in your (usually scorned) humanistic background and crush your opponents, see them driven before you and hear their womanly lamentations.

1 play:

Not much of a game, really, but a decent piece of edutainment. Playing this was very effective in getting my daughters talking about history and thinking about where technological developments fit in it. I don't think I'll get them to play very many times, however.

A few complaints:

There are some cards which refer to events that happen in fiction, such as the Trojan Horse. This seems confusing to me -- do they refer to when the story was created, when it was written down, or when it happened in its own fictional world?

The cards look very similar on both sides, which makes it a very slow process to sort the cards correctly if they get mixed up. This seems completely unnecessary.

Finally, the cards are ridiculously small. Since there is tons of unused space in the box, it's pretty ridiculous that they couldn't be made just a little bit bigger. As it is, there pretty much impossible for a child to shuffle, and plenty annoying for an adult to shuffle.

Covers -100,000,000 to 1985.  Deck midpoint is 1820.  30% of deck is prehistoric and ancient, and very few cards lie between 70BC and 1500AD.

I don't like that the diversity pack shares cards with the other Timeline sets. When I mix this with my Historical Events deck, there is a significant number of duplicate events.

To me, Timeline is quite a cool trivia game. I don’t love it (as my rating reflects), but with the right crowd (often non-gamers), this is an excellent game. It’s easy to teach and play and is educational; I love the moments when you go “what?! Did this thing exist 2000 BC?! I thought it was made in 400 AD” or something like that. 
Diversity is definitely one of the better games in the Timeline series along with Inventions. It has a ton of different themed cards; discoveries and inventions and books/stories and much more. Compared to “Timeline: Music & Cinema”, I vastly prefer this edition!

It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

And since you can mix up all the different sets, replay value is still there. Or can you remember over 500 dates? :D

Timeline is a fun filler game that surprises most people. Many people think that they will be bored because it almost seems like learning, but once they get into it, people yell, goof of and generally have a good time. It is a bit on the expensive side when you purchase the cards, and is probably replaced by its own iOS app in my opinion.  But I still love to have it around on game night for an easy to teach filler that most everyone will enjoy.

Good game to play sporadically with my non-gaming family members and friends.  Proved to be a hit for Christmas 2015 and 2016.  

We play with 6 sets mixed in together (Discoveries, Diversity/General Interest, Historical Events, Inventions, Music & Cinema and British History) and even then you start getting the same cards again fairly quickly.  However, none of us have particularly good memories so it doesn't matter too much!  If you're playing with people who have good memories then I'd recommend mixing at least 2-3 sets together.

Players take turns to add one of their invention cards to the timeline - a row of inventions, along with their associated date, in the centre of the board. The played card is then flipped to reveal its date, and if correct its added to the timeline.  If incorrect, it's discarded from the game and replaced with another card from the deck. Object is the first to play all their cards correctly into the timeline.  Brilliantly executed, yet very simple game. Quite subtle too, as you try to get the coarse guesses out there early, while the timeline is more forgiving.  This set is the fourth I've seen and the first one that made me think the series is running out of steam.  Some of the cards here are very vague, and quite tough to peg.  The art is very sloppy too.

Nice production, and I like the set of events in this version of timeline.

Some of the events are contentious to a greater or lesser degree: "The introduction of the clementine" - to where?  "The discovery of Machu Picchu" - which discovery?  Arguably, this is part of the appeal of the game, that it might stimulate conversation around those issues.  I would love a bit of extra flavour text or trivial about the event on the side with the date.  Or a qrcode, to a reference page.

I play with different groups of people, so I don't have to worry about whether there are replayability issues with this game.  If the players eventually memorise the majority of the 100 events that's probably worth the £12 paid, anyway.

I wish the cards weren't so small, older players will definitely need to go fetch their reading glasses to have a clue what's going on.  

A game to be played with Alexa / Google Home within hearing range...

I like this game and the idea of this game very much, but it gets a 6 from me because I like it when in trivia games they give little extra information on the back about the event, invention, ect. - even if it is just a short sentence (Wits and Wagers does this pretty well)  It would be especially fitting in this one because the backside is basically empty.  This would aid me in learning (the fun part of trivia games) more so than it does in its current form.  Nonetheless, I still like it a lot as a filler.

More cards for one of my favorite filler games. I really like it and I never say no to a game of Timeline. It is so simple and fast, everyone likes it. As I have all the Timeline sets, memory plays a very inferior role. 

I wish there was an easy way to separate the cards once you have combined all the sets, also, at the end of the game it is a chore to count the 400+ cards of all the sets when they are mixed :S. I always count all the game components before putting it away.

I continue to love all the Timeline series of games. I’m expecting the new one (Music and Cinema) to arrive at my home right now. However, I’m doing an effort to keep my game ratings in accord to the BGG recommended rating system, so I have to downgrade Timeline: Diversity rating. Still a very good game.

It took a couple of years, but I’m finally tired of playing Timeline. Nowadays, I almost never want to do this and I usually resist it. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating, however I think I will keep them in my game collection, at least until I try Timeline Challenge. I would still play it from time to time.

Timeline: Diversity is no longer among my favorite games of 2012.

RATING: 8.5
Put the cards depicting the widest range of items you have into the right spots on the developing time line based on their creation: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but you will be getting taught by the game as to a bunch of dates you did not know. It's fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The only downside is that you'll eventually know the cards and have to mix in other sets.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with strong involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards

Simple but enjoyable filler of a game. We play it in the local coffee shop as the tin fits nicely inside a pocket. Has one big downside which that you start to remember the cards. Mixing sets and leaving the current set alone and playing a different one seems a sensible plan to avoid getting to know any one set too well.

Got this as my first set as it is a variety of categories, but found the content leaning more towards world history than my liking. I later bought Movies & Cinema and thoroughly enjoyed that more. As a variety pack I found Americana a great mix between American History and Pop Culture...and more of what I thought the mix would be with Diversity.

Timeline: Diversity is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.

RATING: 5.9
Timeline is a tricky game.  It can be lots of fun -- the central premise is great, and the mechanic is pretty simple for what is essentially a trivia contest.  The problem is that its replay value is very low; once you know the answers, you can't really play a card anymore, so it depends on the existence of tons of booster packs.  And since there's only a limited number of those, you can't really play it very often.

That said, it's still fun.  The new version seems more directed at school-age students, but the art is lively and fine, and the packaging is nice.  There's around eight booster packs, still not enough but sufficient to get you going.

This is best played with a larger group (4 or more) so that the timeline really builds up.  Surprisingly tricky to squeeze in some of the events when the timeline begins to pinch the dates.  A great quick filler game.

This is a fun game for me because I win constantly.  I don't know why my friends are always so excited to play this.  I don't think they've yet realized that I win every goddam time, which is a testament to how fun it is, I guess?

Un gran juego en el que todos a los que se lo hemos enseñado se interesan de inmediato. Me gusta que tengan tantas cosas dentro del juego, pues así aseguras que no ganará el clásico sabelotodo. Algo que no me gusta es que las cartas sean pequeñas, pues dificulta el barajeo, pero entiendo que es para que la línea del tiempo tenga un tamaño manejable.

RATING: 8
This is such a simple game, I can't believe no one's thought of it yet. In fact, it's so simple, it almost borders on not being a game IMO. It's literally just a deck full of cards with the dates on one side, and you're supposed to create a "timeline" of the dates. Pretty simple. Takes about 10 (ok, maybe 20) seconds to teach. Great for literally anyone to play. The reason this doesn't get a higher rating is the fact that some of these dates are wrong. In a game that's literally a deck of cards with dates on them, getting the dates right seems to be about the only job you had in creating the game. This game gets much better the more expansions you add in too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Feels like an educational game. You take a card and try to guess where it would fit in the timeline formed by the other cards. Your goal is to get rid of all your cards. It's OK, but doesn't feel much like a game. Replayability is pretty low, since, once you've played it a few times, you'll most likely know the approximate dates. Still, I could see the Timeline games working well for History teachers in class.

Dirt simple mechanics, quick play time, and great variety if you own all the sets- this little trivia/party game fills a lot of holes, especially if you have a persnickety game group (which I do at times). A great way to pass 15 minutes, though I'll wager your players will ask for another round or two.

Brilliant little game that doesn't outstay its welcome. I think that although there are a lot of cards in the tin, it wouldn't take that long to start memorising the more memorable ones, so I'd recommend combining multiple sets. Each set is reasonably pricey for a short filler game (~£12) but there's a lot of art on the cards - I think on balance I prefer the better production values and varied art to paying a lower price.

RATING: 7
This is a very light game of trying to place key dates within the chronology of an ever growing timeline. 

It is a game but is heavily knowledge based and over-familiarity can reduce the fun to be had and competitive nature of the game.

Production wise the games in the series are just gorgeous to look at and many a collector will buy them for that reason alone. 

This is something very differnet for a person's collection and is also perfect for families and school's as an educational resource.

The series is also great for dinner parties as conversation starters.

This is a test your memory and knowledge of when things were invented/discovered etc.. game. You need to get rid of your cards by placing them correctly in the timeline relative to other cards. Surprisingly educational and probably a good game for kids and teenagers.

The fun of this game comes from interacting with the other players and basically realizing you don't remember anything from history class.  Don't play it with someone just out of high school, they cheat.

Basically the same as Anno Domini, and like that version they're milking the series for all they can, but only at 110 prettier cards a time. Unfortunately Timeline has only one third of the cards of a base Anno Domini set and once you've added a few sets together you're starting to get a ridiculously expensive game. To make a game you can pull out more than a few times you need to mix the other topics of Timeline into the one game - which makes it a pricey game - so I'd suggest buying the 220 card mixed version and just leave it at that.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Certainly the small deck drags the rating down on this one.

This particular variant of Timeline has a lot of different things in it, so like the name says it celebrates diversity. If you've played one variant of Timeline you'll easily be able to pick up any other variant since they all use the same rules; only the cards are different. You can also mix and match, but we've never done that yet.

I really like how simple this game is to pull out, how portable it is, and how accommodating of a wide range of players it is. It's easy to teach and easy to pick up.

Első Timeline játékom. A játékosok négy találmányt, érdekességet kapnak, amit be kell helyezni időrendbe az eddig letett kártyákhoz, ha nem sikerül jól belőni a keletkezését, akkor kapunk helyette egy újabb kártyát, ha sikerült fogynak a kártyáink. Cél minél hamarabb mindet betenni a sorba. Ennyi a szabály, gyors, egyszerű, de szerintem több játék után simán megjegyezhető a körülbelüli évszám, így az újrajátszhatósága kicsit kérdéses.

Same great game as original Timeline, but this one has good range of stuff to guess without doubtful stuff.
The problem remains that you go through half the card in a 4 players game meaning replay value is low.

All of the Timeline series have the same premise:
Play the cards to the table so that the card you're playing fits in chronological order. If you can do that then the card remains in play. If not then it's discarded and you draw a new card.
The game makes an excellent learning tool for children.

More of the same and it remains as good.

I'm not entirely sure why the introduction of bees is one of the cards though... :)

No está mal, para echar una partida rápida. Las ilustraciones de las cartas son bonitas y la lata le da un toque de elegancia. Lo cambié porque casi no lo sacaba a mesa y una vez que lo has jugado unas cuantas veces se torna repetitivo. Es un juego que supongo que gana más con las expansiones, pero nunca le llegué a pillar el gusto.

Another good entry in the Timeline series. The title "Diversity" is a little misleading because it seems like this set is mainly about inventions, but there are a few other things mixed in.

This game is quite good to play with non-gamers and people who would be thrown by different themes. Would like to get the music/cinema/pop culture expansion as I think that would be more recognizable things.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: Timeline is awesome, regardless of the topical focus of a given set. It encourages historical trivia without directly punishing you for a less-than-eidetic memory. Players have a hand of cards listing a significant event. They cannot see the date of that event, which is printed on the reverse. A timeline forms on the table, in which players must insert a card from their hand into the appropriate place on the timeline. It begins very easy, but the guesswork becomes more and more difficult as the dates fill in and players have smaller windows to target. It is a lot of fun. It does, however, play a bit unfairly between people with extensive historical trivia and those who do not, particularly in the later game (knowing the exact year of an event means you should hold those cards for when precision becomes necessary). In the end, we really enjoy it, but rarely find a place for it in our rotation, so we decided to find it a better home.

I really enjoy the timeline series but admit part of that infatuation is my curiosity and desire to better cement my understanding of relative history.

As a game itself it couldn't be quicker to teach, setup, or tear down, and you can tweak the initial number of cards to add or reduce length from its super manageable ~15 minute playtime.

This adds more of the same stuff to what we saw in Inventions, Discoveries, and Historical Events, so here's a repeat of what I said with the first game in the series:

"Play one of your invention cards into what you think is its proper place in a growing timeline and then flip it over to see if you were right.  Were you?  Then leave it there.  If you weren't, you discard it and draw another card.  Play until at least one player runs out of cards.  It doesn't sound like much, and folks with a good history background have an advantage, while its replayability will be affected by how good your memory is over time, but it's actually a neat little game with a nice narrative and some tactics to use over the course of the game.  You might even learn something as you play!  I do recommend drawing off of the bottom of the stack, though, so you don't get to see what your next card is going to be."

I'm not too in love with this expansion...the phrasing could have been better on a few of the cards (First appearance of Yeti? of flying saucers?) and there were a few that seemed to contradict other cards or be ambiguous as to what they were asking (we had invention of the camera - 1888 show up in [i]Diversity[/i] and first photo in a newspaper - 1880 show up in [i]Historical Events[/i]).

A q & a type game which requires general knowledge but you do not need to have a head of trivia to play and enjoy. The artwork and the tin gives it at least a point! Played as individuals only, next time as teams. As a party game and filler it is great and I have rated as such.

Great for people like me who don't actually know much history. You just have to guess the correct range for an event not the actual date. 

Can be a bit stressful depending on the group, but the families and new gamers seem to eat this one up.

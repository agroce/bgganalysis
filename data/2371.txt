nice solitaire dice game. play online @ http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~carador/choice/
high score: 1080, using 2 out of 3 jokers, with one "free ride"
dunno if the joker's are sackson's, but they're good design: a limited resource that adds another layer of decision-making on top of the mindless math.
would be a 7 if the optimal #s weren't known

RATING: 6
Fun little dice rolling filler where players all work off the same rolls of 5 dice.  For each roll, players make 2 pairs, adding a check mark in a row that matches the sum of each pair.  The catch is that if you start a row, but don't make enough of that sum throughout the game, you lose points for that row.  However, if you make a bunch of pairs of that sum throughout the game, you'll score a bunch of points.

The catch is that you must enter the leftover die into you "extra" column.  For the entire game, you are allowed to use three numbers as extras.  So, for example, if throughout the game I've declared 2's, 5's , and 6's as extras, for each die roll I must set aside wither a 2, 5, or 6, and make two pairs out of the remaining 4 dice, sometimes forcing me to make pairs I didn't really want.

All in all, I like it as a quick dice roller!  Plus, the game box converting into a dice tower is just plain genius (even if the dice tower was made in such a way that makes the dice nearly impossible to see for all players!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It is fascinating to play this game with others. I love watching our plays diverge, even though we are all dealing with the same dice. As such, I far prefer it with others as opposed to solo.

RATING: 7
It's Solo Can't Stop! This retains some of its sibling's tension and plays in like a 1/3rd of the time, though I'm sure it's not as much fun multiplayer.

I can't see this being super replayable... it's so mathy that I'm sure there's just an optimal strategy, and from there it's just getting lucky.

My first guess is that the best thing to do in the early game is to always play it safe and start with the sums most statistically most likely to come up - getting more points for the unlikelier rolls doesn't feel like a rich enough reward (like, why would you ever start a 2 AND a 12 row?). Tactically, the main fun is in the endgame when you really have to think carefully about filling up your fifth die rows. But I can see enjoying figuring out the strategy in the meta-game for awhile.

Still, if you've got some dice and 10 minutes to kill it's a fun enough little puzzle.

I got 110!

Edit: The above is based on the "Choice" version scoring system - it looks like my main complaint was addressed in the 2011 "Extra!" reprint.

Edit: My first score with the Extra! scoresheet is -40. It still feels more satisfying. I now think this is a pretty fun randomized puzzle. Upgraded from a 6 to a 7.

Current High Score: 300

A similar style game as Qwinto, Qwixx, and Twenty One, with a slightly stronger push your luck element. Depending on the early dice rolls, players might end up with very similar numbers in their 'Extra' columns causing players to follow near identical paths when grouping the dice. Also, without the ability to re-roll any dice the game doesn't effectively capitalize on the communal dice mechanic. All in all, it leaves more to be desired.

RATING: 6
Fine filler.
Solitaire to max score, but works with others bc
the challenge is relative (not absolute) score.
Little bit of luck if you get a free roll and other player(s) do not
but generally I use the same Can't Stop prob approach.

Somewhat challenging game -- haven't scored (legally) over 500 yet. Not sure if there'll be anything after I've  solved it. Main reason to play this is a five-minute solo-play-but-not-quite-a-puzzle effect.

The rules are in the Gamut of Games book (OK, also on BGG).

RATING: 6
Luck is too dominating. I knew it would, but I expected it to be a bit less. You can be very unlucky when throwing f.i. 4x same die or a tripple plus one from your 5th die choices and the other one not, as then you don't have any coice at all in selecting your pairs. Imagine such a throw by the end of a game, being obligated to note down results you didn't choose yet and you will be scoring a couple of 200 penalty points with no more chance to recover from that. On the other hand, one can also be very lucky in having a couple of free throws (none of your three 5th die choices in your throw). All in all, it felt a bit like Yahtzee.

We play from "Gamut of Games" where it is called "Solitaire Dice". Playing with 2 or more people works; everyone uses the same dice throws and keeps their score sheets hidden.

Update: my high score is now 420, I am so pleased; however, according to Sid, you are a winner if you score over 500. Someday, for me...maybe.

Sid Sackson's other great push-your-luck dice game, after Can't Stop. Players roll five dice and divide them into two sets of two to cross out numbers on a score pad. As in Lost Cities, starting a number's row condemns the player to negative points until a certain threshold is reached. Complicating matters, players select three numbers... one of which they must set aside each turn, if possible. When one of these numbers fills its column the game ends. The game is multiplayer solitaire, for sure, but it's very playable and presages great dice games like Qwixx.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
some mildly interesting decisions to be made in this solitaire-and-compare, as with Yahtzee. Essentially a variant of Yahtzee. I wonder if it would work with multiple people, duplicate style. As it is, there's a certain level of human comfort in having someone there to complain to about bad rolls, but from a game mechanics perspective there's no great reason to play multi-player.

Played as "Solitaire Dice" from the Gamut of Games book, this is a very lively game, less polished but more demanding and not very far from "Can't Stop". Some luck is obviously involved, but after several games the player can grasp some "strategies" (in the loosest sense of the word).

I love the dice masterpiece Can't Stop, and this is its interesting solo-able predecessor. It's abstract and math-y, but the gameplay is fun, and it plays in about 10-15 minutes. I haven't played it multiplayer, although it would be interesting to try. It's not as good as Can't Stop, but it requires only a printed scoresheet and dice (rather than a board), so Solitaire Dice might be the better travel game. 

Played as a solo lunch break game.

fp10/89,

RATING: 6
A solo dice game that comes in at the right length (10 mims) and feels like a mini-Can't Stop. Each turn is a roll of 5 dice, choosing which of the 5 to reject, and how best to pair up the remaining 4 dice. Your aim is to ensure each pairing you choose comes up 5 or more times over all your rolls before any 1 of your reject number occurs 8 times. Which should give you about 20 rolls because you can only choose 3 distinct reject numbers, which you must re-use if they come up. And at least one reject number will show up in 31 out of 32 rolls, so don't expect too many pain-free rolls. Any pairing that only gets 1-4 occurences loses you 200 points, and pairings that get over 5 occurences slowly earn you positive points, their scale dependent on expected frequency. There are tricks to learn in regards to what pairings to go for given the numbers you mark as rejectables. You might not want to collect 11's and 12's if you've marked 6 as a reject for instance. But even if you feel you've got the odds down and you're playing well, it only takes 1 freaky roll to get you a forced pairing you really didn't want to start and boom, your score is down the drain. But given the game length, it's passable and a playable solitaire whilst watching tv maybe. Each roll provides a decent choice that's slightly more interesting than your standard re-roll decision which a lot of other dice solitaire games depend on.

Sid Sackson's Solitare Dice / Choice with slightly adjusted scoring system.

The online version is more fun than playing it face-to-face, which isn't a good sign.

The portable dice tower is very cool, except the design is somewhat cumbersome to use, especially for this game. The far lip of the dice tower is a bit too high, which noticeably obstructs the view of the dice. It's significant in this game since all players use the same dice rolls each turn.

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very similar to Can't Stop in mechanism but quite different in play style.  It lacks the push your luck aspect as much and feels like it kind of plays itself. It seems common for multiple players to end up doing the exact same thing for the first half 1/3 of the game, but then they start going down different paths.  It's still quite enjoyable and addictive, and a good alternative to the likes of Qwixx and Qwinto.

Update: huge hit with my friends. It is very addictive. It can feel mindless and not a lot of player choice and yet players with similar boards can slowly diverge with one doing very well and the other tanking, and their choices mattered. The -200 cost (and simultaneous play) elevates it above Can't Stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(Einstein) Fascinating, how players use the same dice throws and, depending on strategy and luck, get totally different scores at the end... A typical case of "Stupid game of pure luck, but why do I always lose?" Of all Sackson designs the game which gets played most often in my family (followed by Sleuth and Can't Stop). I like it even as a game of solitaire.

From Spirit Games

Yet another great dice from Sid Sackson. Definately a nod towards Cant Stop with this one. But this one has 5 dice and the extra one not chosen as a pair is discarded into your extra column. You can have 3 different die numbers in these columns, but when one of these reaches the bottom of the column, then it's game over.

Very difficult to get a positive score, but great fun.

Wifey approved.

Rather addictive little dice game.  The Java version of this is pretty tough to quit.  Many tough little choices.  The late game is intriguing as you are playing to bide time and to not start new rows, perhaps not scoring just to prevent the rapidly approaching end long enough to get your investments in the green.  I'd bet money that Knizia had played this before creating Lost Cities.

As cool as the Hexagames dice globe is, I just can't bring myself to buy this game when you can use any old dice.

RATING: 7
Quick dicey filler. A shared 5-dice roll, each player then splits 2+2+1, with the 1 progressing a timer track, and the other 2 pairs adding to possible scores. Committing to a sum initially yields negative scores, so you want the same sums repeatedly to earn positive scores. The sort of quick, simple game I’m always happy to play, although the need to gather pens or pencils is a slight drag.

RATING: 7
A kind of 5-dice Can't Stop variant, where your initial choices of which die to reject dictate your mandatory die rejects later, and control how many turns you get. Pencil & paper scoring is a touch fiddly. The plastic box/dice tower is a great idea, but can leave dice a little hard to see.

A light card-based wargame that I've enjoyed the few times we've played it.  Lots of different unit types, which is good, a quick combat resolution system, and an interesting method of issuing orders to your units make for a challenging field-general experience when managing a large number of units.  Plays pretty fast too, which is nice.  Movement is free-form and thus a bit fiddly, but if you're not too precise about it it goes fast.

RATING: 6.8
The game that should've had all of BattleLore's success.   More fun, far less expensive, much more robust gameplay, and a much better treatment of massed melee combat.  Although fairly simple, it can take awhile to internalize the rules;  movement can be a bit wonky as units collide and compete for space, and it's a little too easy to forget which units have which advantages and so forth.

RATING: 8
I've always wanted to try playing miniature wargames; Battleground: Fantasy warfare made this possible at a price I'm willing to pay. It is a great game, filled with a surprising amount of strategy despite dice rolling solving everything in the game. Yes, even though the dice adds randomness then it all seems to be fairly well balanced and a great plus is that a good strategy in this game really matters.

Game methodology is foggy and getting worse. Seems a Fan-boy club has taken over the game's forum and censors comments on the game's mechanics they disagree with.

Once engaged it is a fight to the breaking of morale or death (which usually happens if engaged at that point). Best advice: don't get Pinched. Numbers of units usually makes a difference. Have your Strongest units attack the opponents weakest, then proceed to Pinch your opponent.

(update 110514 The rules have changed so much (Not for the better) that I no longer play the game. I can no longer recommend the game.)
It has now been confirmed, the owner has abandoned the game to his chosen replacement. This replacement has boasted his prowess at 'knowing' the game but has instead insidiously changed the game's mechanics Substantially in  regard to the overall play.
In this regard, the "Physics" to the game keep changing.
The 'replacement' also had a significant part in the Dark Elves and Punic War debacles.

This seems like it should be an outstanding game and minatures alternative.  However, for me it turns into a grind of constantly figuring out the math and rolling dice.  I want to love this game, but I quickly wish that it would end after 10 minutes of play time.

I'm really enjoying this game, even if I did get thumped on my second game. The strategy's still a mystery to me, however - though I expect that will change.

I like how the order systems in this game works, so you can only give 3 orders a round instead of controlling every troop on the board at the same time.  This is a miniatures game with cards instead of figures, which is why it is rated low for me as I am not the biggest fan of miniature games.  But, if I ever feel the need to play a minis game I will play this instead.

I have many armies:  Orcs, Dwarves, Elves, Undead

Pretty easy entry to miniature gaming without the miniatures.  The variety of races and tactical options when deploying, moving and building your army make for a lot of replayability and color.  

But once the armies actually make contact, it kind of turns into a dice fest.  Very inexpensive.

This game was a lot of fun!

Simple, inexpensive components, fairly easy combat system, and a great command system.

I do think the movement rules are clunky as anything I've ever played though.  I guess that it would be difficult to do anything better with cards as your component though.

The rules are a bit difficult to read, but not unmanageable.

Still, overall a great game, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting something different wargame-wise.

If you want to play a unit-based miniatures game but *don't* want to spend time or money on miniatures and painting, then this is your game!

A nice, tight little game.

A miniatures game, in every aspect except the lack of miniatures. The rule system is excellent: limited command points lead to some tough decisions, and standing orders mean that you can hit the middle ground between "out of command units don't move" and "I am a Dark Ages general with 21st century communications". Portable, easy to get into for both new adopters and veterans, and very quick to set up: no painting or assembly required. I do miss 3D models, but honestly if I had fantasy miniatures I'd probably look for ways to combine these rules with the figures.

Great order system and really nice overhead representation of units (the slightly cheesy CG close-ups aren't great, but the top-down on the battlefield cards is fantastic) places it a step ahead of Diskwars for "minis without the minis" gameplay.

I own the Hawkshold Army.  An interesting game that does remind me a lot of the minis games I used to play (frustrations and all ;) ).  Great fun, looking forward to customising the armies a little more and beating up on some dirty Lizardmen.

A much better alternative to the Games Workshop Warhammer Fantasy than anything else I have seen. The combat system and determining what you need to roll to hit and wound is much easier and makes more sense than the Warhammer rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Battleground Fantasy Warfare is a highly detailed tactical miniatures rules set masquerading as a card game. Instead of model figures, units are represented by cards that display the overhead view of the individual figures. The cards are moved around the table like minis, and orders can be issued to each card by writing on the card in dry-erase. Changing orders for any unit expends a limited number of command points. Unit stats are also printed on the cards and damage is marked off by dry-erase on the card.

In a nutshell, the use of cards make it a cheap alternative to miniatures gaming, backed up by a sophisticated ruleset that rivals the gameplay of any other fantasy minis game. The horrible CGI artwork on the cards is the game's only real drawback, but the game got a new owner in 2016, and they're looking to upgrade that as well with ongoing releases.

The game's emphasis on command and control creates a complex tactical decision environment. Additionally, players maintain a hand of specialty order command cards that can be played at any time. Command decks and other unique powers vary from faction to faction, making for a diverse set of possible match-ups.

A point-based system for army building and deployment creates intense challenges before the first turn even begins.

Battleground benefits from a small but intensely active and dedicated fanbase. Tournaments occur at several annual conventions, strongly supported by the publisher.

This succeeds where I feel Command and Colors: Ancients fails. It delivers a more accurate and more stream-lined simulation of ancients warfare than C&C does (despite being fantasy themed) while providing equally nice components and costing *much* less. It's a very elegant design, rivaling games such as Bonaparte at Marengo in terms of innovation. Much underrated on BGG.

I heard a rumor that an Ancients themed version of this game is in the works.

Great concept, allowing players to play miniature style war games cheaply.

Seen the game and tried it out. As a miniatures gamer, I love the portability, viability, design, and  the way it resembles a fantasy miniatures game, including tactical decisions such as moving the forces around and strategic issues such as what forces to bring. Of course, the (comparable) cheapness to a full miniatures game is also a huge help. 

My only two criticisms:

First, this game is just released, and more variety in army choices, units available, and others areas is greatly desired (For a Fantasy Warfare game, where's my elves and dwarves?). Also, the additional of leader units to represent leaders / heroes on the field would be greatly desired. 

Second, the points cost for the units needs to be standardized - if this game is to be touted as game where all you need is two decks and some friends to play, you need to be able to do the math in your head - at very least, round off the point values to the nearest 10.

What the game industry really needs right now if it's going to survive is new concepts and new ways of presenting established ones- Battleground: Fantasy Warfare rises to the challenge and not only is it an accessible, fairly realistic tactical battle system , it's also a fairly novel presentation.  Drawing from card-based games like Wings of War, BFW is more or less an ancients-style miniature game that uses cards instead of miniatures.  The result is something similar to Warhammer (imagine the cards as movement trays) but without the scientology-like marketing and price structure of Games Workshop.  The major drawbacks to the game are the absolutely inexcusable and amateurish CGI artwork and typesetting (I know it was probably a budgetary thing, but the game looks cheap) and a somewhat confusing rulebook.  The system is one of the most concise I've ever seen and the addition of special action cards add some fun unpredictability.  I think this is a great release that needs a little more professional "push" behind it, Your Move Games really needs to believe in this product a little more and let it develop as it needs to and this could be a classic.

I like miniatures gaming but I have no inclination or talent for painting so this suits me down to the ground. The armies are interesting and I like the rules system which is better than most wargames rules I've played. Even better is the excellent support in the form of scenarios published by Yourmove. My fantasy battle game of choice.
I have:
Men of Hawkshold - very nice solid, balanced army.
Undead - my first deck, I have a lot of affection for them. Nothing like shambling hordes of Zombies & Death Knights that always fail their first morale test.
Orcs - Goblin chaff & Orky brutality.
Umenzi - very interesting, very vulnerable.
Wood Elves - boy, these guys rock! (except the archers who get outgunned every time by Goblins)
Dwarves - slow but steady & very tough. Good missile support.
High Elves
Lizardmen - Tough boys these, and even worse in the closing stages when the Blood Frenzy kicks in.
Monsters & Mercs
Kingdoms - great battle generator.
Dark Elves - interesting take on DE's with hordes of cheap spearmen, no archers, some savage troops & wicked spells. 

---------------------------------------------
And for what was Historical:
On a flying visit back to SA for my mum's 70th, I took this along to keep me amused. I set up the Cannae battle using the suggestions for the solo game and it gave me a very enjoyable couple of afternoons. The distinct rules for light skirmishers made an interesting change on the Fantasy battles as well as the slightly less-punchy cavalry. I like very much how the historical troops are depicted - hard-hitting but brittle Gauls, more skillful Spanish Troops and the great Roman meat-grinder. I think it's the best representation of the Roman manipular system that I have seen. (January 2010)

Picked up two starters (Men and Orcs) at KublaCon 2006. Nice lightweight mini-style game. Strain inducing GW-style wristage (each unit requires two rolls of a good four or so dice on attack), but the order system is pretty clever; Each unit can do basic things each turn, but to change or do complex actions requires spending limited command points. Lacks the full on visual impact of minis, but very inexpensive and incredibly portable. Addendum: Bought the rest of the decks from Thoughthammer at the nearly give-away price of less than $10.00 each. The reinforcement decks are an excellent deal as they give you more units than you could reasonably put on the table at once. With such a low buy-in cost (a starter and reinforcement deck are only $20 discount, $30 full retail) you can field an army with a plethora of options available. A little worried about some of the powerful elites, though. The bomb-chucker, for example, has few drawbacks (slow movement and ~17% misfire rate) but can hit darn near anywhere on the table with 3-11 dice at 5/6. You're looking at 21% hit rate against even tough foes like the Knights. Just a couple of turns from that and most units will break if not be eliminated outright. 
Added Dwarves and Tribemen at Kubla 2007. Still think this system is great.

A fantasy skirmish game without the enormous pricetag, the hassle of paiting a gazillion miniatures and the ability to fit an entire army in your pocket. What's not to like?

Well, some day I might have the inclination to play a fantasy skirmish game again, and then this will be perfect :)

Like miniatures, but with cards.  Lots of dice, but cards can modify it and use of tactics and special character abilities can moderate it as well.  This may end up getting more play than our minis based games just because they will be so much easier to set up!

I had such high hopes for the game, but they were utterly shattered after I played this.  Often when I do not like a a game, I will give it another shot to solidify or adjust my perception.  I do not need another play.  The rules are not intuitive (especially movement), the game stalls, and it is simply not fun.

Gets an extra point for scratching the fantasy army itch without costing over a thousand dollars.  Could be looked at as a straight conversion of WFB with cards replacing movement trays, but the standing orders system is brilliant and makes the game even deeper than Warmaster (the more strategic version of WFB).  If you can get over the feeling of Minis Snobbery and let yourself play this, you'll wonder why you ever got in to WFB in the first place.

Edit 9-7: When playing in the wild, the lack of structure works against it in that you can make incredibly twinky army lists.  I shouldn't have to put boundries on the game, that's the designer's job.

7-8: Oh hey, they patched army construction.  Core units now like Warhammer.  And at the same time, someone came up with a variant to draft armies like a CCG.  Gotta find someone to play this with again.

8-9: The more I play this the more in love I become.  Making armies with the Core-Elite system is awesome, but more importantly the Scenario support from Kingdoms makes every fight different.  10-odd scenarios times 20-odd terrain layouts?  Yes please!

9-10: I never thought a game could achieve the heights of awesome as Blood Bowl.  But here it is.  Every good thing about point system large scale fantasy war, none of the bad things.  Scenario generation is nigh infinite.  I play a 10 game campaign and want to start a new one the next day.  I think about battles.  I take pictures of games.  And $25 plus zero hours of work gets you everything you need for all the war your dice can handle.

RATING: 5
Fantasy based "miniatures" game, actually played with on a deck of cards.  The cards show different formations of troops "goblin raiders", "orc axemen", etc, in nicely rendered computer art.  The game plays entirely like a simple miniatures system - the cards are issued orders, which they follow unless you spend command to override their orders.  Combat is a simple Warhammer based system, rolling against respective skills to gain hits, hits are rolled against toughness to actually reduce units.  A deck of tactics cards allows some modifiers to be added at crucial times.  Advanced rules add terrain, etc.  Nice compact game, well thought out.  Good stuff.

RATING: 5
Nothing special. Great thing is that it isn't collectible - once you buy starter and reinforcement, you've "collected eevrything". 

Game has balance problems, with some races so obviously stronger than other (undead and especially lizardmen are really too much). 

Good thing is that it doesn't last long, you don't need to pack any miniature, so you get fast-paced war-game withouth collectible part, and withouth painting.

Graphics on the cards (released so far (mercenary are last faction at this moment)) are extremly ugly, and main reason why more people don't play the game in my town.

Best played with kingdoms expansion (campaign and scenarios). Terrain is also "must have".

RATING: 9.5
Great miniatures-style game-play without the miniatures. Devs are very active in clarifying, simplifying, and balancing the rules. Very cheap. Basically, if you want to play a miniature game without all the time (to assemble/paint) spend in setup and without the usually unnecessarily complex rules, this is your game. It also has a few genuinely new and interesting concepts such as orders and command points. Highly recommended. Only wish that the command cards were more flavorful (gameplay mechanics are fine, just wish that Undead and Humans wouldn't have the same defensive cards called "Parry" etc, could have been a bit more creative on that aspect, but this is being picky).

UPDATE: 9-> 9.5; Great rule support from the devs. Once again, just a great game.

A wargame, without the miniatures. At first I was sceptical about it, but it is really fantastic!
Much more streamlined than warhammer (all the nitpicky rules are disposed of) and you can get a 3000pt army for 15 euro. And this army is indeed huge. But if you want more of it, you can buy a reinforcement deck and quadruple the army size (if not more).

I really like it. It replaces warhammer for me, since that is so long, nitpicky, expensive and takes a huge amount of space.

I'm not a miniatures fanatic for so many reasons but mostly because of the fidgety nature of measuring and whatnot.  BFW goes through hoops to smoothen this by offering an impressive game with more manageable ressources.  I like the idea of cards instead of the truck load of components which some game demand (hello Warhammer).  We did manage to make sense of the rules and play a game.  It was fun and I'm going to get some.  The command structure makes for an imperfect control of the battlefield which I find brilliant.  There is plenty of room for strategy and tactics and I'm sufficiently impressed to get my own army to tinker with.

RATING: 7
A brilliant concept well executed. I don't have the patience to work with miniatures, so Battleground offers me an affordable, non-collectible and easily transportable version of the battles. The rules are simple enough to keep the game flowing, yet deep enough to offer lots of meaningful strategic choices. Especially the concept of standing orders is ingenious, as it makes the battlefield a truly dynamic place.

My only complaint is certain lack of variety. Different races each have their own flavor, but only a dozen different units per side does not quite fulfill my yearning for building different armies and combinations.

I currently own all fantasy armies (basic set & reinforcements), except for the dark Elves.

  Battleground is a quite unique game of tactical maneuvering units represented solely with cards. That's the reason that makes this game highly portable and really cheap. 
  Overall, beautiful artwork and mechanism of gameplay. 

On the other hand, the game desperately demands videos of gameplay. Especially the movement phase is hard to clarify and can really turn a nice session into a mess.

The game that scratches my miniature wargaming itch--without the pain of glueing or painting! 

If you haven't tried their system for warfare, you should. This game merits the attempt because of originality and sheer genius of what it attempted (and succeeded)at doing.

And, what makes it a "9" in my book is the dollar value of play. $30 gets you everything you need for an army.

Not a bad attempt at obtaining minatures feel without the expense. However, the rulebook as it stands (I have the second edition rules) is a bit clumsy. Balance between unit strength and cost also feels very out of balance in places.

A superb miniatures rule set that you can get involved with for a 30$ investment. (Yup, 30$ will give you an entire faction to play with).

It does a good job at what it tries to do: be a miniatures game without the miniatures. All the annoyances are still there: fiddly measuring movements, a combat resolution table a mile long, and annoying amounts of arithmetic. The actual movement here is barely used. The two armies rush at each other and beat on each other with dice until one dies. Armies are forced to move towards the closest thing, and leaving a battle lets the enemy take easy shots at you. So there are no strategic choices of movement. Additionally, since all units attack, there are no strategic choices of what to attack with. The most tactical decision you make is whether to draw cards or issue orders and of course what cards you draw is very chancey. I can see why people would like this, but it defintely isn't for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just like many others have said this is a fantasy (or historical if you're playing Rome v. Carthage) miniatures game that uses cards with a top-down view of troops to represent stands of minis. All of the combat stats are on the card, eliminating the need for record sheets. It's a good combat system, basically attack dice with skill (combat prowess) and power (how hard you hit) derived target numbers modified by the defender's defensive skill and toughness. Morale status and damage capacity/hits taken are the same track. This is all maintained on the card with a dry-erase marker. Routing, ranged attacks of different types, a good list of modifiers for a range of battlefield situations, and a good orders-based command system are just some of the rules concepts in BGFW and everything one would expect from a tactical minis game without the minis. There's magic but it is simplified and very playable, not requiring a whole subset of rules. Going by BGG's weight scale I have rated the rules as 2-Light Medium with my "yardstick" being rules complexity of other minis games I've played. Any experienced miniatures wargamer will understand the rules immediately and the non-minis gamers I've played with have caught on by the end of their first game. I'm new to the system as of 2/2012 and am using the 3.0 rules from Dark Elves. There are a couple of ambiguities in the rules, from what I understand this is an improvement from earlier versions, a quick look at BGG or the Your Move Games forum will clear up any rules questions.  

The factions I've played so far are very distinctive from one another and all have their own flavor and tactics suited to them. The army building options (customization of forces) for each faction with a starter and reinforcement pack are very impressive; you'll get a whole lot of army for $20-$30, depending on where you buy from. This is much better than spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on miniatures armies and spending all that time painting. I've spent decades of my life maintaining miniatures armies, fleets, and air forces but for fantasy at least I will never have to do so again thanks to Battleground Fantasy Warfare.

TL;DR 
This fantasy wargame is fun, playable, thematic, and cheap.

Imagine vast armies and a ruleset similar to Warhammer Fantasy.  Now cut the price by 95% ($30 buys you ALL the units in an army), the painting and modeling costs by 100%, and the transportation needs out completely and you have Battleground.  Using cards to both measure and represent your movements (with good CG artwork), it emulates the tabletop experience to a tee.  Less space is needed, gameplay is quicker, and the rules allow for everything but solo characters (terrain, psychology, army traits).  Well-balanced and gritty fun.

Well, the game suffers from the standard miniatures game problems while abandoning the time-honored aspects of the genre most would consider sacrilege.  Its very dice heavy, has hints of minor unbalances, and perhaps is a bit too long for what it is.  Sure, not having to paint and assemble is nice, but its still a miniatures game when the day is over and done with and consequently carries its stigma.  I will say the command point mechanic is quite brilliant in evoking the field general feeling, however, and should be commended for its prowess.

A quite interesting approach on the miniature warfare theme.  The limited command system makes for a more realistic approach than the Warhammer micromanagement approach, and the absence of uber-figures able to wade through countless troops is refreshing.

All the games I played so far were close, and it seems the game was well playtested.  Recommended if you are even remotely interested in miniature warfare games.  The non-collectible approach makes BFW a non-expensive game to try, and an enjoyable one to play.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy its qualities.  With the addition of terrain and new armies, there is always something new to experience.  And I can't wait to field an historical Roman army!

Well, the good is that it is a decent and very cheap miniature game.  Because it is basically just a deck of cards, it is also very portable.

Miniature gaming isn't my thing, yet somehow I like this.  It takes all the chores (painting minute details, setting up hundreds of figures, carrying around huge boxes of orcs, building elaborate maps, shelling out tons of cash) out of the thing, and strips it down to the fun part: stuff beating up other stuff real good.  Good times, good times.  I give it a 6 for the game itself as it can be a touch fiddly what with the measuring and all...but a 10 for the idea and the execution.  One of those smack yourself in the forehead "Why didn't I think of that?" kind of ideas.  So...maybe an eight overall.

This is an awesome game to play, and I love to play it.  The only thing that keeps it from a 10 is that there is some fiddliness in the battles with all the dice rolling and such.  I don't know that, it could be avoided without hurting the game though, so its a great game.

The decision making and strategy in this game is awesome.

Passable game but it's no Warhammer killer.  The idea is well executed but the game play isn't as tight as WFB and the restriction on unit special abilities makes the units less interesting.  Obviously, the visual impact isn't even close but the portability is worth something but probably not too much.

My review : http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/116906

Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a steal of a deal and a very cool non-collectible game. It solves my miniature gaming wants, it doesn't take up space, and it left me money to buy other games as well. It's flexible and it's fun. A neat design idea! 

It's all the miniature gaming I'd wanted with none of the time or money needed for the miniatures themselves. 

It separates out two different hobbies: the miniature painting/sculpting hobby from the gaming hobby itself. 

That said though 3D miniatures (and terrain) do create a fantastic look for people who can afford the time and expense; you could play this game with actual figures if you wanted: create figure bases with the proper "middle" markings on each side, put your squads on the bases, and then use the Battleground cards as play aids and life tracks to total damage on.

I grew up on Warhammer Fantasy, and while cards can't compare to a table full of painted minis, Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a great option for a working adult. The rules are straightforward, and avoid many of the trickier aspects of Warhammer. The armies are varied, portable, and cheap. For those of you who dreamed of owning every army in your favorite minis game, look no further. A good intro into the minis hobby for youngsters (my son and I had a blast playing our first game), and a great option for time-strapped adults. Only an 8 for me because I am not always in the mood for tabletop war games. It succeeds nearly perfectly at what it attempts.

A great way to get the gameplay of a large scale miniatures title with the cost and effort of a card game.  Differs from most minis games by the use of a Command Point system, which gives you less options and therefore forces you to prioritize what you need to have change the most (this is a good thing).  I've played it about a dozen times and have had fun organizing an army and a battle plan and seeing it through in each battle... even in the losses.

I'm sure the game is great once you know how to play it - but the rule book is so incredibly bad that we never managed to understand it. I'm not talking about rare or ambiguous situations, but basic rules for movement etc. In addition to this there are several contradictory versions of the rules out and it is virtually impossible to find a common ruling on many of them. It seems like a game you have  to learn directly from someone who already knows it.

Got Men and Undead from Chad to playtest/review.  i look foward to playing this and writing up an honest opinion on a very "hot" game of late.
Will it live up to the hype?
I'll say this much; I always liked the idea behind miniature games, but could never deal with the measuring/transporting/painting/expense of said games.
This just may solve my personal problem with the genre.

I really like units continuing to follow orders after you issue them; that makes this a lot better than other miniatures games I've played.

This is a small little wargame.  The cards take the place of the models you'd have to laboriously paint otherwise.  The real bonus of this game is that as a general you set things in motion and spend the rest of the battle trying to keep the plates all in the air.  Your troops function without your attention, but you need to keep putting your focus (command points) to get the best benefit from each skirmish in the battle.

Ken:
Great alternative to the more expensive, space-, and time-consuming miniatures wargames out there.  Still has, to a limited degree, the complexity (in the advanced rules) to satisfy that itch.  Sadly, it appears that tabletop wargaming without the aesthetic appeal doesn't pull me in.  Further, tactical wargaming started for me on the PC, and, lacking the aesthetic/tactile minis, might as well be played on that platform.

Unlikely to play in the future.  I can play PC games which offer me more tactical options, no set up time, higher aesthetic appeal, and a significantly lower learning curve.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Wishlist: Looking for Dwarves and Mercs, all decks. 

Update 9: With the addition of Kingdoms, the system now really shines!


Update 8: Still an excellent game. Rating adjusted based on how often it makes it to the table. 

10: After a few plays, I'm ready to say this is an awesome game! The game LOOKS great: a line of battle advancing and mixing it up. It plays simply (with lots of modifiers to keep track of, though) and yet is challenging to play well. It's non-collectable aspect is appreciated and the decks provide a good array of units to field. Bttleground is one of those games that you finish and then have a good story to tell as well as an inescapable urge to go back over the battle in your mind and in your post game conversation.

RATING: 2
I don't like that game for several things.  The movement of the cards is all linked to size of the sides of the cards that make it untidy they should have use the hex system.  Also to keep track of your health you have to wrote on the card itself.  The artwork is below average. The power of the unit is printed in the back of the card that is not really good since you will have to flip it during play and you never get them back in the same place. The rules are not clear and it's difficult to figure out the basic mechanics, but leave a lot of question to be answered in the basic rules. You need A total re-write of the rules is needed.

Verdaderamente es un juego de miniaturas con cartas. Hay que medir, tirar dados y activar a las tropas. Creo que la última fue mi parte favorita, tienes que darle órdenes a cada uno de los ejércitos y no pararán de realizarla hasta que les des otra. No fui muy fan, pero entiendo que haya gente a la que le guste mucho, más por la cantidad de tropas que tiene y el poco espacio que ocupa.

The system this company developed is a solid rules set that plays like a real miniatures game.  There are some holes in the rules but most of the questions are already answered here on the geek.  The only game play issue I have is that I do not see there being a log of maneuver in the game.  The game plays more like battlelines advancing forwards and clashing.  Still the game is wonderful and I would play anytime.  I am hoping to get at least a couple of more friends involved in the game.

Update:  As the years pass by, I like this game less and less.  I like the portability and the general mechanics but there are still some rules questions and there really is no maneuvering in the game.

I purchased the game simply because I liked the idea of not having to paint my own minis, and I thought (wrongly) that this was a 'euro' take on the mini genre. I was wrong, but it's still a good game :) 
Things I like:
- No painting 
- Order mechanism very cool
- Cheap and endlessly expandable
- generates lots of tactics/opportunities for angst
Things I didn't like:
- Rule book needs major overhaul
- It's a minis game. This means lots of tiny little exceptions, rules that will only apply once in a blue moon that need to be remembered, etc. 
- No scenarios a real bummer

It is fairly easy to remedy one of my qualms about the game; I simply play ignoring the tiny little exceptions and clutter my brain with thinking about tactics instead of thinking about whether I'm following the rules or not. My other major qualm (no scenarios) is probably the biggest factor affecting my rating; this game could've been an 8/8.5 otherwise.

Update: I'll add to my list of dislikes the fact that units loose fighting ability as they are hit; this seems to favour the player who is luckiest earlier in the game.

Own the High Elves starter and reinforcement, Umenzi Tribesmen starter and reinforcement, and Mercenary reinforcment decks.

Played once with the humans, ten times with the high-elves, and a few times with the Umenzi using the Kingdoms scenario generator.

This is a tabletop, unit-based wargame with a brilliant twist: there are no chits or miniatures to represent the units.  Instead, each company of units is a single card, and the card itself is moved around the tabletop as the unit moves.  The cards can be written on with dry-erase markers, so damage to the unit and changes to their status and orders can just be written on the card.  No more fiddling with miniature cavalry as they race across the board, or figuring out how many chits to remove to indicate the damage.  

The game also has a great command scheme: units are set out on the first turn, and each unit is then given an order.  Orders including Hold (stay in one place), Charge (head to the nearest enemy and attack), Range (close to your maximum firing distance and shoot the closest thing), Follow (move towards your closest ally) and various modifications of those.  The modifications include things like Charging to a specific point on the map before attacking the closest enemy, shooting at range with a specific unit as priority, moving at a maximum speed, or following a specific unit.  This is all shown by writing things on the cards.

The first game of this had a steep learning curve - there are a lot of rules, a ton of numbers, even more modifiers to those numbers, and the programming takes a while to get used to (e.g., what happens when two units with programs come close to each other, how do units deal with running into other units, what's "being in a terrain" mean, ... etc.).  That slowed things down, but once I got used to it, things sped up greatly.  The first game took 3-4 hours with rules, now that I've played 4 games they're down to less than 2.  

After the first game I wrote: I'm curious how things will go now that I understand the basics: will the game speed up enough to be fun?  My first game was 3+ hours, including rules.  Will the programming and collision rules become clear enough to make each game not devolve into rules-manual checking?  Only time will tell.   Now that I've played more, I can say that the game is good enough to keep playing.  But you've got to have a good reference sheet, and have to get familiar with the rules so the game can go quickly.

I've started this out at a 7.5; if the future games go better then it could easily go much higher.

[Updated after 8 games: I've gotten a much better feel for the game and the units, including how important battlefield tactics are (pinching is key!).  The game is turning into a beautiful 3-hour brain-burning tactical fest; I LOVE it.]

RATING: 8
This all comes together for me very well. Easier and more cost effective to get into than true table-top miniatures. More portable, needs less space... pretty much ticks all the boxes for me. Yes, it is not a replacement for the cool awesomeness of moving gorgeous miniature armies  across a battlefield but its the next best thing for me if I want a similar experience. I really like Battlefield Historical Warfare: Second Punic War 218-201 on a lot of levels. It is gorgeous to look at, it plays clearly, computes the movement, combat and routs easily, and most of all is a load of fun. Its not as straightforward as Command & Colors: Ancients, for example and you need more time to play it, and yes, miniatures-style games are fiddly in movement and calculations but you know what? I can't wait to play again!

btw - it seems some folks have complained that you can't play it without the Reinforcements set and that is sheer nonsense. You can easily play with the basic set. The large scenarios that come with the Reinforcements set require the extra cards but either way, there is tremendous value for money due to the replayability.

This game was the only way I would ever get to play a mass battle wargame. The rules are intuitive and (while a little clumsily written) are easy to get your head around, despite it being far from a 'light' wargame, and they marry realism of command and game enjoyment very well. The cards are of good quality and each fulfills the role of a £15 box of miniatures even better than the figures would, thanks to everything you need being on the cards themselves.

Only the (to me sluggish) nature of the mass battle genre itself, and a few spotty areas in the writing of the rules, prevented me from enjoying it more and giving a higher score. However, this is a great system, and combined with such affordable armies it wins out over any similar game hands down.

There are a ton of modifiers, but I think with a few plays, this will become a very fun, very quick minature/wargame.  I think this plays like minis with some hex and counter concpets thrown in.

I own Orc and Elves.  I've played against the Undead.

Nice replacement for those who want the miniature game experiences without the miniatures. But then, if you are using cards, do you really want all the endless measuring and arranging tediousness that comes with miniatures if you are not rewarded with the same visual splendour for your efforts? You have to decide that for yourself.

I thought I had seen enough skirmish games already but this one is really good.

Armies of miniatures represented by MtG-sized cards. An unique idea that works very well. Another great idea is the standing order command system, meaning indirect control over your troops. Also, orders and damage are marked directly on the cards using dry-erase markers.

The combat system has just the right amount of complexity, and combat resolution runs smoothly. Movement is done like in Pirates CSG, using card lengths.

Have humans, orcs, elf starter, and undead starter.  Big amount of game in a small package, with a minimum of muss and fuss other than die rolling.  Rules are clear, and its a great introduction to miniatures flavoring without all the expensive and time-consuming trappings.  Still, I'm a Euro and boardwargaming kind of guy, and so opportunities to hit the table will be few.  Looking for the other starter and booster packs.

This fits the bill of where I want to avoid minis, and where there are few / no hex-&-counter wargames in this genre.  Plays fast in a relaxed style once you have the hang of the system and can have a nice commentary value.  The cards are the key as they add variety, replayability and generally, enough to the game to have me overlooking the dice fest that the combat system is (not to mention I think they give a boost to soliatire play), which I typically seek to avoid.  After 3 playings I am also impressed with the balance that the matches have as all 3 games have virtually come down to the last clash between 1-2 opposing units.  Lastly - it's inexpensive to get into and requires little to no overhead in space or extras beyond the cards although the terrain pack will add depth to any match.

The ‘entire package’ is absolutely awesome. Some things I really like:
1.	Scalability – You can have small skirmish level encounters or huge battles; simply add cards (which are CHEAP compared to miniatures).
2.	No Painting – I’ve been waiting for a good miniature type game that doesn’t require hours of painting. Too tedious for me.
3.	Balance – Seems very well balanced. Strategy lies in unit/unit match up and typical table top strategies (e.g. flanking).
4.	Presentation – ‘Top Down’ artwork of the units is really nice looking. Looks great when played on a green surface.
5.	Measurements – All game measurements are a function of the card sizes. Not much need for rulers/measure tapes. 
6.	Flip Up Card Stats – All stats / special abilities are on the card backs. Which seems odd at first, but they are printed reverse from the army side. So, you can simply ‘peak’ under the unit without moving it to see all the abilities.
7.	Damage Tracking – Simple, you place your cards in sleeves and track damage by checking off boxes in the damage section on the unit card.
8.	Reuse of Existing Terrain – I can reuse everything I already have for fantasy gaming.

In my mind, the game would be a ‘10’ if siege rules were included in the initial game. 

Enjoy!

An interesting approach to bring figure tabletop wargame rules to card gaming. Easy and fast playing system. Armies suffers losses and attrition that must be tracked using level coloured boxed printed on the own card surface. I do not like this because it damage the cards and force players to renew cards after several playings. So, if you play many, you need to buy many. This is because I rate a bit low this system. Good game anyway including all expansions

I like how the system is based around "standing orders" that are difficult to modify once the battle begins.  Conditional standing orders starts to get too fiddley.

The core system is pretty good, but has waaaaaay too many special cases that are not at all easy to remember (e.g. when you get a +1 bonus to hit vs. to wound).  They were a bit too much influenced by Warhammer and ended up perhaps even more special-cased.

Thematically, the game is pretty dry for something that is suppose to be about fantasy.  The system can live without theme to prop it up, but it's a missed opportunity.

--Apr2009-- One messy attempt at a play.  I'm still not clear on the movement rules.  And my opponent wasn't much better off.  So our lines crashed into one another and we rolled dice.  A lot.

Nice tabletop battlegame.  The idea of buidling an army and playing right away with the cards is nice.  Dice can be borrowed from other games.  Dry erase markers work well on cards.  The combat and tactical depth is good and allows a great deal of flexibility.  Special abilities and stats for units seem well balanced.  Other special powers for particular units would be nice.  Perhaps a rudimentary magic system given the fantasy setting.  If you are interested in tactical combat games this is a nice portable game.

Orc Starter Deck. Umenzi starter + reinforcement, Men starter + reinforcement.

Sure, it's cheaper than 'real' miniatures and you don't have to paint anything.

In reality, you're paying $15 for a deck of cards. You need to buy 2 decks to have a decent battle. You need to supply your own dry erase marker and dice.

This essentially means a $30-35 investment...ouch. 

It's a great idea nonethless but for those interested in the game, Caveat Emptor.

I have fun with the two armies I own.  I don't care for the orders rule as I prefer to be able to move freely in my games.  I can see why they did it from an army commander perspective, so it is not a groundbreaker for me.  Very affordable game that I am always willing to play.

RATING: 7.5
a guilty pleasure. i held off on B:FW while i (too) slowly built up a Warmaster army. but B:FW's price just couldn't be beat ($20 for wood elf and undead starter packs on Amazon).

while a miniatures-less miniatures game would seem to defeat the purpose, and the CGI is terribly outdated, the gameplay here is well worth it. 

tight, straight-forward rules. extra depth is provided by command cards and unit and army-race abilities. the card material, data presentation, and player aids are all quality. all that's missing is some kind of 1-sheet with a summarized turn sequence and list of abilities. but i bet i can find that on the Geek.

in short, B:FW distills all those charts and modifiers from those big-book miniatures games and puts it where it's most useful and convenient. bravo!

what can i say? for years, i've been wanting to put together armies of miniatures. this game re-ignited that desire. with B:FW, at least i can start playing right away.

lastly, i mention the Star Wars PocketModel game in other reviews as a kind of baseline for lite, inexpensive, make-sound-effects-with-your-mouth fun. SWPM has its flaws, however. making lazer and rocket sounds can only take you so far when the gameplay isn't compelling. 

B:FW is compelling.

This one seems highly overrated.  I really don't play games with minatures, and this experience didn't really help.  What's the point of the graphics?  The individuals on the card mean nothing.

Loads of fun. I love how you keep track of the stats on the cards themselves and how for $30 you get so many units you don't know what to do with them. My only complaint is that our first game took FOREVER. But I think that once we get the hang of the rules we could cut the time it took in half. There are so many modifiers to the dice rolls it's a bit tricky and overwhelming to keep track of them all at first, but it's a minis game so that's pretty normal. (Update: Our second game did indeed take about half as long as the first game)

This design has replaced miniatures for me...period. Battleground: Fantasy Warfare beats miniatures in all but one category: visuals. I don't like the computer-generated graphics that much (and no way can 2-D cards replace minis, hence the '9' rating) but this is a minor nit. In the areas of portability, price, preparation and, most importantly, rules; this is a fantastic value. The mechanics of the game are far superior to anything else I've played. I urge anyone who enjoys miniatures-style gaming and great games in general to give this product a try. You won't be disappointed!

Overall a good game.  

Pros: very nice concept, inexpensive yet attractive.  Basic rules are sound, and the ability to track losses (and the effects of damage on a unit) is excellent.  I really like the dry-erase marker on the cards - great idea!  I love the standing orders rule - great stuff, well executed.  Extra rules, variants, FAQ, etc., available on the publisher's website for free.  One starter set allows you to play a game to see if you like it - nicely done.  No randomization of cards - not a CCG, thank you!  Can be used with Hordes of the Things rules if you want (a simpler set of rules). 

Cons: There's a bit too much "fiddliness" involved for every battle.  "Let's see, I roll five dice and my offensive skill is 5 and your defensive skill is 2, so I hit on a roll of three or lower.  Now I reroll those that hit and my damage-dealing ability is 4, minus your damage-resistance ability of 2..."  It's not as bad as I make it sound, but you have to do it every battle - slows the game down.

Still a very good game, mind you, and the con is what brings it down to a 7.

Great tactical game that is easy on storage. My complaint is most of the outcome is established in the army build and deployment. But there is a ton that can happen due to dice. So it isn't a completely forgone conclusion.

Side: if you can get the space and time to increase the board size and greatly increase the army size the game is very interesting and the high lights/specials of each factions seem to show through more.

This is actually a fun little game that plays like the big-boys.  It feels like a miniatures game, but requires little set-up time and no painting.  Add to the fact that you can fit 4 armies in the same volume that the rulebook for Warhammer occupies.  But, of course, it still suffers from all the problems you can find in any miniatures game--potential for arguments and whining over measurements, shifted units, etc.  I will keep it and play on ocassion, but it's definitely not on the frequent-player list.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  Okay I am not a big minatures guy to begin with, but sometimes am in the mood for one.  If I ever was to get one it would have to be cheap which is where this game comes in.  I played an orc vs orc battle.  It was a decent game and I enjoyed the battle despite getting whooped.  The coolest part is how the units just keep doing the order you tell them too until they can't anymore, where other minis games like Heroscape you have to give then an order each turn or they do nothing.  It gives this game a unique feel, like you are more of a general giving high level orders.  I now have 1 orc starter army deck.

Still getting this one to the table a lot thanks to one of my game groups and the Kingdoms campaign game.  The game is now in it's 5th rules version (or so) and the changes have not all been intuitive.  Some of them have left me scratching my head.

As much as I like the idea of Historical Gaming miniatures, and the content and theme.  I just absolutely do not click well with miniatures style gaming.  I've tried it off and on over the years and the rulers, subjective style movement, and the overall terrain objectives, coupled with the 'buckets of dice' combat resolution is just not something that I enjoy or click well with.

Great game and with 1,500 point armies plays in 120 mins or less. Dropping a half point only because because the CG art is ok (if a bit bland and hard to make out) in the top down view but poor in the close up views on the card backs and command cards. 

One tip is don't use water soluble markers on the cards, only use the recommended dry erase markers.

Demo this at conventions with the latest being Gen Con 2008.  Seems like a very interesting system, but already into Warhammer 40K for my minis fix when not playing the euros.
My rating is based on my desire to play - has nothing to do with rules or how good the game is.

RATING: 5
Has space to be an interesting system, but overly granular nature really gets in the way.  Combat takes one roll of several dice to see if you hit, and then a reroll of some of the dice to see if you do any damage.  This is cool in theory, but in implementation, it's quite tedious.  Similarly, many hitpoints per unit mean that a unit can take an awful lot of punishment before running.  I prefer the more typical 2-hit system of games that flip the counter over once to show disruption, and then remove it.  

The game was designed as a replacement for a miniatures game, and it gets there, mechanically.  The problem is, most minis gamers see the miniatures as an integral part of their hobby, and deservedly so.  It is impressive to see a terrain spread and fully set up miniatures game, in a way that a deck of cards will never be able to recreate.

If you invested a lot of time and effort into this system, there's probably something here, but it's hard to justify that energy when there are other skirmish games that are so much better out of the box.

Minis for those with no painting skills (me).  Also can get an entire army for $12usd instead of $100 or more.  Very nicely balanced armies.  Tons and tons of dice rolling.  Fun and plays quickly.

Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a point-based table-top tactical wargame in which units are represented by cards instead of a collection of figures or models. We bring you all the charging, flanking and intricate maneuvering of a great wargame in a convenient package for a fraction of the cost.
\13\\13\
As the general of a fantasy army of Men, Orcs, Elves or whatever faction you choose, you will muster your forces and command them in battle. You will have an agreed-upon number of points to spend on your army, which will determine the size of the battle. You and your opponent will then take turns deploying your forces on the battlefield. Finally you will give them their orders and the battle begins.
\13\\13\
During play you will have a limited number of Command Actions each turn – one for every 500 points available for building your army. These Command Actions represent what you can do as a general. You can spend them to change a unit’s orders or take direct control of a unit for a turn, rally routed units, draw cards that can provide small combat bonuses or to use your special army ability.
\13\\13\
Unlike most tabletop wargames where you have complete control over every soldier’s actions, Battleground puts you in the role of a true general. Your troops are loyal and will obey your orders but you can’t be everywhere so you have to spend your resources carefully!

RATING: 7
This is essentially Warhammer Fantasy Battles without the miniatures and for the most part, it works. The command system is very interesting, with units acting on pre-set (at the beginning of the scenario) standing orders until a command action is taken to change them. Actions are of course limited, so players have a real juggling act to manage in order to keep their army coherent and functional. Exactly as it should be.

Combat resolution is simple, although it took me a while to get used to rolling UNDER target numbers instead of over them (ie. Axis and Allies). There is also a command deck full of gotcha cards, so no attack roll is ever a sure thing. The game also features a rather punishing morale system, so a good bit of your actions are often used just trying to support engaged troops and rally broken units. There are tons of agonizing decisions to make, which is always a good thing in a wargame.

My only real complaint about the game is the measuring system. In an attempt to make Battleground require nothing but a starter deck and a few dice, all measurements are expressed in card lengths. Terrain modifiers reduce speed by movement classes, which are basically half or whole card length penalties. It's not the most elegant system in the world. Personally, I think the game works just as well, if not better, with a good old fashioned ruler. Also, I should note that movement resolution of the automated units can be a bit subjective. My group usually ends up fudging some moves to engage the enemy or avoid terrain, but we aren't ultra competitive with this particular game. It seems to me that a tournament style environment for Battleground would be a nightmare, due to the myriad of judgement calls required. If that sort of environment is where your interest lies, this might not be the game for you.

I resisted this at first because for all outward appearances it was nothing more than a deck of cards with really bad CGI art. "I'd much rather play with minis", I'd say. I'd groan about being a quarter inch out of charge range because I wheeled imperfectly...But then I'd watch while a rampaging T-rex smashed my catapult, then groan as my unit of light skirmishers were obliterated in a crushing flanking move. Retaliating, my Orc marauders would punch through a line of spearmen and begin rampaging through a long bowman unit bringing up the rear.

The next thing you know, I'm jumping around the kitchen screaming "Both hands is for killin' !!!" at the top of my lungs...

Yup. I came around on this one. Good game, for sure.

Boy do I ever love this game in concept.  Unique characters with varying special powers!  Available in non-blind, affordable expansion decks!  A deck of special ability cards personalized to each faction!  I love the orders mechanic, and writing on the card for orders and damage is unquestionably cool.

Unfortunately, combat is just too slow and complicated for my tastes.  I don't have experience with miniatures games, and I'm told the system is actually fairly simple compared to some, but I was unconsciously hoping for something else, I guess.

The rest of the game is cool enough, however, that I'm willing to put in the effort to internalize all of the variables and see if it goes smoother with experience.  If I have the time, I might write a program to automate combat resolution to some degree.  I want to love Battleground, and maybe in time or with some computer support I will.

Own two sets with reinforcements, High Elves and Orcs.  Christmas present from Heidi and Jason.  Thanks guys!

Got some, getting more... Really good, really playable game. Have to do something to protect the cards though. Despite being designed to write on, some decks are much glossier than others, and the duller ones do not erase well! I think card sleeves are in order here...

But despite that, I think this has to be the best miniatures game I've played so far. Except, without miniatures, of course...

Excellent game game though I'm not sure that I'm that much of a miniatures gamer.  I'm hoping to teach this to the players in my group early next year.

UPDATE:  The above didn't happen and I have dropped my rating.  Without players willing to play I can't rate the game as highly.  I think some of the players really didn't like how the Orks were depicted.  They have stuck in their minds "this is what and Ork needs to be I guess.  I personally love the idea behind the Lizardmen and wish I would have had Lizardmen against the Dwarves or something for my first demo.

I'm willing to try again but frankly Summoner Wars might be more my style.

Really enjoy how much great game is crammed into a small deck of cards! Very clever and compelling design to use cards in lieu of figures. Interesting mechanics. Lots to like in the design and rules -- the gameplay easily lives up to my expectations. Lots of tactical options, lots of army-building options and lots of replay. Phenomenal value for your investment.

Really good game. You start with two armies and then you want everything. I hope the game does well so we can have more goodies in the future. The 10 is really justified. I always want to play this game!

Update: I currently own everything that has been produced for this game and will probably continue to buy every new faction and supplement. The "thrill" of discovering the new strategies and army builds for each new faction is really something.

Just got two armies of Orcs and Lizardmen and their expansions, oh and the terrain pack. Thought they provided a decent balance. Not had a chance to play it yet. Started reading through the teeny tiny rule book.

This game plays like WHFB, but appeals more to my gamer nature.  I don't like to play one army over and over.  This game lets me vary my army and play style easily and on the cheap.  The other advantage is that there are no crazy nigh-unkillable characters -- just big blocks of troops.  

There is a very high fun factor in this game.

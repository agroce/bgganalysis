My first and only [person=4][/person] game.  If this is representative of his work, I can see why he was so highly regarded.  This is a great intersection of vocabulary and math to appeal to both sides of the brain.

For those who hate [thing=320][/thing], and trying to unload those Z, Q, and X tiles, this game is the game for you.  If you draw them, you don't have to buy them, and hence, not have to deal with them.

RATING: 5.5
{1 play, 4 players} I must say, I wasn't that impressed.  And yet... I would not only play again, but I suspect *any* of the variants - we just played the basic game - could easily knock my rating up a few points.  Heck, even the basic game might be better the next time now that I understand it a bit more... and we don't all keep rolling frickin' FIVES every turn :)  The gorgeous production really helps, but, as stated by others, you better be semi-serious about word games or it might not be that fun for you.

Similar to Scrabble but faster.  Like Scrabble, the emphasis is on long words.  I don't think that this rewards skill as much Scrabble, but is faster and is  good every now and then.

You buy letters then sell words for profit. It's good to play something diferent once in a while. It should have come with a hourglass or something to speed up the game.

A nice change of pace from Scrabble. Emphasizes long (9-14 letter) words, which is different than Boggle or Scrabble. Fairly inexpensive. Of course, anyone not interested in word games need not apply.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: The component production for this game is very nice, with light wooden tiles and a large cloth bag to draw them from. The game takes approximately 2 minutes to teach, 30 minutes to play, and can be tailored for both young and adults.  I'm not a big fan of word games but this Sid Sackson game combines word creation with light economics giving it a little twist that keeps me interested.Buying letters to sell words for a profit is actually fun and my family is looking forward to playing it again.

I enjoy this word game more than others for reasons that are not entirely clear, but are probably due to the squared payoff you get for creating really nice long words.  In Scrabble you need to consider word length as a tactical option, e.g., you will probably end up using short words and only the occaisonal long words.  In Boggle you only get words four letters long.  In Typo there was an interesting element of using the 6 Nimmt! mechanic in combination with letters, but it never seemed to work out to be as much fun in practice.  I think it's because you can't construct long words all at once and get that satisfaction.

So, BuyWord involves wise investment in the form of making long words because they will save your bacon.  Although you may sometimes want to make shorter words to save up some very useful letters so yu can keep going.  BuyWord can be tight, moneywise, if you aren't careful.

This game feels like a waste of energy. We've played this a handful of times (all 2-player), and the scores have been so close each time that they feel inevitable. I can't tell what constitutes a mistake, or a clever play. Without feedback there's nothing but the satisfaction of making words, and the hand limit of ten tiles sorely restricts the possibilities. There are better word games.

Picked this up for my mom as it's a word game that can easily be played solo.  It fills a great word game niche. The selection of letters, whether to buy or sell, adds a great strategy element to the game.  If you enjoy word games this is a great option. Look forward to more plays.

2/18/15 inceased my rating. Finally got a chance to play this some more with my mom.  It has easily held its appeal. If I gamed with anyone who enjoyed word games, I'd definitely recommend this.

Fun and fast-playing word game, but there's usually not a lot of player interaction. The paper money is a bit cumbersome, and might be better with poker chips due to the large amount of buying and selling. Also, my copy came with several tiles stuck together from the varnish coating (easily popped apart), and was missing the Q tile. I wrote to Face-2-Face about it, and they quickly sent a replacement. Good service!

Scrabble? No. Monopoly? No. Strangely, not that of a draw for me even though it's a word game. Perhaps it's in the randomness of the drawn tiles.

RATING: 3
I got this game because buying and selling letters to make words sounded cool (I like Scrabble; I like economic games). The problem is, someone forgot to mention that this isn't a game - there is zero player interaction, the only real skill is making words, there is no money management involved. Any of the variants might make this a real game, but they seem like obvious off-the-cuff suggestions rather than playtested variants (the "auction" variant, the most promising avenue to turn this into a real game, is the one that is obviously the most non-functional). Knizia never would have foisted off such a half-developed game on us. Maybe it was comparatively more impressive when it was first released, but the 2004 edition needed to be updated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very cool twist on word games, as this one introduces money management into the equation.  Pay manoey to buy some letters, then form a word that hopefully earns you more than you paid for the letters!  The payout is dependent on how many letters are in the word, as well as the difficulty to use those letters (they're "ranked" like in Scrabble).

Probably the best word game I've played.

Really neat "buy the letters at a flat rate, and score words exponentially" mechanism. Sackson was a genius.

I enjoy weighing my options before committing to buy. I like that the game encourages long words and not short words. I love that everyone gets equal access to the safety valve of wilds.

This is likely the best word game this word game hater has ever played.

RATING: 6
Neat little word game. I love the blend of spelling and money management (and even a little playing the odds based on what other tiles you're likely to draw). A good word game for people of differing skill levels, since tiles are open so people who can't spell can easily get help, and because knowing when to sell and when to buy are just as important as making words. I look forward to trying out all the different variants.

RATING: 7
Very basic but excellent game of building words, scrabble-like, anagram-like.  The Sacksonesque twist is that you create the point stakes by the investments you make in the letters. So far it's proved pretty addictive.  My fiancee is *really* good at this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun word game.  I commend GAMES Magazine for going outside the consensus and making this pick.  If you absolutely abhore word games, then this really won't change your mind.  Similarly, if someone in your house is a Scrabble master, prepare to get crushed yet again.  However, this game has a shorter playing time than Scrabble and favors the pure creation of words, rather than some lame two letter word just to capitilize a triple-word score.  Wild cards also add a nice dimension.  Furthermore, it's possible to play solo if you just want to work on flexing your vocabulary.  The variants add more complexity and sometimes more fun to the basic game.  There's a reason Sid Sackson is such a highly regarded game designer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Scrabble with too much math.  This game is heavily depended on the dice rolls and draws.  It's OK.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
With the drafting rule, this game is an utterly fascinating word game that rewards you not only for making large words with many uncommon letters, but also for efficiently collecting those letters.  Sometimes, buying expensive letters to make a word can blast your cash flow when you pick a lot of letters (or a lot of expensive letters), but you can't count on getting anything good with a small draw.  Add that to the restricted letter pool that you're allowed to keep, and you really have to manage your tiles if you want to make something really worth selling.  Knowing fancy words is nice, but making them can be a challenge!  Always leave yourself some options!

RATING: 5
I enjoy BuyWord a lot more than Scrabble. There is more flexibility in your letters...and the timing of when you make your big money words feels much more strategic. I also like the Wild tile mechanism. Some people might complain that the scoring is too mathy...but it seems quite straightforward to me. You're just trying to get lots of pips into high-paying words. This is a pleasant two-player game with my wife. If played with 4 players I think I would consider a timer to keep things flowing. Still, its nice that all 4 players are doing something at the same time rather than one at a time like Scrabble.

One play - nice game.  Really the only frustration I had was having to turn in my tiles and then sitting around with nothing to focus on and waiting and waiting and waiting while other people tried to make their words.  The game really could do with a timer.  Other than that, I love the mechanism of having to 'buy' the letters and try to sell words at a profit.

Like Scrabble but rewards large words.  Unfortunately, each player barely broke even mostly the fault of the excessive number of 5's rolled.  Player interaction was completely absent but the intersection of luck, math and wordplay is compelling.  UPGRADE.  We changed the 5 on the die to a 3 and it made the game much much better.  UPGRADE.

Underrated little word game from Sid Sackson. Definitely worth trying if you like the genre. Features a nifty mathematical system for payouts and has a HELL of a lot less waiting than scrabble. Draft variant is the best way to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players draw 2-5 Scrabble-like tiles from a bag, and have the option to purchase them.  Each letter is rated for rarity and priced accordingly (Z's and Q's are expensive, A's and T's cheap).  As the letter pool increases, players try to form them into words and sell the word back to the bank, again based on the letters involved.  Nice word building game for the Scrabble boffins (i.e. my wife), with some nice money management decisions included.  The base game has no player interaction, but there are several variants in the rulebook (draft, auction, etc) to increase that.  Word game fans should check this out.

Financial word game by Sid Sackson, where you buy letters and sell them for a profit as words.   

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/737111

The base game is somewhat multiplayer solitaire, but the drafting variant comes recommended for a meatier and more interactive game, and is preferred by many (for an alternate view, see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4561834#4561834]here[/url]).

Can also play solitaire.

RATING: 6
Only Sid Sackson could design a word game based on investment.  You buy letters for the square of their value (8 pts of letter = $64).  You sell words at the same rate.  So, you want to buy letters in little bits and combine them to make big words.  It's kind of cool.  This did win a Games Game of the Year award, but it's not THAT good.  It's kind of nifty for a change once in a while.

It is a word game with a bit of a twist.  I'd play it with someone who wanted to play, might even play it solo again.  But there are other games I'd go normally go for first.  In particular I'd gravitate to Paperback especially for a solo or coop word game but also for competitive.

RATING: 7
I've been interested in this game for awhile, being both a word game fan and a Sackson fan. But I never really pulled the trigger as it gets somewhat middling reviews.  Glad I found a thrift copy and was finally able to try it out! BuyWord definitely does something different, but it is pleasant and more thinky than word games usually are (beyond the memory retrieval portion).  The secret is to buy letters cheap but then find yourself in the position to sell large words off at a profit.  This is managed by squaring the value of the tiles bought and squaring the price of the words sold.  As such, the larger the word - the better the payoff, so it's always worth holding off and trying to make the largest word possible (which gets around the inevitable 2-letter word issues with Scrabble).  The strategy becomes quite apparent by the end and you are then relying on your word skills for big payouts.  But it's fun to consider what to buy and when to sell, and there's a bit of push-your-luck in this one which I enjoy.  Overall, this is a very worthy addition to the small coterie of word games I own.

No 2-letter Scrabble puke like "qi" in this. At least if you don't want to go bankrupt. The longer, the better, and combined with money management, this one is a real winner. Sid's a genius.

A great word game, combining elements of Perquacky and Scrabble.  I think this might appeal to the geeks that "don't like word games" as it's a sort of mathematical problem too:  how to buy low and sell high while balancing vowels, consonants, and letter combinations.

Buyword is not so much a "game" as it is a competitive solitaire exercise. In fact, it plays just as well with one as it does with more. There are variants in the rules to increase the player interaction, but I haven't felt the need to try them yet. The drafting variant looks like it would be a good choice who demand a more interactive experience; I hope to try it sometime soon. There's a place in the world for non-interactive games, especially word games, which already tend to lean toward puzzle-like activities. Buyword is a very good anagramming game, and I think the economic system of purchasing letters and selling words is brilliant. Buying the tiles offered to you is usually an automatic "yes" decision (although not in every case), so the purchase decisions are not that interesting. Selling words is a different matter altogether. The way words are valued according the square of the number of pips creates tough dilemmas, especially in conjunction with the hand-size limit. To succeed, it is not enough to be able to make anagrams Players must also understand the timing of the game and consider how to make best use of their limited resources.

This is what happens when Sid Sackson gets his hand on Scrabble. He turns it into an econimic game.

And you really do have to view this as an econimic game first and a word game second. It does reward the use of longer words, which is veyr nice.

Not one of his greatest but a very solid game.

Very replayable, and the simultaneous turns save on sitting around while other people glare at their tiles. Not much to do in terms of strategy but it lends itself to the construction of some fantastic words, instead of the two-letter nonsense that some word games (HELLO SCRABBLE WHY YES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU, HOW'S YOUR OE AND KY THESE DAYS) tend to reward.

RATING: 5
Heh. It's really difficult, with this game, to see whether you are actually making any progress or not. Technically there are two phases here--one where players buy letters and one where they make words from them. But you don't really want to buy letters unless you can make words from them, so in practice separating these phases is a little more difficult. The awareness that people were waiting for this raised my anxiety level; I kind of wanted to play solo and play with combinations of letters as long as I wanted to.  (1 play)

Jul08: Well, I finally have a word game in my collection.  It really seems like a pretty fun one too.  I like how it rewards making long words instead of a bunch of short ones.  It also has some nice money management skills included.

On top of that, it has a wide variety of variants included in the box.  We've tried the "crosswords" variant, but I was saddened by how much my win was influenced by reusing important letters my opponents played.

Overall though, it's an enjoyable game even in the base version.  It's a little lacking in the player interaction department, but that doesn't make it a really bad game.

I don't think it's as good as Boggle or Scrabble like others have said. It is very educational as you have to score squares (and there's a cheat sheet for those still learning their multiplication tables) and make change when you buy letter and sell words.  If you play the "crossword variant" it is less like muti-player solitaire.

A very interesting idea for a game.  I'm not really a big fan of Scrabble, but I'm not anti-word games.  I enjoy Boggle, but I think it's because it's easier for me to see words when the combinations are set.  Having total freedom over a set of letters makes me freeze up (not good in a game like My Word!), unable to visualize the possibilities.  This game is great because it encourages forming longer words.  This is a difficult task that makes me think twice about my own vocabulary.  I like that it's difficult to make money, one must consistently make long words to get ahead.

I haven't tried any of the variants, but I would like to.  This is essentially a solitaire game (which I don't mind at all), but I'm sure there's more player interaction when using the included variants.  "Variant" was actually a word I used in my last game! :)

RATING: 8
The rating system on BGG makes no sense.  That is, the accompanying descriptions of what each number means.  If you follow them accurately, you could never rate a game above "7" if you would ever turn down a chance to play it.  Have you ever met any game that you would NEVER turn down?  Sometimes I'm more in the mood for a lighter game, or a heavier game, or a word game, or a non-word game, or a more familiar game, or a less familiar game, or a game with more or fewer players, or the chance to teach a game, or the chance to learn a new game. Should we really never rank games above a 7 unless we would turn down ALL other opportunities in order to play that game?

So with that said, I do believe it is courteous to follow the BGG ranking descriptions and not make up our own.  Since those descriptions don't make sense to me, usually I just don't rank games I like.  However, BuyWord is a great game and it's not getting enough love, so I'm making an exception here.  Besides, I can't recall actually turning it down, so I'm not breaking the rules,

Draw tiles, buy them (for a price depending on their value) and then make words in the same way - selling them for a value based on the letters. I always wanted to like Scrabble but the best words did not win as it was all about who could get the word in the right place on the board. In this game, the words will score the same and long words give more points. A much more satisfying game.

A clever concept, and possibly a wordgame that people will actually play with me, but a much higher luck element than, say, scrabble.  Pay 256 for 4 letters?  Hmph!

A very good word game with a financial twist. Nicely rewards long words. Twice I've scored 256 points in one play--quite satisfying let me tell you. It's a tough challenge to meet the highest standard (1000 points) in solo play. Comes in a way-too-big box so sturdy that it might just bear the weight of an elephant. [20 plays, mostly solo]

This is a surprisingly addictive game that takes Scrabble and gives it a good hard 'Chinese Burn'.

BuyWord has no board but the players start with some cash and must buy their letters. Letters are drawn from a bag (number determined by the roll of a dice) and they must purchase all or none of the letters.

The key is then to make a word or words that can be sold for a profit. 

This is a must for word game fans out there and still well worth a look for fans of games in general. Adding to the appeal is the play time of 15-30 minutes making BuyWord a slightly more involved filler game.

Solid, crisp "word" game also playable as a solitaire - even though the main driver of the game is building words, profit is the goal and good management vital to win: each round a lot of letters can be bought from the bank by each player, who afterwards has to sell them grouped in words to finish the turn with eight tiles or less plus wilds. The right sense for accepting or rejecting lots of letters, choosing big draws with an almost full reserve to drain the money out of your opponents and of course finding the right words is developed through more and more plays. Very balanced - restricting the letters in hand bypasses the rich get richer issue, and luck may influence a bit, but it keeps the game fresh every time. 

The broad range of suggested variants makes this game even better (check tile drafting!).

There might well be a touch of genius deep behind this game. Buy-sell economy is a common feature, but how many other economical games give you complete freedom in how to put your goods together? Sure, it will bandy a greater audience among the word-game aficionados, but there is much more flexibility here for teaching beginners than in Scrabble, Boggle, Upwords or the rest. A hectic play-time solves many problems that would otherwise be sacrificed to the dullards.

Buyword is good if you are in the mood for a somewhat cerebral, thinky game. It is more akin to Scrabble than to Boggle, for instance, because there is more emphasis on anagramming than on search. I am a little disappointed with the components.

I think this game is better than Scrabble, but then I think that this game is not very comparable to Scrabble:

- Scrabble is less about vocabulary and more about hand management and spatial perception.

- BuyWord is more strictly a word game, where good vocabulary and basic tile-counting is rewarded heavily.

The letter distribution seems a bit weird, though, but I think it's only because I'm comparing it to Scrabble.

I am not always fond of word games, but having said that I am strangely drawn to them. This one passed my notice for a long time, until I finally read a review and it hit me this is a word game I will really love...and I do! I enjoy the mechanic of purchasing the letters before you are allowed to make a word with them. Makng a profit comes from making more money with the words you create then the money you pay for the letters. I would say longer words would definitely be more profitable. You win by having the most money after all the letters run out.

The game can be played in it's simplest form of buying letters, making words and removing them from play. But there are some other nice variants. The Crossword variant allows you to take your created word and place it into a crossword. This variant allows you to make some bigger profit by adding on to previous words and using previously used letters in new words. 

I am interested to try the theme variant, something we really enjoy with bananagrams. All words have to match a chosen theme (i.e. Valentines Day, Christmas, etc.) If we get a chance to play with more players I would also like to try the Auction variant that allows auctioning letters to the highest bidder.

A bit slower than I'd like as you're looking for longer words than Boggle, Scrabble, etc. You score the square of the pips on your tiles - 1 for vowels, 4 for z's, etc) so the way to win is spending the time to find monster long words and manipulating your rack to leave with you tiles to maximise your chances on future turns. This can result in some awful downtime as you pull 10+ tiles this way and that to find your best score, or watch someone else do the same. A decent game for the occasional pull-out but the downtime means it doesn't get out more.

"Clever word game which I would much rather play than Scrabble, and prefer over Bananagrams. Not quite as much fun as Paperback, however."

What I like:
- Simple, quick, fun word game from Sid Sackson
- You buy and sell letters, but must make a profit
- The "choice" option on the die is brilliant
- Rules include a solo option, as well as several other variants

What I don't like:
- It is still a word game, and favors long/obscure words
- The paper money is awkwardly thick(F2F edition)

This game injects the stock-trading concept of "buy low, sell high" to a word game.  Each player is presented with a lot, and the more letters in that lot, the more expensive it will be.  You accumulate letters throughout the game until you want to sell them, which works much the same way: the more letters you sell, the more you'll get for them.  The only catch is, when you sell them, they have to spell words.  I really liked the concept, although the game might be over too quickly for some people.  You could just play for longer, though.

This is a Scrabble-like word game surprisingly by Sid Sackson, the creator of the classic, Acquire. BuyWord is less intense and less prone to analysis/paralysis than Scrabble and in many ways more fun. Some pluses:

- It is much shorter than Scrabble while still retaining a similar flavor,
- Scrabble experts have much less of an advantage,
- You don't have to memorize any uncommon two-letter words,
- You get to buy low and sell high!

In my second playing of the game an amusing moment came up when Georgina, a friend, was able to spell "Acquire" and sell it for $121!!

Has already gone up 1/2 point in just 3 days.  A great game.  When playing with families or non-BGGers, go with the random draw standard rules (but even out the tiles on the final turn).  Otherwise, the draft variant is very good.

Can't quite figure out how the auction variant is supposed to work.  Two out of three players purchase tiles and the other puts theirs up for auction and one of the other players buys it?  That player gets twice as many tiles that turn and the auctioneer gets nothing?  Seems not fully thought out.

Could probably do with a mechanism to deal with unfortunate random events; drawing all expensive tiles on a many-tile draw and cheap tiles on small draws being a significant disadvantage. Unfortunate long pauses when someone has a really good set of letters to try to work out a monster word from.

Interesting twist on word games - I played it once as a two player game with my wife.  There is some danger of excessive downtime if you are in no need of making a word and your opponent HAS to sell a word that turn.  We didn't experience enough to effect my rating, however.  I look forward to trying this again sometime.

(Update 5/09) Played again as a four player affair and with the auction variant - fun game.  Neat twist on the average word game and doesn't take too incredibly long.  Not enough here to garner a seven rating but still fun.

Sell Word, if I can manage it.

Did I mention I'm not a fan of word games?

Gameplay encourages long words instead of gaming small words for word/letter bonuses in Scrabble.  Shorter than Scrabble. It doesn't leave me feeling like killing myself halfway through.

Normally I love word games, but this is one of the type of games where the main skill is making long words from a collection of letters - something I'm terrible at - so I found this less enjoyable than I was expecting.

A game similar to Scrabble. Same letter tiles in a bag. No board though and you first buy words and then sell them for profit. Plays quick and is actually much better than Scrabble.

RATING: 6.5
I have something of a love-hate relationship with word games.  I love the idea of word games.  However, I rarely particularly enjoy the implementation.  The problem is that they seem to reward simply having a large list of words in your head.  I'm not sure that this game overcomes that, but by playing with the tile drafting option, there seemed to be enough going on to distract from this.  The mathy use of the square of numbers is a nice little bonus that appeals to that part of my brain as well.  All in all, I found the game quite pleasant and would very much like to play again.  Unfortunately, I've not yet had that opportunity, nor have I been willing to spring for this as a purchase on its own.  For the time being, I'm still intrigued.  Perhaps my rating will improve with another play.  [02/17/2008]

RATING: 7
[1 play] This is an easy game to learn but successful play is not super intuitive at first. We spent a portion of the first game sort of figuring out how to actually make any money. I think if we play it some more it will be even more interesting.

Fast to play and less intimidating the Scrabble.

Most recent play Nov '13 at Vallie's.

RATING: 6.5
Lacks the spatial aspect of Scrabble and hence loses a lot of strategy opportunities. Also the need to accumulate over several turns before selling means the opportunity for finding gold in the draw is lost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Draw tiles, buy them (for a price depending on their value) and then make words in the same way - selling them for a value based on the letters.  I always wanted to like Scrabble but the best words did not win as it was all about who could get the word in the right place on the board.  In this game, the words will score the same and long words give more points.  A much more satisfying game.

Dear Buyword, even though we just met, I feel like we've known each other a long time.  I guess it's cuz you've got some of your cousin's features, wooden letter tiles, a cloth bag, spelling that make you so familiar, yet different.  I am glad we met and hope we get more chances to hang out in the future.  Have a great summer!

When it comes to word-games, I think BuyWord is perhaps the best one I own.  I like the economic buying-and-selling game, but also the great anagramming (and unlike Scrabble, it doesn't have to fit in a pre-made grid)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After half a dozen plays I'm increasing my rating. Buyword is challenging in a unique way for a word game: sure, you might make a lovely word with that X, but will you be able to recoup your investment in the lot that contains it? The tile-draft option is the only way to go, increasing the interactivity and bringing the luck factor under control. We also round off transactions to the nearest $5, greatly reducing the time spent fiddling with bills.

A fun word game - the scoring mechanism (squaring the cost of words bought/sold) is interesting. You should be able to play the game with LetterHead pieces, but it's always nice to have tiles! Also, the box is amazingly sturdy!

RATING: 7
I mostly prefer this game to Scrabble, if only because at this point in my life I feel that the play experience of Scrabble has been distilled to the spatial and bingo aspects, rather than the joy of being a wordy. Further, there's too much pretense involved with most Scrabble players.

Buyword doesn't suffer nearly as much on the "bingo" front, and the spatial element is uncontrolled by frustrating double and triple word scores (did I mention no bingos?).  It's really just about the words and the cold hard cash.  It's also too new to have been analyzed to the extent of Scrabble, thus it's still got that fresh scent that I like in a word game.  Good job, Sid, you ol' workhorse you!  It's just a pity the box is so damned ugly!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun word game that plays so quickly it can almost be too fast.  I like how there are several different variations on ways to play so you can choose your favorite. The economic aspect is something I don't recall seeing in a word game.  Hope to play again soon!

[F2F 2005 edition] {Economic, word; bidding, word generation; optimal 4p} {5 basic rules, 6 auctions, 5.5 trades, 6 sales, 6 tile draft, 5 crossword} Buyword is a novel word games using money.  It is a very good game for school students. It's especially good for families that like Scrabble. The basic game is dry and static and offers little player interaction. The variants are better: less luck-driven and more player interaction.

Provisional rating based on one game with 4 players. Quite split with the Scrabble player liking it and the rest of us being underwhelmed. Has the same obscure word problem that bedevils Scrabble - how about ween or jumbler? May improve with the variants as has been suggested.

I really didn't like BuyWord as it felt very random and luck based.  If you get hit by more than one bad letter pull you'll lose.  Also the game is very quick, almost too quick.

Finally, a word game that isn't Scrabble and has genuine economic appeal!  BuyWord is the game of building up a letter inventory so that one can sell off highly profitable large words.  The concept is actually intoxicating.  It's more genius from Sid Sackson.

RATING: 6.5
My Scrabble substitute. I love the fact that huge words are rewarded in this game while small words are severely punished. Haven't played the draft or auction variants yet. May do so as tile draws do have an influence on the game. The time it can add to the game length may not be worth it though.

It's an interesting game, but I'm just no good at word games.  I can have a bunch of letter tiles staring up at me, and have no idea what words could be made out of them.  It's better than Sid Sackson's Acquire but not as good as Sid Sackson's Can't Stop.  Although handling all the paper money can be a pain, but it's a nice, pretty simple and straightforward design.

RATING: 5
Nice that it really requires building long words, which helps make it distinctive. The idea of buying and selling is fun, but really in the base game it's just a way of keeping score. The auction or trade variants would seem to make this aspect of the game more fully realized.

Also, minimal player interaction in the base game. When you roll "Choice" you have a chance to put the screws to your foes if you hold fewer not-yet-usable letters than they do, but that's about it. Again, variants should help.

i would really like this game except that i am not good enough in english to succeed in this game. I am planing on making word tiles that match the norwegian language. still another great game by the genious sid sackson
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy the aspect of buying tiles at a low price and selling them back at the highest price possible. I love how the game rewards both making long words and using difficult letters in words. Highly recommended.

Edit: Because I like word games in general, I would be willing to play pretty much any game that rewards anagramming skills, etc. I find that most word games boil down to annagramming, so I consider these to be average word games. BuyWord has a clever economic framework, but it really boils down to annagramming whatever tiles you have bought into the highest scoring word. I prefer a bit more substance in my word games, but I wouldn't decline a game.

A word game that I actually like.  The basic game can be played solitaire.  With 2 to 4, the basic game is still like solitaire.  It is a very flexible game however.  The published variants mix things up in different ways.  One makes it a lot like scrabble where others add drafting, auction or trading elements which add player interaction.  All in all, a good game.

Gorgeous.  I adore this game.  It's a financial word game.  Buy raw materials (letters) on the cheap, and sell finished products (words) for top dollar!  Since every batch of letters - whether words or not - is worth the square of its total pips, this gets interesting and tricky quickly.

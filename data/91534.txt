Might be just me, but I'm not a big fan of this one. I only played it once, so I probably didn't give it enough of a chance.  
It does a fairly good job of boiling catan into a quick, 2-player game.

Looks like a good card game that capitalizes on the the Catan theme, without the un-luckiness of dice and the horrible robber. I think a house rule where you don't steal a random card could make this game a great after dinner game.

Won this in a lotto contest but it seems that it was a real prize after all.

It is one of the games that I always get with me on vacation, a short trip or any place where a game is due to be played.

Have played it with 2,3 and 4 players and its always fun.

Small and compact box you can carry it even in your pocket or your gf's purse :P

The 2 player game is very tight at occasions and the tension really builds up i.e. I got your knight no I got your knight now I got your road etc.

It really doesn't get enough of the attention it deserves.

Also great the fact that it implements some of the catan elements in a simple level.

Must have in any collection that includes short, simple yet entertaining games.

The Struggle for Catan is an ok filler game, or travel game if you like. It plays in about 30 minutes. It have few rules and lacks in depth. As a filler game I am usuallya willing to play this game, but I wouldn't take it out if I am in the mood to play something more challenging.

My rating is based on the 2 player game.

It's Catan, but faster and without the dice to upset me.  It's also more individual than Catan (forced trades instead of negotiation), but there's still a lot you can do to mess with the other players.  I like it.

Setup,explanation, and gameplay for Struggle for catan could be done in under an hour.* Sure it's a light settlers game, but I don't really care much for the go-fish feel of Settlers.  This game has some meat to it, decision-wise. Citadels replaced this game for me as a simple introductory game.

*The rating system for BGG is somewhat wonky to me. For example, I love Arkham horror the most out of my collection. Set-up and play time are pretty long and time needs to be set aside though.

I love it but do not get to play it too much.  Pure card game...nothing but cards, and a pretty accurate condensation of Catan into an easy card game.  Don't play with immature palyers...I made that mistake last time and they do not like the screwage and stealing cards component (which admittedly is a little high).  We feel the University card is a little overpowered and tone it down a bit.  That's the card that let's you substitute one resource per turn for anything you need.  Easy fun quick game with clear rules, when you don't want to take things too seriously.

I have only played a few times. It is a half-decent filler. Not my top pick, but it is enjoyable and gives you the flavour of Catan in a short time.  The stealing a card from opponents isn't enjoyable, and I just ignore it. I prefer the trading aspect like the original board game.

My kids love this game. A couple of the older ones have played Settlers and liked the carry-over into this simple card game. Since I sat down and taught them they have drug this out several times this week to play again.

Personally, I prefer games with a little more complexity and strategic depth, but this seems like a good pick that non-gamers could enjoy.

RATING: 5
Could have been a decent card game but for the overpowered knights. Played 4P and the two players who went for knights spent half the game kicking each other to death. However, knights are so strong that, when one of them came out on top he went straight on to win the game, easily overtaking the two other players who had been quietly amassing points.

The one value about the Struggle for Catan is, it is much faster than the regular boardgame: apart from this, it’s an even worse game than that though, as here you can’t even suggest trades, granted that you still have a road.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. It's noticeably simpler than the original game and the trading between the players is absent, but for someone like yours truly who has played the original game ad nauseam, this is a fast and streamlined alternative. I shan't pretend that it's a deep game, but it's certainly thinkier than it first appears.

With 2 players, "clearly broken" unfortunately summarises the gaming experience adequately in my opinion, so I need to rate that with the abysmal 1:
When both players have recognised the dominant importance of knights (which is not very difficult to see IMO), a long, dragged game with many turns consisting of boringly winning a knight back and forth is very likely. Which is especially unacceptable for a game published as "Das schnelle Kartenspiel" (the quick card game) in German. The city expansion which protects one knight doesn't solve the problem because there is only one of it and it only protects one knight so that there is still an incentive for the other knight to be stolen back and forth.
Quite frankly, I think it is a darned cheek that this humongous and fairly obvious problem passed playtest (was there any?) and the game was published advertising it could be played with 2 players at all.

I haven't actually tried it out with 3 or 4 players after this disaster with 2 players, but I am pretty sure it boils down to this (which is not far away from "clearly broken", either):
If one player gets the knights uncontested, that player wins. If another player contests the knights to prevent him from winning, the two players fighting for the knights are locked in a stalemate and the third player wins (or one of the other two players in a 4 player game). I guess in 3 player games, the two players with the knights could agree on a "knight armistice" at 2 knights each. But the third player can react to that by taking one knight himself and thus likely break the armistice. And in 4 player games, an armistice is even more difficult to set up because of the uneven number of 5 knights and another player that can mess up the armistice.
All in all, I find this only somewhat less broken than with 2 players, I rate it with a 2.

I've combined that to a 1.5 rating on average.

Aunque tampoco es tan malo, simplemente es muy, muy ligero. Mecánicas algo correctas, y da lugar a un pique sano. No tiene dado de producción... algo raro para ser del señor Teuber. Puede que por ese detalle no lo pongo a caer de un burro, a este juego solo le faltaba azar sin sentido para ser carne de hoguera. Así que... simple, pero correcto.

This feels like "Rivals for Catan"-lite, but it's cool that you can play with more than just 2 players. It's not that deep, but it's a fun variation on the theme, and it can get quite competitive since you steal resources/roads/knights directly from the other players. The cards are really flimsy though.

Players are racing to build settlements and cities, and to be the first to 10 victory points.  Speed Catan, using only cards that are picked up, traded then used for building in the good old Settlers combinations.  Every second knight built allows an extra card draw, and every second road allows an extra trade.  The alternate knights and roads are victory points, as are settlements, cities and city upgrades.  Basically a 30 minute dose of "take that" Settlers that feels like it goes on 10 minutes too long.

2-Player mode is broken (start player always wins as long he's not commiting an error). It works though with 3 or 4. Variety of cards is very small. Barely no replay value. Waste of money.

There is no denying that The Struggle for Catan is a much lighter version than traditional Settlers and, indeed, most of the games in the series.  The game plays quickly, with most player turns taking just seconds to complete.  Often, there aren’t many, if any viable options on a player’s turn, which makes for a quick, albeit frustrating turn.  It is also frustrating to have one’s hard-earned roads and knights quickly stolen by opponents, which, as mentioned, occurs frequently.  There is a modicum of protection afforded by the castle and church city improvements, but these only protect three roads and one knight, respectively.  Possessing numerous roads and knights are critical for trading and resource flexibility, and to see them vanish quickly and repeatedly is, well, frustrating.

I am also not fond of the trading aspect of the game.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of Settlers of Catan is the trading element.  While I may suffer from some unfavorable resource rolls, I always have the ability to acquire needed resources via enticing and clever trading with my opponents.  That ability is missing here, as trading is much more haphazard and luck-based.  It really should be called "swapping."   Yes, the absence of player-to-player trading does help the game move at a quicker pace, but at the expense of much of the excitement, challenge and fun.  This is not a good trade.

While The Struggle of Catan maintains the atmosphere of its forefather and plays quickly, it lacks the excitement, challenge and cleverness of the original.  It is far more luck based and much of one’s accomplishments can be quickly stolen by opponents.  In my opinion, this is not a worthy addition to the Settlers franchise.

On my first play, this game revealed a severe design error: A situation in which I could no longer win, but my opponent hadn't yet won. So the only thing I could have done was to postpone her victory (for quite a while, actually). I resigned - but this kind of situation should have been caught during playtesting. I expected more from Teuber here. That said, we played again and had a good bit of fun - the game is quick to learn and quick to play. I would play again.

The Struggle for Catan is really easy to teach (especially for veterans of The Settlers of Catan), plays quickly, and is well-balanced.

But it is over TOO quickly. There's not enough time to really build-up a strategy. Gameplay simply devolves into acquiring City Expansions (the card worth the most points) as fast as possible. The main way that you can derail other players (trading with their hands) becomes less beneficial than pulling a guaranteed needed resource from the Market.

I actually think the speed and limited complexity might make it better suited as a game for children. As is, though, I find it over before it becomes any significant fun.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (September 2015)

In general, my desire to play Catan games is low. That is not to say the games are bad, but I prefer to try other games. I finally played The Struggle for Catan and it was better than expected.

There is no dice in the game, so the luck factor is diminished a bit at least (it still has a healthy dose of randomness, but if it flows quickly I don’t mind much). It also plays very fast, I really like this feature. The decisions are mostly obvious and the rules are very easy to explain, so it is perfect for nongamers. I would have loved the game before I became an addict to boardgames.

I prefer it as a two player game. There is no negotiation in the game. Perhaps it has too few cards so I believe the replayability factor can be rather low.

Bottom line, I don’t think I will ever buy it, but I won’t say no to a play of this if requested. It is a good family game. I like it better than its parent game Settlers of Catan.

Sólo lo he jugado una vez y es suficiente.

Jugamos a la version de 2 jugadores y la partida iba bien. Ya durante la partida nos dimos cuenta de que había una interacción un poco forzada en la manera en la que se ganan los caballeros y las calles, ya que una vez que se acaban sus respectivos mazos, la única manera de obtener una nueva carta es robándola de la ciudad de tu oponente. Pero cuando estábamos llegando al final de la partida esta acción se empezó a repetir más y más, y lo único que se podia hacer era robar una de estos dos tipos de cartas para evitar/retrasar la victoria del rival.

Si te gastas todos los recursos ronda tras ronda en comprar un caballero o una calle, no te los estás quedando para intentar comprar una mejora para tus pueblos/ciudades, por lo que estás repitiendo lo mismo una y otra vez simplemente esperando un error de tu rival (en realidad no es un error sino simplemente que él/ella no sea capaz de conseguir todos los recursos para quitarte un caballero o una calle).

Las últimas rondas nos parecieron un rollo y por esto decidí no volver a jugarlo nunca más. Puede que con 3 o 4 jugadores la cosa cambie (no lo creo), pero es que ni lo voy a intentar.

[color=blue]
I just played it once was it was enough.

We played the 2-player variant and the game was doing quite ok. During the game we noticed a forced interaction in the way the knights and the streets are obtained, because once their respective decks are depleted, the only way get a new card is by taking it from your opponent's city. But when the game was coming to an end this action became more and more usual and the only thing we could do was stealing one of these two types of cards to avoid/delay the opponent's victory.

If you spend your resources round after round buying a knight or a street, you are not keeping them to try to buy an upgrade for your towns/cities, so you are repeating the same procedure over and over again just waiting for a mistake of your opponent (not really a mistake but just him/her not being able to get all the resources to take a knight of a street from you).

We found the last rounds really boring and I decided not to play it anymore. Maybe with 3 or 4 players it is a completely different game (I don't think so) but I'm not going even to try.[/color]

RATING: 4.5
A very good adaption of Catan into a card game format.  It's just not that special.

Also, it doesn't have the most intuitive rules or provide the most fun I've had in a basic card game, but it works.  The A/B side of the cards can be difficult for non-gamers to understand.  If, however, you appreciate Catan as a "world" and want a portable, quicker version of all that, Struggle for Catan is where its at.

  Just know that nothing about this game says, "play me!"  In fact, if you have the option, why not just play Catan?  I can;t think of a reason why I would dare to pull this out instead.

Un jeu que je n'ai découvert que 3 ans après sa parution. On est dans le plus pur esprit Catane dans la thématique. Il est moins agressif et stratégique que le très bon jeu à 2, moins chaotique et plus tactique que le jeu de plateau. Se jouant de 2 à 4 (et même jusqu'à 6 avec 2 jeux), il est finalement le jeu idéal pour ceux qui n'ont aucun jeu de la série Catane chez eux. Pour le prix, c'est un excellent investissement.

There's a little bit of interesting game in there, that is achieved through a generally annoying and repetitive process of "trading" which is really stealing a card from others...  but I am not compelled to play it a second time, and gave my copy away at the end of the first play.

Simpler version of Catan card game.  I like some of the simplifications such as drawing resource cards instead of rolling dice for them. I also like the fact that there's a 'marketplace' of 5 face-up cards you can buy instead of randomly drawing from a face-down stack.  I think some of these simplification ideas could be successfully grafted onto the older Catan card game.

Interesting little card game translation of Catan. The best thing about it is that it ends pretty quickly, and the second-best thing is that you don't roll any dice. Also, there's no arguing and sheep. Doesn't play very well with two, but three or four is somewhat interesting. The University is clearly the best card though.

12/07/11 Received. 
07/05/14 Played a four-player game in 48 minutes. 
As a big Settlers of Catan fan I really looked forward to buying this game. There are many similarities to the board game but it is a bit quicker, and somewhat easier to teach. I like the nastiness of being able to steal roads and knights from other players. The card artwork is nice. On the negative side, the rules could have been a *lot* better. Items you'd think ought to be in the same section aren't. Some things aren't in the rules at all, like: a graphic of the Market Day card and what it does, and how many of each type of city expansion there are. Overall the rule book gives the impression it was hastily or lazily slapped together to get the product out, in order to milk the Settlers cash cow one more time for a quick buck. The rule book is so lacking that if I didn't have the flowchart like graphic posted here at BGG delineating the turn overview, the game would be much more difficult to teach and play.   
01/13/15 Played a four player game in 48 minutes. The last 15 minutes really drug as 2-3 players hovered at 9 points due to constant road/knight thievery. So it seemed to take forever before one player could rise to 10 points. That was a buzz kill for everyone. Therefore I'm lowering my rating from a "7" to a "6". For I now feel this is a flawed (or insufficiently developed) design. Oh, I'll still play it, but not very often.  
12/15/15 Game #3, three-player, 52 minutes. 
06/07/16 Game #4, four-player, 46 minutes.
01/30/18 Game #5, three-player, only time for half a game.

La próxima partida probaré a jugar sin permitir ese tipo de comercio.

Well it really is a Struggle.At least the awful trade mechanic of the series is a bit different, but after repeated plays I can`t envision our group taking to this at all.

Update. After another gaming group session..without doubt they used the right term..the game is slow..ponderous..and is far too long for what it is. Then there`s the problems with the city expansions. The game for me just seemed a couple hours of wasted time..and a victory for anyone just feels hollow in the end. Wanted to like..but eh...this is Catan...what was I thinking?

It plays a little cut throat and long for us. Especially with two players. It's a constant battle for roads and knights until finally someone captures all of the roads and knights, and then you box someone in a corner and they can't get out. No one ever even really tries to do anything else because if you don't have at least one road or knight you're WAYYYY behind.
 
While I like the game "ok", it's probably not one that will be played that often. Bought it for $5 so I'm not complaining too much.

Instead of rolling for resources, you just draw them. Build roads to be able to trade cards in the hand for cards in the draft that you want (rather than the default get a blind card), build knights to be able to draw more cards, build settlements to then convert into cities, which can then be converted into 3VPs via a new expansion build, and this'll get you a special power as well. Every second road and knight is a VP. First to 10 VPs wins. Roads and knights run out quickly, which then gets into tit-for-tat stealing off each other, which ain't too much fun and slows the game down, but it seems a necessary evil as you can't let other players get dominant card drawing power. It's semi-random and a bit of a slow haul to get to the win. Nothing innovative or exciting about it unfortunately.

Based on one play: Using your resources you build roads, knights and settlements in your play area. And then upgrade settlements to cities and then to city upgrades. All this gives you points and allows you to draw and trade more cards. However, there is a shortage of roads and knights, so those must be stolen form other players once the supply runs out. Definitely has a lot of similarities to Catan, simple and fun.

Catan is an old classing, and the card game makes it a lot funier. Original game is good, however, not knowing what you opponents have, what they will build, and the new building makes the game more difficult. Also, splitting the game in eras was a great idea.

I liked it more than expected! I am no longer fond of negotiation/trading games like original Settlers of Catan, and this clever card game does away with that aspect of Catan while still preserving the rest of the feel of Catan (roads, villages, cities, 5 resources, interchanging resources on the game's market, etc).

This is a simple game and is a nice, portable version of Catan. I like that it allows for a two player version and really is set up to work for the 2-4 players it says nicely.  The rules are really simple, play is quick.  I like the two player Rivals version as well, but this is definitely easier and faster (and requires less space to play!).  The ability to "steal" roads/knights is a neat feature as well.  (JW)

- Very addictive game even for "not tabletop fans".
- Very good (and cheap) "intro" game to "transfer not tabletop fans" to more complex (and 5x better) tabletop game Settlers of Catan.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- After about 20 games you get the idea of all mechanics and there is almost nothing to surprise you.
- Luck (in getting good cards) is more important than the player's skill.

I love this simple little card game to add to my catan collection.

I am in grad school and in my class we have a group of 8 or so people who like catan that we can get 4-6 at a time to meet up weekly to play the board game.

I keep this on me in my backpack so if we have a 2 or 3 hour break between classes I can pull it out and a few of us kill time while waiting.  

It's a very enjoyable 2 player game (plays faster and more direct than the 3 or 4 player gameplay).  My girlfriend and I played the game 19 times in 2 days because we couldn't stop trying to beat each other (score stands with her 10 wins me 9...she won't play anymore).

1 play, 2er

Yes, it fits in the Catan universe -- same resources, same things to build (plus the city expansion for ore and 3 sheep). But game play is completely different -- it's simply a card game. Unfortunately, it's not different in a good way! This is a random, take-that take on Catan, with relatively few decisions to make. You hope you draw well, get the resources you need to build something, and wait for the game to end. The limited supply of roads/knights, the ability to steal them from other players, and the need to protect yourself from stealing by building a specific city expansion (only one available to protect 3 roads, another for 1 knight) is annoying if you're not lucky enough to be first to build these things! 

We just didn't enjoy our play very much. I would, however, try it again -- but only with 3 or 4, in hopes that it's better. But I doubt it would every be very highly rated!

--- Summary ---
The deck of resource cards is shuffled, then deal each player a hand of 3 cards and 5 face up to the table (the MARKET). Also place stacks of cards in the center: roads, settlements, knights, and city expansions. Each player starts with one road and settlement (side A up) in front of them.

On your turn, Trade, the Build, then Draw.
Trade: with another player (draw a random card from their hand, then return one to them), the bank (discard a card and draw from deck), or with the market (exchange a card). May trade once for every Road you have, with side A up.
Build: spend resource cards. Roads and Knights are built in an overlapping stack, alternating A- and B- sides (B sides are worth 1 VP; Road-A allows trade; Knight-A gives extra card draw at end of turn). If no Road/Knight left in center, take from another player (closest player according to Destiny Card direction). If building Settlement, may flip Destiny Card. For city, flip your settlement and do the event (either Brigand Attacks -- discard down to 7 resources -- or something else).
Draw: draw 2 cards, plus 1/Knight-A, from draw deck.

First player to 10 VP wins!

RATING: 5
This card version of catan sadly looses the trading between players for a more random exchange of resources (to "trade" with a player you take a random resource and then give him back whatever you want). You can also tradevwith an open market (taking a resource and giving one back).

The game feels quite random, but there are some interesting decisions - what to take/return to the market, since that is one way to deny resources to others; which buildings to prioritise; and similar to trading with the market the random exchange with other players can again delay them for a turn or two -> so the main think you have to pay attention to is to what other people need and what they have enough of, so you can at least try to deny resources.

Latest installment in the never-ending story of Catan. A card-drafting game that's a race to 10 points by building roads (to exchange more cards or 1VP), knights (to draw more cards or 1VP), settlements, cities & city expansions for 1/2/3/4 VP. A bit of take-that in the form of exchanging cards with other players and stealing their roads & knights. For what it is - I found it rather enjoyable.

It's a shame Mayfair ditched the small box of the German edition and went with an oversized box and a crappy insert. Decent UK price though.

A fast quality card game with minimum depth and a clear dominant strategy. 

I only lost in this game once, the first time. And since noone has even come close to beating ""my"" strategy (with a different one), I consider this game broken. And easily broken, that is.

Rating after one play with two. Simple and luck-driven cardgame that offers no real tension - not even for non-gamers in my opinion. While playing, I felt like I was hardly making any meaningful decisions. Still, the artwork is great and the game is nicely portable (even though the cardstock is pretty bad). I am willing to give it another chance, but only with more players and probably some kids (it sure is simple enough).

The Struggle for Catan does a very good job of distilling the Settlers of Catan boardgame down into a quick thirty minute card game. Trading between players has been removed, which will certainly be a turn-off for some people, but there still is a trading aspect to the game, as players all interact with a common pool of market cards. As a result, there is still a sense of gathering resources and trading them out for different, more useful ones.

Aside from the trading, the rest of the game plays very much like you would expect. Players trade their goods to build roads, villages, knights and cities until someone hits the VP goal. As far as Settlers of Catan card games go, it's not nearly as ambitious as Rivals for Catan, but the learning curve is much shorter here and it actually does a better job of capturing the essence of the original game.

I enjoyed my initial 4p game but it ran significantly longer than advertised and this was a downer considering the lightness of it. I would be happy to play again and my rating may change - it does retain some of the feel of the board game while ostensibly being half the length (although this needs to be tested).

I like this game far more than the original Settlers of Catan. There is more interaction in the game, the game goes faster and you're not waiting for your turn for hours. Moreover, you're not dependent on the chance of the dice, nor on your start positions. Also, this game has play mechanisms that give some advantages to players with fewer victory points. This keeps the game suspenseful till the end!

It's okay... but definitely not more than that. It has more interaction than the Catan Card Game, which is for me a good thing. The constant stealing of roads and knights makes this game dynamic and keeps it interesting. But there's just not very much you can do. Trade a little, build a little, draw 2 cards... It's not meaty enough to stay interesting. But at least it's short, games mostly take 15 minutes.

The Settlers of Catan can be seen as a milestone in modern boardgames. It was published in 1995 and nowadays it’s still fun to play a game of Catan. The biggest disadvantage of the game, that it’s a 3-4 player game. Since it was published there were expansions to play it with 5 or 6 players, but never there was an expansion to make it playable with two players. For two players there was a cardgame published in 1996. For me, the cardgame misses ‘something’. It’s a nice game, but that’s it. 16 years after Catan was published and tons of variants and expansions later, The Struggle for Catan was published. The subtitle of the game is: The fast cardgame. This subtitle made it possible that it didn’t appeal anything at all to us. But then we were able to buy a brand-new sealed copy for just EUR1,- Well, we couldn’t refuse such an offer.

Each player starts with 1 village, 1 street and 3 resources. Each turn he has the three following actions:

    For each street with the A-side up, he can trade one resource card with the market or with an other player (blind trade).
    He can build a street, village, city or city-expansion by paying the costs for it with resource cards.
    He takes two new resource cards. If he has a knight with the A-side face up, he takes one extra resource card.

While playing, I was hoping the subtitle of the game became truth. It’s just repeating each turn over and over again, until there’s the moment that one scores 10 victory points. This game is fast, but for me it’s not fast enough.

RATING: 6
A typically Colovini abstract design.  It may take several plays to recognize how to plan and execute strategies in this influence game.  Player moves are rarely final, so play must be planned several turns in advance and in several areas of the board.  Graphically, not a pretty game, but it is easy to play and offers some depth.

This isn't a bad game but just one I don't play often because others aren't interested. As people try to control the islands and Merdians they must plan for what sized pieces are adequate to gain control.

After one year unplayed, Meridian finally get on the table. 

Probably another underrated Colovini game. If this game were signed by Knizia maybe it would be one hundrets positions better in the BGG rank.

My first impression was good although it's a dry abstract strategy game hidden behind the card game appearance. I think there is more than meets the eye.

I want to play this more to learn how to make good and worth moves.

Okay abstract - theme is so paper thin as to be non-existant. I think I'd like it 2 player, but with more than that and control goes out the window. Seems the end game is all important, and that's pretty much outside your control as it depends on the order your deck is randomly shuffled into. Might be a game you could analyse and then reach a deeper understanding, but I think the lack of control makes that unlikely, and I really wasn't taken enough to want to try. I won, but I'm not convinced it was through any particular skill, I played my moves fast and didn't think to much, just optimised what I had, and the end game (last 4 cards or so) thought a little more.

RATING: 6
Simple rules and starkly difficult choices make this game a gem.  As the options and resources dwindle, the game gets more and more cutthroat and devious - excellent stuff!  The different height towers can be unintuitive, however - it is all too easy to think that they denote a garrison's strength, rather than its latitude.

RATING: 7
This is a tricky abstract game even though the rules are very simple.  It's difficult to see where to play your pawns early in the game, as they can easily be displaced later.  We play with 2 players, which allows you to place 2 pawns in the same vertical strip.  There are 4 colors in the game, and they are hard to tell apart (2 of them are similar, and the other 2 are similar.)  This works out well for 2 players, because each gets 2 colors, but it could be annoying with more players.  It's also important to keep track of which pawns are sitting on a capitol city, because once a capitol is covered up, it's very hard to tell.

RATING: 5
This one didn't exactly scream out "Hey, Cool Game!" in the presentation department, but it is actually a pretty solid game.  Played the two player version, and would certainly like to try again.  This is an abstract game with more going on in it than appears at first glance.  Plays quickly.

RATING: 2
A game that I would characterise as epically bad. An area influence filler, ok, nice idea to start with, but the number of choices to make are few, and the game ended up annoying me in about every way humanly possible. Firstly, restrictions: you have 20 pieces, in each column you can only play 1 stack (from 1 to however many you're willing to spend, generally top out at 5). On top of that, each column must follow a strict ordering system from top to bottom being most to least pieces per stack. While this is impossible to fully explain with the brevity that this game deserves, this essentially limits your placement options significantly and makes some columns worthless to each player. Secondly, you don't actually get much of a choice on where you're going to play. Each player has a deck of cards with numbers between 1 and 10, as well as three wilds with designated trifectas (and one quad) shown. Each turn you have two of them face up, and you must select one and either place pieces there, or discard it, never to be seen again. Essentially this makes the order in which your cards come up very significant, which again, annoys me. Finally, the grip of the theme to the game is beyond the tenuous lows of most Euros and is downright non-existent. I really don't care about theme much on Euros, because I consider it to be a paste job in almost all cases, but when you add it onto the other issues it results in me giving this game the lowest rating possible for a game that isn't flat out burning material.

Meridian looks very appealing, and clearly shows Colovini's hallmark: present very simple rules, and then let the players figure and subsequently battle it out amongst themselves. They attempt to gain majority control of islands which have been 'intersected' by  'meridians'—after which the game of course takes its name. The idea is that a player selects a card open in front of him showing a section number (between 1 and 10, but also in combinations), and then places a tower (usually comprised of several playing pieces) on an island in that section. You are restricted by height rules which state that a taller tower may never be positioned nearer to the bottom edge of the board than a smaller tower; and you may shift towers up or downward to different isles provided there is room for this to happen and the height requirements are not broken. After a fixed number of rounds the majorities on the full islands (most often spanning several sections) are determined and the winner calculated.

The rules are indeed very simple, but in practice the game doesn't work as well as one would hope. The height rules relentlessly clamp down on shifting, and there are many occasions when the two cards you can chose from do not allow you to do something worthwhile, not even recalling useless towers because the majority on an island can no longer be challenged. In all games I've played, the game was over at about three-quarters through the draw decks: further play would at best do nothing to further your position. It just doesn't work as well as you would hope. 

The game would probably improve by removing the cards and just allowing players to play whereever they'd like for a fixed number of rounds (between 10 and 15). Then the senseless card limitations would disappear, and you'd no longer be safe anywhere, although there is still the problem of height rules to contend with. But there are so many better games out there that I have little incentive to start reworking the rules.

[b]Update[/b] Played anew... Nope, still too syrupy from about 2/3rd onwards. Perhaps I approach the game in a wrong fashion? After all, claiming a middle island is folly in the beginning of the game because you are sure to be shifted out. Play would then start by creating a bottom 'stronghold' or 'scaffold' on which you can attempt to jump upwards. But how that leads to an exciting match still eludes me. Rate remains unchanged.

RATING: 6
Production: The garrisons stack easily, and have discernible heights, but are unattractive.  The board is pretty, very much like an old map.  Play: It will take me more playings to formulate a strategy.  It seems advantageous to play a shorter stack whenever possible, as this concentrates one's garrisons on the southern islands, and while expending fewer pieces.  Some turns seemed to afford no choices, and players passed.  Others offered simple yet entertaining decisions.  (2+1+3) (1 play)

I like Colovini's games in general.  They are compact and balanced, without the obvious math bias of other more famous designers.  Meridian is straightforward as it dresses a different layer over an area control game with an ingenious column (meridian) limitation.  There is limited information available to the players to improve the efficiency of the choices each turn.

I enjoyed my first game and I would play again.  However, I'm not sure I will do so very often as area control game is a genre ripe with classics which stand head, shoulders and belly-button above this one.

By no means is this game extraordinary in any way.  In fact, even with all the pieces on the board it's kind of drab and unexciting to look at.  Typical of a dry Colovini game with a thin theme, it still commands subtle strategies and offer opportunities to 'screw the other guy.'  Always a plus.  
It's also short enough to be a good filler.  Even with four players a game will certainly end in 30 minutes or so.  
It will most likely never enter my top ten, but it's a decent game.

A bit odd in the intersection of columns and islands.  I look forward to trying it again.  It seems a little frustrating when it gets to be late in the game and none of the moves you can make are productive.  It's also a bit prone to analysis paralysis.

The playing board is separated into 10 columns, or "meridians". A number of islands are on the board. Each player has a deck of cards numbered 1 to 10, plus three other cards with mulitple numbers. The cards govern where one can play stackable towers. Towers must be placed so that they are increasing in height from top to bottom on the meridian, and towers can be pushed up or down. Players score points for having the most on an island, and the capitol city on island counts two for majority purposes. It's not a bad try at an area control game.  I don't think the moves on a player's turn are too hard to determine, and depending on how your cards show up, it affects how you play. Some chaos, some tactics, and like any other area control game, depends on perception, so your towers could get pushed up or down.

RATING: 5
It's only an occasional game. You have thirteen turns, and you're limited each turn to 2 of the 10 meridians (columns) you can build in. Inside each meridian, each tower must be a different size. Because you only have 20 tower pieces to spread across 10 meridians, and in a 4 player game, towers in each meridian will get to be 4 towers high, the usual strategy is to build as many 1 and 2 high towers as you can, giving you freedom in the end-game to build how you must in order to maximise your points (ie after all the tower shifting is done). Small towers are also less prone to shifting through the game. The downside to this strategy is that the big points are won on the islands won by the 3 and 4 high towers. The rules are quick, the game play is quick (30 mins) as the decision tree isn't that large, and there's a fair bit of luck in how the cards come out.

A more old-fashioned abstract game, it has the advantage of being very easy to teach, quick to play, and require some heavy thinking. I like the nautical map style of the board, it's pretty, and the stacked plastic towers create a visually interesting gameboard. The only problem I had was that by the last third of the game, as you've run out of garrisons to place, I found people constant passing because the had already made their best move. Too often did we find ourselves with only one possible to make, it seemed like the game played itself by the end. But it's still an interesting abstract, and worth checking out.

Interesting game requiring some thought but with a significant (healthy?) dose of randomness due to the cards drawn. Everyone seems to have fun although who's actually leading seems to sometimes get overlooked.

A nice filler.  I do recommend that you play a couple of times, as there is some depth that is not apparent from initial impressions.  It is easy and fast to play.  The concept that you can only play in certain meridians, but that those impact multiple islands (areas) makes for some interesting decisions.  The lack of control over what meridians you can play on (as you can only play the cards you're dealt) does hinder the game from being amazing.

Despite my "4" rating, Meridian has some interesting features and is a rather clean design, affording players room for clever play at times. Of course, on many turns players also can be so constrained either by the number of pieces they have left to place, the (choice of two) areas they are restricted to playing in or the placement of pieces that already have been played that they able to do nothing but pass. For my tastes, Meridian is a bit too abstract, dull and limiting to rate hightly, but fans of abstracts where one or two cricical placements at the right time can swing the outcome will likely enjoy this.

Very abstract, dry, clever and fast: a Colovini typical! Probably too much luck, but I think it's underrated.

Simple, but kinda fun abstract. Theme could be Pylons on a highway, or Knights on flying Ostriches, or let's say, a Plumber dodging Koopas?

An abstract game about conquering the New World by acquiring lands and the cities within them using placed pieces to build up influence in areas whilst trying to avoid losing it in the course of the game. An abstract mechanic to represent the ebb and flow of power but not too bad as not a fan of themes being tacked onto mechanics.

Colvini; After years of negotiations, Queen Wu Wei has at last decided to let some of the powerful European commercial companies establish garrisoned trading posts in the rich cities of the Southern Archipelago, but only on condition that they submit to certain curious rules she has devised. In the game the players personify these companies and compete with each other in setting up garrisons (marked by towers of various heights) in the most desirable locations of the archipelago, while at the same time observing the wily Queen’s rules. Your aim is to take over islands by establishing more garrison in their cities than your opponents. But watch out! During play garrisons may be forcibly displaced!

Dry and abstract area influence game. Each player plays the same set of 13 cards.

Clever idea, but a bit awkward in its play. I like the plastic towers and the way you can stack them, then move the other player around, but it seems to be missing something. A way to completly remove towers of the opponent would have been nice, but it is not in the rules.  Despite that, the game has some decent play in it, and is more fun with at least 3 savvy players.

As said everywhere: Quite abstract and only for occasions. But then, it's tense and interesting.

This is an unusual game. Area majority on islands (east/west) but you can only play in each Meridian once. Very neat.

Another one of Colovini weird games. It's not bad, but there's a lot more games I'd rather play.

Quick two player cube drafting game.  Players build a (small) economy and race to reach a VP threshold before the other player does.  Some cute mechanics that offer some a few interesting decisions in a 30-minute playtime.  The theme is a bit disconnected: it's primarily a game about drafting cubes to make the right set (or deny your opponent the ability to do the same).  The special power buildings make for some tough decisions re: the long term utility of a special ability vs points.

Initial Impressions: 
----------------------
This is a perfect example of a game where it all works, but just isn't very much fun to play.  There are some choices, but I never found any of them very interesting.  The game also does seem to have a bit of a runaway leader problem, but this is tough to tell after just 1 play.  The game also does not offer enough replayability, as the only thing that will change is the order in which the cubes come out, so I've really seen enough after just 1 play.  Not for me, but I could see others enjoying this one.

This is cube-pushing par excellence.  Many here who dislike the game cite this, as if they expect a 30 min game about fast food restaurants to come with a pound of ground beef!  Well, it is not to be.  For those of us who enjoy cube pushing, this is about as purely refined as it gets.  Primarily this is a race game.  The tension is there, at least with experienced players; nailing the right combo and closing out the game with 3 VPs in your last turn is a sweet, sweet feeling.  A definite sleeper, a gamer's game that seems to have escaped much notice.  Recommended.

RATING: 6
A harmless little two player game of developing your pizza/burger joint.  Players can invest in advertising and restaurant buildings in order to expand their business and win the game.

At it's heart, the game is mostly about cube drafting.  You want to claim cubes that will allow you to expand your business, while denying your opponent the cubes that they need.  Developing certain areas of your business will let you call dibs on some cubes or give you special abilities that allow you to gain more cubes and swap cubes around.  You then use those cubes to further develop your business.

Overall, it's fairly quick and was sorta fun.  I'd like to play more to see how many different paths to victory there are, as it seems like there could be a few!

There is something about these small square box Rio Grande 2-player games that really appeals to me, and Burger Joint for sure did not disappoint. It uses the typical Euro game resource allocation (cube pusher) mechanic, but it does so with fairly simple, straight-forward directions and plays in about 30 minutes. Don't let the simplicity fool you. There are still a lot of choices and multiple paths to victory. It makes for a tight game when the players are fairly equally matched. The component quality is nice, and the artwork is charming. The diners remind me of Mel's Diner, one of my favorite places to eat in Pigeon Forge, TN. I think Burger Joint will get plenty of table time at our house.

Hmm...after one play, I'm not sure about this. Was OK, but I'm not overly excited about it. Turning some cubes into other cubes but really streamlined, even dumbed down. the redeeming feature is it being a 2p dedicated game, which is nice to have for the option when you only have that many, but really, I can't see it getting many more plays. Probably one to get my money's worth out of then trade or sell, or even give away. Wasn't bad, just didn't grab me that much.

The resources are not very thematic, they are just coloured cubes with no real meaning. The process of choosing resource cubes during the production phase is kind of fiddly and is a chore, even though it contributes to your strategy. Overall this game could have been more fun, but the game play just isn't exciting the way it is. Maybe some people will dig it.

This game, which involved taking cubes from a bag and adding them to a shared resource area, and then moving them to your own resource area, in order to expand your area and have the ability to get more cubes, did work fairly smoothly, but it was also rather boring, themeless, and dry. Traded away.

Simple two-player empire building game.  Every game I've played has been pretty close.

The theme is a bit tacked on, but that doesn't bother me.  The meat of the game, in my opinion, is which "deluxe" bistros you should build -- there are tradeoffs there in victory points versus in-game powers.

Good little 2-player cube-management game that seems to have a few routes to victory.  Most games will probably be quite close, and every point matters.  It's just the right length (30-45 minutes) for a game that sits where it does on the heavy/light scale.

Neat little game of business expansion.  Food Chain Magnate Lite!  Fine, not at all, really, but it does have a bit of that same fun of growing a business.  I like the theme, but honestly it's veneer: the cubes don't really represent anything and the upgrade abilities have no meaning; but I like the art and for some reason it works for me.  There are only four cube combinations for making purchases, so the cube draw can force your decisions sometimes, but there are often a couple viable options.  The biggest decisions revolve around which bistro you want, balancing between points and special abilities that will help gain more points later.  My only criticism is that it seems like getting that first new diner is essential, since it gets you another cube income per turn, but being first to get it does not guarantee a win.  I can understand why many might not like it, but I rather enjoy it.  It's easy to teach and learn and smooth to play.  It has become an instant hit to play with my mother, and I expect the kids will pick it up soon.

I'm very tolerant of games with weak themes, but this one confounded even me.  Ostensibly with an amusing theme about creating a fast food chain - you draw colored cubes from a bag and then assemble them in sets.  Snooze.  I can't think of a time when the mechanics seemed to so actively flaunt its disconnection from the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I find myself echoing a lot of the other comments I've seen thus far.  The game's theme is surely ridiculously pasted on and completely arbitrary, though I have to admire the fact that a more unusual theme was chosen (similar to the same author's Scream Machine) rather than some ho-hum theme about building or influence in old Europe.  I also like the artwork, which is perfectly satisfactory and whimsical enough to be pleasant to look at, especially inside the box bottom, which is a nice touch.

That said, it's too bad that the central mechanism is kind of boring and just doesn't hook you as much as I'd like.  I don't have a big problem with the luck of the draw (which is substantial, though not worrisome), but just going back and forth "drafting" (why do they call it "drafting"?  why not just say "choosing"?) cubes seems kind of dull.

I have the feeling that we're not playing this game to its potential.  Obviously the upscale bistros are supposed to be important but they are so expensive to build that it seems like it's not always worth the effort.  

The other thing I don't like is how the game is so tight all the way through.  It seems like one player gets a point or two, then the other player catches up.  Then it just repeats until both players are sitting at 10 or 11 points and one happens to get across the finish line.  Not that I like runaway leaders in games, but the engine doesn't seem like it can be manipulated enough to have the game turn out any other way.  But I'm definitely saying that without justification, as I have only played once.  But I fear that I won't be able to get in the number of plays required to make this pay off.

One final complaint - the player boards are kind of warped, thus making them move around all the time, not stable at all.  This makes the cube choosing part kind of annoying if you like to keep everything neat and straight.

Played three times with my 7-yo, and it works very well as an introduction to basic cube-pushing. It´s all here: drafting, points vs. abilities, clear goals, direct and indirect interaction. It may not be dripping with theme, but there is enough to keep the kids interested. Highly recommended as an introduction to various mechanisms. Works very well as a light 2-player for adults, too.

Burger joint is a game. It has mechanics. You do stuff. And it has a theme... that relates to what you do how?

What do the cubes represent? Are they foodstuffs that fall off a truck as it drives through town? If so, why does building more things make more fall off the truck? Do the white and brown cubes represent glass and wood? What truck would be carrying both food and construction materials? Why do the diner buildings allow me to claim specific ingredients? Do TV companies really accept food in payment for advertising? What the hell is going on in this town?

Forget the theme. It was applied just to give the artist something cute to draw on the components.

Mechanically the game is just drafting randomly drawn materials, converting those materials into other materials which may or may not score you victory points, and converting those new materials into more victory points. Its a foot-race between 2 players. A game of conversions with some contention created by drafting the components that your opponent may need.

Meh. I gave Burger Joint... (Haha. After having written a game's name out once I would normally be writing its initials here, but unfortunately people would think this review is about a very strange blowjob.) Anyway, I gave Burger Joint a poor score based on the severe disconnect between its theme and mechanics.

I think I could re-theme this game as a gang war in a poverty-stricken, war torn country where you fight over United Nations food and supply drops. Call it Mogadishu.

The initial read-through of the rules didn't look promising, but on subsequent efforts this has been a decent little brother to Caylus, although there's too much luck element to neutralise completely. The gentle acceleration as you progress helps to build tension and makes for a pleasing game length - more than a time waster but not enough to have to set aside the afternoon. The cube monopoly rule doesn't have as much impact as it should, though (we prefer playing that you have a monopoly at least one turn and until there are no cubes left in the centre), and I'm disappointed by how little the theme has been integrated: it should so easily have been a case of collecting foodstuffs rather than arbitrary cube-drafting.

Further Thoughts - once we ironed out some of the mis-readings of the rules, this makes a pretty tense affair. The big concern now is that it is too difficult to reverse an early lead, and that makes the 3-point diner a little over-powered.

A fun game for 2-players. One player is trying to build his Pizza business and the other a Hamburger business. Cubes are drawn from the bag each turn. Players divide the cubes according to what diners and special bistros they own. You can build more hamburger stands with your cubes or upgrade to a diner and eventually a bistro. You can also spend cubes to buy media. The first to reach the maximum points wins. It all depends on how you save/spend your cubes and whether the media strategy or the bistro strategy works out for you.

This is a two-player resource management game. Players are trying to build up their player board by creating buildings with different but equivalent costs, each of which will give them an advantage in collecting or trading resources, as well as possibly being worth points. Players can also invest in advertising, which allows them to steal from the opponent, as well as being worth points. It was a decent system, but there seemed to be a lot of stall and wasted turns as players tried to build up to the biggest buildings, but then hit the resource limit or got stolen from.

A fun diversion, but not a lot to get hugely excited about. There are much better 2P games available.

I have played this game only once, way back in 2012. I would not be averse to playing again, as it seemed to have a few unusual features. But it didn't interest me all that much either.

One thing I would complint about this game is, why would a pizza joint or burger joint produce cubes???? I was hoping I could start my own line of pizzas or burgers. Oh well.... this game is fun with building your joints and upgrading it.

 It's an ok game, nothing more. My g'f likes the Theme and told me not to trade it so it stays.

A moderately interesting 2p game.  I like the theme, but not the artwork.  The drafting works, but is not much "fun."

Absolutely, 100%, could not get into the theme of this.

RATING: 1.5
One of the worst gaming experiences in a long time. The mechanisms are not only boring but also fiddly. And while I'm not much into theme, this game could literally be about anything else, because there is no connection from gameplay to theme.

Not from The Works, but from EBay for a Fiver!

Great little empire building game. Fairly easy to understand as well... Bonus point for that...

Draw cubes from the burlap sack and try to use these to build resturants/bistros or gain extra publicity for victory points (12 needed to win).

Starts fairly slow, but soon picks up the pace. Every game so far has been very close (no more than 2 point winning margin). Also good interaction with your opponant in trying to block their tactics.

Set up time: 5 mins

Game time: 30-45 mins

Mindlessly shifting cubes around and largely ignoring the other player, glancing across only to see which diners he has built is not my idea of fun.

I found this to be an extremely simple and elegant design, with just enough choices to qualify for a low-stress two-player game. Good, but not great. My wife found Burger Joint to be an extremely simple design that becomes routine, repetitive and a tad boring. So, it goes on our trade pile. Perhaps not for us as a couple - we tend to play heavier two-player games like Agricola and Through the Ages, and consider things like Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper and Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers to be light fare - but I'd actually recommend this for couples who enjoy lighter games like Lost Cites.

A quick, little cube-pusher that I hope gets more exposure. This game packs a lot of strategy in such a light game. There are multiple avenues to victory which gives this game high replay value. I find my group turning to this as filler, but then playing multiple games in a row instead. Fun theme and great components only add to this games value.

My first play, I was unimpressed.  Take a bunch of cubes, turn them into a building that reserves a cube for you (for 1 pick).  It was clunky, and the mechanics didnt feel like they fit the theme.  I wouldnt say I dont like it, but I will say that I'm not sure I liked it.

Only tried this a couple of times so far and it is quite convoluted for a simple game. Willing to perservere though so it can't be all bad

I like these kind of cube pushing games.  This one has a lot going for it.  I like the cube drawing and drafting mechanic.  Upgrading your restaurant is next and there is even a take that element.  The art and components are fine.  The bag is even big enough to get my big hands into.

Definitely a "cube pusher", but fun nonetheless.  I'd like to try it again, but generally it seems like it is a worthy addition to the two player collection.

After a second play, I still like it, but absolutely no theme.  Let's see, my fancy diner produce yellow money (or is that mustard?) that I need to build my next burger stand . . .

Excellent two player game. You race to use resources to build better restaurants and thus score more victory points. The division of the resource cubes is nice.

Great game for the first 7-8 points, but the win happens too fast at that point. Also, it seems that the first player always wins.

Played this 3 times recently , each time was very similar to the previous game. Very dull cube collecting game, and on each occasion we both end up getting to 12 points on the same turn. Goes on too long as well.

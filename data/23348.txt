The cheap version of Khet (and much smaller box, to boot).  A pleasant abstract, but the only thing that sets it apart from Khet is the single-use "lasers" that migrate around the board.

Best not to give too much thought to Easter Island's theme. We are wizards manoeuvring stone moai so that sunlight deflects off their sides. If sunlight hits a moai in the face or on the back of the head, it's destroyed. Reduce all but one of your opponent's on board moai to rubble and you win. I did warn you.

Easter Island is really an abstract strategy game and a surprisingly good one.  Lining your moai up in a row is to invite a sunbeam.  Setting them up in a network to deflect beams around the board is much stronger.  Tempo is critical; a player forced into a series of defensive moves is going to lose.

Production quality is decent, though I'm not fond of the slight rubbery feel of the pieces.  The artwork is terrible.  The rules are reasonably clear.  Some examples of play are helpful.

Good use of plastic. This is a deeper game than I had initially thought.

RATING: 5.5
This is a pure abstract in which the initial play for setup position can decide more of the game than the actual play.  If the players setup poorly, the remainder of the game can be off quite a bit.  The rules describe the setup, but seem to focus more on the game play portion.  Assuming a good setup is in place, the game play feels like a standard light abstract.  It is not stellar nor is it horrid.  The drawback and unknown aspect of the game is whether a player can battle back from a defecit.  If not, it is possible the game lasts longer than necessary to determine the winner and if so, then the design could use some additional development.

Really good game for two.  It is really a mind crasher where you need to think about the future behaviour of the sun rays.  Good components.

Fun game!  Played two games with my son age 7.  First game I had to help him, and the second game he beat me.  Lots to think about and angles.  I will suggest this game for others who have kids.  Its easier to grasp than chess but helps them to start thinking strategically.  To get them started, I have them ensure that they have three statues on the board at all times.  This eliminate a quick loss.

This one is getting better the more I play it.

9/07  - Played this one with my 5/6 year old son.  He played it very well.  We played four games in a row and he loved it.  Battling statues is a great theme.

9/07 - Brought this one out for the wife who hates chess.  She could tolerate it because I kept saying that the moves are simpler than chess.  We'll see if she ever recommends this game.

RATING: 4
Components: Funny little rubber statues. Fairly bland board. Absurdly funny theme.

Experience: Very tactical. There are lots of opportunities for setting up forks and for taking my opponent by surprise. I must keep a careful balance between placement, orientation, and sun tokens. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

(This isn't the English version of Rapa Nui.)  Seeing this for about $10 everywhere gave cause for wonder, but also gave us an opportunity to pick this one up.  Very good 2 player abstract.  Learn in two mins - play takes about 30 up to 45 mins. sans AP.
One comment is that the triangular bases are sometimes hard to distinguish from the board.  We are trying a few solutions to address that, like adding a base to each of the pieces.  Reason for this is because it's no fun for either side if a move is missed just because the piece was hard to see.  Because the positioning of the bases is critical, it's important to address.  
The board is nice (the size is good), but perhaps fading the colors a bit would allow the pieces to stand out a bit more and solve the issue.  
A surprise recommendation.

I think this is a great 2 player game, simply because it's such an interesting concept, a great experience as you turn your statues and slide them across the board, following an imaginary light beam as it bounces from one statue to another as you try to get ahead of your adversary. While there is some A.P. the game is still very fast in my experience. I always lose against Tim but that's a good thing, a challenge is the spice of gaming (?)

I liked Easter Island. It's a nice abstract, quick to play and I didn't win. I want to play this again as I didn't get enough sunshine bullets down. It's nicely made, but the board's a little large for what it is. It would make a good travel game. I'm curious to see its price point.

Easter Island is a manual game of Khet, shooting sun rays/laser beams.  

This chess-like game has lots of strategy.  Every one gets the same pieces--no cards or dice.  Player order is the only significant advantage.  

This is really an excellent game, not as complicated as chess, but still a brain burner.  I love games of strategy, but just don't have patience for the brain burners.   It doesn't deserve the low rating I am giving it, it's just my personal preference--there are too many other 2-player games I will choose first.

This is a very clever 2 player game.  Deep strategy, multi-faceted gameplay... it has some similarities to Deflexion, but you have to imagine the lasers.  The board is a little dark - not very attractive - but the Easter Island statuettes are quite nice to look at.

Simple gameplay mechanics mask a surprisingly complex game.  Fun and challenging, Easter Island will occupy a prime spot in my playlist for some time.  Interesting if you enjoy thinking a bit during your game sessions, and even fun if you just go at it.

Wife and I like this one a lot though she seems to struggle with games of this type. (deflexion, etc) Place moai (easter island heads) on the island, place suns, rotate moai and turn on suns. if you bounce the light (imagined) onto an opponent piece, it's destroyed. If the beam leaves the board, last piece it touched is destroyed. Great components and a fun abstract game. Theme is a plus!as far as I know there is no plans 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
Just like chess, if chess pieces could shoot each other.  Plenty of analysis required; one of the more AP-inducing games I've ever played.  (Right up there with chess, actually.)  Obviously a game to avoid if you require all your games to be lightweight, but worth the effort if you're willing to be challenged by complexities that spin out from simple rules, as with Go.  (And chess.)

After two plays, I'm still at the stage of not really understanding what tactics are available or what the best strategy is. I won the first game to the sound of "so you've won, then." "Have I?" and lost the second similarly.

The basic questions of strategy are as follows (with first inklings of answers):
Where best to arrange the statues with respect to each other, friend or foe? (I'm suspecting the corners of rectangles)
How best to position sun markers? (pincering a lone opponents statue rank and file seems to guarantee a kill)
How use rank and file blocked by used sun markers to good effect ?(prevents pincering)

For me the test of any abstract is it being engaging enough fo me to play it a sufficient number of times to go through at least one strategy cycle (hitting on a good strategy and then finding a good counter strategy). I'm not sure I'm sufficiently enamoured to persevere with this one.

Positives: I quite like the five action options as it seems to give greater scope than most abstracts and the play aids are good quality.

Negatives: It's far from obvious what the good strategies are and the fact that the base prisms are 60* not 45* is particularly irksome to a physicist.

Every game should come with giant Moai pieces. This game is fun for what it is, a light (no pun intended) game of planning ahead to figure out angles by which you can destroy your opponent's Moai by moving and rotating said Moai around the 5X5 grid. Simple enough to play with your kids, but can take on a bit deeper strategy for adults. Not bad for an inexpensive game.

I just finished my second game of E.I. My first feeling is that it is a good light game for 2 players, ideal to spend some a good time after the dinner and before going to bed. I didn't spent a lot of time in debriefing and studying some strategies tonigh, just too tired...

I like this idea of this game, the cool figures, the pretty easy rules, but being as my game group is pretty much limited to family, I don't get to bring it out much.  For some reason my kids become mindless when we play it and it isn't fun for me.  If I could clone myself there might be some rousing games, not that I am great at it, but it would be equal opponents.  Nice price for the game, easy rules, really not much to dislike.

RATING: 7
Light abstract for two.  The components are of good quality with nicely molded plastic statues and a mounted board.  Uses a lot of the same mental skills as deflexion, but plays differently.  Each player has 8 sun tokens used to "fire" from points encircling a square grid which holds the players'   statues.  Each token can only be used once, and each point encircling the board can only hold one sun token, so as the game goes on your firing options become more limited.  When hit from one side, a statue bends the imaginary light beam.  When hit from the rear, front, or simultaneously on both sides the statue is destroyed.  Even if a statue successfully redirects the beam, it is destroyed if it is the last statue   hit by the beam.  

I liked this game and can't wait to explore its depth more fully.  I need more plays to see if it has legs, but getting more plays seems unlikely as my wife hated this.

Appears to be an excellent two player abstract but it felt way too much chess-like for me to enjoy the game.  Mechanics appear solid and interesting in that you perform two of a possible 5 actions during your turn:  place a statue, rotate a statue, move a statue, place a sun, flip a sun.

The funny thing about this game is that it's really not bad.  In fact, after just a few plays, it's become one of my favorite two-player games.  I like that it requires you to think and some strategic planning with placement of moai and sun tokens.  It's fun to trace out the path of the light beam and knock a piece off the board.  I'm glad I picked this one up!

I played this game a while ago. Played two rounds of it, mainly because I felt it was a little short. The first round –which was a full and complete game session- it only took us about fifteen minutes. The second time took about twenty-five minutes. I guess we started to think about or placement. 

One of the best things about this game is of course placement. Like in chess your have a set amount of moves you want to try to use, to defeat your opponent. Where as in Easter Island, you have to place your marker a few step ahead, and pray you don’t get side tracked along the way.

Another neat feature is the manipulation of your opponent’s rays, and Moai figures. This came in handy quite a bit towards the end of the second game. I gave this game an eight because I like the movement, and placement. I still have one more session to determine the winner – Tied one and one right now-

RATING: 6
Just an odd little duck of a game. I think my rating for it highly depends on who you are playing against. I just put a 7 because I can see it being from 6-8. I would say it gets unrepresented as a game, but that's par for the course with abstracts.

If you can deal with what little theme there is, it's game play is actually decent. Again, that depends on your opponent.

Played at DaveCon 2012.

Rating Potential: As stated before, 6-8 with much of it being who you are playing against.

Wow! I was not expecting much at all, but this game is really neat. A themed abstract that somehow manages to get the them match the abstractness of the game (?!). Gameplay is quite engaging and requires you to balance offense and defense -- the player who manages to use his pieces both defensively and offensively at the same time will win. I love how attacks must be "declared" one turn ahead of time, it gives the game a great "rythm"

Respectable abstract. There's a bit of a puzzley aspect to it; I'm sure some nice sequences are possible, although I haven't figured them out yet. A threat can be countered by another threat, by moving the piece being threatened, or by introducing a new piece. That's nice. Decent tension.

This one had to be gotten rid of because the missus claimed that it was so much like chess that she'd never get the hang of it. I do have my own reservations that the whole thing could be set up perfectly well on a standard chess-board, plus it has the potential to become unnecessarily over-complex and silly if you're attempting to analyse it seriously.

Plays much like chess - think rooks on steroids.  I really like the components and the usage of the beam weapons are interesting, especially how the angles can really change which pieces are eliminated.  This might be a touch low - it may be an 8.

I do like this 2-player puzzle game, even when I can't see everywhere you are going to zap me.  I do like the fact that you only get one shot per intersection, so you must constantly change your strategy.

If it wasn't too much brain burner I would rate it higher because it has some strategy feeling and everything is open information. The real problem is that it's too much chalenging and makes me want to quit.

An interesting and quick abstract game with cool bits. The theme is non-existent and ludicrous but it doesn't outstay it's welcome so that makes up for it.

A very boring and dry 2-player abstract.  I was disappointed in this one as they took a cool idea but forgot to include any fun in the game.

RATING: 7.5
Pros: Neat concept, seems well balanced.

Cons: Not the most beautiful abstract. Also rulebook was slightly confusing.

Final thoughts: An enjoyable abstract that doesn't do anything phenomenal but have no real beefs with.

A beautiful little brain-burner. Easy rules and soooo easy to make mistake after mistake. There are a lot of options to be considered all the time. Both of my children like the game.

saw this on BGwS and thought it looked really fun (I thought my wife would play this). Turns out to be just OK. I'll play when my son wants it (small box, travels well), but never ask for it myself.

Easter Island seems to take its inspiration from the laser-based Khet, but it smartly dispenses with the hardware.  Instead, the designers expanded the board and created an outer ring so that virtual beams can come from anywhere.  If truly played strategically, Easter Island is a brain-burner in the same time-zone as Chess.

Culled - First wave; Charity auction

Why we culled it: This was a gift from my sister when it was clear that I was in the full thrall of a hoarding frenzy. I was in my BGG honeymoon phase, where I just had to own ALL THE GAMES! She gave me this as a Christmas gift, which I happily accepted and tossed on the pile. Years later and a bit of consumer sobriety restored, this was one of the many games I realized that I had never touched and didn't really have the opportunity-cost allowance to consciously give it its due. So, it joins my (longer than I'd like) list of cautionary examples on the quest for balance. My sister noted that it was highly recommended to her at the point of purchase, so I suspect that someone out there may well find it a welcome addition. Cheers!

Simple rules and deep game play. Even though it is completely unlike Pente, it has a similar feel. The historically accurate theme is pretty cool too! ;)

This might be a pretty good game, but I'm just not into perfect information abstracts.  It is similar to Deflexion, but there is only one kind of piece and there are multiple places to "fire" from.  You can only fire from a location once and the goal is to hit an opponents piece directly from either the front or the back.  A side hit will be deflected forward.  Since the rebounding rules are simple, it was not hard to mentally track the laser's path.  The lack of a real laser didn't seem to affect the game much.

Although we like abstracts, this one doesn't appeal.

Необычная, свежая игра от малоизвестного производителя. По сути абстрактная. Сын меня в нее все время обыгрывает, хотя в абстрактно-стратегических он обычно послабее.

Abstract strategy; 2 players; speculates that the statues were, in fact, beam weapons created by two very powerful wizards. These wizards used the statues in a giant game, with the island itself as the board. You are now one of those wizards... Easter Island lets you place your statues and move them into position. Then, when everything is ready, call upon the power of the Sun to topple your opponent's statues and thus your opponent.

Very nice art, great statues. Concept is a bit bizarre, but I like it. And it is always good to have 2 player games around!

Donated to Goodwill.

2-player abstract game with "lasers". It requires thought and analysis, but the concept is pretty cool. It is like chess but simpler.

A bit of an odd game this one, perhaps I didn't get it and need to play some more? One day maybe, I've got too many other better games to play at the moment.

All skill and no luck game. I prefer a bit of randomness in my games. Feels like chess.

RATING: 6.5
I like this game, it's fun, but I'm also very bad at it and find it very challenging. The game is like a giant puzzle, trying to figure out the optimal placement of your statues and the direction they should face in order to hurt your opponent without hurting yourself (and to make it that he cannot hurt you without hurting himself). Surprised I like this game given its difficulty, but I do. It's a good theme and fun since I don't mind losing, it's a good brain exercise. PS. Upon rereading the rules, I think this has the potential to be a lot of fun. I'm not sure why I remember it as being only mediocre- and somewhat frustrating. It is indeed pretty tricky though that the sun destroys the statue from either the front or back, and that double hits destroy it. Evil!

Whenever people come over to play games, they are drawn immediately to this box.  I think this game has the most pleasing design, and is, for me, extremely challenging (ie, I never win).

I will be completely honest and say that when I pick up any game by Twilight Creations, I automatically assume it will require some tweaking on my part to spice up game play; however, that is not at all the case for this abstract addition.

I find this game to be the most satisfying among the Twilight Creations board game line.  It is fun, attractive, well made and definitely worth the price!  

I couldn't be happier and I am glad I picked this one up!

Coloca, mueve y gira tus moais. Coloca soles y hazlos brillar. Si en su la trayectoria la luz del sol toca un moai por el costado cambia de rumbo. Si lo toca por delante o por detrás es destruido.

Nice little two player game, and I loved the minis too.  Simple and strategic at the same time.  I was gutted I was outplayed in the game we played at GenCon...  :)

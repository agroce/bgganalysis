Plays quickly, yet still requires/rewards good play.  A definite keeper, if only to fill the "3 player, plays quickly, yet very little luck involved" niche.

That, and I'm a bit of a sucker for small-run, little-known games.

RATING: 5
{3 plays %u2022 4 & 5 player} I started out liking this one more, but now I'm not that impressed.  For one thing, it's all about the center, since that will offer you the best chance for multiple placement.  Ditto, staying with the pack (or most of it).  Well... after a few plays, that stopped being as fun for me.  I want the option of playing the edge (and the wrap-around the board coolness), or going it alone away from the pack to be viable strategies.  And they don't seem to be.  Additionally, there was almost never any reason to bluff, or not place a high tile first, because the game is so short and pieces are so limited, no one ever "knocked" you down (or capped you, or however you want to refer to it).  Maybe it's better with 3 or 2 - a lot of abstracts are - but I'm not that keen to try it and see.  I'd rate it lower, but it all works, and there are some interesting ideas here... but not for me, anymore, thank you.

Might enjoy if I had the slightest idea what I was doing.  Getting better towards the end, so need a 2nd play to make sure.
UPDATE: Played again, and found some control (but only 3 players, so easier). Interesting choices.

:d10-3::d10-4:

4/17: Wow! Block cycling makes this game SO much better. Even with only 3 players, the variant brings it close to a 10. I can't wait to play it with optimal player count AND block cycling.

3/17: 4 players is more interesting than with 3, although I would still play with 3. Have to remember to play with the 'block cycling' variant next time. Sounds like it elevates the game a couple of levels.

3/17: Played with both 5 (don't bother) and 3 (good, but not great). My high rating is mostly speculation about the 4-player game. This feels like a GIPF-family game made multiplayer. I really like the intersection aspect of stone laying, as you can threaten in multiple zones at once. The shared incentives to get Dolmens down is also great.

Multi player no luck abstract.  I only played with two and wow, there is a ton going on.  Play is straight forward but there is a lot to analyze and watch for.  Blocking, majorities, potential to jump someone for points.  The theme, even though it is thin, is cool.  I picture the druids on their bellies in the grass.  YAAAAA!  Did I mention the game is quick?  Quick and someone can push the tempo.  I like games like that I have found out.  I'm glad I tracked down a copy of this fine game.  I expect my rating to go up when playing three player.  Five would be insane.  I think three would be at its best.

I'm not a fan of abstracts, and this "pooping Druid" game is no exception.  There's a minor cooperative element in that in order to get points from any given region, there must be stones from 2 or more different players on the edge of that area.  This means that you need to position Druids (and drop your stones) near your opponents.

RATING: N/A
6/7/06 - first and only game so far was 2 player. Things I noticed - great colourful bits, simple ruleset, quick gameplay, need to watch out for missed majorities, need to balance placement of stones with how your opponents are doing ie. if they are constantly gathering herbs and moving without placing stones and you are usually placing stones on your turn, then you will run out of stones and basically sit and watch waiting for them to finish placing all their stones. To mitigate all this you need to play smartly and make sure that you end the game by getting all your dolmens placed. Nice game - need to play this more to plumb the depths which appears to be there.

An interesting take on area majority that works as a 20-30 minute filler.  The game offers some tough choices, and while the game works alright mechanically and is different from other area majority games, it just wasn't that interesting or fun for me.  I can't see myself choosing it very often above other filler games.

RATING: 8.5
Interesting area majority game with delicate decision timings and nicely balanced balance of power questions.  The game is rife with N-party Nash equilibria (viva detente!), where N is almost always smaller than the number of players.  Meaty, chewy but not brain burning.  Plays very well with 2, 3 and 5.  Need to try with 4 players.  I suspect that the sweet spot is either for 3 or 4 players. 

Updated on many further plays: The 2 player game is degenerate, 3&4 are most excellent with 4 seeming to be slightly better than 3, 5 is too chaotic to be worth playing.  

Background comment from Naturelich:

After doing some research you can find that Dolmen is the Breton term used to describe megalithic tombs (Wikipedia has more on Dolmen both in English and German with some neat pictures). Well, since Dolmen is not a German word: How can the game publisher expect us to understand? Why did they not use Hünengräber (the German word for megalithic tomb). Die Hünengräbergötter - try pronouncing that. That's even too difficult for the German tongue, plus it sounds extremely strange to my ears, because it's probably the only word which contains all three different German umlauts.

We played two games of this. It is very fast but yet provides some real brain burning opportunities and room for clever tactics and strategy. One thing that is intriguing is that some of the rules seem to suggest using a slower approach but we didn't think this was wise at all. The players seem to group together to quickly score regions. I can't see hanging back as a winning strategy but the rules allow you to take a turn to build up magic to allow your druid to fly and you can also vacate a "point" without leaving a stone. Neither of these seem like a good strategy except in the rarest of circumstances. Perhaps repeat plays will lead to a more evolved strategy. As it turns out I had a rule wrong. I thought you could jump over both druids and stones but you can only jump druids not stones so the game does indeed slow down a bit and the moves become more strategic. You may very well want to fly your druids around. Its very unusual for me to get a rule wrong this only happens about 3 games out of 5.

RATING: 7
A nice and not-too-difficult majority game which plays very quickly and has a few subtle twists. The majority aspect is simple but delightful, but it's not as easy as you'd think at first. For one thing, if you allow yourself to get caught in a create majority-get even-create majority cycle, you'll just be aiding another player while you get stuck with a position on the bottom of the dolmen stack. So at times&mdash;quite a lot of times, in fact&mdash;you'll simply move a druid without placing a stone in order to maneuver your druid into a position where you [i]can[/i] score a nice whallop of points in return for giving someone else a point boost. However, you cannot dally too much (especially not in the beginning, when you just have 4 points to play with) because once your stones run out, you're no longer in a position to influence any stack of dolmens because [i]you[/i] want to change them. The game is full of these little subtleties which you only begin to notice after several plays. The only thing which really is a bit out of whack is the fact that the dolmen are placed face down and therefore a source of double guessing and uncertainty. But in a game without any source of luck whatsoever there should be a little something to keep everyone on their toes.

Something which [i]really[/i] irks me is the lack of a good 2-player variant. With just the two of you, it is quite easy to avoid each other to the point where the game breaks down. With 3 players, it is easier to start up a little duet to attempt to lock out the third player, and from that moment on the game begins to live. I like this game for what it sets out to do and eventually achieves. It should be rife with multiple player chaos, but it's not because the overall game can be easily broken up into several mini-games, all connected together in ever-changing ways through the stones and the druids. As I'm writing this, the closest game I can think of which pulls this off is the venerable Go. Not a bad game to borrow some ideas from, even if, perhaps, the similarity was unintentional.

Totally abstract game which could have been improved a lot with a nicer board which comes down to a lot of tactics, some strategy and some bluffing. You get like 10 turns during the whole game, so it's over pretty fast. Luckily, because I think your options are too few so that it gets boring too soon.

The presentation, the components, and especially the rulebook leave a lot to be desired, but if you ignore all that, there is actually an excellent multiplayer abstract game hidden inside here.  It's area control, but with a novel twist of having to cooperate with other players to be able to score the areas.  The rules are simple enough, and the games are pretty tense and always interesting. An overlooked gem, but one that needs a retheme and a complete overhaul of all the components.

RATING: 7
Players move their druid pawns around a maze like path of stone circles, leaving behind a standing stone on their departure space.  As the standing stones begin to form stone circles along the path, majorities of stones start to form, allowing a scoring piece to be placed in the circle (a multiplier of the circle's value).  All sounds confusing, but this is a very simple and elegant game of movement and position.  Turns are very quick, the decision making process isn't too heavy, and the game plays in about twenty minutes.  Good game.

Wasn't that great. Quite a bit of the game is the initial placement of your pieces, as only a section of the board gets used. If you are away from the majority of the other players, you will not do very well, as you are dependant on the other players to help you score.

I'd like to try this again, as I wasn't happy with the end-game. I had 4 remaining stones, the other players were able to block me from keep places which would have scored me points, but suffered no penalty having spent all their stones already. Unfair and a poor finish. I wasn't impressed with the production, poor graphic design, but the game is very simple and quick to play.

Dolmengötter is a fairly dry and abstract area majority game. It's not very pretty, either. But it's different. For example, majorities are scored on the area borders, there are important spatial restrictions on where you can place your stones, there is value in losing (and reaquiring) majorities, and the game enforces grudging cooperation between players.

To top it all off, it's over after half an hour, a niche that is commonly reserved for smaller card games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very abstract. I'm starting to see the subtle strategies, like taking negative points to escape from a region dominated by another player to avoid giving them a majority. It seems strange that the board remains almost empty at the end of the game, but maybe that's because we haven't been *really* nasty yet. I find the design of the game to be particularly uninspiring.

I've really enjoyed my playings of the game so far. I'm intrigued by the scoring system and how players must share the wealth in order to score points. However,this is another game where it's important to explain to new players how the game can end and that they should evaluate the game before making a move. I've seen too many times where one player is allowed to play out their dolmens at a faster rate than everyone else because his "faithful servant"(the new player) is happy to place an area tying dolmen at the bottom of the scoring stack allowing the "Dolmen Dumper" the opportunity to play another of his domens on top of the scoring stack.

I wish I could say this was bubbling over with excitement.  It's a little dry, and very abstract, but it does pack a real game with some unique play and interesting decisions into a 30 minute package.  Players move their three "druids" around the vertices pictured, placing "stones" as they leave.  The special characteristics are: 1) as in Australia, stones placed are in multiple scoring areas 2) scoring opportunities only occur when at least two players have placed stones in an area.  The game thereby creates many interdependencies as a stone may help you in one circle while helping a neighbor in another shared circle.  The need to place your best scoring blocks ("dolmens") in the highest scoring opportunities also creates resource management issues.

I do find that each play reveals more strategic considerations - a good thing.

It won't take over the world, but it fills a nice need for a fast strategic game.

RATING: 7
I can understand why this is popular with the guys from the Winsome crowd. As in Chicago Express and quite a few other of their titles, it's important to set yourself up to benefit from other players' actions. Without concurrent moves from the opponents, no player will gain points. Claiming advantages among competitive players is a subtle process of benefitting slightly more than giving others. In the end, it's most likely that a mistake will have more influence on game result than any positive action. Such titles interest me in principle but only shine on rare conditions where the right experienced crowd comes together. Otherwise, there's a non-neglectable potential for disappointing results.

This is a pretty clever little game.  It qualifies as one of those meaty fillers - games that feel satisfying, but also go very quickly, like Mykerinos.

All the wood bits are nice, and there are quite a few interesting decisions to be made on each turn.

A good game of semi-cooperative tension and influence.  By building stones on points along the lines of octagon, hexagon and square areas, it allows your druids to place scoring tiles within those shaped regions.  These score tiles are multipliers that can stack up to certain heights.  It is a very clever abstract that plays very well with multiple players.  The game forces you to help each other buildup scoring areas b/c you cannot place tiles with areas that are only built by one player.

Fairly quick area majority game where you can choose one of three options on your turn:  1.  move druid and leave a stone in his former spot (or don't place a stone and pay a 1 point penalty), 2.  place a druid on its belly (to prepare for flying to any other open square in a future move), or 3.  fly a druid on its belly to any open space on the board.  One scores by having a majority of stones left behind by the druids but one cannot score until at least two players' stones are in the same circle.  It is an interesting game, but there are other area majority games I prefer to play over this one.

A gem of a game. Reminds me of Odenhoven's Portobello Market, but this one's much better. Area majorities on the borders of the areas, that's clever, and the way you need friends to succeed. It gets even better: a game is over in 20-30 minutes and leaves you wanting for more. I like this one a lot, it's my favourite filler right now.

The game is very, very good with four, but unfortunately doesn't work as well with other player counts.

An abstract area control game, where one has three druids on the map, and when a druid moves, a stone is left in the druid's location. These stones are used to compute majorities surround squares (3 pts), pentagons (4 pts) and hexagons (5 pts). Whenever a player ties or takes the lead in a shape, they may slide a scoring tile (ranging from 1 to 4) into the stack of scoring tiles. The scoring tile is multiplied by the location in the stack, and the shape. It's a short game, not too bad, but the starting players seem to have an advantage.

It seems like its best to be the first in an area. It's difficult to gain control of an area if you are second in it, so it's best to avoid being the second in an area if you can. An interesting area control mechanism.

RATING: 7
First impression: It's a good abstract area control game that works very well with at least 4 players. I especially liked how you must cooperate with other players to get points. If you're alone in an area you cannot have any points from it. I'm surprised that I liked it that much as it is a) almost a full knowledge game b) really an abstract. Luckily there is hidden information as the values of dolmens are unknown. This makes the game a bit faster. Or at least it should be as this game doesn't offer too much more if played for an hour. As a half hour game it is a one of the better short abstracts that work really well with 4 players.

A light area control game that really is quite good for what it is.  The adding to top and bottom of the stack is very interesting, but I wouldn't call this game fun.

Easy to learn, fast to play game! Can still be a brainburner! Nice decisions throughout. The production seems a little bland, but the game itself is good for 20-30 minutes fun! Why must this game be produced in a such ugly way?

RATING: 7
Simple, plays fast, clear components, tends to be fun also.
Can't complain!

You can put yourself in quite nasty situations where you either are stuck and need to use a couple of rounds to get some elsewhere or worse than that: get your meeple to a place where he can't move (or could but by doing so would give easy points to another player).

It's clever system that no points are received if somebody is the only player around a numbered place.

RATING: 9
One of current favorites. No-luck abstract that has players using druids to build a majority of stones around areas to place dolmens which are used to score. You may score more than once in an area however and sole ownership does not allow you to score (at least two colors must be present). Lots of fun without burning too much grey matter since the game only lasts about 25 minutes.

RATING: 6.1
Interesting as an abstract, gives a good number of choices available each turn with considerable player interaction. Rating may go up with more plays, but I usually prefer games with a closer relationship between theme and game mechanics, unless they're purely abstract.  This is a good game, but didn't have much of a 'fun' factor to it.

An interesting abstract area control game.  Quick enough to almost be filler, but with enough strategic depth to be fun.  However, the board layout (edges) is confusing.

--Dec2006-- Tried now with both 2 and 3 players.  Very dry with 2 - but the game is delightful with 3; I'm very interested in trying with more!  The dolmen play is quite interesting:  early play of a large-valued dolmen requires significant re-investment to protect, but with some care a large late play is possible.  Could possibly move up to an 8 if it proves to have some staying power:  the 20 minute play time really helps there.
--June2008-- Cool: 4 players is even better.
--Sep2010-- And now, after trying each of the player counts, I distinctly prefer 4.  3 and 5 are ok, too; but 4 is really nice.

Awesome abstract area control game that really brings many new ideas to the table.  The way the game forces you to work with others to get points yet enforces a need to control an area sits well with me. It is quick and light and while it is an abstract the theme is entertaining enough to keep the illusion alive through till the end of the game.

Surprisingly good diamond-in-the-rough area control game. I really enjoy how when you move your pieces around, you have the option to place towers which affect the areas you're controlling, and it makes it somewhat a route-making game in that you generally can only move linearly.

RATING: 7
Simple abstract game played on a magical wrap-around "Ireland" that has been divided into squares, hexes, and octagons. The larger areas are worth more points. Players move their pieces around the board from vertex to adjacent vertex (but can leap over adjacent pieces or chains of pieces), leaving a marker token in the space they left. If placing your marker creates a situation where there are 2 or more colors on that space, whoever has majority their gets to place their marker (numbered 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4) face down: if you have majority, you put it on top, if you tie you put it underneath the other markers already there. When any player places their last scoring marker, everyone else gets one round. Scores are calculated for each space as the multiple of the number on the marker (1-4) and the position on the stack ... top is worth full value (square spaces 3, hexes 4, octagons 5) and each lower one is worth one less. Whoever has the most points wins.

A solid abstract game that plays very quickly.

Seems to be an intense abstract game with some potential. I have to play it again to see how it works with 3/4 players. Do not play it with 2 players because it doesn't work. Actually this is one of those games that should have 3-5 players writen in the box.

If you think you're going to be a druid in whatever form it may get you, you can give up of that thought! Too much imagination needed for being whatever. Abstract in a pure form. Still, not sparkling.

ERRATA DER SPIELREGEL:
Liebe/r Dolmengötter-Freund/in,
wir bedauern sehr, dass es in der beiliegenden Spielregel zu folgendem Druckfehler gekommen ist:
* S. 4: "2.1 Dolmen setzen: Sobald nach dem Setzen eines Druiden…" => Druiden muss durch Steins ersetzt werden.
* S. 4, rechte Spalte: "Min. 3 Druiden..." => Druiden muss durch Steine ersetzt werden.
Wir bitten um Verzeihung und wünschen viel Spaß beim Spielen!

Five is clearly too many to play with. The game was over really before it had begun, but oddly didn't really leave me wanting more. It just felt premature.

I'm sure (and I'm told) it's far better with four, but I can't really say I have the desire to confirm this. 

It seems to be highly dependant on others working with you, with relatively limited space for clever play, in order to achieve goals.

It's an interesting game of jostling around to manipulate majorities/ties with the scoring markers frustratingly blocking further movement. There's also a metagame of figuring out where players have heavily invested their scoring tiles.

A very elegant abstract for 4 that plays quickly.

Giving this one a 5 as there is nothing at all wrong with this game. It succeeds on all levels that it attempts to. For me however it just isn't that much fun. Playing this one made me want to play Medina. If I had both games side by side and wanted to play this sort of game, Medina would be it every time.

Played with four (the optimal number of players according to BGG) and loved it. It plays incredibly fast with very little downtime and a short playing time.

One game, basically an abstract area control game with a pasted up theme. It has some good ideas.

Updated after the second play, I liked this more now. It was faster and I had some idea, but I didn't completely understand the scoring (even though I thought I did) until the end, which might have cost me victory.

I love relatively short but deep games (King of Siam and Greentown being other examples). Nothing else feels like this game. Make sure to play with the alternate endgame rule suggested in the forums, wherein dolmens recycle back into your hand and the game ends when the last stone is placed. BEST WITH 4!

Wonderfully designed game which maximizes tactics and command with quick and relativley easy game mechanics.  My number one choice for 6mm wargaming.  I love this game.

Good alternative to 'Flames of War' and has all the army lists included.  These rules are great for mass battles.  I have put on several games at conventions.  Sometimes I run games with action cards.

This is a really fine set of miniatures rules and since all you need is the one rulebook, it is a great value to boot. My armies are painted 10mm which is a nice size to work with.

I've only managed to get 2 full games in, but enjoyed them enough to put together 3 battlegroups (armies) for different nationalities for some pre-1943 games in 6mm. The command and control aspects are out of Warmaster, but modified to suit WW2. 

My only complaint is that unit detail is sacrificed for simplicity of play. Only superficial stats are assigned for vehicles, so tanks from one nation play like those from another. The 'flavor' is derived almost exclusively from the difference in Command Value (rating) for each nationality. At $60 for a 6mm battlegroup, not so much of a concern. The descriptions of 'complete in one book' are a bit misleading, as no TO&E are provided in the book. Unit stats are provided for a bunch of stuff from each nationality, but that's it. For anybody just starting into WWII gaming without knowledge of historical organizations, this might be frustrating, or lead to wildly off-balance games. Access to a nice online battlegroup generator is provided free for one year after purchase.

Some players are frustrated by the possibility of failing command rolls, thus sitting out turns but personally, that's one of the appeals. If that truly bothers you, there are things that can be done within the existing rules to mitigate that risk. The game should not be judged by one bad game! Learn the subtleties, and it's quite enjoyable.

Game of WWII based on Games Workshop's Warmaster system.  Emphasis is on command control (must make leadership die roll to activate units).  Combat is very abstract (try to accumulate enough hits on a unit to knock it out - if not enough hits are made during your turn, the hits that were accumulated are erased).  Not for people who crave gun vs armor charts.  Book is complete with all army lists (including the Pacific Theater and the Spanish Civil War) and many generic scenarios (a point system is used). Can be used with any basing system (including Flames of War basing).  Any miniature scale can be used but works best with 6mm-15mm (the game's author uses 10mm).

Dreadful. poor movement system and concentrate on wearing down a tanks shield to destroy it ir it will regenerate. sounds nothing like WW11 to me.

It's a simple "beer and pretzels" WWII game.  The game designer is very accessible on the games forum for questions, and it looks like a new edition update may be on the horizon for this great game covering accumulated errata, FAQ, and potential unit additions / adjustments.  Not the most technical or stat heavy WWII game out there, but in this case that is its strength.  Works great with GHQ or 6mm to 15mm minis.  I Love it!

2013-12-24 : I don't get what other people see in this ruleset. It's clunky and doesn't give a correct period feel

RATING: N/A
This game borrows heavily from the mechanics used in the Warmaster game from Games Workshop, and looks very interesting.

I haven't been able to give it a try yet, but hope to soon as it seems to provide an interesting alternative to the Flames of War system, with more emphasis on command & control, and less emphasis on national characteristics derived largely from propaganda and Hollywood portrayals.

Very affordable ruleset for WWII. The rulebook is very well written and contains some great pictures. The mechanics look a loth like warmaster of GW. The price is very different though!

Hey, I succeded in my third command roll and shoot a second time, and not much is left to shoot back. Oops, I messed up my second role and my units are going to get destroyed. Can't see the fun in that, may as well just roll a d6.

Not the most detailed set of WW2 miniatures rules out there but that is positively an advantage for large battles and team play.   These rules are quick-playing, simple enough to explain to a newcomer in a few minutes and still give plausible results.

The second edition has lost the first's campaign rules (which is a shame) but has gained better integrated opportunity fire and better implemented rules for infantry in buildings/fortifications.

A really good game that forces the player to consider using combined arms when selecting their army.  Simple movement and firing make the game easy to pick up and understand.  Command and control is not guaranteed every turn.  I am playing in 15mm and I am loving it.  Great game.

To me, the table feels crowded by the figures (but then, I play this game with Russian infantry, so what could I expect?)  It does not feel quite sim-like enough for my taste, but it is the only game besides Spearhead that I am interested in for playing at division level.

A reasonable wargame, great emphasis on command and control and combined arms warfare.  Very good support from the Author on his website and forum.

Not quite convinced with the combat mechanics, models take multiple hits and eventually are removed, but if you dont take them out that turn, they start the next turn totally undamaged.

There are of course optional rules in the book to leave hits on, which is what we did.

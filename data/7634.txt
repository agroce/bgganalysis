Played (solitaire).

Fun, but there was a tendency for the two armies to stand off with 11 hexes between them, to prevent hit-and-run raids by the opposing armored divisions.  The move-fight-exploit mechanism needs to be replaced with a more nuanced interleaving of activities.

This was purchased as a toe in the water to try the Europa system. The mixture of what seems (to me anyway) to be operational elements, like the air and supply game, with strategic elements just did not seem right at this scale. In summary, it was more detail than I want to deal with in a theatre-sized game. Won't give it a bad rating, because it seems to me a matter of taste. Sold.

My favorite Europa game.  Rules are still simple enough to be easily learned and because of the low counter density in this game, it plays pretty quickly.  Feels historically accurate yet I still feel like battles can go either way in this game.

Acquired via eBay (August 2013) - unpunched, near mint and a genuine bargain.

Interesting to compare the map detail and OOB with the later and very playable War in the Desert (GRD) which combines this, Torch and Near East (neither of which GDW games I have or plan to get ... well not yet anyway).  

Western Desert covers the arguably "more interesting" period of the North African Campaign.

A very good game. No bugs in the rules, low counter's density and very challenging.
The Italians have a very good chance to succeeed with their offensive.

Awesome Start for the Europa Series. Good way at learning before moving on to a larger campaign. Supply can be painful if not manages properly. Gives a good feel for the downtime and waiting to see which opponent is going to jump and start the offensive.

An excellent Desert game covering Malta through to the Syria and everything in between including Cyprus. The ebb and flow of warfare is depicted very well. The victory point schedule encourages aggressive and historical play and couples well with the potential use of Axis paratroopers in theatre. Such use remains an Axis strategic advantage, a VP weakness and an Allied fear yet not an unbalancing one. In my opinion this game is superior to the GRD version of the game "War in the Desert". This game contains some of the most coveted units in all of the Europa series: the 0-8 Light Tank battalions. Played this game over twenty times and seen a very good distribution of outcomes centred on the historical result. Have played the game so much that many of my counters are disintegrating. The panzer divisions are clearly faded!

Still my North Africa game of choice after all of these years. Frank Chadwick has designed many great games but Western Desert may be his magnum opus. I think it is also the best and most playable Europa game available. If you want to learn Europa (at least Europa before it became an over-bloated mess), I can't think of a better game than this.

This was my first attempt with Europa series. At a first glance I thought it was going to be the typical hex & counter system but I discovered why this is one of the oldest and durable game series. Western Desert, covers part of the Africa conflict with a special role for Italian forces. Air rules are clear, simple and really effective. Naval transportation, air and seaborne operations, armour special rules for attack and defense and anti aircraft fire, fills a complete set of II World War actions for conflict simulation. Game reflects all the problems Axis had to face, specially supply and reinforcements transportation from Europe to Africa. In the other hand, Allies have a initial weak situation. It is critical for Allied player, to hold his line in the first six turns. Definitely, a great game series, an interesting  issue and only one drawback inside this one: the frontline usually trends to get stuck.

Still not too sure on this one. My friend back east enjoys it. I am just not too fond of Europa series games. Maybe it will change as this is my favorite theatre. Complete and in very good, punched, condition.

Europa treatment of North Africa, covering the early war in Libya, Egypt, and parts of the Middle East. Components are typical Europa: two maps and about 500 counters, charts and OBs for the period. This game, 'Torch', and the 'Near East' were all combined into the 'War in the Desert' title which I would recommend.

I give this game an 8 rating because, like all of the Europa games, they are very good games based on a great system.  I resent to this day however, the fact that GDW sold this series of games based on eventually being able to link them together to play out the entire WWII and never fulfilled that promise.  Call it a rant.  Call it sour grapes.  Call it whatever you will.  But it still leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth.

First 'big' game I played, first time we played it, we spent over 26 hours at the table, and only got half way through it! That was over several weekends. I was the Allied and had to sit there and wait while my oppenent counted air factors to get a 4:1 as all his ground units had no combat supply! But I liked it.

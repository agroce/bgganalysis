El mejor de los juegos NAC que tuve y que compré allá por los 13 años. Me arrepiento de haberlo vendido en su día.

Aún con sus defectos, es un buen juego. Divertido (sobre todo si se juega con la variante del 6 de Junio) y con multitud de unidades especiales reflejadas con su estética particular (batallones tiger, divisiones SS, Patton,...). Diseñado sin los medios actuales, creo que era un juego clásico y divertido para la época.

En su contra tiene también para mí bastantes argumentos, en eso no me dejo llevar por el sentimentalismo.
Condiciones de victoria un poco raras, mecánicas de retiradas y pérdida de pasos discutibles, mucho conteo de factores y se tiende a hacer una lucha por Caen demencial (mucho más que la histórica) contra los ingleses y se suele desguarnecer el resto de la línea alemana (de hecho esta se acaba formando mucho más atrás de como ocurrió realmente)... Praticamente todas las divisiones panzer y los batallones de tiger acaban en las inmediaciones de Caen para obtener superioridad contra Monty, mientras que el resto del frente da pena.

Actualmente es un juego superado, pero no olvidemos que es de 1985.

Played once, the Germans high-tailed it for the border and won before the Aliies could get out of the starting blocks. No doubt fixable with a change to the victory conditions or the turn order but the days of tweaking a mediocre or bad game into shape are long gone, these days there is always another new game to step up to the plate. Will likely never play again.

SPI magazine version

This flawed gem is a tense and enjoyable game that gives one side the challenge of building an adaptive defense (with the occasional counter attack) and the other the challenge of cracking the egg.   This combination of roles makes Cobra a good choice for solitaire play.

Unfortunately, the past 30 years have shown that the original magazine version hadn't been play tested very well.  Extreme strategies by the German player particularly can result in very ahistorical outcomes.  Most games end in turns 7 to 9 as an Allied breakthrough threatens a large encirclement, and the German mechanized units take advantage of a turn of foul weather to escape off the map's Eastern edge.

The game suffers from two flaws, the bloodless CRT and the victory conditions, both of which tilt the game in favor of a wily German. 

The CRT never requires a combat loss, as long as the defender is able to retreat.  This allows the German to leapfrog retreating units in a defensive chain referred to as the "conga line" defense.  Why units that are out gunned, after all modifiers, by odds like 9:1 should be allowed to retreat 3 hexes in the bocage without a loss in manpower while the attacker is only able to advance 1 hex in that same terrain is a bit of a mystery.  The solution may be to require units to take their first step loss as an actual step loss before being able to retreat to avoid further losses, and to limit retreats in bocage for both the attacker and the defender.

The second flaw is the victory conditions, which do not require the German to play the game for more than 7 turns, if even that long.  Once the Allies have been deprived of their points for exiting units off the South Western edge of the map by turn seven, their is *no* reason for the German player to keep any units on the board as any further German combat losses equate to the Allied victory points.  Conversely, the Allies score no points for capturing cities or exiting units off the Eastern edge of the map, regardless of how early they are able to accomplish the feat.  I would never play Cobra in a tournament, unless new victory point conditions were being used, as I see no way that a competent German player could loose.

To be fair, the Germans' withdrawal is not a sure thing and must be carefully handled lest too many infantry units be left on the board for the Allied player to entrap and eliminate for victory points.

So the gem has flaws, but it is a gem.  It challenges both players (and the solitaire gamer), can be very engrossing, and generates a good deal of tension.  Cobra well deserves a spot in the collection of any wargamer interested in World War 2 at the operational level.

This is an interesting situation. The Germans don't have a lot of men to cover the entire front-line. However, the U.S. forces have limited supplies and can only make a small number of attacks each turn.

One of the best STRATEGY AND TACTICS magazine issue games that brought the PANZERGRUPPE GUDERIAN system to the Western Front.  Not quite as successful as its Eastern Front father, but quite successful enough--it's gone through two revision/update editions.  The German must be patient and wily to limit the Allied advance, even given Allied Air Superiority.  It ain't easy.  The Allies, even with the preponderance of combat power, can't do everything they'd like to do and have to prioritize well.  Recommended.

Despite its flaws I still enjoy playing this one. Though the CRT is relatively bloodless (step losses are not mandatory unless there is no retreat option available), the German line will be cracked at some point, and at this point the Germans will likely have to use some of their mechanised units to plug holes. So sending off too many mech units early could come back to bite the German player.

Review of the S&T magazine version - replayed in 2015.  based on the PGG model - this is the invasion of France - WW2 - not the landings at D Day - but the breakout at Caen and Falaise - lots of boccage -- British, Canadians and US vs German -- man of the german units are understrength and the big panzer and SS divisions are too few - seems like a easy win for the allies - but have seen a tenacious german defense on occasion - not really fun to be german-- as the opportunity for any meaningful offensive action is extremely limited.  Still a solid game - maybe 3 hours play time.

Maybe I just don't get it.  If you can take a step loss or retreat, is it possible to ever eliminate a German unit?  They just fall back and fall back.  The allies can't afford to fall back beacause they have to keep the pressure up.  They have to take the step loss.  Definate bleh for me.

Excellent topic and many nice game mechanics. However, game play was a bit plodding, and it took forever to finish. The game is very static at the outset and requires substantial patience. Granted, this exactly models the campaign being simulated, but it makes for difficult gaming in the early turns. On second thought, I think this might work well solo. German options are really pretty limited, so one might try different Allied strategies to see what happens. It really does look pretty cool when it's first set up--that huge line of troops facing off against each other in the bocage country.

Looked good at the time, especially for an SPI magazine game.  Two problems: 1) there is no real answer to some very gamey tactics which the German player can use to guarantee a win; and 2) the designer has completely failed to understand the infantry-support role of the independent tank brigades in the Commonwealth armies, which means that the Commonwealth forces are both heavily under-rated and also forced to operate in an ahistorical way.

This is one of the best magazine games I ever played. Allied chances depends on overruns and supply. Apart, they get more air power support in fair weather and Germans get less movement. German player depend absolutely on their capacity to hold their lines. If Allied break the front and encircle, Germans are finished. Game is based on a combat system in which defender choose between retreating or losing strenght points. Thats an advantage for defender  and German player should manage it to have chances about winning the game. Alied player should try to break the front at any point, this is crucial, specially for the American sector becuase they need to exit at least one division in order to avoid losing VP points before seven turn ends. I recommend to play both, Alied and German to get the whole flavour about this game. A must have.

Standard SPI style operational system. Regiment/Division level treatment of the breakout from Normandy. Good late '70s SPI fare. Rules aren't cluttered with chrome, but the game definitely has its own personality. Good (not great) counters, better than average Simonsen map, and a desperate situation for the Germans. But it isn't a walkover for the Allies; a good German player and a little bad luck can keep the Allies bottled a good long while - long enough to win the game on points anyway.

I had the original S&T magazine version, but it was lost in one of the moves. I enjoyed this game quite a bit for an SPI game, and would consider replacing it in my collection if the price was right.

First game I ever got. Played just few times and no really bad memories about the game, not too good either. Sold soon after.

Un juego excelente, con reglas muy asequibles y detalladas. Su único inconveniente es que, al utilizar el Sistema TRC (Tabla de Resultados en Combate) se hace necesario a veces una calculadora para determinar la columna de resolución. Por lo demás, un wargame clásico muy bien diseñado.

Excellent title on the breakout from Normandy in WWII in which the Allies strive to cut off and destroy as much of the German Army as possible while advancing. The game plays very well, tends to be moderately exciting, and though there is a controversey about a 'solution' for a German win, it's not at all that clear to me such a formula win exists. The game remains exciting and successfully holds the imagination, permitting you to play your opponent more than the system in my experience.

My favorite S&T game.  Turned me from a wargamer into a wargamer geek.  Tough for the Germans to hold out with the weather rules, but I love it, great graphics and counters for the time.  Good challenge for the defensive specialist.

Uses well known Panzergrouppe Gudarian system but suffers from poor development as the Germans can simply run off the map before the Allies can stop them.

The game mechanics are pretty decent.  Unless you block off all retreat paths, the generous retreat rules allow you to retreat in lieu of taking step losses.  Between the weather reduced movement factors and terrain, much of the German counters could be unable to move for many turns.  Ends up in a slow grind at first, but once breakthrough occurs the Allies can start moving armored divisions so fast the Germans can't catch up.  Not a bad game, just nothing special either.

Fair enough. Good, but not awesome.

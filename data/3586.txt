RATING: 7
Great fun!  You can have only 6 cards in the circle for very young kids, play to as many winning cards as you lkie (instead of 6), or have 10-12 cards in the circle for adults/older kids.

My kids like it, the German name sounds funny and the cards are lovely and thick and colourful.

One of the best memory games.

The kids and I really enjoy this game.  It's fast and fun.  To watch my kids trying to remember what the picture is, it's so funny.

The cards are much thicker than I thought they would be.  Very good quality.

it's kinda criminal to get the sherlock version instead of der plumpsack.  fun memory game, would work well with kids or party situations.  it seems like some shuffling should be done after a card is won though, the card pattern that leads to victory just gets run down too often otherwise.  for a memory game, i don't think it's much of a memory game.

My almost 4 years old and I played for the first time yesterday Plumpsack (AKA Sherlock) and she loved it... by the way she won as far as she has better memory than me.

Rated as a kids game.  The best memory game I know of for kids.  Kids as young as 4 can play it, but adults can join in and have fun too.  

However, it is definitely a memory game rather than a memory-and-deduction game as the cover art says.  The deduction element is pretty non-existent (I suppose the idea is that in theory you can recall patterns such as "if I turn over this card, its arrow points to the card two to the left, which in turn points one to right, which in turn  again one to the right, which takes me back to the first card and makes for an easy turn."  But who can remember the arrows and numbers like this?  And even if you could that would still be 95% memory and only 5% deduction.)

In short:  if you like memory games, you will like this.  If you don't like memory games, you will find this more tolerable than most such games, but you probably won't enjoy it a whole lot.

UPDATE:  It seems like someone wised up and removed "deduction" as a mechanic for this game.  Rightly so.

6 for my 6-year old daughter and 4 for me.  I only paid $CDN 5.99 for it at Winners (yes, the clothing store).  It is not worth paying more.  The cards are oversized and very sturdy.  Good quality.  I like getting games that she likes to play.  I shouldn't be complaining about playing this game; how can I complain when her 3 favourite games are Sherlock, Samurai and Blue Moon?

RATING: 8
Gave it an 8 because of the sheer simple fun we've had every time we've played it.  But if you're the type, like us, who generally like more complex or "evolved" games, just make sure you play Sherlock when you are either very tired (after exam week for example, or after many complex games in a row) or tipsy-drunk.  The game then takes all its splendor!

Otherwise, I would also recommend it for playing with kids or elders or people who don't like to play complicated things but still loike challenges.

The cool part about this game is also that it's scalable.  If you think it's too easy, then just add more cards in the circle.  Let me know when you reach 16 without problem!  Or if you're playing with young kids or memory-deficient elders, then remove some cards from the center circle.  It'll make it more enjoyable.

All in all, a very simple game and concept, but it's efficient and it provides fun and laughter for your group pretty much consistently, as long as you don'T take it too seriously.

This is a great little memory game. Unfortunately, I don't particularly care for memory games. I also have no idea what's up with that creepy looking scrotum guy on the box cover.

The game's great virtue is that it has a tendency to benefit younger players with more facile minds than mine. The situation where I would enjoy playing this one is with my 4 year old son. A similar game is Chicken Cha Cha Cha. He tends to do quite well at those kinds of games, despite me trying my best. Its nice to be able to compete with him and for him to enjoy so much success.

Kids Rating. Bought this to play with my 4 year old nephew. It's an interesting memory game for kids and is quite scalable for age and ability by adjusting the number of cards you use. My nephew started with 5 cards and now plays with the full 8 cards and does okay. At 8 cards it's a good challenge for adults too. This is certainly a game I'll suggest to my nephew when he wants to play a game.

RATING: 6
Decent memory game for kids.  Started out playing with 6 cards instead of 8 but the kids are catching on quickly.  One problem we've run into is that the same group of 6-7 cards can remain on the table for quite awhile while the replacement card ends up as the end point for quite a few rounds.  A detraction from an otherwise decent game.  Could increase to 10 - 12 cards to ramp up the difficulty.

Those with good memories might find that it's too easy to play the game perfectly - defeating the purpose of a memory game.  I suppose going up to 10 or 12 cards could solve the problem.  Also, the game can lock into an uninteresting pattern where the same seven cards will stay on the board, with the eighth position changing every turn.  I'm amazed to see no other ratings below six for this junky game.  The whimsical idea of "the fat sack going 'round" is the only thing saving this from a 2 rating.

Still the game is good fun for being what it is, a simple game that you can have fun with the little people.

A memory game in the tradition of Chicken Cha Cha Cha. A bit more simplified, so that all you need is the cards themselves. Probably works great from 4 y.o. up.

We tried it with a 7 y.o. and it was a hit. It is cheap, so there is no excuse not to add it to your next game order. But also it'd be a snap to make from a thrift copy of Memory, just write numbers and arrows on the tiles (or cards.)

The card quality is good and thick, kind of hard to shuffle, but easy to pick up and turn over.

Love it. Recommended if you got kids, or if you're in the mood for a quick, silly memory game. It's tougher than it looks for us old fogeys.

I own the Plumpsack  version in the metal tin.

We played this one with seven people, and it felt like a party game. People were hootin' and hollerin' and carryin' on. I don't know if the Sherlock game would be as fun, but I can't imagine the obscenity of the German version could be the entire reason for our enjoyment.

Rated based on playing with children.  Plumpsack must take its place as one of gaming's great icons.  Kids accept Plumpsack on his own terms, none has questioned what Plumpsack is.  This is a really fun memory game, and can be quite difficult if one is not gifted in that area.  I think that when playing with adults a few more cards are needed to really make it a challenge, but the rules as written are very playable with young children, who tend to do better at memory games anyway.  I found that the game would sometimes get locked into a particular pattern, with the new card triggering the former pattern, which is easy to rattle off after just having done it.  Maybe we played something wrong, but that was one thing that puzzled me.

Would pick up if I had aspiring gamers in the household.

I have the Sherlock, Playroom Entertainment edition. Kids adore this game, and it's one memory game that I think adults can actually hold their own against kids while playing (a rarity, as kids usually stomp all over adults in memory games).

I can't wait to play it against adults!  But I will say this... despite the claim on the box cover, there isn't any deduction involved in this game, it's pure memory.

Kids game where you make a circle of cards like a clock face and play cards down. A memory game then ensues where you have to say what the card is and if correct, you advance to the next space. If you get to a face-up card, you keep it and the next player goes. If wrong, next players' turn.

This is a memory game for pretty young kiddos.

Basic memory game for kids with the slight twist of needing to remember multiple cards in a random sequence.  Maybe works with 3 - 5 y.o.  I got it for my just turned 6 y.o. daughter and she was a bit too old for it.  At that time she would rather play a straight up memory game with, oh, 30 tiles.

RATING: 5
Cute memory game. May be it was just the way cards were laid out in our game but only few cards were ever exchanged and we remembered all 8 cards by the time the game is half done.

There are better memory games with similar aspects - All Tomatoes and Zicke Zacke are both better and more challenging.

My rating is based off adults playing.  Memorizing the cards isn't too difficult.  I don't think this is one adults can play equally with kids.  As a strictly kids playing game, it might rank better.

RATING: 4
If you have to play a memory game, this is at least a decent attempt at making it fun by adding the directional element of where to look next. You're trying to string together a series of recollections. It has the advantage of being able to set the difficulty level to help with your enjoyment (easy being 5 or 6 cards face down, hard being 9 or more). Not really a game to play with adults or gamers though, as the memory element turns it into more like work than fun.

Kids rating - very simple but fun memory game.  It even manages to challenge us adult players sometimes.  The game uses thick cards which is great idea for a kids game as they'll be able to take the abuse.

RATING: 6
Portable, poor man's Chicken Cha Cha in feel without the chasing element, hence Sherlock will never be as exciting as that game. Still Sherlock is fun when the player to the right intentionally picks a card that is difficult to recall, or the increasing pressure as you are forced to move and recall yet another card before you can move to a face up one and claim. One strong tactic (applying a number association system) can be a game breaker, unless you forget that the card has already been taken. So really a good example of how applying such a tactic improves a person's ability.

RATING: N/A
A fun memory game (I never really knew there was such a thing, to be honest). You deal 8 cards face-up in a circle around the draw deck, and you stare at them for 30 seconds to memorize what's where. Each card has an image, a direction arrow (right or left), and a number from 1-4. After you study the cards, they get flipped face down, and the game begins: you take a card showing Sherlock on it and place it next to any card, then you guess what it is. If you're right, you flip it over and move the Sherlock card by the number of spaces clockwise or counterclockwise, as indicated by the card. Then you guess whatever card is in that new location. Repeat. When Sherlock lands on a card that has already been flipped face-up, you collect that card (first to 6 wins) and replace it in the circle. If your guess is ever wrong, your turn ends immediately. Playing games with children has made me more charitable towards memory games in general, as I'm having a pretty good time with this one. I have even played it 2p with my wife (who commented "we should play this as we age" after she beat me), and even played it 3p with my wife and sister. In my opinion, an excellent children's game.

--Dec2005-- Heh.  Quite amusing.  A bit easier on my old head than Chicken Cha-Cha-Cha, but of much the same ilk.  Daughter #1 (almost 6yo) thought it was great fun as she slaughtered the older folk.

My 3 1/2 year old daughter will requests this game of about 30% of the frequency that she requests Hiss, but never finishes the game.  She doesn't really understand the purpose of the game and what an entire turn consists of.  She justs likes guessing what is under each card.  Maybe in a couple years she'll really get it and enjoy the real game.

What is the plumpsack? Shudder.

Own the non-genitalia version: Sherlock.

My 300th game. A milestone.

Mind-bending memory game with a twist: players move the detective according to arrows marked on each card and have to remember the card the detective lands on.

Play with more cards for a harder game. Also, shift the cards round one space to the right or left after every player has gone once to mess with peoples' minds.

The Plumpsack gives a lot of laughs, but beware the Plumpsack for he does not always give cards, and never clues. The Plumpsack is filled with scabs, worn bricks and forgotten dreams. He wants to smack your head with his body, yet you must love the Plumpsack.

Certainly, the best memory game I've played.

My daughter loves this so much we pretty much just play through the deck or until bedtime. For me, it's way better than regular Memory or any themed Memory game Like The Backyardigans Memory Game. Next I'll try the Dragontales Memory game with her.EDIT: For some reason, you couldn't pay her in candy to play this game anymore. I'm still up for it though.EDIT: As of July 1, 2009, I think Lorelei's done with this game. We played right after Leapin' Lilly Pad which she really liked and then we had to quit this one.

Sherlock.  Rated for play with kids.  A fun memory card game to play with the kids, say 6 to 8, although 9 and 10 year olds have fun.  Going to 6 cards can take up to 30 minutes if played with 4 or 5 and the kids are agonizing over their choices.  Rated 8 or 9 for 6 to 8 year olds.  Very high-qaulity cards (as thick as most tiles).  Decent artwork which is perfect for a memory game.  Still prefer Buggo and Chicken Cha Cha Cha with this age group, but this is a nice game to have as a change of pace.  And young kids really do like memory games.  Also, they tend to beat me even though I'm trying, so I can play without throwing the game, which they enjoy.

What a neat little memory game.  I'm not particularly good, but it's really tough since the things you're trying to remember keep changing!  It's a fun, quick card game that would be good to play while waiting for others to arrive (like Coloretto, No Thanks, or For Sale).

Rates a 9 for kids.  My 6 and 10 yo love to play this memory game and it can wreak havoc on adult grey matter as well.  I prefer this game over ANY other memory game for kids.  Sherlock version.

Fun memory game that's not just for kids, folks.  This is Memory on steroids.  It's about as much fun watching others agonize over what a certain card is as it is taking your own turn.  Maybe that's what puts this one over the top for me.  In any event, I'm looking forward to more plays of this.

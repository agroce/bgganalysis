A fun game, but the board was designed with aesthetics over functionality, and it is near impossible to see the links and multiplier connections at a glance.  How hard would it have been to add icons for electricity/river/oil line?  they actually did put (tiny) icons for the train stations.
Annoyed that I will have to probably get paint pens and mark up my board to make it usable.

Disappointing. The core mechanic is good, and I like auction games. But
* The board is way too busy, it is very hard to see all the links and bonuses.
* The game lacks tension and goes on too long.

Had a very bad start in my first game. It seems that the fourth player has a serious disadvantage. More plays will make clear that I'm right or not. So the score could change.
This auctiongame is strange because of the way the money goes around in the game.

An auction game that seems a little too redundant with 60 game auctions and 18 development turns. Then scoring and the game is over.

I wish the column markers were a brighter color. The board is not as attractive as I thought it would be, and it is also confusing . The game took a lot longer than expected. 

End game scoring was easier when one player's connected Bonus Fields and Factories were turned over, scored, and then removed. 

This game will only occasionally make it to the table. All those auctions were just a little exhausting.

I played "Industria" once and enjoyed it. Then I played "Industry" and was disappointed. I don't know if the small changes in the rules affected this, but I found out that missing your opportunity to gain money as the auctioneer can be even more harmful than I had thought. Due to the game structure, if you happen to make a wrong guess and auction an item nobody wants, it may take a long time before you have another opportunity and can go back in the game.

Also, the production and graphic design choices really get in the way of gameplay. The board is atrocious, and it's not even a matter of "form over function", as it's not only much less functional than the original, but also uglier. Besides, the decision to make the game language-independent really hurt the theme, as you have to look up on a separate sheet what each factory is, if you care.

Industry is a lengthy but fairly straight-forward game of resource but mostly money management with a very unusual auction system (one chance to bid with the final player being able to match and win the auction). It is one of the most ruthless Euro games I've played with the indirect effects of losing out on a space being very costly at times - which simply fuels the auction intensity even more. It outstays its welcome by about 15 to 30 minutes as the game lacks strategic long-term planning needed to give it depth (remaining flexible is often more important than committing to a plan). It is still a fascinating game for those looking for something new in auction mechanics.

I played and liked the previous Industria version before. Industry introduces some changes but I don't feel any noticeable improvement. There's more opportunities to buy something worthwhile but if there's any effect than it is that most of the time most players will have less money while one player sits on a big pile of it which makes the auctions less interesting. I'll keep my Industria.

I grabbed this off of a prize table.  Later I was given a copy of Industria.  I had played Industria when it was new game.

Industry is Industria, 2nd ed.

But something went seriously wrong with Industry.  Industria had a lot of German on the board, so the language-neutral Industry should be an improvement.

However, the nice wooden coins from Industria have been replaced with cardboard coins.  

The big ownership/technology/bonus tiles have been eliminated. 

The clear iconography of the Industria board has been revised into icons that I find difficult to read.  I strongly reacted (poorly) to the new look of the game.  It is far less functional.

Worse, the icons used to be on your ownership tiles, but now the only place to see them is on the board.

Both games use cardboard chits to mark ownership.  But the Industria markers were smaller, and conveyed a tiny bit of theme (showing various tool outlines).  The Industry markers are used earlier, marking a factory with a clock symbol to show they have not yet been built, and then flipped over to a blank side when completed.  This last bit isn't deeply disappointing, but it adds little to endear the game to me.

Ruleswise, Industry makes a huge fundamental change from the original game.  In Industria, the auctioneer can refuse to accept a bid from the high bidder, and simply keep the item being auctioned at no expense, merely giving up his right to additional auctions for the round.  This has been changed.  Now, In Industry, the auctioneer must match the high bid, and pay it out to the other players!

There are other rule changes too.  But everything else seemed to be aimed at injecting more money into the game, which is a reasonable thing to do.

It was interesting comparing the two games.  Despite the heavy German text in Industria, I will be keeping that one with preference over the English version called Industry.

Given to a friend.

Played once, 4p.  This is NOT a strongly remade version of Industria.  It IS Industria, with some slight rules tweaks, and a new board.  The board is very pretty, but has some usability issues.  Anyway, I like this game, even though I suck at it.  It has a nice series of technology trees, and an interesting auction mechanic.

The best part of Industry is the auction mechanism. The current auctioneer puts industries on offer and may either take money from the highest bidder or distribute the same amount to all the players and claim the bid item for himself or herself. The industries themselves add another dimension to the game as some produce goods that other players have to buy to upgrade their industries.

However, and as many other reviewers have stated, a brilliant design is ruined by poor art that makes it hard to see which industries are linked and thus earn bonus points. I also have some concerns about this bonus system, since it forces the players to choose whether to focus on their own links, which risks letting an opponent score too much, or bid against said opponent, which benefits the other players more.

Only more plays can tell whether Industry another example of Schacht's brilliant balance act or simply broken.

RATING: 7.5
Effective game of money redistribution, which almost makes it a strategy of timing rather than economics. The tech tree seems to be well-balanced and open to a number of viable strategies, while auctions keep everyone involved and add a tactical note to the long-term strategy. A minimal luck element will appeal to the heavy thinkers. The cluttered board DOES make sense in its prettiness, although the gripes about confusion have some merit. It's a shame the publishers didn't see fit to add the building/technology names, though.

This is a great game that is let down by board graphics that are not very gamer friendly.

Get 10 blue colour stickers to add next to the 10 factories associated with the Ports.  Similarly, use 5 different coloured stickers for each of the other 3 bonus utilities.  This will make it much easier for players to know which factories are associated with which bonus utilities.

Also, at start of play, take 1 cash from the first player and give it to the last player for better game balance.

Simple game with auctioning as the central mechanic. Players bid to own factories, technologies, and bonus tiles on a map through 5 eras. Linked spaces ultimately result in victory points. Resources to develop ("activate") these buildings are aquired via "joker tiles," produced in factories, purchased from other players (like in 7 Wonders), or bought from the bank. 

Never reaches its potential as a game as the technology tree element is not pursued, resulting in a semi-abstract game of connections, money management, and pure auctioning (the bright spot of the game).

This is a deep game that basically is just auction after auction.  Very unique auction mechanic which really puts you in a difficult decision each round.  Money is supper tight.  The other good thing going for this game is that is relatively easy to learn and has good player interaction and a pretty involved and complicated end of game point system. The down side, at least with three, we seemed to get into a pattern of bidding dependent on which position we were to the auctioneer.  Not sure it this a has staying power but it was it was fun for the first play.

This game mostly works, but it has several key blocking issues
(1) the graphics on the board are bad.  Not just annoying, but so bad that they interfere with play.  Figuring out how many points a property is worth is already a mildly annoying arithmetic problem, made vastly worse by information representation on the board.  Important information is subtle and background art is cluttered and overt.

(2) the game engine itself is a straight forward auction of stuff worth variable points depending on what else you know.  Not inspired but functional.  However, the rules for when the auctioneer role changes, and the order in which production buildings come out (vs. buildings requiring the resources they produce) add a lot of randomness.  Those uncertainties overwhelm the otherwise subtle factors that affect the values of properties.

(3) there is nothing new here.  The game is a mash up of standard euro mechanics stuck together in an uninspired manner -- there are not weird emergent dynamics, just sets of rules crudely jammed together.

All in all, a subtle and elegant game engine has been ruined by luck + bad graphics + lack of originality.

Classic Ystari-style game with continuous VP scoring and endless bidding (60 bidding phases).

RATING: 8
Wow, I have to disagree with a lot of people here... this game is quite good.

Yes, the board is not the most conducive for gameplay in terms of determining how buildings are linked, but it's nowhere near the disaster as people seem to make it out as being... in fact, no one even commented on problems with the graphics whatsoever during our games.

The rulebook is clear and well-written - we didn't have to check a FAQ to clarify any further details - and the core mechanics are simple yet involve all the players each turn and offer many tough decisions.

Money is tight - perhaps too tight - but that tightness fuels the tension. This may upset some as you never feel like you have enough to do what you want to do, but I love games where I feel like I am just constantly drowning and fighting to keep my head above water (like most co-ops).

Only complaint is the game is slightly long for its simple mechanics. Still, a very good game.

[b]UPDATE: (11/2016)[/b] Increased my score from a 7.5 to an 8. This game has been hitting the table fairly often, demonstrating its staying power. This is probably one of the most underrated games I own - the BGG rank should be in the top 1000 rather than in the 3000-4000 range.

£4.99 from The Works.

On initial reading of the rules and solo run through, seem like an interesting auction type game.

Have to agree with most of the comments that the board layout is horrendous. But I'm not sure how that could ever be improved much due to the various links the roads, river, rail etc make with the factories.

Hence the crib sheet included highlighting the road/technology links, and showing names of factories and their links to rail, river, power and pipelines.

Can also see games dragging as play becomes over analytical as the game progresses.

This is clearly a case in where aesthetics doesn't serve its purpose. My main complaint about Industry has to do with the components and the way everything is fiddly and confusing. Maybe after 5 or 6 games everything becomes intuitive and clear but in the meanwhile the board, money and tokens are a mess.

I've already played Industria once before and liked the idea. Industry keeps some of the good things although it altered the auction a bit. I'm not sure if it works better because I've only played each game once. I guess that players tend to get some money from their firsts auctions in the round in order to buy the final and really desired place.

Bonus tokens are fiddly and don't seem necessary. Chips are a very powerful resource, maybe too powerful. Tallying points at the end is painful as the graphics are although very beautiful, also hugely confusing.

As a non fan of auction games, Industry kept my attention because of Industria but even being in a much more friendly language (English instead of German) I still find this one much more complicated to read than the previous. And how unnecessary that is!

PS: the price of the game considering its components is completely out of reality.

Single play. I've always enjoyed [gameid=8124], so a re-implementation is bound to require some getting used to.

Three initial observations compared to Industria:

The auction change seemed to generate some odd bids since auctioneer now pays for the tile he takes, matching the highest bid and distributing coins around players. Maybe simply 'different' rather than better or worse. No strong opinion.

The components feel much reduced in cost, while simultaneously losing usability. Consider bonus tiles/locations. Applicable bonuses used to be printed on the factory tile being auctioned. Now you have to trace lines on the board to see applicable bonuses (& the 3D effect hinders this when viewing the board upside down). The little icons actually turn out harder to use than the German words on the original board!

UK MSRP of £49.99 makes it a strong entry for the 2010 comedy pricing awards.

Box cover is attractive but box is too big for what is inside. Artwork is attractive but it could have been clearer which factories are linked however I don't think it is as unclear as some say. Also the player tokens do not fit in with the board, and it would have been handy to have a marker for the different resources which the producing player could have to indicate their ownership. Likewise with the game, basically it is a set collecting game via auctions, but it is not as bad as some say. It takes too long to play for what it is. I would be happy to play again but there is something missing, not sure what but something is needed for it to be a good game in my books.  I also think it could be a card game - maybe that would make it better.

Wits and Wagers game prize from Dice Tower Con 2014.

12-3-14: Finally got a chance to break this out the other day and it was as fun as I had expected it to be. I think this will play even better with a larger group. Rating is based on playing this after 10 pm with the right group.

Dang color blind problem - but I want to like this game. I still play it - even though I'm terrible at it. It's more of a pure family/kids game in every way. Frantic, grabby, speedy fun. So I like it even though the color problem hampers a full experience.

It's French and involves fast reactions and attention to detail.  This is the game to play with someone who generally doesn't like board games.  Can't say there's much incentive to play it other than as a party game, or if you have kids, in which case this will be a hit and is highly recommended.

Basically Egyptian Rat Slap with a totem instead of slapping.  This makes it easier on your hands, though you can still scratch each other up if you're competitive and don't trim your nails.  The symbols are fun and similar enough that it's hard to tell them apart at a moment's glance, leading to hilarious mix-ups and mistaken grabs.  Great small party game.

Apparently I have some weird unique version in which the outward-pointing-arrows card is replaced by a Raving Rabbids card, but it is NOT the Raving Rabbids version of the game.  The only difference from regular JS is this one card, which lets the person who flipped it place the totem somewhere on the table while everyone else closes their eyes and then tries to find it blind.  Can't find any information on this version anywhere, let me know!

Pros
- Hilarious game. Creates laughter.
- People screw up and you laugh at their stupid faces
- Cards are so similar sometimes it's crazy
- Faking people out by reaching for the totem
- Tug of War'ing with the totem against another person
- The fear you get when you're on your last card waiting to grab the totem
- Plays up to 8 people really well

Con

A fun little speed game.  There's not a whole lot to it, but you're kept on your toes the whole time.  It reminds me of ERS, which I enjoyed immensely throughout college...this game would fit that group very well.  It gets more and more chaotic with more players.  I really do like the similar symbols, they make the game all the more intense.  The two-player two-hand variant is very good as well.

Mostly wanted to try the totem-in-another-room variant. You need more than one entrance to the other room, I think; my attempt didn't go too well. It's not a bad game, but unless you're playing that variant, Egyptian Rat Screw will scratch the same itch and is arguably less random. Then again, it's a lot harder to take Jungle Speed as seriously, which is good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I hate this game. I don't like its principle (quick reflexes don't agree with me), and I don't understand the point in catching the Totem, except having your hands scratched by other players. Not for me. No, thanks!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
To be honest, I was surprised at how much fun this game can be. With the right group, the game is incredibly engaging and tense with each move. Sometimes players grab the totem at the wrong time and other times someone may break a nail on another player... it can be THAT tense of a game (Seriously, nails are bad in this game).

That being said, mechanically the game isn't as refined as it should be. Most of the game-rules issues have to do with the arrow cards in the game (especially the match color card). This creates a lot of ambiguity and additional questions in the game. Fortunately, these situations are rare. Unfortunately, these additional rules are quite distracting from the game and explains why people often play the game incorrectly or with some variant/house rule. I thought about taking out the arrow-cards to play this game, but honestly... they add a lot to the game and really make the game much more engaging.

In general speed games are not my cup of tea.  However there's just something about this game that gives me flashbacks of playing Spoons as a teenager.  We laughed a lot during this game and it made for a very enjoyable experience (almost like a party game.)  It bears a very strong resemblance to Snorta, which is a game we enjoy a lot.  However it drops the memory element from Snorta, so it works better for certain players who struggle with memory mechanisms in games.

The big problem I had with the game was some ambiguity in the rules.  After getting some clarification from other BGG users I tried the game again.  Still this game seems like a game that's just missing a little something.  If not for the memory element I would say that Snorta is easily the better game.  I feel this way because grabbing for the same object can create injuries and some nasty battles.  It's just not something I look for in games.  I don't hate this game, but it will only be brought out in select situations.

A speed game where you're trying to match patterns on cards and be the first grab a rubber totem. It'd better be a match though. Otherwise you end up with everyone's cards. The art is deliberately deceptive.

The tension can be sublime as stakes increase and increase and then you grab for the stick. Bring Band-Aids and nail clippers. Your knuckles and ego may end up bruised. 

Think outside the box. Place the totem in another room.

Simply put, this isn’t my kind of game. I’m as unattracted as hopeless at dexterity and reaction games, so I can’t share the same enjoyment my friends openly show when playing Jungle Speed: to me, it looks more like a medical examination than a game and especially it reminds those boring sight tests you take to get or extend your driving license.

As far as the reaction-based games go, I find Geistesblitz much more fun, enjoyable and challenging than this one.

[b]Update[/b] - After having been forced to play it again and again over the good last year, I’ve started to dislike Jungle Speed even more than I used to: I think that 3 is a more fitting rating than the 5 I gave it at first.

Wow! If I had to apply the phrase "pure game" to one title, this is probably it. At the moment when two shapes match, be the first to grab the totem. That's the game. Speed, coordination, and correct judgment are all equally important. Your hand must be quick, and sure, at the right time.

Ugh, I'm not sure I'd call this a game ... there isn't really any decision making, and certainly no 'strategy', just flip cards and hope you are fast enough and pattern recognition and grabbing the totem. Doesn't help I'm colour blind, which you'd think wouldn't really matter but it does - no 2 cards have the same colour/shape combination, but I can't differentiate between some of the colours so for me the cards *do* have the same colour/shape combinations making the pattern spotting a bit harder.

After playing this I felt an unpleasant mix of frustration and boredom, not what I want from a 'game' at all!

Might play it with children, definitely never again with only adults.

Juego de rapidez, agilidad propicio para fiestas y encuentros entre gente joven. No es un juego de mesa al uso, aunque utiliza cartas. Tiene una serie de reglas que determinan quien debe coger un token central. Es fácil resultar (levemente) lesionado si juegas con alguien con experiencia y un poco bruto. Es divertido, aunque no es mi tipo de juego.

Uno de los clásicos para las reuniones de amigos, nunca falla. Unas cervezas y luchar por coger un palo combinando reflejos y estar atento a los detalles. Idealmente lo mejor es jugar 4-5 y saber que existe riesgo de arañazos, golpes y ataques de risa. Cuando se juega con novatos la típica pregunta de por qué no son iguales dos cartas y ver su reacción al captar la sutil diferencia no tiene precio. Le tengo especial cariño porque es uno de los juegos que me descubrió que había cosas más allá de Risk,  Monopolio, Trivial o Party.

It is indeed fun to grab the totem, fun to miss the grab, and fun to see someone else grab it at the wrong time. This game involves a lot of laughing.

However, because of the nature of losing and winning cards in cycles, the game can go back and forth, back and forth, overstaying it's welcome.

Also, it is very similar to a game that can be played with a standard deck of cards, so it is retreading familiar ground from my childhood.

I love Jungle Speed! It's very fast to play and people always seem to want more! Never played a game of Jungle Speed in which we stopped after a single game, which I think says it all. It's a pure frantic, chaotic game and it's always great fun when somebody grabs the totem when he/she wasn't supposed to grab it.

I own the wooden totem edition, which I think is superior to the plastic totem edition, but either way, this is a must-have game if you like dexterity and pattern recognition games! Great fun to play every single time!

The King of the reaction time games. I rate this so highly because I've been playing it for years and it was an integral part of my work at a boarding school for academically talented high school students.

I do not like speed-based visual-accuity games - that is a combination that I do not excel at under any circumstances.  This is one that is definitely not on my favorites list, and will only get played on the insistence of my daughter (as a doting father is wont to do at times).  I love my daughter, but hate this game, and probably enjoyed "Pretty Pretty Princess" more back when she was younger.

Rated "7" after one play. Fun and silly filler that offers a nice change of pace. Flip over abstract patterns, and race to grab the totem in the middle when two patterns match. It was pretty funny to see the periodic arm twitches. 

At first, I was a bit bummed to see the cheapo plastic totem... until we watched it fly across the room. If earlier versions included a wood totem, there's actually wisdom in using a material in a later version that won't do any heavy damage!

I could see where this game would play well with children.

Update: Well, a year went by, and I didn't play this. And, I've found other light games that work well as a nongamer group. I didn't see this getting any play, and so off it went in a trade.

Update: a few more plays... this isn't a game for every occasion, but one match on a picnic blanket produced a scratched/bloody knuckle. I gotta give the game some kudos for violent game play!

This simple action game is definitely not for the color-blind and not for people who've left their corrective eyewear at home!  Players have to grab the wooden thingie at the center first when they pull cards from the draw pile that match one of the cards in front of other players.  It's all right as an action/party game, but a modest deck of cards and more standard Speed rules would do the trick as well.

Fun little non-strategy, quick reflex, shape matching, party game.  Very simple rules that allow just about any non-gamer to jump right in.  It has potential for injury...which is all part of the appeal and fun factor.  Great for the young and young at heart.

The box says it plays up to 80 people; the rules say up to 15 (what's with that?).  I have found five to eight is best/my preference.  (I would like to get the expansion just for the fact that it will help the game support a higher number of players, as well as adding some slight complexity.)

I knew I wouldn't like this. I'm not a fan of speed games. I also don't really care for the fact that it's a visual speed/recognition game, and they intentionally made  the cards similar, so you have to be super careful about distinguishing what is what. I would play this again maybe with a group of people who are unlikely to play a normal game, but I would prefer to not play this with people capable and willing to play a real game. It also takes longer than it should for something this shallow.

More violent than Set, and a different type of pattern-matching, but has definite similarities.  Doesn't come out as much because it doesn't have the easy drop in/out of Set, and because some people are scared to risk losing a bit of blood or flesh.

Components: Plain, square cards. The designs are unusual and very tricky. Hefty wooden totem.

Experience: Fast and fun. The similarities in the card patterns cause many erroneous grabs, which adds to the fun. A game doesn't take too long, despite having to wait until one player has depleted their cards.

To begin with, there were a silly number of false grabs - grabbing for pattern mismatches, grabbing when other folks' patterns matched and the laughing policeman misgrabbing thrice by thinking the 'arrows outward' card was an 'arrows inward' one.

Rarely did anyone have more than one face-up card in front of them and only towards the end did we start going a while without making a mistake, resulting in folk with 2 or 3 cards.

The violent aspect of the game was beginning to emerge though, as the totem twice hit Robert. I should have noted the 'no dropping' rule at the start.

By the end, Ian, Dave and Dave all looked likely to win and Dave took it. Well, technically he only finished his draw pile. I didn't have the heart to mention the 'finish your face-up pile' rule, since everyone was visibly itching to move onto something heavier.

The difficulty in matching patterns makes it a game more about quick thinking and less about pure reactions than Snap.

There's no downtime - you really need to pay attention on others' turns and there's a constant sense of anticipation.

The one potential issue is the chance of a never-ending game and the variable length.

If others were enjoying this, I could easily imagine myself wanting to play 3 or 4 games in a row. 

2009-08-11
At London NG5, this was a smash hit. Nearly everyone loved it (one person was too drunk to understand the rules) and I feel like I would love playing this nearly anytime.

Observations:
 - it's easier to win a duel when another person flips it over - you only have to check for one shape, they need to check for every other.

 - the bigger the group, the harder it is when it's your turn.

 - The bigger the group, the easier to fake out folk.

 - shouting 'snap' worked well initially...

 - The easiest way to lose is simply lack of attention. You really need to constantly focus.

 - When it's your turn, it's good to watch out for the pattern of the person(s) with the largest pile, since it's usually too hard to look out for everything.

RATING: 8
Quite possibly one of the best party games ever.  Every time I have brought this out, people have enjoyed watching it be played, and then asked to join in the next game.

Quick thinking and quicker hands are required to win.  

Note:  Make sure everyone's nail's are cut short.  This is the only boardgame that I have received an injury from playing.  Did it stop me?  No way.  My band-aid and I proceeded to win that match!

+ It’s quick, fun and intense. This game is easy to teach, easy to set up, and easy to play. I love the reaction of the first mistake made in the game, where the player looks in awe trying to figure out if it really wasn’t a match. The look is priceless.
- This game can get brutal, especially if you are playing with people who have long nails. A friend of mine had to sit out because his hand was bleeding from having a player rip the totem from his hand. Also, there are chances when cards can get lost. I think I’m down to 78 cards now and I have no clue where the other two could’ve gone.

Jungle Speed is a clever twist on the American reflex-based card game "Rat Screw". The designers added a wooden dowel to grab (minimizes bloody fingers) and added another visual element element: so many cards look alike! Addictive, fun, laugh-out-loud party game. Hightly recommended, especially for non-gamers and for relatives.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) A fairly standard pattern-recognition speed game, with the only major twist being that, instead of slapping a card, you have to be the first to grab the totem sitting in the middle of the table. This can frequently result in injury, as I have found out to my disadvantage.

Jungle Speed feels like an expanded party game version of Egyptian Ratscrew. It requires pattern recognition, fast reflexes, and a willingness to suffer physical pain and injury from fighting with other players for the totem. In a nutshell, it's everything you could want in a party game. It really needs at least 4 players and preferably 5 or 6 to get the most fun out of the game, but if you have a larger group it can be a blast.

This has become a huge favorite when my gang of non-gaming adult friends get together. Put your favorite bottle on the table and this leads to hours of hyper-active fun. Make sure everyone clips their fingernails though -- I bear at least one scar from this game!

RATING: 6
Based on 4 plays.
+ It's an ok way to spend some time.
> One player used to grab the totem with such a force that other players did not even try to complete: they tried to always dodge the swinging hand.
- There is a chance that the game goes on and on indefinitely, which is bad for a light game like this.

Something about the cards just didn't compute with me. I prefer other fast-observation games such as Ghost Blitz. Still, I'd be game to try the highly-physical variant where the totem is place in another room, though one or more of the players would inevitably end up in the hospital...

I quite enjoy a speed game on occasion, so I don't go out of my way to avoid this one, but it is a little frustrating for a party game because the cards are intentionally made to be confusing. 

There's a little bit of a learning curve (which party games shouldn't have too much of) and as all speed games are, the one who has had the most practice/is most familiar with the cards (i.e. owns the game) wins.

This is a great pattern-recognition, quick-reflex party game that can support almost any number of players (it says 100 on the box).  Theoretically, a game could last forever, but for the most part, they're pretty quick affairs.  Playing with opponents that have long fingernails could result in significant pain and blood.

Fun but very simple speed game. Most of the fun comes from the very similar-looking illustrations but after some play you're able to spot the small details and the fun is somehow diluted. Also, this is the kind of game that can be shamelessly dominated by a single player, making it uninteresting for the others (and for him).

Great game for quick play with a bunch of friends.  Comes in a small bag that's easy to carry and the game is easy to learn.  

Once everyone knows how to play, it's simple enough to get a game going.  The large cards make it easy to see the patterns, but the devious patterns keep people guessing.

The wooden totem has a good heft to it, and is sturdy enough for repeated tug of war battles.

Intelligent Snap for adults and kids. The cards and rules are such that your brain is just slightly overloaded, so you can become trigger happy and grab the totem when you shouldn't. Enjoyable nonsense, despite the fact I have a dud totem (rating 7) (25/8/10). Ok game, just the damaged cause by fingernails makes me more reluctant to suggest it (re-rating 6) (26/6/11) UPDATE: Recent 5 player game reminded me this is a really fun game, an deserves a better rating (7.372, Feb 16)

I have actually wanted to try Jungle Speed for awhile, so why not! It was what I assumed: pattern recognition and motor speed. Played fine for just that, though I found the "special card" rules a bit hard to keep in mind the first few times around. I was getting it by the end, but my brain maybe wasn't totally on for making the best of this game. And bested by a 10-year-old. Egad!

RATING: 7
Reaction and visual recognition game that's similar to Halli Galli, Snap, and Egyptian Ratscrew - but better than any of those. Players take turns flipping a card onto the top of their personal stack. When two players' cards match in either shape or color, they compete to grab the baton in the center of the table. There are some other complications, but that's the basic idea.

Jungle Speed is a very simple, straightforward game. It works best in conjunction with alcohol, sleep deprivation, or children. Avoid playing against those with bloodborne illnesses.

In high school and early college I played quite a bit of Egyptian Ratscrew. It was a fun game of pattern recognition and quick reflexes. Jungle Speed should have been right up my alley as it is clearly in that family of games.

But I really don't care for it. Egyptian Ratscrew works because you use a standard set of playing cards, with which everyone playing should be familiar. Jungle Speed uses a unique set of cards featuring very similar patterns. The idea is that the patterns will trick you, and they will at first. However, this then becomes one of those games that greatly benefits those who play it the most.

Another problem with the game is setting up the optimal play environment. An optimal environment requires not only the obvious arm's length from the totem in the center but also an arrangement such that everyone can easily see everyone else's played cards without having to crane their necks. Definitely a game in which groups need either a circular table or the floor - which is problematic if you do not have one and people (for various reasons) cannot sit on the other.

Basically multiplayer Snap, but everyone has separate piles of cards and you grab a stick, instead of slapping cards. Matching cards is difficult as the shapes on the cards are deceptively similar and there are some special cards that add some variety into the mix. Raucous fun.

Fun party game, though not quite as much chaos as I would like and it can really drag if people don't get into the spirit of it (there's a reason it's called Jungle [b]Speed[/b], people!).  Most of the games I've played have been lost by a new player constantly breaking the rules, allowing one person to completely empty their deck in short order.  I imagine with a group of experienced players going at breakneck speed this game would live up to its potential.

This was a real blast.  Consider it a pretty solid Egyptian Rat Screw.

It's all about speed and pattern recognition.  The cards are deviously designed.

The "special" cards seem like a complete bust.  In particular, the interactions of color match and all play are so messy the FAQ can barely solve it.  It's a bloody mess.  I tried a couple games with them and just dumped them.

I love reaction games and I am good at this one, too. I love grabbing the pole in the middle, what a nice little twist to ringing a bell or sth similar. The similarity of the cards is tough to figure out even after a few rounds. The tension has some bumps during the game though when you play it with higher player counts.

A fun, quick game. Not as much of a thinker as Citidels, but a lot like speed, the card game. Actually, I think I prefer speed, because with jungle speed you can have moments where nothing is going on, and if something does go on it is only 1 thing. After that one thing there is a small break before players flip new cards over, whereas in normal speed you have to be on your toes because the game does not pause after one move, it can keep going. Nice game, but prefer normal speed. The only advantage is the multiplayer option with Jungle speed. Be advised, everyone I have played this with likes the game a lot more then me, so you probably will, too.

Not bad, but this caused confusion in a non fun way. Also it was a bit too easy for a few bad players to enable someone to win quickly. Though I guess that can a problem with all speed games, this one seemed to suffer more from it because the contests were limited and all too likely the best players would not face each other.

This is a fun diversion but nothing too serious. Great as a somewhat mindless filler between heavier games and it gets your blood going too.  I LOVE the 2-player verion where each player is dealt two hands, one for his left hand and one for the right, each time you grab for the totem you need to use the CORRECT hand! Very fun...

At last I got to play this infamous game. I really liked it. It is a reflexes and pattern recognition game, I often have very good reflexes, but as many cards are very similar I made a lot of mistakes in the pattern recognition department :D. I would never say no to a game of Jungle Speed.  It is uber simple, easy to explain and fast to play.

Perhaps I will buy it again, it all depends if I can find sleeves for the cards. Also it is very similar to Ghost Blitz, a game I prefer to play (for now).

This is a great filler. On your turn, flip a card, if the shape matches the shape in front of anyone else, grab the baton before they do. If you do, they take your discard pile into their draw pile, If they beat you, you take theirs. First one to run out of cards wins. It's worth a surprising amount of fun and laughter.

One of my favorites and most requested out of all the games I have. In fact I have given this as gifts and bought it for probably 5 people so far. 

Side note: After I gave this as a gift, someone informed me that I was playing with the rules all wrong.  He said you have to pick up your pile along with the other person's when you lose.  Also, color arrows stay effective until covered or there's an action.  This was news to me.  I went to check my rules and I WAS playing by the rules I had - his (the newer version) were different!

A fun dexterity game where you flip over cards with various shapes on them and when there is a match, a duel ensues!  You have a little wooden (or plastic) handle in the middle of the table.

Combines perception with a quick hand!

This didn't impress me at first glance, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Bad reflexes and dexterity didn't hinder my enjoyment of the game. Just make sure nobody has any finger jewelry on and everyone's nails are cut!

Para echarse unas risas y amenizar las sobremesas. Para jugarlo en plan familiar. Tiene el inconveniente de poder hacerse pupa en la encarnizada lucha por coger el tótem.

RATING: 6
All fun and games until someone gets hit in the face by a flying totem. Replace the wooden totem with something equally consistent, so that it won't be torn apart, yet with a bigger base and softer, such as a rubber duck. Seriously. Do it.

Concussive projectiles aside, the game is fun. I don't like it that much, but it's a personal preference, as I favour creative party games over dexterity-based ones.

A modern day take on the classic spoons game, or so I have heard (haven't played spoons).  Easy to play and teach, and can be utter hilarity with the right crowd.  SUSD mentioned playing with the totem in another room and dashing into the room to claim it, I have to try that.

This is a fast-paced shape recognition game based on quick reactions.  In a way, it's almost a variant of Slap Jack, except that it features its own weird shapes, and there are active piles in front of all players.  There are also a few key rule-changing cards.  The game certainly has its fans, and it has some of the addictive quality of Set, where people will want to play additional games.  The endgame can be a little weak, degenerating to a wait for one type of special card, and it certainly favors the experienced and alert.

A fun dexterity game that I enjoy every now and again.  Some people have they're own house rules or variants and all are generally good.  From experience, I think I should wear an atheletic cup support, flak jacket and football helmet when others are going for the Totem - one time, it flew off someone's hands and almost hits me in the . . . . ahhh, nuts! :D  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Match images quickly and be the first to grab the totem.  Pattern recognition and quick hand-eye coordination will win you this game...otherwise, its quite the excercise in futility!  Fun for a change of pace and it plays very quickly.  The special card with 4 of the same color arrows pointing inward has become defined as "Larry's card" since I always manage to win it...:-)

I mixed some of the cards from the expanion into my copy of the original and took some of the original cards out. The set I play with now has cards from both that most resemble each other. This set limits the general style of cards to about four, but makes each of those four much more specific.

RATING: 9
This is a great game that I can play over and over again. It's kind of like spoons, but there's much more action involved and a couple more fun rules. The only downside at all is that it doesn't expand all that well. Whereas with a game like spoons where you can have as many as cards you have/the table can accommodate, more than 8 people is rough, and I'd really prefer 4-6. The up-side, however, is that each round, though less satisfying, is actually shorter with more people because each person will have fewer cards and therefore fewer turns required to win

Este es un juego social, en donde la atención y la rapidez mental hacen parte fundamental para ganar. La dinámica en que se desenvuelve  es parecida al mano-ton. Los jugadores que al revelar sus cartas encuentran que tienen el mismo color o figura deben tratar de agarrar primero la figura, de lo contrario se llevaran todas las cartas. Cave anotar que el objetivo es quedarse sin cartas.

RATING: 6
Jungle Speed is a solid dexterity game -- it's brutal. With an energetic group, it's easy for someone to wind up getting scratched or bruised going for the totem. It's at its best when you can cut the tension in the room with a knife, and this is one tense game.

I love that the designers deliberately made the cards as confusingly similar as possible; it's a great dick move, and somehow very French. It's also the thing that tends to mess me up the most when we play (in a good way).

The biggest disadvantage of [thing=15712][/thing], that it tends to disintegrate any given deck of cards quickly, so I've looked for an sturdier alternative. The totem looked like a good idea, as it's hard to tear apart, but the game somehow too dry compared to it's predecessor. Not counting the aesthetic value it doesn't add anything, and lacks the tension.

My experience with this game is really high, but i found a really huge problem with it, and it is the fact that is almost impossible to have fun playing with it only 2 players. Even when it has special rules, it is not fun for me and my girlfriend to play just both. But when the numbers of players is +4, this game is crazy fun.

Directement inspiré du jeu de carte pour enfant appelé «le cri des animaux », Jungle Speed en reprend les mêmes mécanismes à destination des plus grands.

Chaque joueur possédant en face de lui une pioche face cachée, va devoir retourner rapidement la première carte de celle-ci pour la rendre visible à tous.

Oui je sais ça se ressemble! Mais c'est pas la même carte ! Lache le Totem ! Lache !

Sur ces cartes apparaissent des motifs géométriques colorés et étranges venus d'ailleurs.

Dès que deux joueurs s'aperçoivent qu'ils ont devant eux le même signe, ils doivent se saisir d'un «bitoniau» en bois (nommé Totem par les gourous créateurs) situé au centre de la table de jeu.
Celui qui a été le plus preste donne les cartes qu'il a déjà joué au perdant.

Game in a Nutshell: Lay down cards, be first to grab the totem if you see a match.

Played as: 5 player

Pros: It was a good idea to have a solid totem to grab during the chaos to decrease the likelihood of card destruction. Using patterns on the cards is a nice change-up. They've done a good job of making those patterns look pretty similar but not exactly as to really require a keen focus to see a true match.

Cons: It's a game where you either got it or you don't. If you got it, great! If you don't, it will likely be a very frustrating experience of grabbing totems when you shouldn't; and having others do it at the right time when you are just getting started trying to distinguish what was just flipped.

Other: For a broader group of people this game deserves a better rating than I've given it as it really is a solidly built "speed" activity. But, it's a love it / hate it experience and I'm firmly part of the latter.

Best Use: A speed game that will stand up to the abuse.

Easy-to-play dexterity game that is almost a classic nowadays. A must-have in every game collection, even if it's just for playing with non-gamers.

PROS
- A lot of people know this game, so it may act as a gateway to slightly more complex ones
- EVERYONE can play this, including your granny

CONS
- As in every dexterity game, good players can ruin the fun
- Repetitive as every game is basically the same
- Physical injuries are prone to appear while playing... not kidding

A great dexterity party game, ideal for 3-10 people. I’ve had tons of laughs with the absurd and, frankly, sometimes dangerous situations that arose. Very easy to explain, very addictive as you want to play again and again. Kids love it. Just make sure you remove all drinks from the table :P

RATING: 7
If you’re looking for a dexterity game that’s exciting, fast and fun then you should give Jungle Speed a try. Players are distributed a stack of cards and a totem is placed in the middle of the table. The object of the game is to get rid of your stack of cards. On a player’s turn, a card is flipped over from the top card from his/her stack. If the shape (or color) matches that of any other player’s flipped cards the players must try and seize the totem as quickly as possible. The first player to do so wins and the other player must take the winner’s revealed cards. 

The game itself is simple and easy to explain. There are a few more twists and turns in the rules that make the game interesting and more fun. Much in the vein of Pit, the game plays fast and sometimes furious. No deep strategies or brain burning decisions, just quick reflexes and lots of player interaction. Perfect for a filler or party games! Very light and plays fast. Recommended!

-Simplicity
-Funny moments (people in hurt, mistakes, slow...)
-Pretty well known

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Boring end game
-Player elimination

This game is really funny, just the fact you can crash your hands at each other. Or when you accidentally grab the totem when you shouldn't. Or how about the the moment people are waiting for a second to make sure it's not the same symbol, and than only later realise it acutally is. It's also really simple to explain.

It does have it's problems though. Early game, you sometimes just have people who are naturally really good at this game and can ruin the fun for others, since they practically can do nothing until that person is out of the game. Which brings me to the late game problems: firstly, this game has player elimination (for winning!) Secondly, it's quite boring seeing just 2 people fighting (sometimes endlessly) to get rid of the last few cards. 

There are also no amazing moves someone can do compared to other dexterity (like "what an amazing building" in stacking games or "what a great shot" in flicking ones). Here it's just "wow, you were fast", which is also usually the same person every time, so not so surprising.

Comment on "Owned": my sister owns this. Damn her I want to put this game next to my other games!

RATING: 8
Fun matching game.  The cards have VERY similar shapes.  If you turn up a shape that's the same as someone else's then you race to be the first one to pick up the totem.  Of course you're punished if you're wrong.

Fun and quick.  Supports a large number of players.

RATING: 7
This is my rating for the physical copy of the game, my rating for the wii version would probably be a 7, maybe an 8. 

Jungle Speed is a game where everyone has a stack of cards with lots of different shapes in different colors.  When two of the same exact shapes are showing the two players that own them need to quickly make a move to grab the totem in the middle of the table.  Watch your valuables and your bones, you could get hurt!  Also watch those shapes very intently, they look very much alike even when they are not on purpose so you go grabbing the totem when you were not supposed to!  Some special cards are also added in for more variation, such as the all grab, when you see it, it's anyone's totem!

I do like this game, but it can be too physical and too reliant on quick reflexes, which is fun for some, aggravating for others.

The name says it all - Jungle Speed is about having quick reflexes as players uncover cards turn after turn that have different colours and suspiciously similar but only seldom repeating symbols, waiting for one of these repetitions to grab a stick ("totem") standing on the centre of the table.

Of course, the game achieves its aim - it should be played at a brisk pace to raise the adrenalin rush.

A party game where the first to grab the 6 inch high 'Arriba' stick in the middle of the table when either an Arriba card is turned up (each player blind draws from their own face down deck in turn) or when a shape is drawn that matches another on the table, gets to get rid of some of their cards. First to get rid of their cards wins. There are lots of similar looking shapes which lead to false snatches, especially when some dorko is going 'quick, quick' and 'Arriba, Arriba' all the time. 

Patterns, speed and hurt fingers. Gaming's moved on from here.

Fun, Fast, and Furious card game for 2 to 8 players. I think of it as a cross between the card games War and Set.

Rules a bit fiddly until everyone get them down. Helps to learn this by watching a  few videos.

Bought it as a present for an 8-year old. I found it extremely stylish, thoubht that the totem works perfectly for speed catching and in the videos I saw, everybody seemed to have the time of their lives.

So I sat down with a group of kids to play and my God! How extremely boring and dry. Hated it and felt ashamed for my gift. 

Why did they ever think  that finding matching cards, with symbols that look more or less the same is any fun at all? And the thing that each player has it's own deck makes the game frastrating and unplayable. 

I can't explain to you how stupid I felt when we were drafting cards one after another that didn't match and everyone was thinking "Why the hell are wa doing this thing". Every card should matter. the matching cards mechanic killed all the fun.

Instead I bought Geistesblitz (Ghost Blitz) for myself and I am glad about it. The colours-object thing works great and there is just one card for everyone to play with.

Keep away. Invest on the naughty ghost!

Fun, fun, fun.  As long as the group is willing to be a bit silly, this is a blast to play.  If your group can only be serious/solemn, forget it.  Our kids love this, and the teasing that goes on when anyone has to take a huge stack of cards is merciless.  This is another game like Gulo Gulo where the entire family (well, almost....Gulo Gulo actually allows even younger kids to be extremely competitive) can play and be on equal footing.  I've lost far, far more games of Jungle Speed than I've won.

A simple recognition and reaction game that's great with a group of 5-8 people. I like it a little better than the similar Halli Galli (Extreme). It's not without its flaws, though: the differences between some of the symbols are so subtle, that a new player who hasn't seen all the variations yet will make a lot of mistakes (more than those with a few plays under their belt), so it's not as easy to get into as you might expect. Also, the person flipping their card has a significant disadvantage; not only do they see their card a fraction later, but they have to compare it to all other cards on the table, whereas the others only have to compare it to their own card. Furthermore, you pretty much have to stop and start a new game once you get down to three players; there are too many cards, and it takes to long to continue. And lastly, players will lose some skin to fingernails, and you need to keep drinks and fragile things not only off the table, but preferably in some other room, or accidents will happen.

Still, for a party game, not a bad one.

Delightful.  Exciting, short, and hilarious even when you screw up horribly.  Small enough to stuff into a bag and carry with you anywhere.

RATING: N/A
$1.99 @ GW, missing one card with one bent one.

Rules clarifications:
* - extra cards are placed under the totem at the beginning of the game
1) Color Match is active for as long as at least one player has a color match card showing on the top of their stack. The instant the last Color Match card is covered, matching goes back to symbols.

2) All-Flip situations:
• If one or more Color Match cards come up, then duels are on color for that All-Flip round, and a symbol match is a mistake.
• If a Fast-Grab comes up, then anyone may grab the totem as per normal Fast-Grab rules.
• If an All-Flip comes up, it is only played if there are no duels possible.

3) If multiple players lose a duel, the winner not only decides the card distribution, but also which of the losers starts the next round.

4) A player that makes a mistake starts the next round. (Reaching for but losing grip on the totem is not considered a mistake)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty much a game of hand-eye coordination, Snap if you will. The confusing shapes and colours make it pretty hilarious, but as a fan of heavier games, I can't find it in me to rate this too highly, especially since it's essentially Snap.

RATING: 6
I like grabbin' games, and Jungle Speed requires some pretty quick reflexes. I especially like every card has an "almost" matching pair that forces you to double take.

Not quite as exciting as I hoped, several players drifted off during play and there's only so much scrambling for a stick I can take, but it is a cool party game to get people warmed up for Brass.

The initial concept is good: flip over cards, people who match have to grab the totem. Not just that, but the symbols are designed to be extremely similar. The biggest catch is that the game slows down when you have the weird symbols pop up and people forget what they do. Not only that, but the game is clunky towards the end game where people wonder if the game is over yet. Egyptian Rat Slap is probably the better game and available for much cheaper as it is just a deck of cards.

I really enjoy keeping some party games and dexterity games around because they are a great way to suck people in who might otherwise turn up their nose at gaming.  I also love games that can span to any number of people, they are good staples to have.  This meets both categories.  Sometimes people can be a little turned off by players that are too aggressive, but barring that, this game has always been a good time.  I love when the board is full, everyone has a bunch of cards, and you can see the tension plainly written on everyones face as they watch each new card flip like a hawk!

Bought on Black Friday 2012 for $10 and change at Toys 'R'Us.  My 11 year old daughter and I enjoyed playing this 2 player.  We also had few 7-player games when the cousins came over.  That was an extremely loud and rowdy game....we had fun mocking those who grabbed the token when there was no match, etc...

This game is basically a more engaging version of spoons.  Recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Fast, simple, zany, and fun!  Flip a card; if it matches someone else's - a fast duel to grab the wooden toodum in the middle of the table then takes place!  Anyone can play as you need the skill of eyes and hand (unless you are laking one of those).  It also has that lets play again right away feel to it.  3 special cards also add some nice variation that can easily be explained when they come up for new players.  Highly recommended for non-gamers and gamers alike.  Everyone is gonna have a good time!  :)

RATING: 9
Fun pattern recognition variant on spoons - or as we called it in high school, the destroyer of furniture.  Warning, can lead to raucous behavior!  I really like this a lot though, versus just getting some spoons and a deck of cards, is that the pattern recognition aspect levels the playing field some.  These are symbols that you are not used to seeing and even when you do get used to it, the subtleties are such that it's still easy to "disrespect the totem."

--Dec2015-- The first time I'd played, my kids were young - and I couldn't imagine it working for them (even allowing for how well it worked for the twenty-something folk with whom I'd played.)  Now my youngest is 13 - and it turns out the game works wonderfully for him and his sister.  And, as a consequence, I like the game better too!

This game reminds me a bit of Anomia, but without any giving of answers - all action is based purely on symbol/color matching (with a few extra "special effects" cards thrown in to make the game interesting).

Pros:
-The game was just the right level of challenging for our group (all adults!). At first it seemed like the basic premise would be too simple, but many of the symbols are close enough to each other that you really have to pay attention! This definitely kept the challenge level up and made it so that we had a few accidental totem-grabs in our game. And if for some reason you don't find it challenging enough, the expansion pack really takes the theme of similar symbols to a whole new level.
-Perfect for 4 players, and can easily be adapted for 3 players

Cons:
-There was literal bloodshed the first time we played this game. I actually debated about putting this into the 'pro' section, because this level of intensity can actually often be a sign of a really good game...
-We got a little confused by some of the special effects cards (we had unknowingly been treating all of the blue inward arrow cards as outward arrow cards, totally missing that some pointed inward!). It also takes a bit of practice to get used to the consequences that follow each of the different actions, with regards to who gets stuck with which pile(s) at which times. I think this will come with continued game plays though.

I'm excited to continue to play this one - we have the expansion deck on hand too, but we're not quite ready for that level of challenge just yet... ;)

22-Jun-2012: This is a fun mental and physical dexterity game, although you'll have a hard time winning against Dave Corbin or women with long fingernails. It rewards fast reactions. Your goal is to eliminate your card stack. Players one at a time turn a one card from their stack. Often, the card means nothing and you just go to the next player, but sometimes it is a match with another card on the table. This is the signal for you and the player who has that other card to go reaching for this wooden baton that sits in the center of the table. Whoever grabs it wins and the other player takes some some cards from the winner. There are other situations that come about, but that's the gist of it. Many of the symbols are similar looking, often leading to incorrect grabs or start-to-grab but pulled my hand back. It's possible for the whole table to reach for the baton, and in this case someone usually gets scratched or punched or has the baton knocked into them. Despite the danger, it's a pretty fun filler.

28-Dec-2012: Got my own copy. This edition comes with a soft, lightweight, hollow plastic baton. Points for safety, but I may miss the danger...

I liked this game a lot better the first time when it was called Egyption Rat Screw, and you played it with a regular deck of cards, and it didn't suck. I guess it's amusing that the cards are purposely similar to trick you, but then it's also amusing that a Stanford sports team is named after a color rather than some animal, but that doesn't mean I like football.

Speed games have really not been my thing for quite a while.  Back in the day, a twitchy game like this would have been right up my alley.  Not so much anymore.  My hand-eye coordination just isn't what it used to be.  Actually, the biggest problem is that my recognition speed is not what it once was.  Still, I have a good friend who really likes this, so I am happy to play with him from time to time.  Sometimes, amazingly, I even win.  [06/28/2009]

Great at what it does. 

What it does is it balances between between quick reflexes and pattern recognition. It's a fight between sight recognition, cerebellum and motor coordination. It will reward repeated play (but might need expansion for very enthusiastic players). Patterns come in 5 families - families are easy to tell apart instantly, the patterns within families less so and there are special cards which help either those better at physical reflexes or those better at visual recognition. The physicality, constant engagement, ability to improve oneself within a game and the visual style make this game great for teenagers. It's addictive too. Quite fun, really.

For normal people - I tend to use the game as a "wake me up" instead of coffee between longer gaming sessions.

Rating lowered for base game, because I think it's that better with expansion.

Probably the #1 dexterity game of all time. 100% skill, a game that rewards you over time. It's definitely not for everyone as it is super cutthroat. My journey with this game started when I got introduced to it at a meet up. The first few games of it, I got slaughtered by really talented players. I didn't feel defeated, just motivated to get better. Its a game that can be taught in 2 minutes, and played in 5 to 15 minutes. Its a game where the journey is more rewarding than the end. Sure it feels good to win, but the real reward is winning a huge duel for big stacks against an opponent better than you. Even though this game takes a few minutes, sessions could go on for an hour or two because people will constantly want rematches or just want to keep playing.

Some of the patterns are quite similar, elevating it above the ranks of basic Slapjack or Slamwich.  I'm glad you have to grab the totem instead of slapping.  I want to try with four-six players.  Update:  Really fun with more players.  I think 4-5 is optimal.  Otherwise, someone runs out of cards too quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game much in the same vein as other quickness-centric dexterity card games like Egyptian Rat Screw, Slap Jack, or Spit.

There are a set of cards with different symbols and colors on them and a few special cards that change the rules slightly or cause a special action to occur.  When players flip over matching cards they reach for the totem and the quickest player gets to give their cards to the loser.  The object of the game is to get rid of your cards.

It's okay but kind of boring.  What cards you end up with and what order they come out are completely random so games can drag and especially if other people at the table simply have faster reflexes than you it can just be no fun.

A great little game to use a a filler between bigger games and to change pacing - not much to think about, since you just try to identify if someone has the same pattern (or occassionally color) as you and than react faster than the other person.

Always good for some laughs, though beware of long fingernails ;)

[Asmodee English edition] { Party; reaction, real-time, pattern-matching; optimal 6-8p} A fun party game for some game groups but not as fun as Fliegen Klatschen. Speed is very important in Jungle Speed. Players have to turn the card fast to create tension and fun.  Otherwise, the game will be very dull. Some patterns are quite similar and players have to be careful (and fast) to distinguish them. The arrow cards enhances game experiences very much, without them Jungle Speed won't be that fun. It's funny to watch someone makes a mistake :laugh:

It's engaging because you never know when you will be involved in the reaction. So prepare to react correctly and promptly.

(It seems the expansion cards are more interesting but it's difficult to acquire a copy from HK.)

Circa 3000 anni fa, nella tribù Aboulou si decideva come dividere le carcasse dopo una fruttuosa caccia, usando le foglie di eucalipto al posto delle carte. Il gioco tendeva a terminare in risse sanguinose perché la carte erano identiche! Questo errore portò all’estinzione della tribù. Per questo, due intelligenti Gametropologisti, Tom e Yako, hanno inventato l’attuale modo di giocare con le carte. Più di un milione di copie vendute per questo gioco veloce e frenetico in cui avrai bisogno di prontezza di spirito e riflessi fulminei per sconfiggere i tuoi avversari.

This is without a doubt the all-time greatest reaction game.  Jungle Speed pits your eye/hand coordination against the other people at the table in a way that is seldom seen.  The game is almost dangerous based on how fast you need to move, but that's part of the fun.  Play this with experts and it's one step below a ninja action film.

If you like reaction/reflex/speed games, this is the king.

This game always seems to get people excited. Great for winding down or up :P You need a smaller table for this though so everyone can reach the totem, so it isn't an unfamiliar sight to see 7 or 8 people huddled around our card table playing. Another game we have given away as gifts.

dont mind playing this a little bit; but Slamwich seems more fun, because it is not based on responding to geometric symbols but rather the more logic of the pattern of foods that you see; and these can get fairly complex at high speed. Also we house rule Slamwich to add several more patterns of foods that can be spotted. NOTE Jungle speed can cause injuries to fingers, really.

Very light and fun reflex game. Very popular with pre-teens and above. I can't imagine playing with more than 6 as the distance from the totem would be unequal.

Have only played once, but I like Spot It and Ghost Blitz more. I found Jungle Speed frustrating because a lot of the patterns are so similar. I know that's the point, but it seems like it would take a few games to get used to the different patterns and to get everyone onto the same level. Spot It and Ghost Blitz have a smaller learning curve.

[thing=8098][/thing] is a quick and clever dexterity and eye-to-hand coordination, since not only is required to have speed to grab the central piece when needed, the agility in recognizing patterns, as to know if you do or don't go for the piece, is key in doing well in the game.

The goal is get rid of all your cards - when two symbols match, the first of the envolved person to grab the piece, give all the cards she have played to the other that didn't. However, if someone grabs the piece by mistake, she takes the cards played by everyone else! Also, some cards make all playersgo for the piece, or change the method of play, in order to bring more difficulty to the gameplay.

[thing=8098][/thing]  works very well, but requires a bigger number of players to shine more - around 5 or 6. This is specially true do the way the game allows players to try to make others do a mistake, pretending to go for the piece when they don't will actually grab it, leading to fun moments. Approved.

It still hasn't beaten out Halli Galli as a favorite, but that's probably just because it's new - the kids seem to have a complete blast when playing it.  Sometimes we just seek simplicity in a game and a large dosage of fun.  Jungle Speed is enough to drive a mild mannered player nuts but can be fun in large groups (the game goes up to eight players) and certainly makes for a good icebreaker game.  I won't be playing it too often, but I'll certainly bring it out when the situation calls for it and when kids are around - that situation will often occur.  See my review for more details...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love action/response games. Jungle Speed is a great one. No counting is needed. Finding a pair is what you need to do. SIMPLE, but VERY PLAYABLE.
Note: desperate players usually get hurt in this game. They cannot decide or ask themselves if they should and when they should engage in a duel. Wrong timings make them brutally play this game. On the other hand, there are many non-gamer geniuses who can often win the duels and games while playing it gently. GAMERS please learn.

-A surprising amount of laughs

Bad:
-Experiences players have a huge advantage
-Why do the arrows on the color card point in?
-A storage bag was a poor choice
-Can make people feel dumb
-Long term replay value is questionable

Overall:
A nice light dexterity game that teaches quick and plays quicker.  In my group, players typically laugh as much playing this than any other game.  This is a great game to show your friends that gaming isn't just about wizards and orcs.

The most perfect reaction game ever made. Only gets better the more players you add. Make sure you emphasize the chance of physical harm and make a big show of removing all breakable items from the vicinity to increase the allure. I once knew a guy who played it on a picnic table. He fractured one of his fingers when it got caught inbetween the slats on the tabletop. He then went on to finish the game before going to the hospital.

In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.

Despite the numerous accidents that may happen during this game (once the totem smashed into my eye) it is a very very fun game.If everyone flips their cards correctly and no one hesitates, this really kicks ass.Mostly i change a certain rule:when 2 players have their hands on the totem,they have to fight for it!(rules say : player with most fingers round the totem wins)
Jungle Speed is a great introductory game,lots of action, lots of fun.
My issue: playing the last game (2 remaining players) may take a while.  Also:it's overpriced but i think it is a musthave!

I generally like these kind of pattern recognition / perception games, but because you have to grab the thing in the middle of the table instead of saying something, it basically devolves into fighting. Also it's mostly just waiting for the same thing to show up so it's not at all as insteresting as, say, SET.

Después de todo un fin de semana jugándolo con muchos de mis amigos, tengo que decir que es un juegazo: es muy rápido, entretenido y divertido. 
A la mayoría de nuestros amigos no les gusta jugar y sin embargo uno de ellos ya ha dicho que se lo iba a comprar.

Las partidas son muy rápidas (unos 15 minutos) y no dejas de reirte con las gambadas de todo el mundo (incluidas las tuyas!)

RATING: 9
Good card game, based on speed and reflexes. if 2 cards have an identical shape, be the fastest to grab the totem, or get all the cards!
The more, the merrier (I'd say that JS become really fun for 4 players and more)

RATING: 9
A dexterity game where you flip cards, check for matches with your opponents and then grab an idol in the middle. Some undeniably fun and hilarious moments, but some folks are always going to be better than others at a game like this. Best to not treat it too seriously, and you'll have a good time.

Everything is more fun when done quickly and dangerously: cutting hair, skipping rope, shooting skeet, and grabbing knobby things that are upright on a table.

Update:

Would receive a higher rating, but it's possible for the game to play longer than it should.  This might even be the rule rather than the exception.

See the same cards and grab the stick. I really don't like speed games so not for me. Works fine for what it is.

Great fun with the right group. I just love the tension it generates. Similar symbols force you to stay fully alert all the time ... and bluffing when you just pretend to grab the totem ;)

I have no choice but to rate this a 10.  There will never be a time in the foreseeable future that I will not have a desire to play this.  It's crack, man....plan and simple.  

*EDIT* Bumped down to a 9 due to accessibility. It's easily a 10 with the right crowd. But that crowd is small.

Can be fun. But also can lead to tears with the young ones. The action cards are not automatic for me which weakens the game.

Dexterity game that is great for moderate sized groups. Really fun game that tests pattern recognition and reflexes. Lots of hilarity ensures when wrong moves are made and the offender gets more cards.

Surprisingly fun filler/party game. Chaotic and fun. The expansions can make things crazy. We tailored the deck to have all similar cards so it's really intense.

This is a very fun, and funny, quick action game. You need a sharp mind, and good reflexes to win it. My kids have enjoyed it since the age of seven, and so do casual gamer relatives, and hardcore gamer friends. It's hard not to have several good belly laughs during a play of this game.

This game has worked really well with the non-gamer crowd. It's light, fast, and very easy to explain. The fact that it ends quickly makes it addictive for some reason. Having the cards so similar leads to fun mistakes and lots of laughing.

Fun and chaotic, but also resulted in some disputes and broken household articles (glasses, fridges, etc.).

Could still be considered an "ok" party game, but I think there's much better out there, now.

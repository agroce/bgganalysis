Fairly disposable game and extremely simplistic. Your picks are limited to just a few cards in hand - much like Kingdom Builder. It is the use of those cards that makes or breaks you. But fear not: wild cards will come around eventually (everyone has the same cards) and solve a number of problems. Very little to do in the game lead me to be rather ho-hum about the experience. And the theme while somewhat original is yawn inducing just the same.

Really simple, yet agonizing, tile placement game.  Almost multi-player solitaire.  It doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's fun, and right up my alley.  Not as much [b]Vikings[/b] as other reviews would lead you to believe.

I am beginning to think that Kiesling minus Kramer really isn't for me.  Sanssouci is a puzzle-ish game in which players try to complete columns and rows of tiles on individual player boards.  A third way of scoring is to move nobles who each specialise in tiles with a specific garden feature and will only end a move on a tile of that type. A hand of just two cards often offers the choice of four or fewer random tiles per turn.  Player interaction is nil, unless you count reminding someone to flip a replacement tile.  Once the possibility of moving nobles down the board by indirect routes has been grasped, you have pretty well plumbed Sanssouci's strategic depths.

Production quality is to good standards, the artwork is rather bland.

try to get at least one complete row and one or two columns. Key is to manipulate available choice so most cards are played as jokers. Solo variant: just roll a d10 to remove a tile from the central board.

Sanssouci is a medium light game designed by one of the "Robins" of Wolgang Kramer (if mr Kramer is Batman, Ulrich and Kiesling are his Robins...).
It is a tile placement game, where the tile placement part is reminiscent of Vikings, but much simpler and straightforward.
The game lasts 18 turns, and every turn each players plays a card (from his hand of two, dealt from his 18 cards deck: so the deck is also the timer...) to acquire a garden tile from a common display, to be placed on a player's own board. Then the player may move a noble to score some points.
The rules governing tile acquisition and placement are "gamery", but also quite simple, so the game can be thaught even to non gamers.
The feel is a bit chaotic, and sometimes one has no real choices, but nevertheless some skill is involved in playing it.
For a couple's half an hour filler, it is pretty decent.

My favorite light game to wrap up the night after a nice heavy Euro, or learning new games. It's quick, non-confrontational, and in a 4 player game almost purely tactical rather than strategic. Use draw bag for new tiles to make setup a breeze.

Sanssoci is a spatial game. It feels more luck-based than I prefer, so I don't plan to pursue it.  Buy an available tile and place it where it is required to go or flip it as a wheelbarrow to another spot in the same column or row.  The options are pretty limited.  Planning helps, but I'm not sure it would do enough to fix all the luck.

A nice, light little game. Although the main mechanics seem like there is a lot of randomness (both in card and tile draws), I find you always have something to do on your turn, either to move your nobleman, work towards completing  row or column, or setting up gardeners to better increase your scoring network. It kind of has an "engine building" feel because of this: the more the game progresses, the more you can take advantage of the infrastructure you have built to score. Plus the theme and setting are absolutely lovely.

Sanssouci is a deceptively easy game to learn. The game takes a lot of strategy to stay ahead of your opponent. It scales well for 2 players, which is our normal game play.  Ours end points have been very close with a couple of ties! The components are very sturdy, and the artwork is quite fetching. Overall a lovely game!

I thought the rules are manageable enough to be able to play quickly on your turn. It made me feel a bit irritated when there's a long downtime. 

The last part of the game (counting stage) seems to be the most fun of the entire game - kinda reminds me of the better game Carcassonne.

The theme fell flat on me so I tried to enjoy the game as much as possible through learning the mechanics.

Someone described this as an abstract puzzle optimization, which I believe fits pretty well.  I enjoy this type of game, and Sansoucci works well for my family.  There is quite a random element with the draw of 2 cards, but the point is to make the best of a bad draw and see what alternate routes you can create.  Enjoyed this quite a bit.

RATING: 5
At first I thought that Sanssouci was a brilliant bit of game naming wizardry, but then I learned that it actually refers to the summer palace of an 18th century Prussian emperor who wanted to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Berlin court once every while. It still remains a bloody good name.

The game itself is odd and hard to compare to others. It is about tile laying then then moving a noble to a deeper level in the garden. How the noble gets there is not specified: he can backtrack, he can go sideways, whatever. As long as he ends up in the same column he started out from, at a lower level. The deeper he ends up, the more points he gets, but also the more points you as player shave off the VP potential as skipped levels cannot cause a payout. Tiles get added by selecting from then an open market by playing a previously randomly drawn card and then placing them in a precise location. If that location has already been filled, the tile becomes a gardener which just provides paths to other areas of the garden—you hope. Needless to say, gardeners and nobles to not mix: the noble may pass a gardener, but not end his movement there. If you play a card which does not have a matching tile on purpose, you get to select a tile on your own. The rules expressly encourage this sort of behavious. At the end of the game all cards of the personalised decks have been played, a bonus is paid out for every column and row filled, and the player with the highest score wins.

At first the game feels weird, as I indicated, and then after a while you learn how to deal with the randomness in the card draw, namely by creating cross connections to shift the noble throuh all sorts of hoops and whirls to his destination, bypassing the need for straight paths. This is a good family puzzle. Unfortunately the tiles themselves enter the game completely at random, and this is actually where Sanssoucci would lose the grizzled gamer. Still the game has a compelling care free-feel to it, explaining in my opinion its high location on the Fairplay scouting list @ Spiel in Essen.

Tile-laying game Sanssouci is to create a flower garden for the world-famous Sanssouci Palace. Competing against up to three other landscape architects, you'll have your own garden layout game board on which you'll build rose gardens and vineyard terraces, labyrinths and fountains – but not just anywhere, mind you.

kaart nemen en dan een tuintegel plaatsen in het vakje waar de kolom en rij elkaar kruisen. Via deze tuintegel kan je je meeple dan laten zakken. Hoe lager je meeple komt, des te meer punten hij scoort. Indien er geen plaats meer is op de specifieke plaats, dan kies je een andere plaats in die rij of kolom. zo probeer je verbindingen te maken waardoor je meeples kunnen passeren. volgens dominique van de tafel plakt het beste familiespel van essen 2013.

A perfectly pleasant garden-building tile-placing game.   It has shades of Don Quixote or Hanging Gardens in it, but doesn't quite measure up to those even-more-pleasant diversions.   The need to score the meeples as frequently as possible keeps a decent amount of tension in the game.  The secret goals are there to insert some uncertainty into the final scoring.   The tiles are unusually thick and glossy for Ravensburger, and that makes the stacks a bit cumbersome.   Too bad the art wasn't bigger, as it can be a little hard to tell what the tiles are at a glance.   I'd play again, but nothing I need to own.

Ravensburger-thick tiles which are placed to optimize points.    Gateway that takes under 5 mins to learn and is easy to teach.  

You may quickly see a few ideal approaches, and at that point it's a mainly seeing how to use the opportunities as they avail themselves.

Tile placement that's not for everyone, but we like it.

Lighter game from Vikings designer Michael Kiesling.  Family friendly with all the hall marks of a nice light euro that looks great and plays well, is non-confrontational, yet involves enough decisions to keep it interesting.  Theme is about building gardens with paths on which nobles walk.

The bottom line: "Sanssouci is another family game by Michael Kiesling, designer of Vikings. It has all the hallmarks of an exceptional family game, including beautiful components, a simple rule-set, enough decisions, and a very reasonable play-time. This impressive game even earned a nod as one of the "Recommended" games at the 2014 Spiel des Jahres Awards. While it's never going to become the main course at a game night, it deserves appreciation for doing exactly what it sets out to do. It is a solid entry level game for families, new gamers, and even for gamers looking for some lighter fare."

Random card draws with random title draws evened out by strategic and tactical plays. Building a royal garden reduced to filling rows and columns for points. Meh.

Kind of wish the placement rules provided some logical benefits/penalties. 

Big City is more fun and faster, in that game the aesthetics of placement matter and your fighting for space in a shard space.

Sansoucci is each player building their own version with no need to worry about what you end up with.

This game seems too long for what it is, and it often leaves you with no real choices.  That doesn't mean there's no skill in it, but it doesn't interest me at all.

It reminds me of a way of Baltimore & Ohio.  You very much want to advance a piece downward every turn.  You can do so safely by moving not very far, but this risks being unable to move at all.  So you need to decide how far to press your luck.  It's like deciding on a dividend amount in B&O, knowing that it's critical to be able to increase the dividend every OR.  This feature is extremely off-putting to me.

Nice enough, quick to play, slightly confusing at first. But ultimately, I felt I had little control over my choices and not enough variation in the offerings. It mainly came down to least worst decision, which is not a recipe for fun. Nice ideas though. I liked the descending meeples as a mechanism.

Relatively gentle game.  Each player selects tiles to make paths through his garden so that the nobility can wander freely.  The tiles are drawn from a common pool but when I've played it everyone has been so focussed on their own game that they don't try to obstruct anyone else.  Score up at the end.   This could be a good game to plsy with friends who aren't really into board games.

A game of drafting tiles with, in many cases, very restricted choices, a little push-your-luck and building a garden for the nobles to stroll around in. Except for the shared tile drafting area, Sanssouci is a solitary puzzle where you try to align your action cards with what is available each turn. Not bad as a light family game, and as such it fits the Ravensburger line pretty nicely.

Now this is my kind of game.  It's quite "thinky" and random but, you've still got a good amount of choice I feel especially in being able to use the gardener, if you can.  I really like the beauty of the boards and art on the cards, too.  It's simplistic and still deep enough to keep you interested from turn to turn.  The only nastiness comes in the way of taking a tile someone else wanted but, since you don't know what anyone wants, it's a sort of "that's just the way it goes" type of game.  Highly recommended!

That's a tragic design flaw, in my opinion b/c other players will have an advantage with endgame goals even before I started playing.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Have only played the base game but it was an interesting puzzle to attempt to solve. If one doesn't look far enough ahead, the last couple turns may end up being worthless. Quite a few different ways to score and different directions to go.

This has all the trappings of another stale puzzle-Euro, and in a lot of cases, that's what it is. There's little interaction, the theme is dumb, and you're fighting the game more than the other players. Yet there's something about it, though I don't know what. I generally don't like these kinds of things, but if I were to play one, this would not be a bad one to play.

Sanssouci is designed by Michael Kiesling, but this is no Vikings. It's a very light and relaxing game, with very restricted decisions. You're placing tiles based on two cards in your hand, and every so often you'll be able to make a clever play. Most of the time you'll be grabbing the obvious tile, placing it on your board, and moving the nobles down. Even the secret objectives are just one column for you to max out as much as possible. This is as family game as a light euro can get.

The puzzle element is very nice, you really have to be able to see which gaps you can fill with which tile. Moving a noble at every possible occasion is also key to winning this game.
Some may not like the fact that at first sight, the game seems to limit the moves you can make. This is actually a key feature that is often forgotten: if you have a card that doesn't apply to any  tile, it actually becomes a wildcard that lets you choose from the entire board.

Game that can be compared to Alhambra. You collect the tiles of sets that are interesting to you, you pay with collored cards, you score points if you collect a lot of tiles from the same sort, and it's a light newbie friendly game that can be played with anyone. Simple rules but enough game fun and very nice looking material. 
Thematically it has some credibility.

I love the variable player boards, advanced boards, and player goals.  They all really help replayability.  I love the optimization challenge and the evolving gameplay.  My only concern is the luck factor.  You're entirely at the mercy of the which tiles come out on which colors.  At 2P, some of the more undesirable tiles may clog certain areas.  It would be nice to have a way to refresh the tile tableau.

Nice family game. Easy rules, light and pleasant, with just enough strategy for a gamer to enjoy. Reminds me a bit of Oregon. Would like to play again with the included expansion.

Probably at its best with two players as you can occasionally take a tile to block and you can string two card plays together reliably (using the first to set up the second as a wild). I enjoyed playing with three players as well but probably wouldn't bother with four.

Very well-balanced game and fun every time out, you just have to make sure about 2/3 of the way through of what you can really accomplish.

I'm pretty disappointed in the graphic design of the tiles. I want to play this lightweight game with my mother, who's in her 80s, and it's not easy for her to distinguish the garden features from one another. It's no simple task for anyone, really, some features really do look pretty similar.

It's a very attractive game and it has the sort of length ('super-filler’ as the kids are saying these days) and depth that appeal to me. It's just missing something to engage me. It seems ultra-bland. Or perhaps I just don't get it, I don't know. 

I'll happily play it again but I won't ask for it.

It's a luck based tile laying game, with simple easy to teach rules, that progresses quite fast and can be finished under 1 hour. It also boasts some decision-making, but the mechanisms are what makes the game cool. 

On the minus side, the lack of interaction (besides sharing the tiles you pick from) that uses to provide fun to this kind of games. 

It certainly has nice ideas, like the noble descending scoring mechanism, but after a few games, I'm finding the luck factor to be too important. It's a fine game, but it doesn't live long.

The price might be a little steep for what it is, but it's not expensive and the components are nice.

[b]Sanssouci[/b] was received in a math trade (1/5/16).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Sanssouci continues to be a hit in my house, both of my kids enjoy it. The quick playtime is definitely a huge plus, this is on our shortlist when we want to play a half hour game that isn't a card game. Plays with my wife have been on the decline so I haven't introduced her to many new games outside of family game night, but I am pretty confident she would enjoy this if I brought it out.

I will also comment on the "advanced" game which introduces boards that cover part of the original player board. It introduces both - and + bonus space which make you have to plan out your garden paths with even more forethought. We now play with this in all of our games, it adds a bit more meat to the decisions you make without any additional rules. A year later and I'm still excited to play this and one I'd definitely recommend if you enjoy 30 - 45 minute light/medium games. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A great family Euro that is excellent with two players.
- Easy to teach, Sanssouici has simple rules while still offering good tactical depth (similar to many other Keisling designs).
- Perfect depth to play time ratio, a 2p game takes less than 30 minutes. 
- I enjoy solving the spacial puzzle this game presents from laying tiles to figuring out how to best move your nobles.

I was really surprised by this game, but ended up getting a copy because I am a fan of Michael Keisling's games. On the surface it seems like this game will almost play itself because it appears that your choices are so limited. However; it is those limitations that drive this game and really make you think each turn. There are enough possibilities while only having two cards in your hand that you always have decisions to make, but not so many that the game bogs down. I don't think this game will appeal to everyone because it is a bit dry, but the game remains engaging from beginning to end when playing with two. My only concern is whether or not it will hold the interest of my family since I can't see my gaming group getting into this one. I think my wife will enjoy it, but since I just taught her Royals I need to wait before introducing her to another game. If you're a fan of family weight Euros I'd recommend checking it out.

Got its first play on Mother's Day 2015.  Took a stroll through the gardens with my mom.  She loved it, and I loved it.  Great tactical tile laying game.  Each turn, you have two cards that limit which tiles you can pick up from the  "market area".  You have to make the best decision you can, place the tiles on your board, and strategically move your noblemen through the gardens to score points.  Great fun!

遊戲還提供進階的板圖可以玩，目前還沒體驗，即使是基本的版圖也很有樂趣了，完美符合家庭遊戲的定位。十分推薦!!! 惟一小小不滿意的就是板塊上的園藝造型畫太小了，再大個30%感覺會更美些XD

This is another tile laying game for 4 by one of my favorite designers Michael Kiesling. Honestly, it felt a bit dull to me. It's another game with color matching, and it rewards placing tiles in the top row and the bottom row of your board differently, which implies there are choices and different routes to take to victory, but as we played, we realized that while in general the game was enjoyable in a sort of basic way, you really don't have a lot of interesting decisions. You see, in this game you get a deck of cards and a hand of 2. Each turn you play one of your two cards, and take the tile that matches that card and place it on your board in the one place it goes. You see, there's a central board where the tiles appear. Each tile has a picture (indicating the column it goes in), and is sitting on a color (indicating the row it must be placed in). Often, the tile you want isn't in the right spot for you to take it, or your cards force you to take and place tiles in areas you barely care about.

My relationship with the modern Eurogame is tenuous, but I generally make exceptions for three designers, all of whose names start with K: Reiner Knizia, Wolfgang Kramer, and Michael Kiesling. Fortunately, Kramer & Kiesling tend to design games as a duo. This is OK. It saves me money. 

For whatever reason, this game has worked for my wife and me. It's a dreadful theme (satisfying the scrutinizing inspections of Aristocratic visitors to your garden, which takes place in the exact same palace garden as your opponent). The action also primarily takes place in your own board and not in a shared space. But it's a very smooth, very clean design, the underlying mathy spreadsheet is visually easy to parse, and the in-game struggle is not you against some kind of torturous minigame, but rather against a "draw two cards; on your turn, play one, buy a tile, place a tile, move a noble, score a noble." It's the same sequence of actions every turn, and that's sometimes exactly what the doctor ordered. 

I'd never compare it to Kingdom Builder in execution (mechanically, they're nothing alike) but it does have the same basic vibe decision-wise. The game comes in fighting against a narrowing decision tree, as on your turn you have the either/or of playing one of two cards. So you're always guaranteed to have that one choice, and sometimes it corresponds perfectly to one of two tiles on the board. But much of the time you can try to keep your options open, claiming a tile to turn your other card into a wild (to pick one example). 

There's a fair bit of luck in the game, and you may draw bonus cards that are non-contiguous while your opponent gets side-by-side bonuses, but that's all fine with me. It's 30 minutes of clarity, and I maybe give it more slack simply because I like games where your job is to keep the decision tree from making your decision for you.

There is definitely more to this game than first meets the eye. A read of the rules will have you expecting an extremely light and simple game, but once in the thick of it you may find some brain burning analysis paralysis. Still, it is hard to deny the charm of Sanssouci as you obsess over every card you draw just to take the most notorious garden stroll a nobleman has ever conceived. Look out for those pesky gardeners!

this is an enjoyable puzzle  game that really shows itself after a few rounds that it is tight.  you have 18 rounds to score during the game so you better make it count but you better make sure that you can make future turns count too and the cool thing about this puzzle is whether to take more points on a turn of take less to give you the opportunity to score more on a future turn.  A turn with a 0 or 1 can be devastating but the end goals and end scoring can make up for this and its hard to plan for this.  Just a fun puzzle game with little interaction but the interaction is up to players as it is completely defensive and can be as cutthroat as you want it to be.

I can think of a few gamers who would enjoy this rather solitaire experience. Indeed it would make a good solitaire game. The only player interaction is the background chanting "Please don't take my tile... Please don't take my tile...". 

You're playing 18 turns from a set player deck and trying to score points with the most efficiency. Place all the tiles in a row and it's worth 10 points, all the tiles in a column and it's five points. Score points along the way by moving your figures down the columns to different scoring levels. Here lies the skill in the game - you can move a figure along any path of played garden tiles as long as it ends its move in the column it started. So you can try and build a snaking path to the big points, while scoring a column or row along the way. Add your two secret objective card points to the mix and there's your score.

The problem is that tiles can only be picked up and placed in certain spaces through certain restrictive rules. (Where would be the fun if they made it easy?) So the right tile on the right coloured space at the right time is golden, whereas the wrong tile or the wrong coloured space or the wrong time is mud. And that's what you do 18 times, over and over and...

Okay, I get that you can probably play this cleverly and work out all the efficiencies that will get you a good score no matter what the tile distribution. It's just that I'm not really into games like that. It's a dry puzzle that some gamers will find enjoying almost to the point of relaxing. For me, I'd rather do something else with 45 minutes of my day. But that's just me.

Sanssouci --
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A card-driven, tile-laying game about getting uppity nobles to wander around in the gardens of Sanssouci. It’s light on rules, although new players might have difficulty differentiating a few of the garden features, and visualising how the gardeners can be placed. (OK, I [i]may[/i] be projecting a tiny bit.) What’s particularly neat is that a good chunk of points come from nobles as they move downwards each turn. This creates pressure to trace paths downwards so that nobles are able to score points consistently, all while keeping an eye on the endgame objectives and bonuses.

In the end though, the game rests on a random card draw and a rotating gallery of tiles. Prepare to be frustrated when a tile you have been eyeing is inadvertently snatched up by an opponent. It’s best approached as a quiet and tactical game, with each turn being a mini-puzzle on how you can optimise the cards in hand.

A játékosok kertet építenek. 18 lapunk van, amelyek közül 9-en a 9 különböző épületfajta található, 1 teljes joker, 8-on pedig két-két szín szerepel. A kert 9 féle építményéből minden játékos körében 10 véletlenszerűen áll rendelkezésre színenként kettő. A kezéből 1 kártyát kijátszva a kertje megfelelő oszlopába és sorába építheti le közülük az egyiket. Ha már van olyan építmény az adott sorban, akkor kertészként teheti le, amelyre a látogatóival nem léphet, de utat nyithat más oszlopok felé. Ezután egyik látogatónkkal lépünk az adott oszlopában lefelé, amíg akarunk, ezzel szerzünk minden körben pontot. 18 kijátszott lap után pontozzuk még a teljes sorokat és oszlopokat, illetve a játék elején kiosztott véletlenszerű titkos célokat. A játék 45 perc alatt szabállyal együtt, még négyen is lemegy. Könnyed, egyszerű, tetszett. Negatívumként jelzem, hogy engem kicsit zavart a különböző grafika ugyanahhoz a típusú kertelemhez, nehéz a jó felismerésük.

Az alapjáték stratégiája talán túl egyszerű, de a dobozban lapul kiegészítő is, amivel különböző pozitív, illetve negatív pont kapható egy-egy helyen a táblánkon, ha oda a megfelelő kertdarabot építjük. Ezzel már kicsit változik az egyértelmű stratégia.

Fun game! Mary had played this (at the Gathering, I think?) and enjoyed it, so I'd been wanting to try. These guys were setting it up and had a spot open -- so yay! 

Terry pretended he didn't know what was going on all game, and ended up winning pretty handily, I think ... grrrr! I was last :(. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player has a personal board is a grid with a few spaces (top row, parts of 2nd row) filled in with garden pieces (sculptures, plants, arches, etc.); each type has its own column. At the top of each column stands one noble meeple. There's a display of available tiles. On your turn, you take a tile and place it on your grid. Then, move one of the nobles on your board down a path; it must end up in the same column. 

At the end of the game, score points the further down each noble has moved. Also, bonuses for having completely filled in rows of of tiles on your board. Most VP wins.

I was aware of the qualities of Kiesling as a designer from his efforts with Kramer of course, but ever since [thing=27173][/thing] I have been looking forward to his next solo project, as I enjoyed that game a lot.
This game is decidedly more family oriented than Vikings. Not that Vikings was this heavy strategic game, but this is very much a light/medium family game with some strategic and tactical elements but a very healthy dose of luck. But the rules are simple and the choices limited and that is perfect for the limited time this game takes. So for what this game sets out to do, it is perfect.

Sanssouci is a pleasant tile-laying game with almost unreadable tiles in any direct light due to their high-gloss finish.  The multiplayer solitaire gameplay is enjoyable and different.  Sanssouci would be a 7 with a matte finish.

Too simple for experienced gamers but obviously some concepts that are difficult to "get" for "non-gamers". The game itself is not complicated at all, but we played at Essen with someone who could just not remember that the nobles need to stay in their column and that you cannot just place the gardener anytime and anywhere.

4. Family

Great solo puzzle and my wife really likes it.  It's quick super easy to teach and has some strategy not a lot but enough decisions to make it competitive. One of the better family games.

Very simple, straight-forward mechanisms and lots of fun. We played it three times consecutively the first time! The theme of making a garden is fun and the decisions are simple but still challenging enough.

The production quality is excellent—we love the extra thick garden tiles.

Sanssouci is a game about building the perfect garden. There's a central offering of tiles. The tiles display a feature (hedge maze, fountain, pergola, etc.) and are placed in a particular color zone. You have a deck of cards which either show a feature or two colors. You start with two cards, play one and then draw a replacement. On your turn you select a tile by matching the feature or color with the card you play. If you have a card with a feature that doesn't exist in the current offering, it counts as a wild draw and you can take any tile. Whichever tile you take must be placed on your player board in the matching intersection of feature and color on your board. If the tile you take should go in a spot that is already filled, then you flip it over and it can be placed in any spot that is on the same row or column as the original spot. These tiles can later be moved through but not landed on.

You're trying to build paths to the bottom of your board mostly. You particularly want to build two paths because you start the game with two bonus cards for those paths. You also slightly want to build rows across the board, but not nearly as much. There are many spaces on your board where you get a bonus if you fill it with the appropriate feature.

After every tile placement, you advance 1 person down a path (they must end in the same column) and they get points according to which level they reach. So you really want to be able to get your people to the 6 spots.

The game is essentially multi-player solitaire. While your opponents could mess you up, that will only ever happen by luck. So it ends up simply being a puzzle of how best to play one of your two cards. That's somewhat interesting, but I feel that this game would get samey after a few plays.

Nice relaxing game,  the theme actually shines through, and there was something oddly fun about moving your nobles through the gardens.   

Well thought out an very balanced.  Not sure you can ever have a run away game.  Every game was so close, a tie with one Gardner breaking the tie.  Another 1 point win, etc.  May be too balanced when it comes to that.

But if you are ready to play a game to relieve some stress than this is the game for you,  light interaction, and calming to the soul!   The quality and production is amazing as well.

A fun easy game to learn and teach.  There is randomness but the game gives you some ways to work around this.

I normally wouldn't rate a game with this kind of randomness as high however, for me part of the fun is trying to figure out ways to work around that one or two tiles I'm missing.

All player boards are double sided with different pre-built buildings on them, the expert version "lay on" tile(s) are also double sided with different gardener and buildings spaces that will give you positive or negative points.

For such a simple clean game it is deeper then it first appears.

Rating may be a bit high - it could drop to 6 after I play more, but I'm hoping not. There is not a huge amount going on here, but I think what it does, it does well.

It's early (only placed 3x), but I definitely enjoy the light weight and puzzleness of this game. I'll comment more and perhaps revise my rating after more plays. Rating: 8.


After 8 plays, I found the base game (without the optional expansion boards) too simple and a bit boring. So we played several games using the expansion boards. That changed things up quite a bit. However, we both found (I play only 2-player) it frustrating. Specifically, I want to play the game strategically, but the expansion board makes it even more difficult than it already was. This is a tactical game, where you have some choices to decide on each turn, but if you try to follow a strategy, it could easily never happen due to the randomness of the tiles.

Also, in one of the games, neither of us wanted to take the blue tiles available, as they were both poor choices for our board for both of us. So they sat there the entire game, never changing. Going to have to house rule that situation, as it definitely negatively affected that game. Rating: 6

Sanssouci is largely a multi-player solitaire effort where one tries to puzzle out tile placement on a grid map. Theme is light and honestly not very apparent. The goal of the game is to pick up tiles to construct your garden in the most efficient way to score points. Movement of noblemen will also score points and ought to be performed every single round if possible. The game is somewhat of an "engine builder" as you lay down tiles based on a set of restrictions to maximize movement of noblemen throughout the game and to try and complete vertical and horizontal bonus scoring. By setting up tiles correctly, you can score points each and every round. I think the game shines in that you can see many ways to score points and to take pleasure in your ability to execute your plans. The frustrations come from not being able to have a good selection of tiles during your turn to choose from. So there is fair bit of luck from tile selection. Some of the tile placement restrictions also aren't intuitive and a bit convoluted as I constantly had issues remembering the tile placement restrictions throughout the game.
     Otherwise, Sanssouci is a light, simple and quick game that will go well with the casual gaming crowd. It does have a unique feel to it as compared to many Euro titles. This is a positive. For regular gamers like myself, this game will be entertaining if it comes out once in a while, but I won't be clamoring to play it every month. Whether this title deserves a place on the shelf remains up  for debate.

I bought this mainly because we visited the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam, Germany, and thought it was so beautiful. When I heard there was a board game based on the place, I had to have it! 

It's a light gateway-style game with a pleasant theme, but with some strategy involved to build the paths your nobles follow to earn the most points. In fact, we enjoy it more than we expected to.

Enjoyable puzzle like family game. If people really try and optimise every go, and over think it, then it doesnt really work. But if you play reasonably quickly and accept you wont always do the best thing, its a good 40 minute game.

RATING: 10
The original version was one of my favourite games for years yet I always felt a trick had been missed with the non-inclusion of the 1861 campaign. And then, suddenly, well okay, 20+ years later, there it was - well worth the wait.

I'm a newcomer to the series and on an ACW kick lately, and this system just works for me. 

If you're going to start anywhere in the series, start here. As much as I like the Western theater and like to see the rebels deal with leadership problems over there, this game simply has less chrome than BAC, and the Advanced (or campaign) games are shorter here.

The "Basic" scenarios are fast playing, perfect for learning and tournament play. The fact that they are used in tournaments underscores that these are not the typical wargame short scenarios, as the ones here are designed with playability and balance in mind. They are also fun and tense, and not mere throwaways. (MMP's partners in OCS development could learn a lot from this series).

I'm looking forward to playing it more and would like to eventually take on the "Advanced" scenarios (SJW is only about 15 turns; quite manageable). That said, it's a strange game that draws me to play all of the shorter scenarios first without having any shame about doing do so; I don't feel that this is a less-than-complete experience. In any event, it's sort of like every small scenario is another day of paradise, worth enjoying on its own terms, just one more step in a longer journey. You also get a ton of scenarios, and two games (AGA + SJW), so there's a lot of value here.

I don't find the rules procedures cumbersome; I've handled multi-step combats before in OCS and ASL, so this seems like cake after a few times. I'm starting to remember the dice rolls for movement, as well as the modifiers, so repetition pays off and definitely speeds play. Besides, the rules are crisply written, smooth, and have been refined to perfection; I wish the other long-established series games I've played could say the same. In this regard. GCACW puts others to shame.

The game captures perfectly that sense of every ACW battle of whether a commander should have taken a risk and pushed it, or waited, played it safe, and followed up the next day. No decision is easy, and the initiative dice can punish your decisions if your opponent does it right, as they most probably will. Combat is always fluid, mainly due to the fact that both players roll a die. Those modifiers that seemed like a sure thing can suddenly become meaningless if your opponent rolls high and you roll low. Seldom do your plans go perfectly.

The physical components are top notch: sturdy box, full color charts, a map to die for, and a color rulebook. You can tell MMP went the extra mile with production. That said, the only quibbles I have are cosmetic and have to do with art direction. I don't have a bias against the new art per se, but the type can be difficult to read on the counters. The rulebook type seems really small, and the glossy coat sometimes creates glare in certain lighting. Too, you'll need the HCR map to play a few of the AGA scenarios, but that doesn't seem like a big deal.

Overall, GCACW is a solid wargame series, and SJWII a fun introduction. Every wargamer should have this and try it, just to say they've had the experience.

I have really enjoyed the scenarios from All Green Alike and am very encouraged that this is a playable and interesting system.

It straddles the divide between grand tactical and operational, with a scale which makes the maps evocative and gorgeous but keeps the action ticking along.

The interaction between marching and fighting, and fatigue, exhaustion and disorganisation is very clean and produces a plausible rhythm and flow of events.

I'm less keen on how some of the command and control is handled. My instinct is the Union is given ahistorical advantages as an offset against generally higher tactical ratings for the CSA. But it can feel off, although the end results come out okay.

This is the first member of the series that I have no plans to purchase.  I own the original which remains a solid game.  Perhaps the system has grown too big, too rules intensive for what at its core is a roll and move engine.  Shorter scenarios in particular can be completely dependent on the vagaries of the dice.

A fine addition to the series. I'd never been that interested in playing 1st Bull Run, but I'm glad I did. It's actually a fascinating campaign. The scenarios are quite chromey, but that was probably inevitable. Really good fun though.

I find the 2nd Bull Run campaign and even the longer scenarios are tough to pull off for the CSA due to Pope knowing where everyone is. Pope's challenge is to concentrate, Lee's is to isolate Pope and hit them hard. Much easier to do that when the Pope player is as blind as the historic Pope. I'd love to play it with the hidden movement rules though, or even blind!

Le module qui m'a fait découvrir la série, une divine surprise.
Système élégant, scénarios variés, parties tendues. Bref un véritable plaisir ludique.
Seul bémol qui évite le 10, les règles sont rédigées de manière un peu trop compacte à mon goût.
Les deux campagnes proposées sont parfaites pour des débutants comme moi et jouables en des temps raisonnables, une bonne journée avec un rythme soutenu.

This is a great success: two games in one! Not already played the 1861 campaign, but three times the 1862 long game (SJWII). Very balanced opus, yet a bit hard for the Rebs, BUT each army has the opportunity to crush the other. Reasonable playing time (12-15h) and great replayability. 

A must have.

Redo of the first GCACW series.  A perfect blend of playability and complexity.  And the maps.. drool.   Traditionalists do not like the glossy maps and rulebook.  I think they are fine.  The counters have been updated too.. with colors!  I like it.

Rating based on one playing of "The Virginia Campaign" in All Green Alike. Both McDowell and Patterson got too big for their britches and were deservedly thumped for their pains (or, in real terms, they advanced too far out and then the Rebel player won a series of initiatives--such is war). This remains the best series on Civil War campaign out there (may be the only one out there). My only beef is with the horrid unit counters, although the markers are fine. I've saved my original SJW so I could use its counters instead when doing the 2nd Manassas scenarios.

RATING: 9
Great game and great series.  Not overly complex but enough so that it's not for beginners, and just a bit of chrome.  It hits my sweet spot for complexity.  The initiative system is a great way to mix things up and raise and destroy your hopes and plans every turn.  Every game is completely different from the previous one and keeps the game fresh.

This is an excellent system that results in a lot of narrative in each playthrough.  The box contains a [i]lot[/i] of scenarios, so I'm sure it will keep me busy for a long time.

The system is very intuitive and pretty easy to have down after only one or two playthroughs.  It also plays really well solo.

This 2013 ninth game in the GCACW Series by MMP is a delight to play and includes even more than the original version. The counters and maps are wonderful as is the easy to follow rules. Two army's maneuvering to strike one another makes this an exciting game from start to finish. A great game for learning history, or just having fun.

RATING: 8
The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War has a nice implementation of the command confusion in battle, simple yet closely modeled on reality.  The combat system itself is a maze of DRMs and convoluted rules that end up playing much more smoothly than they read.  Learning from someone else would be a breeze, learning from the rules not so much so.  All these DRMs serve to parameterize tactical actions going on within individual hexes, below the scale of the game.  Most of these elements would take place explicitly in smaller scale games.  The focus here is on pre-battle maneuver and winkling the opponent out of good defensive positions rather than on amassing overwhelming odds and supporting arms.  WW II it is not!  But Liddell Hart would be proud.

GCACW is the only series I've seen that not only tracks exhaustion and fatigue separately bu also tracks disorganization and demoralization.  It works, but is it necessary?  Likewise, Stonewall Jackson's Way II sets the record for the most different kinds of markers (61 by my count), but nonetheless plays quickly with even the full campaign playable in a single sitting.  The maps are both artistic and easy on they eye.  Some of the text on the units and player aids is a bit small though.  Setup is easy using the tables in the scenario book.  The player aid card is thorough enough to earn SJW II its moderate complexity rating despite the rules.

Bottom line: great game, but don't even attempt it without enough cupcake trays or the like to organize those five dozen markers types.

I was interested in enough by what I see in Battle Above the Clouds to want to give the series a chance to show what it can do in Virginia.  Who better than to let loose in that state than Stonewall Jackson.

Played in the Advance After Combat blind PBEM game as McDowell (Union III Corps).  Had rings run around me to the point it made me dizzy.  But it was fun!

Me ha encantado esta serie, y este  a la manera de Jackson en particular....
sólo he jugado un par de escenarios, pero veo el potencial de este juego.Las mecánicas han envejecido estupendamente, y el lavado de cara de esta nueva edición es espectacular...

Ahora a la espera de los nuevos de la serie...( me voy sentando...jajajajaja ) y a pillarme el battles above the clouds.

Muy recomendable... Eso sí, abstenerse los amantes del control total....aquí no lo encontrarás...

GCACW is a great system. The constant back and forth means little down time for either side. Beautiful maps and unlike some old school players, I don't have an issue with the 'new' counter artwork. 

Intricate combat system rewards planning, scenarios are well balanced. 

Obviously a challenge to play the Federal side in a Second Manassas campaign, but the Confrderates with their smaller army are gonna have to play well and earn a victory. 

Recommended!

Not a fan of the newer style counters.  Maps are somehow even better than the previous version.  Lots of scenarios and commentary, a fantastic value.  First Bull Run Campaign is quite good, although I would consider something  as an alternative to historical, like allowing Union to re-roll '1' results in combat, just to allow the Union player to have a more historical mindset.  MMP can be proud of this excellent addition to the series.

The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

Great maps, nice but busy counters, very convoluted rulebook. The latter is a step down IMHO from the original installment. The flanking rules could have been put down in an easier style. I found the chapters on bridges and fortifications (of which there are several types) especially a pain. 
The game itself plays much easier than it reads. As someone suggested, the difference between exhaustion and fatigue was perhaps unnecessary. 
Conversely the cavalry screening is brilliant - however it is difficult to recreate the uncertainties the commanders experienced in the field. 
The whole games are about manouvering but, coming back to the system after a few years, somehow I still find it difficult to recreate the  concentration of the armies and the epic and decisive clashes that followed. Maybe it is my style of (solo) play, but I think the system could be applied to Napoleonics just as well. 
A nice game, but overall it does not have an ACW "air" to me - at least for the moment.  But I do want to like the series, so I will persevere.

A redone version of the first game in the series, SJWII is like two games in one. What I'm finding here as a beginner is a comprehensive system and a lot of gaming material with information enough to keep me gaming for a year. I really like this series, and my usual opponent does too, so we're taking our time to enjoy this one.

I can see why people like it,  much deeper than I thought, but fun.   Turns can take a long time no wonder a Campaign game  would take several weekends.  It's all about maneuver in this game and thinking about where your attacking in relationship to the victory objectives.  Seems fun,  we'll get into it some more later.

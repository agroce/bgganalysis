Great easy game. With fantastic artwork.  The only flaw it has , are the rules that are a little bit tricky.

Um dos jogos mais despretensiosos que joguei em 2017 e que se mostrou uma grata supresa. Taverna tem bastante elementos para controlar e observar, mas também tem muita escolhas dificeis de serem mapeadas o tempo todo, o que deixa ele interessante durante toda a partida, principalmente do meio para frente. A qualidade dos componentes na versão BR é bem satisfatória.

RATING: N/A
Fun game play, but just can't get past the $79 price tag.  While the components are of good quality, they're not any more numerous or special than many other games that have much lower price tag.

May try to pick up a lightly used copy eventually, or wait for a price drop.

I was a little disappointed at first that this wasn't going to be a more thematic tavern keeper simulator, or something along those lines. But as a light to medium Euro with worker placement and area control elements, it's really neat, in particular how much attention you have to pay to the various scoring tracks, moving the dignitaries around, taking Royal favor tiles, and choosing your scoring opportunity at the game's end. Colorful components, cute artwork, solid effort here.

A well-oiled engine cannot be ruined by a single card, but it's still extremely annoying to have a spanner thrown in your works, even if it objectively can't harm you that much. There's a bit of disconnect between theme and mechanics, but here we have a game with interesting choices between money, spells, deeds and popularity that is ultimately more harmed than helped by the "take that" effects that some spells have.

Quand les nains ont fini leur journée dans les mines, ils retrouvent leur potes elfes, magiciens, etc ... à la taverne, pour partager une bonne peinte. Les aubergistes ont bien compris ça et espèrent bien avoir le maximum de clients dans leur établissement. Et les aubergistes ... c'est vous. Tous les coups sont permis avoir l'auberge la plus attrayante. taverna est un jeu de gestion et de pose d'ouvriers dans un univers médiéval fantastique. Si le thème vous plaît pas, remplacer les tavernes pour des bars ludiques et les clients par des adhérents.

I can't understand some people why rate a game after one play. This game needs 2-3 plays to take it your own, but after that, this is a brilliant, exciting euro. It has only a few rules, but there is much deeper tactics, than it seems. Additionally the graphic design is awesome, so I can recommend it without any lack.

Played at Essen, at the hotel. 5 players. 

Nothing special.  Bad iconography, unclear colors and art. Lots of downtime. Pasted on theme.

A clear disadvantage for the startplayer(s), cause he'll get stuck with the curse card, and has to commit on the tracks before any others, with no way of countering these disadvantages.  Also: mayor kingmaking problems during the endscoring, to the point that it felt pointless playing.

The owner/buyer of the game liked it a lot. Three others didn't like it. One didn't voice his opinion.

Nie podeszła. Tłumaczenie zajęło dłużej, niż rozgrywka. Sporo reguł, umiejętności klientów, a i tak brakuje czasu i decyzyjności by wprowadzić jakikolwiek plan w życie. I do tego pstrokata, napaćkana kolorystyka.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de col·locació de "losetas". Simula la gestió de visitants de diferents "tabernas".

No té mala pinta, però potser és massa sencill. El jugaria encantat per veure que tal, però dubto molt que m'agradés el suficient com per quedarme'l...

I want to like this game so much. In some ways, the theme and mechanics are married beautifully, while in others they appear forced and uninspired. The same can be said about the art, which is strong in most places, but absolutely terrible in others. Would really benefit from a more robust individual player reference sheet with a turn order. There's just a lot to do for small gains, and it really starts to feel like you're doing things just for the sake of doing them.

+Lot's of moving pieces and things to think about
-Counter intuitive mechanics (the Tricksters, the Dignitaries)
-Bad rulebook (mistranslations)
-Box is much bigger than it needs to be

Simple gameplay but LOTS of decision make this a deeper game than you might imagine at a first look. 

I would say is a great game to newcomers as it's really easy to catch but at the same time some more hardcore gamers might think there's too much to think and would be overwhelmed as you can have many options to do nice combos during your turn.

Have in mind that this is a tactical game and you won't be disappointed. 

If you are sensitive to downtime better not play with 5 players.

Seems quite simple: each turn you select one of four available customer and place them in one of five taverns on the board. Depending on race and class of customer you get boni, can use VIPs for special actions, get privilege token, can cast magic spells and so on. This is very much about optimizing your turn.
Enjoyable end game scoring: the player ranking highest on sympathy track of a randomly selected race chooses first among 5 different end game boni.

Worst game ever played, very boring. You only got nice pictures on the cards but a real mess on the board and the table tokens seems to be rubbish material. A big big deception. You wait you cannot anticipate much, you play, you wait.... very few interaction between players. The thing that give 1 point is the player help on a beer cardboard. DON'T BUY THIS!!!

Taverna is a tactical game: see what customers are available when it's your turn and take the one that works best for you. It's rare that there ain't one who does something good for you.

The rules could be a bit more clear on how the royal favour and spell works :s

Beautiful game. I would like to play it again with more players since I only played it with 2. Simple card drafting game to do actions and fill your taverns. Special abilities but might come down to luck of the draw. I am not sure.

Really fun to photograph and I do want to try again.

I like this game a lot! This is an initial rating. Can change after more plays. 
It s great that the choice of one card has so many consiquences. You can do great combo s. Think the game will become even better after some plays. 
There a bit of a risk of downtime because of the cascade of things. So some people are scared to make descisions. 
Anyway, i mike the look of it, i like the gameplay and choices ... So that s all that matters, isn t it?

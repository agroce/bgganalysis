RATING: N/A
reimagining  of Game of Thrones, in the L5R universe? I'll pass, GoT takes too long for me to even try it.

Wait, wait, wait, only an hour plus? Finally!  I always wanted to try GoT, but never could find the time.

Feels a lot like a lighter and more streamlined Game of Thrones.  The game has a lot of potential.  Don't play it with people who get upset with bluffing, backstabbing and nasty moves.

This game came out of nowhere just a couple of days before the end of 2017. My first impression was that it is a neat, good looking area control game mixing Risk and hidden action tokens from A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition). And it is just this, pure and simple, but still offers a lot of decisions, mind-games, bluffing, and player interaction! I also like the Japanese theme which reminds me of the upcoming Rising Sun.

The game is good. Simple to set up, simple to teach and the nuances are picked up after the resolution of turn 1 on your first game. If anything, it feels a bit like a card game where your tactical options seem to be limited by the luck of the draw for the turn, which can be frustrating if you can't push for the province that you're after that turn.

Could this be the new standard for game box sizes, please?

A full game, a full sized map, but packaged in a box that is a third in volume.

The game reminds of a hybrid between Samurai and a streamlined Game of Thrones. It is quite fun as a smash and grab. It is aggressive but not in a serious kind of way.

As is typical for this type of game, there will be a blowout in the last round, with a lot of death and destruction.

RATING: 6
Based on first play, with 5.

There are some neat, satisfying plays one can make with diplomacy, raids, or shinobi, for example, but they're very difficult to pull off because they're sensitive to timing, and you're unlikely to have drawn the right pieces at the right time, and you can only hold over at most one combat token per round.  We saw players frustrated by having limited agency from repeatedly poor draws with all their most powerful stuff coming at the end, where they were no longer vaguely in the running.  

For example, finally drawing the raid token in the last round felt useful only for messing with someone else's hard work (the perceived leader, or whoever you've built up the biggest grudge against) whereas drawing it earlier in the game provides a powerful tool to work towards your own objective or in defense against an attacking neighbour.  If we read the rules right, a lucky player could lock-in the completion of their objective in the first round if they draw a diplomacy token, manage to settle in their target capital, and see out the round without it being raided or shugenju'd.  Other players, meanwhile, may have to fight tooth and nail for 5 rounds only to narrowly miss it.

I also like the bluffing.

I also like the shugenja - the ability to zap one combat token (once per game, and again on your turn as start player) - particularly as it interplayed with bluffing.  But it felt like we were doing a lot of menial work to get to the state where *perhaps* we'd be lucky enough to pull off (or witness) one such fun interaction, and then we were left with significantly less agency, and therefore less fun, for the rest of the game.  Not such a problem if everyone plays really fast, I suppose.

Doesn't solve the main problem I tend to find with area control games: poor initial choices from a less-experienced player will determine much of the agency and success  that the player has for the rest of the game.

The clan symbols could be easier to tell apart, both in colour and symbol.  I didn't find it easy to read the board state.

There's some interesting stuff here and I would play it again (only with players who all knew the game and could correctly keep each other in check and not dig themselves a hole straight away), but I'd much sooner play El Grande or Mission: Red Planet (2e).

Really everything I've ever wanted from an area control game and I've been waiting for this one ever since it was announced. I have no idea about the Rokugan lore nor do I care to have. The mechanics of the game are simply great. It has secret actions in a light weight fashion, making it a very easy game to introduce players into. You can start playing right away. Also, all the tokens and how they are used are explained on the player screens so everyone can check the rules when they need to.

The cards add a nice tactical layer but there aren't that many of them. FFG are infamous for expansions and I feel like this decision was made in order to introduce an expansion later on. The few cards keep the game light weight, though. I just wish there were more cards and more tokens so that the number of tactical options would increase. Now the secret actions are more about "how strong is his army?" instead of "what is under that token?".

The only con is the color scheme. The pastel colors and how they've been applied make it hard to differentiate between the different territories. This is obviously something you get used to once you're familiar with the map but the game definitely made me sympathise with the color-blind.

Questions: Will half the number of turns of GoT be too short or a great improvement? Will it scale better than GoT to fewer players than the max? Will the ronin mechanic successfully keep everyone in the mix until the end (GoT is not great at that).

Solid game.  Visually, it's occasionally cluttered but there is a fair opening for table talk, planning, and turn by turn tactics.

:( I feel like this game wasn't play tested in it's final form. The small pale tokens barely stand out against the sprawling board, making it almost unplayable without standing up and moving around the table.

The gameplay itself is fine. But it lacks the control in Area Control.

Love that it captures the essence of the main mechanic of hidden unit deployment very well. However, it really depends on the group. With the right group where people will actually negotiate, this game will shine. Else, it will be quite meh.

Very attractive looking game. The box is beautiful and very compact. The art is beautiful, although with pastel colored tokens it becomes very busy. The game itself feels a bit like Risk, but much more so like A Game of Thrones, but streamlined. In this battle you are just dropping in your order tokens and in this way it becomes a kind of an informed blind bidding play to support the area control scoring. In the end Rokugan will probably be scorched and players' positions on the board may differ surprisingly lot from the start. What I very much like is that you may be beaten to dust, but it is still possible to mount a believable challenge for victory and in this aspect the game reminds me of Small World a bit as you may just enter the battlefield from all new directions. Funnily, while playing, this also reminded me a bit of Knizia's Samurai.

People have been comparing it to game of thrones the board game and rightfully so.

Probably a simpler version of Game of Thrones: The Board Game. I like the streamlined rules. We could get going after maybe 5-10 minutes of teaching. But in the end free for all area control is not my kind of playstyle. I just don't like it.

In the Battle for Rokugan, players lead one of the seven Great Clans of samurai whose honor and loyalty will be put to the test. The easiest way for me to describe the Legend of the Five Rings world of Rokugan is, “Game of Thrones set in a fantastical and romanticized feudal Japan.” Characters in this universe are samurai who serve as warriors, courtiers, priests, and monks defending their lord’s interests while upholding the Code of Bushidō – a code that demands that samurai ignore their own desires in favor of justice, loyalty, and honor.

Long-simmering rivalries and fresh betrayals ripple through the courts and on the battlefield, in a constant struggle for power among the seven Great Clans of Rokugan. But the Emerald Empire is beset by threats from without as well as within. There is an unimaginable evil beyond the defensive wall that surrounds Rokugan, which wants nothing more than to destroy the Emerald Empire, and is growing an undead army lead by demons that becomes more powerful each day it is left to fester. Dragons were slowly forgotten to legend, myth and, eventually, fairytales. The ability to harness magic is a rare gift, which can make it a dangerous threat or a powerful weapon.

It is this world that you are tasked to bring order and justice, while maintaining your honor!

RATING: 9
All the best bits from "Game of Thrones" plus more.

Maybe a few balancing issues need to be resolved with secret objectives, but otherwise awesome game and is currently sitting in the top 3 of my favorite board games. Everyone who has played has commented how awesome it. It has everything a area control game should have, tough decision making, deception, bluffing, tenacity, anticipation and strategy.

What has been really interesting is I have played this game now with 3, 4 and 5 players and it works great. Yes 5 players was chaotic but the game handled it beautifully. 

There is one downside to 60-90 min game. You don't get the same sense of accomplishment you get from some area control / 4x games which you require you to gather resources and build units, as you do not build any units in this game, rather you draw them from a limited pile. 

Be warned, this game forces you into some tough decision making from the first token and doesn't let up until the end, which is only 5 rounds away. Losing this game normally means your opponent managed to out think and out play you. 

Great game for a great price, but as soon as someone releases a 3rd party plastic upgrade kit for the tokens, I will be upgrading my pieces. As it is critical the tokens can not be identified by other players, there will be  issues with tokens getting worn or damaged after time, but this is not an issue yet.

My only issues are to do with the choice of pallet. Yes the colour pallet  fits the theme, but for a colour blind person like myself, I have to remove the crab or unicorn from the game completely as I can't tell the difference between these clans.

One of my favorite area control games.  It passes several of my tests: (1) I lost and couldn't wait to play it again; (2) everyone had fun, although they have different preferences in the games they usually choose to play; (3) the rules are easy to remember after you play it once; (4) it has layers and subtleties to discover; (5) it gave many moments of WTF and laughter; (6) it did not overstay its welcome.  It does play longer than the advertised time, clocking around 2.5-3 hours, but you are fully engaged from beginning to end.  The clans powers are distinctive enough, coupled with the starting positions, that different clan setups will play differently, adding to replayability.  Every time I play it again I discover something new, this game is a little gem.

Value:  lots of value for the price.  I like this box format.  There is hardly any empty space, it takes less space on your shelf, and it feels like you are getting good value for your purchase.

Designer responsiveness -- big kudos to Molly Glover and FFG -- I have asked some questions related to the rules (even though the rulebook is very good) and have received answers from Molly within 24 hrs every time

Ok, I have to admit that I love L5R and would be happy to add this to my collection. It's ultimately a wargame, but has some double bluffing mechanics like Letters from Whitechapel and seems to be a lighter wargame like Small World.

Seriously not what the L5R mythology needs on the game board. Mechanically sound (though based on the GoT orders system), this game is dry as dust and has little of the atmosphere that Rokugan should evoke. I *might* try it again with five (three players was disastrous), but I doubt it. The great strategic game set in the L5R universe has yet to be designed.

True story:
Me and my group have been gathering each Christmas for a few games of Game Of Thrones : The Board game.This process lasted around 7 years.
We love the thinking,backstabbing and bluffing aspect of the game.
...And then I took a closer look at the Battle for Rokugan.
Lovely game.
And by lovely I mean we freaking loved it .

I have a few friends that love this game coming from a risk back ground, and although i want to share that same liking for it, a massive killer for me is the tokens that are used, they are just too un-involving for me

Rokugan feels like a true evolution of the Game of Thrones formula.  The board feels much tighter, tactical objectives are clearer, and the Order Tile laying mechanic manages to be easier to teach while offering far more strategic depth than GoT's.

...But then Rokugan manages to hamstring itself completely by making those Order Tiles random every turn.  In effect, Rokugan isn't a strategy game, it's a triage game of trying to make the best use of what random actions you get to make this turn.   This makes it very possible that some players will become unstoppably strong by turn 2, while others have no option but to loose most of their early game territories.

Really tight area control, with all the depth of Game of Thrones but in a much shorter playtime, cheaper price point and generally sharper gameplay.

Superb game. Not quite as amazing, quick or as balanced as Samurai but really very entertaining. Putting down combat tokens and simultaneously revealing them is an excellent way of building up tension before combat and the cards won for controlling territory are suitably powerful prizes for controlling regions. Works really well with 2 players and even better with more.

There are some things I really like about this game.
+ Hidden tokens for attack/defense
+ Territory cards providing cool bonuses
+ Fairly simple rules
But, so far, my experience is that this game really likes to hate one of the players. There's a see-saw that happens when vying for a territory. However, all it takes is one player having a conflict with 2 to quickly whittle them down to a couple provinces. The advantage of the territory cards means you're unlikely to simply concede that one territory. But, your odds of winning a war of attrition against 2 (or more) players is unlikely.

I really want to like this game. Mechanically it's clever. But, I'll never play it 3 player again. 4 player was a little better, by the ganging up shifting a little through the rounds. I'm hoping a little more experience with the game helps, but the game is barely holding onto a 6.

Strategy and bluffing with secret deployment tokens on province borders for area control of the Emerald Empire among seven factions for honor influenced by hidden objectives.  Place-reveal-resolve-tally-eliminate-repeat. Each faction has a special ability but the base unit strengths and abilities are the same.  Claiming a territory gains a special effect card.

The simplicity and multiplicity of the decisions is a wonderful treat. A much more accessible alternative to the GoT boardgame. However, both games offer the wargamer something to be enjoyed, as GoT still has a more obvious accumulation of power toward the endgame, vs Rokugan's 'final hand' of saved tokens.

RATING: 7.3
A good game. The secret placement of action tokens is the main mechanism of the game. Rokugan is fluid. Victory and control over territories is by no means assured from turn to turn. A player can come back from what seems the abyss to win the game. Many will like the fact that there is no player elimination. One can play as a Ronin if they do not control any territories. 

Card play is included but limited. There are Territory cards and personal cards which include the Scout and the Shugenja cards. All are one time use. The Territory cards are important early in the game. They must be captured and played or one risks loosing them. Usually, there are 2-3 Territory cards available after the first round which are available in the second or third rounds. The Scout and the Shugenja cards are important as well as they can be used during the Combat Token Placement Phase to thwart your opponents plans. They must be played wisely when they are most needed. 

Rokugan is unique but it also has the feeling that you have seen parts of this game before.The mechanics are similar to Samurai in the sense that one draws tokens and plays them from behind their screen and plays them on to the board. The game also has the feel of Shogun or to newer players Samurai Swords. This is the hidden selection mechanism. There are differences from Rokugan regarding how both games employ these concepts. For instance, in Samurai the tokens are played face up to bid for control over a territory. In Shogun one bids for special actions from behind a screen, but one uses tokens to direct their attacks and takes cards from the provinces they capture. 

In Rokugan, one places their hidden Combat Tokens along or in opposing provinces with the hope that they will be the first one to control a territory so as to capture a specific territory card. The Combat Tokens are placed either to attack into a enemy province from the border of a province you control, or they are placed in the center of your province to defend. There are some interesting Combat Tokens. This includes the Shinobi, Raid and Diplomacy tokens. The Shinobi allows one to attack anywhere on the board and they can be strengthen by Blessing tokens, which are technically reinforcements placed on armies, navies or the Shinobi. The Raid token has the potential to create a buffer territory for you or to deny your opponent victory points. The raid token can only be placed into an enemy's province adjacent to a province you control, but can accompany a Shinobi token anywhere. The Diplomacy token has the same effect as the Raid token by creating a buffer zone, but one is able to retain the victory points. If one is successful in defending a territory they get defense bonuses which strengthens their control over a province within a Territory. 

There are some criticisms of the game which pulls it down a little. 1) There is some ambiguity in the rules. There is ambiguity in the player powers which need clarification. There is nothing in the rulebook to help interpret player powers. There is ambiguity in interpreting the meaning of some of the Combat tokens as well. A FAQ is needed. 2) Using the bluffing token is kind of worthless except for the Lion player. It has the potential to draw an opponent away from attacking you and defending their location, but it must be placed before the Shinobi or the Raid Tokens otherwise people will know it is a bluff. 3) The Territory cards are nice, but there are not enough of them. They are all one time use and then discarded. They are also powerful. Therefore, they are captured and used early in the game. It might have been better if they were usable each turn and also exchanged among players depending on who controlled the territories each turn like they are in Shogun when one adds up provinces. This might make the game a little longer but, it would add to the dynamics of the game. Alternatively, having additional cards to refill the Territory card locations for each round would increase card play and strategic decisions. These cards could be acquired as a reward for capturing a territory. At the same time, the cards could be retained by the player until they decided to play them rather than forcing the player either to play the Territory card early in the game during the Upkeep Phase or risk loosing during the next Combat Token Resolution Phase. Of course balance would have to be considered when designing these cards, but this alternative design would have added more to the game.

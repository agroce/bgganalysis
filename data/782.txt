A little long for a horse racing game and I'm sure there are better options around these days (Long Shot?, Royal Turf?) but when I first played it, it made my only experience of horse racing games (Totopoly) look pathetic. And who can forget that fantastic Rich Sharpe view of it in Tales from Bedbug Island in Games & Puzzles)

The only real knock on the game is the one Program of races. That's it, no more. Other than that this game simulates racing and betting better than any race game I have played. I rate this one right behind Winners Circle. It is deeper in simulating the betting and track racing which also make it a longer session. The fun factor and simplicity puts Winners Circle ahead by horse length.

I'm glad to see this game in the top 1000 as of this comment.  The theme is very strong:  i can almost smell the hay and manure in my stable after I win the auction, and I still feel the sting of losing a race by being blocked.  One eventually comes to love certain horses and tries to buy them each time they play this game, irregardless of strategy sometimes.  That's a rare depth in gaming.  However, I did lower my rating to 7 from 8 after playing it again, session report on file.

Damn, this game is highly underrated!  This game is loads of fun. Anyone that has ever actually bet on the pony's and got excited as they raced has expereinced this game.  I introduced this to my game group two years ago and they STILL make me drag it out to play again.  Lots of cool ways to bet, fun jockeying your horse, don't "throw" the race or the other players will penalize you..not fun! Gambling, racing strategy, pouring over the odds sheets...whats NOT to like?  Want some real fun?  Instead of a poker night, have a Win Place and Show night with some real cash, not big amounts..you know quaters dimes and nickels, and you get some REAL fun!

Fun game.  Here's a quick recap of two races we ran:

Last night we ran the 1973 Kentucky Derby and Secretariat came from behind (way behind!) to win by three lengths.  

The we started looking at the 1920 race and saw how strong Man o War was right out of the gate.  We agreed he'd be a stud at the shorter distances, but we thought it'd be fun to run him over the mile and quarter.  So we took horses 1,2,3 from 1920, and 4,5,6 from 1973 and ran Man o War against Secretariat at 1 1/4.

As expected Man o War took off into the early lead and Secrtariat looked like he wasn't even aware there was a race on.  The lead horses came out of the first turn into the back stretch before Secrtariat made it half way down the front stretch.  But then Secrtariat kicked it in and began to close.  As thy went through the second turn Man o War was still in the front, but fading, and Secretariat was just starting to move up to fifth place, but surging.  The whole field was pretty well bunched up coming out of the turn, Man o War on the inside and Secretariat going to the outside.  On the final turn Man o War moved first, crossing the line by 4 spaces.  When it came Secretariat's turn, he surged past the other horses still runing, crossed the finish line, but cam up one space short of Man o War.

That was fun.  We're looking forward to playing the full game this weekend.

With me, it depends on the group.  If you play this with people who have to win, it's okay.  If you play with people who like to gamble, root, hoot and holler for a horse to win a race and not worry about if they are winning or losing "the game", it's a blast and an awesome gaming experience.  Earlier rating 6, if like the second experience, 10.

I wanted to like this game more.  Unfortunately, in 5 races, the majority of the horses that finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd were "long-shot" horses.  It seems to be best to have a horse with a strong start since the races can easily finish 2 turns "early".  So don't put much faith in the odds posted for the horses... the odds must be based on a perfectly average race that takes the full number of turns to run.

This is one of my favorite racing games, like most of the others, it is a classic 3M title.  The wild thing here is that I have seen groups enjoy games in which only two people are jockeying the horses - and everyone else is just playing the auction / betting game.  The game makes excellent use of dice to add randomness while keeping the results of the race realistic.

This game is absolutely amazing, hands down the best horse racing game I've ever played.  The combination of control over the race (which features a really fantastic way of simulating each of the horses' pace) and a complex bidding component make this a true classic.  It's tense and exciting in away that few games published these days are, and it's great fun even when you're losing, spiralling into financial oblivion.  It doesn't look all that great and slow players can bag this one, but it's a masterpiece that discerning gamers are likely to fall in love with.  Toss that copy of Royal Turf onto the fire and step up to the REAL sport of kings!

I can admire this retro horse betting game for it's attention to capturing the actual betting odds of horse racing. It sure felt dated, yet official and honest. The core of the game is just another dice chucker race game that has been done to death since it hit the scene in the 60's. I will give it a nod for a fairly clever system of using one die to pick the order horses move and another die to determine the move bonus, but at the end of the day I just find roll and move games tedious.

An update could help things, since tracking information can be a headache, "so I own stabe W, which controls horse X, which is number Y, but when looking at the track I need to find horse color Z."

A blast from the past. Used to love this game as a kid. My most recent play was with too many people to allow for the better parts of the game, i.e., the auctioning and owning of individual horses; it was just a betting game. Nonetheless, I was reminded of how fun this one was and I'd love to give it a proper go with 4 or 5 people. 

The bonus numbers and speed elements give each race an infinite amount of replayability and depth and there's enough luck here to evoke the uncertainties of gambling. I simply haven't come across a better racing game and that includes Formula D.

My friend found this 1977 Avalon Hill horse racing game in a thrift shop, in pristine condition for $2.

I have owned a lot of the 3M/Avalon Hill Bookcase games at one point (but I had never heard of this one).  Some were great, others very hard to play--often I think, because the rules were often intimidating--certainly never an enticing read as rule books are today.  This game classifies, for me, as one of the really good ones--one that stands up nicely to many of today's games.  In fact I am rather surprised some of this game's horse racing mechanics have not been copied to recent games, at least none of the many I have played.

The game stretches out over 6 races, each of a different length, each with different horses and jockeys, which determine the accompanying odds. Another difference I like very much is how the horses move--all horses move every round, but the one who moves first is determined by the die, not their placement on the track. This means if the horse is hemmed in, its movement might be limited especially if it is being ridden by an apprentice jockey instead of a veteran. In addition, and this is very clever, only a few places on the track allow for a horse to "squeeze through", so for ending positioning on the track, an owner might decide to hold his horse back on one of these preferred spots since it is unknown who moves first in the next round. These mechanics mimic some realities of a horse race.

Horses are auctioned off at the beginning of each race and additional payouts are awarded to the owner.  The player with the most money wins. 

I think the optimum number to play is 3 or 6, because otherwise horses owned is uneven--and especially 6 players because each horse is then controlled separately and there is a much greater possibility another horse will be stymied in the race which makes the outcome more uncertain.

Even though this is a dice driven game, and a betting game, neither of which usually appeal to me, I nevertheless quite enjoyed this very different horse race, as did the other 5 who played.  This game does take about 4 hours to complete, but you can of course, adjust the length of game time by playing a reduced number of races.  I am looking forward to this game returning to the table.  Wish I owned it, but it is hard to find and pricey.

What a fantastic game.  A little less strategic than TurfMaster in the racing element, this game more than makes up for it in the horse auctions and wagering.  There's a lot of randomness of course, but it actually makes the game more fun as the long shots have a chance at the roses if the right rolls come up.  Fun when I did well, fun when I didn't, a sign of a favorite with staying power.

Rating after 1 play. It's an okay racing/betting game where players each own a horse and auction off any unclaimed horses. To move horses dice are rolled to determine which horse moves first and how far each horse will travel for the turn. Unfortunately, the movement isn't just using the dice . It involves looking up the movement for each horse on a chart based on the round of movement. It's a neat idea but it really is cumbersome. The game flows all right but it really wasn't all that interesting.

Easy game to learn, yet fun to play.  Players get to purchase a stable of horses before the preset races. Horses are rated for different racing styles such as pacesetter, come-from-behind, etc.  The betting phase adds another aspect to this game.  I would even recommend it for solo play.

The more players the better. We now make our own cards up with the newer winners of the larger events. Also we have a card (race) of the 6 great horses racing each other. Makes the younger players want to play the game. One other thing we do a little different is face the barns face down and buy a horse then look and see if you own it after the race has been played.

This really works! The horse-racing mechanic is a very clever and effective simulation of the real thing. It's mathematically complex enough that even with full information, players are usually in suspense for most of every race, but simple and clear enough to avoid some of the grim fiddliness of a lot of other 1970s sports games. I have the old Avalon Hill version, and while there's nothing stunning about the components, it's very gracefully designed and ergonomic, and the little cardboard racing programs each player gets are quite lovely.

This is one of the best horse racing simulations you can find in a board game. Old School, and that might turn some folks off, but give it a chance and do not let the length scare you. (2+hrs) A far better game than many of the popular horse racing games. There is a little luck involved but it is a horse race after all. I enjoyed the much more after playing it more than one time. The learning curve the 1st time through was enough that I felt out of control. Now that it all has sunk it it is just a great game. Also the 3m Board Box games have this really great old school feel to them, defiantly worth the $15 or so you can get this game for.

This game combines the racing strategy of Formula D with bidding and betting on horses.  Could be a "beer and pretzels" game with the right crowd.  The game could benefit from some player aids, as it was confusing to remember which horses one owned in each race.  I recommend using some colored tokens you can place in front of each player.  Still, a solid game.

This classic race-betting game seems, to me, mostly about luck.  I'm sure that being able to compute advanced probabilities in determining which horses to bet on would help, but really it all comes down to the die rolls for moving horses.  There's really no decisions to be made in actually moving the horses, as people can accuse you of cheating if you play non-optimally.  (I'm told that "advanced" players can play non-optimally without being called on it--but I'm not sure I even want to go there).  In any case, you make some bets, you win money or you don't, and someone has the most money at the end.  Meh.

RATING: 7
I played this a good few years ago as a filler with a few of my group of the day.  As I recall, it was not a big hit, but then the betting/horse racing theme was not really us.  

However, I often played it solitaire as a race without the betting, purely to marvel at the rather clever mechanics:  the two dice (one normal and one a bonus die) are rolled once per turn and each horse is moved on that roll.  Each race card lists the race length for 6 horses with ratings which are added to the normal dice score in turn; the faster horses have higher early ratings but their later speed ratings decrease dramatically.  Conversely, the horses with more stamina have a much more even spread of speed and like a longer race.  In addition, the horses with the shorter odds are more likely to benefit from the bonus die.

Consequently, if the early dice rolls are high the faster horses will benefit; if their bonus number also triggers, they will benefit even more.  A fast race normally means that the slower starters are left behind.  Initial lower dice rolls mean a slower race which favours the 'stayers' who streak away from the sprint specialists who are barely moving at the end.

The sheer unpredictability of the dice roll is key to the game.  In addition, there are strict racing rules to follow regarding overtaking on bends and illegally blocking other horses, as well as tactical riding to try to position a horse to take advantage of overtaking spaces.

The racing standards are supposed to be overseen by the appointed steward.  Make sure you're playing with friends as there may well be a controversial decision to be made which will not meet with universal approval!

Better than owning your own race horse, and a bit cheaper too. 
One of the more complete horse racing game out there.
The game is more focused on being a stable owner - that is both owning the horses which is you purchase via an auction. Trying to have to come in the money.
Like the racing mechanism how the horse have different characteristics - start early fade in the stretch vs distance runners. 
Wish they had included a larger selection of horses, I like how there has been some user adds for horses.

Wow, this is a surprisingly good game. This is what Knizia's Winner's Circle wants to be but never will. Simply put, WP&S actually feels like a horse racing and wagering game, while WC feels like a filler that overstays its welcome.

Major differences:

[1] In WP&S, you own your own horse. In WC, you simply choose any horse that hasn't moved yet in the current "round". This makes WC feel more "gamey" than WP&S.

[2] In both WP&S and WC, you have multiple races. However, WC feels much more repetitive than WP&S. It's because there is more horse "diversity" in WP&S than WC.

[3] Despite the fact that the length of the track in WP&S is much longer than WC (which means more time counting spaces) the races in WP&S feel like they move faster. It's because the kinds of decisions you make in WP&S (which lane to move the horse, do I slow down to land on a passing square) take less time to make than in WC (which horse to move) and hence, the game moves faster.

Solid racing game with excellent betting mechanics. Moves really quickly and has a good mix of strategy and luck. Some complaints from other players about movement being blocked outright--similar to Daytona 500 or Detroit Cleveland Grand Prix.

Go to the track, gamble on a horse or two, hope that you win.  You're given probably about the same amount of info that you would be given in real-life horse betting.  Probably not bad as a simulation (complicated odds calculations, strange bets possible, but all still contingent on a lot of luck), but since I don't care for horse racing to begin with, I don't care much for the game.

The bits are nice, particularly the race programs.  They have an appropriate old-timey feel.

For 1966 this is a decent race game.  For fans of horse betting this one maybe more for you as the bets are most central to this game.  While playing it, I was as overwhelmed with the odds and betting as I would have been at a real track.  My one major complaint is the disparity in which horse you control each turn...  they could have easily tied the color to the stables, but as is, it becomes very confusing, especial if you don't have the full compliment of 6 players.

Good game but possibly too long to hit the table often (took us about 2 hours to run the first 4 races after which we had to finish), plus the foul and daily double rules are awkward to get your head around. Probably best with 6 players to cut out the auction altogether.

I prefer this to Winner's Circle.

I LOVE this game, but none of the people I have introduced it to like it that much.

This goes into the same category as Bolide for me.  I LOVE it, but it is too long for people who don't love it as much as I do.  Consequently it rarely gets played.

Update:  Three more plays and still nobody loves this game like I do.

I stubbornly keep the rating at an 8 and will continue to enjoy this one solo.

The dice movement is really innovative and also makes it transparent how the horses odds are what they are. This allows you to get a pretty good idea of what needs to happen to win a longshot bet. 





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Nice horseracing game from the 60's. Purchase horses at auctions, then bet on and race them!
Party rules for >6 players, as well.

Great horse-racing game where you own, jockey, and bet on the horses.  Be ready to spend three hours playing, but plenty of fun and excitement if your crew can handle it.

If you like horse racing games I'm sure its a beauty first few plays.  Six races is too long for new players. Veteran players often just bid the minimum on every horse and bet conservatively or on the longshot and do well.  The game has a lot of complexity that seems to result in a false sense of freedom of choice in strategy.

A 3M Sports game. I've gotten to play some of this lately and am thoroughly surprised, it's more about the betting than the racing! Why shouldn't it be with a title like that? I've long wanted to try this game, and turns out I really like it!

Terrific game - a little more complex with scoring than I'd like, but it gives pure exhileration - and the races are a lot of fun!

I admire how this takes betting on horseracing and makes it into a very pure yet successful game. Still worthwhile even after 40 years.

A solid gambling game with several good elements to it.  Probably best to play only 3-4 races; 6 races takes a bit too long.  Winner's Circle is pretty much a strictly better version of this.

A complete blast to play.  There are a number of things to consider in placing your bet, but it never gets bogged down.  Open up a few beers with this one.  Definitely one of my favorites.

Suprisingly deep, fun game to break out with visiting family, even if the more casual race fans want to see the first horse crossing the finish line awarded the win.  And the 3M long-box version just looks great on a table...

Excellent racing and gambling game.  Takes a long time to play though. Happy to play 3 races any day but there is a danger I may get a little bored if more.

I choose to neither Place nor Show and instead opt to toss the game into the Grand Canyon.  That's because, having done that, we ALL win! Yay!

I hope I don't hit that poor burro on the canyon bottom, though. God knows I don't need another burro grudge.

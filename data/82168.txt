RATING: 4
There is a good game in here somewhere, in the potential of it being a cross between Letters from Whitechapel and Werewolf or something else I can't put my finger on at the moment. But it comes across as wildly unbalanced depending on what rules you go with. Either it's impossibly hard for the aliens to catch the humans in time, or impossibly hard to escape for the humans before the aliens get them. I would try it again, but my first game was ruined by some teammates who were not really interested in playing and sabotaged any possibility of a win.

RATING: 6.5
Turns Scotland Yard into a multi-player race, but without the board, quality components, or charm. There is a lot of randomness in the card-draw. Players can be eliminated - even if you win the race you can be sitting out for ages waiting for the others to finish. The components really aren't up to scratch for a published game (pen and paper where there could have been peg boards or some alternative; and where are the player screens). It all feels like it should be print-and-play. But it is quite a fun game. It needs fine-tuning.

I enjoyed playing this with six people. As the alien, it was fun to find and eliminate two of the humans. We listened to the "Alien" film soundtrack which added a lot to the theme. The variety of maps is cool.

Abstract:
A hidden movement game ala Scotland Yard. The alien team hunts the human team. The crux: all players move in secret (write location on paper). Humans must find the exit in a limited number of rounds.
Random event cards are drawn when you move on a grey tile that may force you to tell your location or bluff. Players can also fight each other.
The game comes with different maps for increased variety and replayability.

Thoughts:
Fun idea to create a hidden movement game in which movement is hidden for both sides. However, I am not a big fan of hidden movement games, but this game would be my favourite because it is easy, fast, and tense. However, I do not like the player elimimination. Moreover, you need at least 4 players to play the game.

RATING: 7
1st play: Hidden movement game reduced to a very straightforward form.  We didn't play with any of the add-on things, just the basic game.  The end result of who wins or who loses is weird but that doesn't really matter.  The fun is in the journey, either trying to suss out where the tasty humans are or trying to hide from the vicious aliens.  I like that it supports large player counts and it looks like there's a lot of replayability with all the different maps.

2nd play: Played with only 4 on a really small map and the game was over almost before it began.  One of the aliens killed each other and then one of the humans escaped.  I like the game - very distilled hidden movement game, with still more abilities and such for us to explore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It is a fun game with a lot of choices to do such as aliens or as humans. It is fun to try to run from aliens and to try to kill some humans, the mechanics are simple and very functional. The problem with this game is that almost nobody seems to have a clear victory, since if you are human and die you return as an alien, and if the aliens win in this condition, you don't feel like winning at all. The only way you really feels like winning is when you are human and escape.

Really enjoy this game, the theme is exciting.  The excitement comes when Alien are all around you and you need to run asap.  Each card you draw you do feel the tension too, because you really don't want to make a noise and if you do, you need to pretend you're lying.  Very fun game.

RATING: 6
A modern-day take on battleships, I guess. Hidden movement, hidden role. Requires some care to not accidentally look at an opponent's sheet and ruin the game. Likewise rules misunderstandings are nearly impossible to sort out due to the secrecy, even amongst team-mates.

However once you get everyone on board with the rules it's a fine fun game, although it can run on a little bit long for what it is.

The spiral-bound wipe-clean boards are a must. It's also one of the few games I've sleeved as the all-black cards mark easily on the edges and there's a huge deck to shuffle effectively.

My first play of EFTAIOS kinda fell flat, but the second attempt was much more successful. I ended up playing it three times in a row with a group of players and liked it a lot.

I've played three different maps and they all encouraged distinct play styles, so that's vital to the replayability of the game, in my opinion.

Looking forward to more plays.

+ I appreciate the lack of bullshit in this production. "You'll need a bunch of pencils, a small box, a small and clear rulebook and maps, period". For the first half of the game, it should be a very cool experience, with 5+ players.
- If you're killed, you'll be looking at the wall for the rest of the game (and it's not that short with many players). If you win, ditto. The random card draws can also ruin the experience, for either sides.

Hide and Seek where everyone is hidden!  I have the deluxe version with a bunch of dry erase markers that don't really work well, but upgrading the markers will fix that.  

The game itself is fun and tense with a couple of random elements thrown in that will either make the game super fun for you or incredibly frustrating.  That said, a single round is pretty quick to finish and there is a ton of variety in the box as far as maps and stuff. 

If you like hidden roles and and Scotland Yard type games it's worth a look.

I think it needs a bit of a tweak (my preferred one is that Aliens only move one space the turn after attacking) but it's a reasonable deduction/bluffing game.

This manages to feel a bit different from other games and the combination of hidden roles and hidden movement is fairly unique.  It is much more a hidden movement game than a hidden role game and as such I do think that there are prettier and better versions but with not knowing who anyone is and the humans not really being on each others side the game isnt slowed down by long discussions so that is a positive.  Happy to play it more but cannot see me ever rushing to play it.

Sort of a cross between Scotland Yard, Mister Jack and Bang. Players are either an Alien or a Human walking around on a stranded spaceship where all the lights have gone out. The goal of the aliens is to kill the humans, the goal of the humans is to escape. Since nobody knows who any of the other players are or where they are you have to deduce this from the clues left by the others. Each player moves in turn (writing down his new location) and draws a card which makes him either announce he made no sound (no clue), a sound (reveals his location) or a false sound (reveals a location anywhere on the board). Since the others don't know if the clue you give them is real or false they have to deduce your actual location from a series of moves. Quite fun but it can also be frustrating if you only draw real clue cards. Might be a more tactical game when players are selection cards from a small hand (2 or 3) of cards. As the game is now I find it interesting but too much luck based.

Super fun! This is a hidden movement, hidden identity game with essentially the theme of the "Alien" movies. Half the people are humans who are moving one space at a time desperately trying to get to an escape pod. The other half are aliens that can move one or two spaces at a time trying to attack spaces with humans in them to devour them and convert them to aliens. 

The most recent edition uses dry-erase notepads with all of the symbols explained on each map page. You write down the sector you moved to in the next numbered box. If it is a noisy sector (most of them) you must draw a card and based on the color you may be forced to say your location, allowed to say any location (to through off the trail), or forced to declare silence. The humans also have the potential to draw helpful items.

This game is akin to "battleship" meets "hide and seek", and I love it! Turns are tense and once the aliens start attacking zones the fear begins. I can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 7
Very interesting. This felt and looked like a game that could have been published in the '80s. The concept of writing your moves down on a sheet had a very retro feel.

And yet the gameplay was tense and pretty fast (although it felt a little longer than the 40 minutes it took us first time out).

Certainly an interesting opener.

RATING: 7
Escape from the Aliens is little deduction game of hidden identities and deceiving movements that succeeds in recreating a dense atmosphere of dread and danger aboard a wrecked starship: I like how it makes sure players can never take anything for granted, not even that the life capsule they’ve ony just reached is working indeed.

This game was very very good for how cheap it was (1.50 for PnP files). Sleeved it up with some magic cards, in reality though you could just play with a standard deck of cards. Really amazing what they fit into a pencil and paper game. Lots of laughs. Lots of tension. I look forward to exploring the advanced version of the game.

Edit: Love this freaking game. Brilliant pen and paper I will never turn down. So much with so little. Have enjoyed it even more now that I started building my own scenarios. Once we got the scenario tweaked the way we liked it, this became a group favorite.

Edit: Just received ultimate edition. Between this, the map editor and scenario generators online...I would rate it an 11 if I could. LOVE this game.

More data required. One game as an alien so far, and I enjoyed it... but it does feel a bit like floundering around until someone dies, sometimes (though I now realize it might be because I'm just bad at this game :P).

This game combines several things I don't really like, deduction, secret roles, and hidden movement, so it wasn't a big surprise I wasn't a fan of it. I just don't really like the note-taking required in these types of games trying to keep track of where everyone is/might be, and the hidden role part of these games never trips my trigger.

However, if you're a fan of this sort of thing, the game seems to do it quite well. Every once in a while, you'll get glimpses as to where the other players likely might be, and there's trickery to be done if you're a human that's trying to throw an alien off your trail. You also might pick up an item or two that lets you do some cool stuff.

At any rate, if you like this sort of game, you'll probably like it. If you don't, you probably won't. I'd still play along if others wanted to play, as it's pretty quick and harmless enough.

Next to Letters from Whitechapel, this game has provided the most tense experiences of my gaming life- even more so that Fury of Dracula. The premise is simple, the components are gorgeous, and the gameplay is fun. The new rule change where all humans who get eaten turn into Aliens leads to interesting scenarios where you could have 7 aliens hunting a single remaining human. That happened to me- I was hunted by 6 aliens, and managed to escape after they ate 2 of their own. My stomach was in knots through the entire game though.

This is a really fun game of hide-and-seek, but they're almost seems to be no point in keeping your identity a secret. The aliens show their true colors pretty damn quickly. Also, it really sucks as a human to only be able to move one space at a time. That is unless you have a special tool card but those are really hard to get to. I think the game really needs some tweaking to the rules, but it still is fun to play as it is.

This is OK. It seems that the designers assumed people would try to hide that they're aliens. Really, everyone is pretending /to be/ an alien because aliens don't want to eat other aliens, so it's a little off kilter because of it. If there were good reason for humans to try to move together there might be reason to pretend to be human, but as is pretending to be a human is setting yourself up for a death sentence. Also, the card draws make it way more random that it should be. I think it could use a re-work from the ground up. It's still OK to play, but not what it could be.

I love the concepts of this game, and we had a good time playing with a large group.  I think there is strategy to develop here, but even new players can enjoy themselves.

The component quality was good (particularly the cards). 

I may have a hard time getting a lot of play with this one, since The Resistance is kind of the game of choice in similar situations, and the playing time can run a bit too long if players are slow planning their moves.

But I give this high marks for originality, theme and fun-factor.

This has sort of fallen out of favor in our group for a few reasons. I think it's a game which probably needed more added to it. This is a game that could have realy been inspired with a campaign book. There is so much that could have been done here and after playing it quite a bit a lot of people really are looking for more meat. That said, there is no other game that has given me the eerie feeling of the movie Alien like this did. For that alone it gets a nine.

Good game in concept, but needs a lot of tweaking to make things balanced for 2 players. Still ridiculously addictive though.

This game is a nice filler. Although during the last time we played it became quite a challenge. The humans managed to arrive at 3 of the 4 escape hatches and in all cases it resulted in a broken escape pod. The last pod could only be reached by a going there in a straight line which made it too easy for the aliens to kill the last human (me :-().

Clever, concise design that produces a remarkably fun experience in a very short play time: it really does finish in 20 minutes.  Card draw chance can shorten or lengthen the game and there's definitely a luck element, but it's more about the experience than the strategy anyway.

I have not yet tried the advanced game.  It doesn't seem strictly necessary, though I'll probably try it eventually.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game in which EVERYONE is partaking in hidden movement. Half of you are humans trying to escape the spaceship in one of the few escape pods and the other half... well they're aliens trying to find you and rip your face off! Some sectors are safe to move into however some are dangerous sectors that make you draw a card, potentially giving away your location... or perhaps, the ability to completely throw someone off your scent. Aliens can move 1 or 2 spaces and humans may only move one space at a time. Made it to a hatch? Great! Oops... looks like it's malfunctioning! Try another! Great fun, can get thinky... I never know where everyone is. That's A LOT of keeping track of!!! Luckily the game comes with great dry-erase map books and markers (recommend getting ultra-fine tip expos however).

RATING: 9
This needs a very particular type of group, but is so very intense when executed correctly. Best played with a group that's capable and comfortable with holding back the banter for the duration of the game - turn off any music and dim the lights. A 'derelict spacecraft' SFX track would work fine too.

The tension of quietly walking the halls, hoping your misdirections are subtle enough that they're not clearly lies. You never know how close an Alien is, until you hear them attack the air only a few rooms away from you. Then you know you need to get moving immediately... but stumble in the attempt. You know it's only a few steps away...

Seriously, I love this game. This could easily be a perfect game for me if I had a group that was eager to play it frequently and really get into it!

RATING: 7
Played only with 2P so far and only base

Favorite quote from the wife: "Holy crap that's scary, how did get there so fast??"

I appreciated how the game's theme was able to show through even in a 2 player game. It was a bit difficult playing as the alien for me especially on the bigger maps. On the very first game, the wife was able to divert me away with some lies, but I finally pinpointed her location - even then and after 4 turns, I still wasn't able to get to her in time due to the size of the ship. 

Playing on the smaller ships however, the game ended in 3 turns with an escape!

We both enjoyed our plays so far with just 2 players but could see how it would definitely be more enjoyable with more people.

Going to try some variants where either there are 2 aliens vs 1 human or each controls an alien and a human and the escaping human player wins

This game has an incredible theme and is very intense. For the human, it's a race to escape the abandoned ship alive. Once attacked by one of the aliens, you become one yourself. So much strategy that every move is a guess. There are times when you have to call out your coordinates/location....but is it a bluf? Can you get out with your life and your sanity intact? This is a must-have for any sci-fi fan.

After seeing how well hidden identity games went in our group, I thought a hidden movement game would also be worth it and we've had a blast playing this!

I was pretty dubious of another hidden movement game, but this one is simple but effective. 
You have a designated start point dependant upon your hidden loyalty and movement is very simple, each hex being either silent, or dangerous. Each dangerous space you stop on forces you to draw a card which could be a special ability (humans only) or a noise. There are two types of noise, true and false, thus as the human you want to utilise noise effectively throwing the hunting aliens off your trail.

In both games we played a was an alien and I enjoyed hunting down the human snackrafices, however I wonder how different the game will feel as the hunted.

Very interesting premise, but unfortunately the game fails to convey the theme well: most of the thrill of uncertainty disapperars as soon as you know who's who, and by the end of the fourth turn you usually do. It is too easy to discover who the aliens are, and often they don't gain much by staying hidden.
Kudos for the artwork, though, it's really cool.

What a great game! Reminds me of Scotland Yard but everyone's hiding most of the time. Some players are the humans and they're trying to escape through the hatches, others are the aliens and they are trying to kill the human players, but at first you don't know who is who. 

We played the base game then immediately played it again, this time the Advanced Version (which we liked even better).

The new edition just got here and it looks wonderful! laminated notepads replace the previous sheets which I feared would run out, so I can play it forever! There is also more content in the form of more maps, characters and items.

This game ran the gamut of emotions. When I first read about it, I HAD to get it, something just sounded exciting about it.  When it showed up I ripped it open and dove right into the rules.  It just didn't seem all that great.  

It did look easy to teach and it was 'somewhat' different.  One of the groups 'go to' games for a late night laugh is [thing=1484][/thing].  This takes that based mechanic and spreads it to everyone.

So, We sat down and played.  It was easy in concept.  But, the cards aren't really easy to understand.  So, there was a lot of rule book reading just to keep the 'items' straight.  But, other then that it played relatively fast AND exciting.

aka. "alien barquitos"

Es un juego un tanto peculiar. no es malo, pero es eso... peculiar. 

Vio mesa las 2 primeras semanas despues de llegar... y no ha vuelto a ver mesa nunca mas. 

En mi opinion el fallo del juego es que requiere mucho esfuerzo por parte del jugador para meterse en la tematica, ya que el juego apenas aporta nada en ese sentido debido a su extrema parquedad en materiales. Al no meterte en la situacion no motiva mucho jugarlo, ya que aparte de la tematica, el juego en si es un "simple" "policias y ladrones" (con la peculiaridad de que en este caso el ladron es un alien que mata a los polis)

RATING: 6.5
A social deduction game with a fun theme that gets bogged down in attention to detail (normally not a bad thing). 2-8 players are running around a space station trying to escape the alien parasites, while half the group has already been infected and seeks to devour the other half. Each player (human or alien) has their own unique ability (hidden until played) to make each character special as they write down moves on a personal whiteboard with erasable ink, using playing cards to announce possible locations they've entered. Players can then declare which space they're attacking (if they're an alien - or a human with a weapon) and kill any other players in the same space (humans resurrect as aliens, aliens are removed from the game). It's fun, but has a high tendency to get annoying quickly as players lose track of each other, get eliminated, make mistakes (the propensity for human error in note-taking and recording is also high) and we found the markers ran dry very quickly. This is a game for people who love games like Mafia or Werewolf and want to take that experience to the next level, but I personally believe the market for such games is limited and niche, even amongst enthusiastic board gamers.

RATING: 6
Initial impression for this one far exceeded the second experience, but I far from hate it. You have to give this game credit for being deep enough for an enthusiast, yet approachable enough for a casual gamer. It is also extremely accessible, and just as playable with PnP and a clipboard lounging around the living room as it is with boxed components.

Gameplay is...unpredictable. While effective bluffing is essential, there are times when you are simply going to have to throw the dice and take a guess. Feast or famine. Draws can be make-or-break. There is little to stop you from accomplishing everything with a devastating combo or ability, or if you are allowed to lie on every move. In contrast, if you have to reveal every move, or have a role that has an ability that is painfully niche, well...

Its flaws give it a strange type of charm, though. With the right room and the right amount of alcohol, you will enjoy it (if you enjoy social deduction games).

I've always lived hidden movement games, and this one does it in a neat way mechanically.

The Osprey edition is also very nice.

Sometimes Escape can be intense, other times it's a frustrating blood bath that ends after a couple turns.

Still, Escape is a great light game to play on a rainy evening.

Beautiful mix of Whitechapel, The Resistance, and Battleship. Easy to learn fun party game for all levels of gamers.

I have my copy laminated and bought vis-a-vis for it, as well as print off the new released maps from the website every so often! So many endless possibilities to this game that it eventually becomes your own whether it's your own rules you add, your own maps you can create on the website, or how well you pimp out your set with laminations and card sleeves.

The obvious flaw is that people aren't always honest with their card draws, but still an incredibly balanced game for both sides. Sweat inducing for humans and anxiety attacks for aliens.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2013)

I have only played with the basic rules.

OK hide and seek game. At first it seemed the game was ultra-hard, I tried to deduce all the movements and that’s impossible. As the game progressed, I found it was, somewhat, easy to hunt down the humans. At the beginning, I liked the game, however I found the “luck of the draw” in the danger cards to be overpowering. Or you get a red card and you can´t bluff or you get a green card and you can bluff. There were sometimes a player really needed a green card but didn’t get one, making easy to target him next turn. If a player dies early on, the game can drag on for a while leaving him very bored. 

It seems a waste of effort to hide your role if you are an Alien, if you are revealed you can coordinate better the hunt for humans, if you are hidden, it only hinders your team and opens the possibility of friendly fire. 

The theme is awesome, my favorite theme, however that is not enough for me and I don’t feel it in the game.  On the good side, the game is very novel and I really like the concept, I only wish it was more fun to play with. I’m hoping the advanced rules fix this for me.

Bottom line, a decent game with lots of luck and player elimination. I would play again (as I love Hidden Role games) but I don’t think this will become a favorite of mine unless the advanced rules bring a lot to the table.

I finally played the game again, this time with the advanced rules, and I dislike it more than ever.

I played the new Ultimate edition that comes the erasable boards, that’s great! The best edition of the game by far! In that edition the rules came wrinkled though.

After all these years all the issues remain the same for me, except one. I never read the rules of the game before so I’m not sure if this has been always the case, but if you kill a human he become an alien, so there is no player elimination (unless you kill an alien). Other than that the issues remain the same, namely:

1.	There is no motivation for the alien players to stay hidden, perhaps there is some personal satisfaction if you trick the gullible humans, but it is much better to reveal yourself early and then plan with the other aliens how to best hunt for humans. Staying hidden makes no sense.
2.	There is way too much luck of the draw in dangerous sectors, either you can bluff or not, but if you can´t you will get killed soon. Aliens move much more quickly than a human.
3.	With the new rule (or perhaps my friend forgot to teach it last time) that human players become aliens, there is no motivation for them to play their best, if a human get killed he becomes part of the winning team!

The game is much harder for humans, but that’s not a negative to me although reaching an escape pod and finding it is damaged has to be frustrating to the player, this rule is also managed by dumb luck.

I like the powers and the items, but that’s not enough for me to like the game. 

It is very easy to cheat unintentional or intentionally.

Bottom line, it seems the game has tremendous potential, but the gameplay is boring and repetitive, Alien payers have no motivation to stay hidden and luck of the draw is way too much. It is a shame but I will be selling this game.

RATING: 9
- My game group and I have had so much fun with this game. This has become a bit of a go to game when we have 6-8.
- I think I prefer 7 players as we've house-ruled it so we don't know the number of humans/aliens for odd players (i.e. could be 3 or 4). This makes it even more interesting as the aliens don't know how many aliens/humans there are.
- Playing this game invokes so many feelings. For example, as a human in the beginning you soon feel like aliens are all around you. Then you build a bit of confidence as you break free and things are looking up. But then they're on you again, and you're 2-3 turns away from an escape pod stressing bullets. No other game really compares to this. The Resistance sometimes gets close, but it's nowhere near as fun as this. 
- The various maps really help to keep this fresh, but I wish there was more. Maybe even some other modules that could be added in. Expansion please?

2016-10-09 - This is a pretty interesting take on hidden movement. I like that everyone is moving secretly, but it does necessarily introduce some randomness in the form of the cards that may or may not force you to reveal your location (but are you telling the truth?). I've only played it one time, but I really enjoyed it. I'm not crazy about the player elimination, though.

Everyone is given a dry erase pen and a notebook for tracking your own movement and notes on others' movements. Everyone gets a secret identity that is either human or alien. Every human and alien has a unique ability, which mixes things up a bit. Humans move slowly across a grid to get to an escape pod while the aliens try to pinpoint their position in order to attack and turn them into aliens (the alien is actually a disease). There are safe hexes (where nothing is announced) and there are danger hexes where you have to draw a card. Depending on the card, the person either has to name their exact location, a fake location, or announce silence. Some silence cards are also items that humans can use.

With the right audience, the game is filled with tension and intrigue as everyone figures out where everyone else is and decides whether they are a threat. For some reason my group had initial trouble getting their heads around it, even though there aren't many rules. Once they were settled, everyone enjoyed it. It's really more of an involved party game than anything else. The ultimate edition is very good, durable, and worth picking up over the PnP.

Played with 6 and it definitely lasted way longer than the 20 minutes list time especially with broken hatches and all.

There's a hint of an interesting experience here where the game environment largely exists in each player's imagination, but in practice it seemed to fail. The nice big cloud of initial uncertainty gradually breaks up into a number of unrelated second-guessing exercises.

Aliens play together against the humans, but each human plays only for themselves. There's every possibility that a human will make a beeline for an exit and win because they only ended up giving up their real position once or twice and no alien happened to go in that direction.

Humans and aliens have completely different needs with regards to recording information on the map, yet everyone's somehow supposed to be doing the same things in order not to give away their identities.

Nothing about the beginner's map says "research facility"; it would make more sense to change the theme to a nebula where gas clouds are ignited by passing spaceships.

Perhaps most troubling, I can't see any reason for the aliens to ever stay hidden, removing a large part of what you'd think would be the game's main idea.

Wanted to like this more, but from one game I wasn't convinced by the random card-pull aspect making bluffing easier for the luckier players, particularly when the human strategy just seems to be "keep track of a second fake path, call it when possible and hope to draw 50% bluff cards". Keen to try it again, though.

06-04-2014 - After one play I have hope for this game, but it's not in my top 10.  Probably not in my top 20.  It was interesting and I think it could be tweaked with some slight rule changes perhaps, I actually think playing with fewer players might help, small map I think would help, etc.  Things like that.  Or maybe it was just an intro game I played and I don't know what I'm talking about.  Just seemed entirely too hard for the aliens and way too easy for the humans.  Will try again.  6 for now, and that might be generous, but again, I think there's a good game here.  Just have to find it.

FOR TRADE  - 11-11-2014 - Reluctantly putting this one up for trade.  I liked it well enough to give it another shot, but my group wasn't feeling it.  Thus I'm not sure it'll ever get that second shot.  For potential traders, the game has been played once and so has all but one of the paper maps in the pad available.

First impression after 2 plays, one with basic and one with advanced rules.  Battleship meets Aliens.  Said like this is sounds dryer than it actually is, the game is actually fun to play.  The team based hide and seek is exciting and thematic.  The rules are easy to teach and remember, and the game length is just right, the game does not overstay its welcome.  The player elimination is less than ideal but at least in my experience everyone continued to have a good time even later in the game.  Other hide and seek may be better, but this one is unique in that using teams and not revealing the player roles from the start, so it has its own place in a collection.

I taught it to gamers and nongamers with the starting sentence or: take battleship's concept and shoot some fun into it

You can try to exclude rules to make it harder on the humans but soooo not needed.
Rules are easy to grasp and screw with to fit your group.  I have started putting together some more rules to keep the tense feeling up and it a bit easier on the humans.

I found it very useful to have a person calling out the turns to keep people moving and on the same page.

I'm a fan of this game, it may not often fit many gamer's mood but its different enough from most to be a nice change of pace even if its not the right fit.

The hype machine strikes again, will I EVER freaking learn?  This is an entertaining game - but only in the sense that we we poked fun at the game throughout, with repeated cries of "You sunk my battle ship!" because yes, this bears a striking resemblance to the Battleship game of my childhood.  I wasn't entertained then, I'm not entertained now.

Unsure about this game. Have played twice and it doesn't quite feel balanced. Feel like I might just not be into the swing of it yet so will keep trying and maybe revisit score/review. Cards are beautiful but hard to handle as a result of the mostly matt finish, and the wipe clean books are clever but hard to use to shield from others - binding along the other edge might have been better, or little fold out card screens (which we ended up mocking up ourselves).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game delivers exactly what I wanted it to: A stripped down version of the movie Alien with easily accessible rules, delicious tension around the table, and a nice break from most other kinds of games. In our first game, I was the only surviving human out of three (and four aliens), and won; I and the alien players both said it felt hard from our end, so that seems about right.

I've only tried the basic game, which was a ton of fun. The map sheets work well, but need to be larger to allow for more annotation; I marked some sectors three times in the course of one game, and would have loved room for more than initials and a turn number (like a note for "Did they attack?" or "Do I think they're lying?"). Printing them on 8.5x11 paper seems like a good solution.

Despite the somewhat silly name, this is a game unlike any other I've played. It fills the party niche in terms of weight and, to a large extent, length, but it's manifestly not a party game. Love the tension, love the artwork.

RATING: 8
Needs a fair amount of house rules to be fun (but then it is!). So far we have decided not to play with the broken pod card and avoid the player abilities which seem superfluous and confusing rather than fun.We have also had to decide on some of the rules amongst ourselves, since the rulebook is pretty vague at times. Best hidden movement game I've tried.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on 7 players.

Traded.

I really botched the rules explanation for this one, and it fell pretty flat... but even with proper rules, we all seemed to have some issues with the game (eg. it feels like there should be some sort of mild penalty for a failed attack). It also might be that this is simply a game that relies on theme too much for me to get into. I still like the general idea of this game, and I think a few houserules would fix a lot of my problems with it, but who knows when I will be able to play it again.

I was looking forward to this deduction game, but I felt it was a bit too chaotic. In my 6 player game it just seemed like there was so much information to keep track of that you couldn't really focus and figure out where anyone was. It was also hard to record all of the things I felt would be good to record. It started to get more fun near the end when there were less players and I could focus more on my opponents.

This is a great cat and mouse game where some players as humans try to hide and escape from the other players who play vicious hungry aliens trying to eat them. There is no board, just complete darkness as you try to locate your opponents in the dark and either catch or avoid them. It incorporates both Hidden Roles and Hidden Movement really well, and has a whole bevy of maps and play options to keep the game fresh. 

The biggest problem with the game is that player elimination can happen -- aliens can get eliminated. Fortunately, the games don't take too long unless you have a full eight players, so it's not that big an issue.

The game is not for everyone, though! While the actual rules are very simple, some people simply don't have the knack for this kind of game, and they will usually hate the game, so you'll need to get a good group for it.

Hidden role deductive sci-fi horror game, resmniscient of Bang!, but a fair amount more strategic.  This can be a real "brain burner" with a table full of players staring silently at their maps for extended periods of time.  Quite a bit of fun, but it worries me that in the advanced game a human player with 2 hours of optimal strategy can lose the game with a single turn of a hatch card (50%) despite slaying all the alien players.  What's up with that?

Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space feels largely like Battle Ship made right. You play either a human trying to reach the escape pods in the corners or an alien trying to kill the humans. Movements work like in Battle Ship with random cards sometimes causing noise that give other players clues and sometimes useful objects. Nevertheless, it remains a guessing game and player elimination lowers the rating.

Out of all the games I own, this is one of the most atmospheric, tense, and memorable.  So tense that my wife won't play it due to how stressed out she gets.  Everyone wants to see everyone else's maps at the end and discuss how the game played out.

All of this from a small box consisting of some cards, paper maps, and a few pencils.  Awesome.  The only thing keeping me from ranking it higher is that it has player elimination, which I hate.

RATING: 5
A very quick-playing 2-8 player bluffing, hidden roles, and hidden movement game.

Best played more like a party game, it unfortunately falls apart as soon as you try to take it seriously and develop any real strategy while playing. This is mostly due to the fact that the aliens have no compelling reason to try to bluff anyone and are better off coordinating their tactics openly with their teammates. Meanwhile, the only truly viable strategy for the humans is to simply dash towards the nearest open escape pod and hope it isn't broken.

All-in-all, a fun game to play with a larger number of people in a light-hearted (or somewhat inebriated) environment, but clearly not for more serious or strategically-minded players.

Everyone plays on their own secret map, recording their moves Scotland Yard style. People are secretly aliens or humans, but the game-play means it's pretty obvious who's who within the first few turns so the insta-attraction to that concept quickly disappears. Everyone starts near the middle of the map. The humans are trying to get to one of the corners of the map. The aliens are trying to land on a human and devour them before the get to a corner and escape, or before 39 turns are up. Some spaces are safe, lots aren't. When you plot yourself onto an unsafe space, you draw a card and if it's red you must declare where you are, if it's green you can call out any space. But the aliens don't know if it's green or red, there's an honour system in place (with the plotting as well obviously) so they need to hone in on anywhere you nominate and then try and guess where you've gone next, same as Scotland Yard detectives do. If you're human, you need to ideally plot two different tracks - one where you really are and a realistic track that the aliens can believe and waste turns trying to land on you over there. Then, here comes the kicker, you spend many, many turns getting to a corner to turn over the escape card only to find the friggin' thing is a dud and now you need to get all the way across the board safely to get to another corner (probably just to find that one's another #@$#@in' dud). Major, major, major fun loss for everyone, dragging it out like that ... aka design flaw. So it's frustrating for the aliens because their turns turn out to be pretty much random stabs in the dark. In effect, once the initial gloss of plotting trails is over, it's repetitive and not that exciting. The attraction is the theme, but the theme isn't carried into the game unfortunately.

A very cool mechanic, you have a map and start as either a human or alien and then move around the board.

I won't forget this game session soon. It was a bad ending to a very nice gaming day. I got eliminated in round 4 and then I could watch the game proceed for nearly 16 more rounds. Maybe I should have lied.

You are either an alien or human. Humans try to escape from a starting room to an escape hatch. Aliens try to eat humans. All creatures move over a nicely paper map from space to space. In most of the spaces you have to draw a card. The card may say nothing, alarm or false alarm. If you draw an alarm you have to say the location you are. On a false alarm you may lie about your location.
I drew two alarms in a row.

I can see the game can have a lot of tension. But then I prefer The Resistance.

Escape is a great experience, but not necessarily a good GAME.
An amazing mindgame emerges between players, and there is absolutely no other game in the world that can reproduce the same sense of sheer desperate paranoid panic...
...However everything in the game is dictated almost exclusively by luck of the draw.  Even just attempting to end the game has a 1 in 5 chance to fail and completely hose you.

If you're looking for an exciting 40 minutes of sweat inducing hilarity, this is it!   
If you were looking for a thoughtful game... look elsewhere.

2016: 7, after 1 play.  I remember reading someone's negative review about this game, where they were eliminated from play very early on and then sat around watching their friends play the game for 45 mins, waiting for it to end.

That put me off for a long time, but I thought the game's design was so unique, and the art so evocative, that when the ultimate edition came up, I got a copy.

Played it for the first time tonight, 5 players (2 alien, 3 human)...and I was eliminated within the first 7 moves. :P  And I felt very bored waiting for others to finish.

Everybody still enjoyed it though!  So it will get back to the table.  I think the game needs the right people and the right kind of night; the game is *very* quiet!  I think I'll also have to pack a 2-3 player filler game to go along with "Escape..." so eliminated players can do something else while they wait.

May look into some fan maps, something a little smaller than the starter map.

Simple but fun.

A team of humans tries to escape a space station while a team of aliens attempts to suss out their location and stop them.

Hidden movement games are always a tricky balancing act and this one does it well. I would suggest sticking to the basic game. The additions in the advanced game, player powers and items, aren't as interesting as they seem on paper and really increase the randomness at play.

A bit of a logic puzzle is involved but it's mostly luck, guessing when players are lying about their location or telling the truth.

Clever, minimalistic game of hunters and hunted. The number of variants included makes it somewhat difficult to talk about "the" rules -- the upside is that the system can simulate a variety of different human vs alien scenarios, and can be tweaked for different audiences. If player elimination must be avoided, the Infection variant is a good one, at some cost to atmosphere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Weird game for me.  I hate a bunch of the design decisions, and it really feels like luck plays a much more crucial role than I'd like.  The fact that you can get to the end, and you basically just have a 1 in 5 chance to lose is just madness to me.  To get caught is fun.  To just lose by a random card draw is completely unsatisfying.  Why doesn't every game have this?  Let's do a die roll at the end of every theme-y game to see if a different person won!

On the other hand, I really like the tense hide and seek gameplay, and I'm looking forward to my next game of this.  It'll be interesting to see how long it takes for the frustration over poor design decisions to overwhelm my enthusiasm for playing pen and paper Marco Polo.  At that point my rating might plummet, but for now I'll play some more.  We didn't play with items, so I gotta check those out.  We also didn't have anyone straight eliminated, so we'll have to see how that goes.

I recently played the game without items on the "easy" map. I'm not quite sure how well the game would have gone had I not accidentally handed out three human cards and one alien card, but I got a good enough feel for the game to know it can be quite slow and plodding in the wrong group but a right good time with sufficiently suspicious folks. Rather like the Resistance, it is a simple-to-teach party game that can be as light-hearted or intense as the group dynamic allows it to be. As such, like the Resistance, it can be difficult to justify the purchase due to the simplicity of the components and gameplay--especially with the EFTAIOS asking price at $30-$40 for about 10 games' worth of paper maps, a deck of cards and some few pencils. But the game has some delightful minimalist artwork on said deck of cards and, again, flexes nicely to both the size and the demeanor of the group.

Had one (funny!) game of this at the full 8 player compliment. I was an alien and found the deduction VERY difficult. Consequently i blundered around attacking random sectors until I got lucky and ate the last remaining crew member for an alien win! All but one player enjoyed the experience and want to play again. Not sure if it's a keeper yet, I'll see how I feel about it after another play or two.....

Okay, so it might be just about impossible for the humans to win, but this is still a lot of fun. The items are variably useful and pretty situational, but it's a nice balance between speed and stealth for both groups.

Update: With an uneven number of players, I think it is much more even, perhaps even tilted in favour of the humans.

RATING: 6
Good with the basic rules. Very good with the advanced rules. Good tension, especially if you're a human. Does secret movement well, and seems to scale well. Eschews extraneous fluff and concentrates on quick gameplay. Some people I play with really dislike the player elimination. I'd like to try either a smaller board or one of the variations that removes player elimination.

More than player elimination, what I find must frustrating is how uneven the game plays from map to map, and even from session to session. Sometimes player elimination is a bear, with one player being eliminated in the first few turns. While this isn't always a problem, it can be if the rest of the game lasts another 45 minutes. Some maps last 10 minutes and some last 60 -- and sometimes maps that usually play fast, play slow. And it's just really tough to know ahead of time, or to get a consistent play-time.

So the game works great when it works, but the inconsistency is a problem.

This game has a really cool concept.  There are humans and there are aliens, but you don't know who is on which team.  There is a map and each turn the humans can move one space and the aliens can move two spaces.  When you move, you draw a card (but nobody else sees it) that determines what you have to announce to the group.  If you draw a white card, you don't have to say anyway.  If you draw a red card, you have to announce your actual location.  If you draw a green card, you can announce any location.  But whether you draw a red or a green, nobody knows if you are telling the truth.  Aliens try to kill the humans by landing on their spot and attacking.  Humans try to make it to the escape pods.

So it's a cool concept of bluffing and deduction.  However, so much comes down to luck of the draw.  If you are a human and you only draw red cards (which happened to me one game), there is nothing you can do.  You can't bluff, and it's just a matter of time before an alien eats you.  If you only draw green cards (which happened to a human when I was an alien), there is literally nothing anyone can do to find you.  I played twice, and both times one human escaped because they drew 0 or 1 red cards the entire game.  Great concept, way too much luck.  I'll pass.

RATING: 5
Pretty neat game. There are a number of issues, but if taken as an "experience" rather than a strategic endeavor the game can be fun.

One of the issues is with the game end. It's likely that there could be just one loser, which is a little odd.

The random card draw to escape seems like a bit much. I'm considering just not playing with that rule, and having a human successfully escape if he makes it to a pod. It's quite a feat just to survive long enough to make it to an escape pod, so randomly drawing a card that essentially says "you lose the game" at that point is just kind of sucky.

There are also some strategic problems. At a higher player count, it would be best for a human to just run into the aliens and get himself killed in order to increase the odds of winning (killed humans become aliens, and win if the aliens win). As an alien, it seems like it would be best to start attacking right away so that your fellow aliens know that you're on their side and they won't accidentally attack you. This seems to be against the spirit of the "stay hidden and sneak around" gameplay, though. I try to urge players to not do those things which is why I consider this more of an experience game.

Issues aside, it can be pretty fun because of the unique "everybody's hidden" aspect.

Sold.

I really wanted to be excited by this game. I've wanted a hidden movement title in my collection for some time.

Unfortunately there was so little player interaction and it felt like you had so little control over the game itself.

On top of that, the best strategy as a human seems to be to die as soon as possible so the Alien side's victory is easier and you can cash in there.

Still searching for that great hidden movement game...

I thought I was really going to like the concept of this game. But it took a very long time to play and there was a lot of waiting around in this game. The larger player count is terrible. There's some confusion on the cards for people but I do tend to like hidden movement games. I think if I played with the right people for this game I would have a good time. But that will rarely ever happen in this game. Also, they have a variant that seals off escape pods if someone get's into one. That is a terrible mechanic when another person has to literally change their whole game plan and go to the other side of the grid to get to another pod. Just too frustrating to keep in my collection.

About [thing=82168][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=82168][/thing] is a hidden movement game  in which humans are trying to flee an alien spaceship. In order to do so they must go to the escape pods without being found and killed, while the aliens are actively tracking them down. The spaceship has plenty of places to hide, however, some security is in place, meaning that some of the information given about the position of the players is, actually, true - and some are just plain lies.

[thing=82168]Escape from the Aliens[/thing] pits players in a claustrophobic environment, not only because of the small size of a few scenarios, but also because it is hard to know who is who, maybe until is too late. Aliens have more freedom of movement (because of their bodies or because they know the ship), but the humans have more tricks in their sleeves and can really mess up the aliens chase. The rules are on the easy side: though there are several unique abilities and items, a single person will only need to care to a few of them, and everything is explained clearly in the notepads.

The production value is good: the box is on the flimsy side, and the cards are OK; but the notepads are really well done.

Replay value is high: not only the random nature of the cards make for different plays, even in the same scenario (from the distribution of the teams to the cards drawn while moving), but, as mentioned, the game comes with several different scenarios, going from small and quick, to big and demanding longer to finish. 

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Cards, randomly assigned, form the teams: aliens and humans, and also tells the unique ability of each person. The goal for the humans is to escape; for the aliens is to find the humans and catch them.

The teams start in different places in the ship. Humans move 1 space at a time; aliens move up to 2. Every movement must be called: if moving to a white space, the player says "silence in all sectors", and her turn is done; if moving to a gray space, the player draws a movement card, and accordingly to the color of the card she announces something:
- if white, she says "silence in all sectors" (but players know she drew a card, meaning she moved into a gray space);
- if green, she must say a place in the board that, supposedly, she is in. However, when drawing a green card, she can lie and say anywhere she wants (even her actual place);
- if red, she must tell the truth about the place she just moved in.

Movements are recorded in the notepad - the players can try to keep track of the trail of the others. If an alien moves into a place she thinks a human is, she can call for an attack. If the place is empty, nothing happens, except that everyone now knows that this person is an alien. If there is a human in spot, she is taken and turned into an alien - in the next turn of the captured human, she will start as an alien. If there is an alien in the area, she is killed and the player is out of the game. In both cases, the alien that killed someone, now is stronger, and can move up to 3 spaces - three is the limit, regardless of how many humans/aliens the alien kills.

When a humans reaches an area adjacent to a escape pod, in her next turn she can try to flee: there is a 5 in 6 chance that she will be able to use the pod - if the 1 in 6 happens, she is out of luck and must find another way out. When a human uses a pod or it is broken/absent, the same escape route can't be used by other humans, which means the humans must spread out in order to have a better chance of escaping - however, they can't really discuss that or make a plan about who will go to where.

The victory for the humans, while they are in the same team, is individual. The aliens have a full win if none of the humans escaped - if at least one did, the victory is more in the satisfaction of killing as many as possible.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Where to move. Of course, the most relevant - be to remain hidden, risk detection or go after the kill;
- When to use the unique abilities/items. Most are one-off, and can be key to catching a prey or to escape;
- When attack. Normally just for aliens (is possible to have a human with the ability of attacking). Tends to be just a matter of getting it right: wasting an attack is bad mostly because it shows exactly where you are and that you belong in the alien team.

These are mostly it. Not hard at all - the biggest difficulty I found in the game isn't a decision: is to keep track of the movement of the others.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great notepads - very useful and nice to keep track of information and keep secrecy;
- Easy to play and to teach (for the most part);
- Can hold up to 6 players;
- High replay value;
- Has scenarios for shorter and longer plays;
- Good amount of interaction.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- For some (me) is truly hard to keep track of all the other movements - sometimes I was playing basically at random, just trying to be around when someone called a given place;
- Has player elimination;
- There is plenty of luck (or lack of) in the drawing of cards, which can, indeed, decide the play.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in the film Predator - if it happened in a spaceship. There are invisible aliens chasing the humans: you can't see them until they reveal themselves to attack, likely just showing a red triangular mark on you before blowing you up. However, the aliens are locked in a sort of ritual hunt, and will kill other aliens, mostly by accident - but, maybe, out of spite, to confirm her superiority, alpha status or they are simply stupid - who knows (stupidity is the right answer). Humans and aliens commnunicate by shouts - "I'm in N7! Anyone around? I'm hungry!" - the aliens may use clicks or howls, but the message is the same. Or maybe there are cameras, that the humans learned how to hack with the help of inmate JFFGLDBLM - so both sides can see when the others pop in a corner or coridor.

[thing=82168]Escape from the Aliens[/thing] is a much less involved and, well, even serious hidden movement than [thing=59959][/thing] and [thing=181279][/thing] - and it isn't as elegant and tense as the first, nor is such a big hunt, filled with special encounters, fights and powers that one finds in the second. [thing=82168]Escape from the Aliens[/thing] is simpler than both, being also normally faster and, maybe, more "fun" for those than want a game with easier resolution, one that doesn't demand the level of thought and coordination that the other two have. Is almost an everyone for themselves type of deal. [thing=82168]Escape from the Aliens[/thing] works fine enough to be enjoyable, but it doesn't reach the heights of greatness I found in Letters and Fury, likely due to the individual nature of it. In the end, I would play it again, but won't seek it out.

El mapa de una nave, los humanos salen de una casilla y los aliens de otra, movimientos en secreto, si vas por zona segura nada, si vas por zona peligrosa cada vez que te muevas sacas carta de ruido, si es roja tienes quie declarar tu posicion verdadera y si es verde puedes farolear. Si en las cartas de ruido te sale signo de caja coges item, que puedes tener como maximo 3. Los aliens se mueven de 1 a 2, y hasta 3 si ya se han comido a alguien, los humanos 1. Cuando llegas a la salida robas carta y puede ser salida buena o mala.Divertido, aunque descompensado para los aliens.

An interesting idea, and it's not bad in execution, but lacks a certain something. With the right combination of map and extra scenario rules, it might get good, but I would prefer that the designers figure this out in advance.

The Ultimate edition includes some fairly drastic rules changes that ultimately work. Core of the game is still great, if a bit fragile. The equivalent of playing tag in a dark room, lots of fun.

One game, Essen 2010, basic rules with no item cards or damaged escape hatches. Amusement all around when I, an alien, was torn apart by one of my fellow aliens within the first few turns.  I like the idea of the game and the card art, but find the hex-grids unattractive and wish there was some more elegant way of tracking movement.

Definitely need to play some more, neat to see a hidden movement game that takes under 30 minutes, and for so many players.  I feel like I missed out on half of the game since I never drew a silent card.

Rather interesting game, but need to print a lot of maps, cause that, what are in game box - for very limtied plays.
I like moments, when you can kill accidentally your mate-alien.

I really, really wanted to like this game. The concept is original, and the basic idea is good. However, the gameplay falls really flat. It is extremely likely that one or more players will be eliminated near the start of the game and will have nothing to do for the remaining playing time. Moreover, the luck of the draw with the noise cards is very (too much?) high. A disappointment.

Given that I don't really enjoy games like Scotland Yard, Escape is an enjoyable group experience.  

I'm not entirely sure how balanced it is.  Our game quickly ended in favor of the aliens.  But, I don't know if that was the norm or atypical.

If you are a human, you are scared the aliens are going to get you.  If you are an alien, you are feverishly trying to kill the humans before they escape.  The problem is you don't even know who is who at the beginning of the game, so trying to figure out when someone is lying or telling the truth about their location becomes a very tense experience.

A good group game. Best in my opinion with all 8 players. I like the hidden movement and plotting on the secret maps. Fairly easy to teach. Escaping as a human is hard. It is nice that there is no elimination. Players captured return as aliens.

Fun hidden movement game that can be highly dependent on random card draws.  A bad string of draws can force you to reveal your position (though other players don't know if you're bluffing or telling the truth) and a good string can make it so you don't have to say anything.  Then, even if you get to a pod, there's a card that blows it up so you have to get to another one.  Might irritate some, but makes the ending quite intense.

This applies to the Game 2 - the bastard child of Struggle of Empires. Bloody awful board which has lost the charming clarity of the MB edition and no longer sits on a normal sized table. We chose this because we wanted a big non-elimination game to play for 6 people. Half way through the first campaign season most of us dearly wished it was an elimination game. Have rated this a 3 because I will never likely play it again - I would always choose between Struggle of Empires or the MB 1984 edition of CotE.

2 versiones I: Es como un "risk". II: tipo "Struggle of Empires" mas corto. Mega-tableraco del mediterráneo. Juego de estrategia en el Imperio romano de adquisición de influencias para ser el próximo sucesor del Cesar. Gestión de provincias, pequeño politiqueo, y lucha militar. Tienes en cada turno 2 acciones, a elegir entre un total de 8 disponibles, con lo cual tienes que saber elegirlas muy bien. Las miniaturas de plástico grandes, esta chulas, aunque el juego por ello parece muy militar y complicado, pero luego es más sencillo de lo que aparenta, incluso decepciona a jugones. Mejor para 4 o 6 jugadores.

Too little to do for a game that lasts for hours. Immediately after the game you think that you won't play this ever again but after a few days you already want a rematch - next year. Next time I'll bring my lunchbox along.

First off, the Conquest of the Empire looks absolutely gorgeous when laid on the table. With its big board and heaps of components all covered with details you are filled with an urge to play. Just make sure you have a table big enough, since the board is huge.

During the game you get to roll a lot of dice and, although, a single battle could be decided by a lucky roll, over the course of the game the sheer number of dice you roll is enough to mitigate the impact. So it all boils down to management of probability, as it should be with games in which dice constitute a major decisive mechanic. However, the management of economy and the cards bring more subtle flavours to the game, so it is not all about rolling dice.

The first hour is full of excitement when there is not so much going on at the board and turns flow fast. However, soon when the contest for conquest truly begins, players start to agonise more over their decisions since the option space has expanded tremendously through expanded territory and more units move. Moreover there will be more conflict which takes longer to solve. In other words, more and more of the table time is spent on waiting.

After the fifth hour you start think that this is not a bad game but it just takes too long, or more accurately, too much time is spent on waiting. Faithfully, you sit through the rest of the game and wonder if you will play this ever again.

This is very much a first impression after playing only once (with the Martin Wallace rules), but I liked it very much.  Similar to SoE - but not too similar, and great fun, too.  After a second look, it lost a bit, but we'll see how it goes from there.

Very high production values: Great mounted board.  The artwork on the cards looks very good, and the bits are some of the very best.
I like a lot of the game play functions, such as bidding to determine allies and turn order.  Getting only 2 actions is painful in a good way, as you cannot move, battle, and convert influence.  At the same time, that limits combat a little more than it should (why would you spend your turn destroying your opponent, only to see your opponent convert his influence?)
But the best part of the game is the shifting allies.  Will they cover your back?  What happens the next turn when your ally is now your enemy?  That part is rich.
Also, the combat system is slick for a simplified wargame: reverse Memoir.  You roll X number of dice (not adjusted for range, but you match the symbols for what you BRING to the fight.  Dice are base 3, but you have to have [i]at least[/i] 3 units to score 3 hits, and is adjusted based on leadership, cities (defensive modifier), and training.  Not perfect, but it works very well.  This isn't trying to be a highly detailed game.
Probably an 8 on gameplay, but pulled down a notch because game play is very long (about 4 hrs for 6 players).

RATING: 7
Un juego bélico tipo Risk cuyas acciones políticas y alianzas cambiantes cada año, le hacen superar a éste por mucho. Más ágil que Twilight Empire, pero es debido a su mayor simplicidad y menor cantidad de reglas. Aún y así, divertido, aunque hay que tener cuidado con los jugadores más rencorosos.

RATING: 9
Juego épico de guerra y política en el imperio romano. Tiene uno de los tableros más grandes y bonitos que he visto, con cientos de miniaturas y componentes increíbles. Además son 2 juegos en 1, ya que contiene un reglamento para jugar una especie de "Risk avanzado". Y aunque no es un juego totalmente temático (no es el Republic of Rome) tiene su saborcillo histórico...
Tengo que decir que Struggle of Empires (el juego en que se basa Conquest of the Empire) quizá sea algo mejor (hasta 7 jugadores, muy rejugable, etc), pero teniendo en cuenta el aspecto impresionante que tiene este juego, y el hecho de que contiene 2 juegos en 1 (y además está en español) para mí se merece claramente un 9.
-------------------------------------------
This game is a blast. An epic game of war and politics on the roman empire. It has one of the biggest and most beautiful boards that I've ever seen, with hundreds of minis and wonderful bits.
It's also 2 games in 1, as it has a rulebook that allows you to play some kind of "advanced Risk". It has to be noted that it's not a full thematic game (it's not Republic of Rome), but it has its chrome though.
As a sidenote, I know that maybe Struggle of Empires (the game on which Conquest of the Empire is based on) is a slightly better game (up to 7 players, more playability, etc) but due to how amazing this games looks, and the fact that it contains 2 games into 1 (and also that it's in spanish) for me it clearly deserves a 9.

Game has good theme play.  Some good game mechanics such as bidding for alliances, voting in the Senate, and influencing control over provinces.  These mechanics are similar to 'Struggle of Empires'.  However, the combat system is lackluster and there aren't enough critical provinces to fight over.  Game also suffers from a lack of a 'catch-up' mechanism.  Every turn seemed like there was too much to do and not enough actions to do them in - led to some analysis paralysis and downtime. Game play was meh.  The components are excellent except for the rulebook which was unclear on many items.  Played the original variant - the wargame variant.  Very 'dicey' combat.  Again play was nothing to write home about.

RATING: 9
Rating for version II of the rules, as I have not played enough of version I to make a meaningful comment. 

Version II, however, makes for a delightful back and forth as players vie for power and position. There are multiple paths to victory, and things can shift suddenly. There is conflict, but your military serves as a means to an end, rather than an end in and of itself. 

You're always left trying to fit in so much, but with limited actions you just don't have the time. It leads to wonderful choices, gambles, hedges, etc. 

This is a great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The size of this thing is a beast. The board is so massive it actually is a negative point considering how much space on the map generally goes unused. 

I like the basic alliance system and territory control VP system that this shares with Struggle of Empires. In some ways, the CotE II game is just a streamlined SoE. But on the other hand the dice combat/movement system is meh. And I'm not sure I like how ridiculously powerful controlling Italia is (lots of points + getting a senator card from every winning Senate vote bid). It dictates the whole game in way that is frustrating.

I enjoyed exploring Conquest. But I remember liking the balance of SoE's dynamics a lot more.

Great game. Straightforward, fast-playing rules with lots of variety in the cards and in the approaches you can take. Love the alliance mechanism.

My first four players game, after rules and setup played 1 hour per turn (so 5 hours)-- I think 6p might be pretty long, I think 4 could be ideal. Also works well with two pairs in each alliance each turn.

Definitely want to play again.

For the COTE II Rules:

I thought this game was ok, but the movement was very abstract and confusing and weird how in one turn you can be attacked by an army the started on the other side of the board from you. I do like that allies are constantly changing. This is from one play and may go up or down after another play.

Well... even with the Struggle of the Empire variant with this game, I don't think I'll ever want to play the game again.  The alliance auction is pretty cool, but the multiplayer problems still exist.  Being an aggressor just opens you up for opportunistic moves by your opponents, albeit, it is a bit harder in this game.  But still, I don't like this kind of effect that happens in multiplayer games.  With 6 players it took us 5 hours.  I just don't like these kinds of games.  I feel like I am at anyone's mercy and just always choked.  The game is pretty fun for a multiplayer wargame, but it is just way too long for me to play again.  I enjoyed myself but I would rather play other games.  This is not a bad game, just not my type.  I think 6 is the highest rating I can ever give a multiplayer wargame.  Additionaly, the map is just huge.  Just like Railroad Tycoon, so much of the map is not used.  At the same time, you cannot place your pieces on those dead zones because people can still use that place if they choose to.

Had our first play with the advanced rules, think we are still missing the idea. For now the fight seemed to be concentrated in the key provinces. Transportation is interesting too, where you can move troops magically as long as you have ships linking the two provinces together regardless of how far apart they are.

Generally a good game (only played the Wallace version) with a good system. Because moving and attacking are two actions is it sometimes a bit too slow. The system of alliances is very nice, because sometimes we spend a lot of money to be in the right alliance.

An update of one of the Game Master series games by Milton Bradley.  This is one of the games that got me hooked on board gaming.

RATING: 3
Played once using the rules based on Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires.  Overall, I enjoyed myself, but why would I consider playing CotE when SoE is far superior? 

Before playing CotE, I assumed that it would be a clone of SoE.  Well, I was sort of correct for CotE is area control with the same alliance system as SoE.  However, the movement rules for CotE feels waaay more chaotic than SoE.  For example your movement in SoE is limited to 2 troops per action.  In CotE not only can you move an unlimited number of troops in one action, you can also move then across several continents, much like a RISK troop march!  I found this really silly, especially since it was far easier to travel large distances by land than by sea.  What?

The other chaotic element, besides the dice, was the card drafting.  In SoE, all of the tiles are available for purchase, wheareas in CotE, only a few are available per round.  This makes for a more chaotic game.  However, on a positive note, I did like how the Senate Voting and Alliance bidding was based heavily on the upcoming cards to be drafted, so the system does work... it just feels more chaotic than SoE.

Not as good as Struggle of Empires. Movement is easier, no automatic loss of reaching high levels of unrest, lots of provinces are not used. Additionally its a much bigger box with plastic pieces, which may appeal to some but just seems like a bulky and inferior version of the original. I do like the historical period though, the use of leaders, and the voting.

A caveat or two is in order to reflect my concerns over the final design.

One, all those neat mini's take up a LOT of board space, even if it is an Eagle board.  It gets bothersome to move 20+ units into an area that is already crowded.

Two, I fail to fathom why so many areas have no victory point/resource value.  Other than the areas that border, or lead directly to, the vp zones, these areas are a virtual write-off as far as game play goes.  But they are still a part of that massive board; in terms of the board, we paid money for what?

Three, if it wasn't for a) the heavy (and acknowledge credit) use of the rules from Struggle of Empires, and b) the dice combat system that lifts it above RISK, we would have a "1" on our hands, albiet, a pretty heavy "1".

Four, how can so much thought be put into certain aspects, while other aspects seem to reflect something akin to a comatose state in terms of design?

A very good surprise, i was not expecting to be that pleased by this game. We've done a game with the rule for an advanced game, and the game plays very well. I think I had pass a better time to play this game than fief or games of throne.
The game is less chaotic than fief but more than GOT.
The alliance mechanism is very cool, you will be with somebody but this personn can change during the game. At the beginning of each round, a bid will be done to determine all the alliance.

Raised rating to a '8.5', but I don't think it will rise much higher than that due to length and difficulty finding people to play.

The original MB version I'd rate as a 4
This one, CotE1 is the slightly revised version and I like it for simple Ameritrash fun.  Gets a 6 on that basis, though it does kind of drag at the end, probably smarter to just call it and start a new game
Read the rules to the CotE2 version, which is a Martin Wallace Eurogame and it sounded boring, have not played it.  May some day, it certainly seems like with all those activities going on there would be some strategy to it.  But probably not good for solo

WOW! I was blown away when I opened the box. Everything is of the highest quality from the pieces to the dice to the markers...even the box is covered with a nice, textured linen paper. Eagle went above and beyond with the production, and I'm kind of surprised the price stayed at $60.00. Struggle of Empires was one of the best games I ever played, so I'm expecting this to be just as enjoyable and even more so thanks to the amazing quality of the board and bits. Limiting the action cards to shorten the playing time is a good idea in my opinion, since some of the main negative comments about SoE was the 3-4 hour length.

Eagle Games presents another Map That Ate the Table.  I wish they had come up with a game that used more of the board instead of the key provinces, but this is still a really fun game.

After two plays. Once again, Eagle shines in the lavish production department. In addition to going over the top with a reissue and fix of the MB GameMaster title, they give players a huge ~4'x3' map and enough bits to please a miniatures gamer. The basic game is a lot of fun on its own, but the game comes alive in the advanced version. The auction for alliances is an effective way saddle a leader with trailing players. My only complaint with the game is that the rulebooks could do with some illustrated examples of play.

Need to play a few more times to be sure what I think of this but the massive board may preclude that happening soon.  If I had do-overs I'd probably get Struggle of Empires instead.  It seems like the main things that make this game more attractive than Struggle (giant board and loads of minis) also make it harder to play.  I will probably replace the minis with more manageable dice armies for future plays.

RATING: 7
The advanced version is a weaker version of Struggle of Empires. Still decently fun, but nowhere near as tense as the grown-up version. All the changes diminish the value of the game, making it go from brilliant euro-ameritrash hybrid to above-average ameritrash. Lavish production, but at the end there are so many pieces on the map that it hurts visualization. For this purpose, chits end up being better.

In order to get influences and conquer Rome, you have to be very slippery. You have to know who is your really enemy among your enemies. Alliance can be changed for the next round going. The problem is you're binded to the alliance and cannot break it, meaning no backstabbing, but....watch your back because somehow it is still possible. This game is about war after the fall of Caesar in Rome, every players shall gain influences and conquer as many as possible every areas in Mediterania, the winner of the game will be determined with victory points. 
Using classic rule the winner will be determined as the last player standing.

A nice re-implementation of a classic. I played this for the first time at Origins 2007, and it was thoroughly enjoyable; actually, one of the most memorable games I played there. It really takes the 1984 original to the next level (and also allows play of the original version a much larger and cool-man map). The game design and components are top notch.

Adquirido en el V encuentro Nacional de juegos de mesa, en Amorebieta (Nov 2009). De forma gratuita por un gasto de 100€ conjunto entre Marc, Pedro y yo. Fue el gran descubrimiento de las jornadas.

Es de Eaglegames, los mismos que publicaron el Napoleon in Europe. Este es de fecha posterior y se nota que las reglas estan muy elaboradas. El juego es muy elegante y tiene unas cuantas mecánicas muy atractivas. Similar al grande en cuanto al tema de dominar territorios, pero con el saborcillo de un wargame. Incluye además cartas y votaciones.  Lo dicho: Es un juego que me encanta. Admite hasta 6 jugadores.

Eso sí, requiere un espacio grande de juego y unas cuantas horas (cuatro o cinco puede estar bien). El juego permite jugar con los componentes dos modalidades. Nosotros solo hemos probado la versión II, que ha aparecido nueva en la reedición del juego clásico. Por lo visto (no lo he probado) el clásico es un risk avanzado.

El 25/10/2010 me aclaró Pedro que el juego le pertenece a él. Por algún motivo pensaba que el juego había sido para mí. En fin, lo saco de mi colección y lo pongo como prev.owned (aunque permanece en mi casa)

Based on the new rules.

Nicely over-produced. A box full of great plastic figures. The map is way too large to fit on most people's tables at home.

Unfortunately, there are many better and/or shorter choices for this type of game. And if you want to commit hours, then bypass this mediocre substitute and go straight to Struggle of Empires.

Give me Antike/Mare Nostrum/Risk over this. This game was a real bust at our game club.

I think the original game is fun (with the Italian start variant). The new version with the alliance system has some very deep flaws in it though: 1) lack of interesting geography as it has all become pretty much abstracted 2) lack of useful things to do with your two actions - can only take one card and can't fight every turn or you'll wipe out 3) lack of interesting things to do 4) cities seem like an afterthought 5) money is super tight but no real penalties for borrowing other than the tax-like loss of a few points.  But you might as well borrow a bunch whenever you have nothing better to do because of problems 2,3,4, and 5.

Played this twice, and reached the same conclusion: the mechanics do not jive with the boring, abstract, tacked-on, Roman civil war theme. Even the minifigs that came with the game were awful. This game, unfortunately, put me off trying Struggle of Empires for some time. I bought SoE due to a chance find at a great price in an Autralian games shop. SoE is very good (I gave it a 9). But, CotE is a load of crap. It's an abomination that shouldn't have been allowed past the idea stage. I'm surprised Martin Wallace allowed CotE to adopt SoE rules. I very much regret trying out CotE before having played SoE first.

I'm always baffled when people heap tons of praise upon Eagle Games' boards. To me, they're way too busy with distracting doodles, waste too much space and remind me more of circus posters than maps... In short, I consider them poor taste with their over-the-top bombastic opulence. I wish the artist would show more restraint. First wondered if it's an American thingie, but then these days there are plenty of Yanks with exquisite taste. Just not these guys, one might have to conclude. 

Railroad Tycoon at least seems to be going into the right direction. Well, to each his own...

Gigantic board, typical of Eagle, that doesn't seem to quite work with the advanced game. Only 11 regions score and the others remain empty except for the odd sentry or barbarian horde card. Units can move pretty much anywhere on land. The miniatures have small bases and players need a ton of them so they have an annoying tendency to all fall over whenever anyone looks in their direction. The rules, like most Wallace games, are also unclear and need an FAQ. I like the Senate Vote cards but the special rules surrounding the voting make anyone who takes control of Italia a prime target. Once they are down, they are as good as out as there is no catch up mechanic. Those with more influence markers will get more talents, so can afford more units to take more influence markers.... Also, why have talents and VPs go up in increments of 5? There are many elements of Struggle of Empires used here but Struggle is the superior game by far. This is a clunker.

This classic is an easy-to-play light strategy game.  It is set in the era of the Roman Empire's decline, and plays like a modified game of Axis and Allies.  The Eagle Games Edition is truly epic in size, with a massive gameboard and substantial unit figurines.

Well, I have to say that this game sure doesn't live up to the expectations that are invariably garnered from the combination of a HUGE production and the promise of "Struggle of Empires set in Rome".  Some of the added elements (such as the politics, the general/caesar command requirement and the Attack!-derived combat system) are rickety and artificial-feeling and the tightness and economy of SoE is lost in a flabby system that just isn't as good a game as its predecessor.  Overall, the game feels terribly bloated and overblown but nonetheless it's a fun play that does have more immediacy than SoE, making it much more accessible to "common" gamers.  The revamped "Classic" CoE rules are nice, but the new version is still a better, more interesting game.  I have to hate on the art...I've heard how "great" the art is so I'm in the minority, but I think Paul Niemeyer's art is absolutely horrendous, overshaded, and amateurish.  Why there's a Merman with _two_ tridents in the middle of the board is anybody's guess.

Initial impression after 2 plays of Classic and 1 play of Advanced CotE. (rating 6)

The game is actually two very different games in the same package (rating +1). Unfortunately,  the board looks quite awful and is not functional: some areas are too small, units are too large but  there is a LOT of unused space. (rating -1). The CotE has an interesting combat mechanic that favors infantry heavy but mixed units armies  (rating +1). Rules for both games are not well presented and are ambigous on certain important issues (rating -1). The winning condition for the classic game - elimination of all other players - is incredibly stupid. (Elimination in  2005, did they think at all when reimplementing the game?!!) (rating -3). Nonetheless, the classic game can be quite enjoyable if you can agree at an alternative victory condition.

CotE is a very smooth, fun dice & combat game.  More rewarding than Risk, and more engaging than Axis & Allies which might seem a bit 'scripted' in comparison (although I like that too).

RATING: 4
Note: I've only played the rules based on Struggle of Empires, so I'm ignoring the other rules for now.
This Martin Wallace remake doesn't fare quite as well as the AoS->RRT remake. The main problems I have are:
1) The map just feels weird. It feels too big for the number of territories that actually matter. Over half the territories are ghost towns. In a post-mortem, some folks in our group surmised that maybe we should be using them to clog the long travel lanes, but it still feels weird to me. Especially all the territories on the north side of the map which are all empty.
2) From reading the rules, I thought I would like the combat. I was wrong. Always throwing three dice is ridiculous. People complained about the luck in Struggle of Empires. This takes it to a while new level. True, there is a new emphasis on combined arms, but it didn't do that much for me.
3) Vote cards are priced. I will concede that I could be wrong after only one play, but that's the impression I got.
I'll certainly play again--in fact I'd really like to--but I'd be hard pressed to claim this is better than SoE.

Minor improvements of the map, along fixes to the play balance. Huge map, is ruined by having large playing pieces which crowds the board. Much improved combat system, mared by a lack of historical feel to the indivual units. The advance rules are quite welcome, but still has no historical feel when it comes to battles, except naval, which shines due to the limited number of rounds and the viciousness of them. All in all a grand improvement, but it could have been better.

This rating is for the Martin Wallace rules, which I think are considerably more enjoyable than the other rules. The overall feeling I have about this game is that it goes on a bit too long, and the rules don't feel quite polished enough. I don't mind playing it when other folks want to, but it's not a game I would purchase. While there is no denying that the components are great quality, the amount of wasted space on the board continues to annoy me since the board almost completely fills our gaming table.

Rating based on CotE2: An excellent game that encompasses much more than just fighting.  The alliance auction is the best thing to happen to multi-player wargames since the 6-sided die (said with only a little bit of tongue planted in cheek).  I'd only recommend playing with 5 or 6 players.

RATING: 5
The 2nd edition rules are a noble attempt at something a little different in the genre. (Don't even bother with the 'classic' rules - they're no more complicated than the 2nd ed and a lot less interesting.) Ultimately, however, I'm not convinced that the payoff for the time invested is worth the cost. This is a long way from a terrible game, but hardly a classic either. Generally in this genre I'll most likely play either Mare Nostrum (with expansion) or Antike in preference, depending on my mood and the time available. On another note, I generally quite like big boards but this one has so much wasted (unused) space on it one can't help but wonder why the publishers bothered...

Conquest II (the Struggle of Empires rules) is fantastic.  One of the most tense games I've played, you're on the edge of your seat the entire time.

Wow! Looks great, and Eagle finally got a clue and provided the miniatures already off the sprues and bagged, saving me several painful hours of snipping bits! I will rate once we play, but I'm sure it will be a winner, based on my liking of the original COTE and the rules changes made with this version. 

Update - after two playings - this is a truly great game! Eagle took the original and made it much better. The new combat system is a revelation - the catapult is no longer a freak super-weapon, and infantry again rules the ancient world! All units perform in historically valid ways, and retreat/pursuit rules are sweet. All in all, the best Eagle effort yet!

I liked this game even more than I thought. I had expected a more war-like play but I founc it has a lot of resource management. You have to be careful to manage your money, your units, your cards, your senate votes and your actions keeping always in mind the cost benefit factor for all of them.

The movement factor can be easily understimated in this context. If a player spends one of their actions to move land units, they can virtually transfer their units to anywhere in the map. Nevertheless, this can be easily negated by placing small units (just one figure will do) in key regions of the board to block the moving player forcing thir units to stop and fight.

I found the combat mechanism interesting, as it leads you to purchase different types of units in order to have more chances of victory. It can be argued that it is a inbalanced because even a weaker unit can make a lot of damage to a much stronger opponent but I find this good because, combined with the actions system, makes it quite expensive to win. 

A military-oriented strategy will not give you many influence points and will cost you too many actions, money and chaos points which will not give you benefits in the long term towards your victory points.

One thing I did not find so elegant is that that towards the end of the game it can become a "Caesar roadshow for influence points". A player can move his Caesar around to grab his Caesar around the empire without any accompanying units to grab influence points without fear of retaliation. 

In my game, this did not really affect the final result but it was not kind of "realistic" (so to speak) to see the black Caesar in Italy all alone surrounded by yellow legions and buying influence points.

One thing I liked is that a player can never be eliminated. Their Caesar can never be eliminated and they can always raise special taxes and try to improve their position. 

On the other hand, this game can lend itself a bit too easily to a situation in which it is too clear who is going to win in the mid-game.

In this situation, some players will not enjoy playing "not to be the last one" and might try to play just to negate victory points to the leader or might want to play the "kingmaker" in order to have an influence on who is the winner or just try actions which do not have an immediate benefit for them just to see how it plays.

Not everybody will like this type of end-game situations but for me, managing other player's psychologies is also part of any game (otherwise I would play only PC games).

In addition, you can control other players actions in different ways: the "murder" card can render all the player's units in one region totally unplayable until a new general is moved to that region, the alliance system can put your wors enemy on your side preventing them from attacking you and cleverly placed units can block the movement very easily.

There are many parts of the board which were not played in our game, as they did not give many resources but, thinking about it now, we could have made better use of them to negate other players' movements.

All in all, the game allows the player for a very different number of means to win the game. In the end, you need to control influence points in Italy or in the "external" provinces but this can be done in different ways.

I want to play it more to explore the different possibilities of this game.

The "classic" rules offers a rather vanilla conquest game that needs at least four players to work in any capacity.

1-Play so far - Really enjoyable strategy game (played via the Martin Wallace rule set). Quite dynamic but not chaotically so, and many strategies could lead to victory. The alliance bit is a really good mechanic. It does suffer a little bit from the problem of all mutli-player wargames in that launching major attacks is discouraged as the attrition for winner and loser will leave them vulnerable to the non-participants. How much this surfaces can only be judged over several games.

It also played a tad long (4-player, 4 campaign seasons went to 5 hours. A repeat play would knock an hour off that and there is the option to only play 4 campaign seasons - I'm not sure I'd want to play with 5 or 6 due to the added play time and down-time between turns.

Really like the mechanic of bidding for new partnerships each year. Military might is important, but the real key to victory is winning influences in key provinces. Due to the limited number of actions, a military only strategy is certain to fail. This is another reason I really like the game.

Played CoE II once and enjoyed it.  Better than Struggle of Empires.  Uses cards instead of tiles and fewer come out at a time.  So you don't have to spend 10 minutes trying to figure so many options.  Also combat is a lot better.  There are different type units which match faces on the dice.  Resolution vastly improved.  Downside is the huge board..but I suppose it is necessary given all the cool mini's.

I love the original Conquest of the Empire. This updated version is great also. The larger pieces are very cool to use. 

Although the game comes with "Classic" rules, these are not the same as the original rules, and not what I had imagined to be the fix for the original game either. This is really a "New" Conquest of the Empire to me. I like both sets of rules though. I'd play any version of this game if I could get other players together for it. The biggest downfall to this game, in my opinion, is that it takes such a long time to play.

RATING: 7
The v1 game is similar to Risk and/or Axis and Allies, with battles being the main event. The v2 game adds many more elements, with battles being very risky and costly. Both are good, and each played in about 3.5 hours. My rating on this game will likely go up as our group becomes comfortable with the rules.

Edit July 2012 - Dropping this from 9 to 7. In the V2 game, it seems that the person who holds the most influence in Italy will win. There's a lot to like in this game, but if you don't get into Italy, it is unlikely you will win.

Played "old" Conquest about a dozen times.  First time I played I lost because I thought I was moving one of my generals into battle, but it was actually my Caesar.  I have not lost since then, but many games did break up before they finished and I have not played serious gamers.  Highly bizarre gameplay encouraged because you can "win" by sacrificing entire legions of men to take out one or two opponent catapults, which you can then "buy back" (really steal) at the end of your turn.  One of my favorite gaming moments:  "Marty, don't fuck with the Dalian!!!"

I will re-rate this game after I play the new rule set at least twice.

This is a game where you can destroy other people and become friends with the senate, or both. Conquest of the Empire simulates history from Roman times. By simulating, I mean you get to tax the $hit out of your own people, as well as sending more troops into battle. The sad thing is that the game doesn't have magical creatures. In conclusion this game is as fun as watching Battlestar Galactica.

My level of enthusiasm for Conquest of the Empire is two levels higher than I had anticipated. The rules revision for the original game is absolutely superb. CotE is 100% more playable and fun than the original. As for the addition of the Martin Wallace CotE II rules? I have decided I like them better than Struggle of the Empires.... which I like a whole bunch.

You want two of the neatest games on the market? Then get this one. You want insanely cool toy factor? Get this game. You want a huge colorful board that is complemented by everything else in the box? This is the one.

If you're a dry, humorless Euro-Snoot who looks down your nose at anything that involves dice or chance... go back to your GIPF game... there's nothing here for you.

I bought this game because my wife and I were getting a bit bored playing classic Risk and I thought she might like something with a similar area control feel but with a different theme.  Unfortunately, the rules for this game are not very clear and we ran into an issue that is still in debate on BGG so it has not come out since. I think the game has a lot of potential but I need to play it again with more players to see if it is worth keeping.

Not as good as Struggle of Empires. The original game, with its Risk-like rules, has its supporters and detractors. All depends if you're into Risk-type games, which I'm not. The Wallace rules are supposed to give the game a different dimension, and it does work, to an extent, giving the game a deep strategy. However, the grafting of the SoE rules to CotE did create some jarring effects during the game. The unlimited troop movement on land was just weird. There was also a lot of wasted space on the board which would never be contested. The combat system simply encourages an arms race as you need a big army to take on a small army, since the small army dealt the same amount of casualties as a big army. And with SoE, you get several broad trends in strategy like Europe or Colonies. But in CotE, there's only the Italia strategy, because the benefits of occupying that province overshadows anything else on the board. Thus, if I want to play a game with SoE rules, I'd rather play SoE.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Fixes several problems with Struggles of Empires:
1) Random cards instead of the complete set of fixed tiles in SoE. Prevents solving the game and gives replayability. Good move.
2) Attack the leader. It'll take a strategy and more than 1 turn to randomly attack people.  Good move.
3) Way better bits & board
4) Better dice mechanic.
Sadly though, it's still just alright. Kingmaking, of course, is my bane.

Relatively low downtime, and a great theme, but it's strange that vast swathes of the map (in CotE II) are completely unused.  Limiting the actions to 2 really helps keep things moving, but the fact that moving, grabbing influence and attacking are separate actions creates some frustrating situations.

Other than the theme, there's really no reason to play this instead of Struggle of Empires.

My experience with this game (COTE II) tend to indicate that despite a solid core design (from [gameid=9625]), there are far too many problems introduced by other elements (not having the full choice of developments, for example).

I think perhaps Eagle should have worked with this a little bit more before releasing it; but it's too late for that now...

This Review is for CotE-II

I'm a wargamer, and I like strategy games involving resource allocation.  That's why it's unfortunate that I did not really like CotE-II.

My friends and I constantly felt like we were being shortchanged on the fun factor during all of our rounds.  There was never enough resources or action points to really form a grand "Stomp your opponent into the ground" plan.  The most common statement made during our first play was, "If only I had one more action..."

Now I understand that many people would say that the limited resources and APs lend to the challenge of the game and I'll agree to that.  The game did present it's challenges, it just wasn't any fun trying to overcome the them.

Maybe the original ruleset will be different.

One of these days I'll buy an old version and frame the box art because it really is that awesome.

This may be a bit harsh a score, but I just wasn't impressed.  I looked forward to playing this for two reasons.  I owned the original as a child, and I heard it was also getting a Martin Wallace reworking to be similar to Struggles.  Well, where as Railroad Tycoon worked for me as a friendlier more accessible Age of Steam, Conquest failed miserably.  This game seemed long, random, and never compelled anyone at the table to care.  Granted little things might have been mis-played here or there but quite soon this game transformed  into a tour of caesars.  I sat down for a war game, fueled by nostalgia, and felt I got a pride parade.

In short, CotE 2 takes all the great things about big, epic multi-player games and cuts out everything that makes them suck. It is the ultimate refinement of this genre. If you are drawn to that type of game (which I am, like a moth to a flame) but tend to be impatient with all of their failings (which most people who have been spoiled by Euros are) then this is the game that will scratch the itch.

I have played the game several times with 2 players, but only with my single, simple variant to add the alliance auction back into the 2-player game. It can be found here, with explanation:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/174761/2-player-cote-ii-with-an-alliance-auction

With the variant, I'd rate the 2P game a 8 as well.

I play the CotE II rules. This game is certainly fun but I like "Stuggle of Empires" better. The table space this one takes up is enormous.  When 6 players are going at it, I've got to have all my dinner trays in action.  I'm not able to put my finger on exactly why I like SoE better. It may be that all the tiles are available at once, combat is quicker (but I like the CoEII mechanic), taking money is more costly and having large military is more costly. It's fine hairs I splitting in any case. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Includes a wondrous map that is obscenely large, with very nice minis. It's probably one of the most overproduced games I've ever seen. Only played the basic game (Classic). Quite entertaining- feeling a bit like one from the Gamemaster series, or one of many Risk descendants- but not as good as Ikusa/Samurai Swords. Nothing too complex, just area control, dice rolling battling. 

Update: Struggle of Empires makes the COTE II version of this game unnecessary.

Ikusa & Axis & Allies (as well as other dudes on a map games) make the Classic version of this game unnecessary.

In addition- Mare Nostrum Empires scratches a similar itch, but includes trading & diplomacy as well. The biggest draw to CotE are the minis and huge map. My biggest beef with the map, is that most units by game's end converge on the tiny area of Italy, leaving most of the board unused. And if one overlooks the minis, there simply are better games to play today, as this is mostly a relic of the past.

a good roman empire period reproduction. you can either play the conquest mode that put's you in charge of a faction trying to take up the power to rule the empire. you will protect your Cesar(that represents the player himself) while trying to kill the other's Cesars. the second mode that is more deep than the previous, is a political and influence struggle with the war and battles used to disrupt and make other players loose power while acquiring it all for yourself. best with at least 3/4 players, chaotic with more, maybe a little too simple with less
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm a big fan of ancient history and the Roman Empire is one of my favorite time periods.  Lots of that theme in this game, but definitely requires that you read and understand the rules before you start playing.  CotE plays in two modes.  'Classic' mode is faster paced and is very similar to Risk with added varying components (i.e., ships and catapults) while 'II' mode also adds politics and intrigue to the game.  'Classic' provides an fun solo or kid friendly experience since nothing is hidden from players, but serious wargammers should perhaps only bother with 'II' (although with 'II' I speculate that there is a balance issue in favor of the player controlling Italy).  Two games for the price of one!

Certainly this is better than risk, however it still lacks any balancing mechanism of any kind and suffers from runneraway leader problem in many areas.  Limited to 2 actions between rounds means you can't do very much without helping other players more than youself and thus long term tactical planning is of little use.  merchants can be far too powerful, one person can make as much money in 0 actions as all the other players in one turn!Games takes far too long for the limited level of strategy it allows.  I would suggest Antike as a superior type of game (albeit with less combat)

I play mostly CoT2. The game has some fun aspects that are bogged down by its movement system. I enjoy the game, but it doesn't get much play time when competing with other titles. It's a great value, though. I can't think of a game you get more out of for 25$

The rating is based on the advanced game. It's horrible.  The only thing keeping me from giving it a 1 is the quality of the product.

RATING: 5
I don't get the appeal of this one.  My friends all love it, but they are much more interested in the Roman theme.  Perhaps that helps?  We've played both classic and advanced several times, and I didn't think the advanced improved anything.  In fact, it's a totally different game.  I didn't read the rules, so it's possible the owner (new to him) didn't have it down correctly.

Okay: Strategic - Ancients - Easy 

Always longed for the original and finally I got it. There are actually 2 games; the original and the 'advanced'.The simple version is a non complex military slaughter. This is for the ones who are tired of risk and like simplicity and nice bits. 

The advanced version is far nicer with events, politcal, economic and military components; Similar as in Struggle of Empires.

Few gripes: 
1) With four player the near east player has little chance if Hispania and Macedonia are allies. He simply misses the economic bases to resist for a longer period of time.
2)The dice system....cavalry costs twice as much as infantry and is only half as effective. The ideal legion (one general) is one horse, one katapult and 4 infantry. 
3)It took ages to build cities. The cost / benefit is simply not there. 
4)Did I mention the size of the game......
The quality is excellent but the size of the board and the units are just ridiculous, sorry.

See my review for further comments.

Revisited: not played for a long time and no desire to.

This is not as good as Struggle of Empires, but since it is in print whereas SoE is not, it's a reasonable substitute. The alliance system is identical, and that's good, but the units are more diverse and that's not so good. Still a solid game.

I prefer Struggle of empires over this, but I like the combat system and the retheming. For the struggle-like game, the board is way too big, an annoyance. Rating might change after playing the other game.
edit:
I am not sure anymore; this or Struggle of Empires? Conquest theme and pieces are better, except for the ridiculously huge Conquest board.  Combat and move rules are better in Conquests, developments and alliances are better in Struggle.
As for the classic rules, I really do not care and do not take them into account in my rating.

RATING: 3
Tried the advanced game and really did not like it.  Perhaps we are playing this wrong, but with armies being able to move all over the place in a single move, who needs navies?  No fun factor here.

The base game is an adaptation of RISK.

On the positive side, the board and components are nice, as are the cards for CotEII.

I have only played the original version (the new version looks like it might be more interesting).  I don't plan to play the original version again as it seems to me to boil down to who does the best job forming an alliance on one of their fronts and dice rolling.  In short, not enough payoff for the time and energy that it takes to play.

A slightly more involved Risk! clone, with a smaller scope of territories and an interesting "leader" dynamic.  The alliances system is weak, the chaos system doesn't affect gameplay NEARLY enough, movement is too generous, and the ability to turtle is too great.  All in all, the game NEEDS the roads rules from the first game to balance it and make it plausible again.

RATING: 6
Martin Wallace rules: Effectively this is Struggle of Empires moved to a European map, but the small number of scoring provinces makes much of that map meaningless, while the 'roll for hits' battle mechanism is much more random than 'roll 2d6 and take the difference' in SoE. Multi-player wargames are very hard to design and even with alliances this doesn't do enough to overcome the arbitraryness of who gets picked on. Stick to SoE.

This game is great!!  We played a 2 player game the 1st night and it was fun.  The next day we played a 3 player and 4 player game (using the CotE 2 rules), both very exciting.  One of the things that I like about the CotE2 rules is that the game ends at a set time, so it does not drag on.

2nd Edition Rules:

I give the game a very solid 6, but a 6 nonetheless.  The movement is just wacky and combined with the two actions a turn, some really strange and fantastically unrealistic things can happen.  Perhaps the thing I find the most offsetting is the fact that the game is confrontational in nearly every regard.  While I like a lot of dressed up Risk type games (such as War of the Ring or TI:3), this one is done in a style so as to really bring out the worst in people.  Gaming should be competitive and it should be fun.  However when a game turns into a session of pulling teeth because everyone starts getting a bit ornery, I call the game right there.  With that said, I think the game has a lot of good in it but the bizarre movement rules, constantly and basically randomly changing alliances, and supped up Risk rules make the game more of a miss for me than a hit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great quality components and box, interesting game (both versions), but rules could have been organized better. CotE2 borders on being too complicated for light wargamers due to so many things to remember (rules are hard to learn). Classic CotE appears to be just another Risk variant (haven't played it yet). Having two very different games sharing the same board/components is a cool idea.

Jan10:

Well, that was epic.  It's everything you think it will be.  RailRoad Tycoon was a loosening of Age of Steam.  This is a loosening of Struggle of Empires.  Yes, it is exactly the same feel with Glen Drover re-imaging Martin Wallace.  It's still good, but I wish they'd had a developer to step in and tighten some stuff up.


Does it take a long time?  Yes.  Mainly just because there is tons of stuff.  And then some.

The points are all El Grande style majorities.  There are some from votes, and the other votes break things up, but more of it is El Grande style.  And your guys actually aren't your "cubes" in the important regions.  Instead, your guys just protect your influece.

So really, there's a whole lot of stuff moving around that doesn't *really* matter.  What really matters is having area majorities.  Oh, and Rome.  At least half the players need to fight over Rome or the player who wins Rome will win the game.

The alliance auction is fascinating.

But really, just not enough going on for it's length.  I played El Grande the week before and had more interesting decisions in half the time.

A fascinating game to play.

I'm not sure what Eagle was thinking with this one. I thought it was supposed to be a shortened version of Struggle of Empires which plays up to 4hrs. Sadly after 1 full turn it was clear that this game would take 6hrs to complete. Coupled with the fact the mechanics didn't mesh together well, this game just ended up being a giant waste of time. Sure the combat system is pretty cool and the political element of the gam eis interesting, but neither of them work with the original Area Control element of Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires. The combat system would have been good for a wargame and even if tweaked slightly it might have worked in this game, but the way it was presented it just didn't work. Also I could even see the important information on the board because the figures were in the way. Playtesting while nolt drunk might have really helped this game.

I have only played the Struggle of Empires version, and I liked it.  There were some changes to the game (combat and units) that I like more in this version, but the importance of certain areas (Rome) was a big disappointment.

The games are different enough that I can still play one over the other, but they are similar enough in that if I play one I won't feel the need to play the other for a while.  It feels like an expansion to Struggle of Empires rather than a different game.

An unsuccessful follow-up on Struggle of Empires.

The most notable failures:
- new elements of the mechanics (e.g. Senate Vote) - not thought-out, not working well, just thrown in...
- way too excessive inflow of neutral markers - they literally revolutionize situation on the board instead of just modifying it (like in SoE)
- enormous agressiveness of the game (SoE had the right level of hostilities)
- the game is absurdly overproduced.  Not only it's difficult to find the space to set it up, but the components are not functional (too big and they are just obstacle to playing).  A nonsense.

Struggle of Empires is not flawless either, but I would choose SoE over CotE any day.

You better have a BIG table for this puppy, way too big really but nice and nice bits to go with it. 

We played the updated version rules which seemed good overall but the game is still really a RISK style game with some other elements thrown in, some good ie forced alliances that change which was interesting and some bad, still too long really and for multiplayer war I think AGOT, Antike or Mare Nostrum are probably better choices. 

Might like to try the original rules or even the new rules again as I'm not sure our one play was a good representation but based on game length I'm not too eager to play anytime soon. Note I have not yet tried SOE to compare..

I played the Martin Wallace variant of this game and I found my self wishing we were playing the other set of rules that were more Axis and Allies like. The game is decided by who controls Rome and the random starting mechanism can hose you there. The actions seemed far to restricted. Normally I like games that are restrictive, but this game would have been better with 3 actions per round instead of two.

I'm not too sure about this one. The original rules are pretty uninspiring and, after 1 game, I do not think I will play with them again.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2012)

We only played the game based on Struggle of Empires. I like it. It is only a 7 due to the long down time. Our game was an epic 8 hours long (with 6 players) and we played only until the 4th campaign.  Although I don’t care how long the game is, the down time was excessive.

The alliance mechanic is very neat and is the main attribute why I like the game. Also the game has a lot of tension, not only because your rivals are trying to kill you, but because you only have 2 actions each turn, so the decisions are pretty hard. And at the beginning the money is hard to come by (which I like :devil:).

The components are top notch, a huge map (which requires a big table) and lots of miniatures. :D I liked the combat system, it has luck in it but it is manageable.
 
I would play again, but perhaps with faster players or fewer players.

Being honest, this is a good game but not a game I’m usually willing to play. There are other great games that take less time to play than this so I’m re rating this to a 5.0.

Ainda só joguei a versão base, de entre os dois jogos distintos que estão presentes neste produto. A versão base é perfeita para quem gosta de Wargames, para quem gostava do Risco mas achava-o muito simples. Este jogo é visualmente atrativo, vindo com diversas unidades muito bem trabalhadas. Tem um tabuleiro gigante, onde assentam todas aquelas unidades... lindo. É no entanto algo demorado. Para jogar com tempo. 
Fica ainda por experimentar a versão avançada, que dizem que é melhor, e que integra um baralho de cartões e carradas de diplomacia. 

Neste momento já joguei a versão mais complexa. É um novo jogo... inteiramente.
Tem algumas mecânicas parecidas com Struggle of Empires. A jogabilidade salta dos dados e transfere-se para o jogador. Compete a este gerir os acontecimentos através das suas opções, nomeadamente o uso das cartas e outros meios que dispõe, e decidir qual a estratégia a seguir, pois não dá para ter tudo, é necessário optar por uma via. Parece-me ser um dos melhores jogos de guerra que há por aí.

Sometimes we forget that Italia gets a card from every senate vote...and we forget to give chaos for recruiting as well.  Ceasars or Generals cannot protect influence tokens alone or stop armies from passing through, though they can be attacked to force them to retreat.   The diplomacy cards require the the player have at least one troop in it.

One try of CotE2. It seem like a more streamlined version of Struggle of Empires. The components are of course superior to SoE, but to me the theme maybe a little weaker. Overall I think this game is great value for money. One good Martin Wallace game and also an ameritrash game that can be played with the kids (when you have the time for a long game)

CotE II: This is Struggle of Empires - the Ameritrash edition. That said, I'm not a big fan of SoE as I feel it pretends to be more than it is. In the end it suffers the fate of many multiplayer conflict games of somebody playing the kingmaker and it ends up as a completely unsatisfying experience. At least, CotE II is more honest in that you know what awaits you from the moment you put your plastic legions on the map. With the alliance mechanism the single brillant element from SoE is transferred. It even improves on SoE with a clever combat resolution mechanism and the limited availability of improvements feels right. The senate aspect is another good twist. Unbelievably, Eagle Games manages to top Martin Wallace in underdevelopment. A board of almost 1 square meter with lots of unused areas but still to small in some areas for the enormous masses of miniatures in later stages, flimsy card stock, absurdly huge coins, rules translations not done by native speakers and almost limitless movement leading to a free-for-all bash the leader fest? This game has it all. In the end, the length of 5 hours kills this for more plays. If I want some lengthy multiplayer conflict, I rather go for Mare Nostrum, History of the World or even the classic MB Gamemaster Series or Buck Rogers.
CotE Classic: Only read the rules. The game features player elimination (all others!) as the only way to victory. Outdated and not worth playing.

CLASSIC EAGLE GAME!  (Here I mean that they include MULTIPLE rules for the provided components, both of which suck.  Why not focus on ONE set of good rules instead of TWO mediocre/bad ones?)

Classic Rules:  COMPLETE trashing of original.  Use the components of this version and the rules (w/your preferred catapult fix) from the original.  Too bad they screwed up and didn't give you enough men, control markers, ROADS, AND GENERALS!!!  (Hint: one of the BEST ideas of the original was generic pieces distinguished by control markers and generals)

CotE II:  Eh, not that impressed.  FORCED ALLIANCES?  WTF?  

And the new combat dice system is worthless.

GREAT BITS though.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but vastly inferior to Struggle of Empires. 

Why is the board so big? No one knows. Most of it's unused space. I guess the game's a reimplementation of Wallace's classic on another game's board. That's like doing a version of Citizen Kane starring Wallace Shawn as the main character.

I prefer the unique dicerolling mechanics in SoE, but at the same time, it's nice to have a little more themeyness. Fights seem a little random, though, and I missed having access to all the tiles all the time. 

What it comes down to is, this is more like Risk than SoE. It has the alliances, sure, but for some reason it felt more random and unpredictable; I could never quite figure out who was going to beat up on me next, and the movement rules that make it pretty easy to get from Numidia to Iberia by land didn't help. 

Also, don't kid yourself: this is a game about money, in a way that the original definitely isn't. The Chaos mechanism is a little more forgiving than unrest, but that's not inappropriate; there's nothing worse than soldiering through eight hours of Struggle only to find yourself at 19 - no, oops, 20! - when someone attacks you unexpectedly. (That's never happened to me, but I've seen it happen, and I can kind of understand the deep perturbation that can cause.)

I did like the unit differentiation, something SoE could have used. 

This could've been so much better, though, esp. given the theme. Why not give everyone a few more actions, give more widely varying veeps to a couple more territories, and turn it into an all-out, nine-hour simulation game?

New pet peeve: games where everything's in increments of five. Veeps come in fives, money comes in fives and tens... would it have been so hard to tell people they just got eight veeps in a round instead of 40? I mean, the game's so freaking big they had to pump up the numbers just to keep pace?

Long story short, I wanted to like it, and did to a point, but SoE does such a great job filling this niche that I don't think I'll see much need to play this again in the future.

Two epic games in one box.
The first variant of the game is basically a more complex version of risk. this variant is well done and if you like this sort of games you can have a lot of fun with it.
For me however the brilliant thing about this remake is the second variant. Here you are trying to gain political influence by diplomacy and troop movements. Your options range from using brute military force to political actions in the senat. You have to choose carefully from this wide array of options because your availabe number of actions are limited. 
In this game having the largest army doesn't necessary mean you will win the game because in the end it is only important if you can use your army sucessfully to gain political influence. 
The only bad thing about this game might be its epical game length.

Original rules are fantastic, really fun, though I don't know if its entirely fair to get stuck in the middle empires of the board.  Seems like the three empires on the outside end up lasting easier.  Really unique mechanics with legions and roads. I have not yet played the new version (have played Struggle of Empires though), only the classic rules.
Great mechanic idea with legions and leaders to move units. Cities and roads are great strategic elements too. Fun to take over the world, but not fun to get stuck in the middle where its easy pickings.

Conquest of the Empires 1984 was a great game with some proglems.  Eagle games fixed some of those problems with their board design and combat system.

My major complaint is that I bought this game because I wanted to have a newer / fresher version of conquest of the empire.   The 2nd set of rules that comes with the game completely changes the game.   My whole group really hated it and the rule book was very ambiguous and difficult to interpret.   I play with a very experienced war gamers and we were all very disappointed and felt that we spent way too much for an update of a game that we already owned.

I normally like eagle games but this one in my opinion (aside from the art and board) is a flop.

El juego me podrá gustar o no, pero la mandíbula inferior me llegó al suelo cuando abrí la caja: cientos de miniaturas de un nivel de detalle muy aceptable (lo de la catapulta móvil es digno de estudio), un tablero precioso cuyo tamaño obliga a sacar las alas de la mesa del comedor como si fuera la cena de Nochebuena y unas monedas del tamaño de las de chocolate... Dos modos de juego (el CoTE II de Wallace tiene unas reglas de mayor profundidad) y,si uno dispone de las horas necesarias, puede ser un juegazo. Es, de hecho, un juegazo.

Most likely, you will have been attracted to this game either by the theme or the components. I must say that this is, by far, the most overproduced game I've ever seen: the plastic figurines are huge and the catapults can even fire little paper balls! The board is so large that, even with the humongous miniatures, only the most tiny regions are crowded when you gather a lot of them in one. Even the coins are of plastic instead of cardboard! It's the kind of game that, if you have kids, you can buy blindly if you find it cheap because, even if you hate it, you can give them all the pieces as toys.

But is the game something more than an overproduced risk? Well, yes and no: the combat is quite random and it sums up to who can roll better results. The only reason to buy cavalry or catapults is to mitigate luck, but as they are more expensive than infantry, a lucky player with more footmen that you will crush you badly. There are also action cards, but thankfully they aren't dealt randomly, so there's a degree of control.

Now you must be thinking "Why on earth would I want an overproduced version of Risk themed in Rome?". Simple: the alliances. Each turn, a bid distributes all the players in two teams, not only making you impossible to go attack one of your team mates, but you can also cross their territories peacefully. That gives the game a unique and distinct feeling. The side effect is that the game is only playable with even numbers.

It's not a bad game, definitely worth a try, but I'm unsure if it's worth the asking price, not to mention you'll have to store the huge box somewhere. If wallet and space are not of your concern, it's a worthy addition to most collections.

Only played with the advanced rules (based on Struggle of Empires). Combat is easier compared to Struggle and the senate vote opens new possibilities.

The clone of Struggle of Empires. Several things different, some simplifications (tiles) and some news (senate, figures).

Unexpectedly, as a great fan of SoE, I liked the first play. On the other hand it is too similar to SoE to buy it. If I have a chance to play with squad proper for CotE, I undoubtedly would prefer to play SoE instead.

Based on 9+ plays (3-, 4-, & 5-player, 2 different groups) with the SOE-based "II" rules.  (And one play with the "Classic" rules, which I don't care for.)

My group really likes this!  Moves pretty quickly (not much downtime), opportunities for tricky/surprising moves, lots of tough choices.  The alliance bidding has some really neat effects (quite a lifesaver when everyone at the table is trying to kill you, which seems to happen to me a lot), and I like the way chaos is done.  (Despite its appearance, it's not at all the straight Axis & Allies or Risk game I thought it would be.)

Its an intriguing game in that you always want to do far more than you are allowed in your turn.  As well, the added intrigue of knowing your ally for one campaign season may turn out to be your enemy in the next campaign season.  People who struggle with making decisions in a huge board with many options will struggle in this game.  Game can easily bog down if such players are involved.  Plan for 4-5 hours the first time you play using the Martin Wallace rules.  Brainburner, beautiful pieces but too large a board that suffers from warping.  As well, since I have Martin's SOE, I really don't need this game even if it is more beautiful...:-)  I prefer SOE because it also tends to play more quickly.  CotE can really drag on forever.

Holy massive board game batman! Maybe not the biggest game box, but certainly the heaviest (almost 10 lbs) and the grandest array of game components.... EVER. The map is friggin HUGE. Game pieces galore. You certainly get your money's worth in terms of physical substance with this game... or rather games.

The game is actually two games in one. By far, the newer CotE II is the best game, and makes this well worth picking up. CotE II has some very dynamic game flow, and its a pretty exciting game to play.

The game pieces are fantastic, though a word of warning... count your game components. It seems like the company has an issue with getting the precisely correct number pieces in the boxs conistently.

I think a few elements of the game would benefit from some house rules tweaks.

Overall, very fun, and any negative points are definately outweighed by the positive.

After playing the second edition rules the verdict is still out on this one.  The game is long and fiddly.  The bidding mechanics for turn order and alliances can bog down the pace.  The game is also prone to intense analysis paralysis especially for newbies.  Being able to teleport troops all over the board regardless of proximity considerations is also disconcerting.  

I suppose I need to play again to get a deeper feel of the game.  First impressions leave me with a "meh".

This game is a remake of the 1984 classic that was part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster Series. In this game you are one of many Roman generals vying for power in Imperial Rome, employing legions, cavalry, and catapults to reach your objectives.
This version of the game has two sets of rules, one set similar to the original version (except that it has fixed the broken catapult rules) and a new set of rules based on Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires.

Just picked up a copy.  Played my first game and loved it.  Now have to try the classic version to compare the two.  Love the huge board and the great pieces.  Sure to be a favorite, but it won't be a game night staple as it takes so dang long to play. 
[b]UPDATE:[/b]Played the tweaked original game and prefer it.  The other is just... boring, I suppose.  I like having cities and roads on the board to add to the visual appeal.  Still, it takes just as long to play, which means table time will be minimal.

I've only played the "classic" version. It was a fun "dice-fest" romp. Very A & A derivative. Buy units, spread out by taking provinces to gain income, buy more units, do battle or wait for another player to make a fatal error. I'm very interested in playing the Struggle of Empires rules.

This is a game that sadly I've only played maybe once (due to the heavy time limit) but look forward to playing more in the future.  There's a lot to like about this game - the theme is so engaging and the components are top notch with the coins and large sided miniatures - plus the game comes with two sets of different rules, which essentially means you get two games for the price of 1!  Rule Set #1 (which is more or less the same game released by Milton Bradley under their Gamemaster Series) is really just a pure combat game and not at all unlike Axis & Allies.  Rule Set #2 is more varied and in my opinion actually attempts to  implement mechanisms that make the game emulate the power struggles in the later Roman Republic.

Good God! Its Freakin' Huge!

Not bad... played the SoE rules version. I like it about as much as I like struggles.  but I really need to play both games more to get a better idea about them. 

I do have to say that the size of this game is crazy. Its just too big. It required 2 tables and you have to get up and walk around to see things like cards. I do not know that the size adds anything to the game. It could have been 1/3rd smaller and not suffered a thing. 

Also the detail onthe bits is nice but fromt he table edge I had a hard time figuring out where peoples generals were. They look too much like the other figures. I plan on painting my leaders, but Eagle should know better and could have easily made them stand out more.

The game is getting a seven for now and I dont think it will rise much more than that. It is fun but it requires the right mood to play. 

I will try the old school rules soon too. I think that version is even more mood dependant but with the right group it could be fun... I see this one bing fun with my son in about 6 years. (he is 2)

The bits for this one make the game less fun.  On a table built for 6 people, this game barely fits.  Most of the time spent in this game is spent setting the game up and trying to find somewhere to put your pieces.  I like the game part, but Eagle needs to get over their obsession with enormous boards.  They're only impressive until you try to actually play on them.  This game is the reason I got Age of Steam over Railroad Tycoon.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on 1 play - We broke this one out and had a learning game for 9 of us (some of us were paired up as teams).  I enjoyed this a lot even though we made a few mistakes and got badly beaten down in the first campaign season (Don't build a city when the player after you can spend all his money and take it away from you in the same turn!). There is a lot going on in a game like this and the multitude of strategic and tactical options makes the replayability level very high. I left wanting to play again and I'm sure we shall next week. This rating will probably go UP.

RATING: 8
As far as epic games go this one is pretty solid. I've only played with the CotE II rules (included with the game) and it was quite a bit of fun.

The game (with those rules) is not solely focused on warfare. There is bidding, power cards to purchase, maneuvering, and general points gathering. And it all works really well together.

If we had a complaint about the game (with the II rules) is that the whole board is not used or relevant. Considering the size of the board, it seemed like a bit of a miss.

In general though, everyone stepped away from the table having enjoyed their time. Great components as well.

2 / 5 - Fair.

Unusually you get two completely different rules sets in the box, rather than just variants of the same game. The first is one of the better Risk-style conquest games around. The second is a variant on Struggle of Empires with good and bad points and added Roman flavour. Nice to get both for the same price, but aside from all the lovely plastic bits, both are absurdly long and bloated compared with their related games.

Beatiful game. Wonderfurl artwork and detailed miniatures.It´s two games in one actually. The Classic variant reminds to Risk adding some more elements. It´s total war. The Advanced version called Conquest of the Empire 2 is a totally different game. More focused on intrigue, defining strategies, balancing cards and alliances. If you like Ancient warfare and politics this game is a MUST HAVE!. Superb!.
The only negative thing is that you will need at least 4 folks and of course game duration. Anyway, one of the best games ever!!.

Played only once with the basic rules.
The game is VERY pretty with the usual three parts giant board and cute miniatures.
However the standard rules make it basically a slightly tweaked risk with a couple of different pieces. All the problems of player-elimination, shifting alliances and dice luck are there and in addition there aren't "mission cards" so the lenght of the game increases.

Looking forward to play the other set of rules.

Man, I was kind of disappointed with this one.  First of all, I'm not all that into bits and all the plastic didn't impress me.  Nor did the garishly covered enormous board.

Playing the game, though, actually made it more clear what the game lacks than what it has.  To be fair, it does implement combined arms advantages well with the dice, but there are no overrun attacks, there are no adjustments to amphibious invasions on a die roll.  Furthermore, the alliance thing breaks down if there are only three players.

CONS: The battle system is overly simplistic. The map board is just way too big and could have easily been trimmer by a foot in both length and width without loosing any playing space. The game wouldn't be much without the forced alliances.
Pros: gorgeous minis, innovative forced alliance system IS the game and both great fun and novel mechanic.

A remake of CotE with Struggle of Empire rules.  Problem is I would rather just play Struggle or the original (w/a fixed cannon mechanic).  There's nothing terribly wrong with this.

Update: After a ~2 year hiatus from COE2, my group recently pulled this game out and played a few sessions.  Result - raised my rating even higher.  With the right group of people (and that really is important in this game), COE2 is great fun, and a fantastic change from our standard multiplayer games (mostly euro/strategy games).  Its a much more lively game, much more banter and negotiations going on.  Yes its subject to much more chaos than a euro, but if your in the mood for some tactical thinking, sabre rattling, and deal making, this may suit you well.  Its one of the  few multiplayer wargames I've played that I really like. 

COE2 is a great game to play with the right crowd.  Lots of negotiations and deal-making goes on, and if you can't make a deal through smooth talk, you can force a temporary alliance via the alliance-bid system.  A good amount of military 'strategizing' is required as well - a very fun game.

Everything I like about Struggle of Empires, + a kajillion colorful bits. The comment by one player after our first game was, "I feel like there was a massive butterfly effect. If even one player had made a different choice, the entire game would have turned out differently."

I have two main beefs about the game as-is. First, Italia seems almost OVERLY important. We had a single player dominate it for most of the game and he walked away with a victory. It did not seem like there was any solid way of attacking him without weakening ourselves severely, and given the nature of the shifting alliances, there was no incentive to do so: you could not guarantee that after weakening yourself in such an attack, you wouldn't get attacked yourself, and you STILL need the time (and money) to convert the tokens of the player you conquered. This means that there is a bit too much of a potential for a runaway leader, without any strong recourse to prevent it from occurring.

Still, all in all it was a fun experience, the choices feel meaningful, there is some nice tension throughout, especially in the bidding for alliances, and the game evolves in some extremely interesting ways.

RATING: 7.25
COTE Classic: Less scripted than Axis & Allies, but a major Amerigame drawback is player elimination. Suffers from diceyness that can predetermine the winner (or loser) with no catchup mechanic.  The inflation factor amplifies any disparity to speed up the game, but the game still seemed to draw out and be less exciting once the few powerful players remained.  Game duration vs. fun factor is incongruent.

COTE II: Euro-game in a wargame's clothing.  As with most American games, the randomness reared its ugly head in our play, creating a tactical geographic advantage upon initial placement that allowed one player to jump out to a runaway lead and never look back.  The map is impressive in its size - but very few of the territories actually have a value in winning the game.  The game's bits moderately inflate its rating.

Play the Rules Version II. Almost no complaints at all. Fun, tense, player hosage, diplomacy, and the occasional attack. A lot more going on in this game than one tends to think. Great adaptation of the Stuggle of Empire rules, toned down for easy consumption, yet losing very little flavor. Play in 4-5 hours. Great game, Eagle finally made a winner.

Risk, but with Romans. The Advanced game puts more meat on the bones of this, but I wouldn't suggest a serious gamer trying to play the Basic game and expecting fireworks.

2012/12/30 - I really am frustrated with this game. It seems to drag on endlessly unless players are willing to be very (almost foolishly) aggressive. Combat is luck based, and that is fine given the simplicity of the game. What IS frustrating, though, and something that gets under the skin of a wargamer like myself is that, movement advantages aside, the units have no special skills and that the dice-combat system strongly discourages forming units of various types - keeping it infantry-only or cavalry-only sharply reduces your opponent's chances of inflicting losses and is quite gamey. We have resorted to artificial endings to all our plays as the game drags on interminably.

UPDATE: Re-acquired in order to play at least Classic CotE with my son

UPDATE: Sold but still willing to play whenever the rare opportunity presents itself.

Everybody said this was a watered-down version of the brilliant SoE and I said, "Yes, but this has a map of the Mediterranean and concerns ancient Rome."  It looks great on paper, but with five it lagged, and the playing time--had we finished--would have been an hour per player.  There is some interesting stuff going on in here, but curiously it lacks the flavor and theming of SoE, and I have to concur with the naysayers that if I'm going to play an SoE-like game, I'll take the one that I really like and trust and know will be over in four hours tops: SoE.  I got schooled.

I have not played CotE Classic yet, though.  There's still hope.

An often times overlooked Dudes-On-A-Map game that actually delivers. The classic rules are an excellent and streamlined alternative to games like A&A and the CotE II rules alter the game to be a variant on Struggle of Empires. So apart from the beautiful gigantic map and the huge number of plastic miniatures included, you basically get two very different games for the price of one (which, coincidentally, is at an all-time low as of this writing).

Slightly dumbed-down version (but elegantly done) of Struggle of Empires, which I rate a 7, but the production quality here and variety and ease of game play make this a solid 9 for me.  Like randomness and variety of cards (more limited choice than all the tiles in Struggle and better combos) and the Senate vote mechanism adds a whole new element.  Gotta love the map and plastic pieces.  Speed of play is fast with little or no down time due to quick two action turns.  Thank you Martin Wallace and Eagle Games!!  Every game we've played so far has been close.   This rating is for the new game rules, not the classic game, which we have yet to try.

This 2005 republishing has two games in one. The other game is using Martin Wallace's rules for Struggle of Empires. You bid for alliances, then each player takes two actions per round (four rounds in a campaign year). There are now Senate cards, which allow you to vote for bills, and influence leader in Italia allow you to randomly reclaim a spent Senate card. 

This game takes 4 hours to play. If you enjoyed Struggle of Empires, it is a slight improvement to it.

This rating is for the new rules set; I haven't played the classic rules - they look too much like a souped up "Risk" game.

This is a fun game with some interesting mechanics. The alliance rules and victory conditions create uneasy stand-offs between troops all over the board. As a Martin Wallace-inspired creation, it's all about turn and money management, as well as taking advantage of those special cards when they come along. Interesting stuff.

The only downside is that much of the huge map ends up staying vacant while troops build in the hotspots. This game really needs an oversized Italy space, (a la those typical world maps which make Europe and America look much bigger than they really are).

Conquest II ruleset: Made it through 0.4125 of a four season game with six players.

Playing 60 minutes a day on non-contiguous days was hard, but if we could maintain a pace this seems like both a very fun and potentially very epic game.  So many choices--so few that one can do in a turn.  So much can happen between your turns that it's hard to be strategic, but there's not enough actions per turn to be purely tactical.

Will play again soon, hopefully.

First impression (5 players): There are two sets of rules along the game, we played Martin Wallace's Struggle of Emprires. Because map is designed to work with two pretty different (I think) games it feels rather awkward to play as some territories have no real use game wise. As a game it is good but rather on the long side with our group (over 6 hours) and this shows on my rating.

Components are fantastic.  Having two different rules sets is a big bonus.  Classic wargame where you build armies, collect territories and eliminate opponents.  Or you can play auction/area influence strategy game based on Struggle of Empires.

Forced alliance rules in second set make for less politics and diplomacy than in the classic version?

The "new" rules are close, but not identical to Struggle of Empires (I definitely prefer SoE).  Movement feels a little convoluted, luck is a bigger factor, the map is a little convoluted and the Senate Vote seems like a tacked on pain in the ass.

I haven't played the "classic" version - rating is based solely on the SoE version and is influenced by the fact that SoE is much better.

Have played by both old and new rules.  Old rules mainly do fix a problem with the earlier game.  New rules take a great game and tweak it so that it is a game in it's own right.  New version is preferred, both are most excellent to play--then you throw in the spectacular production value and this package exudes quality with a ton of fun and hours of enjoyment to be had.  Most highly recommended.

This is the best Eagle game I've played so far.  The pieces are all top notch.  The game-play has a lot of interesting ideas.  However, it often seems as though there's not much to do.  Maybe we're just not playing it right yet?

First impression: Overwhelming pyhsical presence. Over-sized board and minis, of which some are familiar from Sid Meyers Civilization.
Game play seems very exciting, but the game still needs to prove it. Very similar to "Struggle of empires", but with less options.

Very fun, simple war game (note that there are two versions, one much more complex than the other) that plays fast (with the basic rules) but takes time to play to a conclusion. Tons of cool, colorful plastic soldiers, catapults, cavalry, and ships, and an enormous board on which to play add to the enjoyment. Have only played the more basic version of the game. To me this seems like the perfect game for guys in their teens and 20s, who have all the time in the world to sit down and play this with their buddies. Purchased September 2008.

A major upgrade for a classic, this is a great game for players of all skill levels. Experienced players will enjoy the new balance, and beginners will just have fun with the pieces and beautiful game board (start them with the "classic" rules of course).

Well Done!

I appreciated much more COTE Classic than the second version. The first game is extremely fun, easy to understand and violent as hell. The second one is far too abstract for my taste: the theme stays but everything else is so unrealistic and anti-simulation that... No, definitely not for me.

COTE Classic: Rate 8
COTE II : Rate 5.5

My overall rating is based on the fact that having two games inside a box is already a good thing, but for me the valid game is just one.

I have not played the Classic version, but it has to be better than the old "Race for the Catapults" was.  CoEII has excellent components.  The coins are large and "manly."  The minis are sprueless and finely detailed.  The map is enormous and beautiful, maybe too enormous for some.

Have played both versions of the game, one time each.  

Basic rules: Rather unimpressed.  Player elimination plus a strong rich-get-richer element killed any interest I might have had.  There are much better short strategy/dicefest games than this.

Advanced Rules: Somehow managed to take the brilliant Struggle of Empires rules and ruin them.  On it's own, it's tolerable, but whenever I play I can't help but think about how much more elegant and fun Struggle is.

Had one game of Conquest of the Empire at my games group's monthly Sunday session. For me, games have to be really exceptional to play for 4 or 5 hours rather than 2-3 shorter games.

Played using the modified Struggle of Empire rules. 
If you want to play Struggle of Empires - Play Struggle of Empires a vastly superior game. This combines risk like mechanics for combat - which detract from the SOE style. 
For us the conquest was who would get Italy and could the rest force that person not to have anything else.
Found that having most of the board empty except for the few victory provinces to be distracting.

Will need to try the revised gamemaster rules

Classic Rules make for a fun game with the right people. I liked the overall feeling, very classic, indeed.

CotEII is an excellent game! Very tense. Wish I could play it more often.

CotEII now with more plays: The game is indeed very well balanced. It actually forces you carefully plan your campaigns and spend the final campaign turn preparing for the next one, including the choice of alliances. The game also feels like it allows for many different aproaches, you need many games to explore them all.

The classic game is a great joe six-pack game. Move and kill. Straight forward slaughter. It has enough constraints on movement to not feel silly (ala Risk). The CoE II rule set refines the game a bit, adding some euro flavor and making it more strategic.

Port of Struggle of Empires with much nicer components and better dice mechanics for the battles. Themewise might fall a bit shorter than SoE as it includes basically two different games: large chunk of board is wasted i.e. used only in the classic version. Plays quite long, but it is worth the effort if you get enough players at the table (you'll need a large one=)

I like it.  It's long, and if you play COTE2 then you need all the players to understand the balances of the diplomacy auction system or it breaks the game.

 Great Game.  Even during downtime, plenty of things to plan and consider.  Unlike many games that have Victory Points given several times throughout the game, it is a little harder for the players to "take down" the leader towards the end.  This has always been a gripe, that leader at 3/4 pole puts a target on the chest.   The leader CAN be caught, but through clever play, planning and luck, he can also hold onto that lead until the end.  We prefer the full FIVE season game to the shorter four seasons.  We play with the 5 VP for England House Rule.

RATING: 7
Played the origanal Gamemaster version many, many times as a kid. All plays with the new version have been with the Classic Rules as 3 player games. Fun and bloody, but long. The game forces players to jocky for position and maneuver with great deliberation so as not to lose any prized armies or even more important generals to a lost battle. Each player will have at least two fronts to defend. Lots of risky choices to make. The game could benefit from a variety of house rules which would impose a time frame other than player elimination to the end of the game.

Which brings us to the 2nd version of the rules, which I haven't played. With only 4 turns (5 for a longer game) and 4 campaigning seasons per turn, a player will have only 16 or 20 rounds to play. With a definate time frame, this game should be quicker to play. Instead of conquest, this version focuses on increasing the influence of your Ceasar on the Roman Empire. Resources and actions to accomplish your goals look to be extremely limited, which should force some very hard choices on players. It looks like there are many different viable strategies to pursue, and with the alliance auction, each game should be very different and unpredictable. After reading the rulebook, I am very excited to play the second version of this game. Now I just need the time and players.

Only played with the new "SoE-based"-rules.
The system with bidding for turn-order and alliance is very nice, and the game is fun and enjoyable on that one alone.
But - I'm not a big fan of games were the battles are heavily decided by the luck of dice, and the luck-factor in the initial placement of starting-positions will make or break the game for some lucky/unlucky ones...

RATING: 6
(Advanced Game): A strange mix of Wallace's Euro-wargame hybrid with old-style Ameritrash figures and combat rules which gels poorly. Some of the design decisions seem to result purely from the need to adapt the original game's board and pieces to the new rules. I prefer the use of the tiles in Struggle of Empires to the conquest card here, and the senate did not add much to the game for me. Above all, the problem is the (thematically justifiable) centrality of Italia, which creates a big splodge of a conflict in the centre of the board and can allow one player to race ahead of the others.

This game is way too big. The board is huge and will only fit on the biggest table at my parent's house. I think it would've been better if they'd gone with smaller boards, miniatures and coins (though it's cool that those are plastic).

The double ruleset is a nice addition, though the Conquest of the Empire II rules are the better game, as it has more clearly defined win conditions and a turn limit, whereas the 'classic' game goes on until one player is left (which can take a long time).

Unfortunately, the game's size adds so much to its setup time that I hardly get to play it.

Excellent multi-player cut-throat style Ameritrash game.  Two action limit per turn equates to threaded turns, and limits down time.  This is a long game though, 1.5 hours per player; 6 players = 9 hrs easily.

Hooray!...I have all of the after-market colors, Dark Red, Light Blue, Light Gray, Dark Gray, Orange and Gold; thanks to some very kind and generous people from Ontario, Canada.
{now if I can just find more people to play!}

Have played in 9 games of CotE2. Have won 2, both times without controlling Italia (Rome).

7 out of 10 games have been won by the player controlling Roma (Italia), 3 out of 10 have been won with the "peripheral" (non-Roma) strategy.

RATING: 7
SoE version: Some improvements over the Warfrog game, some changes that probably had unintended affects. Overall, I think it's about par with the SoE version, and which you should get depends on how much you like each setting & how much you need cool pieces. As I said on my SoE comments: a cool wargame mixed with majority control. [Rating: 7]

Classic Version: pretty so-so. It can deadlock easily if no one is willing to play aggressively, and playing aggressively can be a deficit. However, you're probably not getting the game for this version. [Rating: 3]

The other cool bit: the two versions will probably be attractive to very different demographics of players.

CotEII: Well, first of all, I have to point out that I adore Struggle of Empires; I give it a 10.  So, no matter what, CotEII was going to have to live up to that obscene standard.  I do have a trust in Wallace's designs so this wasn't biased out of the gate, but I also deeply suspected that this wasn't going to hold its own in comparison.  I didn't imagine that I was going to be this disappointed.

Set up is irritating.  By replacing the tiles with randomly drawn cards and by giving a random set up without a home base you really need to assess the reprocussions of allegiances and try to come up with something of a strategy to build your "civ".  It is much more important to balance allegiances in this game as there is no strong position to build from.  You must create forced allies that will not quash you on your first outing.  This is engaging, but then the turn order is even more relevant as there is a limited number of cards to draft from and some cards are just outright better than other cards.  This kills much of the subtle beauty of the original game.  

As the first season reveals itself, there isn't much in the way of strategy here.  Mostly, you are just taking advantage of what others leave for you, either from the card draft or from positions of weakness.  The only thing stopping players from storming each other rampantly, is the friction that is created from the leaders, but they make movement so irritating that there just isn't much that is fun about moving the pieces around the board.  You either can teleport or you are stagnant, the way to pull off successfull maneuvers is purely logistics.  If you are going to strip the strategy from the game by removing the tiles and adding random special power cards then at least offer some joy in moving plastic army pieces around.

Italia seems too powerful, but anyone that gets it can become a target and then it is a big pile up which end up in the luck of the dice.  It should be pointed out that because generals are so disproportionately expensive that players will only have a couple armies and thereby have big stacks of them filling up a territory.  Eventually, you get board or pile up on Italia with obnoxious results. Roll, roll, roll.  See who wins.  Of course, because the battles are on such a large scale both players will end up weak and have to spend multiple turns repairing one of their two armies, effectively have of their force.  If a player has both of his armies hit they are going to be ruined.

The reality is that SoE is just better in every way. CotEII is just dumber. The diversified units and the card draws just detract from the beautiful simplicity of the battles and granular progression of the tiles, and the game is longer.  Why would I ever play this again instead of SoE?

At hour one of the first play I thought that this was a 6, by hour 2 a 5.  By the end 3.5, I'd hate to spend more time on this for fear it will continue to drop.  We nicknamed this Conquest of Patience.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play. This is the fourth Eagle game I played, and it ranks second for me - better than Age of Mythology and Civilization but lower than Railroad Tycoon. I really like a lot of the mechanics in this game, especially the influence majority rules. The one issue our group had with the game is that the board is HUGE but only 11 provinces matter for scoring. Yes, I understand the implication for movement and blocking, but it would be nice if the outer provinces were worth something.

This game felt like a bootleg you could buy on the streets of Chinatown, living up to the mantra of shittier in every way. I love SoE but despised this futile attempt by Eagle Games to take a game (Conquest I) and make it something it is not.

RATING: 2
Well, we tried playing this, using the advanced version of the rules. I didn't see the point of the game, or the enjoyment in it. It moved incredibly slowly: you couldn't seem to do too much. Everyone was bored. The rules seemed needlessly funky. We gave up after several turns. I doubt it'll ever come out of the box again. (The coins are cool, though.)

RATING: 4
Beautifully produced and certainly fun to play with the pieces. We played the new rules and I think the alliance mechanic is really neat. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends. There's not really enough actions to get much done and the board ends up pretty static, with much of it not even being used. Give me a little Shogun or even some Risk Legacy to get my world domination on, this just falls pretty flat for me.

Played the Struggle of Empires based rules. It's actually a nice adaption of the rules. For example: 
- only a few (8) of the tiles (cards in this version) are available, so it's more approachable
- combat is simplified (instead of naval combat preceding land, using the difference between 2d6, etc., you just roll a number of dice and match icons to your forces)
- currency: no population, just money

Still, I prefer the original SoE. Plus, SoE's board isn't ridiculously huge!

I've played a simple version of the game with only two players but I've liked it very much. It took a while to play but it has a good rythm. Some clever ideas on this one.

Not as good as Struggle, the random appearance of the tech tiles reduces AP a bit, but the movement system feels very wonky and even more odd than in its predecessor. As usual with Eagle Games theres components for the sake of components, and they're even not that pretty.

RATING: 7.9
Played both the Classic and CotE II. Classic primarily felt like a wargame with some neat infrastructure gameplay mechanics such as building cities, fortifying cities, and building roads. But Classic has none of the political mechanics of CotEII. I really wish there was a balance truck between the two because I LIKE the idea of fortified cities and roads (which aren't present in CotEII) and I LIKE the influence and senate system of CotEII (not present in Classic).

In the end, both games are very good. My group had a blast with just beer, conversation, and smashing legions together. 

Update, so sad that I traded this one away.. but my group just doesn't have the time to play this one through.

Got a brand new unpunched copy for 10 bucks! This game really has been some of our best gamimg. Quick turns, little down time. Lots of engaging choises. My group, new and old, always have a good time playing even if feelings always get hurt. Always part II, never played the original CoTE. Struggle of Empires is good too but not as good as this IMO.

Tweaks the classic MB Gamemaster Series version, plus gives a whole second rules set by Glenn Drover, attempting to Euro-ize an Ameritrash game.  Surprisingly, it works. No longer open-ended, session times seem about right for this strategy, war game, area-majority, and auction blend.

Enjoy this game as well (only play the Conquest 2 rules), unfortunately it only gets to the table about once every three years or so. Alliance bidding system is really cool, combat odds system is also neat. Looks deceptively like Risk but the combat system, alliances, upgrade cards, chaos system, influence and senate make for an actually deep game. The Conquest 1 rules are bland as hell however.

RATING: 9
Wow!  The first thing that jumps out at you with regards to this game is its sheer size and stunning visual beauty.  Everything is enormous!  The board, the plastic minis, the money - it's all HUGE!  Secondly, you've got two completely different games in one large package, CotE Classic and CotE II.  Now THAT is a bargoon!  The obvious comparison for me is to Eagle's other massive game of conquest, "Attack!" (and "Attack! Expansion").  CotE Classic is a simple build-and-conquer affair which bears a lot of similarities to the "Attack!" basic game, although it is a much better and more streamlined game than "Attack!".  CotE II however, is quite a bit different than (and not quite as fun as) "Attack! Expansion", and is in fact quite a bit different than most games in this genre in that the focus is not as much about conquest as it is about spreading influence (I actually recognized a few elements from "Railroad Tycoon"!).  It is a fascinating take on the genre, and the significant differences make it a worthwhile game (or two games, rather!) to add to your collection if you happen to be a fan of this sort of game.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 9/10

Game has good theme play.  Some good game mechanics such as bidding for alliances, voting in the senate, and influencing control over provinces.  These mechanics are similar to 'Struggles of Empires'.  Game play was so-so.  The game features a lackluster combat system and there are not enough critical provinces to fight over.  Game also suffers from a lack of 'catch-up' mechanism.  Every turn seemed like there was too much to do and not enough actions to do anything - led to some analysis paralysis and downtime.  The components are excellent except for the rulebook which is unclear on many items.  Played the original variant too - wargame variant.  Very 'dicey' combat.  Again, play is nothing to write home about.

[Based on the new rules, not the old ones]: Wow!  THis one is right up there with Struggle of Empires!  I'm not sure which one I like better.  This one my be slightly better due to the fact that I think it plays a little faster with slightly less downtime.  And even if that is just me and everything is equal between the two games, this one would get more play because I like the miniatures....lol....yep, that's right! I'm easily amused and like shiny colors!  Seriously, this is great fun and if you cannot choose b/w this one or SOE, flip a coin.  You'll enjoy both of them alot!

This game has really grown on me.

CoE I is a good re-make of the Battlemasters version.  They clean up the problematic rules for catapults.

CoEII is a cool re-implementation of Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires.  This game plays best with either 4 or 6 players (not 5).  The board is HUGE.  Make sure you have plenty of tablespace.  Given that the price is typically under $70 you can get this for a steal espeically since you get two really good games for the price.

Rules are a bit ambiguous in places, but FAQ and forums fill in the gaps.  Overall a lot of game in a box.  For me it fits in between risk and axis and allies.

Regarding the old ruleset;

Seems like a cool knife fight in a steel cage at first. 
In the beginning manouvering is key since you MUST win and/or be out of reach of an counter attack. If you fail to make your investments count, others will mop you up in a blink of an eye. Therefor play is rather static at first.

It seems to pick up the pace when two or three players are eliminated but I don't think I'll ever give this a second go while Samurai Swords is around.

Awesome components and HUGE map.

The second edition rules function quite well, and the in-build time limit is nice - but somehow the second edition seems to make a lot of the (really big!) map obsolete.
Bidding for alliances is a nice addition, but there isn't much to force players to act accordingly.
If two players want to gang up against a third, and are not allowed during one round because of the outcome of the alliances-auction, they can just sit tight and wait for the next round - because the third player won't be able to afford forcing the alliances for long...

En Conquest of the Empire eres un general romano que rivaliza por el poder en la Roma Imperial, empleando legiones, caballería, catapultas y trirremes para alcanzar tu objetivo. Este juego es un remake del clásico de 1984 de  Milton Bradley. Esta versión del juego tiene dos grupos de reglas, uno similar a la versión original y un nuevo grupo de reglas basadas en el juego Struggle of Empires de Martin Wallace. Contenido: 300 miniaturas de plástico (infantería, caballería, catapultas, trirremes, generales, etc.), 1 mapa gigante de 48”x36” de Europa, 2 libretos de reglas (Clásicas y nuevas reglas Conquest 2), 1 mazo de cartas para Conquest 2, dados, monedas y marcadores. 
Dos juegos en uno, al tener dos sistemas de juego. Perfecto.

RATING: 8
Gets the nod over Struggle of Empires.  Games are mostly the same, but everywhere they're different, CotE is better.

Combat is ~immensely~ improved.  Combined arms are reflected in battle in a meaningful way.  And it doesn't have any similarity at all to SoE's silly difference of dice mechanic.

Instead of the entire array of cards being available for draft from the word go, as in SoE, it's a random draw menu here.  What do you get here?  Less, blessedly less, analysis paralysis.

And theme, while not particularly strong in either offering, sticks better here.  Different military unit types.  Cards that make more sense for the context (both games have slave revolt cards, for instance, but in Roman times, slaves actually did revolt; not so much in the age of imperialism).  The senate vote.  And a board which pulls the action in the fight for control of the Roman Empire naturally to Rome.  And of course the bits and artwork.

It's a winner.

Ameri-trashy dice-rolling  battle goodness with a wonderful Martin Wallace-inspired Euro veneer that adds a challenging layer of strategy and tactics to complement the cool minis, giant map and epic battles. I still need to try the original game, but the new rules based on Struggle of Empires is terrific. A rare game that satisfies my craving for very different things: cool bits, blunt-force battles, clever play and tough decisions. It's not short, but it's worth the time investment with the right players. And given that Eagle games clearly printed too many copies of this game and it can be purchased for $20 in a saturated market, it's a great value - nice game and beautiful components. Don't pass this one by just 'cause the price is low and there are a lot of copies floating around ... give it a try!

A good enough area control conflict type game. My first play was ended after the third turn out of four as one of the group bailed early. My initial response was that it was OK but there are better conflict type games out there that scratch the same itch for me. I think I would go for Warrior Knights or Samurai Swords or something similar over this if given a choice. I just felt that something was missing from Conquest of the Empire.

The advanced game is great but it takes too long in general. The problem is that people that are not familiar with the cards, need a lot of time to decide what to take. If everyone knows the cards, then you can have an excellent game that deserves a solid 9 out of 10.
The components of this game are of the highest quality. Maybe the most overproduced game. Buy one just for all the amazing stuff that comes with the game.

This game has a few problems and ambiguities ....

The cards make it better and far less predictable than it's brother, Struggle of Empires.

Provided you do not mind a LONG game, the second set of rules (the Martin Wallace one) plays smoothly and makes for an interesting game. It was quite surprising to find that this set of rules is so easy to explain, and that turns play relatively quickly. As can be expected, there is great strategy to be found in the choice of movement, the choice of action cards and the bidding for alliances. What I particularly like about this game, is that the VP that you collect in the first 2 campaigns are just as important as the VP that you collect later on. One warning though: Do not expect a game that is all about battles - because Martin Wallace's version certainly is not!

5p & 4p. Chaotic game, card-knowledge mandatory (that's just a matter of playing more often) and very strange movement rules.
So far I've played badly, and it takes a lot of time. It seems not possible to get this one done on our regular monday-evening sessions. Must try again on an afternoon.

I can't rate this fairly. In our only game I got every voting card, which combined with control of verona gave me uncontested control of the political aspect of this game. 2 of the players who had plenty of opportunities to stop me were so frustrated they spent the rest of the game attacking me at their own expense. The 4th player who didn't attack me won easily.

good game, very interesting, exciting a lot of plastic goodies, cards, dice, coins, very beautiful game board but some ''holes'' in the rulebook. At least definitely struggle for an amateur gamer or non-native English language speakers.

This game is lots of fun.  It is a bit involved and takes up a good amount of time, but it is worth it.  The turn sequences are hard to get used to, but part of the strategy is how to use your turns correctly.  If you like strategy games that don't have to be about fighting, this is the one for you!

What do I rank? The crappy Classic rules or the much better SoE rules? I decided to go with the better ruleset.

The Classic game is bad... risk like, prone to huge amounts of stagnation - I didn't like it at all (though it was better than some of the older MB games *shudder*).

The new Struggle of Empire ruleset is solid - I actually think I like it slightly better than SoE. Its nice to see a Euro sytle wargame hybrid with such great production values. I'm not a big fan of the huge amounts of card choices you have to evaluate every turn(slows the game down) but I still love the alliance system (the best thing in the game). Over all the game might go down a bit after repeated playings... but I'm looking forward to finding out!

After two campaign seasons this game is already a huge winner in my books, and now one of my favourite "one huge map, many tiny plastic pieces" games (along with Shogun and Attack!).  The components are top quality as per Eagle Games' usual, and the mechanics and play sequence are both fantastic.  The intrigue we've seen so far has been great.

Took an already great game and fixed some minor problems but then added a new game similar to Struggle of Empires making this one of the best 2 for 1 packages around.  The best of war and politics.  Will probably win my Game with Most Heft of the year award as well.

This is a very solid empire building game which benefits greatly from the fact itw really two games in one.  Both games are also very different and enjoyable, so you really get a lot of bang for your buck.

The new rules are elegant!  No one can be taken out of the game early and the alliance system means that 3 player games are as good as 4 or 5 player games.  The alliance and turn order bid are novel features.  Likewise, the senate voting and shifting alliances add depth to the game.  Despite this completeness, it plays quickly with very little down time.  Limited actions per turn lead to difficult decisions.  The new rules represent one of the best games in memory.  Clearly written rules and top notch production quality (even the box is nice!) make this a must have for casual wargamers, pros, novices and non-wargamers alike.  Outstanding!  My group went with little sleep at Gen Con (2006) just to squeeze another play of this game in and we even skipped our scheduled activities!

CotEII - Played with 6 - loads of downtime. Playing with 2 is very worthwhile and I imagine playing with 4 will be well swell.  It is more of a resource management than a beat em up.  Quite subtle too.

Classic version with 2 - an excellent few hours spent. A fight til the end - just what a Euro gamer needs occasionally.

A great game!  Maybe a 10, but I'll have to play it again to see.

We played a 5 player game and I'm sure we barely touched on some great strategies (heck, we only bought two of the Senate vote cards and only voted 4 or 5 times).  What a back and forth contest!!  I started in the provinces and ended up controlling Italia.

Played again with 6 and downgraded it to an 8.5.  The reason is that it is a bit long, and also ended up being slightly anticlimactic at the end.  Everyone had dug into their positions and there wasn't much to be accomplished in the last year.

RATING: 8
Nearly perfect wargame with AMAZING beautiful board and figures, pretty simple rules, predictable gameplay length and good tension. Good balance between hardcore and simplicity. Applies only to the new "II" rules - classic rules are just old school crap (and reason why ratings are low)
Traded once away and got it back.

Came with pieces missing but I emailed the manufacturer. The replacements arrived in under a week and I live in Israel while the company is US-based.

I like the game but my only complaint is that the board is too big and with too much wasted space on it.

This game is a remake of the 1984 classic. In this game you are one of many Roman generals vying for power in Imperial Rome, employing legions, cavalry, and catapults to reach your objectives.

This version of the game has two sets of rules, one set similar to the original version (except that it has fixed the broken catapult rules) and an original set of rules based on Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires.

It's sufficiently similar to and different from Struggle of Empires that I can't automatically dismiss one in favor of the other.  As a conjoined pair, they count as my favorite area majority game.

CotE requires five times the tablespace of Struggles, though, which means that it's 500% less likely to be played.

I haven't played the revamp of the old rules yet but I'm looking forward to it some day.  I really like the second and newer set of rules.  I think this would be ranked higher if my group could handle it a bit better.  It has great potential to move up if it hits the table again.

OK, I'll eat a little crow.  I was not impressed with my first playing of the 'classic' ruleset, but after playing the 'conquest II' I'm much more impressed.  We had a great time.

As a SOE fan, I was reluctant to play it. I have to say we had fun. More chrome added, and some (especially the senate votings) is interesting. But, just as for alcohols, I do prefer dry stuff, and there is a little bit to much sugar here. SoE remains a far more interesting game. Probably one of the ugliest maps I've ever seen.

Huge Roman Empire game. CoE II has a lot of depth and complexity, but it's tough to find the time to play it.

Cool theme, but what serious Thrash bang gives a shit about fame? Should be brutal. Thinkier than it looks with still massive swings of luck. Weird but I like it.

Please check out my rules guides in the forum and the concise rules file for the easiest way to learn this game.

This is a good light-medium weight dice-placement game where you play to get your band famous.  The metal theme is not overpowering (images are all cartoon-like) and this game should appeal to anyone interested in the general theme.

The board and the icons for each location are a little confusing but you should pick it up after a few rounds.  The rules aren't the best but with the included player aid/errata everything is there to get you playing fairly quickly.

Overall a good game with interesting mechanics and an amusing theme.  I also feature as a fan card.

While I love the theme and was excited about the dice placement mechanics, there is no denying that this game just feels incomplete. The scoring feels very strange and possibly broken. I think this was a fun idea in someones head, but not nearly enough work was done to make it an excellent game. This is highlighted by the fact that the company is rebranding and republishing the game in a different form only months after this game was released. Really a mess from top to bottom and not a game I'm happy to own. Another cautionary kickstarter tale sadly.

The components were just so horrible and the theme was not at all to my liking which made the game feel much worse then it probably is.

Another Kickstarter backed game.  Should be playing this before the end of 2015 if the publishers updates prove to be correct.  Looks like a fun game regardless of the thrash metal theme.  I look forward to giving it a play.

The theme is fun.  I'm happy that the designers did not make another game about medieval merchants.  But it's long, and a bit of a brain burner for a dice game.  It's pretty frustrating to spend two hours building up an engine, and then wipe out on the dice roll for the last turn while your opponents clean up.

A good dice placement game with a theme that I really liked. Also, the mechanics mostly made sense and it was good fun playing it. However, the scoring phases and the possible actions and uses of the cards were a bit confusing. It could have been a little more polished. On a side note, I really did not like the artwork, but if the game is good I can look past that. I wish they made even another revision of this game, more polished and with great artwork. Would pick it up for sure.

This was the game I had the most fun with at Essen this year. The theme could have been any musical genre, but the publishers went with the local Polish scene. A great game, easy to learn and great theme, can say anything bad about this game = get if you can!! Hit Wars forevers.

Surprisingly fun game. The rules were hard to decode but once we started playing the theme carried them quite nicely and made errors seem illogical. 

A bit too long/slow for what it delivers and a tendency to snowball which makes players who have fallen behind feel left out brings down the score for me.

Played a two player game of this only thus far, hence why I give it a 6.5 rating.  Just really isn't that great with two.  I'm sure it's more enjoyable with more but not sure when I'll have the opportunity to try it with more.

RATING: 4
After first play, 4 players:

The dice mechanics are superb! To "fix" your rolls with support/fan/scandal-cards is really fun! 

However...

The game is waaay to long with four players, as you play 8 rounds (so everyone get to be start player twice). Took us almost 3 hours to complete...

The final scoring after the last round of the game is to put it mildly, convoluted:
First you lose VPs and skill tokens on your bandmembers for the scandal cards you have left. 
Then you score VPs for majorities of skill tokens on every type of bandmember (5 of them), scoring for first, second and third place for each type.
After that, all of a sudden you have a last concert (which gets you VPs for the concert, higher album placement (which can trigger new Hit Wars), VPs for Fan cards played during this concert mixed with how many skill tokens are on the band members,  and finally two fan cards (which you don't need, except in a Hit War, so being start player (or close) in last turn is a plus). 
After that you get VPs for what number your best album is on. 
Stefan Feld would be in awe....

This game could be so much better, if cleaned up by a good board game editor/publisher. It most certainally has some very nice ideas, but in it's current condition unfortunally smells Kickstarter, aka 90% complete.

One thing that bothered the heck out of all of us, was that when placing skill tokens on your band members, they cover the icons for what type the band members are. We had to put the tokens halfway outside the space to be able to know which band memeber was which. Very annoying! 
In Rahdos runthrough, with the prototype, this didn't seem to be and issue, as the icons where above the spaces!

I'm going to try this game a few more times, definetly with three players, but as of now the game is unfortunally on the lower part of mediocre...

KEEPER CHROME
I play in a band so find board games about rock music to be meh - Rockband Manager a typical example. But this one is so exuberant, created by Polish thrash metal fans and based on real bands, that you forgive them the usual gonzoid cartoon characters. In fact there is a good - maybe for rock fans great - game here, certainly enough to keep you entertained of an evening, and the routes to success are reasonably thematic. But best of all is the sheer look of the thing, with beautiful deep, vibrant colours and nice components.

Achter het leuke metal thema zit een spel dat ook gerust zou werken met een andere thema. Het spel zelf is leuk maar zeker geen klassieker. Er zijn ook teveel subregeltjes die zonder een player aid moeilijk te onthouden zijn. Verder zijn er leuke ideeën (Single - LP) maar ze missen wat logica. Ook de afrekening vond ik wat overdreven veel. Schandaalkaarten, fans van bandleden tellen en nog eens op tour gaan. Soit leuk maar geen klassieker.

2-4 player game were you take control of a 5 men Metal band trying to make it in the Rock Music industry - Improve your equipment, record singles n albumns , play gigs and go on tour - Watch out for the scandles though.
Dice placement victory points game - Looks fun will test in out as soon as possible

Played with 4 which took 3 hours - fun game with a great theme just felt there could have been a bit more to this game

Diceplacement is one of my favorite things. Game looks interesting, though the theme a bit of a miss for me personally. It's not a super big deal, but might be for other people, so could be hard to convince others to play it.

This game has plenty of problems, but the theme saves it for me. The only thing that can be really bothersome about it is the dice rolling, which have just a tad more randomness than I would like. I've been toying with the idea of replacing the d6 you roll for singles, albums, and touring with a d4 to minimize it a bit. Aside from that, I really enjoy this game quite a bit. It simulates the rise to stardom as a rock/metal band in a pretty family-friendly package.

The artwork looks a bit cheap, but the game itself is really engaging and full of choices. Feels quite thematic also, despite being worker placement/resource conversion engine. Runs a bit long with four players, but nothing too bad since it did not feel like it was dragging or anything.

Rules are horrendous ... even after reading "updated rules", I am far from impressed.

Terribly organized ... mired in mechanics and mechanical terms instead of explaining in "game terms" and the reasons why one wants to move a token on a given track for example.  They may be acceptable for a reference document once you know how to play (although that remains to be seen) but one of the worst I have seen for trying to learn from.

Iconography is terrible and not at all intuitive.

Graphic Design is painful - Why do Green and Red Cards have symbols on card face showing the deck they are from but Blue do not ?

I did try watching a video explantion ... which is marginally better but is basically a regurgitation of the rulebook ... with terrible camera work.  When explaining areas of the board, a lot of the time the camera was too zoomed out to even see the icons being referred to ...

It is a real struggle trying to learn enough to play ... potentially more effort than the game warrants !

Caveat Emptor !

Other than a single play solo (running two bands) this never got to the table. Horrible rules that don't make sense, a really awful kickstarter, and poor, drab printing killed this for me. A dog's dinner of a game. Sold May 2016 just to see it gone from my sight.

This game needs a second edition. BADLY! The rules are so poorly written it took me three hours of scouring the BGG forums just to get some vague answers to my questions. Even with the official errata, it's still a complete mess. The theme is amazing but the game feels clunky, unfinished, unnecessarily complicated, and to me is a prime example of a Kickstarter that hasn't been sufficiently playtested. A missed opportunity.

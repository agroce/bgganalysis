This is a game I want to love, but just don’t. The components are great, the hidden orders create excellent tension, and it’s a conflict rarely covered, which is always a plus for me. That said, something about the way the game plays feels less than the sum of its parts. It’s nice to have a 3-player option, but it’s not a game I’d make a point to try to get a group together for, especially considering the playtime for the longer scenarios. For me, this game is a starting pitcher who goes 14-12 with a 4.25 ERA . . . he’ll get the job done most of the time, but rarely if ever wow you.

RATING: 6.5
A multiplayer wargame that works well. The system is a little convoluted (turns are broken into phases, not months or seasons or anything like that), but there are many choices to make and it can be challenging to achieve your goals, as you can never do everything you want to do -- and sometimes, [b]need[/b] to do.

Scenario 2 is unwinnable for the Polish and made me think about this game. It looks that is works very nice in balanced game situations, but where you are behind you are fighting against the odd.

Then the cards adds a lot of randomness. When you are in the lead you can easily absorb some losses. However this does not go for the opponent, unless you are playing a scenario where you can retreat to gain some time.

Any city will fall with the Russian heavy artillery card. An automatic 2 SP loss is too much and does not take the terrain type into account. Whether it is a fortified city or open terrain ... it doesn't matter.

I have only played the first scenario, so the rating may fluctuate some.

Regardless, the components are gorgeous and although the rules are simple, the game itself is very tense and is full of difficult and meaningful choices.  So far, it's an extraordinarily rich experience.

Uses order placement very much like A Game of Thrones.

I've played Hammer of the Scots a few times and I enjoy it, but this is the only block game (with hidden units) that I own.

Edit: played a few games now, but I haven't been able to get it to the table. Good game.

First Impression: This block wargame has wonderful components and a gorgeous map. Placing hidden commands for your units introduces tension and a bluffing element to the game. The card-based combat system was interesting but didn't seem to enhance the game any more than using dice. I've only played this game two-players so far but would really like to experience the 4 player dynamics.

This game superbly combines three different fog of war mechanics:
Cards, which contains operation points and events unknown to the other players
Placement of Order Markers to activate troops and designate them in attack, defense, or movement
Block, which conceal the units type and strength to the enemy
Brilliant!

A beautiful game with a simple block FOW mechanic that makes bluffing an integral part of the system.  I had a lot of fun and would recommend it newcomers to the wargamming hobby.

RATING: 9
Almost the perfect wargame.
Super tense and deep gameplay, but it is unfortunately marred by 2 things:
The victory conditions are totally unbalanced for several scenarios and the campaign game.
The rules sacrificed clarity for shortness and while this makes them very easy to learn, it does also sometimes bring confusion when complex situations arise.

Hopefully Academy Games will soon adress both points so I can raise my rating to a full-blown 10 
(update - THey have now clarified the rules, but the balance problems remain)

A decent block game. Only played it twice and we felt that the rules could use a bit more scrubbing, but it was fun to play. My only major complaint is that none of us ever felt it prudent to play a card for the historical event. We might have to house rule this and have the event go off automatically.

Buen juego de bloques y sobre un tema rarete.

El juego brilla a 4 jugadores y es simple reglas pero profundo en decisiones.

Le lastra solo un par de cosillas, las manos de cartas no terminan de estas compensadas, habia que haber distribuido los mazos por épocas y luego que hay un par de ambiguedades en el reglamento que ni editor ni autor han clarificado.

RATING: 6
My initial enthusiasm for this game - which was strong - has softened quickly on contact with the rules. My original fear about the game was that it was a mix of every available fog-of-war game mechanic - CDG-style strategy cards, blocks, hidden order chits - and it might turn out to be an incoherent mish-mash. While I don't think that's entirely true, on the other hand the large number of systems has led to a lot of them being insufficiently well defined. Good luck figuring out overstocking in many cases, for example. The situation with the Lithuanian blocks in several scenarios is very confusing and inadequately defined. Not enough attention was paid to explaining some confusing game mechanisms. Overall, the rules are just too loose.

I think the scale is also somewhat wrong. Players just have to manage too many blocks. We could have probably made do with half the scale - half the blocks and half the areas. As it is, players do too much micromanagement and too much game information (roads, terrain, garrisons) is hidden by too much clutter. I think there needed to be less.

Still, a good try which is fun to play at times, but not there.

Playing Hint: The 4-player scenarios really need 4 players. Because of the scale issue, having one player play two fronts to make a three player game is really overwhelming for that player. There are just too many bits to manage. I'd stick with the recommended player set for scenarios, meaning the game doesn't really work with 3.

RATING: 8
I'm not a wargamer, but I have a budding interest in some of the more approachable games in that category. That has caught my interest in various titles from Academy Games, which seems to specialize in wargames with streamlined rules.

I picked up Strike of the Eagle on a whim after reading some glowing reviews, and after one play I'm certainly pleased so far. The game is hidden blocks with secret orders and point-to-point movement. You get victory points for eliminating units that can't retreat, by cutting off units from supply, by capturing cities, and by winning "big victories."

As a relative non-wargamer, the first game was a learning game, and I severely underestimated the defend orders. I'm eager to try this again, and now that maybe I have a sense of what to do, my rating might even rise a bit.

Update: Sold this off after not seeing it hit the table. Two-player-only games are hard for me to get to the table, and I instead see myself lobbying to get some other titles to the table instead of this one.

Update: I ultimately traded this away. I've got limited bandwidth for two-player only games, and I'd rather play Conflict of Heroes or other titles. Alas.

A really good wargame that even beginners of the genre can learn to appreciate, play and enjoy. Has some interesting and fun game mechanics and the combat is easy enough for anyone to get into right away. I'm also very fond of how the game utilizes hidden troops - it keeps the tension high compared to when you know where your opponent only has troops deployed and where his/her cannons are stationed.

A very interesting system. Hand management is key, as is understanding the how the quasi-deterministic battle system works. The cards offer lots of unpredictability and replayability, and so far the game seems well-balanced and tight. The gameplay is full of tactical nuances that revolve around initiative and order placement, and the rules, although straightforward take time to sink, since the game is different in many respects from other block wargames. Thus, the first 1-2 games will probably be written off as learning games, and will last much longer than suggested times.

I am looking forward to explore the system further, and also playing 4-player. A very interesting system, and overall an exciting and not too complex game. Recommended.

RATING: 7
Two to four players try to gain the upper hand in the Polish-Russian war that followed WWI. It is a semi-card driven block war game with point to point movement along roads and rail roads. Each card can be used in four different ways: increase the number of orders you can give during an operation phase, increase strength in battle, recruit new soldiers at the end of a round, or use the specific historic flavour of the card. Hard decisions on how to use your cards are the logical consequence. When you run out of cards, you can still play (therefore semi-card driven), but you are severely handicapped against a player who's still holding some cards in his hands. The armies are quite simple, with only infantry and cavalry blocks. Orders are distributed over locations in a Game of Thrones like hidden way.

2015-07-16 : I saw this game for the first time back at Spiel 2010 - some Polish guys were there with a super-sized version of a block wargame on a point-to-point map called The Eagle and the Star. It looked like something that would interest me so I stopped to talk to them. They were very pleased somebody actually knew about what is really an obscure and virtually unknown war in the West. They were looking for a publisher to get wider distribution and I remember thinking "good luck with that given the subject". But they did it. Academy Games picked them up and 5 years later I'm actually playing the game in a very good-looking production.

Ok, about the game : It's a very streamlined relatively quick-playing low/medium complexity game where you spend most of your time thinking about your tactics & strategy instead of leafing through the rulebook looking up combat & movement modifiers. This is a game of maneuver and bluffing/out-thinking your opponent, not about calculations to get the perfect combat odds. I literally didn't even have 2 dozen units and I worried about each and every one of them on what orders I would give (or not) - made me really feel like the army's commander and that's what wargaming is all about.

Looked good, played well, with some unique modifications to the block game mechanics.  The strategic importance of supply combined with a combination of versatile cards that, while limited in supply, can be used to improve most situations, made for a very thoughtful game.

RATING: 6
The brilliance here is the hidden order system layered on top of the already hidden units. You and your opponent can see all of each other's (hidden) units on the board but you don't know which ones are going to be activated and in which way. Some of the orders are "from here" or "to here" and some are merely feints, so you really don't know. You place orders one by one, back and forth and the tension mounts as you see where your opponent is placing them. 

If you anticipate an attack, you might want to change what you were planning to do -- though it could very well be a bluff. Then when you go to resolve the orders, the player with initiative declares who will activate first. This can have huge ramifications for pinning units or getting to a destination first. All of this creates a fantastic fog of war.

The game's weak points are the lack of diversity in scenarios. You either have very short 2 round ones or extremely long ones. Could use some medium length ones such that playing cards for reinforcements comes into play but don't require a full day to play out. I've also heard complaints of balance.

This is a brilliant game,  the production value is top notch with a beautifully crafted giant map and high quality counters.  We have played several two player games and each one has been decided by 1 victory point!  The game balance is terrific and the supplied scenarios have been very enjoyable.  

Playability is excellent, the game mechanics are easy to learn.  The manipulation of the cards and orders is the heart of this game. Do you sacrifice cards for a winning edge in a battle? When do you spend a card for reinforcement blocks, potentially sacrificing needed orders?  

This game is a 10 except for two very minor quibbles:
1. The lack of a Zero on the Victory Point track
2. The use of "irregardless" in the rules. Apologies for this one, a pet-peeve of mine, the word does not exist.

Re-edition of The Eagle and the Star with some slight changes in rules and a significant improvement in aesthetics. 

A great Card Driven wargame with secret orders placement, plenty of choices and replayable as hell. Battles are solved without dice. The campaign is really long but it's unbalanced favouring Bolsheviks. Plenty of scenarios. Awesome, with a peculiar flow and mechanics.

Strike of the Eagle represents the Polish - Soviet War of 1920, the "Miracle of the Vistula" war. It’s a CDG with surprising depth. Of course, each card may be put to multiple uses, which is normal enough. But there are more uses for the cards than a typical player has cards. So tense situations abound. 

First, the cards may generate random events or they may generate reinforcements at a future time or they can supplement combat strengths during a battle or lastly, they could generate additional order tokens. 

Second, players start off each phase with a limited number of order tokens, which represents a commanding general’s instructions to his troops. If card play is the key to this system, then the proper usage of the few tokens you get is its lock. Because without being activated by one of these orders, units may not move. 

Orders also allow players to conduct reconnaissance, railroad units, March or Force March units "Here." March or Force March units away from "Here" or re-organize a unit, that is reinforce an out-of-action unit. As these order tokens are placed face down on the map, in any order and one at a time in an IGO-YUGO manner, players have any number of opportunities to introduce a rather large Fog of War element into each game. 

For example, you could issue a number of re-organization and recon orders on your left flank in the hope your opponent assumes your main push will fall there. With a little luck your opponent might even be induced to waste an order force marching reserves in that direction. 

Unfortunately for your trusting opponent, order tokens are placed on the board face down and one at a time. And, as you could have generated more orders than your opponent by burning useless event cards for their order token value, the sophisticated player could have gamed the situation by waiting until his opponent had placed his last order, before plunking down a "March Here" order on his right flank. 

In other words, your opponent could have been left completely in the dark as to your intensions, even though he possessed a God’s Eye View of the battlefield. That’s not an effect most wargames can reproduce. 

This is a superior game, however, I've only played it twice, so consider this a provincal rating. I expect that after 4 or 5 more plays my rating will be moving up. 

For a more complete statement on games we checked out at the WBC see our site "The Boardgaming Life."

Update: I've increased my rating to 9.5 after another 3 or 4 plays. I don't normally rate a game a "10" unless I've repeatedly played it over a number of years with all sorts of opponents. So consider this the highest possible rating for a new game. Yes, it's that good.

A mechanically solid game that combines block game mechanics, secret orders, and cards.

My first game was ok, I'm not a huge block wargame fan and the game felt a bit static for me. I am also getting tired of everyone using the ops/event CDG mechanic. We played teams and there wasn't much team play. That could have just been us since it was my first others' second play. Overall a well designed game, but a bit boring for me.

Rating based on the components alone. Beautiful. 
I'm curious about how it plays. 

UPDATE
Played it yesterday night, the tutorial scenario. 
Interesting but we did stuff wrong, I'm sure the next time we'll have all the things straight. 

REASON TO KEEP: it is a simple up to three player (even 4, but three seems optimal) wargame. There are not that many around! :)

UPDATE
Re-played once again. This time I appreciated the game more. 

The heart of the game is attrition: attrition of cards, attrition of troops. By the end of my second-fought Small Wars scenario, I had a paper thin line between the Poles and my key cities. The Poles were spent as I was. If you have an early advantage, it will be pretty difficult to lose it. Overall Initiative is very important to have.

As for now I have never played for reinforcements, nor for Historical Events, it just seems too punishing to do so, if the other player decides to go for Orders. 

I like it, but I'll reserve my definitive answer after I've played a longer scenario. 

UPDATE
I was keeping this because I thought it could work as a 3-player wargame. I was wrong. Seeing this I traded it. 

By no means it is a bad game, but it is long and frankly I believe there are more fun wargames for me out there.

I like games that emphasize the fog of war, as block games do.  For this game, I further like that the method of placing and resolving order chits allows the enemy "to have a vote" (as they say in our Army) wrt the fulfillment of your own orders.  I find, however, that so many events are so useful that one is positively starved for regular ops (in a way that doesn't happen in, say, Twilight Struggle).  In future games, I will recommend to my opponent that we both get an extra card each turn; if that isn't enough, I would even try two extra!  I know it's meant to constrain you with tough choices, but I still think the game as designed is too stingy with ops.

Awesome game!

An incredible innovative block wargame, with such easy rules giving you tons of strategy.
The card implementation is incredible because it gives you options.. first you don't have to play a card.. you can simply use your regular orders & save the card for later use, second you can use every card in 4! different ways.. either reinforcements, extra orders, a better battle value or an event. The turn order or rather Initiative swings with won or lost battles, wich makes planning sooo important.
Combine that with the incredible richness of having all those different orders at your disposal.. the bluffing & out-smarting possibilities are legion..

This game i'll recommend to everyone who loves deep, rich, beautiful & theme-dripping strategy games!

_______

Granted there are one or two rules that feel a bit strange, but in the end they make sense game-balance-wise. (concerning VPs for Key Cities &  out-of-supply unit elimination)
The two fronts can feel a bit seperated aswell, but as you get a deeper understanding of the game, you start weaving the neighbouring front into your strategies.

________

Dropped down to 7.
Reasons i think are:
a 4 player game feels like two 2 player games, to an extent where i asked myself are these other two even in the same round than we are?
and in a two player game the whole map becomes a grognard size & the two player scenarios lack variability. After you're third game you know the keypoints of the map & they're never changing.

______________

up to 8 again.. don't know what it is.. if i haven't played it in a while i think.. nah.. it's okay.. but once i play it i think MAN THIS IS GOOD..
Although the game is relatively simple it's a game that needs to be played by wargamers.

RATING: 8.5
Played three scenarios of this in a single sitting upon opening it, which I reckon is a pretty good recommendation right there.

There have been some rules questions on the forums but none of those really came up in practice. Had to consult the rules on a few nuances, mostly around retreating and overstacking.

The order limitations and card hand sizes are brutal and give a nice tension. The order limitations means there's a strong incentive in the first few turns to create large(r) stacks of units than most scenarios start with.

Playing as the Soviets is also pretty angsty because your cards are simply, overall, worse. Guess that's what we get for playing a Polish designed game ;)

One niggling concern: in all three games the "defender" won. When I was the defender I won, when I was the attacker I lost; and vice versa for my opponent. Possibly that just means we need to get better at understanding the nuances of attacking.

One thing I think this game shows conclusively is how limited the IGO/UGO format. The introduction of simultaneous orders is hardly new, Diplomacy did it before over half a century ago, but it creates an almost vital element of Fog of War that no other "mere" block game can recreate.

I would even say that it needs *more* bluffing elements. Maybe have TWO mandatory recons? Not sure.....

I liked these three plays a lot. The best wargame of 2011 for me. I like it better than Sekigahara (my #2 of 2011).

My biggest concern so far is, not having played any of the "bigger" scenarios, is whether they are "too long" for my tastes.

Re-implementation of the Eagle and the Star with Leaders and Mounted Maps = Must have for me and a top 10 game (Eagle already was out of 600 for me, its rated a 9)

[u]Update:[/u] Just received my copy and tore the shrink off and talk about awesomesauce! Just beautiful, what a great job on all the components, even the cards are really nice quality TOP NOTCH ALL AROUND! 

Have not played this version yet but the differences are fairly small overall from the Eagle (read the rules couple of times) so for now I'll give it the same rating and paste my comments from that game below. Will update once I play this version, if anything my rating might go higher as it was likely going to anyway and now with the Leaders, more scenarios etc probably even more so. 

[u]Update:[/u] Have played this version 3 or 4 times now, really like it and Leaders are great touch, you can pull off some clever moves and there is a lot of sneaky planning and tactics at work here with flanking and the cards and such. 

The big negative is what I already mentioned about the rules having too many holes, even after clarifications there its swiss cheese, and the balance of some scenarios seem suspect, but these are not game breaking imo, rules can be logic'd out most times (though I am planning to email a list of questions to Uwe) and tweaking scenarios is no biggy if needed.  

The initiative is huge here, you really need to fight for it as it lets you control the flow of play and even how some battles will play out, you also see potential enemy moves first and get a chance to react, etc. Multiple ways to score VP's is a nice touch here, always giving you something else to consider. Great game, that so far I don't seem to be so good at not sure why, seems like my moves are too obvious and always get countered, and w/o initiative it really puts a damper on things, also thinking too offensively I miss incoming attacks which are often flanking me too, all bad play on my part 

==========

[i]Finally another GREAT wargame with no dice! (thank the lord, and Robert Zak) Almost everything is here that I would want in a wargame and low rules overhead with logical and intuitive rules to boot, a very short rulebook for this kind of game (much too short, there are MANY holes unfortunately). A card-driven block game with Fog of War and Supply lines, no direct comparisons I can think of but it combines several things from good games like Hannibal and Rommel and/or NT. TONS of options in play which I REALLY love, cards used in 4 different ways (orders, combat modifier, events or reinforcements), lots of different orders to give, 2 options on how to modify combat, movement options like rail, defense and withdraw plus more. The game definitely has some bluff and tension too as the orders given are done according to initiative and they are done FACE DOWN which makes it quite interesting and more realistic really. 

The only thing I would have liked to see would be tanks, planes and maybe ships (I know not part of this war) along with the units having more differences than just cavalry and infantry, like leaders having an effect on surrounding units, things like that [Edit-this wish came true-Thanks Uwe!]. Low luck overall, some card draw of course, a little in the combat but overall one of the lowest I have seen for a wargame like this, can't comment on balance at this point of course. That is a pretty small nitpick and the only one I can level here. Gameplay is exactly what I hoped it would be and right now this has the potential to overtake Hannibal and become my favourite wargame. 

Sidenote - IIRC, this does not have the delicious tension in cardplay from TS where you get stuck with a hand of crap and try to wiggle your way out of it (few games do though), I don't believe you get forced to play an opponent event or two like TS but could be wrong. Note that I think what it lacks in that specific tension, it has in it in other ways (FOW, simultaneous face down orders) and much more too, its also more of a "Wargame proper" than TS is and fills in most of those areas where TS lacks.[/i]

I really, really like this game. Although I'm not as blown away by the map as everyone else seems to be. It's too busy. And the names are too hard to read. (Thank you for the alpha-numeric grid to locate them.) Although dice-less (which I don't mind), a certain amount of randomness is added with the cards (which I do like). And could you have anymore freaking ways of playing a card!? These cards are great! I love this game.

RATING: 8
Very innovative system (initiative, orders, cards, supply), good quality of board/blocks/cards. The rules were meant to be simple - only 8 pages. But squeezing them was not a good idea, there's a lot of interaction between orders/cards etc. and only after 3 games you start to get the point. Besides the language used introduces a lot of confusion - players read the effects of the cards differently.

I lack the numbers of divisions which would make the battles unique, but there's enough "chrome" on the cards to get the historical feel. The situation in 1920 (balanced strenght, plenty of room for manouver) enables very dynamic campaign and many re-plays, each different from the previous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The more I appreciate the rules and gameplay, the higher this game goes in rating.  It truly takes on another level of complexity when you appreciate staying in supply, attempting to cut off your opponents supply, and using leaders appropriately to position units effectively out of supply to make the crucial moves.  It's not all about battle, it's about strategic moves and positioning.  The only thing limiting my rating is that the game does not scale well to 3 or 4 players.  A 4 player game is simply two separate 2 player games going on.  There is minimal to no interaction between sides.  For example, if I'm in the south and send a division to the north it becomes under the control of my teammate.  Then I'm done with him.  Secondly, there is only 1 or 2 areas on a given scenario where a coordinated attack from the north and south would be realistic.  And if two players tried to organize that they would need to communicate and then that would make it obvious to their opponents what their trying to do.  In my opinion, this game does not work for more than 2 players.

RATING: 7

- El juego es precioso y los materiales son de 10 (misma caja y calidades que Conflict of Heroes o 1775)
- Lo peor (bueno, regularcillo) es el manual: lo han querido hacer tan corto (8 páginas, uncluidos ejémplos) que se han pasado y hay cosas que no quedan claras.
- Es un juego para 4 jugadores separados en 2 bandos. Para menos jugadores hay escenarios pequeños de medio tablero o algún jugador tiene que asumir un rol bicéfalo.
- Mecánicamente es un Card Driven con mapa Punto a Punto, más parecido al Senderos de Gloria que al Washington's War (aunque con la baja complejidad del 2º), con cartas de múltiples usos: órdenes, combate, evento o reemplazos.
- Las unidades son bloques con distintos pasos de fuerza que sólo se muestran al contrario durante el combate o con la orden de Reconocimiento. Hay poca variedad de tropas: infantería, caballería y aliados.
- La activación de tropas se realiza mediante la asignación de órdenes ocultas (mecánica muy interesante, al estilo de Juego de Tronos, con toda la incertidumbre y faroleo que suponen). Cada turno tienes un Reconocimiento y otra a elegir (Movimiento hacia o desde, Marcha forzada hacia o desde, Defensa, Retirada, Reorganización y Ferrocarril). Si se juega una carta para órdenes, se consiguen ese nº de órdenes adicionales (2-4).
- Variedad de escenarios, con distintas duraciones, desde los introductorios de unas 2 horas hasta la campaña completa a 4 jugadores (calculo que 8 - 10 horas)

A fog of war block game with the element of surprise.  The surprise comes through the use of orders given to your troops and the limited card play you have per round.  Be careful not to exhaust all of your cards quickly as this could prove to be deadly to you.

Recreate the 1920 struggle between Polish and Soviets post WW1. It's a card driven block fog of war block game using a point to point map with hidden activation commands representing movement, force marches, retreats, recon, defend, and rail transport. Beautiful game, I highly recommend it. Rule book has some typos but game is solid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very nice components with top notch quality. Marco's Top 5 in 2011. An original system design by a Poles, the game is introduced to the international after some further developments.  The quality and art of the map, counters, box, cards are all top-notch, which are amusing to look at already. They certainly brought you back to the period at a time the Poles sought their independence while the Soviets came into power shortly. the world had just been revolutionized by human ideals and social advancements. Everything seemed plausible. 

5 operation phases, 6 cards, 4 blocks stacking. Smart detachment rules! The initiative rule is interesting - the one without the initiative reveals the card first for using it in one of the possible 4 ways, thus allowing the initiative player to change his mind in his own secrecy according to the new situations after looking at the card just revealed by the non-initiative player. The initiative player also gets to determine who is going to perform the order assignments to the units in the first place and then alternate the assignment thereafter.   

Mind you, reading the examples in the rulebook is a must in addition to the numbered rules because they give more information on how does the game work actually. If you just read the body of the rules, you might have played the game not the way intended originally.
  
Overall, the game system design is excellent, innovative, while conveying a sense of fog of war at minimum overhead.  The order system is used very well here to simulate the command system at operational level during WWI and shortly after.  The game calls itself being one in the "Fog of War" series, though it is currently not clear what will be next in the series.  The only score being knocked off for the possible dropping of the order counters from the blocks if the players are careless, a rather deterministic combat model (the higher the number of combat factors garnered wins the battle, no exception due to random CRT), and the system being applied to a historical battle (Russo-Polish War in 1919) whereas it is less popular so.  However, if you are open to a variety of subjects or being interested in the period, and without tanks, this is definitely the game for you. 

I learned a lot about the Russo-Polish War from this game.  It arouses me to read more about this war in its historical context of the Bolshevik rising and the spread of Communism at the infant birth of the Soviet Union.  I watched a good movie produced by the Poles - The Battle of Warsaw 1920. It increases my interest in the campaign even more.  In the movie, the cavalry charges in the face of machine gun shooting, bayonets spiking, rifle firing - really some telling moments.

RATING: 5
Notwithstanding anything else, I didn't feel a lot of tension in the game, and I can't pin my finger on it too well. To some extent it's because the system has been simplified almost to the point of being generic. Partly it's that the combat system feels bland. In any event, I never had that little electric tingle along my spine that something really exciting was about to happen. 

I'd like to try this again, ideally with the campaign scenario, or at least a much longer one, and I think it would be fun to try it with 4 players.

This has got some good potential, but the rules are an absolute mess. Examples that contradict rules; rules hidden in examples; rules and card text with multiple interpretations. 3 pages of rules questions (some with multiple pages) in 6 pages of forum posts, and the designer admits he hasn't made his mind up about some of the rules yet. Needs better play testing, development, and editing/proof reading. With a 2nd ed. ruleset, or a comprehensive errata sheet, this just might be worthy of the 8.88 rating it currently has. (Loses 2 points for rules.)

Essentially a block game on steroids, which in this case is a good thing.

The only problem are the rules. They are well written and are only 8 pages long but because of the short rules some of them can be interpreted differently but the designers are very active in the forums and all questions so far are answered.

After 6 plays (and 3 plays in its previous incarnation, The Eagle and the Star) this has become one of my favourite games.  It takes the fog of war, inherent with traditional block games, a considerable step further through its innovative order system.  Asymmetrical play, a diceless combat system and a bevy of scenarios make for endless replay value.  It plays just as well with 2, 3 or 4 players, although the 3-player (2 Soviets) is my favourite.  A great game.  The only fly in the ointment is the clarity of the rules, which do not adequately address all the situations that arise through the complex interactions of the diverse elements of the game.  A comprehensively updated version of the rules is promised shortly, however.

One of the best wargames I have played.  The command chit system, creating a "fog of war", is fantastic.  A player really has to take real conflict considerations into account.  In other words, you begin to think more like a real batttlefield commander, rather than some god who knows all the locations and capabilities of the enemy troops.  Adds a lot of tension and uncertainty to the game.  The battle resolution, with NO dice, is also a welcome change, and works quite well.  The game components are of very high quality. The historical notes, scenarios and game rules are very useful and easy to understand.  We have enjoyed all of the scenarios we have played.

My lack of knowledge/interest in the Russia-Poland War keeps this from getting a lot of repeat play. Having recently played Paths of Glory, it's easy to see where SotE borrowed some great concepts (ops/events/resupply). The hidden block/fog of war mechanic really sets this one apart. An outstanding game overall--from components to mechanics. My limited knowledge of Eastern European geography hurts the set up time which can be a bit onerous.

Third play cements this one in the excellent category. love the orders system and the bluffing aspect. Can't wait for The Fox and the Rats.

Epic block game with some nice twists. The orders system is very clever, and cards at a some dramatic variability (perhaps too dramatic).

Rating is based off a two-turn scenario. I'm not especially eager to try the full meal deal. There's no narrative arc to the game, so I doubt if the 4th hour will feel any different from the second hour. And I don't know that the four-play format adds anything besides scope and time.

RATING: 4
Despite owning The Eagle and the Star, I was interested in getting this game: the earlier game was brilliantly innovative, but in terms of the rules, card text and components, a bit of a mess. While I was attracted by Strike of the Eagle's improved components, I was particularly interested in the new scenarios that just take place on one front, which strike me as an excellent introduction. The leaders are an OK idea, but seem to be something one can easily live without.

Unfortunately, there are still numerous rules and card text ambiguities and  much discussion about the balance of the scenarios. One would have hoped that--on the second time out--such problems would have been dealt with. Indeed, some rules in the errata (e.g. on VPs) actually seem to add to the rules confusion. 

Until a new set of rules and a substantial card errata/faq comes out, this will sit on the shelf. This disappointment is also the reason for my low rating (esp. compared to my initial high rating for The Eagle and the Star).

Initial assembly sucks.  After that, I find the game to be a more complex, historically referenced and multi-dimensional version of Stratego!  Great fun for a Risk, Stratego, historical war game fan!

I feel I do not even have to try it out first to express an opinion. Flanking maneuver and bluff fest, huge map, up to 4 players, wooden blocks, short and to-the-point rulebook, scenarios and on top of all, diceless combat(with some random element however-still you can decide on the level of randomness at a cost). It will most probably become a favorite really soon.

UPDATE> Third reading of the rulebook. Many things not clear. Not good as it should be by a publisher like Academy.
UPDATE> New version rulebook. Downloaded it, let's see what happens.

I have Polish ancestry I want to learn more about.  I'm fascinated by any wargame attempting new mechanics.  I'm starved for games centering on conflicts neglected by past designers.  Great components aren't necessary, but they're always appreciated.  These reasons make this the ideal game for me.

But somehow it just isn't.

The neighboring fronts feel like two separate games that have nothing to do with each other.  Order placement is tense and watching your plans blow up in your face is a great aspect of this game, but the units and terrain don't give you anything to work with tactically.  Polish or Russian, the game plays out as a ground pounding grind.  Whether or not that reflects the conflict isn't as important to me as whether or not it's fun.  And this isn't for me.  It gets a 6 anyway because of the reasons mentioned above.

Really a solid card-driven wargame. I like the use of the cards to either help you in battle or to be able to take an action somewhere.

UPDATE: Got this back on the table after a long time, and really enjoyed the tension. The fog of war and action selection is fascinating, and the balance swung back and forth a couple of times, just making for an interesting and dynamic game.

This game has typical Academy Games components that are high quality.  The board is a work of art, although it can seem a little cluttered. The blocks are well produced and the information on them is easily discernible.  The background information to the war is excellent as is the scenario booklet. 

I've played all the scenarios and experienced the game 2, 3 and 4 player.  The more I've played it the more I've liked it and come to appreciate the wonderful system.  The game really shines when playing the campaign.  This is a great game, if you've got at least one opponent go buy it.  If you have two or three others in your wargaming group this is a must buy.  Highly recommended.

Wow.  This might be the first ten I've given to a game in a while.  I can't quite bring myself to it though.  That spot needs to be earned through repeated play and I haven't played enough Strike of the Eagle yet to warrant a ten.  But I have to say, this game is really good.  

At Gen Con, I sat down for a demo and Uwe Eickert himself was sitting across from me. I've played demo's with Uwe in the past, each of the last two years, I have sat down and played the new release of Conflict of Heroes. This year, I had to congratulate him on the success of that franchise but then we got in to the description of this game and let me tell you, it is a fantastic system. In this age of rehashed mechanics, I was shocked at the innovation of the order mechanic. It is simply beautiful to behold. 

Let me step back, I have played a few block games where the unit strength and type are hidden form the opponent so that is nothing new. In fact I think that feature isn't all that great. In game sense, it allows the player with the better memory to have an advantage, now that is fine if you are playing Memory, but it may not improve the game experience. So I wasn't real excited about this. I decided I want a demo because I enjoy Conflict of Heroes so much and I was hoping Uwe would again come through with a good design. In Strike of the Eagle, 'The Fog Of War' is more than the hidden blocks. The fog of war also applies to the order system, and this is where the game shines. Each turn each player has a number of order tokens they get to place. These tokens have one side with an icon for things like: Defend. Recon, Move in, Move out, Forced march in, Forced March out. The tokens are played face down alternating between players. After all the orders are placed, the player with initiative (which is won or lost based on battle results) decides who executes their 'Forced March' orders first. After forced march orders, are resolved, then recon and then Move orders are resolved. After all orders are revealed/resolved, the battles get resolved. (unit strength + a card flip + Mods like defend order, flanking, etc.). From my layman's description is seems ho hum, but the beauty is the cat and mouse high jinks. For example, your orders can have units moving out of an area before your opponent moves in with a large force, or you can 'forced march' a unit into an area to pin the opponent nullifying their move out. 

I was hooked during the explanation and floored during the demo. It was an instant purchase for me and I am getting more excited about playing it the more I type.

Very happy to see such an obscure topic covered in a major release like this. Outstanding production, but should have included an extra block or two to account for defects (i.e., there are no spares).

Fog of War system relatively easy to learn and fluid. A few too many rules and card issues, but this can be expected for the first title in a new series. Campaign game is imbalanced and broken, however (Poles can't win).

Low solitaire value, but higher than average ftf value.
Excellent box cover, too.

The FoW series looks promising, but this release needs some rules mending before I commit to any more titles.

I think this may be the pinnacle of all block games.

I was pulled in by the theme, which is a pretty obscure (to most Americans) conflict: the Polish-Soviet conflict of 1922. Yeah, WW1 ended in 1918, but the world wasn't all bliss until the rise of the dictators and the lead up to WW2. Especially in Eastern Europe, a lot of things were ironing themselves out, with brand new nations fighting border skirmishes and outright wars of expansion to make their presence known and claim what they thought was the full extent of their rightful territories. Other nations (sometimes the same ones at different points) found themselves fighting to defend their territorial integrity, or perhaps even their right to exist. This isn't a story of good-guys and bad-guys; the Polish actually did their fair share of land grabbing, posturing, and provocations during this period. But, when stacked against the new global pariah that was to become the incipient USSR, there sure were plenty of future bad guys present: Lenin and Stalin, being the primary examples.

This game is epic and really lives and breathes its subject. So much historical flavor has been added that calling it "flavor" or "theme" does a disservice to the designers. They really built a system around simulating the aspects of conflict that interested them,  then they custom-tailored that system to best suit the period and the conflict in question, then they engineered the game around all of that. History and conflict simulation are at the heart of this game. There's a lot of attention to detail, but just like any good piece of history they've been selective about what to include and what not to include.

The scale and scope of the game are very ambitious. The board is HUGE. There are tons of blocks. It's impressive to get this one out on the table, especially for the full campaign. There are also a whole bunch of scenarios to accommodate a gentle introduction into the games systems: a basic learning scenario, and then a few more advanced scenarios that bring in leaders and some other features, all trying to highlight learning how those systems work and how they matter in gameplay strategies.

The game systems themselves are an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink conglomeration of mechanics, including not only just about every block game concept, but also CDGs. And it's all very well done, tightly integrated, and with a minimum of rules. It works! How? Well, take the best Columbia Block games and breed them until you get all of the best features consolidated in a single game. Then, put it in a cage and force it to mate with Twilight Struggle. Then expose it to radiation until it develops some completely novel, but highly desirable mutations. Behold: Strike of the Eagle.

The rule book is deceptive. At 9 pages, it doesn't seem any deeper than Julius Caesar or Crusader Rex (Columbia Games). But there's so much going on in those 9 pages. Cards can be played for one of any 6 ways. Yes, SIX. You can play them for orders (like Hammer of the Scots), use them in combat for their combat modifier (sort of like in Friedrich), for reinforcements (like a few already mentioned games), or for the event (like in Twilight Struggle). But, the events have different types: historical events that resolve immediately during the card phase and can affect the whole turn, battle events that can be used at the beginning of a battle to influence the battle's outcome (in addition to playing cards for combat value), and reaction cards that as counter-effects, and can be used in a way similar to Instant spells in Magic the Gathering. 

Combat itself is deterministic, similar to Bonarparte at Morengo or its big brother Napoleon's Triumph, but with the card-modifier aspect thrown in. Movement is point-to-point, but with options for both road and rail movement. Supply is important and controlling/cutting-off supply is a crucial strategic focus of the game. Logistics will make this as much a game of movement and maneuver as anything else, but there will also be the moments where the time has come for large stacks of blocks to crash into each other and slog it out. All the finesse of operational strategy, but without losing the potential for colossal clashes over key areas that can only be won through a war of attrition, with victory going to the side willing to sacrifice and risk the most. But winning such a clash is a liability as much as a triumph as now they must follow up on that victory and make good on costly success. Failure to capitalize on a breakthrough (or over-reaching) can be disastrous.

The best and most novel part of this game, to me anyway, has to be the hidden orders. All block wargames (exception: Commands & Colors, so, OK all operational and strategic level bock wargames) use fog of war. Only the player can see the unit information on their units. Group of 4 blocks moving your way? That could be anywhere from 4-16 in total combined strength points. Are they infantry? Some cavalry? All cavalry? Are leaders present? You might have a vague idea from past engagements with some of the blocks, but you certainly don't have perfect information. This is what is great about block games. But the Fog of War series system in Strike of the Eagle takes that strength and expands upon it (actually, takes it back to the original idea in Quebec, where both players secretly wrote down orders and then executed them simultaneously). 

Orders tokens are placed face down, by both players, alternating. OK, he's doing SOMETHING with that group of blocks, but what? Will they move out? Will they withdraw (pull back in anticipation of an attack), will they prepare to defend (dig in)? They might be reorganizing (heal strength points), or perhaps they are going to move by rail or forced march? There are 9 orders in all! Each useful and realistic. Recon lets you scout out enemy units to get a look at the blocks so you know what you're up against. Recon also allows you to fake out the opponent by making it look as though this could be an attack coming their way. Another nice touch is that in addition to move out (divergent, area-impulse based group move) there are move-to (convergent, area-impulse based group move, like the "muster" movements in Crusader Rex). 

All in all, TONS of options and flexibility to move and maneuver your forces and get inside your enemy's OODA process (the military decision making process of Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act). In the popular vernacular: you can really fuck with his head in this game! After the mind-fuck, you can effectively and unexpectedly launch a grand maneuver to hit him where he's most vulnerable while parrying whatever moves he's already committed to (but which you've masterfully ensured would all be for naught). Add to this the fact that the map is well designed to give room for lots of big sweeping movements, but not without producing (simulating) real-world logistical concerns, and this becomes something of a true masterpiece in terms of design. The combat system also simply, but nicely, includes rules that allow for devastating flanking moves and encirclement, as well as problems such as a city being fortified, but only from a certain direction.

Wow. Lots going on there? You bet. Tough choices. Lots of options. So, so many options. Difficult command decisions. Very deep hand management. Lots of chance at work, but doesn't feel random, because everything is going to ride on how you play your cards and when. Best of all: combat resolution is quick, simple, unpredictable, and without multiple rounds of rolling buckets of dice. 

Components are stunning. Some of the best in any game I own and setting, by far, the new standard for block games. Full color, glossy rules. Rules are very precisely and concisely written with lots of examples and pictures. Index at the back and easy to reference. Player aid sheets break those rules down very nicely--everything from turn sequence to combat resolution procedures, along with references to where to find the relevant sections in the full rules. Tokens are really nice and thick and made of durable cardboard with a nice tactile matte finish. The blocks are a bit thinner than Columbia games, and this means they are less likely to crowd the board. 

Hard to speak too highly of this game. So glad I got it and I can't wait to see the next in Academy Games' "Fog of War" series.

Decent good system, not to mention the period. Sadly however, some ambiguities in the cards lower the rating somewhat. Few errors and some cards that appear not quite fit to the revised system (apparently inherited from the original design but not adopted to the current one). Designer should pay a bit more attention to the card texts in next game of the series.

Trouble is that albeit it is not game of blitzkrieg, there is too few cards to activate forces and perform other things.

Strike of the Eagle is the first game in the Fog of War series of block games to be published by Academy Games.
The year is 1920. World War I has ended, but the battle for Europe has just begun. The Soviet leaders, Lenin and Trotsky, plan to spread the workers’ revolution by blasting through Poland in order to support the growing communist movements in Germany, France and Britain. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Therefore, these armies to invade the Soviet Republics.
Strike of the Eagle is an operational level block game that allows the player to experience the tension of the Polish-Soviet War of 1920. This mobile war featured a return of sweeping cavalry attacks combined with new weaponry innovations such as planes, tanks and armored cars.

The heart of the Fog of War series lies in players placing secret orders on the map to bluff, mislead and outplay their opponents! The composition of each player’s wooden block armies remain hidden from their opponent until they are engaged in battle. Combat is resolved without dice, maximizing skillful play! Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle’s resolution.
Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.
Strike of the Eagle is based on The Eagle and The Star. This English edition has been totally reworked from the ground up with an expanded mounted map, new cards, streamlined rules, new army and leader blocks, new scenario setup rules and additional scenarios.

Very nice game. The one I liked the most of the wargames played so far. 

You attack/defend cities with infantery or cavalerie. You fight battles without dice (points from your blocks, cards, defense)

You get 2 actions standard (one has to be reckon) but you can get more by plaing a card. But watch out, you only get 6 cards in one round (consisting of 5 moments) and you use those cards for battles or as reaction cards.

Excellent balance of simple mechanics and rules, yet immense tactical depth. Fog of war combined with orders placement takes both mechanics to a new level. Multiple scenarios are there to keep it interesting. Love this period in history.

Have played 3 times. Trick is that it seems to bog down--especially in 4-player. Think it holds the most potential as a 2-player slugfest over multiple sessions.

Nice blend of card-driven (ala PoG) and block game with hidden orders.  Plays pretty smoothly.  We had a few rule look-ups that slowed things down (and the rule book has enough vague spots that we had to make our best guess on some things), and I'm sure we would play Scenario 1 in less than an hour next time.  The small number of cards per turn is an interesting constraint.  Positive initial reaction.

Rules need to be tightened up and clarified.

A nice game on an interesting conflict.  I love the order markers, I wish more games would adopt this mechanic.  I liked the diceless combat.  The issue is the pace is too slow.  With 5 operational phases and only six cards, which can be used for movement, events, reinforcements or battles, it's just not enough.  I like lots of decisions when I play, and while the decisions here are hard and interesting there just are not enough of them.  Having cards give half orders or even one order if played for their event might help a little.

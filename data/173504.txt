Hasta el momento  GTS es mi sistema favorito para juegos operacionales de WW2ª, la version 2.0 de las reglas no ha hecho sino mejorar el sistema, y aunque la escala del juego es enorme, es totalmente jugable entre varios jugadores. Los desembarcos son muy tensos, y un juego en si mismo.

GTS is an outstanding company level simulation.  Adam is very responsive with support - his response time should be the envy of any game designer.  So much thought and attention to detail went into this.  Playing the full campaign game (see my session reports).  Highly addictive.  Why not a 10?  No game is perfect.  This is as close as I've seen for an operational level game.   ASL is as close as I've seen for a tactical simulation.   Buy this - you won't regret it.

Stunning graphics. Beginning to play

[11/15] Played almost of the the Intermediate scenarios and below. Great improvement from GTS1.1
It used to have a a lot dice rolling. They are greatly reduced now because of In Command Rally, 2 rounds Assault. The game flows better because of elimination of Arty and Ind. activation.

Stundenlanges Suchen nach den richtigen Chips. Ich habe 2 Stunden lang sortiert und danach hatte ich keinen Bock mehr diesen Mist zu spielen. Keine Ahnung, wer sich so einen Quatsch ausdenkt und die Spielvorbereitungen so unverschämt bescheuert gestaltet. Größte Fehlinvestition ever. Spielt lieber Conflict of heroes, ist bedeutend günstiger und wesentlich besser, als die vollkommen bescheurte Plättchensucherei.... mir fehlen gerade so die Worte....

A real masterpiece of gaming engineering. This forth game in the Grand Tactical Series (GTS) is quite the undertaking. With very clear well written rules, counters that are artistically functional and a map set that is the envy of the hobby, your in for a real treat. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

RATING: 9
Follows in the footsteps of the excellent Market Garden GTS games and just as good. A few minor tweaks to the system but still feels the same as before. The core mechanics are fairly straightforward but this is a LOT of game if you take on the campaign. Highly recommended for multiple players if you want any hope of playing the campaign in a single lifetime.
Plenty of other "campaign light" scenarios, though, of varying physical size so accessible to everyone with an interest in the topic.

This is an auto-buy for me. Previous Grand Tactical Series games have been beautiful and the rules are elegant.  

Pre-ordered on Day 1 (D-Day?) -- 19 Feb 2015. Arrived Sep 2015.

The campaign game is massive, but there are several 1-map scenarios. I was a bit cheesed off that they could only put the 2.0 version rules that changed in the exclusive rules, rather than just update the damn rulebook. Oh well, the game looks good, and my plays of the smaller intro scenarios have shown the system to be pretty fun.  Although the Naval Invasion System is a bear to get through!  More later once I get further into the game.

RATING: 9.5
MMP's Grand Tactical Series goes to Normandy, yielding more coherent battles than the Market Garden games in this series.  As ever, the superb CRT and clever combat resolution system allow the interaction of numerous weapon classes with both armored and unarmored targets with little complexity and not too much wristage (2 to 3 rolls per shot).  Despite all the weapon classes and the two target classes, the ranged-fire combat system requires little memorization because both the units ratings and the CRT rows (firers) and columns (targets) are color coded with matching background colors.  Just match colors, apply a few modifiers from the list below the CRT and shoot.  In short, the combat system plays out much more simply than a quick read of the rules would lead one to suspect. As a result of all this design cleverness, land combat of medium-high complexity is handled with the effort of a medium-low complexity game.  You really can fight a couple of divisions at the company level through a turn in 1/2 hour.

Color coding extends to divisions and their regimental sub-formations, both of which are activated by chit pull.  The command and dispatch points that let division commanders control which regiments they maneuver each turn yield a snafu rate realistic for WW II.  You never know how many points you'll be getting each turn, and when you run out your staff becomes overwhelmed and stops issuing orders to regiments.  The units don't move and you look like a fool in front of Monty or Rommel.  Sure sounds like what the division commanders reported for that campaign!

The rules are chatty but clear and precise and cover each element everywhere you might think to look it up, so they're long but not hard.  Materials are the usual wonderful MMP quality with an easy-on-the-eyes map and color coded dots for the hex centers that link nicely to the terrain effects chart.  The pieces are also nice.  I appreciate having German symbols on German pieces and British symbols on British pieces.  Those who miss NATO symbols will be doubly grateful for the color coded weapon types and the great vehicle silhouettes and the ID guide inside the rules cover.  You're never at a loss for what a unit is and what it can do.

I've played the training scenario, one introductory scenario and one intermediate scenario (1/2 map, 3 divisions, 18 turns).  The latter plays out in a day.  I've not yet tried any of the invasion scenarios nor the full campaign with its 4 maps.  The invasion adds considerably more rules, but the campaign appears straightforward except for the table space and time required.  Someday.

RATING: 8.5
The stunning components, number of scenarios, support by the company, etc., are all top notch.  Once you get your head wrapped around the system the turns play much faster and there are a massive number of decisions that need to be made each turn.  I have not played the full campaign game, but the invasion scenarios and multi-map games work well.  Overall, it is an outstanding effort for those who want to take the time to learn the system and/or play monster games.

The only quibble I have is the same issue that afflicts all of the more comprehensive Normandy games in that you have to spend a lot of time learning rules for the airborne and amphibious assaults, then those rules aren't used after the first few turns of June 6th.  It's almost like learning two games systems to play one, which may be a problem for some gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Magnificent in every way. The historical research, the generous selection of scenarios (real effort went into their depth and variety), the production values, and GTS 2.0 itself (superior to 1.1, not just for the new assault procedure but for fixing how independent units activate). You get it all here: airborne operations, combined arms smash-ups, knife-fights and brawls, and of course the seaborne invasion. Something for everyone. And support from the designer is about the best I've ever seen. Surpasses TDC/WED.

RATING: 9
After a thoroughly amazing game  of The Devil's Cauldron and Where Eagles Dare, my gaming group demanded that this one appear on the table. The system has been tweaked a little from the earlier game and there are, understandably, a load of special rules - largely focused around the aspects of the amphibious landing.

The package is well put together and some lessons have been learned from earlier games in this series. For example a simple touch that really helps is the listing of the special rules needed for the scenario being played. For example the gamer is not forced to read the 56 pages of Exclusive Rukes to find the 3 paragraphs needed for the introductory scenario (The Black Baron). The package also introduces one quickly to the invasion itself and covers all three beaches in their own discreet scenario.

As a comment, while this is a monster game and will really benefit those with space, the scenario listing provides options that can be played in hours. These scenarios can be played on very small map sections. This scenario based approach allows the first week of the Normandy invasion to be covered in small chunks for those that don't have the space or time for a full campaign.

It is easy to see why this series is developing an extremely loyal following.

RATING: N/A
This is a great product.  It includes unique types of actions (amphibious landings, airborne assaults) but the situation  also affords both sides opportunities to attack and defend.  The wide variety of units - including both good and not-so-good ones - also makes it interesting.  The large number of stand-alone scenarios in addition to the larger campaign games makes this a good value for a gamer.  Highly recommended.

Good Points - Very playable monster. The rules have some issues but there is a lot of support for this series and it isn't loaded down with needless chrome. I find the rules to be second-nature after a couple of turns.
Graphics. This game is a work of art. The earlier games in this series were okay but this game takes it to a different (and better level).
Lots of Scenarios. If you are going to release a game this huge, you had better have some interesting scenarios for those of us who don't have the time and table space to play the whole thing.

Bad Points - This is a bloody expensive game! If you have a spare 260 euros laying around, there are worse things you can do with it than buy this. However, there are beat-up cars here in Derry that I can buy for a little more money!
Space Requirements. I know I just commented on the scenarios and, to be honest, that is this game's saving grace. However, I can ignore all the parts of the game that speak of the campaign since I don't come close to having the table space to set it up, much less play it. For some, it is the reason why they bought the game. For me, I'm paying for campaign scenarios that I know I will never be able to play and I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way.

Great package with so much in it. Production values are superb. Everything about it is beautiful. The game seems offputtingly complex at first Lance but once you get into the rules it is really quite straightforward and elegant. There are loads of scenarios which is great for learning the system and for those with reduced space.
I would recommend practicing the beach landings with the dedicated scenarios before attempting them in a campaign game, it will save a lot of grief.

It took awhile to decide to buy this but at £250.00 it was the craziest thing I have done. Yes there are a few issues with the rules in terms of it would be nice to have had a combined rule book with all of the updates. What has helped me get into this is the historical accuracy of the game, the VASSAL module which eliminates the remembering to do the math and Ty Snouffer and Lee Foresters You Tube video's. Thanks for all of your work guys and well done to Adam and Team for bringing this enormous project together. I actually love the beach landings as well!

RATING: 9.5
The chit–pull mechanic, with the possibility of a formation being activated twice in a turn, combined with command points makes for a tense and chaotic game. You always have to think where your opponent will be four chit–pull activations ahead of time. For example, you'll move your infantry squads to assault a heavily entrenched defensive line and you're hoping your naval artillery will activate before your infantry division, but it could all go awry. Down–time is very short and there's no part of the battle that's a chore (c.f. simulcast turns in the [b]Operational Combat Series[/b]) and isn't a blast to play.

A monster game with monster scenarios, as well as a plethora of smaller single map scenarios, and all at a monster price. I'm not sure I'll ever get into the [b]Grand Tactical Series[/b] system given its cost, but I'll happily play a friend's copy!

Playing my first-ever GTS scenario "To the Sea".  It's really fun and shows the differences between the armies.  It forces you to use combined arms and the narrative established as each tiny part of the battle resolves is great.

I should probably not be giving this a 10 as I have not yet played the whole campaign only a number of the shorter scenarios but I love the rules, the map and components are incredible and I can see myself playing this game right into my retirement, it puts you there like no other Normandy game I own, the GTA series like la Bataille is able to give you strategy and tactic in one package. It is certainly an investment in both time and money but the rewards just keep coming.

Bought only after much review of online reviews/aides, and the "encouragement" of MMP's Veteran's Day sale.  Very impressive components.  I have no hope of ever laying out the whole thing, but the scenarios are the saving grace.  They are plentiful and varied and interesting and I think will be satisfying enough.  It will be a big investment to really learn this thing, but as it is a "system," I eventually expect a decent ROI.  It may be a while before this really gets to the table, but it's definitely in the queue.

RATING: 7.5
Another fantastic entry in the GTS series. While the buy in price is steep, the game play volume more than makes up for it. A sound, sound purchase. 

In general, the 2.0 enhancements are welcome. I never thought of Assaults of much of a problem in 1.1, but sure, let's streamline it in 2.0. The way Independent units now attach to leaders is a fine addition. 

I think the game stumbles a bit with the exclusive rules in comparison to WED especially. In play, the 3-4 new lines in the CRT probably aren't worth the overhead. Same could be said of the new terrain features. More depth, perhaps, but more confusion at the same time. I think I was hoping for a game that played faster and smoother than 1.1

9 is an outstanding rating in my book and by far my favorite game system and comes highly recommended. 

[EDIT Jan 2017] Subpar game support has really taken the shine off this game. While the Designer and MMP seem to have some sort of pissing match over their relationship, owners are left with incomplete rules with little relief in sight. For such an expensive game, it is really a dis-service to fans and potential players. MMP needs to get this game and the series back on the rails.

I love the GTS series. My favourite gaming experience alongside ASL. Components are top notch and the maps are some of the very best in the business. Not a  cheap purchase, by any means, but worth every gaming penny IMHO. Scenarios range from the very small to 'I'll get around to it when I retire' size. Estimated playing times in the scenario book are, in my experience, very optimistic. Other than the very small , low unit density scenarios , allow a weekend or plan on multiple gaming sessions + for 2 players. The chit pull system makes it solo friendly and the GTS VASSAL module is probably the best VASSAL module out there as the combat wizard speeds play dramatically, just keep an eye on the mods as the wizard still requires manual input from time to time. I could quibble that the rulebook wasn't updated to version 2.0 on release, but that is minor issue. The more I get into the system the more subtleties are revealed. Recommended

. I can't believe that somebody has actually rated this game as 1 because he didn't sort his counters before playing??

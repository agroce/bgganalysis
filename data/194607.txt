Great deck building game. Easy to learn, easy to teach.  Love the clear layered cards adding onto your existing cards, it's not a new concept but they really nailed it here. Art is stunning. Feel of the theme doesn't come through very strong.

its pretty simple to understand the basic game mechanics but the playing and the meta gaming, is so much like an onion. My biggest issue is that it really plays best with 4 players. I would really like to see them expand to 5 or even 6. less than 4 and I feel you dont get enough game.

Adding both expansions to the game takes away a bit of the balance, but it isn't any less fun; not the biggest fan of deck builders in general, but this game is genuinely enjoyable; I have yet to introduce this game to someone who didn't like it

RATING: 5
The base game felt very...incomplete.  There wasn't much going on, and it felt like the best strategy is simply getting VP from one or two big cards.  Needless to say, I don't need to own it.

Played with first expansion, and some combos open up that are worth using, but it still takes luck to get the cards available for slotting and buying, and the combos must come out early enough in the game to be more valuable than simple VP cards.

RATING: 8
A great, novel game!  My only complaint is that growth symbols dominate EVERYTHING.  House rules help address this, though the power curve is still ridiculously on the geometric side (as in it just keeps getting steeper).

RATING: 8.5
Mystic Vale didn't catch my eye at first. It looked very abstract, too mechanical and the card crafting system seemed to me like another gimmick to put a spin on deck-building. When I got a chance to play it though, I was positively surprised. This game is not only very fun, but also kinda of addictive!

Maybe it's because Mystic Vale tickles my love of building things and personalizing my strategy, maybe it's its push-your-luck element that gives this game an extra dose of excitement... but I just loved it and I couldn't stop playing it. I like to create very powerful cards, make my deck efficient and try different combos. Maybe the card crafting system is a gimmick, but it's definitively a fun one.

I had however a few minor dislikes about Mystic Vale. The game was too straight-forward and I found myself wishing more complex mechanisms and combos. Fortunately this has been fixed by the two expansions that came our since, but without them the game feels very much like 7 Wonders before the Leaders and Cities: a good game but somehow incomplete! The first expansion, Vale of Magic, completed the game and considerably increased its variety. Vale of the Wild feels like the first real expansion and adds a bunch of new mechanisms and paths to victory that definitively opened the game up a lot more.

Therefore Mystic Vale is a game that I enjoy very much. It might be based on a gimmick to hide the fact that it's yet another deck building game, but it's really fun gimmick. It left me wanting more, but the expansions satisfied my wishes very well. This is a great game and one I want to play very often!

Rating without expansion: 7

Hits the table quite often. Consider getting at least Vale of the Wild, if not other expansions, as the card supply can get repetitive. Can feel like it ends a turn or two too early; consider upping the victory point supply by a few if you feel the game is ending right when the "engine" has been built.

In Mystic Vale, 2 to 4 players take on the role of druidic clans trying to cleanse the curse upon the land. Each turn, you play cards into your field to gain powerful advancements and useful vale cards. Use your power wisely, or decay will end your turn prematurely. Score the most victory points to win the game!

Mystic Vale uses the innovative "Card Crafting System", which lets you not only build your deck, but build the individual cards in your deck, customizing each card's abilities to exactly the strategy you want to follow.

Not a deck builder, but rather a deck changing game.  You begin the game with most of your cards being blank.  As you progress, you alter your cards.  It's an interesting mechanic.

RATING: 4
John Clair has had the clever idea of designing a deck builder in which you not only build your deck but assemble the cards in it.  Unfortunately the card components supplied are all rather bland.  Play becomes a fairly tedious matter of counting your money and buying what you can afford.  None of the cards that I saw in my one play did anything very interesting; there was certainly no prospect of the kinds of interaction you see in Dominion.   I think that Mystic Vale's card crafting will fascinate the purist deckbuilders, but there is so little here for anyone else.

I found the artwork quite pleasing, although the abundance of small font text was less so.  The cards and acetates seem well made.

Game had to end as a guest needed to leave suddenly, but before that I seemed to spend a lot of time clueless.  Worth trying again though to find out if I like it.
ETA: still spent a lot of time clueless, and some aspects seemed to just never be available for me, but I ended up winning, and overall it was nice to play.  I still need more plays to decide if I would like to play this more often or if it's not fun anymore once the learning curve is mastered.

About what you might expect from the first game to introduce card building, with acetate layering, in a deck-builder.  A nice push your luck aspect to it, and some nice card combos to play around with on your first few plays, but there is not much theme or interaction in the game, and plenty of player downtime.  

In the final analysis, if you like Dominion, definitely try Mystic Vale.  It just might be great for you.  I am just not presently eager to play deck builders with little theme and/or interaction so gotta give it a 5.

RATING: 6.9
An enjoyable deckbuilder with genuinely fresh-feeling and interesting mechanics. Instead of adding cards to your deck, you modify existing cards by buying transparent elements that slide into the card sleeve. This sounds awkward but the quality components make it all work effortlessly.

My main caveat is that this is even more multi-player solitaire than Dominion. There is almost no interaction and, like Ascension, the set of cards to buy are drawn randomly so players are usually not competing for the same cards. If you don't mind that, this is a nice addition to the genre.

Minor issues: Some cards of the same "level" are clearly better than others, which exacerbates luck of the draw from the buying deck. You need to note and keep track of interacting effects as you draw your hand; this feels fiddly and isn't helped by the small text on the card segments. Finally, a physical drawback of the card construction is that you can physically feel "fatter" cards during shuffling or glimpse them near the top of your draw pile, which can lead to guilty knowledge or facilitate cheating. The last is probably not an issue for most, but worth noting.

The art is generally quite good, but since each card is made up of 3 small pictures, each the size of a large coin, you don't appreciate them during play as you would art  on the full space of a card.

Already enjoying this one much more than I thought I would. Incredibly simple game but offers a neat blend of deck and engine building with push your luck. Card crafting system works much better than I anticipated and lets you customize your deck in really interesting ways. Only real complaint is that it seems like someone put some thought into the box insert but didn't consider how many decks of cards it needed to hold and created the wrong number of slots, making a good insert feel idiotic.

Played with a group of 3.  The card building thing is gimmicky, but works a little.  The main problem is as the game progressed just watching you opponent drop a card and say "because of this card, this negates this, and I get this..." over and over.  You're just waiting for their turn to end and yours to begin.  Fell flat and I traded it on.

This is a completely fresh take on the whole deck building concept.  Instead of buying cards to add to your deck you are buying cards to "craft" onto cards in your set deck.  Downside to this concept is that you are playing with plastic cards and I could see down the road possibly having to buy a new set if the print on the plastic cards wears off.  So far so good though.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

Could there be a more generic name and theme pasted onto the game? I'm more offended by it's use here because it's clearly a marketing move (fantasty sells) and I don't care for it.

The card building is interesting, although it does make the shuffling problematic (you can feel your best cards clearly). One would also wonder how durable the components really are. Time to break out the card sleeve sleeve.

It also did feel a bit to short, so there maybe not enough time to activate the cool cards you've built.

RATING: 5
Introduces a great mechanic of "card building" but in the end doesn't deliver for me. If combined with some other game play mechanics, the card building idea could be something really cool.

As it stands for me, it seems like there are too many turns you just kind of flop out your cards and see what you get. 

I'll play it if I know the game will be quick because it is fun to build the cards in your deck.

RATING: 6.5
I love the art, the theme and the name. Also the card sleeving/deck building mechanics are somewhat interesting and I just love how quickly your deck can explode into having crazy turns. However the random card market, the limited card (mechanics) variety/the replay value and the limited player interaction is what is holding me back from loving and playing this game a lot more. It just feels that there is not a lot of strong choices to be made and that strategic influence is minimal at best. I am hoping that future expansions will address some of these issues. Because contrary to these major points, I do really really really like the art and the theme and think it has the potential to be quite an awesome game. But as it stands the base set of this game for me is uninteresting after just a few plays...

I find this mix of deckbuilding (well, card building, yea yea) with a light push-your-luck element quite satisfying.  It is pretty easy to teach, and I love the fact that a designer looked at card sleeves and went "huh... I can make a game out of that."  And it is clean and compelling.  I will want some expansions soon so it doesn't grow stale, because the game's biggest weakness is its size: it just needs more cards and different mechanics.  Thankfully there are two expansions waiting for me to pick up!  I enjoy this one!

Really liked the concept of it being a "card builder" instead of a deck builder.  You're still looking for those power combinations, only this time you're not building out your deck and thus requiring so much culling.  Actually, there is an "inverse churn" in play as you create meaningful cards out of the blanks in your deck, but if you're being cautious with allocating curses then creating new cards isn't a bad thing.

Fun little game! We were intrigued by the card-crafting system and how it would work in actual play. Fairly well, as it turns out. There are very obvious strategies depending on which Advancement cards come out. The push your luck element is really fun and it can be mitigated to some degree. I lost our 3 player game miserably, 33-32-24 but can see playing this multiple times in the future. Also, should be better with the expansion cards mixed in for greater variety.

Card crafting... hmmmmm... it looks very interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the first "card-crafting" game I have seen. Rather than building your deck by adding new cards, you start and end with a 20 card deck, many of which are blank. You then use purchasing power from your cards to get transparent cards to add to your card's sleeves to beef them up and make them better when they come around again. The game also includes a push your luck mechanism in drawing your cards. You reveal cards until the revealed (but not yet played) card shows the third blight(i think that's what it's called... it's red) symbol, then you decide if you want to keep going, if you reveal a 4th, your hand busts and you lose that turn. 

I like the card crafting system quite a bit, although there really isn't much else going on in this game's implementation of it. I'm excited to see what else is done with the system, but it's still enjoyable enough in this game to make for a pretty good game, though i could see it being replaced if a better game that uses this system comes along.

Once you get past the gimmick, which is interesting but not overwhelming, merely a fine deck-builder.  More complex in its base iteration than, say, an individual game of Dominion, but it's not at all clear that that's a good thing.

The teardown annoyance is real, as well, and doesn't help get this to the table.

Two plays.  It is a very interesting way of doing a deck builder.  Deck doesn't get bigger, but the cards get better.

It's hard to read what is out on the table and in the two games, I wasn't hooked on any synergies, yet.  

It won't overtake Dominion, in my mind, but I will not have any issue of playing it because I think it's really neat.

The idea is interesting, but I feel like it needs a few more iterations to get it right.

Surprisingly well done. If you are one of the players who somewhat dislike being blasted with attack cards in Dominion, give this one a try.

It has very little if any player interaction, but with your card deck never growing or shrinking, rather improving the already existing cards, running a full on engine-optimization game is a *lot* of fun with this.

Next up we played Mystic Vale, a [-]deck building[/-] card crafting game about improving your deck and cleansing your vale. I really wanted to like this game, I feel that it takes a fairly novel idea of card crafting and brings it to a full game. The components are of high quality and the game fits well together. Unfortunately I found the game play lacking, its not so much that the game is boring... Its just that there really isn't any player interaction in the game and the victory conditions felt forced. I'm very interested to see what else they do with the card crafting system, as pointed out in the rule book. I remain optimistic for the system going forward. 

Update - 10/24/2016

I dislike this game less on my second play through.

RATING: 8
Wow, very pleasantly surprised by this. One of the first games in a while that I immediately wanted to play again after our first play. Ever since, this has come out pretty regularly (which is something remarkable considering our large collection). 

Although the plastic sleeves seem like a gimmick, the effect they have is a kind of built-in "culling" of your deck. Since your deck never changes size, you don't get burdened by your crappy starting cards like you do in other deckbuilding games. So the exciting sense of escalation and "engine building" common to all deckbuilding games happens much faster and more efficiently in Mystic Vale. This makes this game feel so satisfying, and seem so fresh in a genre that has already oversaturated the market. 

This is on its way to becoming my favorite deckbuilder. Let's hope the plastic cards hold up over time!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple deck building game.  Too simple.  After a few plays what few tactical concerns there are in the game (mana production, decay mitigation, victory point generation, and vale symbols) become obvious and so success is determined substantially by luck.

The mechanical gimmick (sleeved cards) is interesting but results in decks that are impossible to shuffle properly because of the varying card thicknesses.  One element of the game is brilliant though: the push mechanic.  You want to push whenever it makes sense to do so because it gets an additional decay card out of your deck which speeds it up.

I hate the random marketplace (like in Ascension) because it precludes strategic planning.  It is even more of a problem in Mystic Vale because even if something you want comes up on your turn, it might be for a slot that you do not have a vacancy for, or the card that the advancement combos with may not turn up.

All-in-all, Mystic Vale is a fine, but simple game.  I will play it if someone else wants to, but I won't suggest it and will not keep a copy in my collection.

Extreemly special deckbuilding game.
It is not about building your deck, but building your cards. So you never get the problem that your deck wil get too thick.
With experient gamers, you get a fast game, nice for a evening closure.
Artwork is beautifull, abilities are nicely presented, and the fact it is up to yourself, makes the game a must have.

Mystic Vale is quite a fun game, but it’s best (by a lot) with 2 players. The player interaction here is pretty minimal and each additional player just slows things down. It’s still OK with 3, but 4 is pushing it.

Still, I really like the new take on a deck builder, especially when combined with a mild push-your luck element. It’s not design genius, but it clicks nicely, has fun art, legitimate interesting choices, and is genuinely unique. Also super-playable. The theming is also pretty fun; it’s obviously trying to channel a more feminine-gendered style, which is fun and I like. It’s not obtrusive and works nicely.

One tip we had, it can help to make sure you’re playing on a light background, otherwise the cards can be hard to read if you have a Dark-surfaced table. Just grab a sheet of white poster board or something for the available overlays.

I haven’t played the 3rd expansion yet, but the 2nd one really makes the game better for hobbyists and I highly recommend that one. The 1st expanson is fine but is mainly adding variety (nothing wrong with that).

Interesting twist on the deck builder where players are actually building the cards in the deck.  There are some drawbacks to it (the permanent cards are not easy to acquire and almost useless), but shows some promise.

I was somewhat surprised by this game and the unique card crafting system. It worked pretty well and I did okay for my first play, and see where I could do better if I played again. The challenge is finding the right cards to combo together to get you the most out of each card when played. For me this game is just completely dry and lacking theme. You're primarily counting symbols to buy stronger cards on later turns and turn those into victory points. In a way it felt somewhat similar to Splendor in that regard and I'm interested to see where this game system goes but it needs a bit more for me to enjoy it.

RATING: 6.5
Much simpler than Dominion. Easier to play with the kids (11, 9, 7) because I don't have to shuffle their decks for them. I suppose I could sleeve Dominion for the same benefit. In a 4-player game, it is too easy to get excluded from the Fertile Soil advancements if you don't chase them actively, leaving you without the ability to play the rest of the game. It also isn't possible to control your deck very well as there are proportionally a lot more decays than there are ways to negate them, so building a true engine isn't possible. Your deck never grows in size, but it is also never under your control.

An excellent game from AEG.  It plays like a deckbuilder, except instead of adding cards to expand your deck with better cards you are upgrading the existing cards within the deck.  The tarot-sized cards are sectioned off into three areas (top, middle, bottom).  The upgrades you buy to the cards are clear overlays you slide into the "base cards" in your deck.
I highly recommend this game, we bought it at Gencon and played probably 15-20 games just at the convention.

Great fast, but not too quick, game that's easy to teach. Not a filler. Similar to Machi Koro in that you must build up your deck, collect points, buy more cards, etc to win the game before your opponent does. Very unique in that you're actually building your own cards as you go, each time you reshuffle your cards, your deck becomes more powerful. A friend showed me how to play this once, and after buying it, I was able to easily teach my wife how to play without the instructions. The box and instructions are very nicely done, well written, excellent artwork and color. I search for games that play well with only 2 players, and this one hits the mark. I doesn't look like it will become boring anytime soon. I would highly suggest this as a fun affordable game for 2-4 players that's easy to learn and teach others.

There's a bit of a learning curve here both in terms of the basic game flow but also what strategies are going to be effective. (It's like Dominion in that sense.) That being said, there's a lot of room to explore here, and the game length is just about right.

I have to give kudos to the designer for moving beyond the standard deck builder and finding a way to take Gloom's transparent cards and take it to the next level. The use of sleeves here is incredibly clever, and very easy for players to understand.

I'll need more plays of this to give a strong opinion on the game but it's definitely staying in our collection.

Components: Gorgeous artwork, though on tiny little squares of the advancements, so it's difficult to see, and as such doesn't add much to the theme. Vale cards look great.

This game's core mechanism interferes with its function. On my turn, I must count my decay, my mana, and my spirit icons. Although most of these symbols are on the sidebar of the card, they are in different locations on that bar, some are canceling others out, and some are instead on the text on the card or on vale cards. That makes counting difficult for the decay and the mana, but then especially for the spirit tokens, which not only come in four types, but are used in different combinations on vale cards, and there's no way to keep track except in my head of which ones I've used. By the end of the game my mind was exhausted trying to navigate the information.

Take-down is a pain, having to remove advancements from sleeves and sort them by their tiny level pips.

Experience: Card crafting is an interesting idea. I like the idea of trying to even out a card, to ensure that every card flip is beneficial. In theory I liked the restriction of having to find an open slot for an advancement, but in practice it mostly felt arbitrary. Other than a few times where I felt clever placing a growth advancement on a card with a decay symbol, it didn't really seem to matter how I constructed the cards (I wasn't trying to build a guardian-heavy card).

The on-deck card mitigates some luck by exposing what will be added to my field, yet the mechanism of having a face-up card that counts for decay but nothing else was a bit cumbersome.

Mechanically feels a lot like Dominion, much more so than other deck-building games I've played, but more fiddly.

The Card Crafting System is cool, and shows promise, but this game is terrible.  You play cards to get money to buy more cards, and that's it.  No real combos or interesting interactions like you would find in every other deck builder.  No chance to specialize or do anything interesting.  Plus, it's a pain in the ass to take apart at the end of the game.  Oh, and shuffling the plastic inserts isn't easy.  Oh!  The push-your-luck method of drawing cards at the end and start of your turns is convoluted and silly.  Disappointed with their first try, but would be interested in another CCS game.

Players who like competition without confrontation will love this game. Each player has a deck of cards consisting of a top, middle and bottom part. In each part a character or item can be placed which delivers mana (the money you use to buy new characters/items to build your own cards or to buy VP), 3 types of spirit powers which can be used to buy very beautifully designed cards representing specific places in the mystic vale (these can give you one-shot or perpetual extra actions, and possibly a bunch of VP), trees to stop the decay of the vale, and/or VP. Players start with 20 cards, some of which are completely empty, while others show mana (in order to get you going) or decay symbols. The latter symbols determine the hand you play with each round. You keep turning cards from your deck until 3 decay symbols are visible (2 in your hand, which in this game corresponds to "in the field", and 1 turned face up on your deck). At that moment you can decide to push your luck, place the card with the third decay symbol in your field and turn the next card of your deck face up. If a fourth decay symbol appears, your turn is all over, however, and all the cards in your field go to the discard pile without the possibility of using them. Bummer !! Decay symbols can be negated by means of tree symbols.

My favourite type of board games are in general tableau building card games and deckbuilders. I purchased this game due to the game receiving glowing reviews, despite my mild apprehension about the whole sleeving/unsleeving of cards, as it seemed like it had the potential to be very fiddly. However...

1) I don't feel the general feel of the gameplay distinguished itself sufficiently enough from Dominion. The game is exceedingly generic and themeless (just like Dominion), and is mechanically rather streamlined (probably just a little less streamlined compared to Dominion). And if that is the case, I would rather play Dominion over this any day of the week. The main distinguishing feature is the card crafting system, but....

2) The card crafting system is the one thing I hate the most about the game. The set up and tear down is a lot more tedious than in Dominion. The card thickness once you buy a few improvements is highly obvious. It is just as I feared, very fiddly. I don't mind a game being a little fiddly if the overall gameplay experience can transcend the fiddliness. Unfortunately it doesn't. The game is also a lot slower than a game of Dominion. When it comes around to your turn in Dominion, you generally know what cards you are going to play or buy. But due to the constantly changing cards in the market, it is a little harder to pre-plan your turn. 

3) There are just way too many other deckbuilders I would rather play, that feels vastly different from Dominion. I'd rather play Eminent Domain (deck building + role selection), Dale of Merchants (hand management, racing), Legendary Encounters: Aliens (cooperative, strong theming), just to name a few.

In summary, the general feel I get when playing this game feels to me too much like Dominion, and the one distinguishing factor it has I actually hate. I currently rate it a 5. I will probably try this game one more time as I really do want to like this game, but if it still falls flat for me after that I will sell it.

The mechanism is neat but physically weird to play with since the cards do get thicker as you have more plastic card inserts in the sleeves. Also the whole game felt like another deckbuilder race for points rather than something truly unique. Hope to see the mechanism in other more interesting designs that suit my tastes more.

Ok, the card crafting aspects of the game is interesting. That's about where the interesting aspects of this game stop. You're pushing your luck in hopes of not busting and then you buy stuff. Shuffle all the new cards back into your deck and do it again. Oh yeah, and there are some point cards you can collect if you get a set of symbols just because. The overlay inserts used to craft cards are also fairly easy to spot on the upcoming draw pile so you can't help but look to see what's next. Glad I played it but not something I'm going to miss.

It's a fun innovative idea for a deck building game, but there are a few issues with how its implemented that make for accidental mistakes and sometimes a lot of counting and downtime.

Really awesome idea with evolving the cards of the deck  instead of just adding more cards, too bad the game is so non-interactive that it's really multiplayer solitaire. There need to be cards that affect other players somehow or at least some sort of common pool you deal with. Sure you buy from the same stack of cards but as there are three copies of each card it doesn't affect play much.

I'd love to see more games using this mechanic (as the one in the back of the rulebook) as it's really cool, just need to evolve it a bit.

Love this game. The whole concept of building the cards makes the game different each time you play it. You don't directly attack other players but you are all buying new cards from a center pool, so there gets to be some attacking by taking cards you know the other player may be looking for. Push your luck with some strategy on how to build your cards provides for a very fun time each and every game. This game is a precursor to another Game coming from AEG that will also use the Card Crafting as part of the game. This was game was created to help introduce the concept of card crafting to the world... and it is a must have.

Only one play so far, so my rating is subject to change.  I liked the card crafting mechanic and the cleanup after the game wasn't nearly as bad as some of my other favorite games, so that concern was assuaged.  I also like the turn prep mechanic, that allows players to think ahead about their next turn and limits downtime.  The push your look element isn't my favorite thing, but it takes the edge off of a really bad draw.

All in all, it will depend on replays and how deep I feel the various strategies are as to whether this has good legs.

An interesting take on deck building, that does surprisingly little to distinguish itself. Although you are 'card crafting' the game doesn't feel wildly different from the typical deck builder, and manages to make things more clunky by needing to slide cards in and out of sleeves. However, it is fun to create combos between cards or within a card itself. I prefer several other deck builders to this, but I'd recommend people try it, if only for the novelty.

Mystic Vale is a very interesting and entertaining new take on deck builders. Instead of adding cards to your base deck, increasing the power level with more advanced cards, you spend your resources improving the cards already in your deck. The ability to customize cards allows for much more potent synergies and a greater feeling of accomplishment than your average deck builder. 

The lore of the game is well portrayed in the crafting of your deck, as you start in an empty barren land and work to transform it into a rich spiritual sanctuary. The art is wonderful and well implemented on the clear upgrade cards with a functional box insert to match. 

Not quite as much player interaction (read almost none) that I would like, however if you like multiplayer solitaire this game is definitely for you. 

The Card Crafting System is ripe with opportunity for expansions and new game mechanics which I patiently await the release of, while still offering plenty of replayability without any additional components.

It's Splendor meets Dominion, more or less. It's hard to keep track of all the various resources at times, which can make the game feel excessively fiddly in the later stages. The theme doesn't really work for me either. Why is this magic bird a source of "decay" but this magic wolf not? What do those helmets even mean? Some cards feel useless and never even get selected, as do some of the higher level "Vale" cards.

Since the deck size is so small I think that those with a knack for card counting might be able to really dominate play, but it's also a sort of "multiplayer solitaire" style of game anyway . There are four differently colored decks, one for each player, but beyond that they are all the same. This might become a much better game with an expansion or two, but as of right now I'm sort of regretting the purchase.

I find this game hard to evaluate because it'll probably end up like chewing gum for me, but my first impression is quite positive. I've enjoyed the handful of games I've played and look forward to more. How long that lasts remains to be seen. 

It's pretty well known that the innovation here is the transparencies that overlay cards, and there are some interesting decisions with those in how you craft new cards. But I also appreciate the push-your-luck way your "hand" of cards is built. Do you keep pulling cards into your hand and risk losing a turn or do you stop where you are even though you don't have as many coins as you need to buy that awesome transparency that you know won't be there next turn?

Like all pure deckbuilders, this one can get played so much that the cards feel stale and expansions will be required for more diversity, but ... that's not a problem in our hobby.

A friend has so I'm happy to play his copy on occasion but I found it quite entertaining, especially for someone who has zero interest in ever playing Dominion again.

Somehow both the most original game since Dominion while being a new take on Dominion. It plays like a deck builder, only you play with the same 20 card deck.

Game pace is a little slow in acceleration--it takes several turns for things to really get moving, but it's worth the wait.

Mechanics buy; I like the card-building, and it's been consistently popular (and fun!) every time I've brought it out.  Expansions are a must, as the base game's cards just don't have the variety needed for repeat play.

A nicely improved mechanic over Dominion (for deck building), by building the cards instead of the deck.  Other elements are the same, buying mana (money), VP, or metarules.

- I need more options and more depth.  Have to try the expansions.

RATING: 6
Really quite clever and novel idea, whereby you 'level up' your cards as you play, unfortunately the actual card abilities are just so very ......bland. 
There is SO little difference between each of the cards, it is simply a case of buy what you can afford and see if you luck into having the correct symbols (which are so few and far between) to actually take a vale card.

The push your luck aspect feels tacked on, why would you ever push your luck, and risk losing your turn? Gaining +1 resource simply is not sufficient compensation for the lost turn.

Its a nice game, the art is nice, the concept is nice, the game play is nice, its just nice. Uncomplicated and pretty, but pretty unsubstantial, and disappointing. I was expecting something more, something else from the card crafting mechanics, and it is simply not there.

I was so excited about the concept of building your own cards, different cards, in each game.  Every game would be new with numerous unique cards.  And the graphics are beautiful. 

The concept is so thoroughly engaging that I purchased the game before playing, but I found the game play not to be.  Felt like the same old get victory points, maybe push your luck, buy,.. repeat.  The card-counting player who tracks curses in their limited 20 card deck, has a huge advantage.  (Like, ha ha ha, how could you not know your last card was a curse!)

Sleeving my buys was no problem, but putting away was fiddly when all 20 cards had to be dismantled, and then sorted.  Also, an insert warns that cards will normally become scuffed.  

This elegant card-crafting mechanic will no doubt evolve.  Wish the game play here had been more interesting.

A deck-building game in which the deck remains at constant size but the cards it consists of evolve. Anything else I might say would probably be damning with faint praise. It works, but the available upgrades are a little on the unimaginative (and repetitive) side so the game already screams for an expansion or two after the first play - that's something I don't consider a plus. I'm also not a fan of the mechanism of "going bust" and losing your entire turn which is sort of the centerpiece here.

RATING: 5
Excessively fiddly. Not particularly interesting gameplay that fails to be masked by the "ooh, neat" factor.

At this point, mostly a mechanic in search of a game.

edit:

Ultimately, the whole must-peel-the-cards, combined with the ongoing hassle of putting cards in sleeves in mid-turn, then un-sleeving them at the end of the game puts a pretty strong onus on the game to be worth the trouble. Sadly, probably predictably, nothing has come close to meeting that burden. This gimmick is probably something that belongs in an electronic game, not a physical one.

I really like the idea of the card crafting system. Mystic Vale does a great job of introducing the system, and the system works extremely well.  However, the game  itself does have its faults. Lack of player interaction and theme bring the game down. There is not a lot of replayability because there are really not that many different advancements to choose from; beyond 3 or 4 games, players will tend to craft the same cards. There is an issue with runaway leaders.

The new card building mechanic is solely an gimmick.  It's a good gimmick but it doesn't change the feeling of the game: this game feels exactly like a deck-builder.  A fast, fun deck-builder, but still a deck-builder.  Nice art and quality card sleeve thingys.  Not enough cards though.  Played through this twice and saw all the level one cards and most of the level 2.  For this to have legs, and for me to be interested in buying it, they're going to need some expansions on offer.

A decent game. You "build" a card using up to 3 elements. The elements unfortunately don't vary all that much, though, and there is luck in the draws just as with any card game --it can be swingy when good cards come out on the display and time well with a player's draws. There's also a push your luck element to your hand, which gives perhaps a false sense that you have more control than you actually do. Interaction is super low, although the game timer of a VP pool can vary based on player's purchases. It's surprisingly fiddly for the quality of the components, as you are always sleeving cards and need to undo that after playing. Artwork is great. Good game for players who enjoy low confrontation puzzles. Plays relatively quickly, and most of your turn can be set up while others are playing --that aspect really shines in a 4p, as turns can go quite fast. While there is variety, it feels to me like it's played itself out fairly quickly.

I love the idea of card crafting and the push-your-luck aspect is very interesting, but the game is a bit unbalanced - VP generating cards are OP. The game also ends very unsatisfactory, suddenly the VP pool is gone and the game is over. The game ends too quickly to get your combos going and your deck improves so slowly that it's just not that fun until the very end. I like that it has push-your-luck, but it's far too harsh to lose your entire turn. There's also no player interaction.

My favorite deckbuiler. There is none I think are even close and I've played all the big ones. 

This feels like Splendor/Spice Road except you care more about what other people are doing and actually gets exciting when you do the push your luck action (and there are whole strategies that reward doing this action repeatedly, drastically changing the feel compared to other big combo or speed strategies)

edit: still really like this game. Especially more than dominion or clank. I would like to see how this plays with preset markets as that particular aspect of dominion is nice though. Would also like to try arctic scavengers again to compare since it's been a few years since I last played it.

The card drafting is very original and the images are really nice. To sleeve and unsleeve the cards every time is a bit boring. We left the deck ones permanently sleeved. The game is nice and it worked pretty well. We were able to arrive to buy all the levels of advancements and a lot of the vale cards of first and second level. The only problem is that it becomes a bit hard to maintain track of what you have in the field after some rounds. One needs a huge table to do so. We were able to correct the curse symbols with different advancements, but this means to have a lot of cards every time in your field with actions to do in the plant phase and in the harvest phase, money symbols, victory points and vale symbols to check, which was a bit chaotic. I think, after a bit, the expansions are necessary to change and enrich the gameplay. However we want to replay again.

RATING: 7
Mystic Vale is a fantastic little deck builder. Build up the value of cards and reveal as many as you can before "busting." In this, you try to generate enough money to purchase various upgrades/cards that will help grow a more powerful deck and ultimately score the most points. There is no thinning in Mystic Vale. The weaker, starter cards are upgraded throughout the game to become powerful and game changing. This is a great addition, because every card is potential to choose how your want to upgrade it. Add on to that the "bust" mechanism, and Mystic Vale is one of the best efficiency deck builders on the market. Also plays well at all player counts.

RATING: 7.3
Just flows better than Dominion or Ascension, with a more interesting puzzle to solve that is approached with less clutter than the multiple expansions of the other games. Did not hate the card building near as much as I thought I would (it was actually quite satisfying) and ultimately, if faced with a choice between this or dominion, I would pick this every time.

Crafting your cards is an interesting twist on the deck building genre, but the feeling is pretty much the same. It works, but maybe it would be better if the player decks were smaller, with fewer blank cards, because the limitation of placing an upgrade in its designated position is rarely relevant.

The card effects are quite straightforward and the decisions are simply about what upgrades to buy, or when to flip more cards hoping to get additional resources. This push-your-luck element (which may cause you to lose a turn) just feels out of place, although the variable hand size already carries a lot of randomness.

The artwork is beautiful, but it can only be truly appreciated on the special cards, as the pictures on the others had to be very small. I enjoyed my first play, but maybe the Fantasy theme helped, even if it is completely disconnected from the mechanics.

Played 3 times solo, watched Rahdo's run-through, thought the main mechanism would make it an instant love.
Didn't like the lack of a goal / story / something you build your deck for. The deck-building itself is good (but starts slow). The game says goodbye at the time you're barely done building your engine and can look up to see what's next either for further application of it, or for enhancements. Very frustrating for me. Need the 2 expansions to get "standard" combo's for a deck-builder to happen (esp. guardians), but it brings the number of cards up significantly without removing the base cards that become obsolete, thus increasing the luck factor.
Not for me.

So far, two different groups of people have loved this game outright. I have the same sentiment. I really love the card crafting in this game, and really want to see where AEG takes it in the future. 

The game is actually really easy to play and teach and is very fun. I think the game could use some more to it, to help flesh it out more. Even still, every game will be unique as you try different card combos and strategies. 

The game comes with good amount of upgrades, but an expansion will do this game well. Simply adding new upgrades will be great, but I would love to see how they can improve on the system. I feel Mystic Vale is the right step forward however, AEG definitely played it safe with this game. It's missing that "Big Oomf" that maybe a new game with the same system will deliver on. Still a solid game

I really like the "Gloom" style concept where you have transparencies laid over cards to affect their function, I also like the engine-building aspect of it and the tense push-your-luck part of your turn - it's a cheap but effective way to introduce some drama to proceedings and provide something of a narrative.

HOWEVER, the game appears somewhat broken (and I've only played it once, so the odds are we didn't find the only "break") since one of our players managed to construct a basically infinite combo and simply win on the spot. For people who have played this, he was able to draw his entire deck every turn with no risk of decay, then he could just buy whatever he wanted every time. This is fine in some games (MtG for example), but it felt rather weird here and left a sour taste.

Push-your-Luck Deckbuilder with a twist (craft). 
Theme is absimal, but the mechanics is solid. 
No player interaction.
Playtime is around 20 minutes with 2p, overstays its welcome with additional players.

Also possess: Vale of Magic, which brings more of the same, and adds variability to the game itself. Nothing stellar and I can't recommend it unless you got really tired of the base game combinations.

Fantastic illustrations, but sadly, it's just another mediocre iteration on the deck-building genre that favors chance over strategy. Push-your-luck combined with an economic snowball is bad design. Mystic Vale is a mechanism in search of a game. It hasn't found it yet, even after two expansions.

Shallow strategies, tenuous tension, incidental interaction, tediously tactile.

This gets around the major problem I have with deckbuilders, where generally you need certain cards to come out together in the same hand to combo off of each other, by letting you modify individual cards. So here you still get that effect combining feel but in a more controllable, reliable way by putting all of the effects which combo off of each other on the same card. But the problem is this engine is strapped onto an otherwise pretty bland game. Broadly speaking there are four things a card effect can do: directly generate points, give you currency to buy more card parts, have some effect which lets you get more cards out before busting, or finally give you a different currency which lets you buy the big point cards.

After I played this game I found out that it was designed to show off/get people ready for a bigger game which uses this card crafting mechanic, and honestly it shows a bit. The card crafting at the center of the game is for me the sole source of fun in the game and is probably enough for me to be excited to play this game a couple more times. But because the rest of the game is pretty bare bones this isn't a game I can really be too positive about.

RATING: 5.7
The "card building" concept is very novel and it's the main reason I bought this at all. I'm not normally a fan of light game like this but I was intrigued. 

While I appreciate the possibilities, I have to say that the base game without expansions is VERY bland.  Do not buy this game unless you think you'll also buy at least the first expansion which makes the game much better. Take that "much better" with a grain of salt though, this is still a pretty light game bordering on medium weight.

A major con are the card sleeves.  While they give some extras, it seems like one of the cards splits a seam each time this gets played.  If it's played enough you'll need to find more of these very odd shaped sleeves.  Hopefully they'll be  easy to find but they should have added extras into each expansion KNOWING this would be an issue.

I love the new deck construction mechanic, maybe this game will be eclipsed by another game that takes the mechanic and does a better job at a later date (I still prefer dominion to other deckbuilders), but right now I'm loving this game.

Later in the game, it can get very fiddly in figuring out how many green/red trees you have, and what vale symbols you have when deciding what combo of 2 vale cards to buy.

Again like other deckbuilders this is probably one that would have too much downtime as a 4player

As far as deck-builders go this is nothing special. You get resources and buy cards with said resources. What makes this game special is that the mechanisms in place make you feel that you really ''build'' your deck. I also like the push your luck aspect in this game. When I introduce people to the world of modern board games I always teach them ascension. This game is great as a follow up.

Deck-building except instead of adding cards to your deck you improve the cards already in your deck. Fascinating concept that seems to be done pretty well.  I always thought the Gloom mechanic was cool, but I wished it could be done in a game that didn't suck. Well, here it is.

Theme: Fantasy Druids
Gameplay: Wonderful "deck crafting" mechanic really freshens up the deck building genre, fun to push your luck with built-in consolation prize for pressing it too far, quick turns... only lacking player interaction.
Components: Outstanding - the arts is good but the sleeves & slotted plastic upgrade cards are next level.
Replayability: Played once, would play again. It screams for expansion support.
Rulebook: Never looked at it.

Ouch, I am not a fan. Sleeves-as-a-gimmick is annoying and cumbersome. The game is tolerable in its own right, and would probably score higher with me, if Dominion had never existed. But Dominion does exist, and this is a pale shadow of it (and I am not even a big fan of Dominion).

Dry and dull deckbuilder spin on Gloom card game mechanic of layering transparent cards. Once you get past the concept and presentation, you'll find that there's little actually going on under the hood. 

There isn't much in the way of special actions on the cards - just icons that let you purchase base cards, advanced cards, etc. You are just trying to collect icons and stack them in such a way that they cover negative symbols while amassing positive ones. 

Gameplay can be annoying as a strong card is just out of reach in mana cost, yet for one or two less cost there are marginal cards to be had which just layers up the muck. So there usually is a runaway leader problem as one person gets lucky when they push their luck to squeeze out that extra one or two mana to buy something really good.

The layering of cards can be tedious along with the math involved to figure out what your total mana is and if you're about to bust or not although the game does have players play ahead when it's not their turn to help speed up game play.

Too much solitaire going on for my tastes, a runaway leader issue where you get to wave "bye-bye", lack of meaningful card selection, little consequence of action against other players all lead to a dull experience that make this a ho hum deck builder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Seems like a generic deck builder with a gimmicky presentation. I guess creating a combo on a single card means you won't be stuck waiting for a combination that never happens, like sometimes happens in a deck builder. 

The push your luck mechanic of drawing extra cards and busting if you get too many decays is interesting, but in practice it seems to do what deck milling cards do in most deck builders. It also didn't seem to be much use until fairly late in the game, when everyone had cancelled some decays. 

The enhancements are, by necessity, about a third the size of a tarot-sized card. As a result, the enhancement effects were notably more difficult for me to read than a full card would be. I would not recommend this for people with poor eyesight.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

A while ago, I didn’t have much confidence in AEG´s games, but after Automobiles, and now Mystic Vale, my confidence in them has been growing steadily. I wanted to play Mystic Vale because the “Card Crafting System” sounds fascinating and it is :D. After playing Dice Forge, my interest in customized components increased a lot. After playing Mystic Vale, I can say I liked the game, but I have some misgivings.

The rules are pretty simple, you can explain them under 5 minutes. Playtime is very dependent on the number of players. I feel this is best played as a two player game, with more the downtime is too much for such a simple game.

The art of the game is gorgeous and the components are ok. I’m worried about the transparent cards, I cannot sleeve them and I feel they are going to suffer during repeated play. I wish there was a way to sleeve all the components, perhaps there is. I will buy a mat to play my copy of the game.

The first time I have seen transparent cards was in the Gloom series of games, but I heavily dislike Gloom in all its incarnations so I didn’t know what to expect here.

I, generally, love deckbuilder games IF they have a static market offering. Mystic Vale doesn’t have a static market offering, the cards appear at random and it bothers me, due to this, the strategy decreases a lot while tactics become very important. At least in Mystic vale there are 3 tiers of cards, all with a different range in cost and you can, at most, buy two cards per turn so the luck factor is restricted by a little bit, still, I would have preferred a more strategic game. Having said that, I enjoyed the game and I want to play it again, the crafting of the cards is very compelling and fun and this helps ameliorate the distaste that the variable market offering leaves at my mouth.

The game´s decisions aren’t very hard, Mystic vale has a light-medium weight. I LOVE that you always have the exact number of cards in your deck. In Mystic Vvale you don’t add more cards to your deck.

Besides the luck of the draw, there is also luck in your deck. When you end your turn you have to draw cards until there are 3 red symbols (decay? I´m not familiar with the terms yet) and you can risk losing your turn drawing more cards, that is, there is a push your luck element in the game. I’m still undecided how I feel about this.

As I have only played once, I cannot comment on the replayability. From my limited perspective, it seems high, but many friends have told me that the game comes with too few cards, the problem is solved though, I know AEG released at least 3 expansions.

When I was playing, the better cards were easily identifiable from my deck as they were a lot thicker than the other ones. I´m still undecided how I feel about this, but it can be used to cheat the “push your luck” mechanism and in other ways as well.

Bottom line, I wasn’t expecting anything good from Mystic Vale, but I really liked the game. It has a novel idea and the execution is very good. I’m bothered by the high luck factor the game has and I heavily dislike the variable market offering as it makes the game tactical instead of strategic, but still the game´s mechanisms won me over. I will probably buy the game along all its expansions and promos but I would like to play with my SO first to see what she thinks. Mystic vale is a cool deckbuilding game, but Dominion is still king for me. I wish there was an online implementation of the game, I would buy that right away. As it stands, Mystic Vale is a borderline 7.0 to me.

Although it is a bit gimmicky I would say that this game is a huge step in the right direction for deck builders. Having a deck that never changes in size really makes you decide how you can mitigate your worst cards and make powerhouses of cards. The quality of every card and the sleeves is top shelf. The artwork is amazing and the theme really shines through. Games, to me, are a bit short and I believe that an expansion that adds more depth will really send this game to the top of my list as it would presumably add more strategy to the game. The game plays fast and doesn't have much downtime. Overall a great medium deck builder with a fun, and new, mechanic and theme.

I'm somewhat at odds with this game.  It utilizes several conventions that usually hinder my ratings: multiplayer solitaire, lots of luck with who gets to buy what and when, and an end game that usually feels too prolonged.  and yet, I LOVE THIS GAME.  I just can't get enough of it.  I'm addicted to the card crafting and the push your luck draw mechanic.  I lose all the time because I wasn't lucky enough and I just don't care.  It is a marvelous game that embodies the spirit of fun in ways other games don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The hook of crafting cards is not really used in a compelling way. In fact I think they way it's been done adds more randomness to an already inherently random system. To make an optimal buy you need to have the advancement you want available to purchase, you also need it to be in the correct slot (top, middle, or bottom), and you need to have drawn the card you want to place it in. This is particularly true of the guardian icons.

The push your luck mechanism seems out of place in this type of game. It creates swingy hands and adds more luck to the game. It also creates a terrible rich-get-richer mechanism. If you manage to draw big early you can bootstrap your engine. One player gets a bit lucky early, the other a bit unlucky, and that's the game. Large point disparities between first and last are very common.

The art is very nice and sleeving transparent things is cool, but this falls well short of an interesting strategy game. It's a rather boring engine builder where your skills play second fiddle to the whims of chance. 

As a side note:
There are a few graphical issues as well. Cards that produce mana or points conditionally (usually based on guardian icons) do not show the mana or points icon on the left bar. This makes remembering those effects annoying, there should be an icon there with a ? inside or an *. The icons on the vale cards that provide resources to buy vale cards during the harvest phase are different than the purchase icons for some reason.

Nothing too unique here, and not the most elegant of theme either, but it does feel kind of cool to 'build' the cards (even though it really isn't any different than another deck builder). If the game came with the expansion by default (or was simply 2x the current size) and had a slightly better theme I could see myself rating it an 8. I love deckbuilders though, and I wouldn't place this in the top 10... so I would probably suggest other games instead.

I love the card crafting, it is a really awesome system with lots of legs. While I usually dislike push-your-luck in games, I like it here, because you always know the odds, and even busting has benefits (getting one spoil card out of your next hand, and refreshing that mana token), and because of the deck-building nature, the cost vs reward is easy (and interesting) to calculate ("With 4 I can buy this, but getting to 6 would be much greater").

However, my main problem with the game (which I still like, don't get me wrong) is that the actions you get to do are pretty boring. You get resources to spend, free discards, anti-spoils. The Guardians can get interesting and open room for strategy, but compare that with the non-plus cards from Dominion, and you'll yawn.

RATING: 4
Original thought while playing is that it has a unique mechanic, gameplay flows well, press-your-luck mechanic is nice, multiple paths to victory.  After playing though I realized it was completely multiplayer solitaire.  Others actions and purchases did not affect my play at all.  There did seem to be a dominant strategy (cancelling red trees) and the person who gets that going first has huge leg up on others.  It was an okay 45 minutes of play but really not interested in playing it again.

When people tell me they enjoy Mystic Vale, I feel like they belong to a different hobby from mine. It combines everything I hate: interminable shuffling, inconsequential card drafting, tiny incremental choices that add up to a win when someone's hand cascades, it's fantasy themed (why do I care about any of this?), and it's short. Well designed, but the opposite of what I like.

Oh God! You just look at the back of the box and have to buy this immediately! The thing about deck building games is that they're so moreish! They're over so quickly after you've finally put together what you wanted that you don't get to use some of the things you wanted to use. Then you've gotta play again. This game builds on deck building in such a unique way. Wow, we just loved building the cards! Some of the options were just brilliant. You wanna have it all! Of course you can't, so you just reshuffle, prep and wait while others take the awesome things you were gonna get next. Then you see what else is available and you want that too! This will be picked up on, I hope, by other designers and used in heaps of different themes and with other mechanics too. so much fun :)
Another pro is that it's fast, not difficult to explain and has the nice 'push your luck' feature. Theme is not pertinent, so if that's your go-to for a game, this doesn't work.  Whether a pro or a con is up to individuals, but the card items are just a distraction and really players need to look at the vale items to buy which get the points at the end of the game.
Drawbacks are minor; playing it enough will see you get through all the decks over and over. Deck building needs more variety in the card choices. I assume there'll be an expansion at some point. Also, the sleeves will wear out. AEG provided nice heavy-duty ones with the game. But this game will come off my shelf again and again and the card size is huge so sleeves are a pain to get and expensive. Not sure the huge card size is necessary. The small inserts need artwork and symbols on them, (and words which are too small despite the large size) leading to the large size of the cards, but is it necessary?

Enjoyable and different enough to other games to be novel. Could use some player interaction, but thats not essential for now. Hoping the expansion will add it.

Well the 1st expansion really hasn't added any interaction. Card combo chances have increased but this remains multiplayer solitaire. As such 11 plays have left me close to  the point where I have seen everything from the game it is capable of offering at this point.

Jó ötlet, hogy az átlátszó kártyákat valami komolyabb játékba is alkalmazzák, és biztos vagyok benne, hogy komoly fejlődés várható e téren. A Mystic Vale valamilyen szinten ennek a fejlődésnek valamiféle első lépcsőfoka, ami minden bizonnyal kiforrja majd magát. Nem rossz a jelenlegi formátumában sem, de technikailag még nem igazán szép, vagyis nekem nem tetszik egy három fóliás lap összerakva. Ettől még funkcionális, azzal nincs gond. Az alapötlet mindenesetre tetszik, és mivel szeretem a deck-buildingeket, ezt is élveztem. Játékmechanikailag jobban, mint látványilag.

Fun, unique new style of game. I tend to think those calling it a deck builder are mistaken, as you always have 20 cards in your deck. It uses what the publisher has dubbed the Card Crafting System, and it truly is different from deck builders. Very fun. Many will be turned off by the lack of direct player interaction and the light theme. Neither seems to bother me, though I do wish the theme was more prevalent. Regardless though, enjoyable game that I will play many more times.

Game's a bit too short to really get your engine humming, but it's still fun. You'd think the most innovative mechanism would be the card-creating, but that's not what ends up setting it apart from most deckbuilders. In fact, it's the push-your-luck mechanic of "spoiling" and basically losing your turn. Luckily, there's a decent consolation for busting, though not good enough that you'd wanna do it more than a couple times a game. Could do with some expansions, otherwise the replayability is moderate at best.

Played this twice at a games evening and quite enjoyed it.  I preferred this style of deck building over the constant shuffling of Dominion.  In the first game I concentrated on acquiring the coins ("mana", I think) and bought a couple of VP scoring cards towards the end, in the 2nd game I tried to buy VP cards from early on.  The latter completely stalled as once the "cheap" cards went I struggled every turn to buy anything.  Fun - but not sure if there is enough there to want to purchase it for lots and lots of plays.  Perhaps if a big box came out

My first deck builder!

I loved the mechanic of improving my draw as the game progresses.

Mystic Vale had several card enhancements that were hard to use. For example, the one that reduces its card to only one Red dot, requires the card to be full and the other two spots to have red. This might be impossible to get in a given game. The Owl, the enhancement that removes an entire card is much easier to setup and is more useful right away.

The Helmet cards are also hard to setup.

People that have played other deck-builders say this game does not have enough cards. I'm not sure that is true for new gamers to deck-builders (AKA: it is its own game and shouldn't be held to expectations one picked up from other games).

RATING: 9
As a person who has always loved card games, this is one I ordered as soon as I read the description of the game and seeing the card crafting system. It is just as amazing and fun as it sounds. I do hope that they release more cards for this in future expansions!

The only thing I wanna put as a negative is that why couldn't they have added a few more sleeves! This is not standard sleeves you can buy in any game store. You can probably get them by ordering online, but at least send enough sleeves for all of the cards. As it is now there is enough for all the player deck cards that are the base for the crafting, and then 20 extra that they write in the rule book are meant for when sleeves get worn out after many play sessions. Why not just add a few more to sleeve the Vale cards aswell, and the player references. It might be minor, but as someone who likes to sleeve and pimp all of my games, this bothers me.

RATING: 6
12-12-2017 - Man I want to like this game.  And I do, but the sleeves the game came with split on me and I haven't bothered to buy new ones.  So it sits on the shelf without my caring enough to fix it.  Very neat though how you build your cards out.  6

RATING: 6.5
Beautiful content, palpable plaisir at the components, and interesting crafting mechanic. Interesting push-the-luck mechanic, too.

Flaw 1: very limited player interaction (e.g., no attacks like those seen in Dominion). Interaction limited to buying cards the opponent may like first, and to altering the tempo of the game (e.g., rushing if opponent goes for slow strategy)

Flaw 2: combos are less deep than those in Dominion.

Really enjoyed this deck builder. I like the fact that the number of cards doesn't change, so it's effectively a card optimizing game instead of a deck optimizing game. Pretty cool twist on the traditional deck builder. The whole sleeve component is a bit awkward, but works.

In Mystic Vale, 2 to 4 players take on the role of druidic clans trying to cleanse the curse upon the land. Each turn, you play cards into your field to gain powerful advancements and useful vale cards. Use your power wisely, or decay will end your turn prematurely. Score the most victory points to win the game!

Mystic Vale uses the innovative "Card Crafting System", which lets you not only build your deck, but build the individual cards in your deck, customizing each card's abilities to exactly the strategy you want to follow.

2-4 players. After a video review, the card crafting mechanism is awesome But the game itself is very abstract.

It feels the same situation that Dominion was in. It's a new mechanics in search of a game. I suspect that as time passes, other games will use the same mechanism and eventually comes up with a game I like. 

That is what happened for me with deck building and I suspect it will happen again with card crafting.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first set of plays. One certainly has to watch the tempo of the game and plan accordingly. The combos that can be constructed on a card is really quite interesting. Can be frustrating when the cards you want come up on an opponent's turn and they purchase the cards but those are the breaks.

The idea behind this game, using sleeves and clear cards to create cards for a sort of deckbuilding game, is interesting and novel. The game itself, a little less so. It's the usual generic lite fantasy whatevers. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not particularly captivating and I think it probably gets old pretty quickly.

Certainly innovative in its mechanics, Mystic Vale demonstrates that you need more than innovations.  You need an actual game.  This is largely lacking, but the general experience of playing makes up for it.  I imagine that the incentive to play this will drop significantly once someone makes an actual game to properly embrace the frankly stunning innovation that Mystic Vale premiered.

Crafting card is great but the "strategic push your luck" is why the game is really good. 4 strategists axes (Big mana, VP makers, Vale buyer, Decay Killer) will give you plenty of victory path.

The game is pretty simple to learn and play but probably not for a true beginner to card/deckbuilding games. The cardcrafting system is great and a very innovative feature. I love it. Sometimes the games feel too short, though. Want to give this a 9. Subtracted 1 point for the theme being kind of soft and 1 point for the base game being kind of light on content. It seems like the content from at least the first expansion should have been included in the core set. I have not purchased it yet but from what I can tell I should get it before I put any more time into playing the game.

As this game does not rate high, this one is right my ally. The mechanic of this game is a little different from the other card builder games. You can build a single combo card but there is no guarantee that it will be pulled off again. Also there are more than one strategy you can use to win. Not only that, but the artwork is absolutely beautiful. Which helped my wife to start playing the game, this one turned out to be one of her favorites.

Generic, generic, generic.  I'm normally a big fan of deckbuilders, but there is not a single interesting decision to make in Mystic Vale.  A tad bit fiddly to play and clean up so I'd gladly never play this one again.  

Want a game with minor push your luck?  Check out Port Royal instead.  Not a deckbuilder, but a tableau builder.  

Want a deckbuilding game?  Check out almost anything else - Dominion, Tyrants of the Underdark, Clank, Star Realms.  Some of these aren't even my favorite, but they are much more enjoyable than Mystic Vale.

RATING: 6
Very clever card building game with Hand management. You start with basic cards in your deck and them throughout a few turns you purchase upgrades for those same cards and begin to score points. The cards are clear and the upgrades slide on top of the existing card showing the original card plus the new abilities added. Cool stuff.

RATING: 5
Innovative, fun deck builder that is ruined by bad game balance. A few point granting cards are the best strategy - they give far more points than anything else and bring the game to a close quickly, making any other strategy the wrong one. 

This can probably house ruled fairly easily by removing some of those cards or requiring more point tokens to be taken for the game to end, but I can only rate the game as designed. Would probably be a 7 if this was fixed.

RATING: 7
It's a deck building game. And it's also a card building game. It is definitely a [i]very[/i] different... thing. I personally believe that the player decks are bigger than they should be, with too many blank cards, many of which never get even one advancement, and also that a few tweaks would probably make the game flow with a better overall pace. That being said, I think it is already a really good game as it is. Pulling off a card that combos with itself for insane amounts of VP and actually being able to play it feels really rewarding. Worth checking out if you enjoy deck building games and are looking for something different from everything else.

Love the system, hate the game.

An interesting new twist on deck-building, or how we can call it in this case, card-building. The idea is fresh and really fun. I would like to have more than 3 slots. 4 would let the player more flexibility. The power looks a little samey after a while and the Vale cards are not different enough for my taste. I guess expansion will fix this issue. Overall, good game!

RATING: 8
The novelty of "card building" feels fresh. 
The main mechanics of the cards are typical of deck building games.
The push your luck mechanism is really nice. The game is made in a way that lets you abuse combos based on this mechanism. This is what feels really different from typical deck building.

The bad is the downtime between turns and the "solo" feeling, but these two are in no way worse than Dominion.

The biggest design problem is that the text on the cards is very small. Unfortunately I don't see how this can be improved.

All in all, if you like deck building, you should give this game a try.

Two plays and I'm just not excited about this game. There is enough there, it isn't a bad or poorly balanced game, it just feels like the decision making is only surface deep and the ability to make cool self-comboing cards is severely limited. 

I think they are really onto something with the cardcrafting system, but I'll wait for something better to come out of it than this game.

I've only played once, so take this with a grain of salt, but I really didn't like a few parts to this game.

Card crafting is a super-cool element, and I'm excited to see it used in more games, but this play seemed to have a big problem with runaway leader (it was obvious who would win the game about half-way in, and it just got worse as it went along).

I also don't like the method of spoiling your field to see what your hand will be.

It just didn't sit well with me, and I understand why some people will love this game, but I'm unlikely to want to play this one again.

This is a card crafting game, which is a little similar to a deckbuilder, only you will always have a deck of 20 cards. In the beginning a lot of them are blank, some have a basic income, and some have a basic income and a decay.

On your turn you turn over one card after another until you have a set number of decay symbols in your field and one on top of your deck. You can then choose to push your luck by putting the card on top of your deck into your field and turning over the next card. If you get too many decay symbols you spoil, and you don't get to do anything this turn.

If you don't spoil, you have the option to buy vale cards (which are cards that are always out in play, never in your deck, and earn you points and/or give you abilities) and card upgrades. Upgrades are translucent plastic cards where either the top, middle or bottom are covered with a "land". Any upgrades you buy has to be put onto one of your existing cards (into the sturdy sleeve on each of your cards) and cannot cover any land that is already on the card.

This is a really fun game with a ton of possibilities. You can choose to spread the upgrades onto many different cards of build up a couple of super cards, both equally valid. I can't wait to try this out with the expansions.

RATING: 6
A great twist on the "deck builder" genre, this changes the focus to card building. Instead of thinning out your deck to create your engine, you always have a deck of 20 and have to tune your cards with acetate inserts to get it flowing faster. With a Push mechanic similar to Dead Man's Draw, it's mechanics come together and it's a joy to play. The only caveat is you need sleeves (provided) to play, but in this game where you keep putting and pulling stuff in the sleeves, you can be sure the sleeves will break sooner rather than later. It's a pain getting the right size sleeves for this.

I was burnt out on deck builders for a bit but then Mystic Vale came along. Its kind of a deck builder but it's really not. Its a card builder game. As in the number of cards in you deck is set but you buy from the pool to change and make better cards. It's quite genius actually it changes the game so much certain deck qualities like deck speed and culling cards need a whole different approach now. The game is the right amount of play time, it's easy to teach, and the components are very good quality. They even decided to use tarot sized cards. So the cards are nice and big and if you ever need new sleeves you do not need to special order. Initially this game didn't have much replayability but with two expansions already out that idea is dead and gone. Now this game is just great. 

Stored in bitbox medium. Original box stored in Box #2 at Dad's.

Delightful artwork, very unique and fun card crafting mechanics, easy to teach - these are all good and I've seen it go over well with a variety of people.

Original deck builder where you create your own cards - the base game lacks a little bit of meat so I bought the expansion to give more variety. Major complaint for now is that you don't mind what the other people are doing during their turn making the game play feel very solitary. Also the vale cards weren't bought as much as expected in the games we've played. I like the general idea though.

Im Kern ist Mystic Vale ein Deckbuilder mit einigen Änhlichkeiten zu Ascension. Einzigartig ist aber der komplett neue "CardCrafting"-Mechanismus und ich persönlich finde ihn mehr als genial. Man startet das Spiel mit 20 Karten in seinem Deck und tatsächlich werden aus auch das gesamte Spiel über nicht mehr. Stattdessen kann man seine bestehenden Karten "aufwerten". Dafür kauft man zusätzliche "Kartenteile" aus der zentralen Auslage und "schiebt" diese in die Hülle der Standardkarte. Dadurch "baut" man immer mächtigere Karten, mit immer stärkeren Effekten. Der Einstieg in Mystic Vale ist wirklich unkompliziert und die Karten(bauteile) sind verständlich. Mystic Vale macht eine Menge Spaß, was mir bisher noch etwas fehlt, ist die Interaktion unter den Spielern. Für zukünftige Erweiterungen wünsche ich mir Möglichkeiten, den Gegner anzugreifen und zu nerven. Wenn dieses Element noch hinzu kommt und gut ausbalanciert ist, kann Mystic Vale eventuell noch einen Wertungspunkt hinzu bekommen.

It is also easy to tell when they are going to come up (they are fatter cause multiple cards are in a sleeve) which you can't really stop happening.

Rather play a game with more interaction

I like this game.  The "card crafting" mechanic is neat and innovative.  Yet, I don't feel the need to own it.  Yet, it charmed me enough to get it :)

Well, just played a 2 player game with my 17 year old son in 1 hour flat.  Easy to teach, easy to play, pleasant and fun.  He won, but really I won.  Anytime I get to spend with him is a Win for me :)

Got a chance to play with both expansions.  Excellent, bumping rating up.

The shine on this one is starting to wear off as I play it more. Even with the expansion, I feel like this doesn't have the replay value that I thought it would initially. Maybe future games that utilize this idea will be better, but honestly, I prefer Flip City at this point.

A fresh take on deck building that doesn't deserve the opprobium heaped upon it, and those comparisons to Dominion are total nonsense.  The choices are wide and nuanced, and the building of individual cards presents many tricky choices in terms of power and balance.  It is multiplayer solitaire in the sense of not being able to interfere with your opponent, but canny players will always adapt to what other are doing and seek out a more viable route to victory.  Fresh and accomplished.

Easy to learn and relatively short game. The artwork is breath-taking. It was incredibly fun, with a unique card creating mechanic for cool combos. However, it left us wondering, what now? Once the cards were created, we wanted to do something with them, but that was the end of the game.

The game feels like it's missing something. When you get to late game it really feels like a bit of a chore to book keep all the icons that you get that turn, feels less streamlined that something like Dominion, but it is definitely different.

Looking forward to the game where this mechanic is fleshed out more. The game isn't quick enough for a filler, scoring and take down is probably faster than one of your turns near the end. Otherwise it is a unique experience playing the game.

The swingy interaction is a bit concerning and this comes from someone who enjoys the swingy nature of Ascension.  Not a very strategic game but it is nice that it gives you someone "cool" to do.  The expansion does not affect gameplay much but to me was necessary to "water down" static choices.

To its credit, it plays very fast.  This is definitely a plus.

Each player starts with a card deck of 20 cards. Each card has room for 3 slots. During the game you will acquire other cards, which are on transparent cards to fit into one of the three slots. 

During your turn, you can try to push your luck to get more mana, but if you draw another cursed land, you lose your turn.  It has some nice deck building features and you can try various strategies.  

It's fun and has some interesting ideas. Depending on the cards, you have to adapt your strategy to what cards are out there, and perhaps take risks. It's similar to many deck building games out there, but also fresh at the same time.

Could do with more plays, unsure how to rate this. Immediately didn't like that it was mostly solitaire if not entirely. Many cards are drawn and you just calaculate and buy, often taking a long turn. Especially  if you can draw more or all of your deck, as collecting more green trees to cancel red trees appears to be a dominant strategy.

As fast as this flew off the shelves at Gen Con, it feels like I must have missed something important.  I love deck-builders.  I am SO intrigued by this mechanic.

I will happily investigate any future games with the mechanic, but don't plan to revisit this one.

心得:
很像是把台灣那個flip city遊戲概念加進去的遊戲
除了翻牌賭牌運爆炸跟牌套構築外
能力上算是中規中矩
主要還是塞卡套事實上也點煩
卡牌能力也應該要圖示增加遊戲速度
不然快節奏的遊戲還要看文字來決定要買什麼有點慢
還OK玩的遊戲
規則:
*中央先把沃土強化卡分類放旁邊，然後每個等級的強化牌分類洗勻，等級1照人數2/3/4人拿12/15/18張蓋著開三張放中央，其他等級全用分類好蓋著一樣開3張，中央總共9張可買，山谷卡照牌背分類洗勻，各開四張，分數2/3/4人拿23/28/33分，其餘一旁備用，拿同等玩家數魔力圓片(其中一個要有起始標記)，蓋著發決定起始，然後全部翻到使用面
*每個人拿一組20張裝好牌套的種族牌洗勻成牌庫，牌庫第一張牌永遠打開，不斷放置到前面直到前面跟牌庫第一張總和加起來有三個詛咒地標記
*遊戲輪流進行直到分數拿完且每個玩家有一樣回合結束，每個玩家會有四個階段
1.種植階段 選擇跳過或把頂牌放到前面再開一張，可重複直到有四個詛咒地標記或是跳過，如果有四個詛咒地標記跳到棄牌階段，當牌不夠抽將棄牌洗勻再抽
*持續效果牌在牌庫頂就有效果，其他都要打到前面開始哪個階段有效果，買卡也都只能使用打到前面的資源買
*一個綠地標記可以取消一個詛咒地標記，標記都在牌的最左側列
*如果四個詛咒地標記導致爆掉，則魔力標記翻面，下回合可用，已經翻面就沒有補償
2.收穫階段 任意順序執行卡牌的收穫效果(每張一次)，拿分數(左邊亮的)，然後計算魔力跟符號可最多買兩張加強卡跟兩張山谷卡，山谷卡拿到橫置不能使用，之後每回合可橫置使用一次
*紫色漩渦符號在自己的卡上是百搭，每個符號只能花一次，山谷山的彩色漩渦代表什麼都可以用
*加強卡(中央9張跟沃土卡)跟山谷卡右下分數標記為遊戲最後計分用
*買加強卡花左邊魔力(魔力標記可翻面當1魔力使用)，買山谷卡花符號
*加強卡如果不能放到目前場上的卡片牌套且不遮到其他部位則不能買
3.棄牌階段 所有加強卡放到場上的卡片牌套內且不能覆蓋掉其他加強卡(長條文字可以蓋掉)，之後所有場上牌移到棄牌堆，場上空的山谷跟加強卡空位補牌，該等級不夠補就拿高一等級的補，下一個玩家可以開始行動
4.準備階段 一直將頂牌放到面前在開下一張，直到看到三個詛咒地標記，同時結算出牌的效果(如果因為你有牌有兩個導致爆掉，則下回合就直接進入棄牌階段)
*遊戲最後結算所有拿到的分數根卡牌右下角灰色分數，最高分獲勝，平手比2~3級加強卡數目
*每次放卡片建議放到就的右邊，所有符號都不會被遮到，可啟動的文字效果就要自己注意
*四張詛咒地只有在準備跟種植階段會導致爆掉，其他時候不會

I thought a deck-builder about druids would be awesome and was expecting exciting stuff like dandelion witches and wolf shamans as with Ascension but instead was treated to underwhelming things like fields and sleepy owls.

I'm convinced that with expansions, Mystic Vale will be revered as game masterpiece, with  it's plastic cards,  wonderful art, and excellent graphic design.

Cool and Addicting. Take Splendor-on-steroids, throw in deck-building-on-steroids, add a pinch of push-your-luck, put it to a fantasy nature theme, and you've got Mystic Vale. Gameplay is thoughtful, yet relaxing, and takes less than an hour.

The deck-building part of this game isn't too much different than many others out there, but with the addition of slipping Advancement cards into sleeves with other cards which allow up to 3 slots/powers/money the game takes on something new. Instead of a set number of cards every turn, players keep flipping until they have 3 red tree symbols showing. They can try to push their luck and flip over more cards, but if they get a 4th red tree, they can't buy any cards that turn. Also there are Vale cards which can be acquired using symbols on your cards (usually higher Advancements have more of these symbols.

I like the mechanic of adding effects to your cards, that way your deck always remains at 20 cards and there is no need to worry about a heavy deck or cleanup. But you have other issues as in you can never remove a card modification. The base game is decent but seems to be missing something, which I am sure will come with an expansion, As it stands I don't think I would recommend it as there is limited things to do and it gets a little repetitive due to the lack of variety and obviously they are planning to sell you more.

Mystic Vale is kind of like a deck-building game, except instead of adding and removing cards from your deck, you add clear plastic inserts with card text printed on them into card sleeves to improve the cards in your deck. The game also uses a push-your-luck element for drawing cards--you can draw as much as you want, but if your draw 4 curse symbols you bust and lose your turn. I enjoyed both of these aspects of the game, and generally thought the whole thing was pretty clever. However, the game seems to end before longer-term strategies that look like they should work have a chance to execute.

It's basicly a deckbuilding game (a genre I like), but the number of cards in your deck stays on 20, it are your cards who are getting better. the crafting idea I like, but the push/spoil - mechanism ain't my thing.

Edit 22/03/2017: What bothers me the most is that some cards are better then others and that it's totally random who will be the first one able to buy those better cards. Therefore I will never chose this deckbuilder from those among my collection and I've sold it.

I think its natural to compare this game with Dominion and I like Dominion better. The feeling of "crafting cards" is fun, but you only have few options to choose from (unlike Dominion where you have all the cards set up from the beginning).  Still the game is solid and gambling for another card is always fun.

Such a cool mechanic! Can't say I loved the game though. Happy to play it and will likely own it. I played a hellava lot more Dominion base than I care to play Mystic Vale base. After first play I felt the game was unfinished. It needed more to grip me wanting to play more. Yes, there are expansions and I plan to try each one! I can't say I am a fan of a game that should have just planned for a bigger base game to make it "complete" vs putting out a game with the first expansion in the works already. It doesn't sit well with me. 

Alas, the game is beautiful and interesting and I look forward to seeing where it leads.

Unique "card crafting" engine builder where card sleeves are filled with purchasable, stackable transparent cards. Really like the forest theme and artwork.

This game pioneers a new mechanic called card crafting, which allows players to create their own cards using clear cards and sleeves.

I'm not a fan of deck-builders in general, but Mystic Vale was a pleasant surprise.  The key here is that the size of your deck never changes, and so the statistical warping associated with shuffling bloated decks is gone.   
I still feel like there's way too much  luck involved in drawing well, but that's a sin of deck-builders as a whole.   This stands out as one of the better ones.

First few times I played this, I loved it. New take on "deck building" mechanic (called card crafting in this one I guess). I'm finding, however, that the more I play this game, the less interested in it I become. The vale cards are distractions and if you make the mistake trying to focus on them, others can easily run away with the game. I find that the game always seems to end just when I've built up my cards into interesting combinations and this that is always frustrating, whether I win or lose!

I wish there was more player interaction. It's like each player is just playing by themselves to race to win. This games reminds me of Dice City, but better.

This one has really grown on me, especially with the expansions. Plus my wife really likes it. The theme is still weak, but the expansions really add a lot to the experience. With Vale of the Wild, and soon to add Mana Storm and Conclave, this goes from a 7 to an 8 for me. Conclave could take this one even higher. Overall it is a unique deckbuilding experience with an added push your luck 
element, with a Race for the Galaxy end game. All of those items together give this one a step up over the regular deckbuilder sometimes.**Wife:9

I really like the idea of crafting the cards individually.  The artwork is also top notch.  I've played several times and have enjoyed the game each time.

That being said, I have two big concerns about this game.  First, the sleeves that are required to play the game tend to break a decent amount.  They nicely provide 20 or so more than required when you buy the game, but at the rate myself and group are destroying them, I'll need more sleeves soon.  I don't think the sleeves are poorly made, but by constantly putting cards in and out of the sleeves (this is due to gameplay) and shuffling (we've started doing pile shuffling technique to try and reduce wear) they will fail often.  

Second, I'm thinking this game will get "samey" without an expansion or two in the future.  You use every level two and three card each time you play, with only the level ones varying.  My concern is that there may not be enough variety from game to game - or perhaps I've just been spoiled by Dominion.

It's a deck-building game but with something really new and interesting. You deck always have the same 20 cards, but you start modifying these cards crafting each one with improvements as you play.

There are several strategies to play with this game, some work best with a 2 player game, and others best with 3 or more.

The idea is really interesting, but maybe it could be better. I say this because this game is essentially a solo game played as a multiplayer game. The only interaction between players is who buys which card before others do.

Despite of this, I enjoyed it a lot.

It can take a while to play with newer players as new cards have to be read when they come out, but it's not a real problem. There's a lot that can be done simultaneously to cut down on down time and game length.

Not a deck-builder, but a "card-crafter". The distinction may or may not be useful.

In deck-builders, players begin the game with identical decks of cards which they differentiate by adding or eliminating cards. 

In this "card-crafter", players start with the identical decks and never add or remove cards. Instead, they modify the cards, themselves, by granting it new attributes.

Each card is a sleaved transparency. To change a card, a new transparency is added inside the sleeve, giving the card new attributes.

The custom-card matching is a cool mechanic that is under-realized in this game and mismatched with some other reasonable mechanics that just don't work well together.

There should be more opportunities to create combos within a card, more ability to strategically plan your deck around the cards available and VP sources available.  Currently, the information horizon is too short to plan any real strategy, so you jsut buy what you can each turn and hope it works.

I hope the expansion improve the game, but mostly hope the same mechanic is refined and used in another context.

Fun deck + card building game.  It's easy to learn and not very complex but there are plenty of decisions to be made as to how one would build up their cards.   The thickness of the cards tho sometime gives the cards away as you draw them.  Also having to always sleeve cards is very fiddly.

The base game cards felt a little same-y when we played.  Adding in the first two expansions has greatly improved the variety and made the game way more interesting for me.  

The only issue I had with the two expansions mixed in was that it seems to upset the balance of the game.  During one of our games we saw 1 card with a growth symbol the whole game.  We rarely drew enough cards to be able to purchase anything from Tier 3 because we had almost no way to mitigate the decays on the Cursed Lands we started with.  Even when someone tried to Push they were almost guaranteed to Spoil.

I'm not sure if I mind that issue though. We need to play a few more times with the expansions before I deem them too unbalanced or not.

I didn't enjoy my one play of this game because of the downtime and two of us getting shut out of the game, but I did think I might enjoy it with fewer players.  The card mechanism is great, but with 4 the cheap cards ran out early, and two of us found ourselves getting shut out of the late game cards and having useless short turns, while the other two were spending ages every turn.  I would try again, but not with 4.

I love the use of the transparent cards to modify your deck throughout the game, creating a deck building game where you never add or remove cards from your deck.

Played once and enjoyed it.  Definitively some luck dependency here but seems like enough "choices" to make it feel interesting.  The at is very nice and the card building (instead of deck building) aspect along with the push your luck theme work well.  I would imagine that future expansions will add more depth and strategy....

Have played more times now and raised my rating slightly as I do enjoy the game.

Beautiful game. It really sets a theme and creates a fantastic world.
 
However, the randomness of the draw makes me feel like I never really win or lose by my own agency. I'm in luck if I get the right amount of mana to buy the right card and be able to stick it in the right card-combo to make it work. 95% of the time, I feel like I am not able to buy the card I need when the right spot lies on the table. 

A neat game but as a more strategic player myself, I often don't feel like it is my own actions and choices that decide the game's outcome, but just some coincidence/luck.

Update: the extra content added to the game through expansions definitely helps to give the players a feeling of agency as it provides more options, strategies and combos.

I'll say this: the card-crafting mechanism has some potential.

The game feels like a test drive for that specific mechanism, and not nearly fully fleshed out enough.

This is a decent game though it does lack 'wow' factor and there's no player interaction. There's also not a lot of strategic depth to the game; it's really about just buying what you can afford with most decisions being fairly obvious and not requiring a great deal of thought.

It's easy to play but there's some minor clunk when prepping for the next turn. It's easy to get lost/confused if multiple players are doing stuff concurrently so we play by sequential turns only just to keep things under control. Overall a nice game but I can't say it's exciting.

With the expansion, I give this an 8 (6 without). 
It feels like they carved the expansion out of the original game. 

Other than the crafting mechanic, the game is not that innovative. That said, it is a nice, relaxing, quick game. It might get old, but for now, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

I think the whole thing is a little overpriced. $40 for base, $30 per expansion. The first expansion should have been included. That included, I think it's worth $50-60 MSRP, but I see how they wanted to decrease the barrier to entry. Instead, to get that true "base" experience, it's MSRP $70. The expansions feel like they'd be worth $20 a piece.

I've not yet found a AEG game that I did not enjoy, and this game is no exception. One thing that a friend pointed out as we played is that as the early card get built up, it becomes easy to stack the deck as you shuffle but we didn't worry about it as multiple cards get built up very quickly. 

We really liked the card crafting. I think it really adds a nice bit of variety for each game. We thought it would be more complex than it was, but we acclimated to the rules very quickly. This might even be good game to draw in players who do not play a lot of deck building games. It's a fun game overall, the artwork is really pretty and while the rules are simple, it has a healthy amount of strategy.

This game just does not grab me. First, it's a purely solitaire experience. No one is looking at or even caring what the other players are doing. Second, it generates the dreaded mega-turn where players are taking several minutes playing every card in their deck (assuming they are doing it properly which may or not be the case because no one is watching that closely). Granted, the mechanic of 'card-building' is interesting - I just hope a future game takes better advantage of it.

This is a pretty simple card-builder game: sort of like a deck-builder, but you're actually changing each card as the game goes on. It is quite simple, actually, although I haven't looked closely at all the powers -- maybe some of those are more complex? I really like that the deck size never changes. There's no annoying deck-thinning ... it's actually a game of deck BUILDING/fine-tuning rather than deck [i]thinning[/i]. That was what was always cool about my initial plays of Dominion: gaining cool new actions, not the hyper-tuned chapel decks that made decks as efficient as possible.

Definitely need to try this again! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Everyone starts with the same deck of sleeved cards, which are either totally empty of have something on a third (top, middle, or bottom) of the card. For setup, and at the end of each of your turns, reveal cards one by one and add to your personal display, until you reveal 3 spoil icons (that last one goes face up on your deck). 

On your turn, you may push your luck: reveal more cards from your deck until you either bust (4th spoil icon; you flip your mana token to the ready side, and your turn ends immediately) or you decide to stop. Then, spend your mana (icons on cards; and possibly your mana token, which you flip to the used side) to buy cards:
- from supply (a pile of top/middle/bottom cards that each provide 2 mana; may search through deck for what you want) 
and/or
- from the display: 3 rows -- cheap, average, expensive -- 3 cards each; replenish from face down deck immediately when card is purchased.
In addition, you may earn VP tokens or use other powers according to the card thirds you have in your display.

All acquired cards are slipped into card sleeves in your personal display (though you may not cover an occupied third of a card). Then, refresh your display WHILE THE NEXT PLAYER STARTS TAKING THEIR TURN!

Very excellent game. Perhaps my favorite "deckbuilder" if you could call it that, because you can be just a little more active when it's not your turn than most deckbuilders, which is the mechanic I wish more of these games would address.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a push-your-luck card-building game with a really unique mechanic.  In this game the cards are all clear with one of 3 segments actually showing a card piece.  So throughout this game you are building the cards in your deck, never actually adding or subtracting from your deck number.

On your turn you reveal cards from your deck (and the top card of your draw pile) until you reveal 3 of the negative symbols.  Cards also show an amount of mana (your currency), victory points, and special abilities.  You can choose to keep drawing from your deck but if ever you show 4 of the negative symbols you "spoil" and have to skip the rest of your turn (with a small consolation prize of getting +1 mana next turn).  If you don't spoil then you get to spend your mana, collect your points, and perform any abilities you revealed.  The mana is spent on card upgrades, which are the card segments that you add to the cards you revealed, so planning around how you build each card is important as well.  There are also other symbols that cancel out the negative symbols as well as ones that when you collect a certain combination you can purchase "vale" cards which give you special abilities.

The end game is very Race for the Galaxy-esque where a certain pool of victory points based on player count is exhausted.  I felt like once people ramped up to a certain point the game ended very fast.  I think this is fine, there's a clear building period and then a scramble to get the most points before end game.  The game went pretty quickly and I still felt like I got a very full experience.  There was some criticism from other players that they wished it went longer but I disagree.  That could also be colored by the fact that I won.

Bit hung up on this game. On one hand, the 'see through, craft your card' mechanic seems very intriguing to try out. On the other hand, the game is more about 'set collection' in combination with 'VP-grabbing' in order to win, which is not my favorite cup of tea. Like Dominion, this seems multiplayer-solo, with very few interaction. Would this system be implemented in a game that has more interaction between the players though, I would become VERY interested. 

As an example, I love Mage Wars because of the spellbook-crafting and the interactive element. Would the (pre-game) spellcrafting be substituted for in-game card-crafting, this would add a layer of 'I'll grab that nice card first and push my presence on the map until you counter that with some crafted trick of your own'. That would be awesome.

So all in all, would like to try it out to get the feel of the mechanic, but not overly excited about how this game uses it as it lacks interaction.

tl;dr: a very cool take on deck-building

I thought the pure deck-building game had seen the end of it's possibilities after Dominion was cloned into an infinite amount of games. And then this game comes along.
This is not technically a deck building game as the amount of cards is constant, but it feels similar because you do add new functionality to your deck. This is a very cool idea. And it's packaged in a very nice game.
I made the choice that I liked the cards that compensated for the negative icons that make your turn end. Other players didn't go for those as much as me. It wasn't like a strategic choice on my end but those cards just appealed to me. The result was that I could go through more than half my deck on in a turn on a regular basis. That certainly helped me scoring double the next player's score.
That probably helped my enjoyment of the game, but I think that even if I didn't win, I would have liked it a lot. During the game I was having fun even if I had no idea I was winning by a huge margin.
So I would recommend this highly.

I was on the fence about this one: another cardgame with yet again a fantasy theme. The cardcrafting mechanic seemed more like a gimmick. So I let it pass me by until, well over a year after its initial release, I sat down to play it at a convention. And much to my own surprise, I liked it. It is a light game, so it will not keep me interested for very long, but for us it feels like a decent game, just above the filler level in terms of time spent and depth. I look forward to the game that takes cardcrafting to the next level (Edge of Darkness).

I'm very conflicted about Mystic Vale.  It's a lot like a typical deckbuilder except instead of buying cards, you are customizing your cards by buying clear insert that you put into sleeves.  Each of your sleeves can hold a top, middle, and bottom, so you can combine up to 3 different abilities into one card.  I love this idea.  Not only do you build combos between cards like you might in Dominion, but you are also building combos within a single card.  This is amazing and has me wanting more.

The problem I am having is that it's virtually impossible to keep track of what the other players are doing (especially in a 4 player game) because I am using most of my brainpower to think about my own deck and each player's deck is fairly complicated.  You can't just see that so-and-so is going for X strategy or Y strategy, because they aren't always that binary.  Also, as far as I've seen, there is no player interaction at all (other than buying cards that other people might want).  So I take my turn, think about my next turn, then wait for other people to finish.  It is the epitome of multiplayer solitaire.  I think I would love this game as an app, but am lukewarm about it as a tabletop game.

RATING: 8.8
Essentially a deck-building game, but I still like the uniqueness of the card building mechanism. On face value it seems that card building would offer more variation, strategy and choice than a pure Dominion-like system, but trying to combine specific cards can often be hard to pull off as the card has to be in play to build upon, and your opponent can always take that next piece you need. But that also adds some interesting tension. Also the lack of a fixed tableau makes it somewhat more random, but certainly not enough to say it lacks depth of strategic options. Trying to work out whether to spread builds/strategies across cards or invest in strong one-card combos is fun and refreshing. I love how much this game feels like Dominion but different enough that I still want to play both. Can't wait to try the expansions, as it does feel like just a taste of what this system can offer.

Sure, this is one of a growing cadre of deck-building games now on the market, but the gimmick of adding new abilities to the existing cards in your deck using transparent overlays rather than adding new cards is certainly novel ... and actually quite fun. Not sure how much staying power this will have after the novelty of the overlay mechanic wears off, but I've certainly enjoyed my first couple of games.

I initially had a negative impression but it turns out it was the perfect combination of rules errors and exceptionally bad luck.

After a couple more plays, the game is really good. The card-crafting is just fun to do. It's a simple system, Dominion meets Splendor, but the card-crafting gimmick makes it feel unique enough to stand on its own.

What I really like is the way the game builds to a perfect conclusion. Early on you have some obvious turns where you only have a couple of mana (money) so you just buy the most obvious advancement. By late in the game, you may have one or two massive turns where you have 18 mana and tons of things to consider because you've played most of your deck. Then the game ends. For me this is perfect because those massive turns can become obnoxious in some games (such as Ascension) but this game keeps it contained. You slowly build up, then each player has one or two turns where they feel like a god, then the game ends and you see who won. It just feels good.

My only complaints would be that the game can feel a little long, and there is a decent amount of luck. Sometimes the perfect advancement is available to fit into one of your cards and turn it into a super card, and sometimes it just doesn't line up. Also, if someone has a good amount of luck early in the game and is able to get a level 2 or 3 card before the other players, they can snowball into a blow-out win. I'll have to play more to see how often this really happens.

Overall I'm really liking the game and can't wait to see what they add next.

The new deck builder hotness and moving the genre forward as "card building", so I have to check it out. I am a bit hesitant about buying it because I don't see much player interaction and because the consensus of reviewers seems to be that it does not have enough cards in the base game.

This rating is based off an initial play.

I absolutely love deck builders, so I expected to be more taken-in by Mystic Vale.  The card-crafting mechanic is a clever idea, and I think this really opens up games to a whole new level; I'm eager to see what others do with the concept.

Mystic feels limiting, even with the choices that are available; I think it's lack of clear Dominion-esque combos and powers on cards is part of the reason here.  (ie, there isn't a lot of draw, search, convert, etc.)  The game feels very dry compared to other deck builders and LCG's.

I will give it another shot and could be convinced to play, but this almost feels like a 5/10 to me and I would not buy it  based on my current experience with it.

RATING: 5
I'd heard a little bit about this game and wasn't sure what to think going in. The idea intrigued me, but I'd also heard some less than glowing reviews.

Mystic Vale is a deck builder with a twist. While in most deck builders you acquire cards, in MV you start with 20 cards and you improve them as you go along. Each card is broken into three sections. Many of your starting cards are blank or have a single section with anything on them. As the game goes along you buy clear plastic sheets that slot into the card sleeve. These sheets come with a new section that replaces a blank spot on an existing card. So as the game goes along you craft better and better cards. And which sections you pair together can be important.

The way the game works is that you have 9 spoil symbols in your starting deck. You keep drawing cards until you see a third spoil symbol. That card isn't available to you and becomes a face up card on top of your draw deck. Then you spend mana from the cards you've played to buy up to 2 new sheets for your cards. You can also spend symbols for bonus cards.

Alternatively, you can push your luck by saying you want to take the face up card on top of your draw deck. A new card if flipped up to become the new top of your draw deck. If the new card has a spoil token, then you've busted and your turn ends. If not, the card you took is now available to spend as well. And you can keep pushing your luck if you wish.

In the game I played, another player and I went into completely different strategies. I crafted a deck that maxed out at 3 spoil symbols (there are ways to negate a spoil symbol by adding a tree symbol to your card), guaranteeing that I could play all 20 cards in a round without busting. Which meant that by the end of the game I could buy any card upgrade I wanted. I also had a card that gave me a point for every 2 cards I played a round (giving me 10 points every turn).

The other player went for a symbol heavy strategy and was buying bonus cards left and right. By the time I got my engine up and running, I was only able to trigger my mega turn once... but I scored half my points in the game on that turn, depleting the VP chip pool and triggering the end of the game. Despite playing two completely different strategies, the other player and I were a point apart at the end of the game. Usually when different strategies end up being that competitive it's a sign of a good game balance.

I enjoyed the game more than I thought I would. It was a lot of fun. I'm not sure how much legs the game has and whether it will stand up to repeated plays. I'd like to try it more times and also the expansions. I might be worried over nothing. It's definitely got a few more plays in it at least.

Update:
After playing this four times now, my opinion of the game has crystalized.  Unfortunately, not favorably.  

There's a bit of a problem with randomness early in this game.  You keep playing cards until you see your third spoil symbol.  Which means that early luck (either in just getting a lot of spending power before you see your third spoil symbol, or pushing your luck successfully) might give you the ability to upgrade one of your cards before other players.  And those early advantages just snowball over the course of the game.  The players who got early upgrades, and have more purchasing power are able to get their second upgrade faster, etc.  

In two of my four games, I watched as other players managed to get their decks going faster than I could.  Which is just a horrible experience.  In my last game, I waited for five minutes while my two opponents finished taking their turns (with their 10 or 15 spending power) while I got stuck with a purchasing power of 3.  We repeated this a couple more rounds pretty much having the same thing happen.  I tried pushing my luck a couple of times and just fell further behind when I busted.  And because the decks are limited, it is possible that your opponents can buy all the mid level cards before you can get your purchasing power up high enough to afford any.  And then they're buying the top tier cards when you're stuck in no man's land, unable to afford those cards and stuck buying the lower level stuff.  By the end, it was taking fifteen minutes to get back to me for my twenty second turns.  I ended up doing something I rarely do and asking if they minded if I just dropped out of the game.  There was nothing enjoyable about the experience and I was miserable.

It's just too easy to have early fortune/misfortune set the course of the entire game.

1st impression: Unlikely to threaten Dominion - lacks the elegance, speed and sense of building a robust engine (sometimes it fires, sometimes not).

Oct 2017:
After nearly a year of playing, no rating change.  This is still a wonderful game and our favorite in the deckbuilder sort of category.  (I know it's a cardbuilder, but I class it with our deckbuilders.)  I'm really excited to see the newest expansion, which looks to add some sort of variable player powers.  (Yes, I've wanted that since the beginning.)  I will note that it is easy for one player to get really far ahead early on and end the game before anyone else can catch up.  I'm hoping expansions (we have the 2nd and 3rd on order) will solve minor complaints and make this game into a true 10 for us.

Original, Dec 2016:
Already one of our favorites.  It plays very well with 2 players but is just as fun (if not more) with 4.  It's a complex game with a lot of little symbols/special abilities to remember, but the style of game is really fun and not as difficult once you get going.  My senior parents played with us and are hooked - enough that they've been willing to play two nights in a row.  It's competitive without being cutthroat and long enough (can take us over an hour) without being so long it gets boring.  Each game we play turns out a little different depending on how we build our cards and what abilities we end up with, so even with 2 players it doesn't get dull.

I'd give this game a 10 if a couple things were done differently.  First, I'd really like to see each deck have something implemented to match the theming - so the deck you pick to play with gives you certain advantages/disadvantages or caters to a certain play style.  We've discussed doing this ourselves simply by having the red deck (beast) start with a vale card for a brown/beast spirit, the yellow deck (light) start with a vale card for a yellow/light spirit, and so on.  The whole reason we picked up this game was because of the druidic theming and art and it would be nice to see it implemented more somehow.

Secondly, I think it would be nice to add in a couple more competitive elements.  This could be as simply as adding in some level 3 cards which give you an ability to steal a VP from another person or give them an extra decay on their next turn.

Finally, another minor complaint I have is that the game often evolves so quickly for us that we run out of VP and end the game before we get very far into the level 3 cards or into many of the vale cards.  We may adjust the amount of VP in the pot just to extend our games a little longer sometimes.

The deck builder in which you don't add or subtract cards. Very clever mechanic in manipulating your own cards. It's easy to pick up and learn. The art is solid but really no theme. The one thing I didn't care for was the press your luck element which turned a rather strategic game into something more luck driven. Still it's a lot of fun and better then I thought it would be.

Wow this game is fun! Our first game and my daughter kicked my butt 57 to 24. She got a lot of Vale cards that gave her special abilities and points. I was locked on to getting more Mana to get more cards but filled my deck too fast.  I think it is a balance act to get Mana and symbols so you get more Vale cards. Yes there is luck on what cards you can buy and what placement they are in to be able to put them in your deck, but that is part of the fun.  If you like deck building games this is a new twist on it. A must buy.

I was pretty disappointed by this game.  I love the mechanic, but AEG fails to implement it well.

The game ends far too quickly, so players don't have enough time to build good synergy into their cards or even come close to building all their cards before the game ends.  Even if the game was longer, synergies would still be too difficult to create.  The ever-changing supply is actually a strong detriment to the game as it makes it too difficult to build synergies into cards.  Even if there is an advancement you really need that just happens to be available for purchase on your turn, you likely won't have the card you want to put it on in your current hand.

Mystic Vale has essentially zero player interaction aside from the cards available for purchase in the supply changing each turn.  But the mechanics are so strict that I think it'd be hard to add good interaction.  I would like to see cards that give their owners a benefit if an opponent does something, but I would hate to see cards that allow players to attack each other.  One major problem with implementing player interaction is that the turns play so quickly that by the time you finish the "Prep" for your next turn, all of your opponents will have likely finished their turns already.  This however is great for making the game play fast!

RATING: 7.1
Initially I found this a lot of fun but even nearing the end of the first game I found the novelty was wearing and realised that there was a distinct lack of interesting card upgrades to buy. I guess it's the problem with an essentially themeless game where it's just numbers and generic symbols on cards. It's not just that though because there really is a lack of options in the base deck.
I still enjoyed it but feel that this same mechanic would be so much better on games with a stronger theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If "cancellation" trees and vale cards (particularly those with ongoing effects) don't come up when you can afford them, you will probably lose and grow increasingly bitter.

The most frustrating thing is that, late in the game, you can generate impressive amounts of money and purchase high-cost cards - but if you don't have time to cycle through your deck and play them they're almost useless.  At least the pricey cards in other deck-builders have large intrinsic VP values that contribute towards winning.  Not in this one.

Card construction via sectioned transparencies is a fantastic idea that will eventually make its way into a better game.

My daughter begged and begged to add Mystic Vale to our collection, so we finally did. 

Overall, it's similar to Dominion or other Deck-Building games, though it uses the new "Card-Crafting" mechanic, which admittedly - it's pretty cool, but not a true game-changer (pun intended).

Changing the deckbuilder forever. Love what they have done with this game and will change how deckbuilders are made for years to come. This game REALLY needs expansions though (which they are already working on). I feel like all the creativity was put into the concept and the cards are very light in effects. Which some may love, but I'd love some new cards with more complex effects and abilities, but that's nit picking.... this game is a homerun and should be in the collection of every gaming group without hesitation.

It's not that interesting. The card building mechanic is cool, and the production value is through the roof, yet the gameplay is severely lacking. I also feel like there are few real choices each turn: just buy the best enchantment and/or vale cards.

I'd play it again--perhaps--but I'm sure damn glad I didn't buy the game. I'd be real disappointed if I did.

Finally, this game felt very similar to Splendor, only slightly better.

And Dominion has a better theme. Just saying.

Ever since I heard of the game, I’d been very intrigued. Deckbuilding games are something that Tyler and I enjoy (it’s not an instant sell, but it gets us interested) and the “card crafting” aspect sounded like a unique take on the mechanic. I also thought the artwork was soothing and beautiful. All of this added up to my purchase of the game.

While Mystic Vale will never be the deepest or most complicated deckbuilding-like game, it feels very polished. The game runs very smoothly and it doesn’t overstay its welcome. Like Roll/Race for the Galaxy, there’s a pool of VP that will be depleted over the course of the game. This is the game end trigger. While I found Roll and Race for the Galaxy to be merely “okay” games for me (though it’s possible I’d enjoy Race a lot more with more time to get familiar with the cards), I thought the VP end-game trigger was a good idea to keep the game from dragging out too long. It similarly works well in Mystic Vale (and I enjoy MV much more). It’s that tension of wanting to build up your deck, but knowing that you can’t wait too long, or else the game will end before you pull off your enormous combos. 

I was surprised at just how well the push-your-luck mechanism worked in this game (and it’s not a mechanism I generally seek out in games). There’s a safety net put in and it’s up to the players whether they want to push past it. There is some randomness in the game, between what order the Vale/Advancement cards come out and the order you draw cards from your deck, which some players may not like. It’s not any more randomness than is featured in a lot of other deckbuilders, though, and Tyler and I are both fine with that level. Since the advancements are divided into three different levels, some of the randomness has been mitigated. And since the game plays so darn quickly (especially with 2P), I never feel frustrated that my cards didn’t line up as well as they could have. All in all, very pleased with this game and looking forward to seeing how AEG expands upon this system.

Found this game to be tediously slow and the card abilities not really interesting. This results in a boring first phase of the game. I'd rather play Dominion over this by a mile.
The card crafting idea is neat, but without exiting abilities and with the slow build up, you can only start to benefit from this idea ~8 turns into the game, whereas most Deckbuilders have you feel the new cards on turn 3.

A fun deck building game, where you are creating the cards as you go.  You are trying to rebuild and repair a cursed land.  Everyone starts with the same build deck.  Then you draw cards to gain mana with out accumulating too many decays.  You then use the mana to buy advancements for you cards or buy vales to boost you power or victory points.  Whoever has the most VP when the VP pool runs out is the winner.  Love this game and defiantly will be a game night regular.

This is the newest hot game, but it's so shallow that after two or three games if you don't realize how limited it is I can't help you. I'd suggest waiting until the inevitable expansions come out that will help makes this a game. Right now it's just a boring demo of a new card building system.

Love the innovation here, but the game is lacking. It lacks much player interaction. The only interaction is the purchasing of cards that others may have wanted, and the timing of the endgame by how fast you generate victory points.

In a slow game your deck can be made such that you flop the whole deck every turn, which is what I did on my second play resulting in a 46-point turn.

I look forward to see what this designer does with this unique game mechanic. I won't buy this game, but I hope there is more to love with his next titles.

A card construction game for 2-4 people. Like a deck builder, but instead of adding cards, players use their resources to buy up to three inserts that slide into their current cards, making each one in their deck unique.

Super fast deck/card building game. Lots of options each turn with a nice push your luck aspect to it. No downtime to speak of.

This is an interesting way of delivering the deck building system. The gimmick is pleasant but the game itself is merely average. I look forward to seeing more interesting games adopting the card crafting system. Perhaps an expansion for this game will improve the game experience. I'll certainly play again and keep an eye on the game but I'm not convinced I need to buy this one.

The system is neat as hell.

It was a baaaad idea to make the Growth symbol a leafy green circle and the Forest Spirit symbol a leafy green square.  This causes more walkbacks than anything else in the game by a large margin.

Also need a better way to track decay.  Having X decay showing but also Y leafy green symbols that might be growth plus Z special abilities that could conditionally cancel some decay...is a frakking headache.

I complain a lot but really this is a very fun, challenging, aesthetically pleasing game.  A couple tweaks would improve it a lot though.

I am really enjoying this. At first, you can fumble along, and you'll be even more clumsy than fumbling through a deckbuilding game; however, once you start to catch on to constructing your cards well, and effectively manipulating your deck of fixed size (!), this starts to become not just addictive, but quite fun!

Suprisingly good card game. I need some more playes to get to the right rating, but so far first impressions are that this one will last a long while.

Tentative score based on a single demo play at Origins '16. A light game with novel implementation of *building mechanics that lead to a lot of very interesting decisions. Incredibly low player interaction, which is nice for the theme and gameplay but seems to feel missing. Apparently there is a planned expansion and AEG is using Mystic Vale to test the waters for the cardbuilding mechanic ahead of their printing of Edge of Darkness, a reportedly heavier game.

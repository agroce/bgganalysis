Santa Cruz is a game of two halves.  It offers a first half that dares to be a bit dull.  I play cards to place buildings in various locations.  Of itself this scores points, but I am also trying to achieve three vp objectives that are concealed from my opponents. They can score vps for my objectives, but whether they do is a matter of luck or guesswork.  

The second half replays the first, but with most of the vp objectives now known.  Skillful play is required to minimize what opponents score from your objectives, while cashing in on others' objectives most effectively. What to make of the two halves together?  A moderately engaging game.

The artwork is pleasing, though at least one river connection would have benefited from greater clarity.  Production quality is up to Hans im Gluck's usual standard.

Ένα ενδιαφέρον eurogame στο οποίο εξερευνούμε το νησί Santa Cruz και χτίζουμε εκεί σταθμούς και εκκλησίες. OK το θέμα είναι κάπως γενικό αλλά το artwork είναι πολύ όμορφο. Το παιχνίδι είναι ουσιαστικά καρτοπαίχνιδο. Κάθε παίκτης έχει τις δικές του κάρτες αλλά και 2 κάρτες σκοραρίσματος. Οι κάρτες είναι κάρτες μετακίνησης και δείχνουν θάλασσα, ποτάμι, δρόμο, τζόκερ. Η αναλογία των καρτών είναι διαφορετική σε κάθε παίκτη.

Το παιχνίδι παίζεται σε 2 φάσεις. Στη πρώτη φάση το νησί είναι ανεξερεύνητο και ανοίγει σταδιακά καθώς οι παίκτες παίζουν κάρτες και το εξερευνούν. Στην γύρα σου μπορείς να παίξεις κάρτα σκοραρίσματος και τότε όλοι οι παίκτες σκοράρουν την κατηγορία της κάρτας που έπαιξες.

Στη δεύτερη φάση γίνεται reset και αλλαγή στις αποστολές και στις τράπουλες των παικτών αλλά πλέον το νησί είναι ανοιχτό και μπορείς να σχεδιάσεις καλύτερα τις κινήσεις σου και το πότε θα επιλέξεις να σκοράρεις. Καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής. Διάρκεια παιχνιδιού γύρω στην 1 ώρα.

Ελαφρύ παιχνίδι κατάλληλο για όλους. Η πρώτη φάση μου φάνηκε κάπως random αλλά η δεύτερη είχε αρκετό ενδιαφέρον.

A very nice games of exploration, building and managing scoring cards. Simple enough to pick up quickly and feel you can start to appreciate strategy on the first game, yet still plenty to think about. Difficult choices, especially in the second round, about what to do first, and the opportunity for bluffing about which score cards you've held on to. Very clever for such a quick play, definitely one I'd want to play again.

[ESP] Un juego fácil de explicar y rápido de jugar con mecánicas bastante innovadoras. En tu turno puedes jugar cartas de construcción o cartas de puntuación (con la que todos puntúan). Según dónde construyan los otros jugadores debes intentar deducir que tipo de puntuaciones son las que tienen en sus manos.
Lo recomiendo.

Good family game suitable for almost everybody.  A kind of exploration game to get your buildings in areas that produce different products, in order to score with the scoring cards of ALL the players.  There are different kind of buildings are your supply is limited (reminds Taluva), and your exploration needs to follow somehow connected areas (reminds The Golden City).  I specially like the asimetric group of cards for every player, allowing different exploration possibilities.  It is a game with a lot of timing, a bit of memory, and some strategy.  Visually is quite nice, and materials are more than ok.

Interesting game of guessing and bluff.
Santa Cruz is played in two rounds: the first is about exploration and information gathering, the second is about maximizing points while trying to hide the small amounts of new information and deducting what others are trying to hide.
Rules and gameplay are light and fast, but there's some good decisions along the way.
Willing to try it with more than two player as soon as possible!

I was able to play this on BSW and, subsequently, I took it from a 1 on my wishlist to completely off of the list. It was an okay game, but it's not something that I'd need to own any time in the near future. I liked the scoring mechanic, but again, it was fairly straightforward. Lighter than I thought.

For some reason I find this game fun, but at the same time I am frustrated over how little control I have over the game. It feels too random, and that is saying something as I am a professed dice lover. This game has the wrong kind of randomness, the one that can win or lose the game for you just with the flip of a tile, and which tile to flip is pretty much randomly chosen. So why do I find it fun to play?

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting. Essentially a light, family game (real SDJ territory) and certainly the first round plays out with a real sense of "family fun", however as a gamer I enjoyed the second round a whole lot more. Having all the parts of the board revealed and a good idea of what the scoring cards would be gave much more scope for planning and attacking (or leaching off) your opponents. Very enjoyable.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly enough, I found Santa Cruz both challenging and entertaining: I thought I’d never say this about an euro but I enoyed playing this game, most likely due to it being lightly thematic (at least more than most euros ever did) and unbalanced, as far as its slightly different player decks can do.

Even though you still can’t mess with your opponents but to prevent them from reaching the best locations easily, I’ve noticed that doing random things just because they look inviting can be as rewarding as carefully planning a strategy. . [i](April 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games: although Santa Cruz is a a good game (as good as euros can be, obviously), it still can’t be regarded as one of those. Thus I rounded down my rating from 7,5 to 7, which still is kind of surprising to me as well.

Beautiful game. I like the moving and exploring aspect. I love the asymmetrical card setups for the players. I don't love the way scoring works, though. In general, I'm not a fan of games where you play hidden scoring cards, that cause scoring for everyone. People inevitably luck into scores that they had no idea were coming. And that just seems like randomness.

Not up to the par of Attika and Taluva, but still a solid game play with many interesting decisions. Theme integration is pretty awful but there are worse. Trying to remember and plan for the scoring cards you saw in the 1st round when you get in the 2nd is almost overwhelming, but also the most interesting part

A little disappointing. I normally like games with hidden objectives, but in this game it seems arbitrary when and why scoring takes place. The second round is a little better because some of the island has been revealed and you have a better idea of what other players might be going for, but it still isn't particularly satisfying overall. I wonder if introducing a drafting mechanic for the scoring cards might help this.

I don't know if I would call this a game...it is game-like...the scoring is random and arbitrary...if you don't know what scoring cards the other players hold, how are you supposed to build to take advantage of them?  It isn't like Troyes, where there are narrow goals.  It is more like Masons, except that game you only score yourself, not all the players.  Sitting down to manipulate the pieces in Santa Cruz is really just silly.  A total failure from a designer I highly respect.

Did not really stand out. Seems like a pretty generic euro. I don't really like that you can score now or choose to score later and just hope your opponents don't happen to do what it says on your card. Seemed like not enough room for bluffing or for strategic blocking even.

Players build homes, churches and lighthouses on the island while also developing valuable resources.Start with a hand of cards, comprising traveling cards and scoring cards. They then explore a board showing three islands, which have tiles laid face-down representing buildings and places, such as churches and lighthouses. Spaces near the central volcano are more valuable, but are vulnerable to a negative eruption scoring card. If that volcano does erupt, the magma might clear away the buildings already constructed.

I think this game is under-loved due to the fact that is only published in German, although it is language independent. In the first round you land on the islands and discover what's there flipping over tiles hoping to complete the secret goals in your hand of cards. The tricky thing is that all players who have achieved the goals score the points! In the second round you once again try to complete your goals, and also knowing which ones your opponents are going for. Do you forgo some of your own goals to be able to qualify for someone else's? Do you explore even further hoping for that elusive gold/wood tile? That is a risk because some tiles are left out of the game...You also want to try to get some bonus birds that can sometimes be a real game changer. An absolutely brilliant game that plays with 2 in 30 minutes! Very replayable due to variable tile placement and the combination of cards in hand. A real winner, and hidden gem.

This is a beautiful looking game with quality wooden components.  
Game play is via playing a card which shows either a road, coastal or river image depicting the type of space which can be built on.  Next, the current player can place a building (House, Church or Lighthouse) on the board following the rules for placement, depending on the card played, and the position of other assets etc.
Bonuses and points are then scored.

Everyone I've played this game with always asks for it either a second time or at the next gaming session.

Egyszerű, szép játék, amit szeretnem kéne, de nem sikerült. Egyszerűen a folyó dolgot valahogy annyira elmérték benne, hogy az fájdalmas. Iszonyatosan kevés a folyó hely, a lapok számához képest, így nagyon nehéz oda tenni, ráadásul igen korlátos készletből is választhatsz a többihez képest. A három folyókártyás meg aztán végképp szopóágon van, különösképpen ha előtte valaki a duplázóját betolja ugyanarra a folyóra, amin ő kezdett.
Kár érte, mert kicsit értelmesebb térképpel (több folyó, jobban összekötve), egy jó kis könnyed játék lenne.
A Taluva szintjét nem csoda, hogy nem sikerült megütni, mert az nagyon magasan van, de ez most nálam még az Attikát sem ugrotta meg.

Santa Cruz is almost one of the archetypical light Euro family games. The only thing that doesn't quite fit into that image is that the scoring cards can become quite nasty. Players decide when things are scored, and since you also score for other players' scoring cards (and because, at least during the first phase, you don't even know which scoring cards are in play) it's a bit of a dance to cover all your bases. That won't work all of the time, but since you play the second phase with almost the same set of cards, at least then you can see the train heading for you...

The game is quite interesting. You have to plan a bit where to build and guess what cards your opponents propably have. 
Of course there is some luck involved. If you have the card which scores for each vulcano-tile it makes a huge difference if someone else has the eruption tile or not. Also if you have the gold tile it can happen that all gold tiles are occupied by other players before you have a chance to take it for youself.
Part of the luck is mitigated by the second round.
I can't say what is wrong with the game. I would play it again without hesitation. But somehow the game failed to engage me in any way. The decisions didn't felt important enough or difficult enough or whatever...

Mine forventninger til Santa Cruz var meget høje, da et par af Marcel-André Casasola Merkles andre spil i mine øjne har været særdeles vellykkede (her tænker jeg særligt på Taluva og Attika). De forventninger er det selvsagt svært at leve op til. Men mindre kan også gøre det og vurderet på sine egne præmisser fremstår spillet som et solidt spil i den lidt lettere familie-venlige ende. Spillet er let at gå til, målene er klart definerede og differentiering i spillernes muligheder for at bevæge sig rundt på kortet tvinger spillerne til at angribe udfordringen lidt forskelligt. Spillet spilles i to faser, hvor man i den første ankommer til og undersøger øen og dermed i højere grad er prisgivet held og så en anden fase, hvor man vender tilbage til øen med den viden man har opsamlet om øen og en del viden om hvilke målsætninger der er for scoring. Et fint solidt lille spil der dog ikke er i samme klasse som Taluva og Attika.

RATING: 7
(07/03/2014) Comment based on 1 play.

This is a somewhat light exploration, action card drafting game, that is more suited for family play than gamers.

A turn consists of each player choosing a card from their hand, and establishing settlements/churches/lighthouses on the island of Santa Cruz. The various spots on the board are randomly seeded with tiles for placement of the above mentioned buildings, and thus scoring points. Players also have two secret scoring cards, which they can play a card of, in place of a regular action card, when they have fulfilled the condition(s).

The interesting twist is that each player drafts an entire "deck" or hand of cards that is oriented towards sea/land/river movement. At the end of the exploration phase, the map is cleared of buildings, and the players repopulate the island with new buildings. However, before the start of the second phase, players can choose to swap their deck with another player. Thus, if they saw another player doing well with a land-oriented deck, they could take that deck for themselves, if they were behind on VP.

The other interesting facet is that in the VP track, if you happen to end up with the same amount of VP as another player, you will lose VP until you have your own unique spot--no two scoring tokens can occupy the same VP space. Thus, falling behind early can penalize a player due to this mechanism.

All in all, a short, easy to learn, easy to play game from the folks at Hans Im Gluck. Most of their games are pretty simple, somewhat challenging in nature, and usually very accessible to all kinds of players. This is a solid "7". Not a bad game, but not one I would break out too often.

Well. This guy is my favorite designer, and he never disappoints me. I am not saying that this is the best game on Earth, but it demonstrates so many great ideas that usually takes years to come up with. The must be played scoring cards that gives points to all players is already great, but when he triggers a soft reset at the middle of the game... and you replay the board with almost full information... terrific.

The first of the two independent rounds is mostly a shot-in-the-dark. With some experience, players could guess what score cards the others are aiming for. A few spaces are probably a must like getting gold and fish. Everything else is trying to get a bigger benefit from the own score cards than the competition. The second round is where the beef is. Players know 75% of the other score cards. The decision between scoring early vs. preparing for known score cards gets interesting.
The question after one game is if Santa Cruz will be able to consistently provide satisfying playing experiences or if the chance for single players getting hosed without any fault, and ultimately frustration, is too high. I liked it but I won and might be biased.

Good game. Seems a little confuse for new players who do not realize there are in a four players game only the half of the scoring cards in play, and thus you only know 2 from 16 of that possible cards. That is very low information, and it is needed to play assuming that. The second round of the game become even more interesting. I recommended it.

A heavier family game with a used theme and quick gameplay. Changing setup adds to the replay value and the changing sets of cards with which to play do it as well. So there's definitely a lot to explore in the game and many tactical routes towards victory, although the game is able to keep it pretty even in a trueish MACM way. Surprisingly the building set used is referring to Taluva.

This is the third Hans im Glück game of Marcel-André Casasola Merkle and while it might offer a bit less for gamers, I think I enjoyed this one the most. Attika is something that feels very random first because of the random tile drawing and Taluva is a game that feels and works almost like an abstract strategy game. Santa Cruz is a bit like a mix of these: it has the cards and randomly turned-up ace-down tiles on a map but also the placement of different types of buildings (houses, towers, temples) and volcanoes that can destruct players' buildings. It also has some hidden motivation, bluffing and second guessing part that makes it more fun than the other two combined and a hint of the fun "play all your cards" rule of Kramer-Kiesling's Artus. In the end, this game is probably lighter, more family-friendly than Attika or Taluva, but also looks better and is more enjoyable than Attika and less dry and abstract-ish than Taluva. In short, as a family game, it's a winner.

A light euro about exploration. With all exploration games there's a bit of luck involved. Additionally in this one you also have scoring cards which everyone scores on when you play them. Since only you know your scoring cards you have an advantage here but the reality is that some scoring cards are just better than others. It's a less abstract feeling [thing=21791][/thing]. I did really like the mechanic of the second round where players draft another players scoring card hand in reverse order of score.

Massive disappointment, given that the designer has created some all time classics, most notably Attika and Taluva.

One play. Clever game. You know what's out there, due to the draft, and your moves to maximize your own points are obvious. What to consider is the timing. When do you score to not just maximize your own points but minimize that of your opponents? How can you leech from others' scoring cards? Need to play this more.

Further plays has raised this for me. The second round in which you have a lot more information makes this two-phase game pretty interesting.

Solid 45 minute euro game. Similar in scope and style to the likes of Thurn und Taxis and Finca. There are interesting moments of timing and priorities, and playing the second round with the (almost) same cards is a nice twist, fairly rarely seen. Not a keeper for me, but we did play four games in a row when we first played this.

Indifferent.

--- Preliminary thoughts --- 

Family light game, almost a filler, but last longer.

Not so much as bluffing but definitly double guessing your rivals

It's too random, you have little control.

Not recommended with 4, too many things are scored. Too random?

RATING: 6
Simplified and LandUnterized Die Goldene Stadt. Route building family game with quick turns and short length. 

The river deck seems very restrictive, and prone to groupthink.

Not entirely happy with Menzel's artwork: The map has some ambiguous road and river connections, and he's once again put thematically conflicting parrots in the game.

The rulebook layout is overwhelmingly busy. There is something fishy going on with the HiG rulebook department; Pantheon and Hawaii were both problematic, and this new approach isn't really an improvement over those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pleasant, relatively light tactical game where conquerors enter and island and score on different buildings (houses, churches, lighthouses) and bonuses. It involves a little bit of route planning since there are paths on land, by rivers and sailing along the coast. Most of its skill, though, lies in managing a hand of cards properly: at the beginning of the match players must choose their own stack of cards, one suiting their "colonization plans" the best and offering them some extra cards to trigger extra scores.

Santa Cruz doesn't precisely stand out for originality but it is pleasant, rather replayable (even if the outcome of a hand can be vaguely guessed as soon as the stacks have been picked up) and easier to explain than other games of its kind, making it a safe choice as a family game.

RATING: 7
It's a pleasant enough game. Each player secretly gets 2 of the however many different score cards, which might say own a gold spot, or get points for each river spot you own, etc. On a turn, play a card to get a piece out and own somewhere ... or play a score card which allows each player to score if they fulfill the card's criteria. You therefore need to know what all the possible score cards are, infer what each player is building towards, and tag on by doing the same as much as possible, as well as completing yours asap and scoring them before people can tag along on yours. At the end of the first round, after all cards are played, all the board is now known (it was gradually revealed during the first round as players played their pieces), and you go again on the known board, but after ditching one score card and getting another different one. So the game is now to infer which one did players keep, and tag along on that. In the main, turns are quick. It rewards awareness though - of potential scores, and what the others players are doing - so there's even less downtime than that which you'd normally get with a quick turn game. Making the game rewarding in that sense. I'm not sure whether replay will make the game more obvious to experienced players, or whether bluff will be rewarded. I'd probably lean towards the former, as you don't get enough turns to really bluff - you get better reward I think for getting your stuff down fast. But it is enjoyable for what it is - a rules-simple, component-beautiful, easy-to-teach, light family type Euro with nice choices not burdened by an overly deep decision tree.

While Hawaii was a HIG+, Santa Cruz is rather a HIG- concerning complexity (where Stone Age is my midpoint) making it a fast an easy game, perfect to play with non-gamers.

I especially like the 2nd round where you chose your set and scoring cards and everything is open, which is a more tactical round.

After playing this a couple of times, I must say there is more to it then you think, it's not just putting some pieces on the board. Raised score from 7 -> 8

This is a game whose mechanic relies heavily on trying to figure out what cards your opponents have.  When players lay down point cards, all players score so it is a race to lay down points before your opponents can score. I was pleasantly surprised with the fun factor of this game, and we played with just 2 players. 

Components are great, and those light houses are just too cool!

Thumbs up on this one, glad I was able to get a copy of this (not so easily done in the US.)

It's route connecting meets hidden scoring meets victory point salad. Hidden scoring gives interesting focus as certain goals should be shown and scored as early as possible, but others as late as possible - so they give you a different feel, which is good. There are 4 player's decks with different fcus and that again gives a nice variety. Then there 2 rounds with one on hidden map (everybody doing their own thing more or less) and the second round on open map with everybody knowing which goals are in the game. Hm, maybe one could just play the second round as a stand alone game - because it's the more interesting one. The game probably gets better with a bit more experience. And I should like it given I enjoy games with spacial and blocking elements and I like plenty of bluffing in my games.

But it's the euroey victory point salad with generic Menzel's artwork that gets on my nerves. I mean, really?There's too much needless fluff - like 3 types of buildings all the small details with +1 VP on tiles (yay for VPs). For what this game is good at, there's Kingdom Builder that does it better - simpler with more interaction and strategy (and art is crappy in that one as well). I think there's a good game somewhere in here if one would throw all the stupid VPs on the tiles away. And fish and sheep and all this stale euroey fluff. 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - derivative boring euro crap. And then it's not even good at what it tries to do.

Very much an old school euro design.  It totally works.  But it is a bit too utilitarian for me to get all that excited about it.  I mean, it is is a really nice design, but I feel like this was sitting on the shelf for the last 10 years and now finally got published.  Good for people that want light euros.

I can't rate it much higher though as the scoring cards can really make or break your position.  If you get the right scoring cards with the proper type of deck you can really score quite dramatically.

Like the mechanics, lovely production , i expect it to be at best with full compliment.

And with four its finet, i like the second guessing of the scoring cards, 'he took sheep, should I?' - to discover he only took sheep because he was worried you had it...

The second round is a little more cat and mouse - trying to cover the scoring cards and get the most points along the way...

As long as played at speed this is a pleasant game - pleasant being as strong a praise as I can give the game.

Note after fifth game think I am close to done as there is limited interest in replaying, unlike Kingdom Builder which is shorter , open but more interesting scoring and less restrictive placement. 

The memory element penalises those who forget - it might have been better to have a token fo reach bonus which is placed by the board for players to see what was played in the first round

Atrocious 2 player game.

Great settling theme and fantastic artwork/production. It's very quick and consistently engaging.  It's a fairly lite euro, a quick teach and fun play.  The first phase has the air of exploration, uncovering the board, figuring out how to get places and how to score while keeping it secret what you are doing to maximise it's impact.  Theres certainly some bluffing and observation in order to maximise your point gains.  All this is followed with an objectives switch mid-game, playing off what was learned in the first half.  The games second phase now becomes a strange memory/timing game, playing off what your opponents are doing and previous knowledge.

One game with four newbies. Our tactics were quite short term, but the game still felt quite good. Looking forward to play this more with gamers and non-gamers.

The victory point cards are played in interesting way, instead of an action card, you play a victory point card to get the points for yourself (and others who fulfill the requirements). Idea of the game is to settle the island of Madeira (or Santa Cruz in international version) by playing action cards and building buildings based on the played card.

Updated after second game: Basic euro game, nothing especially good or bad. No change after the third (3 player) game.

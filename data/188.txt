I finally took the plunge to add Go into my collection -- of course, it's the 3M Bookshelf edition from 1977. Go is one of those games that you feel you could just lose yourself in the depths of forever, and still come up gasping for air. You [i]must[/i] own this one if you're at all interested in abstracts...and I am, so, I own it. Looking forward to plumbing its depths a little more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Though played several times during younger days, this should really be a game for professionals (In particular as a Chinese who was acquaintained with the literature behind the game!)  Won't recommend it for leisure gamers.
Also, my rating only reflect my avoiding attitude towards the game.  The game is definitely a '10' as the earliest and best abstract game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Go rivals chess for intensity and complexity. Go's rules are actually simpler than chess, but its very human-ness makes it a very difficult game to get a computer to play. Weak chess players find it miserable to play against someone better, but Go's handicap system makes it possible for weak and strong players to sit down to a game that challenges both. If you're looking for the challenges and camaraderie of something like a chess club but without the extreme stratification you find with chess, Go might be your game.

RATING: 5
Go is more of a favorite of mine than chess is at this point in my life. Still, abstract strategy games don't thrill me as much as they once did earlier in life. 

Go is like an onion -- to overuse the expression... it reveals more depth the more you play it. My problem is I don't want to play it, in spite of it's wonder.

Go figure.

Simple rules, complex strategy. This game rewards long-term strategic planning as well as tactical finesse. An excellent handicapping system allows players of disparate skill levels to play each other fairly evenly, though the depth of play can be intimidating for beginners. 

However, the game may be too deep to warrant regular play from me. I feel it's similar to Chess in the way that study and memorization of specific game states greatly improves one's skill at the game, Go's handicapping and lack of arbitrary rules makes the game significantly more appealing for me. I just can't give the game the attention it deserves and balance it against other interests.

2011-01-13 (rating 9):

I decreased the rating as I go more and more into games with some theme (especially trains theme).

2010-04-14 (rating 9.9):

I like this game very much although I am a weak player.

There are however few things that I don't like: 1) rules differences between regions/countries/tournaments/groups, 2) rule forbidding a game state to repeat which is theoretically very inconvenient (how to trace all the states in a long game?) but practically not that important.

This game should appeal to me since I love abstracts and appreciate games with a great depth to simplicity ratio, but after several plays I still have no idea what I'm doing.  I feel like the amount of time/effort needed to become even a low-intermediate player is too much for me at this point.  Another lifestyle game that isn't for me.

RATING: 7
One of the most aesthetically pleasing games. A carefully handcrafted board with real polished stones can be a true gem. I would like to own one just for the looks.

When it comes to the game itself, the rules are deceivingly simple. Just play a stone on any vacant intersection on the board. Of course there are some illegal moves (the ko rule, or suicide). However, once you start playing that assessing the situation becomes very very hard. After several of plays it might still be a bit unclear whether you do have an area in your control or not.

I can clearly see why Go can capture the entire life of individuals. The option space is stupefyingly vast, and there is so much to learn. I reckon learning a set of cornerplays will help a lot, because then you will have automatic answers to certain openings/invasions thus saving your energy to the battles that have no clear answers.

RATING: 6
It's hard to give this a rating.  I don't enjoy it as such, but it is clearly a good game.  I don't think that it has any obvious flaws apart from the fact that it's VERY abstract and if you don't like really dry abstracts then it's one to avoid.  And this certainly is drier than most abstracts, for my taste.  

Personally, I'd much rather play Yinsh, Hive or Billabong, but I can't say that this is worth less than 6.  I simply don't enjoy it enough to rate it higher than that.

Certainly a brain-burner, and having played it I can see where some of the ideas in games like Through the Desert and other Knizia's in particular come from.

Um, well, I keep coming back to my Go books trying to get my head around this game.  I think I'm getting closer to being able to try playing -- it's just that after a few thousand years it seems nobody's come up with a simple way of telling us newbies how to know when the game is over.  It is a beautiful game, and it has stood the test of time...but I just don't see that much too it....

The abstract strategy game with the most depth.  Rather simple rules and very profound strategy.  But it is really a very heavy game which is not very accessible to novice players: you really need to be taught by a good coach (or read a good book) in order to "get started" into the game, kind of like golf or tennis; if you just learn the rules and try to explore the game on your own, it's probably a waste of your time.  A bit over-analysed by the experts, which sometimes undermines the enjoyment a bit for casual players (like me).  The best game for serious intellectual challenge, clearly above chess and the other classics.

I'm taking the subjective 'what do you feel like playing right now' side of the ranking system seriously with this score; obviously Go is a 10 from plenty of other angles.  But to newbies like me, who've read an introductory book and blundered around against other newbies, a 7 seems honest reflection of the amount of work standing between me and proper appreciation of the game.
By the way, what's with the 2000BC?  As I understand it there's quite a debate on the dating of Go, and that one looks like an outlier.

Go, I wanna like ya. I think you're purtty. And so smart, too.  But you ain't got NO sense of humour:  You are always so mean to me, Go.  How come I always get things so wrong, ever' time I approach you?  

From the way you treat me, I can see that your middle and last names--a certain verb and a certain reflexive pronoun--are too offensive to be written in a polite setting like this. And so, I must go, Go. From now on, you are Went to me.  :(

Both of these games should be in every house like a deck of classic cards is.

I was first exposed to Go in college in the context of a Machine Learning class, I found the game quite interesting and played a few games w/ professors and later a local club.  After having not played Go in several years, I found my board at my parents house and decided to teach my friends to play.  After spending an entire weekend teaching/playing Go, and then playing a friend who is at a peer level, I've decided to re-evaluate Go.

Rating this game is easy; it pretty much defines 10.  The level of intensity and focus that I experience in the game is unmatched by any other game.  The various board sizes (9x9, 13x13, 19x19) allow control over game duration.  The handicapping system is brilliant since it allows both the more and less experienced players to have a challenging experience. I've found explaining the rules is fairly easy, although it takes some time to understand 'alive' vs. 'dead' shapes and strategy.  Still, my friends are progressing rapidly and having a lot of learning.  I'm having a blast playing Go again, too.  Heck, I even had fun playing against myself one night!

I think a lot of people are intimidated by Go (and Chess to a degree) due to the competitive organized play.  I don't really care about such, and highly recommend Go for any gamer from casual to whatever.  Additionally, I feel that a moderate understanding of Go is very useful for a wide variety of other games with aspects of spatial area control (ex. Settler of Catan and relatives, Through the Desert, etc).  Overall, I simply feel that Go is an amazing game with incredible depth, yet a lot of inherent flexibility.  Go is, to me, the fundamental game and I highly recommend that every gamer be (at least) familiar with this game.

I will never be good at this game, but I can appreciate it... the rules are simple, and the game is bogglingly complex. 

Hallmark of a great design, IMO.

However, accessibility considered, this isn't going to be able to hit the table very often, and if an abstract like this one doesn't hit the table EXTREMELY often, I don't think I can really be called a "player". So I can't really rate this.

RATING: 4
Rating based on willingness to play. 
Do not like it. Or rather i do not like the sort of players that it attracts. It mostly attracts elitist folk incapable of playing or enjoying other boardgames. And seriously this debate that Go is better than Chess based on the fact that humans can still prevail over machines, is stupid. It's like comparing apples to oranges and declaring one or the other superior based on some arbitrary characteristic.

These two games are not similar at all. Chess emphasizes on the relative power of different pieces in a fluctuating board dominated by the control of the centre and better mobility. Go on the other hand does not require you to control the centre to win. On the contrary it is a serious disadvantage to play in the centre too much because you can be undermined by the flanks. There is no concept of mobility in Go. Also the fluctuation of the position is limited, i.e. there is no maneuvering. 
Last but not least, i cannot possibly stop myself from laughing when i see that the game is 4000 yr old. Yes the basic principles are but the current scoring ruleset is what? 100 year old tops? Without the current scoring methods older games played in earlier times could end differently. 
Also there is no concept of a draw in Go. This is not good and reduces the strategic scope of the game but it is of no use describing why in this forum.

To be fair the game is not bad but definately not the "best game evah". And to be frank neither chess is.

I can understand the appeal of Go. I just can't play it. I'm terrible. I have no patience for it. The strategies for winning are non-obvious and it hurts my brain. I just don't have the time for Go. I'd much rather play a German game.

WeiQi is the ultimate two-player abstract game. The character "Wei" means contain or surround, and that sums up the goal of the game. Get your kids to play early. There is a Chinese saying in that "if you're still not a grandmaster by eight years old, you'll never be one". =P

I love this game, it's hard to find people to play it though. I play chess with a few friends and after I introduced this to them, showed them the rules and played a few games they just arn't interested. Is this the best abstract ever? Probably. It's not as fun playing against a computer or over the internet though. I think it's this reason I can't devote any real time to it, like I do chess every so often.

Downgrading after a revisit.  Primary issue: I don't feel like I'm playing the game, even when I know all of the rules.  This is less of a complaint about learning curves, and more of a complaint about learning curves which I cannot envision resulting in a satisfying game for a while.

[Dec. 2009] I am not sure how to rate this game. Though I do not feel immediately drawn to playing this game as much as other 9 games, I believe that the more I play it, the more I will want to play it. I am giving it a high rating because I can easily discern that there is a world of a game to be found with more plays and accumulated experience. I can glimpse parts of that world when I am playing it and that is what will keep me coming back for more. Most intriguing.

[March 2016] Started playing and studying seriously in August of 2015. Now I am hooked. It is a game like no other. If I had to choose one game to bring on a desert island or keep in my collection, it would be this one.

Maybe the best part about Go is that it does not feel like the same thing over and over, you never know what's going to happen. Go have some very simple rules but incredible depth, you won't pick it up from the rules alone. I'm playing with a friend of mine and we both really enjoy it every time. There are cheap full scale sets to buy if you are interested, or play online for free. An excellent 2 player game if you have someone to play with.

An abysmally low rating, yes.  The simple fact is that despite how often people talk about how simple the rules are, I can't quite figure out how to play it.  And it seems too long and dull.  Possible reasons for these problems: I have a bad copy/explanation of the rules with my set, and I'm playing with too large of an area.  Still, I don't feel compelled to pull it out.

Two kinds of stones - double convex from Ishi Press and single-convex Yunzi stones. Very rewarding game, a tactile pleasure when playing with good components.

Sacrilege, I know, but I do not like this one. For all the talk of elegant rules, Go still has to patch up gaps like ko, which requires previous game state to be recalled.

But my biggest problem with the game is my teachers - I've never played against someone who has been willing to give me advice, or divulge overall strategic considerations. Consequentially, I can't read board state to see what battle is already lost, I have no idea when to start placing pieces somewhere completely different and where I should do it, and I just run out of energy and interest in playing the game after about a third of the board is filled.

Writing this, I see that the game has potential for me. But the wide open decision space is strangely unappealing to me. I like more structure.

Pretty neat abstract game.  If you are familiar with Through the Desert, you'll easily pick up this game.  The game can be easily explained in 3 minutes.  I, however, suck at the game.  This game requires a lot of planning.  If you can visualize the board in advance of what could/might happen, you will do very well in this game.  I actually enjoyed watching the game, which is very surprising since I am not that big of a fan of abstracts.

I mostly play it on small 9x9 board and treat it as a thinky filler, plays last about 15 mins and yet even on such small board decisions to be made are far from obvious from my amateurish point of view. I think I like it more than chess as I have a feeling that here planning moves in advance is less mandatory than in chess, and this is something which tire me in games.

A solid scaled-down version of GO with a wooden board and stone pieces. A great set for someone who wants GO in their collection without committing to a larger, more expensive set, or having a total piece of junk in their collection.

The game for a lifetime in my opinion. Multiple sized boards allow games from 10 minutes to an hour with a sliding focus between tactics and strategy.  Handicapping is natural and allows two players with very disparate playing levels to enjoy playing each other. Effectively infinite replayability. Tons of players and articles, especially online.  Can be played with a sheet of paper and some coins.

I am a beginner at Go slowly getting a deeper understanding. Its simpler than chess in that there are less rules but it appears to be just as deep. I've limited myself to playing in the 9x9 grid board to learn fundamentals. In the smaller board mistakes become apparent faster, as there is, literally, less room for error! Games are played to their conclusion faster, allowing the beginning player more opportunities to try again and learn. Another option for teaching is to play first capture go, were the first player to capture a opponent's piece is the winner. Chess isn't nearly this easy to teach.

Go is the greatest game of all time. Go is so far ahead of the other board games in the world, it should not be rated a ten, but should instead be praised infinitely. If you have not tried go, it grows in strategy and interest the longer you play. Strategy in Go becomes deeper with every game and your desire to become stronger at Go can become overwhelming. I have never enjoyed anything as much as I enjoy studying Go.

Go is such a good game it should be considered at a different level entirely.

Go is a difficult game to rate because it is a game that you basically get out of it what you put in.  To fully enjoy and appreicate the game it does involve some study to get to the point where you are not just placing stones randomly and that your moves have purpose.  Very deep, lots of fun BUT on a 19 by 19 grid it does take a little long and unless you are able to pull off a massive stone capture the game ends with a plod not a sprint.  Still awesome abstract game if you have the time to put in and the opponents to play with.  Not played for a while but thinking of taking it up again.

This is based on my playing a 9x9 implementation called IGOWIN on my computer.  I've determined I simply cannot play this game face-to-face (since I can't "read" the board), so I will never try.  I get some enjoyment playing against the computer, although I lose about 50% of the time.  Perhaps if I can beat it more consistently, I'll try playing against live opponents, albeit over the internet.  We'll see.

I respect the simplicity of the game, although I am frustrated that I can't wrap my brain around the strategies required to do well.

This is true of most abstracts, which is why I'm not a big fan of them.

Go is an amazing abstract game that has thousand of history behind it. You simply cannot approach Go as you would for a traditional game, time must be invested to learn about the basics in order to enjoy the game. Go has unlimited replayability and it is very difficult to master. The fun in Go is not just playing piece and beating your opponent, but rather it is about critically thinking about the whole board and each of your moves to outmanoeuvre your opponent's traps and strategy.

Go is king of the abstracts. The only down side is its length, which can seem grueling at times. It makes an outmatched opponent feel like he's being tortured.

I may always want to play it, but unfortunately I don't have time to put the proper study into it!  I own a medium-nice set, a cheaper but still nice looking set in the office, and a portable set (not one of those dinky magnetic things; a folding wooden board with two bags of plastic stones inside).
  
I keep this game around, even though I'm rather bad at it, because it is beautiful, elegant, and I really love it for all that it is in the end.  It is the premium area control game---El Grande and Trias don't even come close.  I have three beautiful sets---though they are not all expensive, but do all have wood boards.  I might get a magnetic one, too.

What a game!  It always amazes me just how nuanced and complex this very simple game can be.  It can be as simple or as rich as you as a player choose to make it.  Check out Janice Kim's books on the game to get a really good instruction (currently at 5 volumes).

My interest in Go was first piqued by the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, who wrote about it in A Thousand Plateaus. Years later, I took the time to learn it and notched up a number of games online. It took me dozens and dozens of attempts before I was able to win. I then set about making my own homemade copy of the game, before realising that it's not really for me. I'm not left-brained enough for such a dry and abstract game. I still have massive respect for Go and am glad I was able to gain an appreciation for it (if nothing else than as an intellectual exercise), but I doubt I'll ever play again.

Told to me by a Korean player many times better than I am:
(1)  "You need to build more house".
(2)  "Don't try to take everything.  Take more than half."

More practical advice (or perhaps less practical advice) for those looking to try go:

(1)  Steer clear of beginner sets that have pieces the size of M&Ms.  The awkwardness of those detracts from enjoyability.

(2)  It is the custom to play this game briskly and is considered impolite to dawdle extensively when making a move.  That isn't to say not to think things through, but don't get hung up.

(3)  It is also the custom to resign when faced with a certain loss, except in a teaching game or when both players agree to play it out for fun or learning.  This is a good practice and should be extended to other two-player games.

(4)  Ing's counting method is great.  That doesn't mean I use it.

I love this game. I'm not a good player by any means, but it's SO much deeper than chess that comparing them it's not even fun. As Trevanian wrote, "Go appeals to the philosopher in any man and Chess to the merchant in him." Feeling is as important as reason in this game.

Go is the most beautiful and elegant game ever. The flow of the game, the shapes of the stones in the board, the way everything makes sense when you begin to get better... The way a move is not just good or bad, but beautiful in itself.

Go has just the perfect balance between strategy and tactics, between small-scale thinking and whole-board situations, attack and defense.

I have two sets: A bigger one (http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1246597/blackleadalchemist) and a small travel magnetic set (http://img04.taobaocdn.com/bao/uploaded/i4/T1ADjvXaNqXXctPQ31_041829.jpg)

I would love to be good at this game. I have played on a few occasions and performed horribly. The game is so simple, yet so deep.

I've decided that I'm going to make a bit more of an effort to learn this game. I'm going to try and play some regular games against a 3rd Dan that attends QUGS.

I am enjoying Go more and more each time I play. I feel like I am improving and making less silly mistakes.

Now I attend the [URL=HTTP://www.Brisbane.go.org.au]Brisbane Go Club[/URL] regularly where I [-]am[/-] was by far the worst player, but I feel like I'm improving more rapidly.

I've gotten a little bit frustrated with Go recently. I'm not really improving. I'm going to give it a rest for a while and see how I feel in a year or so. Rating reduced to 8.

Back to the BGC while struggling with an injury, enjoying the game again.

Cannot believe it took me until my forties to finally play this game. And than it was my nine year old's love for abstracts that led me to try it. And boy, is this a great game. Simple rules and near infinite possibilities make this a tense struggle for victory from start to finish. I normally do not like abstracts but Go has awoken something inside me that I didn't know existed.

The difference between a game like Go and Chess is that while Chess is unintuitive, the mechanics of Go are the opposite: surround a piece and it falls. And yet the refinery of method possible makes a huge distinction between good and bad players. Which means you have a steep learning curve and a long way to something akin to mastery. This is the same problem as Chess and yet the elegance of the rules here makes me like Go so much more (even though I am a very poor player and rarely get to play).

The recent AI developments have somewhat killed this game for me. It has been revealed that good strategy is all about repeating the same patterns endlessly.

I think Go has some mystic qualities. It's a game of finding balance. Try to bite more than you can chew, and you lose. Play it too safe, you lose. It resembles the Yijing, Yin and Yang, heavy and light. I like how much intuition goes into playing this.

Funny how I was a bit scared of this game, it seemed like a huge commitment. But it's not, really. The learning curve is a bit steep in the beginning, but once you get over it it's plain fun, as long as you can find someone about your level to play with. And online, you can always do that. Even if you couldn't, there's handicaps, and they work well.

If you're going to play online, I recommend online-go.com. I haven't tried many other websites, nor want to. Know the difference between live (short) games and correspondence (long) games.

I followed an advice from someone here in the Geek, to take it slow, start on the smaller boards and slowly go up. I established a rule that I had to play 25 games on the 9x9 board, then more 25 on the 13x13 board, before I could play the full game. Now, that was a silly thing to do. I think a handful of games on each of the smaller boards will do. Better than setting a fixed number: feel your way.
EDIT: Actually, I did do a lot of tsumego before I started playing. If you don't do that, then it may be really a good idea to take it slow.

I made a DIY 19x19 board and bought a set of ceramic stones. The game on 19x19 takes too long for a beginner so I would recommend making a smaller 13x13 (or smaller). As a beginner you tend to make dumb moves as well as repetitive chasing across the board which leaves you in a game across the whole board (one BIG war instead of several small battles). All in all best abstract out there and I've played my part of chess.

My previous commentary seems puny now:
______________________

Many, many games played, lesson books read, Go 'problems' studied--nothing helps!  It will still take a lifetime to dig deeply enough where I might feel proficient at this game (of course, I set my expectations pretty high.)

She loves the fact that it has a lot of history to it

It transcends the more human theme of chess. Watching a high level Go game is like watching an artist paint on a canvass. Chess can be like this as well, but I'm going to stop comparing them on this note: I love chess, but I can't help but admit that Go is the better game. It might just be the singlemost simple, yet incomprehensibly deep games to ever be produced by mankind.

VERDICT:

Regardless of my numerical score, I'm pretty sure this is the best board game ever invented (even if I'm terrible at it!).

I learned how to play Go in early 2010, but it deserves a 10 just because of its depth and aesthetic beauty. It saddens me to admit I will never be more than a casual Go player, but I cannot spend the time required to be good at it. Oh, and Go beats Chess hands down for me.

RATING: 6
Go is so good, but the game is too long and the learning curve of centuries of play style and distinct moves can be a bit (ahem, quite) steep. I love playing on a full size board, but it becomes so brain burny that invariably one mistake loses a player the game. Still if you play on a small board and dont worry about specific moves, the mechanisms of this game are simple, interactive and very fun.

The King of Games in my opinion.  Elegant but unendingly deep, strategy-wise.  I only wish I had more time to master it.   Simple rules (though a bit marred by some annoying rule differences between countries, and some debate over complex but rare ko situations).

I also like the fact that via handicaps two players at different skill levels can enjoy the game.

My one complaint is that the 19x19 game takes longer than I usually have to play a game.  You can play on smaller boards, and those can be fun, but they are not as strategically satisfying as 19x19.

This is quite possibly the greatest game ever created. It is incredibly deep, very intense, wonderfully stylistic and well worth studying. It is a game, a conversation, and an art form all at once. Your thoughts and emotions are played out on the board and tested against your opponent's. The game is very intuitional and leaves great room for style in strategy, while providing a neverending well of interesting and deep puzzles and tactical problems to think about.

It's the oldest game in existence, by a margin of thousands of years compared to the runner up. Seriously, what can be said about Go that hasn't already been said? Surely not "good game".

My rating will go up if I ever get into it enough to study consistently. When that will be, I don't know, as I like to play a variety of games and my one "lifestyle" game slot is already occupied by OCS.

UPDATE: I finally committed to playing more consistently and doing a little studying. Predictably, this has become a 10 as a result.

The rules maybe simple, but the implications are not. I tried playing from the rules, but the game was at best a six. I've now started reading a book on how to play in order to learn the skills of Go, and the game has gotten a lot better.

Which is kind of the problem with the game. While it would be trivial to find opponents online, I don't know anyone in my life who is interested in investing that time so that we could play.

Boring, I really could take it or leave it.  Yes, it is extremely deep but it's just so blah... I've played a couple dozen times and it just wasn't fun enough to justify all the extra over-head.  Chess is life-style abstract for me even if it is more programmed and probably not as deep. I tend to have this problem with area-control type games: I just don't enjoy them. 

Just doesn't get my neurons firing in a fun way.  I'd play again, but I think I'd have to sit down with someone who would be willing to take the time to explain the damn thing to me.

I'm just not a fan of high skill ceiling games, I think. I crave variety in gaming - so games that aren't fun unless you devote huge quantities of time to practicing them aren't fun to me.

Also - I'm not quite sure why this game has a reputation for being really simple to learn. I don't feel like I really grasped the game even from a beginner standpoint after one game. It probably does not help that my brain isn't at all wired for visual games, though. But even then Chess came more naturally to me than Go did. I've played a couple games now and the rule for eyes still elude me.

I'm supposed to say something very profound just because the game is very ancient. 

Abstract game. As often marketing descriptions say: "Easy to learn and difficult to master". Start it if you're looking life-long and respectful activity. Probably you'll not get a lot of fun from the beginning but what important is "atmosphEEre". Black & white stones, wooden board, straight back. 

And remember Jet Lee's movie. While heroic general and millions soldiers were dying, three old politicos played Go sealing their fate.

I must dissent. I have played maybe 50-60 games of Go, and I still have absolutely no idea what the hell I'm doing (and I'm not a complete moron). I have gotten better, but I don't even know why. When do I get to the rewarding part? I understand that it is the deepest game there is, but it is a boring exercise. Chess (play with the random setup if you want to avoid opening theory) is a much more graspable flavorful experience. Go is probably the 10ist of 10s if you want to devote thousands of hours to it, but if you want casual, hell, even only semi-serious play, look elsewhere.

Go is a very simple but deep game, and I definitely understand why it’s so popular and have survived and been played for thousands of years! However, my rating is a personal reflection (like all of my ratings) of the fact that I simply don’t want to play this game much. It’s a nice abstract and all, but I don’t really fancy abstracts, and those I like tend to be shorter. I don’t want to overanalyze every move, and I think many abstracts can lead to this problem as there isn’t any randomness inherent in the game, so players think a little longer about what to do. I’m a big opponent of analysis paralysis and I don’t want to spend too much time playing an abstract game. And with Go’s 19 x 19 grid there is a LOT to think about and plan ahead after the first handful of stones have been set. So, while Go is a good abstract, it’s just not particularly enjoyable for me. I’ve also played Capture Go which I would rate higher as it’s tenser and shorter.

Classic abstract. There's no luck involved, so it's a game of pure skill. I like it because of the simplicity of play and the very hard decisions. There's many games that can form through a Go board, which is cool. You pretty much have to play someone with equal skill or you'll lose, it's not really a game with many variables.

Still very much a novice.  Have been playing of late on the 9x9 sized board.  One aspect that instantly grabs me is how easy it is to handicap the game, makes it much easier to find players actually willing to play!

Am interested in learning more, but will probably never devote the massive amount of time it takes to become very proficient.

A most fascinating ancient (in the range of 4000 years!) territorial game. You can  learn the rules in a couple of minutes, but you can play it all your life and never master it. Computers are known to have serious trouble beating human opponents, even relatively weak club players, making it a popular game in AI contexts. 

In spite of being a great game it doesn't really fit me as much as Shogi (Japanese Chess) or Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), so I don't play it much anymore. 

It is no overstatement to say that it should definitely be tried at least once by anyone who is serious about board games.

Go is a great abstract strategy game, probably *the* abstract strategy game, I just dislike trying to pick up games that have been studied extensively, where knowing that back knowledge is essential to the game, and that is definitely the case with Go. The complexities of this game are such that countless tomes have been devoted to it, and the length of the game kills me, particularly when I'm getting my face smashed in. That said, there's a certain pleasure in playing this, and the 'feel' is entirely unique, I always feel like I'm absolutely killing my opponent, or that I'm being ground into the pavement with little in-between; huge offence gives way to desperate defence in short order in this game, and the swings alone make it stand out in my mind. All this said, I can't rate it higher than a 6 because the game really requires dedication to reach its potential, and I just don't want to put in the time.

RATING: 8
I love this classic game. It is so much deeper than it appears. I fear I will never have the time to get as good as I would like, but I enjoy the challenge of this game every time.

Edit (Jan '15)
I suppose it is inevitable that one must make a choice about Go. Either you will commit to it deeply - a lifestyle game, if ever there was one - or you will enjoy it casually for a while before that becomes too frustrating to maintain. I have fallen into the latter camp. I want to be good at it, but I want to play other games, too. So that means I don't devote much time to Go. I could say, "that's too bad." But even as brilliant as Go is, it is just a game - no matter how brilliant and beautiful. Now, if you'll excuse me, my six year-old daughter is asking if we can take the training wheels off her bike. Life is brilliant and beautiful, too.

I'm still learning the strategies, but it's a brain-burner that's worth the time and effort. I find myself mostly playing online, as there aren't many opponents in my area.

January 15, 2010 -- As of last night, I have played 55 games of Go. Many have been online or against an AI, but I've turned one friend into a fan of the game. We've played a few games when we have the chance, but we're both still learning the strategy and tactics of the game.

It's true what they say about Go. It only takes a few minutes to learn, but mastery could take a lifetime. I wish I'd started playing as a kid instead of learning as a thirtysomething. While I'm improving slowly, many strategic elements and patterns still elude me. However, I'm seeing where I have improved now that I'm playing against someone brand new to the game. I can see flaws in his moves that I have already overcome.

I still quite enjoy Go, and I think I'll get a chance to play more often now. No change in rating. 8/10

RATING: N/A
 This game is amazing. Simple rules but great depth: the epitome of a great board game. Stategy, tactics, psychology - this game has it all. 

If you become bored with most games after a few plays, then try Go. It's a game you may enjoy for the rest of your life.

Games of Go are often intense. For ancient Chinese, Go was a path to self-improvement. It's a martial art in board game form. 

Go can definitely be enjoyed at the beginner level. However, unlike many games, Go is not a game you can just pick up and play well after a couple plays. It requires patience and determination, and some initial frustration is common. It takes experience (and/or study) to recognize the implications of the simple rule set. I think some people don't give the game enough of a chance. 

My recommendations:

- Start on a 9x9 board. 
- Read the basic rules, such as these: http://www.usgo.org/usa/waytogo/W2Go8x11.pdf. 
- Take this tutorial: http://playgo.to/interactive
- Get a book like "Go for Beginners" by Kaoru Iwamoto and learn some basic strategies and tactics. 
- Play lots of games, make lots of mistakes, and learn from them: Download "igowin" and play against the computer, or play live in person, or play on the internet at http://kgs.kiseido.com (real-time) or http://www.littlegolem.net (turn-based).

I am playing this game on an I-pad app (SmartGo) that scales difficulty based on playing skill.  Go is an amazingly deep game for such simple rules.  I think it would take a lifetime to master.  My fascination and wonder at this marvelous game increases more every time I play it. A five year old could learn this game, play it everyday for the rest of his life and still find it to be infinitely rewarding.  I understand why some consider playing this game to border on the mystical.

RATING: 8
The undisputed king of abstract games, unsurpassed in terms of depth and complexity. Initially I thought the game's depth arose because of the large amount of possible moves you can make, but in actual games you're actually quite confined. (Read: most moves don’t make a lot of sense.) No, the complexity sets in because of the fact that at some point you’ll actually be playing several games of Mini-go on the board, attempting to make up for loss in one such minigame with winning in another. The game is therefore a very good example of complexity emerging from simple rules, which is an intruiging concept to build a game around. It makes for lots of longevity, which is a Good Thing.

It is impossible to begin playing Go without immediately running headlong into a rules issue dealing with a crucial aspect of the game: the end, and determining the score. I wracked my head about this for many hours until I finally got some sense of what was happening and why, and could explain it in terms I understand. I was told that the more popular Japanese rules using their quicker territory scoring (prisoners + empty surrounded area) would 'punish' you for playing into your own territory—and they do, of course. Not something you'd like to hear as a beginner. Then the 'easier' Chinese rules seem more appealing: no such penalty! However, this misses an important point that the two methods of scoring are [i]equivalent[/i], and nearly always yield the same point [i]difference[/i]. So if the Japanese rules are 'unforgiving', then so are the Chinese. [i]The[/i] point is—and remember this if you're starting out—is that the Japanese rules use a twisted definition of the emergent game properties of life and death to determine a group's viability, and thus whether territory belongs to one player or the other. It also needs to introduce rules about the handling of neutral territory. For beginners this means opening a can of worms because the procedure for determining life and death is quirky to say the least. There are of course many 'obvious' cases, but once you get into corner territory things get hazy and weird, and that's simply overasking. Far simpler is to simply let such emergent properties and neutral points be and just let the players decide for themselves, restricting matters to territory which is [i]sure[/i] to be under a player's control. If the players make mistakes here (for example by finishing prematurely when there is still territory to be won) they will only know by playing against someone else who is aware of these finesses anyway. What then remains is the difference in counting: the Chinese way—area scoring—ignores [i]dame[/i], and counts stones + empty surrounded territory. This is more cumbersome, but has the undeniable advantage that a player with a strong board presence will also have a large (and likely winning) score. Once you realise all that [i]then[/i] Go can be played with very simple and very straighforward rules, turning it into the sleek monster computers still have problems with. The rest is just window dressing to introduce some finer granularity to make up for first player advantage, handle the [i]dame[/i], do something about passing, and so forth. Interesting when skill level begins to amount to something (and then only in limited fashion), but not before.

I like this game, although I was unpleasantly surprised by my girlfriend who found it merely ‘ok’ even when played on the 9 × 9 board. After a bit of discussion it transpired that she found the game to be unpleasantly abstract in the sense that in her opinion I beat her too easily. She likes games with (reverse) psychology and intuition better because it allows her to push my buttons and in the process give her a better chance of winning. I then introduced her to the concept of handicaps, and this improved matters considerably to the point where she could win; afterwards she stated she wouldn’t say no to a few more rematches. Progress indeed!

Go is, for the moment, on a low burn. I have a fairly strong club in the vicinity which I should attend in order to make some progress beyond the 9 × 9 games I’ve been playing to date. But for now I lack the time for serious study. It is my hope that one day I can remedy that situation, as I think I would like the full game very much indeed.

RATING: 8
Go broke my heart, because I SO wanted to like it.  In the end, I had to accept the fact that it simply doesn't do it for me.  I want more drama in a game.  I want decisive actions, crushing blows.  Go is very subtle and indirect.  It feels like trying to put out a forest fire with water balloons.

I can still appreciate the game on some level, and have the utmost respect (and envy) for those who do enjoy it, but it's simply not for me.

I expressed my feelings best in [listitem=1977414] this geeklist entry.[/listitem]

UPDATE: I must have Stockholm Syndrome, because even though I dislike the game, even after swearing it off forever, I just can't stay away.  Raised the score a point accordingly.

UPDATE: Okay, we're officially back together.  Giving it another go.  For the childrens' sake.

The greatest of the two-player abstract games, in my opinion. I recommend the book Learn to Play Go by Janice Kim and some other guy for beginners.

As of this writing, I have rated 7 games (out of about 250) a perfect 10 on the boardgamegeek scale.  Go is the only one that I am fudging a little--while all of the other games earn their position based on the fact that I really do want to play them any time, and always enjoy them, Go is not a game I can play occasionally.  I have to either be playing it seriously, or I can't play at all; lately, I have not been playing at all, and I don't expect that to change in the near future.  Nonetheless, I still think it earns the high rating I give it, and someday I intend to return to Go and to start playing seriously again.  And despite the fact that I don't want to play much nowadays, I can't bring myself to rate it less than a 10.

Nobody really gets it when they start to play. I will admit I have been very frustrated with this game! So frustrated I stopped playing for about 3 months and came back to improve by 3 ranks!

Components: One of the simplest, yet most visually-appealing games I've played. The board in-play is a sight to behold.

Experience: Such a complex game from such a simple rule set; I can see why it's the world's most popular game. I've enjoyed my time with it, but I really feel like I'm fumbling around on the board with little direction. I feel that a player must be skilled for an interesting game to develop. The opening game is too directionless for my tastes. I also have quite a bit of trouble knowing when the game is over.

I need to get back into this.

Burns the brain pretty intensely when learning, and there seems to be more and more layers to the game as the learning progresses.

The last time I got into this it finally clicked that influence can be used as a staging ground for moves that are dual-purposed with regard to strategy, whereas I'd previous only played dual-purpose moves with regard to tactics.

Pushing through a book on tesuji certainly helped my reading and gave me the confidence to approach the game at the higher level, knowing I could reach an equitable outcome regardless of which strategy I had to adapt to.

I did originally get into this game. But as I read more, I came across a startling quote that tournaments have had to be decided by a judges decision, since both players claimed ownership of parts of the board. I'm sorry but if there isn't an objective way to determine the winner, then this hardly counts as a strategy game. So is this game broken or is there something I (and others if there is such a thing as a tournament judge) am missing?

At the lowest level, simply making sure that your pieces aren't needlessly taken - watching out for what is in Atari - is a challenge.

Then you start intuitively learning about sente.

Threatening opponent's pieces, recognising the patterns that can make life, connect or defy invasion.

There's a constant feeling of insight as within each game, surprises abound, mistakes happen and lessons are learned.

The handicap system keeps games exciting between players of a widely disparate level.

Better than Chess? The pointless and stalemate debate rages on. I love it, but seldom get to play it, so buying a true goban is out of the question for now.

Go is quite simply the easiest game to learn and the hardest to master.  I have to admit that I made the mistake of reading some of the reviews of Go and I might have lost some faith in humanity a little bit.  It makes complete sense to me that someone who posts the comment "This is the worse game ever" wouldn't understand how to play.

There are people that dedicate their lives to mastering Go.  That's how much of an impact this game has had.  I love go, even though I'm really not very good at it.  For those of you who don't understand the game please realize that once you learn the basic rules of the game it becomes one of the hardest games to play.

The deepest of game play, with a rule-set about 3 sentences long.  The definition of emergent tactics/strategy.  Recently, AlphaGo has shown that despite thousands of people over thousands of years literally devoting their lives to understanding this game, our combined knowledge is still leaps and bounds from mastery.

The only game truly deserving of a perfect 10.  I regularly play 3-5 games of Go each week. While many other excellent games may shine brightly, I don't believe any of them could come close to surviving that many consistent replays without becoming dull rather quickly.

An ancient game of pure strategy and area control that spawned many of the mechanics you see in modern strategy and area combat games.

Many variants can be played of this wonderful little game on a standard GO board and any pure strategy or abstract game buff should teach themselves how to play this at some point in their lives. 

Well worth a play and you'll often find players of this little gem in the most unlikely of places.

Go is the quintessential war game. What I found particularly interesting is that the 9x9 sized game is like a knife fight in a room, a 13x13 game is like a single battle, and the full 19x19 game is an entire war.

Still, one of the most beautiful games.

Well, I really don't care much for Go. It suffers from the same problem as Chess, one of being overly studied and analyzed for centuries, so one would now have to study it for a long time, to be able to play adequately. No, that's not even close to what I want to do. I also find it quite unintuitive, so I tend to lose heavily against pretty much anyone. But of course, I admit that Go is a very deep and thoughtful game, it just doesn't have the appeal for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I want to give this a higher rating but it is highly unlikely that I would ever suggest playing Go.  I also don't want to play this as an intense brain burner very often (if ever).  I simply want to play by hueristic principles and by what "feels" right.  Like, I have a sense that this move would be trying to claim too much territory so I'll play here instead.

The big problem with playing this game is in finding someone of similar abilities, but I am in awe of this game more than almost any other game I've ever come across.  This is simply an amazing game.  It fills me with wonder.  It's just that I would rather play a computer version quickly than against a human opponent.

Immense strategic and tactical depth from the most simple of rule sets. Add in wonderful aesthetics and a long historical tradition and you have THE classic boardgame. 

The fact that this is now outside the top 50 on bgg is quite simply absurd and shows up the rating system on BGG for the farce that it is - 50 games are better than 'Go'? I wish we were so lucky! If human civilization manages to last another thousand years this is the only game in the top 100 that will still be being played.

Go has a subtlety and depth that is redolant of eastern philosophy. It is all about balance and shape. Even though it is an abstract game it has a deeply human quality and there is something very sensual about the feel of the stones and the sound they make as they hit the board. If Chess is the king of board games then Go is the queen.

Has a very different feel than any other abstract I've played. Stones are played by geometrical intuition as often as they're played by tit-for-tat calculation. I find this to make for an equally deep, but less stressful game, that nevertheless builds in excitement and has as much of a "story" as themed euros.

My wife and I started by playing 20-minute 9x9 games, and have moved up to hour-long 13x13. The flavor does change significantly as the board gets larger, and multiple areas play separately, then slowly coalesce.

I've just recently started playing Go.  Actually, as I am trying to teach my wife at the same time, we've been going through the modified phases here: http://www.sentex.net/~mmcadams/teachgo/

Basically this involves playing on a 9x9 board and focusing just on capturing until both players are comfortable with the mechanics.  I anticipate that we'll move onto territory shortly and then a 13x13 board after that.

There is a reason this game has been played thousands of years.

One of the oldest games in the world.  Even though it is an ancient game, it is still played the same way (for over a thousand years at least).  It has simple components, almost no setup, and pretty simple rules that can be picked up quickly.

That is where the simplicity ends.  The more you play, the more you learn, and the more complex and fascinating the game becomes.

There is nothing new and exciting about Go.  It is only a perfect game that has been played by our ancestors, and that will be played by our decendents.  

I only rate this a "9" because I haven't played it enough.

I am utterly fascinated by the mechanics of Go. I've been into Chess since I was a little child, but only discovered Go in the past couple years.

The biggest trouble with Go is finding an appropriate partner. I'd happily play with someone else eager to learn over repeated plays, or a superior player willing to put up with my learning. Unfortunately, I've tried to teach it to a few people and most don't find the same level of joy in it.

Despite my inability to play it, I have to rank it high for the level of respect I have for the layers of strategy behind this game.

Played a few games of Go when I was younger but never really got into it properly, though I did find it interesting and much more appealing than chess. A bit overwhelming though maybe? A recent renewed interest in abstracts prompted me to try an app version and I've been loving the 9 grid game. The spatial aspect which interested me originally is really starting to reveal its true depth now. I found the 'territory' board view in the app really helped to get my head round that aspect. Looking forward to this game growing with me through life, it feels like it will always be relevant somehow.

It is great to learn with someone who's the same level as you, but it also has an excellent handicap system (and there is no shame about it).
Don't let someone tell you it's for an elite or that you have to play in a certain way. Enjoy it.

This is a new experience to me and I am humbled by the depth. My daughter got me playing this and we are discovering that we could play for donkey ages and still not have the game mastered. This game appears to be simple however, it is full of ancient strategy and secrets.

This is a truly excellent game comprising simple, abstract board and pieces, almost no rules, and gameplay which allows extraordinarily rich strategy. Chess for the purist mathematician. Can be stunning to look at: I obtained my board (which weighs a ton) and pieces in Japan for an outrageous sum of money and it looks beautiful even when not in play...

Go manages to be totally simple and yet utterly complex. Every strategy game ever pales in comparison to this. Every "simple to set up" game pales in comparison to this. 

The only reason this doesn’t get played is when I am too tired (read: any time after three hours after waking) or when we want beer and pretzels games.

This may be the best game ever, but until I can figure out a way to get someone to play with me, I'll never know.

The few times I have played, I tried to play more beans than my opponent, but we always seemed to get about the same number on the board.

I did make the prettiest designs though. That should count for something.

Best abstract 2-player strategy game ever invented, with subtle tactics, deep strategy, and special pattern recognition, all deriving from very simple rules: if your orthogonally connected group of stones reaches no empty spaces, it's removed.  Score is number of empty spaces surrounded (ok, not quite that simple, but almost).

[2014 July 06; 12 plays; 8/10]
This is a astonishing game! I feel this game is deserving of a 10/10 rating, but not necessarily from me; it's a game that gets better the better you get at it. I think this is a game I'd like to play and understand more, but as simple as it is, it's very intimidating for new players--they can tell that it's incredibly deep the moment you start playing with them. Because of this, I have a hard time find people to play with and I feel "forced" to rate it an 8/10.

I find the game even more enjoyable with high quality stones and board, but I have probably the worst board and stones on the planet: thin fiberboard with uneven lines and thin melamine plastic stones. Once I have more plays I'll likely buy something slightly more lavish (hopefully a shin-kaya board and yunzi stones).

[2014 October 05; 13 Plays; 7/10]
I hardly play this. I really enjoy it, but I think it's a little silly of me to rate it an 8/10. Even a 7/10 is perhaps too much. This game would very easily raise higher for me (I think it's a great deal of fun!), but I don't suggest it very often because it's hard to find people around me who find any interest in it.

Néhány egyszerű szabály és elég nagy játéktér így együtt a Góban olyan szerencsésen áll össze, hogy a Föld egyik legkülönlegesebb logikai játékává teszi. Az egyszerű egymás utáni lépések olyan sorozatokat alkotnak, amikből a legjobb játékosok sokat megtanulnak alkalmazni, miáltal növekszik a győzelmi esélyük. Ha valaki egész életében csak ezzel foglalkozna, akkor sem érne a játék lehetőségeinek határára. Különlegessége az is, hogy előnyadásos rendszerével két eltérő tudásszintű játékos is tud egymással érdekes játszmát játszani.

This is the perfect game.  I've been playing about a year now, mostly on littlegolem.  I'm certainly not very good, but I'm getting better with each play.  Mostly I love the depth and simplicity.  I'm not always in the mood to play and find some other games more fun.  I can't find anyone to teach this to who will sit and play with me, but I'm content playing online for now.  This will likely have more longevity and retain my respect more than any other game.  I plan to play this one forever.

Despite my reservations against 2p combinatorial abstracts, Go is the deepest and most elegant of its kind (perhaps of all games). It contains fuzzy positional judgement, non-local effects, pattern recognition, long term consequences and strategy in a genre usually about tactics and lookahead. This allows intuitive play by humans to succeed spectacularly against brute force AI calculation.

Go even inspired a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory]new area of mathematics[/url].

The thing I enjoy most about Go is its depth, having survived intense scrutiny by dedicated players and organisations around the world over thousands of years. I can keep learning significant new things, discovering how to get better, and making progress. Despite a dozen books, hundreds of games, and many tangible improvements to my game, I'm still baffled by "obvious" moves.

I also enjoy the indirectness of the game: assaulting from a distance and defending by making contact, attacking to profit rather than kill, giving up territory for "influence", nurturing the opportunities to make threats, ensuring your formations have "good shape".

I can't really find anyone to play this with, at least at a level at which I can really learn, but I love pulling out the set with my kids and showing them bits of strategy I have read while they attempt to surround my armies. I am still playing on an old inherited travel board that was given to my family when I was a child by friends who were moving on to a better quality board. That was over thirty years ago and I'm still working on figuring out the game.

RATING: N/A
The king of deep abstract games, a nice set of Go also goes well on a coffee table. It's aged much better than chess for me, probably because memorizing games doesn't do quite as much in Go as it does in chess. The kind of game you'd set up, play a bit, leave, then return to later. * Rated as a 'tweener because I know I'd dive into it if I could spare the time, but I can't so it doesn't get played. Someday, someday. * Removed my rating.

After close to 40 games I can safely say that I still haven't even scratched the surface of the possibilities in Go.  It's the quintessential "lifestyle game" -- requiring a lifetime of study and play and easily supporting it.

This is obviously a classic. I wish I could love it. It is simple to learn, but would take a life-time to master. The Each turn you simply place a stone on the board.

It takes a while to get over the initial learning curve, but the depth and beauty of this 2-player strategy game can't be beat.

Seemingly simplistic, but, in reality,  hugely strategic and difficult to master. Go, aka Wei'chi, is probably the strategy purists preferred game. Finding an opponent may be a problem if you live in the West though!  Also the complicated scoring and determining who has actually won, may prove an insurmountable obstacle for many casual players.  There is a superb game in here, but it's not for the faint hearted.

The board (a quality wooden Go-ban will add to your enjoyment) and stones may be used for the simpler, but still enjoyable, game of Go-maku.

One of the skills all samurai were expected to cultivate, Go is one of the best 2 player strategy games. Very easy to learn, but complex enough to suit many levels of play. The nature of the board also means that you can use a limited area for faster games - I personally tend to play 11 by 11 rather than the full sized 19 by 19. Due to its popularity it&#039;s also very easy to find opponents on the internet.
The only real problem I have is that due its highly cerebal nature it&#039;s not the kind of thing you can whip out at parties. Especially at the more casual levels a small difference in ability will lead to a huge difference in score, and the lack of any element of chance means the contests can become very one-sided.

GO! THE GAME!

RATING: 10
Pretty much the ultimate in games; to me, Go transcends every other game out there. Just three simple rules, but there has likely never been the same game played twice. 

I [edit:was] -am- about shodan level (AGA; 1-2k KGS) and just barely scratching the surface. Like Chess, Go is more than a game you buy, play, and shelve--it is a dream of better play, a pursuit of just one more insightful move. If you can stick with it, I cannot recommend Go enough.

First, Go is the epitome in elegance: very simple rules and components but extraordinary depth.  However, 19x19 games take too long and just don't hold my attention.

RATING: 9
Along with Chess, the best classic abstract, brain melting game on the planet. After having read Sun Tzu's Art of War in college, I had to investigate 'Go'. It remains an enigma to me, as it's much more difficult to plan out a strategy than it is in games like Chess. However, it is fascinating. If one has any interest in military history, or theory, then it's worth checking out, since it's all about surrounding & capturing territory (and pieces), while using the fewest pieces to do so. 

Not to compare, but one can get a good grip on Chess after playing for a few years, but with 'Go', it could take a lifetime. The mechanics are very simple to teach but the strategy that unfolds can be mind boggling- but in a good & interesting way. It's also a site to see a Go board filled with black & white pieces vying for control of space.

It takes a lot for me to give a game (or anything for that matter) a 10/10.  Go is simply an amazing game.  The amount of depth that the game offers is unparalleled by any other game I have ever played.  The game certainly isn't for everyone, but those who play it all agree that it is a phenomenal game.  Also, if you play on a nice board, the game is visually stunning.

Ok, come on here people this is an old game which is so simplistic it's not much fun even though it does provide an interesting tactical challenge.  The game is so simple though that it never really changes, games will never be drastically different, lines will be built till somebody breaks through.  That's the game, over and over and over again.

There are 4 things I look at when I rank a game and the game of Go is king on 3 of the 4 standards.  These 4 things are:

1.  More strategy and less luck - Go had no luck involved.

2.  Not easily mastered - After playing even the most complicated games serveral times, you start to get a hang on what you need to do in the game to win.  After that time comes, the game can start to get boring and you you move onto other games.  The more I play Go, the more I realize how far I have to go before mastering the game so it never gets boring and I am always challenged.  This is a game I will be playing when I am old and in a wheelchair and there are not many games I can say that about.

3.  History - There is not a game with more history than this one.  There are books written about its history.

4.  Good Theme - This is one catagory that Go does not have and the only reason it is not a 10 in my ranking.

Started playing in early 2007. My desert island game. Reaching 1 dan is a life ambition (I'm stuck on about 7 kyu at the moment). No other game has triggered a life ambition in me.

I used to love doing (and creating) abstract puzzles as a kid, and that desire for intellectual challenge is fulfilled in adulthood by go. I love how much of a role intuition plays.

Aesthetics are important to me in a game, and this one has the purest. It also has a ridiculously simple ruleset with deliciously complex consequences. With its lessons of balance, shape, initiative, sacrifice, and so on, this is the only game where I feel like getting better at it will actually make me a better person.

A life entirely devoted to this one game, and nothing else, would not be wasted.

Gosh, I wish I had someone who loved this game like I do.  I don't like to play against a computer, and it's a game I think you need to grow with someone together.

This makes chess look like a "Fisher Price" toy (no offence).  Go is quite simply everything that is elegant in gaming.  The shape, texture and even the tempurature of the stones emit the complexity of this game.  It is stimulating and horrifically complex in it's simplicity.  BUY IT, play it, you will be amazed at how great an experience it is.  Get a version with the glass or stone peices and don't settle for the "13" line board... go for the original "19" the space is needed.

I don't want to burn down chess, chess is one of the great abstract games too, but with Go you have a lot more of variations (due to the greater size of the board) AND with Go you can play with handicap in order to have an "even" game between a weaker and stronger player.
I play a lot of abstract games on IYT, but until now most abstract games lack the richness in aspects you have to deal with. Chess is good second best, but the board itself is to cramped ;)

2006 Four years later, I've started getting back into Go.  Played a few games against the computer and enojoyed it.  Started reading my Go books again, and am planning on attending a local club.

I used to love playing Go and went to lots of tournaments.  But, after studying the game for three years it suddenly stopped being fun and I haven't played for years.

I'm a dreadful player myself, but I've played against enough games against an amateur dan player to appreciate the depth of the game. I suppose it ought to be good, if it's been around this long. I feel like I need to give a 10 to something, to establish the upper end of the game scale, and couldn't think of a better alternative.

As a life-long chess player, I'm fascinated by Go's ability to be simultaneously simpler, and more complex than Chess. In Chess, the goal is to kill the opposing king at all costs. In Go, the goal is to maximize your liberty, and warriors lost are counted against you. In Chess, pawns are inconsequential at the end of the game. In Go, every unit counts. Chess is small enough to be nearly solvable by modern computers. In Go, the problem set is so much larger that Go AI projects have much more catching up to do. 

Looking at the differences between Chess and Go sortof represent the differences between stereotypes of Western and Eastern thinking to me.

And for that, I find it fascinating.

RATING: 5
This is a difficult game to rate because I know if it was the only game I ever played, I would probably really like it.  However, Go just isn't very much fun for the amount of time you have to put into it to really learn how to play the game well.  It suffers the same problem as chess in that a newbie will nearly always lose to an expert, meaning that it isn't a game you can just pull out once in a while or play with random people.  Maybe in a city with a big Go club or something I would get into this game.  It basically mirrors my thoughts on chess, only Go has even less theme and it even more difficult for a new player to get into.  If I was rating the game purely on its design or its appeal, perhaps it would be an 8 or 9, but since the rating is supposed to be a subjective judgment on how much I like a game and how likely I am to play it, Go gets a 5, and thats pretty generous.

There are a number of eurogames out there with go-like elements and playstyles.  I recommend through the desert.

Oh boy, a 2-player abstract. Arguably the best one? Also, one that no one knows how to play. See also, XiangQi. It is at least easier to teach than Chess or XiangQi, but it also has an even GREATER range of skill levels, making finding a suitable opponent (heck, ANY opponent) nigh-impossible. I sort of know how to play, but not how to play well. Not a ton of desire to study.

Not trying to look smart, and I'm not good at it, either.

But the combination of simplicity and complexity, strategy and intuition, and 3000 years of elegance condensed into a board with black and white pieces seems impossible to beat.

Different board size options (9x9/13x13) allow for shorter games, and bonus pieces let players of different strengths join for a game.

I want to love Go, not just admire it.  

Partly to blame was the anime Hikaru no go series, and partly because it's one of the few games that actually gets played in South Africa at a club level.

But for that I'd need to dedicate too much time that I could spend on other games, and also with more friends at a time.

One day I may sit down and study this thing properly. But chances are I won't.

My father taught me Go at an early age. Even with a nine-stone handicap, he would trounce me. Although it is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most significant games ever, it doesn't "do it" for me in terms of board gaming fun. It is up there with Chess, Shogi, Backgammon, and other "classic" games, but all require substantial study, time, effort, practice, and many, many plays to become really good. I guess I play board games to have fun in terms of social interaction. Go is more like a wrestling match--kill or be killed; it's exhausting. I only comment on it, due to its nostalgia factor.

I finally sat down to try and learn the rules of Go and boy am I impressed. I have been playing with various AI's since then and even have a couple of DragonGoServer games going. Might try to find the time for a game on IGS or KGS sometime. Very, very deep game that is just beautiful. Highly doubt that I'll ever get much tracking with it at home, but at least there are plenty of online resources!

Go has probably the highest difficulty:complexity ratio of any game.  The rules can be learnt in seconds, but it is as difficult to master as chess.  However, playing Go can be strangely therapeutic.  It is also the only game I have ever played where it can be difficult to know whether you have reached the end or not - a problem exacerbated when playing against computer opponents.  Plus, I love the fact that humans have been unable to write a computer program capable of defeating a good human player.

Once you have entered the game, you will feel enchanted and captivated by the brilliant stones and the wood.

The rules is simple, elegant yet it is really complex. That's why it is always a challenge to play a game of GO to find out what is our inner strength.

Highly recommend this beautiful and wonderful game to all people regardless of age and race.

I was taught to play Go by my older brother when I was in primary school. We drew the board in pen and then "placed stones" by using a pencil to mark an intersection with an X or O. Without a doubt it is the best game you can play with just a pen, pencil, paper, and eraser.

If Chess is the game for eccentric eggheads, then Go is a game for charmless weirdos, who lack the kind of social skills that even Eurogamers can manage. I briefly tried playing this at university, but quickly tired of being patronised by the regular players, who were invariably very good. It can be handicapped, but even 9 stones doesn't make up the difference between a good player and a novice. Easily the deepest game on the planet, but to play at a high level I'd have to abandon every other game and just play this. Sorry, but life's too short.

I consider Go to be the perfect board game.

Go is zero luck, 100% strategy. It is a genius level of complexity distilled into something you can learn to play in ten minutes and spend 60 years perfecting.

Go is a game about life and death. The primary goal is to gain points by placing stones of your color on a large grid to surround empty regions of the board. However if either you or your opponent surround the other, those person's stones die and are removed permanently from the game. The entire rich complexity comes from both players trying to surround empty spaces while ensuring their own pieces are not surrounded by their opponent. It's deep, rich, and my all time favorite board game.

Spent a year studying and playing Go. Memorized multiple games, got to know the openings, the end game.

Sheesh. What a lot of effort for so little payoff in enjoyment. 

Abstract, no theme, can't play multiple players. Endgame is so boring that part of learning the game is learning the shorthand to avoid playing the endgame out.

But while chess can largely be considered an entirely pre-computed problem with just a decision tree much like tic-tac-toe is now, Bobby Fisher can still beat a computer at playing Go, raising this to a 3.

Mar 08: Man, now that's an abstract (in a good way).  It's actually rather hard to pick up just from a rule book.  The rules only define the boundaries, filling in the moves really takes some practice.

For the moment, I'm just playing a 9x9 board with my wife.  We both enjoy it that way and we might actually learn something over time.

I'd warn you not to compare this to checkers or chess, Go is a very different animal.  Much more organic and open ended.  Much more my style.

Only 1 play of Atari Go and now I'm sure of what I expected before the game.  This is the type of the game NOT for me.  I'm not fascinated by the gameplay or the type of challenge it presents.  

Additionally - the game is very deep and I don't intend to sacrifice my life or considerable part of it to Go.  And sporadic or occasional playing of Go is not what this game is all about.
  Personally, I prefer variety than dedicating my life to 1 game or activity.  And without any guarantee to become (really) good at it.  PASS, thank you.

Funny thing is that the explanation of this supposedly 'simple' game with '2 rules' took 2 explainers and 25 instead of 5 minutes.  There _are_ some nuances to explain and even now I cannot say I fully understand all the rules...  Annoying :-//

This is probably one of the best abstract games ever and even though it runs a little long for what it is, the play moves quickly. Strategies can be hard to grasp at first and even after 10 games. I got beat several times and still get beat by good players, frustrating and challenging, needs a lot more plays.

[u]UPDATE:[/u]Damn this game. I read the rules AGAIN and have played again and I still don't fully grasp all the strategy in this game, one of the deepest games I have played for sure and maybe period. 9 x 9 grid doesn't take too long versus the bigger one, especially if you get beat on. More plays and strategy articles are in order for this, I really need someone to teach me FTF then I know I will catch on to the deeper subtleties...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Okay, thanks to a friend [i]trying[/i] to explain things (he is Chinese so things were getting lost in translation...) but mostly thanks to my new Android phone, I finally feel like I can play a pretty good/competent game of this (the phone program is awesome because it shows you territory control after every move which is a HUGE help for learning and playing).

It really is not that hard to grasp and the rules are ridiculously simple, yet if you are not taught properly in the beginning or try to teach yourself online you will likely be lost (didn't help me that I was likely switching to Chinese rules some games without knowing...DOH!)  

The game is a marvel of design truly in that such simplicity breeds such depth, a beauty to behold and will likely become a 9.5 or even 10 for me. I am not fully convinced yet that it has tons of different strategies to explore (of course I 'think' [never researched it myself just heard] that is pretty much a well known fact and don't doubt it, I just want to see some of them for myself) but then I am only 40 games in at this point. It just seems many of my games are taking on the same patterns time and again and I'm not sure I see that part of it changing. This is not to say I am a good player and have it all figured out, far from it. Pattern recongnition is not a big strength for me and I know my game needs tons of improvement, the AI still kicks my butt most times and only on level 5 out of 10, its not hard to see once you grasp the basics and know your way around why this is called a lifetime game, its incredibly deep and just plain tricky to "see" the true meaning (ramifications) of a single stone placement most times. Of course too, thinking about it more, I am truly playing mostly tactically and I probably need someone to show me a few strategy tips and playing a different person might really shake things up too (or just play more in general, the slower more painful way...) 

Anyway the game is a war, a brutal war of territory and a knife fight in an alleyway, the true Grandaddy of all Area Control games and the purest game I have ever played. If you have played Through the Desert the Euro game 2 player, this really is of a similiar flavour and you shouldn't be scared of it, the board is just much harder to "SEE" but it comes. The "EYE" rule was one of my stumbling blocks, once I fully "got it" (and its really simple) the rest just fell into place, again had someone taught me from the beginning things would have been SO much better for me than trying to learn on my own.  

At any rate I have a new love, I am not about to marry it and devote my life to it but when I can play an easy game against the AI on my phone in 20 - 30 minutes (13 x 13) it sure is a satisfying experience and I am thoroughly hooked at the moment. Now the next time my friend comes to visit I have a little 'surprise' waiting for him....  *-)  

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Okay, I have played another 20 games up to 60 now and while I have seen some good improvements in my play, I think its time I stop playing against a computer who can quickly calculate which of 100+ moves is the best before I throw my new phone against the wall. Increasingly frustrating yet so rewarding at times too. It also might seem that I am too aggressive at times, playing more offensive than defensive and I let certain "moves" bother me and will counter_counter_counter kinda cut off my nose to spite my face in a way and that likely loses me ground....

It seems I am at a plateau now and in order to improve further I will really have to do a little reading (or have someone teach me a couple of tricks). Due to the need for this, I'm not sure I can give the game a 10 but that only is the only thing stopping me otherwise this is THE abstract game. Let's see what happens from here.

I've played more games against an AI than I can count...  I *really* want to play this face-to-face.

Learning the rules was a bit confusing at first (how do freedoms/liberties work again? how do you score?) but after playing a few practice games, the rules just seemed to click...  And that is one of the biggest reasons I like the game: the clicks.  Playing a game of Go is a learning experience.  It seems every few games, I learn something new or I think I see some pattern.  I have a feeling this is due to game play being so instructive: over time you can more easily see when you made a "bad" move (or series of moves).

The game can easily be played by people with different skill levels through an excellent handicap system and end scoring mechanism.  Also, game time can be modified easily by changing the size of the board.

I wish more people played this over chess.

I'm not a big fan of abstracts but from what I've played so far I can see why it's so popular. I have little skill or knowledge about the strategies so I'll get whooped every time. Like Chess, the more you read/are taught about the game the better you'll be.  I just hate that you can read one or two books about the game and make yourself a noob killer without having ever played a single game.

== Simple definition.
Go is a perfect information, 2-player, abstract, area control game.

== More accurate definition.
Go is an insidiously addictive way of life, where the more you play the more often you find yourself working out "just one more puzzle" at 2:00 AM.

During the game, players try to surround more territory than their opponent. Captured stones, those which have no empty points adjacent to them or their group, count against your score.  Play continues until both players pass in succession.  Normal games are played on a 19x19 grid, but beginners typically use a smaller board.

Go is wildly popular in Korea, China, and Japan. You can watch professional matches, complete with color commentary, on TV in these countries.  In the U.S. we have to be content with reading reviews and replays of professional matches.


== What I like the most.

* Games between players of differing skills are still fun. Go has a built-in handicap system that works extremely well. The weaker player (always playing black) gets to place a number of stones on the board prior to the game. It's common to refer to one player as being "3 stones stronger" than another, for example.

* A Go game is a "conversation" between players that is spoken with the stones.  As you carve up the board, laying claim to "your" territory, there's a balance that must be maintained. You only need to win by 1 point (actually 0.5), and trying to win in a landslide is usually a strategic mistake that will backfire horribly.  Simply knowing who is ahead in territory during the game is difficult. "Counting" is the practice of figuring out who is ahead, which determines the basic strategy that must be taken.  If you're ahead, you want to end the game with simple moves.  If you're behind, you need to make something happen and act more aggressively.  If you're ahead, but you behave like you're behind, then you're more apt to make mistakes and fall victim to a counterattack.

* Go is aesthetically pleasing.  The board, the stones, the bowls, the sound of a piece being played, the look of the board as a game progresses -- all of these add up to a game that is austere yet gratifying to the senses. This balances nicely with the mental taxation of playing the game itself.

* Improving in skill is fun. It's said that to improve you need to do three main things: (1) play a lot, (2) review your games, and (3) study life-and-death puzzles. Obviously, I enjoy playing the game. I try to review all of my games, and usually find several glaring errors. It's especially helpful to have a stronger player review the game for you. Life-and-Death puzzles, among others, are fun little brain burners. Doing several each day makes seeing the life and/or death of a group during a game more instinctive.

* The time system. While not specific to Go, and not always used, the normal method of keeping time in a Go game is called Byo-yomi.  This is a system where there is an initial block of time and then a series of overtime periods of a certain length.  As long as you make your moves in less than the overtime duration, you will never run out of time. If you use up all of your overtime periods, you lose.

Example: Online, I typically play with 25:00 mimutes + 5x(30 seconds byo-yomi).  This means that once my 25 minutes is up, I have to make the rest of my moves in under 30 seconds each. Each time I pass over the 30 seconds, one of my 5 byo-yomi periods is used up. If I take 1:01 to make a move, then I lose two byo-yomi periods, etc. 


* No opening book moves. Not exactly anyway (certainly nothing to the degree of Chess). There are key strategic opening principles, although applying them correctly is a difficult task. There are also localized series of moves called "josekis." These are moves which result in a roughly equal outcome for both sides. Like book moves in Chess, these require both memorization and a deeper understanding of what's going on behind the moves so that varations don't wreck your game.

The conventional wisdom is that you should not spend a lot of time memorizing josekis, as it will actually make you a weaker player, until you're already strong enough to understand why the moves are joseki in the first place. It's OK to learn some josekis, but usually you want to do this in reaction to a position that happened in a game.  For example, if you keep losing your entire corner to an invasion on the 3-3 point versus your 4-4 point stone, you should take 15 minutes to review the basic josekis of this position and figure out where you're going wrong.


* The balance between strategy and tactics. These are highly intertwined in Go. It's easy to get caught up in the mentality of, "I must destroy my opponent's stones!" This is usually an error, however, and generally difficult to accomplish anyway. A better approach is, "I will threaten to destroy my opponents stones, but as he defends against it I'll gain territory or influence instead."  Attack for a reason, and not just because blowing up stones is fun (which it is). 

Given that you are attacking for a reason, which is typically strategic in nature, you still have to carry out the attack, which is generally tactical. How you conduct an attack, or a defense, can have an enormous impact on your overall strategy.



== Reference material

Go is a "lifetime" game which rewards study, practice, and creativity. 

There are also plenty of books to read for all skill levels, and other forms of instruction.  While harder to find in the U.S. than in Asia, there are still plenty of English language resources available.  Thanks to the Internet, those of us in the western world have access to a good selection of Go info.

* [url=http://senseis.xmp.net/]Sensei's Library[/url]: The English Go wiki.  Start with their introduction and beginner pages.

* [url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?LearnToPlayGoSeries]The Janice Kim Books[/url]: A series of introductory Go topics. Very readable, and well written. They'll get through the very basics of the game.

* [url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheSecondBookOfGo]The Second Book of Go[/url]: (The first book being the rules.) This is an overview of major areas of study.  It does not go in depth on any topic, but it goes deep enough.  A friend gave me his copy after I started playing, and it helped immensely. It fits nicely with the Kim books, especially if you've worked through the first two or three of hers already.

* [url=http://internetgoschool.com/audio.vhtml]Guo Juan's Audio Go Lectures[/url]: This is a series of lectures by [url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?GuoJuan]Guo Juan[/url] and other professionals who work with her on the project. The lessons are presented as a Go board with an audio track. Each lesson costs 1 euro and is available for 1 month after purchase. (Think of it like a 1 month rental.)  There is a [url=http://internetgoschool.com/studyguide.vhtml]study guide[/url] which will give you a track of lessons to work on. She definitely does not want people blowing through these lessons as fast as possible.  The intention is that you'll watch one several times over the course of a few weeks, and also play a lot of games during this time as well.

* Guo Juan also has [url=http://internetgoschool.com/groupclasses.vhtml]online group classes[/url] that run a few times per year. 135 Euro is real money, but for 8 weeks of lessons it's a bargain. I've attended several terms of her class over the years, and it's great. The only reason that I haven't done it more is that the U.S. and European students are placed together, which makes it challenging to find common times for class games.

* [url=http://ayd.yunguseng.com/]American Yunguseng Dojang (AYD)[/url] I'm currently a member of AYD. In-seong Hwang runs this school in parallel with his larger European school. He's an 8-dan amateur who was previously in the Korean pro school. He's also the official go instructor for Switzerland and France. I attended his lectures at the 2015 U.S. Go Congress and was blown away at the clarity and practicality of his lectures. Every evening after one of his lectures the playing room was buzzing about the techniques that he had demonstrated. Almost everything seemed like it could be applied in your very next game. At $330 per 3-month season, it's a serious investment, but I have not regretted it for a second.

The general class format is 1 lecture per week (most weeks), and 1 class game per week with an extra weekend game thrown in once per month. Most games are reviewed the same night they are played, with the rest coming within a week or two. All reviews are in video format. He will teach to your level, but will not pull punches. The goal is improvement, not inflating your ego. If you make a good move, he tells you. If you make a bad move, he tells you. If you make a terrible move that someone at your level has no business ever making, he lets you have it [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGKdle1bbvo]and you feel shame.[/url] The class is a joy. The other players are great, and the school is strong as hell.

== Learning to play

I've noticed a pattern from people who tell me that they hate Go. They all tried their first game on a 19x19 board with an impatient teacher. This is recipe for pure hatred, because the game will make zero sense. There is no reason at all to play on a full sized board at first. 

Start on a 9x9 board with a 4 or 5 stone handicap against someone who knows what he's doing, or against a program like [url=http://www.sente.ch/software/goban/]Goban[/url].

Don't worry about losing. It's going to happen a lot. You'll probably find that you're making the same tactical errors often. That's OK too. The learning curve on this game is steep. When you start out at a rank of 30-kyu, the road to 1-dan (a.k.a. shodan) is a long one. (I'm sitting at 4-kyu on KGS after ~1000 games. This is likely on the slow side, as there are people who have made 1-dan in fewer games. Take it as a rough value. I'm stubborn with my bad habits, so 1-dan is going to be a longer road for me.) Even though most players will never reach shodan, that rank doesn't mean "expert." It means that you know the basics and now you're ready to start learning how to play the game for real. Obviously the word "basic" takes on a whole new meaning in a game of this depth.


== Instruction

You've played your first 100 games and have some small clue of what's going on. The best way to improve is to have an instructor and review your games. There are several levels to this.

RATING: 10
I picked up a small, folding goban in a thrift store, and that was enough to trigger an obsession. I have had a version of the game on my computer for quite some time, but being able to play on a physical board significantly heightened my interest. I like deep abstracts, and for some reason Go has clicked with me to a degree that Chess never did.

Bonus: My wife likes it too, and the handicap system should enable us to play one another even if my typical obsessive study causes me to progress faster than her. (Or if her intuition causes her to progress faster than me - she killed me at our first game.)

Now we have a nice go board and stones that we picked up for our fifth anniversary. I anticipate a lot of play in the future.

Also, go is hard.

An update: I have played go a lot in the last few years (hundreds of games if I were to count online play), and it is easily my favorite game. I haven't played as many games with my wife as I had hoped; when I began to study the game in earnest she lost interest; the handicap system can only be stretched so far.

In terms of strategy and design, this game is a 10 in my mind, but I'm not driven to play it much on the whole. I'd love to play it more, but it does not light up anyone around me.

One thing to love: a built in handicapping system. Fantastic!

Go: a minute to learn, years of ass whooping. I like a challenge, but in this game my butt whooping isn't a challenge, it's a given! :laugh:

This game is a 10 in design, but I don't hanker to play all the time. It can be dry, it isn't for everyone, but it's a classic.

I am getting marginally better in getting wiped. I was given some fantastic books as a gift  (Learn to Play Go: A Master's Guide to the Ultimate Game (Volume I-V) by Janice Kim) and I strongly recommend them. Very good gift for a game I've been interested in since I was young. Maybe someday I'll play face to face with my gifter!

I can not get this game to the table "in house" so-to-speak, but I would love to. This is a brain burner for me in all senses.

I do like chess, I can even get chess played on my own table now-and-again, chess is a very good one, but it doesn't stay on my mind and I don't own a chess book yet (though I should)...

I bought a set of Go stones from Yunnan, China at the end of 2008. It was supplied with a plastic 'board' and well, no containers. The stones now sit in plastic jars (formerly used for cookies). Had my first play this year (2012) and found the game quite intriguing with its many possibilities and 'zen'-like feel of the game board growing as the black and white stones are placed, flowering and blossoming like springtime (not that I know what spring actually feels like, tropical climate and all).

I haven't played it enough to decide if I should invest in a 'proper' board yet.

So simple. So deep. It just works.
I've played this game my whole life and still know nothing. A game feels more like a martial arts battle than recreation. Such an amazing experience, it's an honor to lose. I dream of Go, it's almost a Platonic ideal. So far no new game I've tried has surpassed it in depth nor nuance nor immersive experience. It's spoiled me, frankly. 
Because it's a game built on thoughtfulness, I resent bggers who treat games with AP like a sin. 
Like a true devotee, I also think it mimics and develops the virtues needed in business and war more than any other game.

Kicks Chess's butt in the strategy department.  If you're just starting out, don't even THINK about playing on a full-sized board.  Your brain WILL explode.  Start with a 9x9 and work your way up from there.  Yes, the learning curve is steeper than almost every game out there.  It is worth it.

This game is really deep, and quite unlike the game it's normally compared to: chess. Yet, although patterns are very important in this game, there is still a much deeper degree of straight up move by move reasoning.

The thing that makes Go so good is it's elegance, and it's natural focus on personal improvement as opposed to simply playing to win. This used to be my favourite game (the only game I rated a 10) however, I now find it too stressfull to play, but I still highly recommend it

The board consists of a 19x19 grid. There are stones in 2 colors - 181 black stones and 180 white stones. Players take turns placing stones at intersections on the grid in an attempt to surround and capture opposing stones and wall off "territories" on the board that score at the game's end. Because you are always trying to capture stones and secure key points on the board to define your territories - and trying to prevent your opponent from doing the same - there is a fine degree of both offensive and defensive thinking that is needed on every turn. As stone placement flows across the large grid an impressive variety of situations develop. Not only do you have to think both offensively and defensively, you have to react tactically and plan strategically as well. The capture element is fought in localized situations that develop, while you always have in the back of your mind ways to secure territories for the game's end. A rich and rewarding game.

Unfortunately a steep learning curve, with a high amount of variation in player skills. It's very difficult to find people at an appropriate skill level to match yourself, and the handicap system is elegant and works fine but is rather unsatisfying.

But the game itself is so deep and wonderful, it remains tops despite any flaws.

I'm not sure what I could say about Go that would be worthwhile. 

Yes, it's frighteningly deep. It's also not that hard to learn and can be engaging and enjoyable even when you're being trounced. The concepts at work are fascinating, even if they're difficult to master. 

Honestly if you like games and someone is willing to teach you, give it a shot. Why not, right? Even if it ends up being too much of a commitment to sink more playtime into, you'll be glad you took a look at at it.

I'm glad that this game is at least in the top 100 considering it's an abstract game (which don't get much love).  It should be top 10 considering its the most played game.
I think that this is the best strategy game of all time.  

It has a great amount of depth and keeps me interesting and reading about strategy.  I find it more fun to play than chess.
This game rewards the skill of the player more than most games on this list, so will put a lot of people off.

It keeps teaching me about how I should play other games.  The most impotent lesson that I have learned is that theme doesn't matter.  What matters is how the game plays.  That is what will keep you coming back for more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best strategy game of them all. This is the only game that I have wanted to study to more depth than any other. It is amazing considering how simple the rules are.  The strategy and depth is staggering. No other game can't compete.  This game proves that theme and mechanics really aren't always that impotent to a great strategy game.  If you invest time into this game, you will learn also more deeply about yourself and life.  Only 3 problems with this game;
 1. None of the board gamers I know play or want to play (not trendy I guess).
 2. You have to learn some basic strategy or you won't get far.  This normally means reading at least one book.  
 3. it is an abstract and puts people off.  For example the dice tower never mention abstract games in there top 10 lists.
These are not problems for me, so it gets a 10. This games is number one on my list.

There's nothing "wrong" with Go. It's a game that delivers based on the effort the players are willing to invest. If I spent a few weeks playing Go everyday, I think I'd grow to love this game. As it is, I'm not at a point in my life to make that investment.

Go is an amazing game: any way you look at it, the games rules are simple, and can be taught in a minute.  But that's where it starts.

The game's depth is expressed in its persistent existence of 4000 years.

People say, I'd rather not devote my time to just one game, but many, that's why I don't play GO (or Advanced Squad leader for example), but if that game is superior, and has an actual lasting quality, then I say "WHY NOT!"  By no means am I saying this is the only game I'm going to play, but I am saying 40 years down the road, of my current games collection, this will probably be one of the few played due to its sustainability of depth and simplicity (and poor vision and arthritis).

Plus, wouldn't it be cool to be able to say "I'm a 4th Dan."  Yes, this game has actual ranks.

I will never be good at Go. I will never be mediocre at Go. I can play it, I can hold my own against a very weak opponent, but beyond that - I just have to accept that it is not something I have the time to master.

Aside from that - this should rank as the greatest abstract game of all time. Far more elegant than chess, in the simplicity of its rules, yet quite a bit deeper in terms of the brain-power required to succeed. One of the few games, along with chess and perhaps Cathedral, for which owning an expensive set is worthwhile, for the artistic value alone even if never played.

RATING: 9
From the claustrophobic chess out to the open fields of Go. Yes, it's more like a philosophical approach to strategy than a game.

I like it more than Chess, because it has more room for intuition and it's not just an exercise in memorizing several moves ahead.

A problem though for an amateur, like me, is the quite complex evaluation of points.

Why I like Go:
-Simple Rules, can be explained in under a minute
-Good Replayability- this won't be a game you play a couple times and never touch again, unless the game doesn't turn out to be your cup of tea, you will find yourself taking this game out of its box every once in a while.
-Packed with Decisions- this game will have you constantly analyzing the board and trying to come up with the right move
-Versatile Equipment-the go set can be used for multiple different games, such as my favorite, Connect6.
-Elegant- hard to explain but after playing most would agree with me

Verdict:
Definitely worth trying out on a free app/website. And if you like it, I would recommend buying the physical version as you can play other games on a Go set and because of the enhanced experience of playing in real life.

RATING: 8
Pick a stone, place it and try to enclose as much territory as you can. That are the rules of Go without entering in special situations or scoring. The rules are terribly simple to teach, but this simplicity hides an incredibly complex and taxing game.

Are you looking for a brain burner? Don't mind if it's an abstract or, even more, you prefer it? Then you must play Go. Magnificent strategy game with an extremely complex structure. Once you have give it a try you might like it or not, but isn't difficult to understand why this one has been alive for so many years.

The problem with this game is the same that chess, shogi and all those classic heavy games: it has been overstudied, so if you don't find opponents of your level one player will consistently trample the other.

Fascinating abstract strategy game for two players. Simply placing stones on a board. One by one. Evolving into a display of pure elegance, amazing depth and sheer beauty. ***** The handicap stones allow opponents of unequal experience/skill to play Go in a more balanced way, which is rare for abstract games. ***** A 9x9 board is ideal to learn the look and feel of the game (Igowin), but playing on the standard 19x19 board is of course much more fun (Many Faces of Go). And nothing beats playing against real opponents! ***** After playing around with the pc games, a few sessions in the local Go club end of 2005 and reading books for more than two years, I finally joined KGS on 20th May 2008 ... and got really hooked. (Note: only KGS plays against real players are logged in my games played - not those against bots; Well, I actually played only once against a bot on KGS - why bother with bots when you can play with real people?) ***** KGS: 22/05/2008: 16kyu; 26/05/2008: 15kyu; 29/05/2008: 14kyu; 23/06/2008: 13kyu; 16/07/2008: 12kyu; 09/09/2008: 11kyu.

Not a light board game really, it does take a few hours to actually "get" that your groups die unless they have 2 real eyes, and then some practice games to see them come into being on the board. The ko rule might take 10 games to understand it. 

Played it a few times on an app or on the pc, read some books about it and played a few times with my GF. In the end I find it too intense, and playing against a better player feels like everything you do keeps you slipping off.

It is more elegant than chess or draughts (the 10x10) version in the sense that there is no "draw" (remise), and it allows for some handicap.

-1 for the learning curve
-1 for the 19x19 and 13x13 games take too long, and there is nothing to do while the opponent is pondering his move.

When I really begin to dig into this game, I expect that it may surpass chess in its intrigue, organic beauty, and cosmic significance. A case has been made that this game actually facilitates the evolution of human consciousness, and I see this to be likely. A culture that plays Go is truly a culture to be respected. The game appears sublime in its capacity to embody certain characteristics, patterns, or truths of the universe, while being both infinite in scope and deeply enriching to those who embrace it. To excel at Go requires one to throw off the confines of desire and ego, to exist in a state of mental and spiritual balance and harmony. Go is therefore more than a game—it is a life teacher, ineffable in the rich and rewarding depths that spring from its simplest essence—and as a board game, it appears singular in its tendency to guide players along paths to awareness and understanding.

A venerable abstract strategy game, with such depth and complexity that it is daunting. The simplicity of the rules, together with the amazing range of strategic depth, make this game almost a perfect abstract strategy game. It can be played on varying sized boards for varying challenges, from a 7x7 board for a quick tactical game to a 19x19 board for an hours long strategic game, with plenty of tactical conflicts during the course of the game.

Played twice.  How does one rate this game after only two games?  Well, I see the brilliance of the strategy, and I feel the dearth of fun.  I'm probably not the only one who has felt that it takes a single game to know the rules, a dozen games to know what you're doing, a hundred games to feel competitive and a thousand games to have fun.  I don't think I'll ever have that kind of time to devote to a single game.

The definitive CLASSIC of all board games and probably the oldest in human history.  Too bad I don't have enough time to master this beauty... fairly simple to learn, nuances takes some time to understand.  Go is superbly elegant and a lifetime to master and twice as difficult as western chess.   (My rating on this, is an exception to the general rule, and based on what "I think" of the game rather than "how often" I'm in the mood to play it.  It's way too complex for me to master (Go masters can beat AI Go programs b/c there's too many computations to calculate using modern computers) and I wouldn't be able to play it frequent enough to get good at it.)

I used to have dreams about this game.  You couldn't imagine a simpler game -- all of its rules could be written on a 3 x 5 index card.  You also couldn't imagine one that's harder to master -- the best computers can't touch even a just-competent go player.  Go has a kind of flow and logic to it that Chess doesn't have, and its suprises and swings of fortune can be even more brutal.  This is one of the only games that I could see studying for the rest of my life.  I only wish I knew more people who liked it so I could play it more.

UPDATE:  10 ---> UNRATED.  My thoughts on Go's infinite depth remain unchanged.  In the years since I wrote the above, what's remarkable is not how little I've played Go, but how little I've missed it.  I recently moved somewhere that's not a mile from the local metropolitan Go center, and I haven't even brought myself to stop by.  

This is a function of my changing tastes in games.  I'm less interested in purely spacial games, and when I want to play one, I reach for a game that concludes within half an hour instead of Go's 2 - 3 hours.

I no longer kid myself that I have the inclination to study Go seriously.  And it's not a game that I fancy playing casually.  So I have consciously decided not to play Go at all.

And so here we have the dilemma of a game that I regard as infinite (suggesting a 10 rating) and yet one that I have consciously decided [b]not to play[/b] (suggesting a 1).  I don't know how to reconcile that difference.  So I will remove any rating at all.

This is the most elegant game of all time.  Only two rules, and a wealth of strategy.  They still haven't made a Go AI that can beat the world master.  This is decades after they made a chess AI that could beat the world master.  

And this is an abstract strategy game that I am frequently able to interest non-game-geeks into.  That's a lot more than I can say for many of the other great abstract strategy games.

I built a custom board made out of stone.  It's the best!  Good luck finding that anywhere on the Internet though.  That's why I made it.

Actually, here's the only reason I'm not rating Go a 10/10.  Component quality.  In most board games, there's a definite publisher, and you rate the board game as a whole experience from that publisher, including the component quality.  With Go, there's no original publisher, and a million companies make it.  

Here's the problem: none of these dim-witted companies have decided to make a Go board that is actually awesome.  Everywhere you look, it's just the same bamboo-looking thin board and plain, plain stones.  No one is selling stone Go boards.  Chess has lots of manufacturers making really great chess sets.  Go needs this.

Now, is the lack of awesome component quality due to whoever invented the game?  Clearly not.  But I am deducting that from its score nonetheless, because I believe all scores should be from the end user's perspective.

9/10.

Go is a game with very simple and elegant rules (pretty abstract though), but with dazzling depth. As a matter of fact, I didn't like my first 3 games (about ten years ago). Therefore, I didn't want to play it for more than a year after those games. After a lot of begging by a fellow go player I tried a 4th game. However, after that game I was sold. This gem is far more strategical than chess, and allows for more freedom of style. Tactics have to be embedded into a grand scheme strategy to be really effective. Opening theory is way less important than it is for chess, which I consider a huge advantage. Go also has a very sophisticated handicap system allowing for more challenging games between players of different strength.

If you're just picking up this game at the behest of someone who plays it regularly, be prepared to lose. A lot. The rules are simple, yet this game arguably offers the deepest strategy of any ever devised. Intuition and pattern recognition are key, but acquiring these is not easy as there are a LOT of patterns to recognize, and intuition must be honed through long experience. A game of Go on a full-size board can last hours. Starter boards offer faster games and slightly shallower strategy for beginners.

I'm just learning this game, and while I play it, I love it.  Still it is kind of intimidating how much I need to learn just to become passably competent, and that keeps me from rating it higher.

UPDATE: Haven't played this at all over the last couple of months.  My opinion of the game hasn't really changed, but it just hasn't occured to me to play, so I'm going to drop my rationg a point to 7.

I also love how you can give handicaps to players so (in theory) a moderately advanced player could play against a not so good player.

RATING: 10
Beautiful and tense.  Every stone placement is a subtle maneuver in an elaborate struggle.  The ultimate game, as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not that strong of a player, but you don't have to be a great player to have fun and appreciate the potential of the game.  For those out there who are intimidated by their first experience, I'd urge a few more plays to see if it clicks, preferably with another beginner who is enthusiastic about learning the game.  End-of-game plays and scoring can be somewhat intimidating for newer players, but remember the adage: "When in doubt, play it out!"  

*UPDATE 1/06*  Still a 10.  I don't really have any desire to play other abstracts.  Somewhere out there in the universe, if there is intelligent life, they are inevitably playing Go.

Go is such a beautiful and brilliant game. I have nothing but the utmost respect for it - the few full games I've had the pleasure of playing have challenged me in ways I hadn't thought possible from a board game.

But herein lies my complaint. Go is so huge and so complex that it requires an enormous time commitment. I'm talking 7-8 hours for one game. As the board becomes more populated, and piece placement carries greater consequence, you find yourself taking more and more time before placing a piece. I just don't have that kind of time to devote to a game regularly. 

So, as much as I love Go, I can only enjoy it every once in a while. And that's a shame because it takes regular practice to develop any sort of measurable skill for this game.

You place you color stone at an intersection on a board attempting to secure territory.  Also you try to surround your opponents stones to deprive them of "freedoms" and capture them.  The game is simple, like chess, but brilliant.  The only difficulty, is like chess you have to study to get better.  The game does require an immense amount of time to master.  

Every true gamer ought to have played this a few times though.

I love playing Go I'm just not that practiced. I'm currently playing 9x9 or 11x11 and very occasionally 13x13. If you pick it up understand that it's much less direct than chess, it's equal parts balance/harmony, strategy and tactics. If you are constantly attacking or defending you're going to lose big. These days I mix it up between Chess, Go, Arimaa, Backgammon, Lines of Action and Amazons.

Hardest game I ever played! Boils my brains out!

It has a somewhat steep learning curve - you can get discouraged if you start on too big a goban, and for the first few games you feel like you dont know what you are doing.

When you get to know and understand the game better, it gets really exciting, it's a tight struggle between the players from the start to the very end!

I rate the game only a 7 because of the rating explanations on BGG. Id give it at least a 9, but I cant say I'd always play the game - it takes quite long, its a two player game and it really is difficult! Playing this game can be EXHAUSTING! I need to be in a mood for an extreme mental challenge to start a game of go. :)

This game, more than any other, makes me wish more people were aware of it and that more people played it. It gets plenty of serious study, but this game is conspicuously absent when I check out my friends' board game collections. To be fair, a nice set can be cost-prohibitive, but like most board games, the grid and stones are easily repurposed for other games (see also: Gomoku, Conway's Game of Life, etc.)

Very rarely do I find someone who plays Go, and they are always utterly casual or utterly serious matches. There ought be more of a middle ground here... where is it?

My favorite abstract game.  While I just can't get into chess, I find go fascinating.

I hope my next game purchase to be one of those decently-priced but nice sets with the glass (I believe) stones that have the look and texture of real go stones.

I went through a period of a few months where I read about Go incessantly, culminating in buying a beginner's guide and getting a very nice travel set from Alysia. I'm intrigued by the fact that it seems to be the perfect abstract game (incredibly simple rules, equally difficult to master -- and lots of tough decisions), and by the way handicapping genuinely opens it up to new players being able to compete against more experienced ones.

In practice, though, it never clicked for us. I'd love to get some more Go play time, though.

"Beyond being merely a game, to enthusiasts Go can take on other

when played well, a beautiful art in which Black and White dance
across the board in delicate balance."

Insanely deep game --- both tactically and strategically --- as modern AIs have shown, despite relatively simple rules. Also playable by all ages; I am a decent club player (~1 dan level), and have played with a couple kids under 10 who are about the same ranking!

Some additional nice aspects:
1) Can scale board size (e.g. 9x9, 13x13, 19x19) depending on skill level and time constraints.
2) Very nice handicap system for matches between players of different strengths.

Only negative in my mind is that this game requires a great deal of study, and even then often makes the player feel dumb :) More seriously, this game is (excessively?) mentally draining.

RATING: 10
The game is so simple and elegant, there's just a few, straightforward mechanics - nothing extraneous at all - but emergent from this simplicity is an extremely complex, multi-level interaction on the board. Playing a lot starts to affect the way you perceive things around you, with Go-influenced patterns revealing themselves constantly. It demonstrates to me how stripped-down-to-fundamentals the game is; it's all about micro and macro-scale interactions. Reminds me of ecological processes. Very cool stuff and very mentally stimulating. I don't typically have 'favorites' - variety is the spice of life after all - but Go is one of the few instances where I could say if I had to, "This. This right here, I could have just this one game for the rest of my life and be content". Luckily, people don't put guns to your head for things like that.

Perhaps I would like Go more if I was better at it or played more often (and no doubt my skill and time spent playing are related.)

"This one goes to eleven"

Subtle, ever increasing strategy, virtually impossible for any two games to be played the same.  The range in player skill level is staggering.  The levels of strategy are like layers of quantum physics or philosophical debate.

Got into this game thanks to an University course, and got hooked. Afterwards I never understood how chess championships made it to news channels, as this game is far superior in game play. 

Haven't played it in ages, since it's so much easier to explain Yinsh or Gipf...

Besides tactics and gameplay I really like the "handicap" which makes it possible to play with stronger or weaker opponents.

RATING: 10
It's a classic, deep,abstract game of space,logistics and maneuver. Like Chess, it's as much a language as a game, and thus is best learned when very young. An interesting thing about Go to me is the way people who like it tend to take shots at Chess in comparison, while I've never heard Chess players take shots at Go. Of the two, I prefer Chess because it is less abstract and has a bit more 'personality', and I just prefer the simplicity and finality of the checkmate over Go's territory victory conditions. Both great games, and both great games to teach to kids because of the logic and spatial awareness required.

Its such a simple game yet so incredibly deep. IMO its too much of a brain workout and not enough stimulation. Too many of the games are marathon sessions of silence. However, I must say for those that feel like a great 1v1 abstract game, this is one of the all time best! I don't rate this game too high, however because with all the great games out there that can give me a good mental workout, this game just seems way too dry.

I can’t really contribute anything meaningful about Go that hasn’t been written before but this game has taken me by storm. After some dumb games against an AI on 6x6 I became intrigued - how could this simple game be so hard? Then I upped the ante and tried to play on a 9x9 board - which left me completely dumbfounded. Then I started a game on the normal sized (19x19) board and fled in horror at the wide open space before me. 

I’ve always enjoyed Chess but this is something else. This is a game that is built and shaped by the players, and so emerges vastly different every time. It offers exploration, and delightful discoveries to a degree Chess can't match. I know I'll never be good at this game but I love playing it all the same.


EDIT: A year after my flailing introduction I'm now a 1d KGS, I still don't know anything about the game though.

RATING: 9

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Control the most area on the game board by taking turns placing a black or white stones. Surrounding an opponents group takes it off the board.

Two-player only.

Pros: For a pure abstract, it's interesting how the game almost feels organic and flows so nicely. Can be played anywhere with some rocks and a graph. It's a game where maybe you can learn against a better opponent in stages by just hoping to score a few more points every game and not worry so much if you're losing a ton in the process.

Cons: It might look simple, but it's far from intuitive to understand for its intricacies. A game with this big of a following means it's going to be taken a little more serious and harder to have a 'fun' match. Experience and pattern recognition will give players a significant advantage and make it hard to find adequate opponents to keep it interesting.

Other: Ok, so I've only played this for one day and am nearly boggled by the depth of the game that I can't even see. I had fun learning and can imagine in the long run this having the potential to be rated a 10. 

Best Use: When you want a deep, deep playing experience and simplicity puts a warm fuzzy in your heart.

This game is a life saver! Having practically no social life whatever, and seeing as the friend of mine who practically lives at my house could play Monopoly on repeat from now till doomsday, I have to find a lot of solitary activities to occupy myself. Granted, Go is supposed to be 2 player. But I have never had so much fun playing any other board game, I think. I play this alone whenever I have the time, and I just love doing it. Plus, you can actually make your own set quite easily to try it, with paper (try it on a 9x9 point grid)and literally almost anything for pieces... candy, bottle caps... I used glass blobs from the craft store... ANYTHING. Then when you realize you can't live without this game, you will probably end up at Yutopian Enterprises buying their awesome plastic pieces, which I also cannot live without, and one of their cheap wooden boards, till you can work your way up to a "respectable" board with legs. Watch your pocketbooks... you can MAKE this game for next to nothing... but once you get thoroughly addicted, you can spend literally thousands of dollars getting the coveted "perfect set" of table and stones. I cannot fathom doing without this addiction! Visit Sensei's Library or some of the other cool websites out there to get yourself hooked. Just don't blame me when you start bringing your board to the breakfast table... (I did.)

RATING: 9
Although I initially gave it a 10, considering how I've decided to give ratings, basing them on considering every aspect, I have to take 1 point. 

The game is the best there is (and probably ever will be) when it comes to 2 player strategy game, it's elegant, and the contrast its simplicity makes with its depth it's fantastic. 

However, to get the most of it, you have to play it at a regular basis (unless you aquire a somewhat highish level). If you don't play for a period of time, you'll notice when you go back to it you're alamost back to square one; you won't be able to play as good and you'll remember that you were better and how it felt, and that'll probably bother you (or at least it happens to me, and I've known several people have experienced the same thing). 

Now don't get me wrong, that aspect of the game where you need to read about it and watch games to improve can actuallu be in itself a pleast experience in itself; but that means a good amount of time invested in the game, and so because you need to make such an invest to get that enjoyment I feel I can't give it a perfect score.

Every serious board game enthusiast should be at least familiar with Go. However, I understand those who don't want to start on the Go path - Go isn't a game you can really enjoy lightly, either you play it a lot or you don't play it at all.

I'm somewhere around 15 kyu right now and not really interested in getting significantly better, because that's where the effort gets too big for me - but I've spent more energy to get here than most people on Geek are probably willing to invest in one game.

Used bookstore find - a nice wooden set with slide out trays for the pieces. Still unplayed and sealed in plastic when I got it.

I've played some Go, and while I am not a huge fan of abstract brain-burners (I despise chess) I can appreciate this game for its incredible complexity, deeply rich strategy, and the extent to which, when I do play it, I am absorbed by it. Not a game I want to play every day, but when I am in the mood, I have to admit how excellent a time I have (with the right opponent.)

---------

No idea where my Go set went.

And I have recently attended a couple of Go-Club meetings, but was so utterly outclassed that it was almost an act of self-flagellation to play.

I guess here is my thinking on this: there are single books - like the Tao Te Ching, The Republic or The Symposium, Being and Time, Hamlet, The Brothers K., to name a few - that I could spend the rest of my life reading and re-reading only that one book, and be relatively happy. With each re-reading I am sure I would gain a new profound understanding, and still not plumb the depths of wisdom to be had. But why would I want to read only one book over and over for the rest of my life, when there are just so many other books to read?

And that is my feeling about Go in a nutshell. To play it the way it deserves to be played, I'd have to give up too much time and energy that I would otherwise spend playing other games. Maybe that's ok for some. But my time is limited. And I think the rich variety makes me happier.

Goodbye, Go. I think I am done with you.

---------------------------

Update: Somebody donated a cheap set to my classroom and I find myself playing this again, albeit with kids. This game is just about perfect for me if I can play it casually and not worry too much about who will win--just allow my mind to focus on the current skirmish I am involved in and be surprised by the outcome. As such, I will probably never be a very good player of this, not in the way it deserves, but I will certainly play it if offered.

I've done a few tutorials and got schooled by a snooty Go guru. There are basic principles to this game I still fail to comprehend, inhibiting my enjoyment. I have no doubt my interest will eventually increase, but for now there's just too many more appealing games.

RATING: 10
+2 has exactly 3 rules, yet is the most complex game imaginable

+2 mechanics of balance that reflect life: life and death, aggression and passivity, questions with no single answer 

+2 a meta-game that develops not from direct rules, but from the elegance of the game itself. 

+2 bustling community of avid players, and professional level play. 

-2 though the rules are very simple, as with many abstract boardgames,  the broader strategy is not accessible without a bit of work and study. 

-1 2 player only

A game that is beautiful in its simultaneous simplicity and complexity. I think every gamer should at least scratch the surface. Highly recommend Nick Sibicky (also a board game designer) and his series of Go lectures - he really brings the game to life.

What is there to say.  A classic abstract strategy game.  Deceptive in it's apparent simplicity but with enormous depth.  Beats playing chess hands down for me...
The 6 is due to the fact that I need to be in a certain kind of mood to play as I generally don't really like abstract games.  Except when I get into oriental mode after playing the L5R RPG, or watching too many animes, especially Hikaru No Go!  ;-) But still, if you like Go, watch the Hikaru No Go anime, I'm 110% sure you'll like it...  a lot...

I think I like this game? It's certainly interesting. The rule book in my copy wasn't the easiest to follow with the rules exceptions that can crop up in certain situations, but overall, Go is most definitely a game that has deep strategy with very simple rules. I guess the only thing that I can say against it is that there are so many other games that have taken what it has done, and made it more modernized. Taking turns putting out one stone is a bit dull compared to games like Through the Desert, where you're able to put down multiple camels at a time. That being said, I do think that this is a game that deserves its recognition. Despite its age, this is one of the most tense, thoughtful, and interesting games out there. I'm not sure that I want to dive in to this, but I typically dislike abstracts, and this was a fun one.

A classic game of strategy and tactics which, like chess, is best played between players of equal strength.

Go has fans because its oriental and therefore seems exotic.  The fact is the game is repetitive, slow, has an unforgivably weak set of rules, and lacks luster.  If this was, say, an early Colonial American game no one would play it.  If you insist on playing something of this sort Hex is far better.  Pay close attention to the rating graph.  It starts heading down at around seven and then has an inexplicable number of tens.  Case closed.

Go used to occupy the throne at the top of my games collection and give me hipster cred while allowing me to explain why it's oh so much better than Chess. But to me, it's actually akin to that book you never read while its presence on your shelves supposedly makes you look smart to visitors. The learning curve is extremely steep and, more than any other game, its very clean and simple ruleset does *not* make it easy to grasp, no matter how much I fantasize about how semi-competent I would get if I spent my evenings on KGS for a couple months.

Also people trying to lure people into Go tend to actively avoid talking about the final scoring phase for a while, because that part is quite daunting.

RATING: 10
Simply the best game ever!
The one I would take to the deserted island... no wait... one of its beauties is: you could easily make it out of stones and shells :-)
The rules are pure and simple and easy to teach. At the same time the game has the deepest comlexity of any game I know.
Learning it is much more about learning to get a "feel" for it in the beginning, learn to know about good shapes, build up intuition etc. not the rote learning of openings that happen very fast when getting a bit deeper into chess for example.
Another beauty of go is that it has a superb handicap system. Experienced players can play beginners and both have a challenging gaming experience.
If you like two player abstracts, and haven't had a go (pun intended) - then by any means go for it!

Simple rules, but a real brain burner.  It's easy to see why this is the ultimate classic.

I love the elegant beauty of the components and the gameplay never ceases to amaze me.  The more you play the more you realize there is to learn which always keeps the game fresh.

This game definitely replaces chess for me.  Chess just seems rather pedestrian by comparison.

The handicap system is brilliant, it keeps a new player from getting frustrated and makes the game extremely accessible.  The scalability of the differing sized boards also gives the game marvelous flexibility.

about the highest rating I give any abstract game is what this fine game deserves. Amazing and complex yet intuitively simple. This game has stood the test of time for the right reasons and rather than focusing on thinking moves ahead or examining possible moves on a Micro level like Chess does, Go forces the player to think about area control and overall influence on a macro level. The game and rules are actually less elegant than many may remember. A good game that's held up but there are simply better games even if you only count purely abstract games. It also takes too long for what it is.

Used to like this game because of the manga, and I was pretty good at my HS's Go Club (was also Vice President :D), but there's just so much to learn in Go, and it eventually just felt like one extremely long endgame and became not as fun. This is the same issue I have with Terra Mystica and Agricola, which just have a bit much in terms of information to swallow.

Fun facts: Since I was my club's VP, I couldnt participate in our tournament, but the next year, I came back as an alumni, then faced last year's winner and then last year's runner up back to back (the three of us were the best at the school at the time, and the seats werent seeded >_>) and I beat them both. It was probably my proudest moment in go. I didnt actually win the tournament though because in the finals, the other kid had to leave, and I felt like I had accomplished what I wanted (I also didnt want the starbucks gift card since I didnt drink the stuff), so we didnt play and I let him have the win.

Plays: 10 full games ish? Plus many online videos, online KGS go and some lectures on it etc

Still awed by the simple rules and deepness of strategy after years of playing. A true classic, and maybe the "best game" ever.

Unfortunately, this is not the kind of game you can dabble in... playing just once or twice a year. I've found frustration in that because I've plateaued at a certain level of mediocrity, and I know I won't get past it without some real study and commitment. 

So oddly enough while this might be my choice if I were forced to play only one game the rest of my life, I'm going to bump it down to a 9 because I find I don't relish making my moves any more on Little Golem.

This rating is based on perhaps 50 interactive games played online since 2000. For simplicity, depth, scalability and the ability to differentiate players even at the highest levels of play Go gets the highest marks. But the game takes a long time to play and one cannot finish off a very weak opponent quickly. The flavor of the game is a bit dull for my taste and though I would play it if invited, I would not seek out a game. A game similar to Go, but one which I find more interesting is Havannah.

Il più vecchio gioco della storia, regole semplici ma il gioco ha una strategia veramente complessa. Come gli scacchi o il bridge ha una profondità inimmaginabile. Niente fortuna! Tra le pecche però ci metto il fatto che sia uno scacchisitico, ovvero astratto, senza ambientazione, complesso e non tanto  divertente.

I was pleasantly surprised by this. Some of the Go rhetoric bugs me, especially when people claim it's super elegant and super simple to understand. Really it's very unique with plenty of exceptions, so it is very difficult for a beginner to wrap his mind around. But after powering through a 30-page rulebook, I got the basics down and it's quite rewarding. Still not my type of game.

After more plays, I give up. The rules are nonsensical.

Just the most amazing strategy game. I used to think Go was too deep for its own good, a rich game with a learning curve just too steep to ever get to the table or play well without an enormous amount of dedication and experience. But after I started playing a lot of Hex online, I was just swept away by the immense depth of Go. Try online-go.com

My only complaint is that i have no good real life opponents and playing online defeats the point of boardgaming being a hobby to share with friends. At the same time its difficult to excite my casual gaming friends for go. So I rarely get to play it anymore.

Outstanding game. I'll never grow tired of it.
Rules are easy - making the game very easy to play.

However, the complexity is mindblowing but you can still move along at your own pace. Not common at all with a game.

You'll relearn concepts like advantage, initiative, balance and fairness so many many times while you improve. Sure, you can get stuck not improving much, but you can still play a fun game!

I have studied and played several games, but as many others have noted, I find it dull.  Staring at a grid with black and white dots for potentially several hours can be a brutal brain drain that just is no fun.  I do enjoy abstracts from time to time, but Go is just so static in the way it plays.  I much prefer the dynamic play of something like Chess or Yinsh where pieces move.  I appreciate Go and realize the depth to complexity ratio is enormous, but it is simply a game I don't want to play.

I love games where the players are "building" something. Chess is a great, great game, but part of the reason why I prefer Go is because Chess is a game of destruction, but Go is a game of creation. The player has to balance greed and the need to take space with the need to keep groups alive. The game is very intense and has a steep learning curve. It's also longer than chess. Need to play this more.

Pros:
+Extremely simple rules.
+Very elegant.
+A TON of depth.
+Almost infinite amount of moves to make.
+Easy to handicap.
+Not just about gameplay, for me it also includes the aesthetics and feel of the board/pieces.

Cons:
-Can be hard to go easy on someone.
-Good boards are expensive.
-Has a steep learning curve which is both a positive and negative. This is more of a lifestyle game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Vastly overrated (some people see the meaning of life in this game*), to me, it's OK. One problem is the position gets so complicated after the opening moves, even for beginners playing on a 9x9 board, that you need to be some sort of Zen master to be able to read it and play it from there. So unless you're one of those Asian Go prodigies that's been raised on Go since birth, you're just guessing most of the time. I blame games like this for the phobia against deep strategic games in the boardgame fandom currently. 

It's not really a dry game, for example, Ko fights are fun, but it can get boring. Most of the time it just feels like you're placing stones on the board just to place stones on the board.

Supposedly there's some sort of elaborate scoring system to decide who won after a game's over, but all that's just smoke and mirrors. In really both players just stare at the board for awhile after their game's over and come to an agreement on who won. Unless one player gets bored before the other one and resigns. 
 
So yeah, the goal of the game is basically to come to a stalemate.

It's been fun to follow the AlphaGo games though.

*I've heard this game called a "transcendent expression of humanity" before. Maybe it's just me, but that sure is some BS.

Personally I find the game interesting and challenging. A great mental exercise. However the fun factor is low for me. It's best played against a similarly skilled opponent. I do find it more enjoyable than chess.

RATING: 9.3
Ohhh mannn... You thought chess was hard? Get on my level, punk. The basic rules are even easier than chess. You just put down a little thing on the board anywhere you want* and that's it! Of course where you put it actually matters since there are 361 distinct places to put it. 

This game is probably the hardest, most balanced game ever**. As such, it's entirely dependent on skill. If you dislike losing without being able to blame it on bad luck, then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It will crush you if you don't have a fighting spirit, and perhaps a slightly more than miniscule bit of masochism.

*Except into atari or maybe ko. It will take you roughly 200 hours of gameplay to get an intermediate understanding of ko.

**With more than 5 regular players.

RATING: 10
The perfect abstract game. Mock/Split/Flank Attack, Defence, Trap, Reconnaissance, Sacrifice, Retreat, Last Ditch Fight, Close Combat, Long Range Attack and much more is in this gem of a game. Brutal tactical possibilities, but normally the game is won by better insight in its extreme strategic deepness.

Don't become depressed when you start playing and get crushed like a hollow nut without even knowing what hit you. It takes some time to aquire the basic skills, but then Go will be fun to play no matter how good you are. Games between by players of large knowledge differences are possible due to the excellent handicap system. You get/give some handicap stones and both players can play an interesting and exciting game just for fun - it's already clear who is the better player.

If the goddess of gaming would grant me perfect insight in one game I wouldn't have to think a second which one to choose.

A timeless game.  Seriously, Go was already floating around when existence began and it will be there when the last stars wink out of the sky.  I wouldn't be surprised if scientists finally discover that underneath all the quantum weirdness the universe is just playing a giant game of Go.

I spent some years doing nothing but playing Go, and in that time I discovered some fundamental things about life.  I am actually convinced that you can't learn something about Go without simultaneously learning something about life.  I have moved on to playing every other game ever made, but Go is always my first, before all things in its extreme elegance yet boundless depth.  I wish I had three lifetimes so I could spend two of them doing nothing but playing Go.  Thank you universe.

Go is the purest abstract strategy game.  If this is your KIND of game, then it MUST be a 10.  Even if you haven't been able to master it to any level, its absolute perfection cannot be denied.  Chess and Shogi and other games possess certain arbitrary elements that Go simply does not have.  If you do not like this game its because either you don't like abstract strategy games and/or you value winning too much.  With Go there is always a bigger fish out there that will leave you crying for your Mommy.

The simplicity of it could be described by saying that life on other planets likely play Go too with exactly the same rules. Its just that intuitive.  Go was neither invented nor conceived by man.  It was discovered, just as the water molecule was discovered.

Mastering the game's subtleties would take a lifetime.

Love this game, play whenever I can find time and/or an opponent.

I own several boards and sets of stones of various qualities and sizes (including some rather old slate and shell stones). I usually have a small portable set with me when I go out, so if you find me at a coffee shop or bar, just ask for a game!

I play on IGS with GoPanda. 

Way better than chess. Superlative elegance; simple rules with both deep strategy. With the handicap system both players always have a 50-50 chance of winning. Unlike the game doesn't have a run-away leader. Even when I know I'm losing I still play to the end to see the final scoring.

Without the internet it needs a big board and lots of pieces and scoring is clunky and not many westerners play it. None of that is a problem with IGS though and you can always find a game in less than a minute.

"My God, it's full of stars..." 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
Go is the true game of games. Go is an entire universe in one game. Go is enjoyable at any skill level and the handicap system can bring players of differing skill levels into balance.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
This really isn't a dislike but I really wish Go was more well known in Western culture. I could care less if Go is popular but when someone looks at a chess board they know its chess. It would be nice if the same were true for Go.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
Go is my favorite game and more than likely it will always be my favorite game.

After a couple plays, I'm really enjoying this game.  It is incredibly simple in premise, and surprisingly complex in practice.  The thing I find most exciting is how incredibly quickly the game can shift from offense to defense, and then back again.  The board is incredibly volatile in that sense, and it makes me interested just to see what's going to happen.

So far, I prefer playing on the smallest of the three standard board sizes.  It really isn't because it is "easier" on a smaller board.  Rather, we want to be able to complete a full game within the hour and find it doesn't happen on the larger board.

Strategy in its purest essence.
That's Go, and that's the best and the worst of it: takes a lot of time and effort to play just decently, after a game you can feel really tired, it is quite boring playing with someone better than you but also with someone worse than you, and chances are you won't get somebody around willing to play with more or less your same level.

RATING: 8
As a pure logic brain-burner, this game is probably close to perfection. No hidden information, no randomness, virtually no setup, the same chances, broad replayability.

If you want to get better at the game, you're facing a lot of spatial pattern math studying. You need to understand consequences of certain not-yet-happenning moves and react before they happen. This asks for a meticulous board analysis that obviously leads to AP. In many ways "better" than chess, because as the game progresses the board state becomes more interesting, giving more options and choices - at least far until the end game / surrender. In chess, in mid game your options are somewhat limited and in the endgame, the state is less and less.

9x9 board is a perfect introduction and allow for relatively quick matches in a timespan that's in a casual board game range. 13x13 becomes more serious and can take significantly longer. Full game of 19x19 is something I want to stay away from - too long and too brain burning. Keep in mind that game on 19x19 is really a different game when compared to 13x13 or 9x9. 

For a new-age casual boardgamer, Go might be too tedious and too plain (visually and mechanically), the entry level for a beginner is easy, but to get any better is quite hard. I would probably recommend some easier/narrower games that follow a similar thinking pattern, like games from GIPF project or Gigamic games, like Pylos, Quarto, or even Blokus, perhaphs.

This is an absolute 10, so that no other game in my Geeklist will be ever rated more than 9.

Oh, and it is so beautiful to see and touch !

Admire the game, no desire to play it. Too intense!

I'd rather play this on a 9x9 board, and play the beginner variant One-Capture Go (whoever captures a piece first wins).

Three versions: Cheap, full-sized version from Chinatown that consists of glass stones and a plastic board, which seems it's made from garbage bag plastic; a 13x13 magnetic travel version; and a 19x19 larger magnetic travel version.

The deepest abstract game invented and yet it could be described as an exceptionally bad design by Euro standards.  Its way too long and the potential for analysis paralysis is terrible.  The rules have some logical ambiguities - as evidenced by the different scoring sets.  It is not very easy to teach.  The strategy is  extremely opaque - good German games have clearly defined short-term objectives so you have something to strive for, yet it reveals further levels as you play it more.

My entry into gaming was really via 2-player abstracts, so I have enormous respect for Go. I played and studied it enthusiastically for about a year between 2010 and 2011, but I rarely find myself wanting to play it now, despite having a Go club more or less on my doorstep. I guess I've just drifted away from abstracts, as I've got more exposed to modern games - of course this is an enormous gain, but at the same time I feel it as a little bit of a loss.

Go is without doubt the supreme example of the cliche about great games taking a minute to learn but a lifetime to master.

This is the ultimate strategy game. Simple rules. Very susceptable to skill differences (more than 3 times more than chess) but with an effective handicap system. Player performance factors are very little to do with rote memorisation, yet are learnable. From the start each game is only about competing, rather than doing your own thing on the same board, with typical middle games that feel as if  a single wrong move would result in defeat. Fast games on a small board or longer games on a larger one. Why is this game so poorly known in the western world?

RATING: 10
The oldest game on Earth. The rules of the game make it so simple to play, but the strategies behind the moves are so incredibly deep. The more you play the game, the more you learn about what is behind every move. It's completely possible to get teachers to explain the game, in Eastern countries you can go to Go schools! But no matter how good any of us get - there will always be someone better. You can always learn something further about the game. The balance of the game is perfect too, with white getting 6.5 points to compensate for black getting the first move.

It's also a game that computers have not solved yet. While they can beat some of the lower level professionals - they cannot beat the top guys (yet!). 

I used to play tournament/league level chess, but after I discovered Go - I had no interest in going back to chess. Chess is just so limited a game compared to it!

Really the ultimate strategy game for me!

RATING: 8
Grueling learning curve, engrossing aftertaste. Each play is a treasure. I just wish I was better at it.

(+) Intuitive ruleset.
(+) Extraordinarily deep. Yes, the concept of game depth is actually correctly used here.
(+) Includes a handicap system to overcome differences in skill gaps of players.

(-) Almost requires immense investment in study to attain a level of proficiency. You can always play casually, of course, at the risk of the following:
(-) Dedicated players will, for lack of a better term, crush new players. Always. This isn't necessarily a negative point towards the design of the game, but more to reiterate what others have already mentioned to be true: this game is not particularly accessible for the masses.
(-) Not particularly exciting. Engrossing, certainly, just not exciting.

Deepest, supplest, most alive game. More warm and beautiful than chess. 

Sometimes you have to work out a 20-move forcing sequence to win a fight and afterwards you're all shaky and sweaty and adrenalized. And sometimes a spot just feels like the right one, and you take it, and by god it turns out to change the flow of the game.

This is the center of my game aesthetic.

Go is so simple that it can easily be overlooked by the casual gamer, but if you are introduced to this game by someone who knows how to play, it is easy to see the great depth of this game.

This game is really special, and it takes a tremendous amount of patience and dedication to really get good at. But even if you aren't good, it's still a heck of a lot of fun to play, against other people who are on your level or with a handicap against a good player.

It's interesting because I watched "Hikaru no Go", but I don't really get the appeal of the game.  I do realize, however, that that is likely because I don't quite understand this game in-depth.  It's a bit too complicated as an abstract game (no theme) for me, and I'm not going to invest the years' worth of time necessary to get good at it.

From the way of Go, the beauty of Japan and the Orient had fled. Everything had become science and regulation. [...] One conducted the battle only to win, and there was no margin for remembering the dignity and the fragrance of Go as an art.Yasunari Kawabata, The Master of Go

I really like Go.  It is by far my favorite traditional game.  Years ago I invested in nicer stones and board rather then playing with cheaper published sets.  Worth doing if you want to take the game seriously.

RATING: 10
The abstract strategy game which made me realize I can love abstract strategy games. A new cow-orker taught several of us in the mid 1990s (thanks Rob) and I was hooked immediately. Such surprising beautiful strategic depth arises from such simple minimalist rules. As one of the classics, it's easier to find opponents in real life and online than for most abstract strategy games, and the simple yet functional handicap system is a big advantage over most games. The long history and huge body of literature and culture significance is frosting on the cake.

While I lived in the US, I went to the US Go Congress each summer and most local tournaments. Now I play lots of other abstract strategy games in addition to Go, but I have no doubt I will be enjoying Go for the rest of my life.

THE pristine abstract game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The exemplary deep abstract game, much, much better than Chess by virtue of the great handicapping mechanic which allows much stronger players to still be challenged playing against (and teaching) weaker players. That said, the time investment needed to learn and improve at Go could be spent having a lot more fun playing many, many other games. It's more a hobby than a game (reading books, playing with stronger players, getting ranked and setting your handicap).

RATING: 9.3
Admittedly, I have not played this game nearly enough or have even come close to mastering any of the strategies to give it a fair score. Therefore, I'll just leave the score at a meaningless "7.9" until then.

RATING: 10
Still one of the best. There's a reason certain games withstand the test of time as they do. Interesting trivia: they still have yet to build a computer that can play Go on an internationally competitive level like they've done for Chess. There are just so many possibilities for each move - nearly endless.

RATING: 10
I used to rate go a "7" I really thought it was a great game, but I didn't dare put the time in to really knowing the game. I didn't want to become one dimensional in my gaming, and I had seen a lot of go players become just that. 

After several months like this I decided I would like to at least understand the game more. I purchased the first book in the Janice Kim series and started to study. I logged into KGS and started playing, found a teacher, and started to read more books.

I am to a point where Go takes up pretty much all of my online gaming time. I play on KGS and I read books and do problems. It hasn't replaced the multiplayer euros I enjoy, but it has replaced most of my 2 player gaming time.

Though the rules are as simple as it gets, this game has one of the steepest learning curves in games. Your first game will be the least entertaining game of go you play. If you stick with it, the games get better. Every game peels back a new layer of strategy. Something will click and you feel you have a handle on what makes the game tick, only to have a new revelation a few games later. New strategies brings new enjoyment and new tension. This has happened again and again for years.  And in 40 years, I am quite certain I'll be saying the same thing. How many games can that be said about?

Objectively, Go is a great game; however, I almost never find myself wanting to play it. The other major problem is that skill differences are magnified rather than diluted. It's positive feedback instead of negative, which makes it hard for two randomly chosen gamers to play an equal game.

Unique and fascinating game. It looks beautiful and has a wonderfully natural feel to it.

It's also a game for the manly man. It has really harsh and direct confrontations between the players, and often demands painful decisions. Getting hurt in this game really hurts.

The problem for me is that it is too intense for many occasions. Somehow I always have a headache by the end of the game. Maybe I'm not manly enough. I don't get headaches when I play LOTR: The Confrontation, so my fiancee and I mostly play that.

Learned the game with a friend in California while I was in a minimum wage service job, and he was doing his PhD in Philosophy. He mocked me mercilessly about my skill as he trounced me repeatedly. I walked away so mad I couldn't see straight--ok, I could deal with someone making me look like an idiot, and teaching Heidegger to masters students while I was a mere cashier. But mocking my gaming skill!?! I Walked away straight into the local bookstore to buy the Ishida 7-volume Go book set, which I studied day and night for a week--pausing only to eat and sleep--in preparation for our next game. That's right, I called in sick to work for a week in order to study a game! I crushed him mercilessly when we played next, then began playing Go more seriously--that intense time of Go study had been completely addictive, I found I didn't want to let it go. We rarely played after that (I was too far beyond his level at that point), but without his mocking of my intellectual capacity and gameplaying ability I might never have taken up Go as much as I have to date, which I'm grateful for. Thanks, Sha!

since then play much more casually, but still have fun. Great game.

Deep, fun, beautiful, and brain meltingly difficult. And I love the way conservative play is punished and inspiration rewarded.

Even as a newcomer, there's much more depth to the game than anything else that I have ever played, chess included. It's so refreshing to play a traditional game that not only holds its own against the best of the new stuff, but that also requires intelligent play and your full attention.

The existing body of commentary and strategy is fascinating, and focuses on pattern recognition and graceful, contemplative play. It's worth getting a book to start with, and I suggest 'Go for Beginners' by Iwamoto. As well as giving you all of the rules, and enough strategy to get you through the first 100 games or so, the book includes some interesting go problems, and some dan level games to replay at your leisure. A good companion book is Kano's 'Graded Go Problems for Beginners Vol 1' (Kiseido / Nihon Ki-in).

And don't bother with Chinese scoring... you'll have to learn Japanese style eventually, so you might as well jump right in. If you fear complexity this isn't your game, ne?

http://www.dragongoserver.net/ is an excellent turn-based (i.e. non-realtime PBEM style) go server that I highly recommend.

Currently double-digit kyu, and hopefully on the way up... the somewhat optimistic master plan is to hit 10k by the end of 2007. I'm happy to play / teach anyone interested in trying out the game. My pride and joy is my Japanese shin-kaya board and shell & slate stones.

Update: I did it. :)

The best game I've ever played - its rules are simple, but it has an unparalleled depth of strategy.  For me, moves are rarely pure calculation - the scale of the go board usually doesn't allow for that.  Instead, I've found that your instinct for what constitutes strong play slowly develops as you gain experience.  If you enjoy it, you can always work to learn more and take your game to another level.

I believe that if I had no other games and the opportunity to play this face to face with people I could be very happy sinking into Go. As it is, I am reluctant to get drawn into the game online (I try to minimise the time I spend sat in front of a computer screen), so unless I eventually find a committed player nearby who wants to coach my game, I am doomed only to dabble in this. I do like the tactile elements, the contemplative nature, and the way that dynamic things begin to happen from such a simple ruleset.

Not much in the fun department. Seems one dimensional to me with just the placement of pieces on the board. (Chess has its restricted movement based upon type of piece and capturing.) Go just doesn't interest me - neither do any of the GIPF/YINSH games (or anything else spelt in capitals) - some games are just too abstract for me - I prefer a theme, even if it's just tacked on.

The ultimate abstract game, this relies completely on strategy since there is no randomness to this game.

This is actually a very deep game, and I understand why some people rate it as highly as or higher than games such as chess. I've never played a more "positional" game than Go. The game is played on the intersections of a 19x19 grid board. Each player takes turns placing one piece of their color. You can play your piece on any empty intersection as long as it doesn't violate two rules which I'll mention in a second. Contiguously connected (non-diagonally) pieces are considered to be part of the same "army." If you place a piece so that it causes an opposing army to be entirely "surrounded" (that is, there is no play that will allow your opponent to increase that army in size), you capture those pieces and put them in front of you. The placement exceptions are: 1) Suicide. You can't place a piece if it would cause one of your armies (an army can be just one piece) to be captured immediately. 2) Infinity. You can't place a piece if it would cause repetition in the board layout (that is, if the board after your play would like like the board after your previous play). The game ends when no player has a move or (more likely) when both players concede the game is over. Dead zones are filled in, and pieces that both players acknowledge are doomed to be captured are captured right then and there. Then each player adds up their controlled (surrounded) spaces, and adds to that their captured pieces. The player with the higher point total wins. It's a very elegant game, but complex and sophisticated. Because of the many options, it's really not geared towards Western thinking. Excellent game, and if I was rating a game on any other scale I'd put this up to a 9 or 10, but on the BGG scale since I never bring this to the table the most I can give it is a 7.

Classic game, incredibly deep (much deeper than chess).  Except for possibly backgammon, probably the oldest game in the world as well, so it has obviously withstood the test of time.  Yet, the rules are quite simple.  An interesting thing I once read was that speculation that, if there are other intelligences in the universe, they almost certainly have independently discovered, and play Go.

Anyway, I rate this game an 8 and not a 10 just because I personally am not very good at Go at all.  I may be one of the worst Go players in the world (maybe the universe).

WHAT IS REALLY MINE

WHO'S AT THE TOP OF THE PILE

WHERE DOES HE DRAW THE LINE

LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT

GO ON AND STEP ACROSS

THAT WE ARE HERE TO GO

                        - Devo


Go is an abstract game, meaning what? It has simple rules, simple bits, and no overt theme. Place stones, capture stones with no remaining liberties, create living shapes to capture territory, and obey the ko rule. That's it. The thing is, go does have a rich theme, to me anyway. That theme can be a variety of things - it's really up to the player. Go is so satisying to me that I read books about it and solve go problems in my free time. I have dreams about it. When I was younger, I didn't get many opportunities to learn about it, unfortunately. But now, with things like the Kiseido Go Server, anyone with a computer can play pretty much anytime. Although not a big fan of playing games against other people on the computer, it's better than not playing at all.

So many things have been said about this game that it is hard to filter my own thoughts through all the commentary. If I could only play one game, this would be it. I like the way go tickles my mind - but even better, the game is incredibly exciting. I always found Chess to be kind of a turn off for me for some reason, and that prevented me from really investigating other abstract games. Years ago, I had played go a few times, and rated it about a 7 for a long time based on the memory of those games. Of course, I was a fool (that is, I robbed myself of playing more go, earlier!). I'm very glad that I dug a little deeper. Now I just have to be careful that I'm not consumed by my own passion for the game. :)

This is the type of game that has the potential for incredible play.  It gives me the same vibe as chess.  I can play it and do alright at it, but I don't really enjoy thinking of the myriad of possible options that could occur in the future.  It just gets tedious and turns can take forever if you play with someone who is AP prone.

I haven't played this much, so I'm, partially rating this on its potential. This is an incredibly deep game with a vast ocean of strategy to explore. Part of why I haven't explored it as much as I'd hoped is because it is a bit daunting. I have a set and my wife is interested, but I think she's a little daunted as well. Hopefully we'll get past this and get to explore it for the rest of our years!

You can never master the Game "Go" without professional teacher's lessons or many different levels of Go books. Don't waste your time for developing your Go skill by yourself. This is incredibly deep game. Far East people do not call Go Game but kind of mind sports. To me, Go is too complex, too serious and too deep. Hence, I do not play for a game. But...

Without a doubt, Go is the most intellectual and cerebral game ever created in human history though.

Okay, here's the problem: this game is *too* deep.  You heard me.  The design on its own, in theory, is phenomenal.  Elegance in simplicity. "The perfect game" some call it. But then here's what happens in practice: you start playing it a lot, you develop a huge appreciation for its depth, you start reading about it, you want to play a lot... but, your friends, who apparently have way more free time than you, do exponentially more studying than you, they become very good at the game, and now, by comparison, you're even worse at the game than you were before.  And come on, how much fun can that be?  So, if you're willing to invest a ridiculous amount of time into it, it's a great game.  But it also means you may have deep unhappy issues and probably require some psychiatric counselling.

My favourite game that survives us from ancient history!

I love the skill balancing mechanic in this game.  I can play against a noob, and once they understand the rules - if I give them a big enough early advantage with extra pieces on the board - it'll suddenly become a super challenging game for the both of us instead of a stomp.

I like this game a lot.  I admire the fact that such a simple set of rules produces such a deep game, and the game itself looks beautiful as the board fills with stone.  But I really don't know what I'm doing when I play, and can't manage to get past that stage.

I played Go for about two years in the past, but, as it usually happens with me, quit just before it got technical (I got up to 6-7 kyu and hit the ceiling after which I should really study hard). The game is simply perfect - surprisingly simple, unbelievably deep, and extremely rewarding. I own a very nice set but, alas, have nobody to play against these times (unless I rejoin the club, of course).
[Edit at end of 2011: rejoined and very happy about it]

I am the world's worst 27th kyu.  I've only recently begun teaching myself Go, and have done reasonably well on 9x9 and 13x13 boards.  I've but one actual victory on an 18x18 board, and I don't think he was taking it easy on me.  Either way, I was satisfied with my play and my experience.  And make no mistake, Go is an experience -- it's so very cliched to say it, but it's oh so much more than just a game.

I agree that it's a "deep" game but the secret to its depth lies in its redonkulously huge board. It's a game for people who can brute force calculations in their heads extremely efficiently. It lacks the sense of discovery that a lot of other games, including other combinatorial abstracts, offer and only manages to be "fun" through its sheer size. Take that away and you'll find that a lot of its depth just vanishes.

Gets a 10 out of 10 for being the pinnacle of "mechanically simple but deeply strategic" elegance in game design.

More than any other game I have ever played it demands real study and attention. In many games you can present a reasonable facscimile of knowing what you're doing by playing tactically; in Go, not only will you lose badly, in your early games you're unlikely to even see what you could have done better.

I love it, but I don't want to expend the time and effort required to improve.

{Abstract; area-control} Go is my most favorite abstract game. It's very deep and absolutely unforgiving. To play it well, you need to read books, learn from good teachers, watch many games from advanced players, remember classic patterns and train for 4 years.

Those who can play the game well rate it to be the best abstract ever.

RATING: 9
Such simple rules and yet so freakin' hard to play well.  This has to be the best pure strategy game ever.
This one's hard for me to rate because while I think it's a phenominal game, I hardly ever want to play it (mostly because I just don't grasp the strategy).  
I chose to rate it based on its quality as a game, not on how often I want to play it.

RATING: N/A
I think I like playing a lot of games more than mastering a few (unfortunately I don't have time to master a lot).  Go, Chess... these are games that reward mastering rather than occasional play.  I've instead sunk tons of hours into poker and Magic.  Maybe the wrong choice, but I've enjoyed it.

That's a long way of saying that I'm intimidated by the level of commitment required by Go.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Abstract Strategy - Mind-bogglingly Amazing - 2-Player - 1h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] My favorite game. 11/10.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Outstanding. This game has given me countless hours of fun. I fully expect to keep playing this for the rest of my life.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

I am a fortunate gamer in the sense that I already found my 'ultimate' game, and that game is Go.

I could talk about the thrill a close or hard-fought game can cause.

I could talk about the nigh infinite variations that come up to keep the game interesting and fresh.

I could talk about the pride you feel after a particularly sharp move or a just won game against an even-matched opponent.

I could talk about the sense of accomplishment you feel as you make progress.

But all that really doesn't do the game justice. You owe it to yourself to find someone who can show you how it works, in real life or online, and discover Go.

I prefer this ancient game to chess.
Takes along time to play, but it is clever and rewarding and you dont know whether your statergy is winning or loosing until near the end so it keeps you interested.
If you think your loosing and your opponent makes a less than perfect move the game can quickly swing back
I love it, when i can set the time aside to play it

The single greatest strategy of all time. The only downside to Go is that it's only two players, and you have to get deep into the strategy so that it effectively becomes a lifestyle.It's rough finding opponents since it takes most people YEARS to get to a decent level of play. And that's if they play several times a week.

I love Go and think it's a great strategic game. My main gripe, and the reason this isn't higher up, is that it's quite time consuming to give the game the attention it deserves. My strength is not at a level where casual play matches my expectations for the quality of the game, so to speak. And so there are a handful of games in my collection I would rather play, even if Go has its special aesthetic appeal.

This game is a 3M Bookshelf Classic game - it was manufactured in 1973. GO is probably the world's oldest board game in existence. It originated in China and various references date it back as far as 2356 B.C. It was brought to Japan about 1000-1200 years ago where it soon became the game for feudal lords, nobles and eventually the common people. Today it is Japan's most popular board game. We have the complete game consisting of the intersections and the stones, with explicit directions for strategies and rules of the game. It is all housed in this sturdy box so that it fits on a bookshelf. The picture on the front is from the Art Institute of Chicago "The Clarence Buckingham Collection of Japanese Prints, which show several Japanese ladies playing the game.

Go is a very simple game. You can easily teach it to a 6 year old child. But it is also the deepest and most complex game ever. You can devote your entire life to the game and still not master it.

The thing that is so magical about Go is that both the 6 year old newbie and the 60 year old professional grand master will have just as fun with the game. The ingenious handicap system allows you to play opponents of various skill and still have an even and exciting game.

Some people claim that Go requires to much study and time to play. That is nonsense. You can play it just as casually as any other game. The "problem" is that you WANT to get better at Go. The game has a bizarre power. You want to master it, even though you know that you never will.

Try it! Start small. A 9x9 board is enough in the beginning. It plays really fast and teaches you tactics and "close combat". Soon you'll be ready to tackle the "normal" board, 19x19. That's when you discover the real magic of Go. Now the game evolves into a strategy game.

Play it to have fun and to improve yourself - whether you win or lose.

I list this one because I acquired it and started playing Go in 1970 just as my involvement in the hobby of collecting and playing historical conflict simulations ("war games") was starting to take off, and I first played it with the same group of graduate student friends who were also my fellow gamers at the time.  Note, I do not list chess, because I started playing chess many years before HCSs came along for me.

This game is a beautiful gem. It still evolves to this day after being studied for 4000 years. There is no game that looks the same. You need to be very creative when you play. You can be a very good player even if you don't memorize anything. One of the deepest game ever and it takes a minute to learn. You can play it everyday for the rest of your life and you will still learn new things. It is easy for new players to get abstraction angst in this game though. There are so different many moves to chose from and its hard to evaluate the position. Once you get past this stage you will find that it is the best game ever.

The best game ever! As famously stated by Edward Lasker: "While the baroque rules of chess could only have been created by humans, the rules of go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play go." 

Five sets:
1) Chess-board-sized cardboard board, small plastic stones.
2) Plywood board, plastic stones.
3) Wooden folding board, glass stones.
4) 2 inch thick wooden board, good quality Japanese glass stones, nice wooden bowls.

I will never be as good at this as I would like to be (barring shedding all my worldly possessions and becoming some kind of crazy Go-hermit) but that doesn't change my rating. I always want to play it, even though I don't get to.

All ratings are, of course, subject to change, but I don't think it's likely in this case ;)

I went with a middle of the road roll up travel set. I'm very, very happy I went with the middle of the road set as in two face to face plays (and probably a hundred virtual plays) I would have already regretted and upgraded a cheaper set. The set I have now will have a spot with me as long as I enjoy Go, and I will have to give long and hard thought to dropping the money for a more traditional set when I have room for it.

This site - http://playgo.to/interactive/ - also increased my appreciation a great deal. ----- I definitely need to play Go more before I can really give it an accurate rating.  I've only played it 4 times so far, and I can tell that while I understand the rules, I don't understand the game at all.  That may be the sign of an incredible game that truly deserves a 10, but I'm probably not willing to invest the time and energy to ever fully appreciate the game (and thus, probably unfairly, will give it a 6 for now since it reflects the level of my desire to play).

Theoretically extremely interesting; but in practice it doesn't seem to be the kind of abstract I like to play. The handicapping helps more here than chess, but it's still very susceptible to the better-player effect -- even if you start out with 5 or 8 extra stones, you get your pants beaten off you every spot you try to compete and have to surrender whole areas to make places that even an expert won't try to invade...

"New Style Box" edition of the game from the 1960s. The box has noticeable amount of wear with the edges having some whitening and some parts of the art having been chipped over the years (the most noticeably from where a price sticker was removed by previous owner). One corner of the top half of the box is split but the bottom remains in great condition.

Inside the box is a folded 19x19 wooden board (with point markers for a 13x13 set up too) with hinge and clasp to keep closed. The folded board is hollow which allows it to also act as storage for the stones with each color having their own cardboard box with art. The boxes for the stones each have a split corner on the top half, but the bottom half remains in great condition similar to the outer box.

The actual game contents are near perfect. The board has 2 small parts where the paint for the lines has faded and 1 or 2 stones of each color has a slight blemish, but none of it effects the ability to play.

RATING: 10
Many plays decades ago. The greatest game ever created. The state of mind it creates between the players is of profound nuance and transport.

When I was a young man, I was introduced to Go by an art professor. She had a studio filled with Red Grooms paintings from her youth, a plaza open to the Florida night sky. We played Go almost daily for over a year. Our play formed me and remains a pristine memory, a ritual marker at my transition to adulthood, something so solid and uncorrupted I can slip into that state of mind.

I no longer play. It would not be wrong to set aside all modern board games and pick up Go. Maybe one day, like Peg, I can show someone young how to live well, how the aesthetics of the mind can be mirrored over something as simple as choosing a place for a stone, the responsive snap.

Several sets, including shell&slate stones in wood bowls w/ 2-1/2 inch board from trip to Finger Lakes NY (Canandaigua) - Also own Yunzi stones size 32 and a 2-1/2 inch bamboo board, plus a nice magnetic travel set, 3M Go, and others.  Just got a set of 42 size Yunzi stones (cleaned/oiled/polished) and Kaya bowls from YMI that are BEAUTIFUL.  I was disappointed to discover my Canandaigua board is too small for 23mm stones. But, my bamboo board, and 9x9/13x13 practice board, fit standard stones perfectly, so I'm okay! 

Go is probably the single best 2 player abstract strategy game there is, though the very best players will convince you the game is less abstract than it seems, and actually teaches military level strategy. The ideas of surrounding and capturing territory by complete enclosure, prevented by the formation of 2 eyes, comprises the totality of the game's objectives.  Regional shape is often used to describe game strategy. The complexity is exposed with the huge disparity between, and multiple levels of, game-play ability. Some players devote their lives to this game. I just dabble at it. (I also have collected a decent sized Go Library.)

A very good game.  If I was the sort of person who wanted to master a single game, then Go is the one I would choose.

But I'm not and I find that Go just doesn't work that well as a pickup game; you have to devote a fair amount of time to keeping the common joseki at your fingertips to play reasonably well.  I don't have that time (or the memory skills) anymore.

Got this game partly for its low price, partly for being included into my game collection, and mainly for having many black/white beads for cheap. 
Go is a classic Chinese game, embodying the ancient China miltary wisedom.
I learnt the rules, but have never practiced. I may, one day, further study it. But no plan at near future to research it yet. And I know, experience plays a dominant part to gaining proficiency of Go. The same factor for not to study it yet, as I am lazy.
2-player open abstract game is not my cup of tea.

Go is a game that I would love to master over a life time.  There are times when playing, you play a piece simply because it feels right as opposed to knowing that its a good move.  I've enjoyed how Go combines the intuitive with the analytics of a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Endless depth and one of the greatest games ever created. The simplicity of the rules makes this a marvel and a complete game. The scoring at the end is problematic, but at worse, you play it out till it's really obvious.

It's quite difficult to get to the table since you need a dedicated partner, and teaching people from the ground up isn't simple either. There's so much to teach and a lot is dependent on your own personal style and your ability to grasp the "feel" of the game. I'm not good enough to be able to pinpoint exactly why something is a good move or not except through gut instinct. Mind you, the number of terrible moves I make far outweigh the number of good moves.

Tactics and strategy abound in this abstract, and it disappoints me when people say that they refuse to play this because it's not thematic enough; use your imagination!

A good abstract with a LOT of memorization of patterns at the top end.

the simplicity of the rules is exaggerated (and in particular the claim of "only one/two/three" rules is wrong or fallacious).  it is a simple rules set, but it's not as astoundingly simple as people make it out to be.

Love this game. The ultimate abstract strategy game. I grew up playing chess and while I like chess, I find it boring compared to Go. Simpler rules and trillions upon trillions upon trillions more combinations. That’s not a joke. Scientists have done the math. There’s less atoms in the universe compared to possible games of go with an empty 19x19 board.

[7-11]I'm hooked, owning 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19 boards, I also tend to pick up small beginner boards when I see them at thrift shops so I can give them away to potential future players.  

I have SmartGo Pro on my phone and play that as well as playing on KGS, or other various websites as well.  I'm only about a 15 kyu player, but I do have an active go club in the area that I tap into from time to time.  It includes the designer of the SmartGo line, as well as some other strong players, I'd attend more but it's a 40 min commute.

A monster.  I played in high school and college (20 years ago), but never really figured out the basics, and never really got to the point where I could enjoy it.  I am now undergoing a relationship renewal with this game.  I have dropped down to a 9x9 trainer (igowin) that has really helped me understand some of the basics of life and death, and fighting.  It's starting to feel cramped, though, and I know I'm missing out on opening strategy, but I'm very excited to get back to this after many years of not playing.  Many unreported plays.

Go or Chess? Go. I like Go better because it's simpler. Because it's easier for a novice to begin playing fruitfully. Because no piece is better than any other. Go is quite possibly the best boardgame ever devised (on this planet, anyway); however, there are just as many folk who would put Chess on that pedestal. Both games are relatively simple to learn, but take a lifetime to master; but in my own personal experience, I would say that Go is more fun for the novice player for exactly that reason. With Chess, as a novice you reach the point very quickly where, in order to "seriously" play the game you pretty much have to devote a serious amount of time to the game. In my personal experience, Go's suitability as a recreational game, where the novice can fruitfully have fun playing the game, even against much better players, is higher than Chess.

RATING: 6
[i]Please note that my rating corresponds to how likely I am to play the game again.[/i] I would probably want to play this more often (probably at rating 8.x) if I could better diagnose the game state. e.g. I have very little idea how to determine which stones are dead at the end of (and indeed during) a game. There is an app called SmartGo that attempts to teach the game using reduced sized boards. Some day I want to reread Hikaru No Go, and see if I appreciate the game states. Currently I use the pieces as counters n other games.

RATING: 10
This rating is based on one play, I have a feeling it will go up because I can't stop thinking about this damn game which I can't see how I get better.

After a weekend unable to think about anything and doing Life And Death problems, playing against AIs (and two sets of real life games, one using the smartgo kifu board in a wagamama resturant)  I realised that this game is somewhere between a 9 and a 10 for me. I might stop enjoying it but I doubt I will. The thing I enjoy is the challenge of stop sucking at it, because it is hard to get better on. 

Damn it, I consumed some Go each day for weeks, I can't stop thinking about it. It takes me over it consumes me.

This is a better, more complicated version of Chess. Unfortunately, since I live in the U.S, I've never had many friends interested in it. As a result, I can only play the game at a very low level. Still, I can easily see people getting the same enjoyment from Go as I have from Chess. It's all about finding a community of passionate players that you actually like.

I know a lot of my criticisms of chess (overanalysis by fans, difficult to play if players are not on equal footing) could also apply to Go, but for whatever reason this game just captivates me. I find it very relaxing and enjoyable to play, even though I really have no idea what I'm doing. I doubt this will ever be a lifestyle game for me (unless I can convince my wife to make the jump from Othello to this), but it's something I enjoy playing when I have the opportunity.

Ok, I am in deep enough to finally feel I can rate this.  I have worked past the initial ramp up, and can say it is worth it.  I have played online at KGS enough to be rated at 18 kyu (I'd guess that means no longer a 'noob' but still a beginner).  GO is complex enough to remain unsolvable by today's computers, but simple enough to learn in a few minutes.  It can be frustrating in that you can't believe there is much to learn, but you are soundly beaten by stronger players.  A "mental martial art" is a good analogy since it takes a long time to gain mastery at GO.  If you put a little effort into this game, it can repay you with a lifetime of entertainment.  Solid 10 for me!

RATING: 6
Undoubtedly a brilliant game, worth of study, etc., but that's the problem (for me): it's too deep. It can't really be played casually (enough to enjoy it, which implies some comprehension of what you're doing). It also distinctly lacks angst, or sharp decision points, making it an incremental contest without much of the drama of its great rival, Chess. I think much of the allure here comes from the ability to play poorly but still accomplish *something*, a surprisingly modern trait for such an ancient game.

Go is a beautiful and fascinating game that I mess around with studying periodically.  Someday when I go through my drastic game-life simplification, it'll be one of the few I keep around, just for its endless depth.

That said, I don't find it as satisfying to play in person as the other abstract behemoths, in particular the chess family of games.  For some reason, moving pieces on a board just tickles my brain and sensibilities more than placing stones.  Thus, I find I like to study go more than play it, and when I get a hankering for a longer abstract, it's more likely to be chess or xiangqi than go.

My favorite game. I have played thousands of games of it, and am looking forward to thousands more. It requires an amazing mix of tactical puzzle solving, long term strategy, and intuition to play well. It's biggest flaw is that it has a brutal learning curve; the rules can be explained in a few minutes, but it usually takes several plays until you can grasp things enough to complete a game without help, then it takes months or years of regular play before you get past the beginner stage. This is a game for a lifelong hobby, not something you'll play a few times, enjoy, then put away.

Liked it so much I wrote an online server for go, http://www.gokgs.com/ (the KGS Go Server).

I had trouble rating this abstract. I know the rules but I don't fully understand them. I'm also too impulsive. I need to start playing full board, games of this. I usually play 9x9 vs a computer (igowin).

Elegant is a word often used and it's one I will use too. No luck all strategy. Probably longer than I'd like to spend on a two-player. Anyone I'd play with, including me, would have a hard time seeing a winner.

Needs more full board plays.

I am slowly getting better at this. My tactics are okay but my strategy sucks. A very deep and beautiful game. A substantial time comittment to understand.

A fantastic game that provides a totally different experience each time you play.  One of the few that I can't see myself ever growing tired of.

Najlepsza gra świata ;) i bodaj najstarsza zachowana gra ludzkiej cywilizacji. Trudna do bycia mistrzem, ale wejście jest proste. Jedna z najlepiej zbalansowanych gier abstrakcyjnych, wbudowane zasady wyrównania poziomów umiejętności graczy. Niezależna językowo.

Brilliance in simplicity.  Elegant.  Awe-inspiring.  I've dreamt about Go, that is how good it is.  And I'm terrible at it!

First off, I am very very amateur at this game and I don't think that will change any time in the near future. This is a classic, beautiful game.

I thought that I will get hooked into this, but no. After couple of plays this was just too much. Maybe I got wrong opponent.. but like chess, this is a classic (but not for me, it seems).

As far as I am concerned this is the pinnacle of board games in as far as I have played. The strategic options are endless and it truly is a battle of minds in that there is no luck. If you haven't ever played go play now.

RATING: 9
Beautifully simplistic and infinitely complicated.  A great game that, for me, symbolizes balance and harmony.

Editor's note:  I dropped it from a 10 to a 9.  Probably because I've been playing chess for over 20 years and I'm just that great at Go.

I wish my intellect was a bit more powerful. This game hurts my head more than any other. On the other hand I love the concept of a move being "pretty". I often play Puerto Rico or Agricola based on what I think is pretty. Unfortunately, there is much, much more to go, that I have never quite comprehended.

I WISH I were better at this game than I am.  Easy to explain, HARD to master.  A lifetime game. (Also, fun to watch for pure, tactical education).

If there had to be one game only, I'd vote for Go, even though I prefer to play Chess. It is not as tough on beginners as chess, and beginners should get gratification from their second game at latest (5 stones handicap on a 9x9).

That being said, I like the concept, but I do not like the rules. The Chinese ones are well defined, but they have hidden problems, and counting the Japanese way is much quicker. Reading the Japanese rules, however, makes you appreciate the clarity and elegance of Chess rules. If you doubt that, then do what almost no Go player did and read them.

The weak point of Go is that it really shines on large boards and on large boards only. On smaller boards, it is just ok. Compared to other boardgames, the Go-bang is ridiculously oversized and gives overlong games. I subtract a point for that.

After 1 Play: I just didn't get it.  I will defer to its longevity and give it another try, but I'd prefer to have someone who knows the game point me in the right direction.

I don't know if 10 will be true forever but i am sure that one of the most satisfying gaming experience i ever had was a recent recover and eventual win after a disastrous start at a game of Go.

I'd like to give this a 10, but really, I can see myself turning this down if I don't feel like it. Also, the rift between the newer player and the more experienced player is bigger than the Grand Canyon. That might be seen as a good thing, but basically it means that whenever I do feel like playing this, I won't have an opponent of the same or better strength. Other people I play against don't like being handicapped. I beat a friend with a handicap of 30 stones once because he gave up after I captured one of them.

Edit: Upgraded because I've been wanting to play this more again lately

In a parallel universe it might have been the lifestyle game for me. Here it became shogi instead and two lifestyle games is too much for me. But every once in a while go still looks really tempting.

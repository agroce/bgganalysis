RATING: 5
I've got the later version of this and also have the Battle of the River Plate variant.  I haven't played it in a long time.  My memory of it is that it is ok, but a little over-complicated in places.  I remember that it wasn't nearly as clean and enjoyable or exciting as Jutland, which is a similar sort of thing in the sense of search and battle on different areas.

Bismarck should be avoided by the majority of gamers out there due to its super complex rules. Nobody can remember all those rules. Have fun flipping through the manual every 30 seconds. Good luck finding an opponent. Good luck trying to devise a solitaire version too; it wouldn't be worth the trouble.

1962 version has three pages of rules!  It's light, and packs a lot of gaming into it.  The searching mechanic, with areas and zone cards, is multi-tiered, practical, fast and engaging.  The battleboard rules cut out the realism/difficulty of naval vector movement while keeping position and facing - just the right amount of detail to keep the game moving with the feel of battlewagons trading salvos.

RATING: 6
The "Neener, neener, neee-ner!" of naval wargames. As the Germans you're basically badgering the Brits--and hoping they don't get their mitts on you.

Playing with a mix of the basic and intermediate rules make this one worth a few sessions, especially if you're looking to get a friend interested in naval wargaming. Yes, Bismarck is dated, but the experience can be worth a few laughs and may stir up enough interest in the subject matter to prompt other sessions with other naval wargames. Plus I enjoy playing it on a lark from time to time.

A nice game to teach some history. The search aspect creates plenty of anxiety as the weather changes and the German commander attempts to outwit the British counterpart. Resolving battles on the battle board doesn't do the Bismarck justice, so the complex advanced combat is almost a must. Time has not degraded this one at all. (Vassal)

The intrigue of finding the Bismark. The difficulty of finding someone willing to play the game with you. The rockem sockem ending for the ship. The difficulty of learning the rules equates to a mixed bag and therefore a mid range rating.

RATING: 8
This rating is based upon the 1979 edition. 

My feelings on the game are a bit mixed. [i]Bismarck[/i] is like advanced [GameID=2250] but in that game you can ignore the historical errors because it is fun, plays fast, and is not ludicrous. [i]Bismarck[/i] is also fun but more rules means the game should have a greater attention to detail and [i]Bismarck[/i]'s details are spotty. Kondors cannot bomb and cruisers can easily damage battleships. Thankfully the intermediate and advanced rules can fix some issues but even then you need to do some fixes yourself. 

In the end this is a fun medium complexity wargame with lots of tension, but a few aspects of the game are lacking in terms of reality. Avalanche's [GameID=20590], while more complex in general, offers more options and doesn't have some of this game's issues.

RATING: 3.99999
One of my first games and I played it near to death. Once you make a search pattern you've got at least one cruiser in each of the larger squares where the Bismarck must be and you can track the Bismarck until it stumbles into a pack of Battleships. Then it's a dice fest on the Battle Board to sink it. Long past it's time but great back in the 60's.

I quite enjoyed this game.  It's a great two player game where one player controls one large German ship, the Bismarck, while the other player controls the Allied fleet.  There are too boards used in the game:  a search grid on a continental scale, and a battle board if the Bismarck has been located by any allied vessel.

Just one play.  I played the original 1962 edition.  The search is annoying.  Lots of fiddly bits for the Brit.  Once you get to battle, the German should avoid combat as much as possible and slip away.  More of a war-avoidance game than a wargame.

This was one of the first watgames I played, AND I LOVED IT!  My friend Henry and I played it several times (his game) and we had a blast.  I finally made a trade to get my hands on it in 2005, and although it's very simplistic today, it's still a fun intro game.  I've played the more recent AH edition as well, but they made it too complicated to be as much fun.

RATING: 10
I agree that the 1962 and 1978 versions are two different games and should have been listed separately.

 ***

My older son Robert and I played the 1st edition repeatedly.

One time, when he was about 8, we were on one of the Alaska state ferry boats going back up the Inside Passage and playing this in a booth in a lounge.  A young French tourist was fascinated with it.

If a kid loves the old game Battleship, this is the next step up.

I was not as enthused about the 2nd edition, although I have it.

Please consider my revision of the Hit Record, shown in the Images..

RATING: 7
The 1962 game is fun and quick playing game on the search for the dreadnought Bismarck.  Game emphasizes playability over realism, not for the die hard, but not a beer and pretzels game either.  Excellent introductory game to wargamming. The 1978 version emphasizes realism over playability and can be boring if the Bismarck isn&#039;t spotted.  There is so much to do searching for the Bismarck in the 1978 version, and while realistic its a bit dry.   I played the 1978 basic game version a couple times and the Bismarck wasn&#039;t ever drawn into battle and spotted only rarely.  I haven&#039;t tried the 1978 intermediate and advanced game versions.  Bismarck 1978 looks like and excellent choice for a play by email simulation game, but IMHO its a poor choice for a ftf play.  For ftf I highly recommend Bismarck 1962.

One of my favorite games from my 20s.  On the big board it plays like "Battleship" trying to locate the Bismarck.  Then you go to a battle board where you slug it out.  Excellent game.  Easy to learn and play, and interesting enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played the earliest Big Box edition and rules. Too many British crusier counters to fiddle with for the searching since the mostly likely outcome of every turn is knowing the exact Bismarck location. Was very frustrating as the British to (almost) always know where the Bismarck is but only having (AT BEST) about a 28% chance of getting a battleship contact on the next turn and then only a 30% chance of fighting at all if the Bismarck wishes to avoid combat. At an 8% chance per turn (max) to engage and the high probability that the 1st British battleship won't survive, combined with several convoy sinkings, I think the game is strongly biased towards the German player. Perhaps the later edition rules improve the game; I hope so.

This game gets its low rating because it is SO CLOSE to perfect...but then makes some TERRIBLE design decisions:
1) Weapons fire is modified by base 10 numbering, but rolled using D6, requiring a base 10 to base 6 conversion for results (which the rules so kindly explain how to do).  Madness!
2) Sparse pre-provided ship data
3) Game 'flow' is, itself, rather boring.  Given the topic, that's understandable, but the strategic "game" suffers as a result.  Launch the Bismarck.  Hide from the British.  If they find you, you eventually lose.  Not exciting.  The tactical engine works better as a simple skirmish generator (see above criticisms, though)

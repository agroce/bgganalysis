Heavy.  Heavy, heavy, heavy.

After two complete plays with five players, I am very impressed by this game.  A lot of the criticisms are justified (questionable board design, poorly written rules, etc), but the after an initial time investment to learn everything (as well as printing out the wonderful player aids by Ward) the gameplay is pretty straightforward.  

The beginning rush to grab territory and establish a military presence flows nicely into a mid-game featuring a lot of diplomacy and shaky alliances.  There is no real "power move" that one can employ, so making headway requires subtle timing and (usually) agreements with the other players.  The potential for deal-making is high due to varied faction objectives.  Turn 4 has featured careful maneuvering leading into the balls-to-the-wall Turn 5 free-for-all.  In both games played the final scores were very close and hinged on the last decisions by all five players.  

If you have 1-4 opponents willing to go through the initial learning curve there is a fantastic gaming experience here.

It fits the theme very well and felt like a game of building a strong nation from policies towards a flexible focused goal as the support you derive from support boxes keeps you strong as a foundation even if attacked on the board itself. It is a long term strategy game as like the real war there was not really a quick way to snuff out a religion or cultural norms quickly (Unless a player plays really badly maybe). 
That being said the board does get cluttered fast, there is a lot to keep track of and a hard knock on the table can be disastrous as the game is tight on every resource so even one piece less or more in an area makes a difference. And as always people easily offended by the constant 'backstabbing' (which this game has in spades) should be avoided at all cost. The game also does take a few hours to play but did not feel like it for me personally. 
Overall, I def. will play it again and enjoyed myself quite a bit with the group I played with.

Muy interesante. No es complicado, pero sí complejo a la hora de jugar y desarrollar una estrategia. es complicado desarrollar la estrategia y avanzar con ella. Tiene un pequeño problema en el movimiento interprovinical y el overflow que no terminamos de aclararnos suficientemente. Posiblemente sea un problema de traduccion. Sin embargo es equilibrado y muy competitivo. Repito: Muy interesante.

Dutch Revolt is the most complex area control game you will likely ever play.  It is deeply thematic, with factions divided along religious lines, but also over more earthly interests.  The factions are asymmetric in interesting ways, playing differently and with individual goals.  As you would expect from the designer of 1829 and Civilization, the game is multi-faceted with military power and religious allegiance impacting on political support. Dutch Revolt is a long game, but I've found it both engaging and enjoyable.   

The second edition rules are pretty clear and comprehensive.  All the same, this isn't an easy game to explain or understand.  The artwork is nicely thematic, though not the most functional.  Either you will need to swot up on your Low Countries geography or download the very excellent player aid from the Geek.

Would imagine this would be quite difficult to get into if you didn't have an understanding or appreciation of the era. After playing 'Here I Stand' however, this tends to flow on somewhat. having a Dutch gamer in the group also helps....

Being a fan of Advanced Civilization I can see the similarities with this game.

Tentative rating based on one play.  This is a heavier game dripping in theme which is something that always pulls me in, and I am looking forward to playing this again.  Beautiful gameboard and pieces which can be hard to read when you are unfamiliar with the board.  Our one play was with four players and I would like to try it again with five.  I know that one of the players who was in the game got of to a bad start, and is disinclined to give this game another shot.  I enjoy how the game sets up with similar but not exact same goals.  This keeps players in wary alliances.

Certainly a brilliant game, probably not as clean a design as Tresham's Civilization but good all the same.  With more familiarity R:tDR may become a 9 but the rules need a serious overhaul, there are way too many ambiguities.  Gamers have tried to make excuses for it but none wash with me.Update:  Dropped my rating.  Still no rules update so it's not getting on the table.  I really do not feel like going through the process *again* of digging through FAQs to figure out how the game is supposed to be played.  I prefer games where I can crack it open a month from now knowing that the rulebook contains the answer to any rules confusion.

Revolution: The Dutch Revolt almost requires everyone involved to have a player aid and to have an "updated" copy of the rules available.  Teaching this game to new players (who have not attempted to read the rules) would probably be too much of an undertaking for all involved without player aids.  Keep in mind that the rulebook included in the game is outdated, so please use the updated version found in the files section.

The font on the board is almost impossible to read, quite awful!  That said, I am (mostly) able to get past the above hurdles and find myself loving this game!  The theme of Revolution naturally has me comparing it to Here I Stand for both games involve the Reformation movement.  The fight for Universities, Bishoprics, Allegiance of Citizens, & Area Control in Revolution is better implemented and more captivating (to me anyway) than the die rolling in Here I Stand.

Keep in mind that I also enjoy playing Here I Stand for the secret negotiations are truly awesome in that game.  However, since I really do hate the massive die rolling of the Protestant & Catholic players, I felt compelled to compare the two games.

I thought there was a lot of klunky mechanisms in the game and I'm also not sold in the Civ like mechanic of having an inverse relationship between influence counters and income. Nonetheless as a game it was challenging and the history involved is interesting. It is a lot more of a euro than a historical game though. My first impression is positive, I would like to play it once more.

I REALLY tried to like this game but there is too much bookkeeping. I play complex wargames so complex rules don't faze me but all the tracking of titles to determine who controls the area and cities overwhelms me. If you can't tell who controls the area or city just by examining the board, then IMHO, the game is flawed. Plus the city influence must be replaced with the appropiate colour depending on who owns the city slows down the game (as if it wasn't slow enough). Really good artwork and heavy in theme. I find Phalanx games always have good components. Had trouble  reading the city titles due to the "writing" found on the game board. Disppointed with the whole game.

This game is quite difficult to grasp. It seems very deep. Has a very long and mechanical turn, that mix well with the interaction between players, a very  important aspect of the game.
My critic is the staticity the game has after the first two rounds (it last 5 plus an introductory one). The last three rounds are a build up for the eventual free for all that finish it. It's very difficult to enter a well defended province. Need more playing

Great game if you get passed the rules disputes. Beatiful mechanism and deep gameplay allthough a bit scripted. 

Play with 5 only as other numbers tend to limit your diplomatic options and make the game more static.

It's a game that requires a group that will play repeatedly to learn its nuances. The thing is, our first match of this wasn't fun enough to make us want to do that... In a world with Die Macher, 18xx, Struggle of Empires and other awesome super-long games that you get to play once every other month, I don't see much space for Revolution. Some interesting stuff is going on here, but a game that is 5 hours long and so complicated to explain and learn can't afford to be just "nice".

RATING: 9
Another Francis Tresham inspired triumph! You will recognize many elements straight from the Civ series transposed into an intriguing representation of the 1568-1648 period of political and religious upheaval in North Western Europe. Five factions with their own personalities, agendas and imperatives vie for dominance in the low countries.

Although not for the faint-hearted, this game will amply reward patience and persistence with richly rewarding game play. A different design choice regarding the font/script on the map and the cards would have certainly helped overcome the considerable learning curve this game presents. Rules debates carried on for far too long which may have added to the resistance to the wider acceptance of this game.

Still, it is well worth the effort to get past the poor graphic design choices and the somewhat opaque rules. Use the latest rules set and the FAQ (files on Geek) to enjoy one of the best strategy games out there!

Rating based on one play (4-player).  This is another one I really expected to love but that just fell flat for me.  I won as the Hapsburgs but couldn't honestly tell you how!  Some rules (like not being able to move influence except as a result of combat or overflow) seem contrived and caused much frustration.

RATING: 7
This is no wargame. It's a VERY subtle eurogame, which contains complex enough decision making so as not to be calculable, even in the face of no hidden information, and no luck whatsoever. Adapts some of the Civilization mechanisms to a more bounded and focused framework which emphasizes developing shared interests.

The mechanical overhead is quite high, and, in conjunction with the hard to read map, makes this a less enjoyable experience than it otherwise would be.

Tentative rating after one play. We had to stop in turn 3 after 4+ hours. Not sure yet if spending 5+ hours with this game is worth it. The system, however, seems well balanced despite having 6 factions, each of which plays differently. My main quibble is the map, which could be better (e.g. visible names for towns/cities).

RATING: 9
This title is not your usual euro, i.e., hodgepodge of tactical decisions pasted onto some meaningless thematic background.  Indeed, cult-of-the-new Kanban fanboys will likely find it "dry."

Dutch Revolt breaks that mold by not only calling for strategic thinking, but doing so in a way that evokes a sense of the divergent abilities and interests of those involved in the 80 Years War.

Your first game will more than likely be plagued by a few rules errors and some bad strategies and plays.  But there's a lot to like in this system. The game is remniscent of Dune in how the different factions have different strengths and victory requirements but seems to have a greater freedom of actions available to the players than Dune has.  

We played a four player game and had fun with it.  However, the Burghers player made some bad choices early on it seems which turned it into a three way race.  It seems like the Burghers player should have cashed in his English Bankers' gold right off the bad to raise some armies in order to crank out some armies with which to secure more cities which are a huge source of revenue.  Also, some of us felt that the game could have benefitted from having the fifth player and the Nobility faction as that would have helped slow down the Catholics and Hapsburgs which were making life miserable for the Protestants.  After a while the Catholics and Habsburgs started fighting which allowed the Reformers to grow and consolidate their holdings and secure 5 of the university towns.  At the end of the game, the Reformers managed to sneak in a victory with only .05 points more than the Catholics!

I'm looking forward to playing it again, as are my friends who were the Reformers and the Habsburgs, but the Burghers player was quite disappointed.  If we do manage to talk him into playing again, we'll have him be the Catholics or Habsburgs to try to give him a different experience.  I would certainly want to play a different faction - probably the Burghers or Nobility - we'll see.  And there certainly isn't enough stock to take care of all your population and money needs I'm going to definitely be looking to find that ideal balance.

Overall though, this is a very good game and has a definite Tresham-y feel to it which gives it a great, unique flavor.  Give it a try!

RATING: 8
With COIN and the Pax games bringing this style of game into the vogue, I've been pondering this on my shelf and whether it's worth trying to bring back out again. I always liked it quite a bit but it wasn't a huge success with the others I played it with. A lot depends on finding a comfortable metagame; if Revolution becomes too much of a negotiation game, I think it goes a bit off the rails (it'll take forever, and the interesting tactical details get buried by the negotiation dynamic). The other big problem of course is the presentation - graphically beautiful, but with unreadable fonts and low contrast. I've seen worse, but it makes it a bit harder to play than it should. Lastly, the factions are not all created equal; the Catholics (the historical big losers) have a tough row to hoe.

Still, despite these questions, I've always liked how this plays - dynamic but with positions solidifying over time, so it doesn't just turn into a last-turn bash-fest; the totally fluid COIN games kinda drive me nuts because you can never really protect your position. The systems are solid and are a nice balance of history and game.  While the graphics are problematic from a usability standpoint they are evocative.

So anyway, even though this is old, I'd totally play it again - I'm drawn back to it more than the problematic COIN games. But it is a bit of a wonky game that had a hard time catching on, despite being a really interesting and novel design.

Played once at Dragonflight 08. One playing of this game, especially with only a verbal introduction to the rules, is not enough for even a preliminary rating. That being said, I felt it was pretty fun but too overwrought and too long to garner much interest in playing again. Which isn't to say that it's a bad game. It might be a great game and I just haven't gotten to the point where I can experience it yet, or it might be a terrible game. All I can say for sure is that it's complex.

A clever assymetrical game of the Reformation in the Low Countries. I found it rather dull and procedural. There is a lot of downtime and counting up of things and players' positions remain fairly static after the initial deployment except for the Reformist player who can 'parachute' counters into any region with a university. Attractive but not totally functional board. The script is difficult to read and the borders aren't always clear. One play, 4 players, 5 1/2 hours. At least the end scoring was incredibly close though perhaps that was down to some precise kingmaking at the end.

This looks like a very intricate system - and possibly quite fun to play.  It's just a bit too long to play in an evening, so that's going to make it tough to bring out.

RATING: 8
This game is so much fun!  Kinda long (about 8 hours for our slow group), but it's worth it.  An understandable concern about this game is that it might cave in under its own weight, but I think that'll only happen if you let it.  Despite the famous 20-step turn with tons of interconnected elements, practically the turn is very straightforward: 1. Collect income. 2. Military operations (potential crowbars into new land or exciting sieges). 3. Populate areas and organize citizens. 4. Bribe cities (potential crowbars or exciting sieges) 5. Count points.

Despit the game's lather, rinse, repeat approach to its five turns, the story arc is tremendous: Catholics rule the roost at first, but the Reformers' crazy good support and cheap, cheap military will make them very strong towards the end.  Habsburgs and Burghers are weird fake allies to the extremists, just waiting for the right moment to stab them in the back.  Nobility are centrist snakes in the grass, hoping to slip under the radar while everyone else cuts each other up.

Complaints about the physical design are I guess warranted, but those who grin and bear it for a turn or so should find that the interface becomes invisible enough.

The rules, seriously?  Are fine.  Our first time through I got freaked out and played according to people's crazy interpretations of alleged inconsistencies and abiguities, but now we just play by the book and it's so much easier, and so much better.

Minor update 9.17.07: The 'revised' overflow language makes for a coherent and consistent game, and I am very happy to see it officially updated. Overflow has become another small potential wedge into a province. Sieges create small air pockets, which can sometimes be exploited by either the sieging faction or a nearby opportunist. Excellent.

Minor update 3.5.07: OK, overflow.  There are two ways to play overflow that make any kind of sense.  The first is by-the-book, where only running out of neutrals will allow for overflow past the first turn.  The second is to ignore neutrals for overflow purposes (but not steamroll over them, just add your units to the province).  I like either way just fine, but prefer to play by the book since that's the only consistent reference we have.  If errata is published that allows for more frequent overflow, that's fine too.

My feelings after several games are that decent planning should make overflow quite rare regardless, and truly only important for neutral-controlled areas.  This is most likely to have the largest impact in a 3-player game, and that configuration is where the published overflow rules are most likely to come into play.  I am generally very reluctant to say this about even the slightest rule ambiguity, but in this case the overflow crisis is truly a mountain out of a molehill.  The best thing everyone can do is make a decision according to personal taste and play that way.  The game will not suffer for it.

RATING: 3
Something of a train wreck of a game.

Revolution is based on some extremely fascinating ideas. Players each play unique factions which have different ways of accruing VPs and different costs associated with their militaries. It is zero luck, and it has a very attractive board.

So what's not to like?

Well...where to start?

First of all, that attractive map makes the game absolutely impossible to play. Cities are written in tiny, stylized font which requires a player aid to read (not included in box, thankfully available on the Geek if you really want to play this game) and the regions are very poorly drawn, as are the rivers, as are the universities, all of which are extremely important to the game.

Secondly, the game plods. I don't mind pushing cardboard around for a few hours, but there is way too much fiddle here for my palate. A tonne of chits are present as of the end of the initial round, and there isn't room for all of them in many areas, which makes seeing what is going on that much more difficult. These pieces seem to shuffle around constantly, and some of the ways in which they do, such as the "rearrangement phase" are quite cumbersome and slow the game down a lot. A good part of this plodding also seems to be because of the unintuitive turn order, which is still confusing even with the aid of a player aid. It is difficult to know without consulting the aid what order things occur in, which is often very, very important in this game. The reason it is difficult to know or remember is because the selection of order, while undoubtedly made for some very good reason, comes across as arbitrary within the game itself, and doesn't seem logical.

Third, the game seems to be poorly balanced. I can't hammer this very much, because one game is not enough to speak on balance with any authority, but it seems that the reformers have a little too easy of a time running over people with their extremely powerful military, and that the Catholics start off with way too many victory points which are a MAJOR amount of work for the other players to take away. Again, I'm sure with an experienced group the system is expected to self-balance (as is standard for conflict games) but for early plays it feels a bit silly, and I would suggest leaving the Catholics out if you can avoid it.

Fourth, and most importantly, the rules are horrible and they make the game take that much longer because it is so difficult to find particular rules when you need them, and the way in which they are worded when you do find them is so vague as to cause further confusion in most cases.

Fifth, the game just plays too long for what it is. I like games with politics and a tad of combat, but this clocked in at around 6 hours or so, and IMO a game needs to be doing something really special to be worth that kind of time investment, and this certainly isn't.

I'm not going to belabour this further, but Revolution is the good idea that wasn't. I like games which attempt to mix war and political aspects, and this seems to have a lot of nifty concepts but this presentation is flawed, too long, and just not that fun. I would love to see this streamlined down into a 3 or 4 hour game with a nicer board and a perfect manual, but as for this one...well, I hope I don't have to play it again. 

Revolution also stands to me as a lesson about giving name designers too much of a free hand. With some good development there could have been an interesting, 3 hour game made out of this mess. Phalanx instead seems to have let Tresham do what he wanted, and the result clearly shows the lack of a firm developmental hand, which would have increased playability, stream-lined the game down, and just tightened it up.

RATING: 5
Main gist of the rating is in my review (see the articles section for this game). Revolution is a complex game with elegant mechanics and an exceedingly strong theme. It will take many games to get a feeling for what to do at what point, but at the same time the deficiencies of the design become more and more apparent. Due to strong defenses and weak offenses it is very hard to change an existing situation on the board. Although there can still be surprise attacks, these are mostly dependent on where you can place your support. This gives the game a very programmed and static feel. It should appeal to fans of subtle power plays where timing is everything, but to me it is just a lot of work without much fun; this is compounded by the fact that the game is really quite fiddly, with lots of counting, updating of statuses, and too little room to get a clear view of the action. It is really too bad that the game wasn't streamlined and made more dynamic before being released because it would have been a genuine masterpiece. Right now it is hamstrung: still able to move and show off its good parts, but these are nearly drowning in the total of small and large issues. Eventually dropped from a 6 to a 5 because I have no intention of playing this game myself again, although I will be around to teach someone else, if they're interested.

[b]Update[/b] At the time of writing, the game never has not been out of the box since well over two years now, and the rules update from Phalanx, despite being immensely useful in removing inconsistencies and unclarities, were not what I would consider to be necessary to get me back to playing this game. The game was let go, but left me a little bit wiser about what I like and what I like less.

A typical Tresham design that borrows much from Civilization. The components are attractive but the map is NOT user friendly. A very detailed game, not for the casual boardgamer.

I have very mixed feelings about the game. There are a couple of serious problems with the rules and the space/colour issues on the map are a problem.

I played basically 1 1/2 turns of this game, which is certainly enough for me to know that I will never try to play it again.  Way too much complexity for too little payoff.  Plus, the board looks great, but is not very functional.  Whose idea was it to put the town names in small cursive writing in a places easily covered by counters, then require you to refer constantly  to the town names?  

I'm actually torn regarding whether to rate this.  I haven't played a full game, and don't like to rate games I haven't given a fair shake, but I've played enough to know how I feel about it.  I thought I would like it, but this is not a game for me.

This game is made for hard gamers.It is a limited edition game and the board is wonderful. The system is a kind of political majority placements with 20 developement phases each turns.The game length is between 4 and 8 hours of play.
In the first time , the systeme and the thematic was very interesting but i found the gameplay with a lack of dinamism with is 20 phases each turn.
The game last 6 turns and in the 4th, my friends and i were a little bored of it. I could say welcome to the game collectors that's a biutifull game with great ideas but ...it is quite slow and long..

Tentative rating after 1 play. This is an interesting and clever game in some ways. Unfortunately, whatever I liked about it was ruined by an attractive but seriously dysfunctional map, badly translated and/or ambiguous rules, too much book keeping, and excessive playing time. With a better map, better rules and better counters I could be convinced to play again. But until then I honestly don't ever see myself playing a full game of Revolution. It's a 4 hour game that takes at least 6 hours to play.

After two days reflection on our first playing of this (a 4 player game) I am very impressed with this design. Here's what I like:

1. Simple clean mechanics
2. No luck
3. Interesting historical situation
4. Asymmetrical starting positions, assets and victory conditions
5. Nice components (although the map is quite busy)

The only "bad" things about the game are that it takes 4-5 hours (but is fun throughout) and the unclear rules on overflow and city/province control (these are somewhat cleaned up in the FAQ and support from BGG).

I think this will become a game which gains a larger and larger following.

Recommended - rating may rise or fall after a few more plays and playing with different numbers of players.

Very deep, very interesting area majority game with a few wrinkles. Don't be put off by the rules or the length of the game. The rules will start to make sense after one turn and, once the group gets the hang of things, a game can be brought to completion in under 5 hours. 
While the artwork is gorgeous, it does make play harder with the hard to read fancy font and a map that should be 50% bigger.
One thing to keep in mind: while the end of round scoring can give you an idea of where you stand, they are not indicative of who will necessarily win. Since score is not cumulative, you're really playing for position in the last round to do a big splash and accumulate the points then.
Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
A game with a mere 5.5 rounds of play, and about 20 phases in each round.  Phases earlier in the round can have an effect on phases later in the round and a lot happens on the board between the first phase and the 85,000th phase at the end of each round.  This sounds painful, and this isn't a game for everyone, but it definitely was worthwhile for me.

Sure, it takes a lot of work, but the way the game unfolds is really interesting.  There is a lot to take into account and I always have a soft spot for games where each player has different goals.  It will be good to play this one again, as it takes a bit to even remotely grasp the possibilities.

The production is really nice in terms of the look of the game, but it certainly isn't practical.  You get used to it, but this is definitely a case of 'look' over 'function'.

Wow, these rules are horrible!  Fifteen years of development by Tresham, and Phalanx can't even produce a coherent rule set?  There are tons of outright contradictions, many of which still have not been resolved.  Phalanx's rules have exhibited a remarkable consistency for being inconsistent, an alarming trend that will probably keep me away from any of their more rules-intensive games in the future.  **Update** I've now played for the first time, and the rules are even worse than I had realized.  Holes, holes everywhere, as well as contradictions.  All four of us had read the rules, and we were diligent in trying to iron out everything ahead of time, but still had to make stuff up as we went along.

The first thing I'd say about Revolution is that it's not a game for dabblers.  The game presents a huge start-up cost in terms of sorting out the rules, and working out the nuances of the arcane sequence of play and the strategic approaches toward the five different starting positions.  This is a game to play repeatedly with the same group, or not at all.  Your first game is likely to be a frustrating experience.

So how is the game?  It is "okay" - maybe, barely, at best.  In theory, I would like to give it one more try simply because the game strategies are very opaque the first time through, especially when you're constantly struggling against the rules.  In actual fact, though, I will never have the chance to play this game a second time.  It would require four willing opponents who have at least one game under their belts.  In our group, there was only one other player who could have been convinced to give it a second chance.  None of us liked the game.  You spend most of your time bookkeeping and counting and moving pieces around semi-aimlessly.  I'm sure the aimlessness would disappear after two or three games, but this one will unfortunately never get there.  A game of this length needs to much better than "okay" in order to be worth playing.  There is absolutely no reason to ever play this over Civilization unless you are (a) a masochist, (b) a doctoral student in the 80 Years War, (c) Martin Luther, or (d) a 100% new-game-thrill-of-first-play junkie.

P.S. Dear Phalanx, you are designing a game board, not an objet d'art.  I need to read the names of towns and cities, I need to tell towns from cities, I need to see where the rivers travel, I need to see the boundaries between provinces, I need to be able to find specific towns, I need room to place my pieces, I need to read what is written on the support boxes, etc. etc.  Terrible, terrible mind-boggling game development!  There's an average-ish game with subtle strategies in here somewhere, but unfortunately Phalanx buried it beyond any realistic hope of resurrection.

A challenging and demanding game that improves with repeated play like fine wine.

Top notch production quality. The colours of the counters, cursive labels and the cramped map do present some playability issues but this is overcome with familiarity.

I would rate it a '10' if it weren't for the lack of consensus on some ambiguities in the rules - The rule updates are out, increased my rating!

I like this game, but had to lower my rating from 8 to 7.   My group of experienced gamers have tackled this twice and it just seems too tough for yellow (Catholics) and red (Habsburgs) - let alone blue (Burghers) - to overcome green (Nobility) and especially orange (Reformers).  Orange's ability to keep itself last in the turn order makes it incredibly strong in the "Influence" phase  (6.16, aka bribery of citizens).  I am intrigued by the reports from gamers who won as red or yellow.  I played both in the two games; one starts these factions at/near 10 VP and never really gets above that level.   Blue seems absolutely impossible.  We enjoyed the two games, but it's hard to ask people to play a lengthy game where there seems to be little chance of finishing first.

Given the level of detail in the sequence of play (20 or so phases in each turn!), I suspect there is a good game here, but it is not for the faint of heart.  If you are not ready to invest a good chunk of time, do not attempt to play this one.

The conflict resolution mechanic stems from Civilization.

An intriguing majorities game with no randomness, just the decisions made by the players. Sadly, the artist has gone for a period feel over clarity and a few details of the map could have been done better. The gorgeous playing pieces are similarly dysfunctional as they have to be stacked, making it impossible to tell who's in control of a region without picking them up and counting them (and you'll spend A LOT of time counting in this game). Some nice mechanisms, although there are just a few too many rules for some fiddly sub-systems that don't really add much (hugenots raiding treasure ships, bishopric assignment). Playing time is also an issue at 5+ hours, but at least that's less than Civilization.

Wow, this a heavy piece to swallow! The game is intense but it flows slowly. Many decisions to take. Sometimes the gameboard is somewhat overcrowded and that makes it difficult to see what's going on on the board. It takes 6 to 8 hours to finish a game and the consequences of your moves sometimes are hard to oversee. The game looks good, a nice gameboard, nice playing cards and nice counters. The rulebook, though nicely illustrated, leaves space for interpretation.

RATING: 9
I've played Revolution three times now (with 4 and 5 players) and the last play was the most interesting (perhaps because we are finally getting to grips with some of the subtleties of the game). Revolution is tactically rich, and the can be lost or won on a tactical level. However, there is also a convincing strategic "narrative" which develops through the 5 game turns. Each player starts from a different position, with the Catholics being resource-rich while the Reformers are relatively poor. However, the Catholics suffer later in the game from the high cost of raising and maintaining armies, while the Reformers have access to inexpensive armies. The geography also adds both complexity and interest to the game. Each player has a very different view of the board due to the asymmetry of the starting positions and ability to use different support boxes, which enable units to be placed in various provinces on the board. The strong historical theme is further supported by good-quality components (although the board should be larger, the city/town names are difficult to read and the VPs values of provinces are lacking). The rulebook could certainly be more user-friendly. In most cases it does a good job of explaining or providing examples for the many rules. However a number of rules are not clear because the text is ambiguous and no examples are play are provided. Other weak points: in turns 3 & 4 the limited number of resource/money pieces seems to become too important a factor, detracting from other aspects of the game; the result of any game is determined to a great extent on turn 5 which means that good planning for, and execution of, your final turn is crucial. Overall verdict: despite the flaws, this can be a very rewarding game if you are prepared to put some time into it and if the theme is to your taste.

I had my first play of this game, with three players, and enjoyed it tremendously.  As has been noted many times, the font on the city and town names slows things down a bit, but to me that was only a minor quibble.   The different goals for the various players seems to work quite well, although if you get out to an early lead expect to be hammered from all sides.   I really didn't find the rules that difficult to comprehend,but then again I've been playing ASL lately so most rule sets are easy compared to that one.   Lots of room for strategy, and despite the length, I felt involved the entire time.  I will say the game length will be somewhat linear with the number of players, but with three I didn't feel like there was that much down time.   Great game.

Rating played two 5-faction solo plays and one face to face game (one Nobility, two Reformer wins). Definitely a wargame (unlike the designer's earlier games), this features subtle, interlocking mechanics, asymmetric sides (each player must achieve different things to do well within the same game structure), and very attractive components. Can play long, but I find it deeply engrossing while you're in the game.

I'm starting this one out at an 8, but it could move up. Fun re-creation of an obscure part of world history. Area control game with intricate, complex relationships between the different game elements. Despite the complexity of relationships, the game progresses in a processional manner and the rules themselves are not complex. The board is not quite large enough and the print is all in small script. Too much time is spent hunting the hard to read board for particular cities. I need to play the game more to decide how balanced the different factions are. If I find the game has excellent balance as well as complex interactions and smooth mechanics, I'll score this a 9. This game is very aggressive.

Hm... a first play that ended after turn two left me quite disappointed. I really thought I had the rules down but there were so many questions to whom answers couldn't be found in the rulebook that it left us quite exhausted and confused so we called it after roughly 6 hours of play. Not quite sure what to make of this.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

A very abstract representation that still feels vaguely simulative because the theme is built into the basic mechanics and goals rather than being added chrome. It's a pretty smooth game but has hidden complexity, which is enjoyable. Seems to offer different dynamics based upon the number of players.

The big problem is that the rules have too many omissions and vagaries for a 16 page booklet. There is a revised pdf version on bgg but it isn't the elegant rules book the game deserves.

I wonder about how some of the inter-faction strategy does or does not relate to history. The game itself won't teach you much history but the map is beautiful and will teach you Dutch and Belgian geography. I'd be curious to return to it after reading a book on the conflict.

Some minor confusion in the rules. The mapboard, whilst nice, is too small. The counter, whilst nice, do not provide contrast with the board. Found that players get "lost" in the game by not being able to see what is going on due to map & coutners.

Damn, this is just pure fun (which is not totally obvious from the theme and title). All the games have had a nice mixture of planning, scheming, allying, backstabbing and wild twists of events, so this never gets boring even when played for 9 hours (though now we have managed to cut the time down to 6 hours or so).

Single play.  We spent an hour on the rules, and 4 hours on the game.  (3 player)  It took me 3/4s of the game to begin to really understand how the game worked.  There is a lot here to process.  I liked it a fair bit.  I think there may be better longer games, so I'm unsure how often I'll choose this over other longer favorites.  But I would play this again given enough time and willing opponents.

After one play.  While the game board is pretty, it's hard to read the names of the towns and cities.  On top of that, it gets very "busy" and crowded during game play and it's sometimes very difficult to tell the factions apart.  Game is interesting but I'm not yet sure it's worth the time it takes to play it.  (Which means I need to play it again before I make up my mind.  Is that a Catch-22, or what?)

Very good area-majority strategy game with a lot of different mechanisms and subsystems that blend together very nicely. Each of the factions/players has different objectives to ensure a more or less historic gameflow (might sound restricting, but the challenge is different each time you play with another faction). Longish game - mostly up to 9 hours. Administration phases can get a bit tedious. *** 31/03/2007: Fun to win with the Catholics (strong at the start, but usually beaten to death by the end), although it was rather close (0.45 points difference with second - my total: 15.45). *** 29/01/2011: Won with the Nobility (5 players - 0.07 points difference with second - my total 16.02). *** 19/02/2011: Won with the Reformers (4 players - again a points difference of less than 0.50).

In one sense, this is a masterpiece of interlocking movement, battle, and resource mechanisms.  The board and components are well illustrated though the board is much too busy and a bit dark.  There are some fairly crucial lacunae in the rules.  Ultimately, an adequate exploration of the game's strategeies would require many replayings -- replayings that are unlikely to occur in my case.

If it was shorter it would get more plays. My game took 6 hours (5players) but it felt like 4 hours tops.

It is unbalanced but it wouldn't be so good if it was balanced.

You get a great sense of history evolving and you get subgames in the game itself.

Phanlanx has produced some very good game like Age of Napoleon on the one hand, but medicore like Nero on the other.  I have high hope on this one as it claimed to be designed for over 15 years!  Let's hope that it means the research effort, and not the game mechanics. The Dutch Revolt has an affect on the development of Thrity Years War in Europe, which is a gaming subject I am so attracted to.  Great art on map and box, just like Age of Napoleon and the upcoming First World War.  However, someone at BROGfest 2005 who played it described it as "overwrought and fiddly".  You know, designing a good game ain't that ever easy.    

Don't let the packaging fools you any. It looks like a Euro but it's not. A lot of complex interaction inside the gaming systems and mechanics. Sometimes we get lost with the counting and the next phase we are going to do. A closer look at the playing aid downloaded from the internet might help. We checked a lot with the rulebook. Even though it lasts 5 turns only, 6 if you count the turn 0, there are up to a dozen phases inside a turn. 

Each faction in the game has its own agenda and thus victory points. The furtherance of your faction's objectives, while cooperating with others, or competing at the right time, is essential to your winning. 

The concept of town and city plays a very subtle part in the game. Surely you would have known a lot better about the Dutch geography and its surroundings. It's better you recognize many city names to save you play time and focus on your strategy. Controlling cities and provinces awards you points. The Noble could gain points by expanding its resources also. They are a kind of balancing force in a 3-player game. 

The Catholics was on the lead the first 2 turns as the bishoprics remain intact and largely untouched. Some treasures were "shipped" to the Reformers as they used Houegemonts to catch the Spanish treasure fleets. So the Catholics stopped doing that not long after. 

The Reformers mainly went for the northern part of Holland, where majority are neturals. You can convert a netrual into one of your resource points, as long as the resource limit is not exceeded. You gain resources mainly through expanding your influencing towns and the rurals, which have your faction support already, support boxes,cities under your control etc. The Reformers gain VPs through controlling the unitversities, the center of spreading the news of God. 

Overall, a good game system and mechanic in simulating the Eighty Years War in 5 turns. A little bit abstract. But the overall result is quite close to that of history. For a 5-people game, there would be a lot more interactions among the factions and a much tenser game.

Very interesting game. The theme and the asymmetric factions  are fascinating, although the mechanics somehow feel a bit... clinical and boring. No dice and no card draw means no luck factor, which feels very fresh and combined with the theme really make you feel like you're planning and executing real war actions in late renaissance Europe. Should be played in candle light in a 17th century castle for maximum immersion, but in the lack of a castle any suitable Baroque-style interior decoration will do...

2 Plays - Played a 3-player game. This is an interesting game. There is a lot going on here. Lots of choices. I played the Catholics and found out just how important buying the allegiance of your citizens really is a painful...but fun, lesson.
Last played with Ben and Steve 11-05 

[UPDATE - 3/25/11] - After 5 and half years we finally got this back on the table. I remember thinking this was a really cool game from my first experience and since that time I have been longing to get the stars aligned (right group and right time) so I could enjoy another play of this game. I'm surprised I didn't finish my initial comment with "...I hope we can get this on the table again soon."

What a difference 5 plus years can make. I still think it's a cool game, but after playing thousands of games and trying to design my own game I have to say I think this game is a bit of a train-wreck. 

In working on my own game design, I have worked hard to refine and simplify mechanics. I have agonized over making things graphically intuitive. I have struggled with writing clear and concise rules. Revolution: The Dutch Revolt just smacks of designer (and publisher) arrogance. Playing this game requires too much effort...and so much of the problems are in the presentation.

The mechanics, while innovative, are fiddly and clunky, the map—gorgeous to look at—is an information design nightmare, and the rules are very poorly written (or translated). I felt my patience being tested as we found ourselves looking up FAQs and parsing sentences in the rulebook. As the night worn on (six plus hours of play) the game unfolded nicely and I could see the game system that had impressed me all those years ago. But in the end I feel dissatisfied. I have come to believe that game designs should offer players a certain elegance which balances between simplicity of play and depth of choice and interaction. It's like trying to write the perfect pop song...just a few chords...the right lyrics...simple right? Ha!

I am downgrading my initial rating from an "8" to a "6." I would play it again because in the end, it is a cool game and a cool theme...but I ask myself "why would I?" There are just too many elegantly designed games out there which give me greater satisfaction with less clutter and "noise."

I love Tresham's Civilization, but this combines similar mechanics into a tedious, fiddly, long game.  Nothing is simultaneous, and so even though it's only seven turns, it takes forever.  And defense is so strong that it's an exercise in stalemate.  The asymmetric abilities are a nice idea, but they just give every group a stronghold and so lock in the board position into unassailable strongholds.  The game is then so artificially tight that there is a ton of kingmaking at the end.

RATING: 9
A heavy strategy game with no random factor, no hidden information. Only 5 and a half turns are given, so strategy covering a whole game is needed. Five factions with different conditions allows various strategies and great replayability. Well-themed, arouses great historical feelings.

UPDATE:The more I play this, the more I find hidden subtleties: importance of clever use of support boxes; significance of controlling trading partners; resources are always limited - you should know where to give up and where to keep, when to expand and when to shrink, when to fight and when to retreat; first few turns are for power construction, it is slow and progressive, but after that attempts for power shift occur - some will succeed and some will fail. So when to rush? Timing matters.

Looking through the rules, this seemed complex. But it was not - gameplay was very smooth. Now again I feel this game much more complex - because of all those subleties and factors to count. This games needs learning(not accounting nor analyzing), and learning rewards. I love this.

(Sadly there is almost none around me who want to play this... I usually play it with myself)

One complaint: Some important informations are scattered so hard to catch. 1) Tax rate and victory point for each province. 2) Trading partners(Cities/towns listed in city card). To play this competently and to feel the depth of this game, knowing those informations is necessary. But they are scattered on each cards, so you will know them after you have them... I think there should be a concentrated player aid.

The only reason this doesn't get rated higher is the length.

Not recommended to play with a mix of veterans and noobs unless the vets are going to do some serious hand-holding for the first 1-2 turns.  Somewhat easy to make a mistake that can make the next 4-5 hours quite painful...

2 games now. 1 4 player & 1 5 player. I think it worked best as a 4th player, the Nobility can not be kicked out of somewhere they choose to make their power-base.

It's interesting still. Further play required to try & break the game, but what I see as a weakness for one power may be seen as a strength for another power, thus the more play required.

Initial impressions - Feels very Treshamy, which is a Good Thing for me. Takes some mechanics out of Civ, but feels unlike any other game I've played. There are some issues with component colours in artificial light, and I'm currently putting together a few player aids to speed up recognising what the various factions are aiming for.
My biggest gripe is the typeface used for the city/town names. While it is evocative, it isn't really clear enough. Apart from that, the production is sumptuous, and the artwork outstanding.

I admire the idea of a wargame with open information and no randomness. The components are gorgeous, and the play can be fun. 

It has drawbacks that make it hard to get on the table.  For one, its long.  Also, the rules are slippery, despite all the clarifications that have been published.  I think it is because there are so many phases, and the treatment of things like the number of pieces you can place in a province, and what happens to excess pieces, is different in different phases.  Mistakes in the early game are very hard to overcome.

Gasp.  This is a great, great game.  Now three plays (with 4 people, 5.5 hours and twice with 5 players, 6 hours) but it is being mentioned among Civilization, Die Macher, and 1830.  Tension, various paths to victory, interactive elements, close finishes... this one has it all.  If you don't mind longer games, this is the one.  An Essen '04 buy... and I waited quite a while to get a copy.  Was it worth it!!  Map is great, fluid game, and all the stuff about complex rules is a little overblown: we never had any problems, and played fast.

I think the game has sacrificed to much in terms of practical game play for looks. The map looks wonderful but is not as practical as it should have been.

After several playings, I think this is a very fun game.

Long game, 6+ hours. Some mechanics similar to Civilization (balance of stock-money). Interesting but a bit fiddly, and too long. On reflection it strikes me that despite interesting mechanics turn-to-turn, and lots of decisions to be made, there is very little feeling of any progress or achievement in the game, even for the extreme factions which are trying to sway the cities on the conversion track. There is no real development, no real building of forces or resources, not even any notching up victory points or bonuses for later.

Five hour game depicting the 80 years war of Holland against Spain. Each player plays a faction: 1) Catholics, 2) Burghers, 3) Hasburghers, 4) Nobility or 5) Reformers, each of which have their own traits and ways of earning VPs. Players can build armys, put on units, and use religious influence to attempt to control cities and regions in 1568 Holland. There are some rules problems (overflow really hasn't been addressed by the publisher). It is a long game, and near the end, the ownership of regions will not change much.

[b]Revolution: The Dutch Revolt 1568-1648[/b]

Designed by the legendary [person=58]Francis Tresham[/person] ([thing=71][/thing], [thing=421][/thing]...)

Strategy game for 2-5 players. 

Simulates the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands, which lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces.

What attracted me to this game? The promise of zero luck,  winner is not known till game end, and the legendary game designer. (About zero luck in games: I don't think some Chance in strategy games is necessarily a bad thing, after all the real world is not 100% predictable.)

Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.

I like the theme and the asymmetrical victory conditions. Very innovative (and rather convincing) way of showing the interaction of politics, religion and economics in pre-1648 Europe. Great game on a fascinating period. I like it as much as Republic of Rome but it is much more accessible. I like it all the more as my grandmother was Dutch, my father was Catholic, my mother is Reformed and my sister is a Noble. No Habsburg in the family yet, though.

The rules are unclear and ambiguous, but you should use the May 2007 rules from the Phalanx webiste, they clear all rule problems

This is a brilliant game. The game system offers endless possibilities for strategies and tactics. Because negotiations and alliances, promises, bribery and backstabbing are in such a big role it is impossible to see beforehand how things will turn out. The components are top notch and the board is a beauty to look at. There are, however, some problems that come with the beauty of the board. The names of cities and towns are annoyingly difficult to read. Before playing one should download the excellent player handouts from this site. They fix these minor problems. The learning curve is very steep but the gaming experience could hardly be better. Highly recommended!

A game that I really want to like.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem quite finished, and there's not enough interesting and compelling interaction/choices to be had.   Instead, at times it feels like a simple math exercise. 

Yes, the artwork, while pretty, is as non-functional as most people accuse it of being.

Differing victory point goals force players to compete for their own interests, and the movement restrictions around the board means it's not always easy to hit the leader without a concerted team effort, which can be odds with their own goals. This is one of the prime attractions for me in a big meat game, the ability to define and implement strategy so that it's not in other player's interests to over-compete with you and turn it into a mindless slug-fest. There are lots of difficult decisions throughout on where and how to resource your efforts. Especially clever is the linkage beteen armies and resources, how they beget each other. Great match to theme, different from other games. Thumbs up.

While there were elements of this game that I enjoyed, overall it is definitely my cup of tea. All of the players must be equally experienced for this game to have any type of play-balance at all, and the learning curve - with the fifteen distinct phases and tricky to remember rules - makes this most unlikely for my group of players. Also, the historical period and events recreated here - the dutch reformation - is not something I find very exciting.

I will NEVER be able to find anyone to play this with, as not only is the European history thing not something anyone I associate with is into, is way too-niche of a topic to attract anyone.

RATING: 9
This is a great game. Some of the rules seem to be lifted from Civilization (conflict resolution, the pool of shared resource/money tokens), but it plays very differently. The different factions have well-balanced different goals, as well as differences in foreign support, army costs, and influencing the public. While no two players are put into direct conflict with each others over their goals (other than the control of provinces and cities, which is a generic goal for all players), there are natural alliances between some factions.

The rules are pretty straight-forward. We had some minor rules issues, but in all cases, our initial gut feeling was correct. It is well structured, although it takes a while to remember the order of the almost 20 phases in a turn (but a player aid is provided for that). All in all a great game that seems to have great replayability from the differences in the factions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game system is actually fairly well done to incorporate multiple events from history without the game feeling like a series of exception-based rules. However, the down time in immense while you try and count up the various cities and points and other random scoring "trivia" each turn. Would perhaps be interesting if it lasted about 1/4 as long.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: Raised it from 7 to 9.

It's actually a lot like Struggle of Empires: It's a war game with a significant economic element. You have two kinds of units: influence units that you use to gain control of areas on the board for points and resources, and army units that are used to attack those influence units but do not directly contribute to controlling areas.

The biggest differences, and why I think Revolution is better than Struggle of Empires:

* Revolution has far better integration of theme, including asymmetrical (yet seemingly balanced) factions to control
* Revolution has zero luck or hidden information

-----

The board: It's both good and bad. Although there's the problem that some provinces are so small that just one counter won't fit into it, those provinces are relatively unimportant.

The counters themselves are meant to be placed in stacks, so there's enough room for everybody in the larger (and more important) provinces.

We actually play influence tokens with the money side up since they are easier to differentiate like that; it makes no difference in game play.

Yes, it's atrocious trying to find cities and towns on the map, there's ways to get around it.  For example, when determining whether you control the cities and towns listed on your cards, it's easier to look on the board *first*, then look to see if that city or town is on your card.

=====

Tentative 7 for one play, four players, five hours.

Minus one point for the beautiful yet horribly designed board. It's just way too small for the size of the pieces, and what players have to do with the pieces. Throughout the game, the number of counters of each area must be counted, and this value changes depending on whether a counter is occupying a city, a town, or neither, but the board design makes this hard to do. Thus, it's difficult to assess the outcome of a conflict; one usually ends up having to recount counters over and over.

Need to play again; mechanics are so integrated with each other; we only figured out basic strategy during turn 5. Odd mechanism that money and influence markers are represented with the same, double sided counter, meaning that spending money generally means more influence markers available, which means that players can start playing aggressively much earlier than expected.

Beginner players should be reminded about the basic tactics of how influence markers may -- and may not -- be played on the board (through support boxes, overflow, influence via army units, and buying citizen influence) since these tactics are not readily apparent.

Beginners should also know the basic tactics to lock up countries and prevent anyone from getting in. For example, there's a limit of the number of influence tokens two or more faction may have in a province. However, if there's only one faction in it, there is no limit, which essentially allows you to "lock" the province. There are other tactics to watch out for; because we didn't realize this, we were a bit frustrated during the last phases of the game. Warning players about this might alleviate the complaints that some felt about the game feeling "static" near the end.

The biggest fault of this game is the amount of bookkeeping, and the bad board design of this game worsens this issue.

Would like to play again, but somebody needs to redraw this horrible map.

RATING: 8
Each player seat needs to focus on the core way to earn vp as well as the particular way in which they can.  Also since the points are of almost no consequence (other than turn order) until the last turn, players will need to play to the resources that they need: either guilders, political influence or military (to a second degree).  It seems that around the mid-game the engine the sides make will become more solidified and less alterable.   

The map and play does get slightly more intuitive at three plays, the remainder of this comment is prior to my third and full play of the game. 

If you are geographically very familiar with the location of the cities your game will go (much) faster.  I can better identify with comments I've read concerning the small, cryptic font for this reason.  A play aid that helps show the location of the cities would be a welcome addition to my copy that I will probably make.  Also the color of the pieces is just a tad close; I may put a marker line across all the black pieces to help see the Neutrals at very least or paint the sides an appropriate color and finish the edges preferably.  The chits are very nice and large, but certain provinces don't have enough room to display them easily - there will be a fair amount of 'stack browsing'.

There are several very well designed layers that meld so nicely together that its easy to recognize that there is a gem of a game to be learned here.  If I where to make a guess I'd say my rating will be going up a couple points after deeper studies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very interesting multi-player game.  It makes a serious effort to regulate inter-player diplomacy by restricting the ability of players to interact in particular ways.  Each faction has a fairly different feel, and the games I have played so far have felt chaotic (a good thing) despite the lack of explicit randomizers.  There are a few rules ambiguities: none big enough to derail the game, but annoying in a game that seems well thought-out and tested  The finish has usually been close for at least a couple of factions. Takes us about 4 hours to play with 4 players.

Hard to give a representative rating after one played game. Or wait ... our group didn't play the whole game. We stopped in round 2 (!) after 6 (!) hours! Although we love complex games this one has several strange rules and is played very roughly. The downtime isn't the big problem but nevertheless duration and unclearness of the game are disturbing the game flow. I take my hat off to Francis Tresham for his theme research but I also have to say: the game is very exhausting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unusually chromey Tresham, that plays like a shorter but more complex Civilisation (the combat system and the population / money mechanism are both present). It's a little bit too fiddly for my tastes (VPs go to two decimal places!), but the core game is solid and the theme is interesting. The components are beautiful but could be more functional, especially the board which is difficult to read.

Anyway, a good game, that will take you the same time to get through as a game of 1830. For me, that's 4 to 4.5 hours. Should become quicker and more enjoyable with further play.

RATING: 9
It's a really marvellous game with sometimes too much to think about.

The first time none of the players knew the rules, so during play we "learned" how to play. After about 4 hours we arrived at the end of turn 1. So on how the game evolves during all 5 turns, I can't say anything, but for as far as I've played the game, I can say for sure it's really the most complicated boardgame I've ever seen/played.

One word: SUPERB!!

Difficult game to rate. I love the idea of it and the actual sequence of play is not as complex as it first appears. However, the difficulty of finding stuff on the map and distinguishing where units sit (in cities or towns or the countryside) can make some of the gameplay rather turgid. It may be possible to seriously pimp this to make it more playable - there's certainly a very fine game in there. BUT - be aware that unless players are prepared to immerse themselves in the rules and come prepared for the game, they may well struggle to enjoy this.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] 3 player game and 4 player game. Outstanding game components. Very different historical game that really is no more of a wargame than Wallenstein, instead it is a game of political control with slight wargame elements. I liked it, and although there's significant initial investment to learn all the rules and phases, it plays fairly easily after that.

The strategies are quite deep I think, and we probably only scratched the surface in our 3 player test run. 5-6 hours for the first game is not an unreasonable expectation. My tolerance for super long games increases when I am getting plenty of games/month, but in the last two years, my gaming time has been more limited.

Most recent play 3-25-11 with Michael, Garrett and Donovan.

Woah.  I think of all the games that I've played this game has the steepest learning curve.  Overall, I think that the game is sound but the level intensity of rules referencing and FAQing, trying to grog all of the conditions for everything, make this game a little bit slow and quite a chore to get going.  That said, once everything clicks there is a really good game here.

Even when the game starts to run smoothly there are a thousand different chits moving and attention is needed to sort out each region.  There are so many different machinations here that only the most dedicated gamer is going to enjoy this.  That said I do enjoy it.

I suspect that the game will go up with more plays, my only fear is that there will always be a new player trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

Oh yeah, the font sucks, but after a turn or two you know what you need to do.

UPDATE: With the help of the great play aids here and some experience under my belt I find myself adoring this game.  It is long and has a thousand different turn sequences, but the results are an overwhelmingly engaging game.  Well worth the investment that it takes to grock this.

An interesting take on an underused theme. I like the Civ-style combat, and the array of diverse mechanisms available to aid expansion. The map was somewhat fussy to use, though, since it contains a lot of information used throughout the game, and there are so many tokens on it that much time is spent shifting tokens around trying to find this town or that population limit value.

After a few years sitting on my shelf, I've finally managed to get it played. Our 3-player (2 newbies) learning game obviously lacked some of the potential for alliances and negotiation, but still felt meaty & a great way to spend about 5 hours.

Revolution is an area-majorities game lusciously painted on a large scale. Factions have asymmetrical starting situations, abilities & objectives. Plenty to consider, plenty to learn. Keen to play again soon.

Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.

Good, sort of like a combination of [gameid=17392] and [gameid=71], though not quite as good as either.  Lots of juicy choices, and it certainly isn't too simple.  The time actually playing is pretty quick for this type of game, but the rules are fraught with odd exceptions that don't always make sense.  For instance, armies in cities under siege don't count for province limits, but do count for replacement purposes, but can't be moved, but do count for control of cities...  There are a lot of little weird rules like this to just memorize, which is unfortunate, because trying to explain it to new players can be very confusing.  When you get past that, the game is very tight and well-balanced.  

I'm a little bit disappointed by some of the gamey-ness that can sometimes come up, at the expense of some of the history.  I'm no expert on the period, but there are some shenanigans that are very important from a gameplay strategy standpoint, but seem artificial.  I feel that the application of the razor blade of simplicity was juuuust a little bit too liberal, and the theme sometime suffers.  It could be that there's just not enough history included with the rules, and thus there is an explanation for some of this gameyness.  I would have loved to see some GMT-style designer's notes.  Alas, what might have been.

It's not that the rules are horrendously complex, but there are clarity issues due to the obscure artwork that  exacerbate an already steep learning curve. It isn't really until you've played a full game and already KNOW where the cities are that things will go smoothly. That being said, Revolution is a brilliant game with so much to think about as there are a myriad of ways to influence the state of the board. Planning ahead is critical as encroachments into new areas are slow to develop- accomplishing a particular goal can take several game turns. The different factions have very different positions so playing one versus another is almost a completely different game experience- a big plus for repeat plays. In the end, the inaccessibility of the game might prevent it from really seeing the repeat plays it deserves (and requires to really make the investment worthwhile). Finding the right group to tackle this is a daunting task.

What is really needed is a few playings of the game to really appreciate the depth of choices and strategies available.  Even reading the rules and playing once won't do it justice.  It takes one or two games to even get a feel for what's going on.  Overall, a very good gamer's game.

We are developing a pool of experienced players to play with and look forward to playing 5 player games with all experienced players to get the full effect of the game. VERY intricate and subtle game mechanics and subsystems make it a tough learn for those lacking patience or expecting a "play and learn" game.

This is going to take a lot of time to learn.  Probably the toughest game I own.

First game played - 5 of us and it took 8 hours. Differenct aims for each player adds excellent dimension. We played with lots of negotiation but I would be interested to see how it plays without. I think this game will grow even better the more you play it.

The mechanics may seem clunky at the beginning, but after some 2 turns things become clear. There are variable player powers and goals, which I like vey much and, in general, this game deserves credit for sticking to the actual history as much as possible without ruining the gameplay. A fine title.

Tough to rate this game.  Its a unique, good game, but according to the BGG scale I should actually be rating this a 3/10 - because I likely won't play this a second time.    It is just too long and engrossing.  Learning this game is hard work, like reading poorly written research results in an unfamiliar field.  The lettering is hard to grasp, there is tons going on, and the rules are quite unclear.  But it is also the kind of game that after a session you will not forget.

Great game once we were able to get the rules down by turn 2 or 3. Lot of strategy to explore here. Each faction has a lot do throughout the game. Played with 4 would like to try with 5. Will wait to rate after another playing.

Games a bit long for my preference. (about 6 hrs) But if you want a long, complex, multiplayer game this is one of the best...

Wonderful game! So much going on. So many choices, strategies, deals to make. Very deep game, but not hard at all to learn. Going to play this one often. Our first session was a 4 player game that lasted three hours, till the end of turn 3....not bad at all for playing time, learning the rules (we had to call the game...t'was getting late)

Impresionante juego con sabor histórico. De mecánica no excesivamente compleja pero profundo. Entre 3 y 5 horas

Takes some effort to play this.  First off, it requires several players, the rules take some learning due to the large number of phases, it is a bit long, and the theme doesn't sound that exciting.  In addition, the rulebook would really benefit from an extended example of play, it is often hard to find places on the map, and the counters can be hard to distinguish with a quick glance.  Despite all this, this is an excellent area control game with lots of historical theme.  It is a very good blend of politics, religious struggles, battles and sieges, and economics.  The game mechanics are really quite smooth once you learn them.  The play is exciting.  Seriously consider this game if you enjoy Twilight Struggle and the COIN series.

07/13/09 -- 2nd game was frustrating.  We ran into a rule ambiguity (what to do with sieging armies if all of the command block spaces have been filled during army movement) that derailed the game for some time.  The poor ergonomics of the board and pieces also reared its ugly head in causing us to miscount a crucial conflict.  We subsequently planned some ground rules for handling pieces, but it was too late by then for the game we were playing.  We ended up aborting the game after turn 3 in favor of Dune.  Interest remains, however, and I feel it's too soon to rate.  Cooperation between the natural allies was increased over the first game.  Hopefully we'll get in another game in the next few weeks.

6/29/09 -- Positive response to first game.  Franny seems to address many of the common weaknesses of multi-player war-type games, which I'm glad to see someone take on.  Game also has a lot of the same degrees of abstraction as Civilization, which is good though don't ask me to explain what it means.

I like what the game tries to do, but it uses too many rules to achieve that goal. A lot of bookkeeping. "Count every resource, in provinces, in towns, in cities. Unless besieged." 2 phases later: "Count all resources again. Leave all resources in cities out." And "Count all towns with a resource of you. Count all resources in all provinces, divide those by 5, round down and add the number of towns." Argh!

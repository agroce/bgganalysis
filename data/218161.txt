Rating based on 1 play of 3 x 2 player teams.
Fun race against each other game that it is exciting and gives some of the feel of a pit crew working on a car and the resulting race.

RATING: 8
Light but very fun, this is Speed: the actual game. The fact that you play over multiple rounds keeps the tension in it, and the team mode is SUPER fun (2v2, or even 3v3!) and allows the game to scale to 9 players while not actually taking any longer.

Frantic real-time gem that clocks in at filler length. I'm a huge fan of games that form players up in teams, and this one works well as you're yelling at each other and trying to manage your independent hands to properly place cards onto your car mat. A great deal of fun and very unique.

RATING: 8
This did everything good a board game is supposed to do on the first play and it was one the best first play experiences I've had in a long time....A month or 2 on though and I've never really been sparked to take it back off my shelf. Will probably hang onto it though as it can fit into any time slot up to about half an hour and you're definitely engaged/having fun in that time. I'm chalking that lack of spark to me just being excited/motivated to play other things for various reasons and I'm expecting it to shine again next time I take it out. Compares to Escape in frantic co op multiplayer, but where I find Escape to be too easy (have never played the expansions but that might be too much symbology overhead for such a simple game), this is as competitive as the people you are playing with and so is more rewarding in that sense. 

edit: got the spark back. It shines. This is a real winner and a good one to break up any sort of thinky exp with or get people excited about playing games. It has never failed to uplift the mood of the table or end a brainy night on a good note.

Pit Crew is a fast & furious real time speed solitaire card game from the co-designer of Space Cadets, and it shows in the gameplay, but also pales in comparison to Space Cadets after a play or two. 

There are two phases to the game: Pit Crew and Race phase.

Pit Crew Phase: card play orbits a series of set collection "minigames" each round with identical team decks of 40 numbered cards (two sets each of black 1-10 and white 1-10 number cards) played around each team's race car playmat. Each playmat is an overhead view of a stock car with a number on the roof, four different numbers next to each of the four tires, and (after Round ) 1 symbols by the engine that look like chromosome pairings ("XX," or "XX YY" etc.). Each of these areas require different set collecting objectives.

Race Phase: Teams are represented by wooden race car meeples on a small oval racetrack board. They are moved around the track during scoring based on accuracy and speed - or lack thereof. Bonuses and penalties are tallied at the end of each round and cars moved accordingly. After three rounds, the car in the lead wins.

Pit Crew Phase: Team decks are shuffled and each player on the team is dealt a hand of cards (variable based on player count). Then the game starts (green flag not included). 

In real time, with no fixed order, players play cards onto their race car tableau to gather specific kinds of card sets depending on what part of the car they play to. The general rule of carding is "play one, draw one." Though when things speed up you'll often be short-handed from multiple lightning card plays and be drawing multiples at a time. Discards are legal anytime when needed but will ding you in scoring (see below).

In the game you replicate pit crews fixing the race cars (via cards) with the fundamentals: Tires, Fuel Tank, and Engine. 

"Tires" is step solitaire where you must place four cards per tire in a step-up or step-down number sequence: "8, 7, 8, 9" for example. Each tire has a different starting number value that starts the sequencing. Cards values roll over so "10, 1, 10, 9" is equally valid. 

"Fuel" is playing cards that add up exactly (or as close to) the number on the roof of the car. You can go over or under, but this penalizes you during scoring (see below). 

"Engine" is playing a pair of matching number cards "XX." In later rounds teams will play multiple pairs of different numbers for each pair. 

When you complete tire, fuel, or engine sets - or you get close enough and just want to finish with incomplete sets, which is allowed - you place a corresponding cap card over the tire, engine, or fuel tank to signify that you're "locking" the set and that no more cards will be played on it. Once you cap all sets on the car for the round, you are done for that round and may enter the "bonus die" phase.

Bonus Die in Pit Crew Phase: Cars are moved on the track during the Pit Crew Phase for qualifying teams (aka those that have capped all their car sets with at least one other team still actively playing cards). Once capped, qualifying teams continuously roll a 6-sided die over and over while the other teams speed to finish their own cars. Every "6" results in your moving your race car meeple forward one space on the racetrack. There is one less bonus die available than total teams, so bonus dies are available to all but the "last" team each round. Bonus rolling occurs until the last team of the round caps all their sets, then the Pit Crew phase is over.

Race Phase: Teams now review their tableaus - the four tire sequences, fuel tank total, and engine pair/s. Errors made - unfinished sets, misplayed cards, or discards - result in penalty points. Other teams move their cards forward one space per penalty point accrued. Tires: teams are penalized for each out-of-sequence card (1 pt) and being short of the four cards-per-tire requirement (2 pts). Fuel Tanks: teams are given a penalty point for each tick away from the target number they are. Engines: each missing or incorrect card counts as 2 points each. Discards: every two discarded cards equal 1 penalty point. 

If a team's total amount of penalty points in any given round equals or exceeds 8 points, then the car has "crashed" and that team is eliminated from the game.

Finally, teams can score Turbo Bonuses which is 1) having a complete & "perfect" set that 2) uses all number cards of the same color. This is a two-point move forward on the racetrack for each Turbo Bonus, and it can be assessed for each of the different sets on the car. So a team that Turbos all of their four tires, their fuel tank, and engine. would gain 12 spaces forward on the track. 

If this game feels fiddly, sloppy, and messy, that's because it is. But it's also a ten-minute ride. That said, Pit Crew is not necessarily something I need to play again, nor something I think that would be vastly more enjoyable with more players. There is zero interaction among the competing teams; it's just a quasi-Spit or speed solitaire race to finish sets with as few errors as possible. There is chaos with placing cards down but nothing that seems too contentious with the teams playing cards. There's no urgency necessarily in card playing. There's no restrictions against showing your hands nor table talk, so that mitigates the chaos of playing cards to the point where the Pit Crew phase is rote sorting and less chaotic-feeling. 

And this is all from the designer of Space Cadets, which has chaos, cooperation, and a fog of war in spades. So this is a game that should know better. Instead Pit Crew just had me pining for that SC. 

Pit Crew is a sloppier, messier, cutting-room floor microgame version of Space Cadets. In Space Cadets teams all engaged in solitaire minigames but it was at the behest of a team, of one spaceship moving, fighting, and completing tasks where all players lived or died by the players' speed and accuracy or lack thereof. There was more joy involved, even - and especially - when things inevitably went wrong. There's no stakes at all in Pit Crew to laugh about or share. And it feels more abstract thematically so you never feel like your car is falling apart on the track because of bad pit crew maintenance. 

And the other real-time chaos games I can think of all do something better thematically and with the Fun Factor than Pit Crew: Mountains of Madness, Captain Sonar, Space Cadet: Dice Duels, Space Alert, Magic Maze, Dungeon Time, and Galaxy Trucker - to name a bunch. 

Pit Crew feels like one of those games that might be fun for rarely-boardgaming families as a gateway. Or if I received it as a BGG Secret Santa gift I wouldn't regift it. 
Thankfully the game lasts a scant 10-15 minutes. But as noted there are other fun speed card games that work so much better, and far better fillers.

チーム戦で行うスピード。
課題をクリアしたら相手が課題をクリアするまでサイコロを振り続けて車を進めるというのが秀逸。
数学が二色あり、同色であればボーナスで2マス進めるため、ピットインのスピードと質を天秤にかけつつわちゃわちゃやるのが楽しい。また、あえて成り立たないカードを出して、ピットインを素早く終わらせてもいい。ペナルティを受けることにはなるが、相手がピットインを終えるまでサイコロを振り続けられるので、それ以上に6が出れば問題ないのだ。単純なアイデアだけど、よく出来てる。

Fun, against the clock real time game based on little more than sets of cards numbered 1-10. Building simple sequences, pairs and counting to 27 (or higher in later rounds) may seem like simple tasks, but doing them in a time-pressured environment makes them otherwise!

I'm into the recent speed game co-op trend, and this team version seems to be hitting all the right pistons. I love how, instead of fearing mistakes, it encourages you to consider the cost of mistakes, and sometimes, make them on purpose when the reward of finishing early outweighs the penalty.

This is the first game I've ever encountered where I could make it for cheaper than MSRP at a Kinko's. While a solid game I'm, unprecedented for me in past reviews, giving this a lower score purely because of component quality and not design merit. I enjoy board games partly because of their physical nature, and am not a fan of the disposible model Stronghold adopted from Hasbro. Use tiles for the cars and track cards  next time without upping the already high price.

Pit Crew shines when played with teams.  The chaotic, real-time, team dynamic provides a fun and unique experience.   Head-to-head, it's just OK as a speed game.  The presentation is typical of Stronghold Games: mediocre.

This game feels like a combination of Yahtzee, Miles Bourne and Slapjack.

Supposedly much better than Captain Sonar.
CONCLUSIONS: Pit Crew is a fast paced and tense filler that offers the unique combination of something very thematic, competitive, cooperative, and real-time in a package that is relatively small and simple. The team game play works well, and yet the game is very competitive as well. Playing speedily due to the real-time simultaneous play makes the action fast and frantic, but at the same time you also need to play smart, and have some sense of what cards have already been played and what is still needed.

RECOMMENDATION: Pit Crew only lasts around 15-20 minutes, which is perfect for its size. As such, this fairly small box packs more horse-power than most games its size. Sure, you’ll occasionally think you’re breathing in some petrol fumes while you’re playing, and a game can be a frantic exercise – but isn’t that one of the highest compliments a thematic game like this could receive? - BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame

I heard the SU&SD guys casually refer to this as a portable, filler version of Galaxy Trucker and instantly ordered it.  By the time I got it and got it to the table they elaborated on it more in a future episode as being ugly and not very fun.  Sadly I have to agree.  It's fun enough for the panic of it all, but there's something not very satisfying about watching your race cars move forward a few spots each turn.  I wish it had more of a race feel.  The frantic dice chucking to get a 6 when you finish first is great, but it's not enough.

Enjoyable once you get the hang of it. Definately needs 8+ people to be interesting.

Good filler, although you need a bit of a poker face to hide which team you are on or role you are playing.

是個陣營遊戲，個人覺得沒有比阿瓦隆差，甚至更歡樂。

唯一個缺點是登高一呼實在太威...

A nice improvement for a somewhat lame version of the game that we are playing in our group, rarely. I will get me a localized version of this game when it comes out. Mos def!

Never played. Seems fun. Might never get it to the table due to large group requirement and relatively fiddly rules.

This game is seriously amazing. It's like WereWolf, but in more strategic. You can switch your character with other players so you're aways in the action. The things that can happen in the game are very fun and very diversified. Give it a try ! It's a little bit complicated at first, but after 1 or 2 games, everybody is used to the special characters and it becomes very interesting.

Another Mafia/Werewolf variant, with a theme based on my favorite novel. The theme surely adds some flavor to the game, at least to me. Like other Mafia/Werewolf variants, it must work better with a large group.

In the mode of Resistance and Werewolf, everyone is given a secret character. On a turn you can peek at someone's character, or swap characters around. There's 2 assassins, one Sultan and two guards, and a bunch of slaves and neutrals. The aim is generally to find and become an assassin, hope nothing changes by the time it gets back to your turn, hope that you know who the guards are (because if one's next to you, or next to your target, they'll kill you instead) and then kill off a guard or the sultan. Or vice versa, be a goodie and find and kill off the assassins. If you're on the winning team when one team's been killed off, you score points. Play 5 rounds. So it's a game of luck (you find good characters or not) and a game of role tracking - once you've peeked at and found an interesting character, track where it goes. But whether you find relevant information and whether you can use it or not ... both are a lottery. The game makes it tricky to get into accusation mode. It can easily backfire as there's usually not enough info to know whether your team is in a winning position - it depends a lot on whether the guards are situated adjacent to assassins or not. It's an experience / party type game for gamers who like the genre and fancy trying something a bit different - it won't be a staple because there's just not enough info to work with, and other games in this mode are more interesting, but we've had some decent fun with it nonetheless.

An interesting premise that didn't quite work for me. I like the hidden roles and the looking and trading of cards, the lies and half truths as you try and find out who you can trust, only for the cards to move around and allegiances change.

It's honestly less chaotic than it sounds and with 6 players, I could often work out who everyone was fairly quickly, but the difficulty comes in putting yourself in a position to score from it, without being excluded.

And in this aspect the game almost fails. The scoring is a little over complicated (based only on 1 play) and feels a little like Vlaada Chvatil on an off-day. A nice game with messy scoring.

There is also a chance where you can be left without any choices as cards are revealed and the turn order damns you which is a little disappointing.

In summary: promising, but far from perfect.

Fun hidden role game, although it can be difficult to get your head around some of the strategy involved since roles can be swapped.

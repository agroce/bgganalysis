Lovely backstabbing, headline grabbing newspaper game from Germany. If you think that all journalists are scumbags, here is your chance to prove it. As far as I know, it only comes in the German version, although with English rules included. 
If you take the time to change the headlines from German to English (make some of your own, as the German humour often doesn't translate) it adds to the fun. I really like this one.

I like the concept that your player board is two blank pages of a newspaper that need to be filled with stories coming in over the fax.  Having chosen your story for the turn, you then decide how many column inches to devote to it, restricted by available space on your board.  Time pressure is nicely handled by chit draws that move the clock towards midnight.  

There's interaction in the form of bidding to place adverts or cancel stories in an opponent's paper and in competition to have the most impressive section and the biggest coverage of a story.  You really have to watch your opponents closely.  

The end game scoring is  a bit long-winded (a whole two and a half page appendix is dedicated to an example).  Production quality and artwork are just adequate.

It's not the greatest, but I really like the theme, the physical layout of the paper, and the time clock/fax machine mechanic.  A bit long and kind of "dated" gameplay-wise, but still very original.

Made it to the table after 15 years on the shelf and an evening assembling English language bits courtesy of the Geek.  Well worth the effort.  Lots of nice ideas - the cheques, timing and scoring mechanisms, plenty of influence - a bit 'in your face' for some I expect.  A real gem that I look forward to playing again.

Update: Looks like Penny Press may be the updated version I was looking for. Most promising? Asmadi Games has picked it up.

Some interesting mechanics, for sure. Feels more modern than its pre-Settlers publication would imply. But like most Schmiel games, the mechanics are bolted on in odd places, resulting in a Frankensteinian concoction that ultimately doesn't satisfy.

An updated version of this game with more elegant mechanics could be [i]really[/i] cool.

What a cool game.  It wasn't hard to teach and learn but boy, I can see there are a bunch of ways to maximize your points and make sure that everyone is reading your bed wetter story.  Even without English pasteups, the titles were still funny!  Not that long, either...it moves along nicely.

Wanted to like it, expected to like it.  Unfortunately, in my first play there seemed to be a huge amount of luck as far as when story titles came out, without many options for mitigating that luck.  Wouldn't mind playing it one more time to see whether I missed something, but I'd also be fine with not playing it again.

I can see where this might have been innovative when it came out in 1991, but 20 years later I do not find much to recommend it.  It is a decent tile positioning and blocking game, but it feels ponderous and I find myself losing interest half-way through the game.

RATING: 8
Ah, another super obscure Schmiel game, and this one is delightful, if decidedly lighter than his magnum opus Die Macher. In this game, players take the role of newspaper editors, which essentially entails trying to fill their own paper up with fat stories late in the day, while also taking time to waste space in the opposition's paper with ads, or by dropping the ever dangerous duck tiles onto their stories, which indicate that those stories are bogus, completely destroying their point value.

The game has a lot of moving parts, and as seems to be typical for earlier German games, and particularly Schmiel games, the scoring system is a tad convoluted. The play itself is actually pretty straight forward though, and has a lot of interesting options. Players have to be careful with their story tile allotment so that they can make the best use of their board, preferably cramming it to the gills with a large sections in a few of the 6 colours, while carefully reserving space for the biggest stories during the late part of the game, as late-breaking stories score more points that earlier ones. As you might be able to tell, like Macher, the theme actually fits the game well in this case, and it adds measurably to the game experience.

I really dig this game, and I think it's a shame that the price is so ridiculous. This is another game that absolutely begs for a reprint, but its obscurity makes me think that that will be very unlikely. A real shame, this is another top tier title from Schmiel and deserves to be something more than a cult favourite.

Warning: this is for people who like a bit of "screw you" in their games only. The mechanics compel 12 direct screw you moments that can vastly mess up player boards or destroy the value of stories. I love it, and the swings are part of the game, but people who like games a tad friendlier might be turned off by this.

Finally got around to playing this game. I had a very good time playing it. You are the editor of a newspaper. You have to layout your newspaper with articles of 6 different kinds, business, sports and so on. You interact with the other players by interfering with their papers by placing ads in their paper and by scooping them by having better coverage on stories than they do. There are numerous things to watch for. How to lay out your sections, which articles to run with and how much space to give them. Overall a very satisfying game. Sold this game. Too many new ones not enough time.

I've only played it once, and my highschool German didn't allow me to know what was on most of the tiles.  Still, the game itself is fun.  I think if it had been played nastier it would have been less fun, or perhaps a different kind of fun (but one that I would have to be in the mood for).

RATING: 6
The beginning of the game was a little boring.  We just kept selecting articles for our papers.  It got a little spicier once we started selecting timers...as the screwage went up.  But I don't think there was enough there to warrant buying it.  I'd probably play it if someone suggested it; although I wouldn't be overly excited to do so.  One recommendation, I think a good idea for teaching this game should include a practice "end-of-game" scoring.  I won the game I played, but didn't even realize how well I was doing because I didn't fully understand the scoring mechanism.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game where players are newspaper editors trying to scoop the opposition with their newspaper layout.  Players select stories "off the wire" and commit a certain size of their layout to it.  The circulation numbers (ie. VP's) are awarded for majorities within story, section and front page area.  The fun part comes with clobbering your opponents papers with escort agency advertisments.  Excellent game.

RATING: 6
A vicious stock-competition game. The  two main mechanisms of the game - drafting stories and bidding for trashing opponenets papers - are both well-balanced.

RATING: 7
The game offers a well-balanced and unique take on area control (in a relative sense) with an interesting tile drafting element. You're competing with each other for the biggest article size, and articles placed closer to the deadline will score more. This duality adds a layer in competing for article size; some are more worth fighting for than others.

It's a dickish game because you nuke opponents' articles and make them worthless. I nuked two of my neighbor's articles which enabled me to tie him. Basically, you just throw a bunch of stuff at the editorial wall and hope that most of it sticks, understanding that all of it won't. You make yourself a big target and people are going to mess with you.

The process for attempting to mess with each other is a wonderfully balanced closed economy whereby you each trade one of three checks you start with. You might start off winning your challenges but this means you'll have lower checks in hand for later in the game.  And those extra turn markers, while helpful, won't help you protect yourself from being nuked if you don't have a big check in hand to play as people get a sense of who they are in competition with for the same article, so the blind bidding balances itself.

I made my own headlines taken from The Onion which made playing the game even more fun. “Plan To Get Laid At DragonCon 2001 Fails”

I love the theme and the flavor of interaction.  It plays at a good clip and it's always tense competing for the various majorities. A lot of direct screwage, but in a way that limits how much an individual player can be picked on in addition to giving one a lot of control over player incentives.  

Even if this ever gets reprinted I'll still recommend the original.  It's too much fun butchering the German headlines.

A recent revisiting of Extrablatt reveals that the game hasn't aged quite as well as Schmiel's other top tier games (Die Macher and Was Sticht).  But it's still refreshingly different than any other game I've played.  And still by far the best of all the games about newspaper editors. ;) A good English language edition with appropriately absurd headlines would make the game quite a bit more enjoyable.  Maybe I'll try to Anglicize my copy's headline tiles.

Ouch. Super cool game with a fun theme but screwage galore. I'm surprised more people don't know about this and that someone in the states didn't pick it up. The general populace in the US is so enamored with celebrity, this would be an easy game to theme for it. Instead of a serious newspaper with politics, sports, business, etc...it could all be about celebrities and their botox injections and public spats with other celebrities.

I delayed playing this due to wanting to create English pasteups.  Now that I've played it I realize that they aren't essential at all, just a bit of fun.  Anyhow, the game is good but not great.  First of all, I strongly dislike blind bidding and the luck of the tile draws when a row is emptied and refilled is big. Players are afraid to take the last tile in a row sometimes! Plus the game has a LOT of pieces floating around and it's just kind of a pain. There's definitely a lot of strategic value to the game however after playing just once I don't know what they are exactly.  If you get the chance definitely try te game out but don't overpay for it as I did (mostly due to shipping from Germany)

**UPDATE**  When I heard that this was being reprinted I jumped and sold my copy, eager to get the English version. It's been two years and we're still waiting, and with little confidence that it will actually materialize.

A great theme, a lot of fun, and quite vicious, almost too mean.  A well-placed ad or duck can really hurt someone's plans.  There's a lot of things going on and you really have to keep your eyes open, watching for moves that your opponents may be making.  This is made difficult by all the German text.  One problem is that it's tough to judge who's winning, as all the scoring takes place at the end and you basically have to guess when it comes time to mess up your neighbor's paper.

I finally tracked down a copy of this game, and I'm glad I did.  In some ways this game shows its age.  there are LOTS of components, and despite what the box says, expect to play this for 2.5 hours.  Nonetheless, I was entirely entertained the whole time.  The spatial aspect of laying out the newspaper is interesting, so is the competition for the headlines, and the competiton over the use of the time markers is innovative.

I decided it would be more fun to have English headlines, so I created a whole new set.  Further, I decided to make the headlines a bit bigger, as I found the narrow tiles provided with the game very difficult to shuffle.  So the new headlines do require you to create slightly bigger tiles.  The new headlines are available as the "Collection" file.  I used Excel '97 as an easy way to set the width of the jpg images.

Definitely need to play some more, but this can be quite the brain burner to get your arms around scoring and strategy.

One of the most uniquely themed games I know of.   Best (and probably only with) four plyrs.  Wow, simply fabulous...  Many strategies and layers to think about and keep in mind, leading to final scoring that is predominantly uncertain (best guess at best) until the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unique twist to a game that really creates a good bit of tension by the end of the game as you seek to develop majorites in the different story lines, different subject areas, and fill out your front page.  Add in some nasty twists with advertisements (they can be really nasty early in the game if placed strategically near the front page) or with "ducks" in the late game which cancel out stories and it becomes quite fun.  I'd love to see an English version come out sometime.

It's a majorities game which at least has a bit of class due to a great theme, applying stories into the different sections of your newspaper to win in sports, news, etc. I don't enjoy the blind bidding duels aspect though, which seems just a bit too important in the scheme of things for this kind of mechanic. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love the concept of this game, but find the execution somewhat lacking.  You're trying to fill your newspaper grid with a number of different stories of various sizes.  You get points for the age of your story (the later in the game you play it, the more it's worth), as well as bonus points for having the largest of various sections (sports section, etc.).  The catch is, your stories don't count if someone else has a larger story with the same headline.  Between trying to keep track of how large each of each players' sections are and trying to keep track of who has what headlines and which are larger than the others, there's really more staring at opponents' boards than actually playing the game.  Additionally, there's an element of blind-bidding-style direct confrontation which I found distasteful.

I love modern-day themes, and filling a newspaper front-page with articles and photos is a much better fit for a spatial placement, individual player-board Euro than the usual tedious palazzo-building! I also really like the way the game throws a wrench in the careful individual planning by allowing you to buy adverts for call-girls and dump them in the middle of your opponents' layouts!

The rules are a little clunky in some ways and the graphic design is pretty spartan (not that I mind), but on the whole Extrablatt feels amazingly modern for a game published in 1991. Drafting, area majority, auctions - all present and correct. Schmiel was way ahead of his time.

This is a good game.  The paper layout really matters.  In many games of this type, the layout is not really very tricky (e.g. Princes of Florence most times) but here a small error can come back to haunt you.  A majorities game when all is said and done, but so cleverly disguised that you often forget that fact.  We end the game when the clock strikes 12, otherwise you can get into a protracted standoff over final hoax fights.  Would be more fun with English headlines and better graphics.  Has a reputation for being complex but is actually very straight forward.

Like Acquire, you are trying to score in the top two of different colors, in this case newspaper sections.  Acquire has mergers which can alter plans.  In Extrablatt you can directly influence your opponents and drastically alter their plans.  I haven't finished a complete game yet.  My initial impression is that if you like games with a more vicious style you will probably enjoy this one.  It's usually not my style, plus I'm geometrically challenged, so I don't clearly see some of the more obvious moves.  For those reasons, I don't think it will rank high for me.  However, I'll give it another chance before assigning a rating.  Update:  played a full game and I like the way the scoring works.  However, the game is  bit too fiddly for my taste for what it is and takes too long.  Games like Acquire or Get The Goods accomplish similar objectives in a much simpler, streamlined fashion, without much of the "take that" element.  There is also some downtime between turns that further detracts from the fun factor.

It didn't grab my attention. I find it boring. Some of the mechanics don't sem to work very well. I have to play it again though.

I think this game should be played understanding the language because although it's not that language dependant it sure uses language to distinguish news (not only colors) and some of the fun of the game is on the news themselves.

I'd wanted to play Extrablatt for a long time, so I was glad to finally manage a game of it. The end game scoring is, unsurprisingly, pretty key and the game would help immensely if there was a(n English) summary available for players. Mechanically though the game is very simple, but for me the money management and 'bidding' for adverts and 'ducks' makes the game what it is. An excellent design that holds up almost 25 years later.

I believe you know the newspaper theme, and each player has individual player boards to represent our respective papers competing to make both the largest newspaper and the most comprehensive story for those events that break that day.

It is a multi-layered area control game, similar to the double layers in Dominant Species in rough concept but without the randomness of the cards. The layers are more abstracted in that they don't contribute in-game to the mechanics (like determining dominance to control card choice) and there isn't turn-order jockeying, so there isn't the churn of DS. Each layer of stories, or area control, will score at the end.

One action each, around the table, with a simple choice of chit pull stacks to speed up the game or extend it. The positioning to end the game and how is a wonderful tension and gives the game a fine finish.

The chits fill a 3x6 common grid player board from which we must select a story, or discard two, and place the story in our paper by combining it with one of our column inches pieces. In the photo above, the color chit is the story and the gridded substrata is our limited and differently sized blocks of text.

This picture is the common board we fill with chit pulls:

We mess with each other by selecting, instead of each story, that little clock chit you see in the 2nd row of the grid in the photo. Doing this, we:
1) advance the endgame, which is the close of editing at midnight for the print run and is represented by advancing that big colorful clock you see.
2) advance through a system of increasing the value of the stories we place ... Late breaking edits are more valuable, but risky as someone can rush the endgame, so there is this sort of push your luck subject to your control rather than randomness... See that big clock in the photo? The red time block means stories placed then are worth 3x the value of those in the first colored block.
3) you get to mess with the other players newspaper by either placing an add (a blocking out of useless space on their layout) or by canceling one of their stories.

When attacking a players paper, we have a bid using a very simple closed economy in which we each hold four numbered checks. Winner gets the effect, loser gets to keep the high check that beat them and increase their position for the next battle of editors. Ah the strike of the pen.

I really liked it. Good multilayered thinking without churn, thematically rich handles to trundle the interlocked mechanics. It was opaque at first, with successive bells coming on as the game ended. I wish we could have played it again.

Bonus: crude interpretations of the German story headlines during gameplay.

It has just the right amount of player interaction without turning into the continuous assault of Dominant Species. Needs a group willing to get through a learning game without necessarily doing well, but all the final lights come on with that first score, so this doesn't have the learning curve of, say, OeL and it's many paths. It's got a simple player-driven economy and predictive look-ahead at the table of chits (I should have said on a turn you can only pull them from the bottom line, so you can see what you leave the others and value choices accordingly).

The story placement isn't an uber-tight puzzle thing, there's room to expand but ways other players can block that expansion.

The game builds a satisfying arc: early jockeying and so forth, and gathering for a big finish. The manipulations are exquisite without being totally opaque. I could see how Ben won, I could see my mistakes, I could see how DJ lost out due to noob group tempo choices speeding the ending of the game before his turn so he could make his own big rush. I could see how Aliza and my early expansions played out and we invisibly allied to try to push the endgame before Ben's tableau ignited.

Update: 2014-01-06 Can't say this ever arrived from Valley Games. Hmm...

A Sumo recommendation back in the day. Have pre-ordered Valley Game's revised translated version.

I love this game. Filling your newspaper with the best (biggest) stories while hoping the competition doesn't make a bigger story of the same type. Worth playing if you ever get a chance.

Brilliant game with the unusual theme of newspaper editing. It has an unusual blend of mechanisms: some spatial elements, some "take that" play, plenty of laughs as you block opponents' stories with annoying adverts. We also had fun coming up with our own translations for the German stories we were placing in our newspapers. Very deserving of a reprint.

A uniquely themed and obscure gem that is equally awesome as it is confrontational.  Who knew newspaper editing could be this competitive and cutthroat?  The rules and the gameplay may seen fairly straightforward in the beginning, but there is definitely a subtlety for long term planning that many first timers may not realize until towards the mid-game.  There is also an aspect of majority control as players vie for the largest sections as well as the biggest individual articles.

Extrablatt's two biggest failings would be the randomness in which the headlines are refilled on the FAX board, in addition to how the endgame degrades to improving your position by sabotaging others through either continually discarding the tiles they need (especially for the person on your left) and/or directly challenging them using the timer.  It's not a terrible design per se, but it does make the game seem somewhat unpolished and incomplete.

Even so, quite a surprising hit for an older title.  I look forward to a reprint (and hopefully a refinement of the rules) if Valley Games ever gets around to it.

After one game I really like this game. More thoughts after couple of games more.

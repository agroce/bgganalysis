RANK: 2267

RATING: 6
I like Heavy Euro Games, I like Thematic Games with meaningful decisions and I also like challenging Abstract Games, so Hegemonic should have been the perfect game for me. Unfortunately I couldn't convince my friends to play it a second time. (It happened the same with 3 different groups.)
The problems they pointed are:
- the embassy seems too strong, so it looks like a single strategy game
- the luck of the tile draw is too big for a game this long
- the game is to long and to complex for an abstract game

Although we all agreed that it might be a good game here, I couldn't convince them to play it again. It didn't seem that a second play will solve those problems. It looked more like after minimum 10 games, MAYBE, we'll find a good game. Nobody wanted to invest so much time in this game. Maybe it wasn't interesting enough, it wasn't challenging enough, it wasn't thematic enough for them.

So I thought: Ok, I'll learn the game playing just with my wife, and after I see the deep strategies it might offer, I'll teach it to my friends again so we can skip the 10 learning games. But then another problem occurred: The game is simply broken as a 2 player game. We tried a few house rules to balance it, but it's just unplayable as a 2 player game. 

Everybody got their expectations high in the wrong direction with this game. The higher the expectation the bigger the disappointment... As others already said, if Hegemonic was marketed from the beginning as an abstract strategy game rather than as a 4x game, it could have done better. And I also think that on the box should be written 3-5 players, not 2-6. (2 is broken and 6 would take forever) 

So maybe Hegemonic is a good game. It seems to be one, but although I had it on the shelf for a looong time, I'll never know.

RATING: 8
Rating is based on 2 player game only at this point.

I've only had the opportunity to play it with 2 and I enjoy it's almost chess-like nature of move/counter move.

With 2, it feels like going relatively heavy in one direction (outposts say) doesn't always work out as your opponent can do the same (with embassies for example) and things balance out.

Alternatively one player can diversify and outlast the other player so it feels like there are a couple of ways to go.

However, that "couple of ways to go" seems like just that: only a couple. I feel like our games were very similar in how they played out. Some folks might find that limiting the replayability. Of course this feeling could simply display the limits of my strategic and tactical thinking!

If people go into the game thinking of it as a 4X like Eclipse or TI3 they may be disappointed as it is more of an abstract area control game with sci-fi and 4X thematic elements. 

Thankfully I like those. 

Components are excellent.

Need to try it with more players.

Update: Finally got a chance to play with 4 and it felt much more diverse and was much more interesting. The importance of timing the area control was clearer.

The downside for me was lots of rules look-ups as there are exceptions and many things to remember. Also not easy to explain as it is quite abstract.

This game needs lots of plays in a short period of time to get the rules a little more ingrained and become smooth playing, but when it does I think it will be a great game.

Hegemonic is definately a good game with a lot of tactic descisions to make. The game is a bit complicated to learn though. Hegemonic probably has a lot of replay value if you are up for it, but I think it's a little bit too long and complex to be able to play the right amount of times to grasp the mechanics fully. I prefer games that are quite easy to learn, but hard to master.

I think this is the best space 4X game. It's got some fantastic components and uniquely interesting gameplay for its genre, but it's too abstract for the demographic that usually goes for this type of game. There are no dice or random events and no cool spaceships to level up. It's basically space chess. Because of that, its rank suffers undeservingly.

The contradiction here is only seeming: Hegemonic is essentially an abstract strategy game, and yet the theme does not feel "pasted on" in the least. I have a thing for games with vast decision spaces (hence my giving Go a rating of 10), and Hegemonic does not disappoint in that area.

Score based on a single play. abstract game with sci-fi overtones. I tried to play it like you would Eclipse, and struggled because of that, as the game rewards quick decisive action over a slow build up of your forces. If any one player gains an advantage is one of the three attack types, they can quite quickly clean house.

Hegemonic is an (almost) pure euro 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game: there is very little luck, and the main mechanics involved are area majority (it has some in common with granddaddies El Grande and Tigris & Euphrates) and simultaneous action selection (Ã  la Race for the Galaxy).

It's the first design by Oliver Kiley (a BGG regular, writer of a very good blog on this site) and it's a very impressive debut: gameplay is tight but smooth, there are three different kinds of pieces one can build with its empire and fight with (and there's the possibility of "cross-kind" fight...), and everything is at the same time very abstract but quite thematic also.

Production value is very high: props to Minion Games for a successful Kickstarter.

My only nit picks are the rulebook (well written overall, but leaves some small grey areas) and playtime (the game is very long and quite analysis paralysis-prone, but I suspect both aspects will get better with few plays): initial tentative rating is 7.5, but could go up if it ends playing  somewhere around 45/min per player.

I was first drawn to this game due to the components and that it is touted as a 4X game. After getting the game, I sought out reviews of the game and was concerned after hearing Tom's review that it was not as good as he thought.

Furthermore it took me a long time to table this as it looks complex and the rules seemed daunting even going through it multiple times and watching various walkthroughs. 

However, when we finally table this today, I must say that I am impressed. The game is as good as it looks. We played without the leaders and it was amazing. I like figuring out where to place the tiles and the order of the actions which actually matter where and when you placed it. Definitely a keeper for me.

Tries to do far to much with conflict, it's like a maths professor PhD student designed it. Our play was with five and only the game owner seemed to understand most of how the combat worked, there were just too many variations with all the numbers everywhere for most of us to understand let alone enjoy. It was a mercy when we stopped after three rounds after time ran out.

For new game 100 of the year, we played a 4 player game of this Monday night. Purple won 93-86-84-79. Expectations were for a big, grandiose space game, Hegemonic is not that. This is essentially an abstract strategy game with a space theme. Also, it is very nasty. Every round (our game went 6 rounds) there will be fighting over control of your complexes, embassies and outposts. Each type of structure gives a certain power level, each of which is calculated differently. Each player has the same set of Action cards from which they will pick one each Action phase (there are 3 action phases per round). They can do 2 actions on the card that they play. The actions involve adding more structures to the board, removing other players structures or taking over the other players structures. 

All of this is quite abstracted. You add up the power of your attack and the power of whom you are attacking, pay some money equal to or double that power and then each player plays one of their tech cards. The tech cards have 3 different values on them, 1 for each kind of attack or defense that can occur. Add up totals and follow up. At the end of the round there is area-control scoring for each sector of space (the 4 player game has 7 sectors). Do this until all hexes have been put onto the board. 

I like Hegemonic for what it offers, which is really different from anything I have played before. There seems to be a steep learning curve to the game so that might make it tough to get to the table again. You have to carefully weigh how important adding buildings is as opposed to attacking the other players. The tech cards felt extraneous as the Techs themselves were pretty ho-hum. I will probably ignore the tech powers next game and just use them to resolve combats. A couple of the other players did not like the game at all as they felt it was too abstracted. Definitely a play before you buy kind of game.

What concerns me with this game is the inclusion of the technology cards which seem to add no strategic significance to a game that seems to have been created with strategy-sans-randomness in mind. They are a prop and not a necessity for the game. The game should be played without them.

2013, 2-6p, 180 min.  AVOID due to length (45 min/p) and abstract-ness?  Also because it involves area control and much conflict.  Not a bad game but just not for everyone (or maybe not good for most people).

Based on TVasel video... Abstract 4X game in space.  Almost no theme.  Essentially a multi-player abstract strategy game of maneuvering pieces into position and attacking (somewhat blindly with cards).  Therefore, it's going to be disliked by many people.  You're not building tons of units for combat but instead you're building bases that attack one another.  Multipurpose cards (technologies on top and attack values x3 at the bottom).  Like many 4X games, the bottom line is that you don't want to lose combat in order to save the card for the technology so you should/will play your best attack/defense card when engaged in combat.  Leaders are almost a "must use" option since they give each player variable player powers that you "charge" and if you charge for multiple turns you can do cooler stuff.  It's easy to teach and understand.  Nice components (rubbery plastic).  Lots of action cards are same-y so it could use more or more variety.  Twilight Imperium = ameritrash, Eclipse = euro, Hegemonic = abstract 4X in space (if you like that sort of thing).

RATING: 7
After 1 play (6-player): 4X is not my genre but it seemed to have removed all the things I didn't like and leave in all the things I do. 

Randomness is minimal.  There are no dice.  There's a deck of cards that does double duty as technologies and modifiers in fights.  Once you've gotten a card, you're never forced to discard it.  Once played as a modifier it's inactive until you either take an action, run out of cards in your hand or the round ends, but then you get it back.  That's the one potential issue.  If a player starts with a strong hand of cards, it gives them an advantage.  However, since there are ways to discard and redraw (part or all of) your hand, it shouldn't be insurmountable.  

Exploration involves placing a new hex but the hexes come out (using a designer approved variant) in Small World fashion where the oldest tile is free and the newest costs $3.  Big enough to slow people down but not stop them if they really want it.  The hexes are well balanced depending on an individual players strategy.

Players can go after political power, industrial power, or military power or a mix of all three.  While attacks work slightly different between them,, the basic concept is the same.  You can almost think of them as calvary, land, and fixed pieces.  You calculate their power differently, but in the end you're comparing your political power in this attack to my political (or industrial or military) power.  

It definitely has more of a Euro-y feel than an Ameritrash feel.  In fact, I'd probably say it felt more like Dominant Species than Eclipse.  Scoring happens at the end of each round and scoring is for 1st,2nd, and presence in each section of the board (with 6 players there were 9 or 10 sections).  So, it's very much not like the Eclipse "mass your forces than expand" strategy.  It's more of a "spread out fast and hope you can keep some presence while not being too far in the lead so everyone gangs up on you".  Like I said, like Dominant Species.  The mechanics are completely different, but the feel is similar.

Playtime took us about 3.5 hours (excluding rules explanation) and I think from here on out, rules explanation will be in the 15 - 20 minute range.  Basic concept: each round is 6 phases: get money, get a new card and place a new tile, Action Phase 1 (2 actions per player), Action Phase 2, Action Phase 3, cleanup.  Each Action Phase is done by role selection (a la RftG) where you can play the same card in each phase if you want.  Then, on your turn you pick 2 actions (could be the same) from the card you played.  Actions are: move, build stuff, attack, get more money, change out your hand of cards, and place another tile.  

It plays well and I think it will scale well.  There's a negotiation element which we didn't use much of where you can lend political power if a player attacks or defends with political power and you can give people money anytime you want.  Although we never thought about it, if we had known who was in the lead, we could have given people money so they had enough to attack the leader with.  Preliminary Rating: 8 with possibility of dropping to a 7 or rising to a 9 or 10.

This is not my style of game: semi-abstract strategy, very confrontational, and with a space theme. However, I think it's an interesting game, with a lot of innovative mechanics. Being able to attack with industry and political power is really cool, and adds a lot thematically to what might otherwise feel like a dry, abstract game. On the other hand, the rules for range and combat for each of the factions are very hard to remember and keep track of, and I still don't fully understand how supporting colonies contribute to the strength of a battle. 

We also had a problem arise in the first game where a player (=me) was lucky to get all the hexes of political power in one color, along with the Tier 3 tech that enabled unlimited re-use of that color during political conflicts. This meant I was basically unstoppable: no one could attack my political bases, which had a combined base strength of 13, and no one could withstand my political attacks. We called the game for me a couple of turns early because it had become a bloodbath. I don't know how common this is (and I imagine with more experienced players this would be less likely to happen) but it did not make for a good first experience.

:tobacco: Some scattered notes:

:d6-1: I hope that my good feeling about this game is not entirely a knock-on effect of actually squeaking out a one-VP win in my first attempt -- the game was less a four-handed battle of wits than an organized series of blunders that someone had to come out on top in.

:d6-2: 4X, as a genre, is really (dip the torches and sharpen the pitchforks, folks) better suited to computer gaming than boardgaming. A computer is far more capable of keeping track of the vast quantity of information needed to make the experience feel right. So I think that Hegemonic works a bit better than Eclipse and Twilight Imperium, paradoxically, precisely because it has so little in common with, say, Masters Of Orion 1 and 2. Everything is very abstracted. There's little in the way of tech-tree action, no ship design, none of the overarching narrative/grand strategic feel of a grand space opera. There's a great deal of conflict, more so than in Eclipse, I'd wager, but it never feels like the clash of mighty fleets in deep space with the pew-pew lasers and the whatnot.

:d6-3: And to me that's mostly fine. I don't give a tinker's cuss for science fiction, as a rule. What I do have more of an issue with, and what holds me back from rushing headlong into spotty teenage infatuation leading to making out with Hegemonic behind the bleachers is a sense of what it is, exactly, I'm [i]doing[/i] here. And that does require a little of the [i]feel[/i] of the thing being simulated to really make a game like Hegemonic seem like more than an exquisitely designed area-control puzzlebox.

:d6-4: To you, that may not matter. There's nae wrong with a intricate puzzlebox, and people who like the way Dominant Species pushes the chaos needle deep into the red will find a lot of tasty meat on Hegemonic's bones, especially once the warp gates start leaping all over the map. To me, that sort of thing sometimes -- often perhaps -- ends up being brain burny but not in a fun way, especially when paired with a theme I don't care much about. The real acid test for the Hypothetical You that is reading this review is: does the undeniably increased complexity result in an increased [i]fun over time[/i] ratio than a more straightforward game like Tammany Hall or Struggle of Empires? If so, this may be the ideal game for you. If not, well, you're less likely to be bailed out by immersive theme than you would if you played Eclipse, much less Twilight Imperium.

:d6-5: Obviously, this is a first-game from-the-hip reaction. I'd be down for a second effort just to see. If nothing else, there's plenty of room for deal-making and negotiation that I think could liven things up immensely. There is, at least, more strategic space to explore than we were able to uncover on a first playing.

:d6-6: tl;dr: Pretty good area control with a light 4X theme and some innovative mechanics. Better than Eclipse but not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. I am a bit ambivalent for mostly idiosyncratic personal reasons, but would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Certainly interesting.  I've played the game a couple of times now and I'm not sure what I think of it.  It's basically an area majority game with slightly asymmetric metrics of influence.  There's nothing all that difficult about the game from a rules standpoint, but certain things (like the cards) do seem fiddly.  I'm not sure what the hand management game is here or if it's to be found at all.  

The negotiation element seems tacked on and I think it might be a better game played without allowing table talk.  There's already plenty of subtle interaction here and I don't see any reason to bludgeon that little dance.  

The themeing is well done too and makes a good deal of sense.  The game is well suited to its genre and there are lots of moments where it really shines (the operation of spies for instance).  

All it all, it certainly deserves more play.  I could see this game really taking off for groups who are willing to give it a few plays.  

A comparison to other 4x seems a little silly.  This is a clean area majority game set in space.  It's certainly a deeper game than TI and is at a similar space to Eclipse.  But, as I said, the comparison is a little silly.

After one play it's a ok game.  Maybe the rating will go up over time.  You need 4 players for this game to be great.  In a 4 player game this game is a 8.5.  In a 2 player game this game is a 6.5.  It's not good two player game.

I definitely like this better than Eclipse. The techs are much more subdued and less critical, and there's a lot less chaos overall. It's also much more abstract and deterministic than Eclipse.

If anything, it might be a little [i]too[/i] deterministic, and I wonder if mandatory recycling of the tech/battle cards would be better. The rulebook is also not the greatest.

Still, thumbs up for now.

Meh.  Like Eclipse, Hegemonic attempts to distill the 4X genre into a "playable evening" and insofar as that goes, it somewhat succeeds.  The problem is that also like Eclipse, Hegemonic simply doesn't feel like a 4X.  Honestly, if you don't like 4X, then just steer clear of the genre instead of trying to boil it down to something else.  To Eclipse's credit, I find it much more playable than this one.

Hegemonic has some great ideas and beautiful components, but the meat-n-potatoes of the game is mired in unrewarding mechanics and math (albeit basic math), hampered by some poor graphic design choices.  I found myself spending most of my time counting numbers, the result of an attempt to eliminate dice from the game.  Does it work?  Sure.  It works just fine and doesn't lead to any ambiguity, but it sure isn't that much fun.  On top of that, the "attack" and "defense" numbers for each space are on opposite sides, have only a geometric distinction (seriously, would it have been hard to make it red and blue?) and so tiny as to be blocked by the pieces if you're not towering over the table.

All that said, Hegemonic is not a bad game by any means.  It has interesting ideas and is certainly unique in the landscape, but I find it's a bit on the fiddly side and I personally would rather play Eclipse; but as you might guess from my rating of that one, I'm not too fond of either game.  That's just me.  YMMV

After one play: miniatures and player boards are very nice, in both design to aid play and in appearance.  Graphics on galaxy sectors (hex tiles) are pretty and iconography helpful to game play.  This has a thematic feel like Eclipse, but is not really a resource allocation/production game.   It's more of a battle game, with three kinds of power (industrial, military, and political).  The unique (to me) aspect of this game is that the laying of "sector" hex tiles controls your ability to expand your power and limits your opponent's ability to do so.  The battle rules seem a bit baroque on upon first play odd to play with.  The use of prioritized action cards (e.g. assault, build, lay new tiles) adds an element of second guessing what your opponent wants to do, somewhat reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy, but a lot more tightly interlocked between players.

Rating after one play, more likely to go up than down with subsequent plays. First play was soured by my playing the Industrialization rules completely wrong, and discovering my error too late to do anything but basically concede. 

Never have cared for games with cards that I can't see worth a damn across the table that affect play dramatically. And never have cared for multiplayer games that give losing players the ability to trigger the end of the game. And despite relatively low randomness, nevertheless found myself drawing from the tech card pile on the final turn hoping for the Level 2 or 3 card that would have won the game (I drew a Level 1, so lost). 

Liked the mechanics, though, and look forward to trying it again.

More of a 3x then a 4x as not much exploring is going on which is my favorite part of 4x games but still not bad. Explanation of combat makes it sound harder then it is, great bits and player mat design with 2 layers so your pieces don't fall out like they do in Eclipse but in the inevitable comparison between the two Eclipse is the better game.

RATING: 4.5
3 plays.

Decidedly Euro 4x space game comparable in my view to Tigris & Euphrates.  The exploration is placing tiles once a turn (possibly more if players choose it).  Does choosing 1 of 4 tiles feel like exploration?  The same with the combats, which are choosing one of 3 attack values to use, plus a card value, and taking the measured outcome.  The winning condition is similarly Euro, a fixed number or rounds using an area scoring mechanic for each round.  The twist with the game is that the different attacks each have different ranges/ support modifiers, as well as possible technologies, which in my 3 plays with different groups were confusing to everyone who played it.  The good news here is the designer put up a very helpful video by which to learn the game, and I thought that was excellent.  For me, the abstract nature of the game combined with the unintuitive rules made for a labored overall experience.

Hegemonic, its been sitting around for while but after playing TI3 & Eclipse recently I decided to finally to break this 4x game out. Turned out to be rather different from those two games, this one is much more abstract with no spaceships flying around and more importantly no dice rolls and more deterministic combat. The game was certainly epic and as Angus puts it succinctly it fails to have memorable epic moments. Probably because everyone pretty much has the same equipment and the same combat methods from turn to turn. 

It was a long game but still plays in slightly less than half the time of TI3 and probably about the same length as Eclipse. 

What I liked was the simultaneous order cards, the streamline combat and decision making and the relatively non-AP prone nature of the game. I liked the fact that combat was fast and sweet, which is my least favorite aspect of Eclipse. But there is something to be said about die rolls, that builds tension. The combat die rolls in eclipse was just took too long, combat could become boring for spectators sometimes, TI3 does it really well, with no defensive die rolls, that speeds it up quite a bit but Hegemonic with just card play just didn't feel as exciting and in the final rounds was just pointless as combat results were always predictable.

The other things worth mentioning is the dual use tech/combat cards, it was not a bad way of managing the tech tree, it was easier for newbies to digest compared to TI3 and Eclipse. On the other hand the tech didn't seem to make a huge difference in player abilities, don't get me wrong the techs were very useful but just having 3 at a time and the fact that there were only 3 tiers meant that there wasn't much differentiation between players. 

The race powers weren't that stand-out either compare to both TI3 and Eclipse. Both those games does it much better. 

Overall, it was a good game on its own and I think has a place in the ever more competitive 4x space games, its easier to teach and understand and I would be interested to see if it plays as well with less players. Those other games are always preferable with 4+ players but this one may not matter as much. I would play it again. Our next Space 4x game will be another game of TI3 on the 28th and probably Empires of the Void soon, which looks awesome as well.

RATING: 7.9
Great tactical space game. The game is about getting dominance in certain area's to score VP's. There are three ways to gain dominance in an area: Industrial Power, Political power and Martial Power. 1st place gains 6 VP's, 2nd place 3 VP's etcetera. With tactical placement, research development and money management you will try to gain the adventage above your opponents.

I had my focus on martial power and industrial power in my first play, and let political power slide because those are expensive. Huge mistake. You really should invest in all types of power. It gives really more options.

It is certainly a game I like and I'm looking forward to play again with the optional leadership cards(gives each house awesome abilities)

The game seems to be about positioning of pieces so as you can project your power to where you need to be to pick up points. The very strict focus on area scoring really shapes the game, cohabitation of spaces is really encouraged in a way that I haven't seen before in other games. There are points to be had for getting into more areas, but positioning pieces such that you can actually put your power to use in the right areas creates interesting problems. And all three types of power combine and reach out in different ways that shape strategies. After a little initial sprawling the game becomes pretty conflict heavy, with lots of little elements playing (order of cards, where the arbiter is sitting, who can afford more than one attack etc). Your power structure is often very fragile, and one poorly timed attack can knock you out for a long time. Not necessarily bad, but volatile and sharp edged. It does feel like space! The artwork is excellent, all the layout is very clear, and I found the rules relatively easy going, and even found the game fairly simple to teach. Excellent components.

One game under the belt.

First, The level of interaction between the different systems in play is much more sophisticated than what I was expecting. Also, I will need many more plays before I can make my mind.

--

After a few more plays, this game feels very abstract. It doesn't feel like a 4X in the way Eclipse of Twilight Imperium feels like a 4X.

The feel of the game is much closer to Tigris & Euphrates or go in space than anything else. Luck plays almost no role. I would say this is a thinking man's 4X game.

Second play with 4, still a very solid game and much more balanced than 3-player (which I fear is very close to being broken using the suggested setup).  The thing I appreciated most the second time around was how thematically integrated the mechanisms of the different game systems are.  Industry provides an easy boost to your money supply but is very much a system of physical objects in space; using it effectively requires a strong cluster of units in close proximity (or using gates to achieve virtual proximity) to achieve maximum effect (see also: China's manufacturing supremacy).  Military has a little more freedom of movement and is perhaps the easiest to build up rapidly, but again is constrained by "lines of supply" and can easily become stretched thin if expanded too far from the home base without strong outposts to support it.  Talk, on the other hand, requires no such supply lines, and political power can expand across the galaxy with impunity and wielded at will, though doing so requires relatively large amounts of political capital (the abstraction of all resources into one currency helps greatly in this regard). The game is still very, very abstract (again, not a big minus in my book) but I would say that based on my experience the thematic elements do start to reveal themselves upon repeated play, which is why I hope to get this to the table more often.

Original Review: 

Based on one play with 3 this is a really solid game, though as others have commented it has very little relation to the 4x genre (other than certain superficial thematic trappings) and would probably be disappointing to players expecting a 4x game.  For me, though, that's exactly what drew me to the game and I was not disappointed.  A bit of a bear to teach, but once everyone is up to speed the game has a great flow to it with very little downtime for a game of this complexity (barring any AP).  As one participant commented, "this isn't nearly as complicated as the rules explanation made it sound."  Despite the grand space-opera theme, the game itself is quite constrained, with both tight money supply and a limited number of actions requiring laser-like focus to accomplish your objectives.  I also really appreciated the tension between having to build up a useful force engine and actually using it to score points.  The different building systems seemed well balanced to me and the interplay between them was very interesting.

Hegemonic is a well-designed game that scratches the 4x itch in some very original ways. It offers a solid blend of mechanics and the production is high-quality. Gameplay is deep and interactive with an interesting blend of tactical decision making and strategic planning. The abstract framework of the game makes it somewhat tedious to teach and prone to AP.  This is admittedly for a limited audience, but will be a hit for those who enjoy this style of game.

There's so much strategic depth, definately gives the 4x feeling and it looks really fantastic!

Furthermore, it is very fast paced and thus able to be played comfortably on a single evening during working weeks.

I think the game tries to do too much and is too fiddly... there are various modes to attack another player and they didn't always make sense to me (attack another player with politics or military)... the bits are pretty but i found it difficult to get all the options and the relationships between the various locations. This game reminded me of Colonia, a game released about 5 years ago that tried to mix and match mechanics of various games but didn't come together as its own thing...

Well now. As of right now I'd have to give it a 7.75 rating. Over all the game is fantastic but still requires a little polishing. I enjoyed it, my fiancÃ© who showed up after the rules were explained picked up on it within one turn of watching us play. It defineately corrects some of the deficincies from Eclipse and I'd play again. Looks like I'll be giving minion games some of my hard earned cash once this comes out. 

Based on how long it took us to play (4 hours for a rules explanation + a 6 player game with mostly people who'd never played it before and 1 person who'd never played a 4x game) I could definitely see this game introducing more players to the 4x category of gaming

Played at Origins 2013, seems to distill things down so that within the 2nd round you're juking for position on the board with people.  Game is a lot quicker, but deep, every type of base/unit (Industrial, Political, Martial) has a way to attack the other.

Did find this randomly at Half-Price, though, so picked it up to try or trade away. Seemed brand new but punched, cards are still wrapped, and with neat metal CAPs in 5000 denomination, may be from Kickstarter. Read the book with Abigail, but seemed to be more complicated than needed for our group.

RATING: N/A
[i]I'm the designer!  Here's my brief take on the design:[/i]

[b]Hegemonic[/b] contains many of the familiar 4X activities (exploration, expansion, technology, empire building, conflict), but focuses the gameplay around an area majority scoring mechanic (think [i]El Grande[/i]).  There are multiple ways to control territory, by building up your industrial, political, or martial systems.  Each of these systems can attack the others, leading to highly intertwined empires with a lot of space for creative moves to take place and different strategies to emerge.

The level of conflict and their dynamics are similar to [i]Dominant Species[/i] and [i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i].  Players will build up concentrations of power that they project out in various ways to impact their opponents. Downtime is reduced to a minimum through simultaneous turns and action selection.  Luck and randomness is largely absent, with players being in the driver seat of their strategy.

If you enjoy euro-games with a high degree of conflict and interaction, opportunities for negotiation, low luck, and lots of strategy, all wrapped into a 4X-style space empire game, Hegemonic is for you.

Heavy euro game. Do not compare this to Eclipse or TI! This is totally different game. Awesome euro, with a lot of strategies and ways to score points. Main focus - area control/majority. A lot of talking (aliances) during gameplay makes AP not an issue. Mostly strategic game with some tactical (hard) choices to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Incomplete play. Definitely interested. I think I like it more than eclipse because it's less random and the combat is more strategic than tactical. That is, you can go about domination in multiple ways, and your opponents had better balance their defenses or they will be easily overtaken. Those who say Eclipse is a an economic euro game in disguise may be partially right, but I rather dislike the part where I customize my ship and roll dice after dice to find out I took a bad risk. Hegemonic seems more euro to me because of its balance and the variation in mechanics with the three different paths. I'd like to play again before a final rating.

After a second (and complete) play, I'm still unsure of how much I like this game. A strong political strategy is very difficult to break, though military can build up in a similar, albeit less flexible, way. The industrial side of things seems weaker, though I suppose it's really there for economic support. This means every player needs to push for strength through political or military paths. Then again, maybe a 4p game just needs to be more aggressive early on to prevent any footholds. Still worth another try.

Initially, this seemed better than Eclipse.  On repeated plays, it became apparent that the Embassy strategy is by far the most powerful.  

The way to combat this is through diplomacy and alliances, but that turns every game into the Embassy player vs. the non-embassy players.  A fantastic and deep game becomes a little one dimensional.

I like this game. Though it is complicated, the underlying principles are simple and once you get through the initial push this game becomes incredibly fun and intricate. 

It's very political and can turn all of your friends against each other as each one strikes up secret agreements or openly pays another to do his bidding.

The pieces and board are very high quality and although the colors of the pieces may seem too bright (neon orange, etc.), they end up working very well and the game is definitely pretty to look at.

Great game. I find it thematic, and nice: I like to imagine different cultures expanding in the galaxy in a very long time. 

I think the game is not having the success it deserves because it needs more plays to be appreciated (becoming  proficient with the rules and the strategies). I am afraid people give up playing too soon, and it is a pity, because this is a wonderful game. Consequently its BGG rating and ranking are not adequate IMHO. 

It has great replayability and incredibly high interaction: sometimes there are big diplomatic discussions that are quite interesting. And it offers a lot of strategic choices, a huge decision space, as I like in games.

I like it much more than Eclipse, for a lot of reasons. For example because the way to win is determined by who has more area control on the galaxy and not by how many points  one collects in a mixed salad way.

Recommended.

Space struggle writ large.  You are the confluence of three superimposed dynamics of interaction across the entire galaxy.  Each dynamic has its own units, its own rules and modes of behavior.  The pieces on the board don't represent individual ships, they represent societies.  Balancing these different modes of interaction makes for a mind boggling and endlessly satisfying experience.  Several games in I feel I have just scratched the surface on this one.  I want a good desert island and five friends where we can give this the attention it deserves.

I'd been wanting to play this for a while - I had wanted to back the original kickstarter, but didn't because I couldn't justify the cost at the time, especially as I didn't think it was likely to see much play in my groups. But at the start of 2014 I discovered that a member of our local gaming group had in fact backed it, his copy having just arrived. We tried to play it then, but with none of us having read the rules in advance, we gave up and played something else, planning to try again at a later time. That finally happened later that year. It was a 4-player game.

We got a fair few rules wrong early on (notably moving multiple fleets/agents in a single move action, as well as not realising you could attack with a base rather than a unit), but by the end I think we had a fair idea of how to play - mechanically, anyway. I would definitely like to play it again to explore the game system some more, but I was overall quite disappointed by the experience. Firstly, the components weren't particularly well-produced for what I understand was a pretty expensive game (although the player boards are nicely done) - I never really got the feeling that I was in control of a space empire. In terms of gameplay I never got a handle onto what I should be trying to do - of course the VPs are all based on area control, so you build things and try to attack other players, but the fact that it's hard to predict turn order (your pieces might have been wiped off the board by the time you take the action you've planned) made the game feel very chaotic, despite the fact that there is actually relatively little luck. (The simultaneous action selection of course adds to this.) The bonuses given by the technology cards seemed not very interesting, and as far as playing cards in combat is concerned, there is rarely a reason not to play the highest value you have (the obvious exception is when you think it won't make a difference anyway and you want to save your high-value card for another combat of that type later this turn).

I was the one who finished last by a long way - cash was very tight all the way through, as once you start losing your bases you lose income and it is almost impossible to recover. This is probably where the plentiful "political" elements of the game come in - the arbiter getting to pick turn order, and even more so players with embassies choosing to support a player in combat or not - to allow a trailing player to catch up. We didn't really see much of this, but I can see it being important among experienced players.

By the end of the game, I could see that embassies could be very powerful due to their ability to influence combat from anywhere on the board, and that outposts could also be so because of the way their combat bonuses stack - but I struggle to see the value of complexes, especially as they give less income than the other bases. I'm sure they must serve a purpose though - and this is a game I'm quite intrigued by and would like to play again at some point. But nonetheless I came away disappointed, and am not in a huge rush to play again soon. (A second game has never happened, and most likely never will - despite the fact that, as I said, I think it's a game that certainly deserves at least 1 more chance.)

The differences between the three kinds of power base was interesting in theory -- the way you project power is interesting.  However, the game surrounding those mechanics left my frustrated, bored, and eager for the game to end.  Random card draws were frustrating, but possibly not as influential as they appeared at first.  I was mostly frustrating by the back-and-forth politics/kingmaking/kill-doctor-lucky style politics -- it felt neither like a good strategy game nor a good politics game.  The end game ended up dragging, and overall the game felt too long for what it was.

A pre owned version, with custom made organiser insert and cards sleeved.

Condition: Very Good
Notes: This is the Kickstarter version with foil designer signature on the box lid. Please note that I won't be including any velvet bags or metal coins with this game; the bags and metal coins I had have been put into service with other games. (The original cardboard money is, of course, included.)

After first play I can say that this game is totally diferent from every game I own. I like, theme, I like components, I little dislike conflict mechanism, but all in all after we play few more times it could be interesting to play.

This game is more abstract then Eclipse is. It offers me a lot of joy and similar feeling like in Dominant Spieces. These two are very comparable strategy games. Highly recommended.

It might not be a popular opinion, but in my eyes it's the best 4X, much, much better than Eclipse. Very euroy, virtually no randomness, strategical thinking close to that of GoT, and - to me - very thematic, as it deals with a higher level view than flying and fireing individual ships. Does what it was supposed to do almost perfectly and is now my favorite confrontational game for 3-5 people (because 6 people=AGoT, duh).

Only one game in so far, but my first impression is that this is a solid design. It looks good on the table, with the double layered player boards and plastic 3d models being a nice touch. The inevitable comparison with Eclipse may be somewhat unfair, since Eclipse is such an outstanding game. Eclipse is more thematic, but also a bit more chaotic and random (not necessarily a bad thing in small doses). Hegemonic has a nice flow and an interesting decision tree, but ultimately has a more chess-like feel to it (compared to Eclipse that has a more exciting and unpredictable "let's-see what-happens-next" feel to it.)

Abstract area control in space.  The different leader abilities can be helpful and adds to the game nicely.  Very few turns so you can't be conservative.

The mechanics of the 3 kinds of bases being different and yet similar makes for a very complex, yet thrilling game with much interaction.
Everything in this game 'works'. It is abstract and needs a bit of getting used to, but once you see the logic behind it all, the sheer genius of the game design strikes you hard.

The game seems 'perfect', mechanics wise, balance wise, etc.

But there is not much fun in it, plus the constant brain churning makes it hard to enjoy. 

It's a better test of skill than Eclipse, but given the choice, I'd most likely pick Eclipse over this every time.

EDIT: played again, had much more fun. Maybe it takes time to appreciate.

There are a lot of good reviews for the game, so perhaps we just had a bad experience with it. We felt that the game was too overly complex, and this is coming from a group that plays games just like this. We were still consoling the rule book two hours into the game about how some of the mechanics worked, and by then we just started to lose interest. There's a lot of moving pieces here so you just have to be attentive to what's happening, but that said there's a ton of potential for this game and I would try it again if asked.

Decent game. A bit more abstract than I would like. Not a lot of tension in the combat - too deterministic IMO. I would play it again, but I am not seeking to purchase.

I would like to see some new things, such as secret tech - e.g. pay 2 CAP to install a tech face down. You can then activate it any time by paying its cost and flipping it face up.

P.S. the metal coins are AMAZING!

Don't be fooled by the plastic bits, this is a quite abstract eurogame with the theme pasted on and the tiniest dash of ameritrash on top to give it some flavour. It's not bad, but it's not really a sci-fi game either, if thatÂ´s what you are looking for. Also, little bit dry and mathy. Very nice production, though. Materials are of a good quality and it looks really pretty on the table.
Not for me, though.

A "different" kind of 4x game.  More of an Area Control game than 4x game. It really isn't comparable to the TI/Eclipse sort of games in what it tries to accomplish, so room for this one in the collection.

I like everything that the game does except for the relative fiddliness of conflict.  I think we played it right, but I'm not entirely sure we did.  If the rules would have been more clear on this, the game would be an 8.

RATING: N/A
In a post human galactic race to expand our empire to a neighboring galaxy in full euro-game fashion.  This game does not emphasize ships and doesn't use a tech tree for upgrades. Not at all bad just emphasizing this game does not play at all like its immediate predecessors. It emphasizes developing planets for industry, politics, or martial capability. The box aptly describes this as deep strategy with minimal luck-based game play. Conflict, subversion, and intrigue are managed from tactical area control and card play. The attack phase between the three types of planet types gets crazy complex. You will consult rules often. At 3-4 hours, the game is longish for our group.

Heavy, epic and a little intimidating at first. But girlfriend and I played and enjoyed 2 player.  Would like to give this a swing with 6 players and see how it plays.

One play with five players using leaders.  First impression was that five players is too many.  Even with experience, or maybe especially with experience, the down time is noticeable.  I may give it another try with three or four.  Very much an area majority game.

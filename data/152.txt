I seeked out a game as it was supposed to be the best 5 player climbing game (after Tichu for 4), it does feel deliciously intricate but scoring seems quite convulted and would take a few hands or even games to get used to it, so you would need players who can become competent quickly as you rely on them to be part of your temporary alliances.

Plus it wasn't a climbing game, guess Tichu still holds the crown for card games.

Ugh, this fell in my closet, and now I can't find the red 4 card. Not sure if I lost it in there, or if I never had it from when I traded for it. Would love to get a replacement, but Rio Grande didn't have one when I asked on 5-1-13

Really enjoyed my first play of this, could see my 8/10 ratings going up on future plays. If Haggis is for 2/3, Tichu is for 4, Mu is the equivalent game for five (or more?). I like the two trump suits idea, and the fact that you don't know who is going to be on your team/partnership during the bidding. Very clever, I'm sure there's lots of depth there and want to play more!

RATING: 8.5
Mu, if you can find three, four, or five players to play with you, can be a lot of fun.  However it is quite complex, for a modern card game.  And is essentially an update to the card game bridge (from which it borrows many elements heavily from).  However it introduces some cool new elements, mainly to bidding.  Such as bidding for not only one trump, but two, that can be colors or numbers!  Or the ability for the bid leader to pick his partner.  Pretty cool stuff that all jives well.  For some reason though, the game is rare, and trying to find players is hard.  Everyone loves Tichu more, despite Mu being a better game.

i've never played bridge, maybe it would help if i had.  i'm not referring to the complexity, but the game's supposed to be bridge-like.  i like trick-taking games and this one didn't really do it for me.  safaru is a pretty fun 2-player game, though.  also like the card art.  the rest of the games don't really seem to be unique.  traded away, and traded back for it to give it another chance.  still haven't done so.

Mu (8): I am singularly spectacularly bad at this game. I just seem to be absolutely unable to properly evaluate my hand. Ever. And this trend continues, even as this game hits a nickel. UPDATE: This game gets better. I still think if people were more aggressive with the bidding it would be more fun. UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: I was right.

The Last Panther (5): A pretty good game with similarities to Hearts -- you want to take yellow cards, and avoid reds and the two black 7s. Just different enough from Hearts to make my beginner's Hearts strategies awful ones for this game. I recommend alternating passing directions (maybe even a 'no pass' round) to avoid engendering hard feelings. (J--- passed me a black 7 EVERY ROUND. Argh.)

Safaru: (6) A fun catching game, but boy is it hard to count up all your points at the end.

(Two wooden counters of each colour placed in box to use to easily identify major and under trumps.)

Az egyik legbjobb kártyajáték, amivel valaha játszottam, már önmagában a Mü is, de a másik is tetszett, amit próbáltunk.
Mü: a licit egyedülálló (ki mennyi infót fed fel a posztok elérése érdekében, vagy akár azért, hogy őt válassza ki az elnök társnak). A pontozás is nagyon egyedi: egyedileg ill.csapatként eltérően jutalmaz/büntet a játék. Bármikor játszanék vele, és szerintem nagyon sok játéklehetőség benne van! Elég mélynek tűnt elsőre. Kis kártyajáték, mégis 20 perc+ a szabály.
Utolsó párduc: nagyon élveztem, annak ellenére, hogy szerintem túl egyértelmű, hogyan kell játszani. A draftolás miatt már az elején eldőlhet egy leosztás.

Already have Tichu for 4 players of a card game.  I inquired about it playing with 6 and it wasn't recommended.  Anyways I already have Stichlen and I can play any card game with it.

First Game: 9-1-07
It is a pretty cool game.  A game of variable teams and "bidding" mechanic.  I played it with 6 and it seemed to have worked.  I am not convinced though.  It seems like if you are unlucky with a few hands in the beginning that you cannot grab any tricks then you have no way catching up.  One mechanic that you might be able to catch up is by getting chosen to be the Chief's partner but that is a total crap shoot.  I am willing to play more and find out if my first impressions are wrong (I hope so).  Also, seeing the cards now, I cannot play this game with a Stichlen deck.
Initial Rating: 7.

GameSystem, MultiOnly

The rating is for the game I have played with Mu & Mehr (Wimmuln, Safaru, Calcory, etc).  I have never played Mu itself, mostly because it's hard for me to round up five players who like bidding trick card games enough for Mu.  I went and bought a second deck, too.  :)
  
I keep this game around not so much because of the title game, Mu, which I've never played but do want to one day, but because of the novelty of a pack of cards entirely unlike any traditional cards, and because of the extra games that one can play with these cards.  It's more fun to play Casino/Scopa with panthers, unicorns, dragons, hedehogs, and phoenixes, than it is with hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds.

Mu is really great for 5. Rotating and uneven partnerships are fun! The bidding is interesting, in that you have multiple goals: signaling (not too much) info, becoming chief/vice, allowing for trump options, and determining bonuses.

RATING: 8
Okay, finally got to play this years after I got rid of my copy thinking I would never get this to the table.  We played Mu with five and six people.  What an awsome trick taking game.  I think with more play, the rating will go up.  For me, it won't replace some of the great trick taking games that I play but could be in the rotation.  It's different from the other ones I play.  The bidding is unique as you bid cards, which reveals your hand.  This knowledge is also used to pick your partner and call trump, as well.  An 8.5 right now, but I see this going up.

Update:  Brought to a 7.5.  It can go up if I play it more but I can't push this into the upper eschelon of trick taking games yet.

Update Mar '12 - Moved up to an 8.  I feel pretty good now on bidding, evaluating and playing out a hand.

Complicated and fiddly yet not much depth in card play.  Way too much trump overcomes any meaningful play.  The choice of trump almost entirely determines the worth of your hand, crap or godly.

I've not yet played Mu.  It looks like a very complicated Bridge variant, but the idea of making your contract more difficult by being the one who has revealed the most cards is really quite ingenious.  I'm looking forward to giving this (these) a try.

Safaru: This one's basically a  Casino  variant -- and it's bloody hard!  Quite good, though.  Perhaps suffers from having the blue (unicorn) cards worth too much overall.

The Last Panther: This one's basically  Hearts  with more complicated scoring.  That's a good thing, by the way.   Hearts  is probably one of my favourite games for 3 players.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting card game, the low and middle power cards are the scoring cards, and there is a lot of trump, called by the highest bidders, and trump is either suits or numbers.

Bidding with open face cards adds some layer of strategy and it is not clear the best way to bring cards forward.

My biggest complaint is that with the partner dynamic, there is no way to make up ground after a loss.  The chief can win big (with a partner) but the partner does not suffer in a loss, so it seems that the best strategy is simply to find a way to be the winning partner.

Mu is an excellent trick taking game (and possibly the deepest trick taker ever), and one of my favorites. The rules tend sound confusing at first but it's pretty simple once you play a few rounds. It does take a good number of plays to really understand the strategies (especially for bidding), though. The game is at its best when you can get the same group to play it regularly. The only real flaw is that the game is only at its best with exactly five players. With four it's far too easy for the chief to make his bid, and with six it's far too difficult. But other than that little quibble, a superb game.

Clever trick taking game.  This gets to the point.  The 2 on 3 idea is great.  Has a huge learning curve that a complex trick taking game should have, and has alot of things that bridge doesn't, switching partners, individual scoring, etc.  It has also elements of Pinochle, which IMO, is the most fun trick taking game to play.

RATING: 9
The base game (Mu) is a fun trick-taking game that plays very well with 5 players (chief and one partner versus vice-chief and two partners).  The one drawback is that this is *not* a beginner trick-taking game, so I wouldn't introduce it to people who are completely new to trick-taking.  However, the other game rules included might be better trick-taking gateway games...

The "mehr" part consists of a few other mostly trick-taking games that can be played with various numbers of players.  "The Last Panther" is a trick-taking game that works best for 3 players and is reminiscent of Hearts.  "Safaru" is a game that works well for 2 players in which cards in one's hand are used to capture cards on the table based on matching or summing number values.  "Rummu" is a rummyish game that uses hedgehogs (yellow suit) as wilds.

In general, there's are games in here for many different situations (numbers of players and type of game desired).  It's a good game to pick up just for that variety.

Wonderful trick taking game of shifting partnerships. Each hand the players split into two teams based on an auction and the auction winner's team must try to score a target number of points. It is complex but after a couple of hands you know what you are doing. Of the other games that come in the box, I have played a lot of Wimmuln. It is a much shorter but also great tricktaking game. You secretly bid a number of tricks you think you will win using cards from your hand. Rummu is a fairly bland rummy game. The Last Panther was a fun simple trick taker. Safaru is a game that requires vast brain melting amounts of mental arithmetic but seemed to have fairly obvious choices.

4 plays, 3x6p, 1x4p. My rating could easily rise if I could get this to the table more often... I think with more plays I'm going to increase my love this intelligent game with a lot going on. I can see how 6 players isn't ideal for it, nonetheless interesting and fun... Even playing with a bunch of stressed-out drunken school teachers with nonstop chatter, oxygen-gasping laughter, and toddlers running in and out of the room... I mentioned George Clooney to distract an opponent and it worked, even causing her to knock over her wine glass...yes, cards now wine-soaked after one play... Take note of the pros and cons of that tactic. Miss N. started talking about the game the next morning on her own initiative, which is a great sign! I painted wooden components for Chief, Vice, and Chief's teammate, trump selections, bid numbers, and player aids - made it a lot easier to introduce the game. Update: bought 2 more copies (including "Lots More").

Good trick-taking game with somewhat hairy tactics.  Can be difficult to get serious card players or board gamers interested since it's more or less a mutant version of Bridge.  Still, it's worth the time and effort and when it plays smoothly, it's a lot of fun.  Biggest con is that there are just better trick taking games available (Dia de los Muertes/Four Dragons and Victory and Honor, for example).

RATING: 7
Production: Great cards: the paragon of elegance. For The Last Panther, a specialty deck would have some indication of the point values for red, yellow, and black sevens. Other than the two black sevens, the double sevens don't add much to the game. So this is a case of a game being playable with the pre-fab deck, but one where a game-specific deck would have been better.

Play (Mü): Fun, tactical game of easy alliances.  The real interesting choices seem to be in the bidding, as players assess their hands.  The card play is more obvious. (3+1+3) (2 plays)

Play (Safarü): Some hand-management choices, and tough choices when one is faced with a forced collection of either a few yellows, or a baby.  Quick play, elegant scoring. (3+1+2) (1 play)

Play (The Last Panther): Lives up to its word of being anti-trick taking. On average, a player would do better to take zero tricks, since the game's end condition assumes that players are headed in the negative direction. Passing cards is a key component, allowing a player to void suits. There is some opportunity for clever play, but it is perhaps too easy to dump the black sevens on an unsuspecting player. (2+1+3) (1 play)

Great fun - a card bidding game that, well as we played it, is not too serious. Brilliant for the burnt-out bridge player or someone who likes trick taking games but doesn't want to take on a new hobby studying the game and bidding conventions.

Mü: The addition of the variable points for cards and the card-revealing bidding system to a trick-taking game has good results. Like most bidding trick-taking games, takes forever with new players.

The Last Panther: Really, really doesn't scale to 7. Otherwise, not as good as Hearts. However, the cards go out evenly, so I'll just make it more Hearts-like and be happy. Change the passing pattern, don't require the green 5 to be led (it tends to win, and to take some red or worse the black 7), and this would be a better game.

[1 play] This was one of those games I wanted to like, or felt I should like, more than I actually did.  One of the people I played with praised Mu for its simplicity in comparison to bridge--instead of having complex bidding conventions, you just show cards.  But I felt this game could do with a few bidding conventions.  Anyway, I'd be willing to play this again--maybe after a first play to wrap your brain around how it works, on a second play the fun would start to emerge.  Then again, maybe not. The card design is beautiful and ingenious; I love the look of the game.

One of the best trick-taking games. It has unique bidding rules, variable trump suits, and although it is a cutthroat game, it uses temporary partnerships. Supports 4-6 players, but plays best with 5.

Unlike most bidding games, you aren't required to meet or even exceed the leading bid, and the second highest bidder gets a special role. Also, a player who passes may jump back into the bidding.

I love how the bidding works, especially how you can use bids to send signals to the potential "chief." "Check out my bid. Aren't these cards a good sign that you should pick me as your partner?"

[b]Mü[/b] (6): A partnership game with an interesting (but not intuitive) bidding phase where players wrestle for the privilege to define trump and try to send signals about who might want to play with whom.

It takes a couple of hands to get the hang of it. When that happens it's quite a delightful little game.

[b]The Last Panther[/b] (6): This is a quick and easy diversion not entirely unlike Hearts. There's not a lot you can do if you end up with a bad hand, but since a hand only lasts a couple of minutes and a game just a handful of hands that's still very reasonable.

We only get two hands in at lunch, but there's depth here.  I like the constantly shifting possible alliances during the bidding round.  I think I prefer 4 or 5 players over 6.  It is a problem for our lunchtime group that you can get a sucky hand where you pretty much watch from the sidelines... and with only 2 hands in 45 minutes, that's not good.  Replaced by Die Sieben Siegel.

(December 2005) Based on playing just a few games of Mu, I am impressed and find it very challenging. We play it with 5 players, which works well -- two players with the high trump against the other three. It is challenging to make your bid in our games.

There is a learning curve for the first couple games, but it is oh so good once you get through that.  Temporary partnerships make the game exciting.

My rating is for Mü itself, and would probably rise if I could just get a better handle on the bidding.  It seems like there's a lot of depth there, but I'll admit that most of it escapes me currently.  Anyone want to write an article?  My other frustration with Mu is the way the endgame often disintegrates into kingmaking, frustration, and game-y calculation.  A shame, because it really is a very engaging and provocative game.  I suggest using an endgame-trigger variant (such as rolling a die to see if the game ends once someone hits 150 a la I'm The Boss)  I've played most of the other games in the box, and the only one I would be willing to play again is Wimmüln.  My rating for Wimmüln is 6.  It's a modestly interesting spin on "Oh Hell" but ultimately is weaker than basic Oh Hell, and far weaker than the improved Oh Hell variants like Die Sieben Siegel and Wizard.  The five-suited deck combines with the ability to strip two cards from your hand to create too many voids, taking most of the skill away from the cardplay and the estimation.

I know I'll lose the respect of some gamers with this comment, but I really just found this game too damn hard...and I even LIKE trick-taking games.

Also, I agree wtih Joe Lee's comment: "I prefer partnership games where my partner is really my partner." For a five-player trick-taker, give me Die Sieben Siegel any day.

The first time I played this game, I fell in love with it. I tried it again with my new group, and it didn't go over as well. Not bad, but the learning curve was steep. Will update rating upon more plays.

This being only my second trick taking game ever, I got it pretty easily and I really took to it. The art is a bit confusing and it is tough communicating what you have to others when revealing cards, but that is half of the fun for me. Happy it is out in a Rio Grande Games version now, might get more plays.

Based on one solo play (5-hands) of Mu this is a terrific trick-taking game.

There are some interesting mechanics in the bidding that pass knowledge as in contract bridge via exposing cards bid with to the table.

The trumps follow some of the German-style merged suit trumps from other trick taking games, and like them points scored depend on the exact cards captured, not just the straight numeric value.

Lots of cool mechanics, plays well for more than 4, pretty good quality cards- this one's a keeper!

A heavy point trick game that's comfortably as complex as more established designs like Skat. You need several plays just to get your head around the rules, as concepts like the card distribution and bidding that's only loosely connected to card points will catch out standard deck card players. Veterans will realise that it still borrows from older games like Ninety-Nine and Watten, but the progressive revelation of one's hand during the bidding is definitely original. Modest penalties for missing contract encourage an aggressive approach.

Mu is up there with 500 as one of the best trick taking games but is best with 5 players (500 is probably better with 4 or of course Tichu). The dual trumps and the bidding system give a lot of scope of all kinds of clever subtle play, at the cost of making my head hurt with the complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
200 points is definitely too much--the game went on for at least a couple hours.  If playing to 100 I'd probably rate it an 8.  It's similar to Spades, but with some interesting little twists, particularly in the bidding.  I like trick-taking games and I like playing with five, so this game fills a nice niche for me.  It's hard to make much progress on the vice team--there is a real risk/reward dynamic with the game and it's difficult for someone as risk-averse as I am. (1 play)

Mü: Complex trick taking game. I think it's similar to Japanese Napoleon: www.pagat.com/picture/napoleon.html.
The Last Panther: Nice little Hearts variant that works well with three.
Wimmuln: Like Oh Hell, but better, because it's less predictable and trick values count more.
Rummü: Rummy variant played with the Mü deck. We liked it, although the rules translation is a bit unclear and has a typo in the scores section. I'll never play Canasta again.

1st played 01/24/07. There seems to be a lot of effort in making the rules of this complicated to learn. Once you have it, it does seem like an interesting game to play. If you have an understanding of trick taking and card memory of what's played that will help as well. Since there are often two trumps, it gets a bit confusing and there seems to be a lot of little nuances in the game as well.  Determining what you bid should be based on what's in your hand may be a little tricky as well.  Overall it's well worth a game play. Just make sure you play a 2nd time before evaluating it.  (1st played Panther 05/10/07. It's very similar to Hearts. Two black 7's are bad, reds are minus 10 each, yellows are plus 5, and the other cards have no value. Cards from 10-2 are played in that order, must follow suit, and no shooting the moon. It's a good game to play as a filler and pretty fun.  I'd recommend giving it a try.) (1st played WimmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ln 3/18/08. rated 7, good oh hell variant with Mu deck) (1st played SafarÃ¼ 4/3/08. Rated 6, collect card similar to 7 Safari)

My favorite trick-taking game. The gameplay is in the bidding just as much as the card play -- more so with a group who knows the game well. The idea of there being two trumps each had is cool, and I'm surprised I haven't seen it in more games -- but the key thing is that bidding reveals info about your hand. This game has lots of depth and is quite addictive once you get the hang of it.

(Rating based on 2 plays.  A fun trick-taking game that my non-gaming relatives related to as a "more compicated" Euchre.  The game certainly has more going on than Euchre and would be more interesting for gamers.  On the other hand, it also makes the game more inaccessible to non-gamers.  Still it went over fairly well with 2 of the 3 non-gamers I've introduced it to.

RATING: 6
This is a collection of games based on a single deck of cards.  Most of the games are similar, though not identical to, standard card games, and I will compare them below.  The deck has five suits with numbers from 0 to 9; each suit has two ones and two sevens.

Mu is fairly unique, but it is most similar to sheepshead.  Bidding cards instead of numbers allows other players to see what people have, and it is an interesting twist.  Game play is fairly complex since there are five suits with two trump, and possibly a double trump card.  Trump may be a suit or a number.  For a card game, this is quite good.  However, it will take a while for players to get used to the bidding system and the way play proceeds.  Rating: 6, but further playing with expereinced players may increase this.

Black Panther is similar to Hearts, but simply more brutal.  The net score for each hand is -110, and the game ends when someone reaches -250.  The winner is the player who has the highest score at this point.  The instructions do note that this is best with 3 players, and I agree.  With more players, the weaker player or the unlucky player gets dumped on.  Score: 5, and not likely to improve much.

The Last Panther is very easy to teach and play. You can teach it under 3 minutes and playtime is around 30 minutes. 

My friends say it is VERY similar to Hearts, a game I have never played.

The decisions needed in the game, aren’t very complex, but you do have to think your moves.

Best with 3 players. 

I find the game to be pleasant, but my desire to play it again is rather low.

Years ago I really wanted to play all the games in the system, now, my desire to play them is very low.

The rules of the game could be a lot clearer, Mü`s rules aren’t very complex but the rulebook is hard to read. Once you know the rules, you can teach it in only 6 minutes. Playtime is around 70 minutes, way too much for what the game offers. 

It seems the game has a lot of depth, but so far, it escapes me. I definitively need to play it more times to understand it better, but I’m not sure if I will.

Mü offers twists I have never seen in a trick taking game. I like the variable partnerships and the double trump system (this is very novel for me, although the game is from years ago). 

Best with 4 players.

Bottom line. I have drifted away from trick taking games, perhaps I will give the game another chance to woe me.

RGG edition.  With double 1s and 7s, selected partners, double trump suits and/or numbers, and an uneven distribution of pips to score, all combine to make up this unique version of an otherwise traditional trick-taking card game.  This game definitely gains in depth and texture with more play and I feel like I'm just starting to 'get' the full mechanics.  Unfortunately I'm no longer able to find 4-6 players for a f2f game of Mu.    

Now that I have Mu loaded on my iTouch/iPad... I have enough (AI) players to play ... anytime.  I've played the iPod version enough to feel that the 5 player game is THE ultimate sweet spot.

An interesting (sort of)partnership game played with 5 players. The problem I have with it is once a leader is established no one wants to partner up with him. So he is forced into taking the chief role or scavenging points on the sub chiefs team. If he is chief and his partner is remotely close to him in scoring the partner has incentive to have his team set since it only impacts the chief for making a "bad" bid. I prefer partnership games where my partner is really my partner.

7 years later and I finally played Mü. Probably a very good trick-taking which needs the right group. We had two experienced players who ran away with the game and three novices. Two of our five rounds were decided from the start by freaking good hands of a player, a third was a blowout by a random perfect choice of partnership. Only two games were close. The experienced players assured us that a game like this is highly unlikely.

I hope so as the bidding and the resulting two vs. three partnership trick-taking is intriguing. Probably 8/10, for now a 7.
---
Only played Last Panther so far which probably is among the weakest games of this collection.

Last Panther: Each round has -110 points in sum. The two black 7's count as -50 points each. You have to pass the buck but the player to your left will decide if you have any chance by passing three cards to you before the round starts. This game will be frustrating as it is not unusual that a player will be out of contention within one single round without making obvious mistakes. Not recommended (5/10).

This baby is hot! I've played my share of Euchre, Hearts, Sheepshead, and Gang of Four, but Mu is the new BOMB of trick-takers in my life. 5-player Sheepshead is a hell of a game, but Mu takes it up a notch in terms of strategy. I think the tactical aspect of playing tricks is similar, but the strategy of the bidding and the trump selection is a beautiful thing. 

Update: I still love the game, but the complexity lends itself to longer games, longer hands, longer tricks. Part of what I love about Sheepshead is the rapid pace of the game. Mu plays at a much more thoughtful pace. I am curious to see if it speeds up with experience, but I have doubts.

Complicated trick-taking game with poor rules. The game is actually quite decent if you play with people who know the rules. The charts can be a bit daunting, but overall there's a solid game underneath. Half the game is bidding to be the chief or making yourself attractive to the chief, while the other half is standard trick-taking.

The other games (Mehr) are actually pretty decent. So it makes for a good mix of card games.

Mü has an interesting bidding mechanism similar to that of Skat, but easier to understand. A team game in which everybody also plays for themselves.

Mu - Excellent game and worth the price of purchase alone. Its a partnership trick taking game where you bid for partners and trump selection. - 8

Last Panther - Anti-Trick taking game where people who win tricks a lot mostly loose points. It works very well, and goes over perfectly with 3 (Which Mu doesn't do). - 7

Wimmuln - Simple variant on Wizard that IMHO, doesn't work as well due to the fact that the penalty for missing your bid isn't as dramatic as Wizard. - 3

Safaru - A variant on Casino with some funky scoring that makes things slightly more interesting. Its a good 10 minute filler but nothing to write home about - 5

Rummu - I haven't tried this yet mainly because it looks like a simple rummy variant and its probably not as good as my other rummy variants.

[LUP 12-Dec-2006] A difficult one to rate given that there are five games within.  We used to play five player [i]Mü[/i] at lunchtime for a while, but one of our players hated it.  If he wasn't there we would play [i]Tichu[/i] instead.  Currently we play [i]Last Panther[/i] a lot with three or five players generally.  As an old [i]Hearts[/i]/[i]Spades[/i]/[i]Black Bitch[/i] player I don't like the Green 5 start card rule much because it is way too easy due to luck of the deal and pass to be lumbered with a lot of points on the initial lead.  The standard rule of the lowest card of a suit would be better in my opinion.  That said we still play it.

I have still not played "Mu" itself -- finding 5 who want to play a somewhat involved trick-taking game is a bit hard.  I have now played "Safaru" (with 2), and "Wimmuln" (with 3 and 4) and "The Last Panther" (with 3 and 4).  The latter two I found quite fun, if a bit lacking in depth.  I look forward to trying Mu someday...

My rating is for the above three games, not including "Mu" or "Rummu".

UPDATE: Having now played "Wimmuln" and "The Last Panther" a few more times, I have increased my rating from 6 to 7.  They're really quite good trick-taking games.  They're just a bit different from the ones you might be used to (which is good!) so it takes a while to see the depth of it.

Of the games in the set, I've only played a few, most often the Last Panther.  It's very similar to Hearts or the Chinese "Flush the Pig" game, where you take tricks and try to avoid various bad cards.  It's very similar in flavor to those games, though there's an extra consideration of winning positive points for taking the last trick.  The hands play pretty quickly, but the default end condition results in some fast games ended by one or two bad hands.

I also had some fun playing Safaru, which requires the use of the triangular point markers on the cards.  It only required some simple math to deal with the luck of the draw.

The collection of games seems pretty fun and quite affordable, not too easily replaceable by other random decks of cards.

Of course, it's a rip off on a common game, but I prefer this game. First because you are not limited to 4 player only. Second, it's all the player vs the team. Third, you can see some of other people's card on the table. So I think it plays better than the original game.

The only drawback I have seen so far, I think there are too much thrumph suit making normal cards almost useless. 2nd with with 6 players you generally get most of the time a very bad hand, so I would say that the maximum number of players should be 5.

A great 5-handed "unpredictably fun", bidding trick- taking game.  A fabulous concept where each hand begins with an auction phase when anyone can bid for the right to select one of two possible trumps (up to 2 trump "suits" are determined by simply revealing "bid" cards from their hand).  Scoring mechanism is very good too.

Played one of the available games...some decent card games but I'm thinking 5 suits is still one too many, particularly with 6 people.  I appreciated the two different trumps, one decided by the chief and the other by the vice, but it certainly makes figuring out how much to bid and how to play to take the needed points (the triangles on the card) difficult.  I really liked playing with five people, perhaps that is a more appropriate size group to play this game as it balances out the hands more.

This game evokes bridge for me, of which I am a huge fan, but it disappoints on many levels. Keeping track of the triangles is a chore, switching partners regularly is annoying, and the trump suit "combinations" are difficult to understand. I'll stay with bridge.

Mu = rate it a "10."  Other game in the package rate lower:  Wimmuln (9), Safaru (6), Last Panther (6), Rummu (7).  Excellent value and beautiful artwork.  Great game(s)!

RATING: 8
I think Mu is THE definitive 5-player trick-taking game. The constant shifting of teams, the initial bidding makes for some highly strategic play within the overall round which leads to some really tactical decisions once teams have been assigned. It can take a little getting used to but this game sings once everyone understands the various implications as to the visible cards. Wonderful!

You need to play this with the same group over and over to get enjoyment out of this.

Even though I rate this a 3, if I was stranded on an island with 4 other people, I would bring this game.

RATING: 7
A very complex trick taking game.  You bid with cards to become Chief.  The second highest becomes Vice Chief.  Chief and Vice Chief name trump, either color or number and then the chief picks a partner and tries to make the bid.  The Vice and other players try to stop the chief.  

I found the game very interesting but it is definitely a skill game that rewards repeated plays.

Mu is a good game I don't get much opportunity to play. I tend to either be with a group of traditional card players who look askew at the funky deck or with a group of gamers who'd rather not play a traditional-style card game.

There are a bunch of features I like about this game (hidden partnership, two flavors of trump, tactical depth). On the negative side, a score table is a design wart.

RATING: 9
Great Game that solves the two biggest shortcomings of the classic german popular card game "Skat":
1. Mü can be played with varying player numbers. (Skat is only for 3)
2. Mü allows you to to bid as high as you dare. So if you have a good hand, you are likely to decide what is trump. (In Skat you can have a great hand, but an opponent with an average hand can bid the game away from you.)
There are some complex mechanics, but they are well worth learning.
Explaining the game for the first time was a nightmare (for me and my audience).

Ugh. Play wizard if you want to bid on tricks you think you want to take, or Tichu if you want partnerships. This one probably plays ok with 4, but with more players it's a case of 2vs The world, which feels very unbalanced -- bidding should rarely go about 1-2 in those cases. Definitely not my cup of tea.

A solid 8. Somebody said that with 4, go with Tichu, with 5, take Mü. After the Chinese game, this one is probably the best strictly card game - I like it better than Bridge. Lots of strategies, with many ways to mitigate a bad hand. The rate can go higher after some plays. And Black Panther is a fantastic game for a larger group.

By far and away the best card game out there.  Takes a few rounds to discover the hidden strategies, but this game has amazing staying power.  Our gaming group played this for over a year everyday at lunch.  We discovered new strategies daily. Even when you may have a seemingly lousy hand you can still have fun 'advertising' (laying out cards to support the chief's trump suit) in hopes of being picked as the chief's partner. Or even better, win the chief's favor (and hopefully his partnership) by cancelling out the vice with matching cards.

Mu: Great trick taking game from Doris and Frank. Players bid to have the right to call trump. Second place is vice, they call secondary trump, first place bidder is chief, calls primary trump and chooses a partner. I would rate this higher if it wasn't for the fact that once someone gets close to 200 pts, kingmaker problems may arise.  I like the idea of the rules adjustment where the game could end randomly on a die roll after players have crossed a threshold to prevent the syndrome of avoiding partnering with the leader(s). I haven't played the various other games included in the box.

I forget the Mu game's name I played but it was a trick taking game. It was a lot of fun having very variable trumps and having to figure out the rule based on hints. Nothing too special though.

I don't generally care for trump games.  Need to play this one more to decide if this one can be an exception or not.
---update---
It's growing on me...but I still feel the scoring is a bit too much of a sledgehammer.  There is little fine grain available - you either score a ton or you don't.  And there may be too few hands for a dry spell to run its course.  Still, bumped up to 7 because I enjoy the mental gymnastics this one has me doing.

Mü features very unusual mechanics in a trick-taking card game, with a layer of indirection in scoring. I only played a learning game, and now I'm even more keen to play a real one. The other games featured in the manual don't look very interesting.
-----
It's as though every aspect of a trick-taking game were deconstructed and reconstrued: novel bidding mechanic, novel contract, novel trump selection, novel set of cards that constitutes trump, novel scoring. A card game that Rei Kawakubo would make if she designed card games. Just excellent.
-----
In particular I appreciate all the calculating and the flux during the auction. There is such a delicious mix of tension. You want to see who has a compatible set of cards, but only if you are not vice (because otherwise chief will poach your compatible partner); but you want to be vice so that you can get the most value from your cards; but you only want to be vice if your cards can hurt the prospective chief; but who knows who the prospective chief will be; and maybe *you* could be chief, but that would mean a bid of 6 cards and that's too many triangles; but maybe that's OK because you'd get close and maybe lose 10 points on the contract scoring, which you could regain on the triangles scoring; but oh, you can't choose the best partner because that person has decided to vie for vice, so maybe you shouldn't bid 6; meanwhile, who has the other 9, the guy who never bids because he doesn't grok the auction or the wily veteran?... yikeys! No wonder this game is so beloved!

RATING: 10
The good rating comes alone for the monumental Mü: a trick-taking game, known to reach its ideal balance with five players, that offers the meatiest, most thrilling and original auction phase I know in the genre: the best bidder leads a contract and chooses a trump set and a partner, and the second best bidder chooses a second set as a "trump extension". Players bid showing cards from their hands, revealing information to detent other players from bidding or to put themselves on the line as potential partners of the leader. The tactical and strategic scope of this phase is nothing short of wondrous. The card play is more predictable but still pert: the cards with higher values don't necessarily bring the biggest amount of points towards reaching the contract. Suit must be followed.

The "more" in the title are two adaptations of known games (Rummy and Casino) for this specific card deck and a game for children; they're all pleasant games but completely overshadowed by the miraculous main course in this package.

RATING: 7
This is a hard game to play well, which may be the reason why it's attractive. Knowing how and what to bid based on who's going to be the vice and what the under trump might be, or choosing to prostitute yourself to the would-be chiefs seems to be the key. With 5 suits spread across 5 hands, it's highly unlikely to get a winning hand yourself, so it's all about the bid declarations. As a result, it's slower than I'd prefer, and perhaps a bit too luck-based in the final analysis. For a game that’s thought well of, it rarely hits the table here, and there lies the rub. When suggested, it usually procures groans at the thought of having to get our heads wrapped around the bid repercussions once more.

Probably my favorite card game. A trick taking game that changes partners and strategy at each round. You must first show part of your hand in order to determine who is chief and vice and then based on that the vice chooses a trump and then the chief chooses a partner and another trump. The chief and his partner then try to achieve a predetermined number of points against the others. The teams change from round to round, as does the goal and the trumps.

Rating is for Mu only.  This trick-taking game feels a little like Spades, except that it is at its best with 5 people.  The bidding phase is a little bit confusing, and seems to be as much about information sharing as trying to be the chief.  The concept of a 2-part "trump suit" is also a little confusing.  I've found that the chief leading trumps can be a little overpowered, particularly if both trumps are numbers.

Mü = excellent partnership auction/bidding & trick-taking game.  Rating: 8.5

Wimmüln (like Oh Hell) = looks pretty interesting, with the variation on bidding.  Played one hand; worth trying again later.  Rating: 8

Last Panther (like Hearts) = Played Jun/06: didn't feel enough different from Hearts to warrant repeat plays.  Rating: 5

Rummü (like Rummy) = unplayed.  Can't figure out the scoring; seems very much like partial Rummy, and crazy with jokers (the entire yellow suit).  I can't see myself playing this.

I do not know which game we played, but it was a trick-taking game with bidding the position. After that you could choose either a number or colour as a trump.

My rating has gone down a little. I used to think this game was genius but I now realize that (for me) all the true genius of the game is in the bidding mechanism and the actual cardplay is just grueling activity.  Though I still think the bidding is a work of art, the game is much less satisfying to me now.  Further, if you play this game with any players who tend to avoid risk, the slaughter is torturous to participate in.

I love the mechanics of trick-taking but the bidding for Chief and Vice and scoring is just too much for my tastes and for my circle of players (who are happy with Canyon and Die Sieben Siegel); other card games included (only one tried) for those interested makes this card game good value for money.

The game is too complex for casual gamers and too light for the bridge crowd. With 5 players completely familiar with this type of game (and having, at least, half a brain) this is a great experience but it just never happens. Unfortunately this game fits in between Wizard and Bridge and there just aren't enough players interested in this .

I have to agree with the assessment that this is one of the best trick-taking games around, if not the best. My only complaint is that without any sort of bidding conventions, it is very hard to decide what to bid. If there were any such conventions it would make a great game even greater.

The rating is primarily for Last Panther (as are most of the recorded games as well) -- I would rate Mü as 8. Last Panther does great job in making all five suits very different in nature despite being a simple trick-taking game. I prefer both Panther and Mü with 4-5 players.

RATING: 10
Feb 2017: Upgraded from 9 to 10. Best trick taking game designed in the last 30 years. Strategic tips for newbies:
1. When in doubt, be Chief's partner
2. Bid aggressively (this dramatically improves the game)

2015-12-30: I think I know why I prefer traditional trick taking games (i.e. Skat, Tarot) over this: There's too much information revealed during the bidding round! Too much information revealed means less surprise and less "work" required for players to achieve their contracts!

2013-12-30: Dropped from 10 to 9. The trick play is not as compelling as other games. The distribution of trump cards tends to be too even because opposing teams both pick what the trump suit consists of.

2012-04-17: Best bidding mechanism ever! Players can communicate a lot of information about their hands but, unlike Bridge, do not have to memorize any bidding conventions.

Players must communicate with their potential partners and potential opponents because your opponents get to (partially) pick a trump suit too!

Unfortunately, the trick taking game play is less interesting. I find there is less scope for deductive or sacrificial game play that you typically find in Bridge, French Tarot, or Skat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(Only played Mu)
The upside:
-Five different games to try and potential to come up with your own games. The deck lends itself to it.
-Mu refreshes what traditional (and trick-taking) card games bring to the table, with initial bidding for Chief, who will choose the trump, which I like, and with whom will he make partnership, which I like even more.
-Different partnerships being formed throughtout the game is great. You're trying to win, but along the way you'll have to cooperate with everyone.
-It's a little trickier/complex than the normal card game.

The downside:
-Maybe requiring 5 players to shine is his only weakness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow-- a surprisingly great game!  The complexity here is a bit off-putting to a few players in our group, but this one may become my favorite trick-taker ever.  The bidding is brilliant, and I feel like I am only scratching the surface strategically. 

The only problem is that there are not a lot of "heavy" card players in our group, so it may take a bit of time to get used to this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
More interesting than the usual trick-taking card game, with some unusual twists, but I found the scoring table needlessly complex, and the game has to overcome my general disinterest in trick-taking card games, which it doesn't quite do.  I'd play it again, no problem there, but I'd probably choose something else first.

RATING: 8
In Mu, players set cards on the table in order place their bids.  The player who wins the bid gets to determine one type of trump and heads one team; the player who picks trump also gets to pick one player to be her/his partner.  The player who was second closest to winning the bid says a secondary trump and leads a second team comprised of everyone else.  

The special Mu deck has marks on the cards the denote how many points each card is worth and the player either try to stop players from making their bid or they try to make their bid.

Mu has an interesting twist on the typical trick taking game in that each player is scored individually.  Only one person will win and your partner isn't going to be your partner forever.  While it is an interesting twist, I do not like that aspect as much as I like the partners for a whole game aspect of a game like Pinochle.  It's fun to build up camaraderie over the whole course of a game and to work as a team.

I love trick taking games and Mu is no exception.  Played with five, there is a neat balance between which team has strength.

My rating is for Mu, the only game I played in the set.  I rated it a six cause I can see the attraction, but frankly my play experience was much lower.

RATING: 7
After playing this with a more receptive group, I've increased Mu's rating from 5.

The bidding portion distinguishes Mu from other trick-taking games I've played. Before each hand, players bid on the chance to become the Chief, the Vice, or the Chief's Partner. Bidding entails laying cards down from one's hand face-up on the table. At the end of bidding whoever has bid the most cards becomes the Chief. Whoever bid second-most becomes Vice.

Both Chief and Vice choose a trump suit, the Chief's trump being the higher of the two. Additionally, the Chief chooses a partner from among the other players (not the Vice), with whom he works for the opportunity to win bonus points. If Chief-Partner team meets the bonus condition, set by the number of cards the chief bid, the Chief and Partner each earn bonus points. If not, the Chief loses points, the partner receives no bonus points, and everyone else gains points.

The Chief and Chief's partner will change frequently round-to-round, which creates an interesting situation: every player is out for himself, but must occasionally partner with another for mutual benefit, since the amount of points potentially earned by the Chief/Chief's partner team exceeds the amount of points the two players would earn individually.

This rating applies only to Mu; I haven't tried the other games in the box yet.  Mu is the best five player card game I've encountered; the description I've seen of "five player bridge" is quite accurate.  The only problems I have with the game are that, if you're dealt bad cards, there's not much you can do about it, and the horrible endgame problem.  The second problem is easily fixed, however.

SO far I have only tried Mü from this pack of five games. It is a trick taking game where the players bid for the chance to set the trump. I guess this is similar to bridge where you promise to get a certain amount of tricks. The bidding in Mü seems to be the core of the game. How much risk you are willing to take to make some extra points. To me it seems that the part about taking the tricks is only exciting to whoever is the chief. He is in control and needs to make the decisions. Others more or less just play along. The two trumps are also quite confusing at least for beginners.

Another game in tha pack is called 'The Last Panther'. It's one of the better trick-taking games and involves a lot of laughter when a player receives a lot of minus points within one trick.

Fantastic value with a nice spread of games in the one box.
Mü - 9 - Bidding can be as interesting as the second part of the round - playing the cards for points. I'm enjoying this one greatly and every game is an experience - enjoyable, tense, interactive, different. The end rounds can be doubly thought provoking as in a close game the leader has to choose his partner very carefully if bidding to be Chief. Very fortunate to have had someone explain the rules to me, otherwise I could still be sitting around wondering what's what. Speeds up nicely with more plays and experienced players. Lots to get your head around, but it rewards the effort. It might just be my favourite card game.
WimmÃƒÂ¼ln - 6 - good predictive fun.

The game Bridge should have been. The auction round is full of signals of whether you'd like to be Chief/Vice/none, whether you're supporting, or bluffing all the above, and what you see in the bid is what you get, unlike all those secret bidding conventions in Bridge. The revolving partnerships keep things fresh and introduce cooperative and backstabbing possibilities.

Azt kell mondanom óriási Wizard rajongóként, hogy tényleg a Mü az ütésszerző kártyajátékok királya. Óriási játék! Nem szeretem a licitálós játékokat, de nagyon jól kitalált az elnökségért, alelnökségért menő harc. A két adu ötlete, a bónuszpontok. Azt gondolná a szabály magyarázatakor a játékos, hogy ez már sok és nagyon bonyolult a játék, de nem kell félni. Pár kör után simán bele tud rázódni az, aki kártyázik. Nem tudom milyen lehet más játékosszámmal, de öten tökéletesen működött, nagyon nagy élmény volt. Perfekt. 9 pont.

Kipróbáltuk még az Utolsó párducot is, ami a Fekete macska változata. Ugyanolyan élmény is a két játék. Amiatt mert simán lehet benne szívatni a másikat sose lesz a kedvencem, de levezetőnek elmegy. 6 pont.

Összességében adok egy 8 pontot, de ez főleg a Münek szól.

A very creative trick taking game, that allows people to manipulate how the game is played, but still feels too random for me.  This is a great example of what I don't like in straight trick taking games. Most of the time I feel I'm just throwing out what I think could win in the meat-grinder and seeing what comes out on the other side.  I usually need something more to offset the lack of control and add reliance of decision making solely on bids. I respect the design, but this just isn't my kind of "fun".

Really, really like the bridge type bidding combined with the constantly changing partnerships.  Cautious aggression is the keyword here.

[RGG 2003 edition] {Animal; trick-taking, partnership} Mü and More is an attractive trick-taking and unique game. It includes 4 games in the box but I only like Mü.

The first game was interesting and I didn't personally didn't understand anything. That's maybe because of my background with Bridge and I felt it difficult to grasp the concept of TWO trumps.

I have been a euchre player for almost 10 years, and I recently came across Mu.  This is a truly excellent trick-taking game, where there is more to do than just get your hand and play almost robotically (a la euchre).  The only drawbacks to this game are that it is not short, and once you get addicted to it, there are no online versions of it (that I'm aware).  WIsh that this would be picked up by BSW.

Beyond Mu, I have also played Safaru a bunch of times, and Wimmuln a few times as well.  Safaru is pretty good, Wimmuln is ok, but neither compares to Mu.

This is a game I will always play.

There are multiple trump cards each round, there is a partnership aspect that changes from round to round, there's bidding. Once you get past all of that, it's pretty straight-forward trick-taking cardplay.

Mue is a great game! The trump rules can be a bit tough to grasp at first, but if you enjoy trick-taking games, you must try it. The Last Panther is an excellent Hearts variant, better than the game it's based on (and Hearts is my favorite public domain card game). Calcory, and Safarü are very good. Wimmüln is okay, but I think Oh Hell is better.

Trick taking game that has alot going on.  The auction in this game is a game in itself.  Plus the number of essential suits expands up to 6 different suits, and retracts down to 4 suits.  One play, and I'm pretty sure we played quite poorly.  Alot of fun, I am hoping to get a chance to hammer away on this one. (My rating for Mu... maybe will get around to other games in here, but doubtful)  The bidding game is a subgame with finesse and strategy on its own, plus the hand recognition and card play.  Super good.  Recommended for any fan of trick taking games.  Wow, there is alot to uncover.  Each game(3 now) I've learned quite a good bit on how to bid, when to bid, and how to read others bid.  Cool.

Trick-taking card games are a genre upon themselves. Some people like it, others hate it. Mu and Mehr is a good game, but player skills must be balanced to win games. If one player can memorize card hands and has a good grasp of the game, then game play is unbalanced. If all players are skilled, then this game will certainly be a duel!

Wow and wow again.  This game almost immediately won over my bridge four.  This game removes the tedious-to-memorize conventions that bind bridge and adds a couple of additional layers of complexity that make it incredibly compelling for those who love trick taking games.

Rated after 1 WindMül and 30 confirmed Last Panther games, the Last Panther is the trick game that I'd like to play most in this packet. There is a nice mixture of bluffing, teasing and using the skills. Giving the cards before the first round is a nice touch and very important part of the game. The game itself is quite simple, not so many special rules, so it is easy to learn and play. Of course there is a learning curve, but you should be able to recognize the bad moves during the first game. Works well with different number of players. A trick taking game with five suites, which all are different.

Bought for 4 € from a Facebook marketplace.

As of yet I've only tried safarü (both basic and reversed rules) but It seems Mü will stay!

Bonus points for H loving this game. : )

2 plays.  With two trumps, partnerships, and a convoluted bidding mechanism, this game is on the lower end of the scale for trick-taking games with me.  Bidding with cards is fine, but the strength of your hand is based entirely on you winning the bid, and if you're unwilling to push it up to some ridiculously high bid, you won't be able to call trump.  It seems very backwards to me, and frustrating.  If not for the fact that you can play other games with the deck, I would have traded it away.

The ultimate partnership, bidding, trick-taking game. Quite a bit to wrap your head around as the game stretches the genre in almost every possible dimension: 5 suits instead of 4, changing partnerships with individual scoring, two trump suits almost every hand, and more. At 4 games we're down to 1 1/2 hrs. Definitely worth the investment! We like this more each time we play!

Mü: Trick-taking, teams are determined by bidding. Needs some plays to have an idea of the bidding.
The Last Panther: Trick-taking similar to Hearts, so taking tricks is usually bad.

Coming from Gang of Four, I was sort of expecting this game to not be as complicated as it appears, but, from what I can tell, this is pretty much what I can learn to expect from these kinds of card games.  I will just have to pop open a martini and figure it out.

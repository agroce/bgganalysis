RATING: 10
Great game. Lots of variety with many different warlords (may be too many at times) to build decks around. Adding the d20 throws in a bit of luck so any deck has a decent chance of winning.

DnD light style rules for a card game.  Sometimes a bit too fast depending on the warlord.  A lot of room to explore.

Very cool implementation of D20 dice system.  Theme and factions are relatively unique and interesting.

RATING: 9
It's an extraordinarily good game.  I would rate this as a 10, except for the fact that I absolutely hated some of the sets and some of the rules that came with later sets.

This is probably the funnest game I've ever played.

RATING: 9.5
Probably my favorite CCG game (although with 4th edition it is now not collectible - another big bonus). Lots of different strategies for the different races and classes of Warlords, really scratches the D&D itch. Plays almost a like a small miniatures game with the different ranks of characters. Fantastic Art!

We picked up a few decks and boosters, a nice balanced little bundle, and then got out of the game while we still could.  Nifty implementation of d20 for cards -- but I hate collectibles!

RATING: 5
Only tried with the demo decks - game is vaguely interesting and D20 combat mechanic helps to balance the cards - but nothing here grabbed me, and it's a CCG which is a downside for me. If this was marketed as an expandable game and you could buy a faction in a box (like blue moon) I'd want to play it.

A fun CCG with interesting rules that are easy to learn. Though I think that saying that the approx. playing time is only 10 minutes is wrong - I'd say the game lasts for at least 20 min up to 30. Anyway, it's a good game with lots of fun in it!

I normally don't play CCG's but I like this one. It's sort of like having an AD&D skirmish miniatures battle going on. Assassin's Strike expansion adds a lot of powerful cards and makes the game more freewheeling.

RATING: 9
My all-time favorite CCG. If you know how to play D&D, you already know how to play Warlord! I played 1st - 3rd Editions and still have all of my cards, just waiting for the day that I can get someone to play with me again.

RATING: 6
My second least favourite of AEG's CCGs after L5R. Despite that, I did spent a significant amount of money and time playing this because all of my gaming group was. 

Game was OK but I didn't like the extreme randomness of the d20 which could easily steal a defeat from the jaws of victory by sheer random chance. Fortunately as the game was expanded, more combolicious cards and thus available scenarios opened up which allowed a deck to rely less on luck and more on strategy and good deckbuilding.

Another annoying point was how AEG's greediness not only killed it (imho), but it made the competitive game relying extremely much on rare cards.

This was a vaguely D20 inspired CCG that came out at the height of the Wizards D&D Open Gaming License craziness. Overall it is a fun little game that would probably make it as a D&D based LCG or something but not really as a CCG in today's market.  We had some fun with it when it came out.

I like CCGs.  This one just does nothing for me, having to roll a D20 for everything just seems too random.

If you have an actual tuned deck, the end result is having 20 cards in play that you have to do mathematical formulas on to figure out what your stats are.

I played Warlord CCG since the old times. Got much fun in friendly plays, but also gaming satisfaction in European / World Challenges.

The system of "Big Guys" challenges give the game a special taste. Not only simple match with your friends or tournament team mates.
You can spend your efforts in try to kill down legendary charachters in 3 different "levels" of difficulty, rarity and Uniquity.

d20 the gathering. Simple, yet workable mechanics. There are balance issues with several cards from several sets. Campaign edition addresses that problem, but 'Open' is still problematic. The art ranges from mediocre to nicely done. The graphic design is simple and functional. Warlord plays well in limited (sealed deck) formats.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

RATING: 7
Warlord: Saga of the Storm hat uns 2001 sehr viel Spaß gemacht. Das Konzept einen Warlord zu haben, um den sich das gesamte Deck dreht war neu und spannend. Und auch die Art und Weise, wie man neue Kreaturen ins Spiel gebracht hat: In Warlord gab es nämlich Ränge und je höher das Level eines Charakters war, desto weiter weg vom "Kampfgeschehen" kam er ins Spiel. Das war wirklich cool und brachte viele taktische Möglichkeiten. Auch die Fraktionen gefielen uns sehr, denn es war für Jeden etwas dabei (Orks, Nekromantische Elfen, Düstere Ritter usw). Warlord hatte allerdings von Anfang an ein Problem: Die schwankende Qualität der Artworks. Mal sahen sie fantastisch aus und mal wie hingekrakelt. Nachdem wir Warlord ein paar Jahre gespielt hatten, kam dann das nächste Problem: Das Spiel schaffte es nicht sich weiter zu entwickeln. Jeder neue Warlord der veröffentlicht wurde, fühlte sich an, als hätte man die Fähigkeiten schonmal gesehen. Auch die (Deck-)Strategien der einzelnen Fraktionen änderten sich nur in Nuancen. So verlor Warlord bald seinen Reiz in unserer Runde.

Picked up a couple starters when this first came out. I loved choosing a Warlord and building an army around him, but the rules were so messy and filled with errors that we eventually found the game to be unplayable. Even some cards had glaring typos and contradictions. This could have been an amazing game if more time had been spent on quality assurance.

Great theme, beautiful artwork and the most unique combat / formation engine I've ever seen in a card game. The randomness allowed by the d20 rolling allows for a level playing field even in games where the matches look one-sided. May be the best fantasy CCG ever created

RATING: 4
Based on one play: Start off with an army of cards which can each attack once (unless specified otherwise) and with five cards. Play back and forth till no one can play and then refill your hand. The fact that you gain no cards after each action makes the game dull as you have to perform all the actions possible before getting other options, instead of choosing what to do. Many cards often cannot even be used. Not really worth a try, especially if you play the better games in this genre.

Warlord: Sara of the Storm is a game which provided innumerable days of play with one of my best friends. Surprisingly fun play is had from the 'ranked troops' mechanism, as long as both sides have access to a large and varied pool of cards. I'd actually rate this a full point higher if not for its critical flaw: it's very uneven. But that's all right in some cases and I think that this is one of them: when you're looking for lots of fun and modest amount of thinking, balanced by a good helping of luck so that skill is rewarded, yet there's also a sense of 'who knows where this will go?'. Glad to have picked up a large collection on the cheap once it was very late in the life of the game, that's a great way to enjoy a CCG with friends.

RATING: 8.1
Two Player Value = Excellent


Warlord is simply my favorite CCG.

So first let's discuss the bad.  This was a Collectable Card Game and suffers all the negatives that CCG's typically suffer.  Plus, it is now a dead CCG.  

Being a dead CCG can either be good or bad.  It is good because it is really cheap to get into, but bad because it might be hard to find cards.

I have played Warlord since its creation, so I have plenty of cards.  However, since then I have sold all my cards so now only have my built tournament decks that I kept to play.  They will never change now and will remain static just for fun play.

Warlord is a CCG that represents a battle between two armies set in the D&D universe.  Therefore, it uses many of the D&D rules.

Because Warlord is set in the Dungeon & Dragon universe, the game is closely tied to a story line.  It is an ongoing story that progresses and changes with each expansion release.  Additionally, as the Overlords and Medusan Lords were defeated by players the story line would progress.  In this since the players had a say in what direct the story went.

For me the D&D universe was one of the biggest draws to the game.  All the character classes, leveling, items and actions are things that I was already familiar with from playing Dungeon & Dragons.  It makes getting into the game easy.

The "Rank and File" system is unique to Warlord and is what handles combat between the two armies.  It is a very clean and simple system and handles the different types of combat brilliantly.  Melee strikers go to the front rank while range strikers and magic-users sit protected in the back.

Actual combat uses the D&D base d20 system.  Easy.

The various characters use D&D battle to hack and slash the enemy army and characters.  While battling character can level and improve as well as gain and equip items and use special actions.

Players battle until one player wades through the opposing army and kills the the other Warlord for victory.

The game is fought with six different factions and four different character classes.  Each faction specializes in a certain trait or aspect and certain classes.  For example, the Nothrog are typically Orcs, Ogres and Goblins and so are strong melee fighters and are often fighters and barbarians.  In contrast, the Deverenians are Human and specialize in magic and are usually mages, illusionists and clerics.   While one faction might be stronger in a given field, all factions can do all things and have access to all classes.

Deck building is easy in Warlord.  Simply pick a Warlord for the faction you wish to play and the class you want to play within.  Add characters of that faction and some items and actions to support your army and you are off fighting.  

A new player can build a deck and start playing in no time.  He can even be challenging to experienced players as many of the more powerful cards are common.  

The artwork has always been wonderful.

Warlord has gone through too many expansions to mention.  Each added new characters, items, actions, skills, sub-classes, etc.  I enjoyed and use cards from all the expansions.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additionally Warlord offered accelerated challenges which I believe was one of the best and coolest things about the game overall.  It gave the game a goal and helped Progress the story behind the game.

Each tournament offered what was called an Overlord challenge after the tournament was over.  The winner got the first attempt to beat the Overlord then went the down the line of finishers.  

Overlord challenges are difficult and were defeated rarely.

Overlords are more powerful versions of Warlords.  Overlords are higher level and use more powerful items and actions.  Many Overlords simply brake the rules of the game and do things not normally allowed.  An Overlord challenge would run for a few months then a new Overlord would come to offer a new challenge and to change the story line of the game.

Later in the Overlord series lower level Overlords were made so players could run them in normal decks.  Typically these were just slightly more powerful Warlords.

There are 24 Overlords total. 17 Tournament Overlords, 2 promo Overlords and 5 playable Overlords.  I have 9 of the Tournament Overlords, 1 promo Overlord (Santa) and 1 playable Overlord (Winter, Eternal).  

But defeating on Overlord allowed you to advance in the challenge and fight a Dragonlord.

Dragonlord are even higher level and even more powerful then Overlords.  Dragonlords ruled the dragons and summoned them to their command.  The Dragonlord challenges were downright brutal and were nearly never defeated.  Defeating a Dragonlord was an amazing thing and offered you the last of the challenges.

There are 7 Dragonlords total.  I have 4 of the Dragonlords.

Beating a Dragonlord allowed a player to face a Medusan Lord.  Medusan Lords were simply extreme and nearly impossible to defeat.  They outright threw many of the rules away and made their own rules.  They have unbelievable powers and 

The Medusan Lord were what really progressed the story line.  When a Medusan Lord was defeated, it was killed forever and written out of the story.  Killing a Medusan Lord was a huge thing in the world of Warlord.

There were 42 Medusan Lords.  Amazingly 19 Medusan Lords have been killed.  7 have been retired as unbeatable.  16 remain alive and challengeable.  I have no Medusean Lords.

Side note - Later in the progression of the game a new challenge was offered called Daemon Lords.  These were on the same level as Dragonlords, but controlled and summoned Deamons rather than Dragons.  

There are only 2 Daemon Lords.  I have none.


-------------------------------------------------------------


So with the decks that I still have left and play with I created a randomizer to decide which deck to use for each battle.  it is dice based on the chart below - 

[u][i]Warlord - 1d20[/i][/u] - 
1 - Sav'rukk - Northrog Rogue Scout - Warlord centric a one-hit kill with items
2 - Ghed Mnettaur - Deverenian Paladin - Army centric spell boosting with Warlord item build

6 - Taoth - Nothrog Wizard Shaman - Warlord centric quick blitz with spells and items

RATING: 6.25
Only CCG I ever truly got into. Essentially, a D20 CCG. I don't think I would ever play this now, but enjoyed it back in the day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Used to play this competitively back in the day and it was fun, but even so, the importance of the dice rolling mechanic always meant that this was never going to be my highest rated game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I used to be hooked on this game but realized "collectible" is a four letter word and cost too much to keep up.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of my favorite designed CCGs, until power creep ruined it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played the starter a few times.  Nothing really grabbed me and hiring allies and equipping certain items and/or steeds are near impossible due to some of the outrageous level requirements they require.  Sometimes stuck with a lot of crappy cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
D20 based card game that was quite fun.  Just not into CCG anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] I thought this had some neat stuff going on in it. I'm not sure using the D&D style attack system was the best fit for a card game, but I really liked the ranked rows of cards as basis for the cost system.

I would have hung on to my cards if people were interested in playing it more.

excelente juego de cartas, lastima que dejaron de traerlas, ahi esta dejando polvo mi mazo enano clerigo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Got a free deck somewhere.  Never actually played with another person.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I have tons of extra cards and I sell singles. I also have a small list of needs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
More strategy with later expansions but still has a big "luck of the roll" factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cool game with lots of possibilities, but we couldn't get  the new sets in my city so we gave up playing around 2005 or so
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good condition.  Thousands of cards from a multitude of sets.

We were very impressed with the intro decks and looked forward to what the full game would be like - it was quite a letdown to discover that the very simple intro game really was everything there was to the game.

A failure of a CCG. Unoriginal theme, overly simplistic gameplay.

Not a bad game, but badly ripped off D & D so much that it wasn't even a question of it. Other than that, I would play it again if I got a chance to.

Dice rolling in this one can be a bit annoying.  All of the strategy of this game is done way before you even come to the table.

Unfortunately many times, it seems that you don't have many decisions to make while you are actually playing this game.  Most of your decisions are dictated by the cards in your hand.

Another problem exists in that typically in a game, you may only see 10 to 15 of the cards in your deck, which means that the game plays totally differently depending upon your card draws, thereby inhibiting some of the strategy that does exist when you actually do build a deck.

It's fun sometimes to see some of your combos work though.

I tried replacing the d20 with 2d10, but tweaks would have to happen to the low and the high armor classes, since the percentages change a little bit.

I think this game works VERY well as a sealed deck type of game, say with 30 to 40 card decks out of fresh battle packs and boosters, but the game loses ALOT of staying power once you start buying cards and building tournament legal 60 card decks.

The cards are colorful and crisp, and the symbols/graphics are clear and easy to use. The game itself allows for a bit of strategy and tons of tactics through the unit special powers, but that is also a small drawback, as new players will need to read every card to see what it does. The game is pretty interesting, but it's a battle of attrition with the goal to eliminate the other player's warlord. To do this, you pretty much have to blow through every character in your opponent's deck, so the listed play time of 10 minutes isn't even close. And the hour-plus playtime is really about the only downside here - I like the game quite a bit and wish the game could be played to conclusion a bit more quickly.

One of the best CCGs I've *ever* played. I've played quite a few: Magic, Battletech, Redemption, Vampire/Jyhad, Warhammer 40K, Star Wars, Young Jedi, Tomb Raider and many more. I've never found a game that so deeply tied your resource management into your resources. The "Rank and File" system is absolutely a joy to play with. Incredibly deep mechanics that emerge from simple rules. The only problems I've had with this game are power cards and finding someone to play with. For the first edition (Saga of the Storm edition), the power cards in the last couple of sets were rather unbalancing. I haven't played the Epic Edition extensively, but it looks very promising.

You have to admire the sheer brilliant [i]obviousness[/i] of this design. The first ads for it used the slogan, "The CCG you already know how to play."

An oldy, but a goody. The problem for me is that for those used to playing classic CCG's, with only card draw as the main element of luck, dice rolling dice just feels like one big game of chance. You can put all this stuff on your warlord, but if your opponent rolls a 20 then its curtains. The game can be fun if not taken too seriously. I still keep my old Good and Evil decks for nostalgia sake.

The rank and file system gives this game a miniatures feel.  Truly innovative and IMO the height of the Dave Williams ccg designs while he was with AEG.  My personal favorite ccg of all time.

A nice CCG. The D20 theme works very nicely. It really gives you a feeling of D&D action in a CCG. Nice artwork backs the game up very nicely.

fairly cool collectible card game using D&D rules to battle each other... fun, but I got out of CCG's...

Decent CCG.  Makes good use of card orientation.  Unfortunate dependence on dice in combat.

Ultimately, if I want some good CCG, I'll just stick with Magic.

A good game that manages to make dice rolls feel interesting and not just completely random. The pace is brisk, though the game goes on for maybe 15 to 20 minutes longer than I'd like.

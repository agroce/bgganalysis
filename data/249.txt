A great game with the right crowd.  Best with people who know each other well and enjoy the social experience of getting to make each others' lives miserable in a fun way.  Not for those who take losing/backstabbing/treachery personally at all times.

An enjoyable experience but was a bit long for my tastes. We sure did laugh a lot though, which was the most important thing by far. I think the game time could speed up, so perhaps I will give it another shot. I'm the Boss is still king as far as things things go, though.

I really enjoy Lifeboats. True, it is brutal and cruel. But mechanically, it is very smart and straight forward. This one only plays well with alot of people - I'd say at least 4 if not 5. More is better. There's some smart to where you jump and when you push boats ahead. It helps alot to understand how others are motivated. So another game I'd like to add to my collection because of the higher player count it supports.

EL JUEGO DE VOTAR A QUIEN BOTAS DEL BOTE! :D
La democracia funciona!? En situaciones límite no! xD Este juego lo demuestra. Negociación abierta, donde una vez se hunde el barco, al escapar los marineros y oficiales en varios botes salvavidas, hay que votar para todo! XD Ver que bote votas xD para que salga una fuga de agua, votar a quien botas del bote al agua, para que el bote no se hunda, votar que bote decides avanzar xD Puteo del grande y genial para más de 3 jugadores, contra más mejor hasta 6, muy muy divertido! Un juego que donde va, triunfa!

RATING: 7
A fun, amusing game.  Most actions (which boat springs a leak, which boat moves forward, who gets tossed overboard) are decided by voting amongst the players.  This tends to push towards a group-think approach, but also requires cooperation for success.  Plenty of opportunities for alliances & revenge.

Usually I don't go in for more competitive, negotiation games where you may have little control over your fate.  In this case, I'll make an exception.  There's a decent enough balance of control and group-think that it doesn't bother me all that much.

Or to put it another way, I rather enjoyed this one!  Give it a shot, but don't take it seriously (at all).

RATING: 5
This game was an experience game.  I've played it once, I've experienced the voting of people off, the swapping of boats.  It was fun while I played it, but I don't have any desire to play it again.  If someone else is excited to play it, I'd go along, but I've no desire to repeat it.

RATING: 5
Senseless voting fun that is great for the right group. Not to be taken too seriously. 

Everyone decides, nothing properly done as expected, randomness up to the fancy of each player. Anyone plays out of sync is as good as rolling dice and see what happens. 

A very average game that could be great or a total collapse in group gaming. A null shot.

Beautiful game...the box art just blows me away.  It's just so unique, and the quality of box itself also feels a step above other games.

Once you start playing the game, you find it's a pretty cool negotiation/diplomacy game.  Someone's gonna die...what can you do to make sure it's not you?

Plays much faster than Mall of Horror, which is a plus as well.

It's like a 45 minute version of Diplomacy, with voting instead of troop orders.  Hey! Look over there!  It's the HMS Happy Shining Friendship.  Let's sink it.

RATING: 8
Cracking game of pure-negotiation. Also probably the most horrible game ever. Drown your friends! Who your group are and what they enjoy is probably going to have a very big impact on whether you enjoy this game or not. I think it works much better with 5+ players and I can't recommend you play it with 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
WARNING! This rating based on one THREE-player game with one non-negotiator.
  This was not a positive experience.  
Do NOT...I repeat **NOT** try this at home.
That being said, I look forward to trying it again with 5 or, better, 6.

Replayed with 6 back-stabbing, throat-cutting so-and-sos.
As the early leader, I found myself spending the second half of the game    looking over my shoulder for sharks....better but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
the more I play this game the more I think it might be broken.  I feel like the absolute key is to play from behind.  Coming out ahead in points early always makes the leader a target and guarantees a loss for that player.

RATING: 6
I have the same opinion of this game as Bohnanza regarding the group your playing with. This is a good game with the right group but a bad one with the wrong group. The difference is though, this is more heavily dependent on the group you’re playing with, even more so than Bohnanza. Unlike Bohnanza you haven’t got anything to work with (like bean cards to offer) so it’s just pure negotiation. People are the engine of this game, not the game its self. 

Update: This wasn’t a bad game I just wanted an excuse to buy other games. This ended up being first on the chopping board so off it went, I sold it.

Deceptively simple to play. Everyone thought it was going to be pretty brainless the first time we played it.

This one will likely be played whenever we have a bunch of family over!

Not just nasty, but kind of pointless, as well.  You spend all that time picking your battles and negotiating and trying to pound on the leader, and in the end, if everyone's played roughly "correctly," it just boils down to that final turn.  Yuck.

Tentative rating after one play.  There's a lot here for a fast playing game.  Gotta love negotiation and not mind getting the knife in the back.  I like the German edition of this game more than the English language reprint due to the components.  If you enjoyt this game check out Mall of Horror which uses a similar mechanic, plus you get plastic zombies.  Much more appealing to me because of the theme.  

Plays best with more people (5-6) due to the negotiating nature of the game.

Pure negotiation game. What I'm finding is that pure negotiation games such as this really lack some luster when it comes to gaming. When I play a negotiation game, I need something else on the table - such as the strategizing in diplomacy where a bluff or sabre rattle can really mean something in the game.

It isn't like I'd turn a game of lifeboats down, but I'd probably wish we were playing something else.

The following impressions are from watching "Boardgames with Scott" review of the game.  It is a pure negotiation game, akin to Mafia, but you actually have something to discuss about as to why one should drown and shouldn't drown.  I am meh about this game since it is a pure negotiation game.  I just find these kind of games laborious.  Will definitely try it, but I doubt I'll ever purchase a copy.

A superb party game but only play with people who can accept betrayal since friendships will be tested in this game! Not for the faint-hearted! 

The only issue is that it can become rather repetitive and if the group is not the talkative type, this might have the potential to fall flat.

1 playing, with five.  Almost entertaining enough to justify, but falls just short.  Our game ended with more of a whimper, with the combination of number of boats, passengers, and leaks meaning the last two boats simply could not make it to shore short-circuiting the last two turns.  As a pure negotiation game this is probably a pretty good one, however, negotiation games are rapidly falling out (or have fallen out) of favor with me.

Since negotiation is non-binding the moment it's made, and you aren't negotiating for anything tangible (and you don't even know what the situation will look like in a turn or two) this is hardly a negotiation game.  More like Werewolf, I guess -- people suggest some potential outcomes for the votes and people try to make cases for or against them.

Our games were quick, and they were fun in an emotional way.  I like it OK but it's definitely a "sometimes" game.  For the negotiation aspect, I prefer Quo Vadis.

I guess I rated this one a little low because lots of people have a fear of playing it.  All of my games have been very low table talk, so feelings have not been hurt I don't think.  But of course with little table talk, this game doesn't really shine.  I would like to play this game more with good friends who aren't afraid of table talk and won't get their feelings hurt.  (Likewise with Diplomacy.)

Heard this was a brutal game of a cutthroat nature, it was.  It was not nearly as mean as we had anticipated.  We have a couple of angry gamers in our group, and we did not heed the warnings and tried it anyway.  We enjoyed it and had a good time.  Although there were definitely people playing favorites.  My daughters always chose to spare poor old dad, and relished at the thought of throwing their older brother overboard.  Super easy game that plays through quickly.

Great fun with one group.  Another group, they didn't like the backstabbing and negotiation.  So you have to know your group's tolerance.  I personally like negotiation games. 

In a 4 player game, its quite possible for it to play out as 2 vs 2 from the onset.  i.e. in one of our games, the negotiations led to a perma-team of 2 players, forcing the other 2 to side as well.  That was not as much fun due to negotiation being thrown out the window (the whole point of the game!)

Edit: traded away.  Cosmic Encounters is getting more play for the negotiation/backstabbing category

Fairly entertaining game with many elements of the prisoner's dilemma that has you foundering in decisions.

Quick, fun, and just plain BRUTAL!  A full compliment of 6 players is best - subtract probably 2 points from the rating for 5 players, 2 more for 4 and so on.

I don't like it as much the right way where only one man can jump from a boat - it's not brutal enough! =)

I really thought I'd like this one a lot, but after playing it I can't say there was really anything too great about this one.  It was fun at first, arguing about which boats to move and which boats should spring leaks, but once someone loses a few people they really don't care about the outcome of the game anymore.  Other than getting revenge on the people that killed you, there's not really much to do.  I probably would never suggest playing this one, and would probably even turn it down if I'm not in the right mood to play.

A little long, however, this game's rep as being cutthroat is a little exaggerated.  I mean, sure, a little, but no one's going to leave the table crying. Heck, we had played I'm the Boss right before, and that was far more cutthroat. It's hard to pinpoint what makes the game fun, I suspect it is the flow of watching people go overboard, rooting for your boat to make it to shore. There isn't much to the game, as it's just voting and the timing of your special cards to bypass the voting, and yet it all hangs together very well.

This has to be the most tense game I've ever played. The nice thing, though, is that even with all the tension and lobbying things keep moving at a good pace so the game never feels like it's dragging. Feels like a much more brutal and fun version of Mall of Horror. Good stuff, always gets our group yelling and laughing.

This game is total chaos.  The game is self balancing because no one will let anyone get ahead.  The only strategy is to hold onto your captains and hope that they are not matched by your opponent.

Not as much a game as a psychological exercise.  A game where people have in their mind who they want the winner to be and can actually make it happen without too much trouble at the end.  A quick version of Diplomacy.

Some pure nasty fun. Very chaotic and difficult to plan, at least in the beginning. The game lies more in the art of keeping men alive (whether through smart boat choices, negotiation, appearing as a non-threat, etc.) The screwage is high, but it must be played as a game since picking on certain people for personal reasons would ruin the 'game', but probably not the fun.

RATING: 4
A game where everything you do is negotiate, vote, screw someone over, repeat. Lots of table talk and if you can fly under the radar or make side agreements with someone next to you, you will stand the best chance at winning. With that said because the game is all about negotiation it is not one that appeals to me since there is very little I can do to benefit myself without coercing some of the others around the table. It also is entirely far too long of a game for negotiating every few minutes.

After one play, this felt fun but a little light on the negotiation. Maybe with more plays with people who know what they are doing, it'll pick up. But as just a fun, screw-you game, it was okay. This and Intrigue felt similar in that it probably takes experience to really appreciate the game. Not only do you need experience to make decent offers to other players, you need a counterparty that understands what you are talking about. Without experience it is a bit of free-for-all. Not totally a bad thing, but not ideal.

1 play. Kind of a euro-party game.  Nice bits. For a party game, it's good, but not something I'd ever choose, so that makes it a 4 on the BGG scale, which doesn't mean it's a poorly design game, of course.  It's clearly well designed, but doesn't grab me.

I know I will never ever ever win this game, but I love crafting uncomforatble situations on the votes.  "Oh, player A and B have an alliance?  Lets get all thier pawns in the same boat and make them throw each other to the sharks."

With the right crowd, this is an amazing game of group think and shifting alliances, but you need some thick skinned gamers that are willing to play dirty to really make it shine.  I can still remember some amazing double crosses in previous games - which I consider high praise.

This is a great game for negotiation and back-stabbing. But like most games in that vein, it can be conducive to bickering and unpleasant feelings.  Some game groups have a lot of fun with that opportunity, but other times players can take it badly. You may want to judge your group carefully before playing. I don't recommend it as a family game.

I'd be happy to play again, but this isn't a game that I feel is missing in my collection.

For those unfamiliar with this it's sometimes referred to as the lifeboat game. This is primarily a negotiation game in the same vein as Intrige and Diplomacy. So your milage will vary based on your feelings about such games. I personally have started to lean away from these games. This one is simpler than diplomacy, but there is some room for strategy unlike intrigue which is pure mayhem.

1 play rigged up to handle 7 players using a home made version and some pieces from an original. Probably a game where the group makes the game... our group changed from friendly to the point of choosing to put leaks in boats where noone would die and letting two boats easily make shore to so cut throat that we almost didn't get any other boat safely home (one more made it and one turn later it would have been gone too).

Some in the group didn't care for it. I tried to warn people that it's NOT a strategy game. Does everything really have to be a strategy game?   There%u2019s a clever balance between having enough control over a single boat, and not being too big of a target; and between using your captains early verses late. But at the end of the day, how can you not have fun voting on which boat springs a leak, who has to jump out, and which gets to move, with Chinese fire drills to top it all off? Sold it after 1 play. I would've played again, but my group has too many games that are preferred over this.

As it's a pure negotiation game, the players will determine whether the game is rollicking, acrimonious, or tepid.  It's a good idea to have your sailors on boats with lots of other players (to be part of the temporary "coalitions", and definitely avoid any boats that are close to sinking (everyone likes to watch a boat go down!).  It's easier to exert control at the end game, when several of the boats have already sunk or made it to shore.

Played with my gaming group and it was a fabulous good time.  I wouldn't want to play this one all the time, but its good to pull out on occasion.

Think this game would be even more fun by adding some secret objective cards.  As it stands, it is a war of personalities.

Production: Wonderful wooden boats, pawns, and leaks.  The spin wheels are clever, though they move around a bit on their own.  I would prefer if the board didn't stagger the boat spaces, making boats in some columns look closer to the islands than those in other columns.  Play: The play is simple and enjoyable, with ever changing allegiences and logic.  Can be difficult if players with differing degrees of competition are playing together.  (2+1+3) (2 plays)

RATING: 8.7
Seems like the perfect game of diplomacy and table-talk, with no other complications to distract from that core.

The rules are simple - vote to spring a leak (voting to eject a seaman if the holes are all full or sinking the ship if there are now more leaks than seamen); vote to move a boat; move seamen between boats. Easily understood after a single round - of which there were around 15.

I would enjoy playing this again anytime with anyone. I'm surprised it doesn't support more folk - it seems like it could be easily expanded - whilst with only 3 or 4 I imagine it'd lose some of the political maneouvering: trying to be in popular boats, ensuring you have a strong but not-too-strong presence etc.

Like Brass, I already have a strategy I'm eager to implement for my next game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun game of negotiation, alliance making, and betrayal.  More than anything else, it is a game of misdirection.  Even so there is quite a bit of game involved in making sure it is not in people's best interest to sink your boats.  There are definite rewards for thinking a few turns ahead, and guessing what people will do.

RATING: 5
Possibly one of the most vicious games I've played. The mechanics actually work well overall although I dislike that a player who is completely out of the game (no more pawns and is not leading in points) still has decisions to make... their only role at that point is kingmaker which is never fun.

It felt like there's no real strategy as the situation changes so much from turn to turn and the only real measure of how well someone is doing is by current pawns on the island as nothing else is guaranteed.  This hurts the negotiation as there's very little else to use as negotiating power.

This game is entirely too long for what it is. A huge problem with this game is that you can be mathematically eliminated from being a possible winner, and yet you still have to sit there for another hour and a half, aka it basically has player elimination without actually allowing the player to leave (lest the whole game has to stop and everyone gets in a sour mood).

It has a reputation of being a mean game that no one will want to play as long as you have a game of it in your memory, but that's weird because the meanness is artificially forced into it by the way the mechanics work, and its probably more the miserable time of having to stick around when you've lost that keeps people away from playing it again more than it is that relationships get tested.

I still like it, but the last few times I've played, the game seems to have dragged on a little.

[September 2014 - 7.5]
For a relatively older game in the resurgent board game world, this is a good one. Probably more than any other game -- even perhaps over The Resistance -- it creates the most debate and arguing among the group. Fun game to bring to the bar.  That being said, it's heavy on leader-bashing without the balance of say, King of Tokyo in that respect. So many times, it's the player hanging in the back that ends up winning, and for that reason, there's little to be gained for attacking ... but then, what fun is the game? I think I enjoy the attacking and trash-talking more than trying to win. The action of switching boats is brilliant because alliances rarely survive -- who's going to betray the other first? It's good fun.

Can be quite a riot and full of hilarious moments. Certainly would seem to require 6, maybe 5 people to be at its best.  We voted quickly rather than spending a lot of time in negotiations, so maybe that makes it a little arbitrary.   Not a game that would get played often, but with the right crowd this is a home run.   It's also a great example of how games don't need to be taken too seriously to be a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
While a pure-negotiation style of game rarely works out in practice, Lifeboats add some extra elements that make it highly playable. Different points of negotiation (which boat moves? which boat springs a leak?) keep the discussion fresh. Captain cards allow for unexpected twists, thus avoiding 'foregone outcomes.'

However, as with all pure-negotiation, arguments breaking out over the table can bring the game to a halt or cause feelings of ill will. I've had great games and I've had horrible games - you've got to make sure you're playing with a positive group who don't take games personally.

I really have to be in the right mood with this one.  I feel like to win a game like this, you have to ultimately stab people in the back, which takes some of the fun away for me.  If played with the right group I think it could be a lot of fun, but assembling just the right group could be a chore.  Another down side is that with all of the negotiation the game can have wildly varying play times.

I would recommend playing with the maximun number of players.  Tried it with 4 and it didn't work out so well with the negotiations, as the boats were mostly segregated down to just two colors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tried it on some causal gamers. what a blast! The "trump" cards in the game make every vote exciting, and without them you'd never get anywhere. Much better than mall of horror because you have more control over what rooms/boats everyone will be in. (and it's shorter, and the rules are shorter, etc...) I don't rate it a 10 because I suspect this is a "once in a while" game. 
As a side note 3 players was fun, a full table just took forever.

Well themed negotiation game. Don't get ahead too early, you probably won't end the game in first place. 

I'm not totally allergic to negotiation and nasty games, but for me this game is just a little too long and a little too nasty. It's not a bad game by any stretch. It is designed well, it has a nice presentation, and the theme is fitting. If those attributes intrigue you, give this game a shot.

RATING: 6
In this game you try to move life boats with pawns representing survivors of a shipwreck to an islands.  Along the way the boats spring leaks so that some pawns must be tossed overboard.  The game consists of rounds of secret voting to determine which boat leaks, who on that boat is tossed over, and which boat moves forward.

Plays fairly quick and rules are easy to learn and teach.  Kinda fun and could be quite  fun with the right group, but not my thing really, and not something I'd like to play on a regular basis.  Too much guessing what others will do.

Interesting game that's virtually all negotiation (although it seems quite cutthroat?).  See the video review here: http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=64
I enjoy negotiation games, and this one is not quite as good as Santiago, but perhaps more accessible for non-gamers.  See my [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/327734]session report here[/url].

Status: Owned only as long as I had it between purchasing and giving it as a farewell gift to a friend.

I got this for Christmas 2006 from my sister Anke. I think our boardgame group is going to like it, they're mostly competitive, but not to a degree where they'll sulk if someone goes after them, which I think is required for this game.

RATING: 6
Conceptually I love the idea of this game and while I have no problems with it, it feels too mechanical and the end got very predictable.

The problem is my group are not emotional gamers; we don't bring all our baggage to the table and unload on each other.  We will say it to each other's faces so there is no pent up animosity towards each other.

I'm hoping City of Horror will give me what I am after with a bit more randomness and more motivating players to deviate from each other.

2004? first play

May 2008 - This game doesn't really work unless you have 5-6 players. And it helps if you don't try and win, because this game is next to impossible to plan to win. But man, is it a funny game to play. The new version is great except for the cards which have a very thin color border which is not all that easy to see. (Why didn't they make the colors more visible?)

June 2014 - My opinion of this is EXACTLY what I put down four years ago.

4th play: 7. Aug/14, 6p - And, again, same comment exactly.

RATING: 9
Deliciously revengeful.  Beautiful pieces, quality game.  Jumping out of the lifeboats doesn't make sense, but certainly adds an important element to the game.  A good raucous game.  I think in our gaming group this one is the most social game we play, and it is tops for laughs too.

A simulateneous revealed voting game. Lots of fun. some clunky unthematic game events each turn, and the board could have been better designed to show what those turn elements were. The end game felt odd, but that could have been just becasue it was my first play. I will happily play again.

Good enjoyable game (if a little long and possible flat at the end - - provided the nasty is kept at the fun level, a good solid game rating of 7 (18/2/12). UPDATE: If you don't like being involved in nasty negotiation games, keep away. But, It's a great design and theme. How something so simple can result is complex and cruel is fascinating. The boat jump phase is just the right amount of chaos but doesn't result in extended AP. Recent game had a very exciting finish and did not drag. Rating increase to 8, but qualified in that I would only play once every 6 months (4/8/13). UPDATE: 3SF (Rating 8.347, Dec 16)

RATING: 7.5
A fun little negotiating game where the object is to get as many of your crewmen as possible to the best island possible.  Each players vote on the following activities:  which boat will spring a leak, which sailor will be tossed overboard in the boat that sprung a leak, and which boat will advance towards the islands and safety.  After the voting is finished each player must remove one of their crewmen from one of the boats and put it in a different boat.  It is a bit of a cut-throat game but quite fun.

Opinion: this is those kind of games that you need the appropriate group. You can play it seriously, but the backstabbing could be the devil for you. Take it as a party/ light game where you have to go into the game, put yourself into the rol of something in that situation and you will have lot of fun (no matter if you talk or not during the game, if you fulfill this premise, you will have fun)

This is a very mean spirited game with high screw factor. Only play with people who can take all those unholy alliances. "The Captain Cards" should have been ranked 1-3 to allow tie breaking. As out of the box with more than 4 players chances are too high that you play a captain card at the same time with another (and losing your influence). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good humored cutthroat game. 

Even if there is some strategy and calculation to do, the heart of the game is negotiation. In this sense I like it greatly, but for some mechanics, say the people who have to swim from one boat to the next it may feel constrained. 

With all games of this nature, one should not concentrate on one player lest he will retaliate in kind. 

That said, the game is short enough to make the experience of backstabbing very enjoyable!

A game of negotiation, alliances, and voting, Lifeboats does this well enough keeping the game "above the table." The captain cards add a nice touch of guessing when to play to veto any current vote. On the downside, there is not much game, only negotiation and discussion. With this, the games runs a bit longer than I would like. The mechanics and discussions are good, however.

When it comes to negotiation games, Lifeboats is a favoured classic for me because it has everything on the table and everyone can see the situation everyone else is bargaining from.  No randomness or hidden agendas whatsoever.

The funny and colorful artwork in Z-Man edition suits the game very well. It is what I would call a "Euro party game". It's all about boring, pointless negotiations that precede voting, tempered with a bit of outguessing and backstabbing. Indeed, I think it's a negotiation game that might be better without any negotiations. Really not to my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
rating after one game - Chaotic Screwfest that is good filler with the right crowd.  Players place pawns on lifeboats and then game progresses by alternately having players simultaneously/secretly vote to select one boat to move forward toward the island and vote to have one boat spring a leak.  If springing a leak (placing a blue disk in one of the six seats on the boat) means that a pawn has to be removed to make room for the leak, players with pawns on that boat vote to decide who to kick off the boat.

When I saw 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' I knew I just had to have it.  Then when I saw Lifeboats was coming out, I said 'when that comes out I'm getting that'.  Well during xmas time I try not to buy many games (give my wife a chance).   One of my gaming buddes was very proud that he picked one up in a trade and had beaten me to it.  So, we threw it onto the table all excited.  The box even smelled new.  But, I must say what a disappointment.  I'm not normally one to complain about gang up in the leader, but the leader was soooo clear cut and sooooo easy to take out (ok after captains), that it was the last leader that won (and last person not to be leader).  And it toook for ever to end the game.  The first 2/3rds was fun, but then it was just, 'will this end' it's now the same thing over and over.

More of an experience than a game, but not that bad.  Probably better the more drunk you are.  Thats usually a bad sign for a game but not lifeboats.  There were a few turns were serious analysis of what was going on could have been useful and the strategy of the game was apparent, but I was having more fun just enjoying the ride so I can't really comment on the decisions.

UPDATE:  Played a second time.  The basic voting mechanic, combined with good tabletalk, makes for a pretty fun experience even though overall the game itself is a mess.  The last couple of rounds practically finish themselves and the design essentially guarantees some kingmaking will occur in the late game.  When you have the tiebreaker, you have no chance of winning, and you are forced to break a tie between two other players that will determine the result of the game, thats a horrible feeling, and a terrible design.

It's all about the back-stabbing in this one.  It would not be good to play with anyone too sensitive or competitive.  To keep alive while hopping in and out of the sinking boats, you've got to use your powers of persuasion and time your push for the lead just right.  The more, the merrier.

Great game the first time I played with 3 ppl, everyone going for themself. But when I played with 5 ppl, 3 ppl formed a team against us 2, basically taking time to tell each other what move to take and thus dictating the game. So we knew we had no chance of winning already. I was willing to play to the end, but they got bored halfway through knowing their team would win even though its not a team game.

An aggressive negotiation game that is very fun to play (and I don't generally like negotiation games).  The backstabbing that takes place is very upfront and expected, fast, not immediately fatal (generally), and can be ignored by someone who just plays a card to take an action.  Lots of laughing and tactics to this.  Akin to Survive Sinking of Atlantis.

Down graded my evaluation from an 8 to a 6.  Ran into a situation where two players teamed up with each other from the very start and targeted everyone else.  Effectively broke the game (they did this twice), taking it from a fun game to one where you just feel ganged up on every second of play.  I don't want to play this for quite some time, and I might even trade it away because of them.

The games actually seems to foster co-operative work, however in Truth what occurs is the opposite.  You have to make an alliance with someone else to move forward in the game, but since there are 5 other players, your alliance with one of them really results in backstabbing the other 4.  Nice wooden bits.  It plays an hour or so, but does not seem long as there are really only three spaces to move and you can easily see progress being made.

Pure negotiation/screwage/backstabbing game, an absolute blast if you can find a group that enjoys that kind of thing. Best with 6 players (if you have 5 players and want a similar level of screwage, play Intrige).

Love the wooden pieces for this game. I'm wanting to play this more but am always reluctant to bring it to the table. The first time I played it, my sister got extremely upset because everyone was always voting her off the boats. We weren't doing it on purpose but it got to her. She got up and left in the middle of the game and said she'd never play the game again. And we haven't yet. Maybe some day.

RATING: 7
A fun, every person for themselves kind of game.  When the rules tell you that no deals are binding until you play a card, you just know it can be fun with the right group.  

For me, the perfect time to play this one is at the end of the night, after your main game.  I've seen some people become pissed at everyone because they were backstabbed, and I've seen others team up to eliminate that annoying third wheel.

I have also just enjoyed "DM-ing" the game simply to see the underhanded deals people were trying to make with each other.  Some were using counting systems so they could be sneaky with their voting, girlfriends threatening their boyfriends of what what happens if they didn't vote a certain way, and that moment when everyone screws their "teammates".

This is a very well designed game that suffers from its innately cut-throat nature. Most people can't handle having their boats and sailors sunk in a continual barrage of negative group voting. It an interesting social experiment but this game probably won't see much play because of this issue. It also runs a bit long ...Sorry it deserves better.

After 1 play.

Negotiation game which can deliver quite deal of fun (but you need a proper group :-) ).
Nonetheless I will not buy it - it's just sheer fun and this creates (naturally) accidental results.  For party games I prefer other titles :-) [anyway it's worth playing from time to time]

This is pretty much pure negotiation, but the way that the endgame works really undermines the rest of the game.  I'd rather play other negotiation games.

EDIT:  Upping to 6.  This can be a fun game with the right group and the right mood.  Since far too often your fate can really be out of your hands, you have to have a pretty easy-going group in order to enjoy it.

I've played both this game and Mall of Horror. While at heart they're the same game and I would expect Mall of Horror to be better because of the theme, but it's not! This version is much better and much more fun somehow.  I truly don't understand why, maybe it was the different people. But I'd take this version any day. However, DO NOT start a game of this up at 4am. Wow, talk about nasty!

Very good game for what it is, needs to be played with the right people.  Simple but deep mechanics, with the boat switching at the end of each turn being key.  Need 5 to make it work at all, I think, 6 is better.  A good "real" version of Survivor.

Played with 6, and this is a great negotiation game.  A bit of threatening, a bit of working together, a bit of trying to sway people is a good thing in my mind.  Th game took 1.5 hours, but everyone felt as though it played fast due to how each turn is broken up, and one is usually an active participant at most times.  Rules are much simpler then they seem when you read them the first time.

Note, there was a king-maker situation, but no one complained about it as it seemed in line with how the game is played.

Ok game would play again if asked just not one I will suggest.  Seems like the last boat on the board is useless to play to the end, at least in our game it seemed that way.  Also, the actions to be done each round are easy to get confused on which phase is which and when it is played basically because of the speed of the rounds.  Again, at least in our game it seemed that way.

The best backstabbing/negociation game with Intrige IMO. Rette Sich is more of the political kind (you have to vote and make other players vote against each other), as Intrige is more of the business kind (you screw your buddies with contracts). Of course, everybody should be aware not to take this game seriously, otherwise you could lose friends and family.

This rating is based on a game with 6 players who can all get into the spirit and not take it too seriously. But if even one player isn't into it, the score would suffer dramatically. This is an extremely interactive game and virtually everything is decided by voting. If a player can't handle being on the short end of votes, they should not attempt this game! I thought my wife wouldn't take to it, but she gets in the right frame of mind and we have fun.

One of the worst negotiation games I have played. You're not negotiating for anything tangible so what the hell is the point?

I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but it's still a pretty fun game.  I like the negotiation element, though it seems much less mean-spirited than I anticipated.  Since it is much easier to see who will win, the decisions of who to vote for is usually much more obvious and lead to an easier consensus.  In a game like Intrigue, it is much more difficult to track who is in the lead, since money is hidden.  Our first game of Lifeboats played relatively quickly - I would never play this if I thought it was going to last longer than an hour.  Especially since some players can be eliminated (or their chances of winning can be eliminated), forcing them into a kingmaking situation.

Update: I've played this a few more times, mainly at school with students.  Each time the kingmaking problem has bothered me more.  Even with non-gamer students, it is easy to calculate who is winning, and only judicious use of the captain cards will bring the game to an end.  Traded away.

It's like Survivor: the board game. Actually, there probably is such a game already. So let's say it's Survivor at Sea: the Survivor-style board game that's actually good.

Because most of Lifeboats IS the meta-game and because it involves making--and breaking--deals, this game isn't everyone's cup of tea. But if you've a group that enjoy voting leaks into lifeboats, this game fits the bill. It plays many players at once without slowing down and its vibrant, colorful board and pieces make the theme really pop out.

Players vote on which boats will advance towards land and which passengers will be thrown overboard. 

The Good: Plays fairly quickly - I would say about 45 min. There is some persuasion. Nice components.

The Bad: Very limited on what you can offer other players. The same voting going on over and over.

The Ugly: This is definitely a back-stabbing game.

I played this once after a guy explained the rules while quickly skimming the rulebook, but we missed the whole notion that you actually *talk* about who should get voted out.  All we did is think and then vote, so the votes were random and I didn't get the game at all.  Later I discovered that it's supposed to be a "negotiation" game!  Boo. Now I need to try it again sometime.

RATING: 4
The main problem of this game: The voting system does not have any meaning to the players, since usually only one boat will be safe (occasionaly two boats, but still not very important).

So, if three or four players become allies, this game sucks. (i.e. This game has a very big "king-maker" problem.)

One the few mid-weight 6 player games out there.  Playtime is reasonable (under 2 hours) for a 6 player game, but it can drag.
The amount of negotiation done by your group will really determine how long this takes to play.  In the games I've played, we have not had long drawn out negotiations.  The game usually is people just saying what they plan to vote and then everyone tries to build a consensus or figure out who is bluffing.
I just barely prefer Lifeboats over I'm the Boss for a negotiation game.

Remember, what happens in Life Boats stays in Life Boats! 

This game is all about negotiation, backstabbing, and ganging up on each other to decide who to pitch overboard. It’s definitely not for everyone. If you’ve got the right group in the right mood it can be amusing, just make sure not to play with anyone whose feelings are likely to be hurt by being manipulated and lied to by their friends...

There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon. However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite. To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one. As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn. If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!

Feels like a party/experience strategy game.  This "Lifeboat" game is fabulous fun with timing mechanisms for screw-your-neighbor, especially if groups know each other very well.  Game is highly prone to group think and perception and that's the heart of the fun.  I see it essentially as "Survivor (the reality show) as a German boardgame" and serves as a good diplomacy party game.

Seemed a bit lifeless with only 4 people.  This game really requires people to be in the right mood to be very nasty...:-)  Probably best with 6 players to get more voting in on the action.  With the right crowd, this game is very enjoyable and is an 8; with the wrong crowd, this game falls over like a lead balloon.  Fortunately, the crowd has been in the right frame of mind most of the time although I wouldn't mind a bit less of the "gang up on Larry and take him out" mentality....:-)

This is a very fun negotiation game.  It is quite simple in terms of mechanics which really puts the table talk into the foreground.  It's a bit more streamlined than Mall of Horror (and lacks the theme of that game which is a plus for me). It seems to loose a little tension in the endgame which keeps it from becoming a "must buy" for me.

I slightly prefer the gameplay of Lifeboats, which is more strategic and less random.  However, the end of Lifeboats often comes down to a king making vote and can be either really tense or somewhat anticlimactic.

"Lifeboats: Where the meta-game is the game."

I haven't played many negotiation games, but this one strikes me as a very good one. Each turn is played over 3 rounds, which gives a sense of order to the chaos. The start player breaks ties and the captain is trump, which allows for some interesting double-guessing.

My only complaint with the Z-man edition is the components. The officers look too similar to the deckhands. Further, some of the colors on the cards are difficult to tell apart. Overall, these are minor.

You sure have to be in the right group and mood to play this game. It can be a very good opener as well, though - people I played with rarely bash someone collectively and we have lots of fun. I suggest playing with "The Stick Variant" as found in "Rette sich wer kann". It's a sad thing that the rules need MANY clarifications even though they are that simple - they should be fixed in a probable next edition.

A highly-entertaining negotiation and blind voting game.  I can see that the mileage might vary from game group to game group.  Lots of fun banter is nearly inevitable from the theme and nature of the game, though.  I don't ordinarily enjoy pure negotiation/diplomacy games, but it is possible to enjoy playing this without too much deal-making and/or backstabbing.  I think it is a much more approachable game than say Diplomacy by non-gamers.

RATING: N/A
Apparently this is a redevlopment of Mall of Horror.

This plays better with 5 or 6.

Component-wise this game is a MUST HAVE. But given the inherent screwage and lying that needs to be done to win, there doesn't seem to be any way this would fly with students or family. Plus it sends a terrible message to those to whom we preach how boardgames are designed to bring people closer together. THAT BEING SAID, Scott Nicholson's review suggests that there need NOT be ANY lying. You ARE making alliances and breaking alliances, BUT you do NOT have to be a liar or a cheater or a breaker of promises. You CAN actually play nicely and let who's winning be the person to decide who to screw. As well, you DO need some HUMOR if you're going to be voting a spouse or girlfriend off the boat (EX: I love you sweetie, but I'm going to have to toss you). And, if you could execute that decision without ANY malice or anger, then you could very well keep the game at a light feeling level.

QUOTES FROM ONE REVIEW (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/445669/a-review-a-week-9-you-need-the-right-group-of-peop):
"As I said before, this game is all negotiation - no dice, no cards, no worker placement, nothing. You proceed throught the turns of the game, asking people if they will do what you ask, promising them whatever you can think of to convince them to agree with you, but ultimately, nothing you agree to is binding in any way. This opens the doors to backstabbing, treachery, and feeding your opponents giant bowls of spite."
"Now why did I tell you that story? Because I wanted to show you the inherent problem a game like this represents. Lots of games have a screwage factor built into the mechanics. Lots of games give you the ability to screw your friends over, even if it isn't necessary to the game. Lifeboats is a game that, if you want to win, you have to screw at least one other person at one point or another, all the while covering your own ass from the treachery of your opponents."

This is pure evil packaged in a box that looks like a childrens game. For me it's a kind of ersatz-Diplomacy. Combines bluff, negotiation and voting in an easy elegant system. As a friend of mine said: "A truely democratic game".

The Lifeboat Game,' this pure negotiation game puts a different spin on the typical ocean catastrophe. There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon. However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite. To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.

RATING: 9.5
Great interactive game if everyone is a live wire. Absolutely dreadful if someone is either a complete pacifist or keeps playing in favor of someone. Temporary alliances, backstabbing and lying are encouraged in the rules and also have my personal endorsement to make the game more interesting.

Cruelly fun negotiation game that went well with a few glasses of wine first. Wouldn't play it often, but with the right group, it can be a blast. Or turn spouses on each other. (My wife sat it out.) Cool that it can (and did) play 6 without bogging down.

Democrazy on boats. You move. You leak. You swim. 

Interesting voting mechanics (similar to Democrazy) 

The goal is to move boats to the safety of desert islands. 

It is a bit like Survive! (very loosely) Similar themes. I like the monsters, whales and components of Survive! better. 

The game is a little dry. With a lively group in the afternoon this game could be a ball. With a group on the tail end of a long game session this is not your best bet.

This game is fun when you've got a group of friends that have no qualms about bald-faced lying and back-stabbing and who also enjoy practicing a little diplomacy. This game is all about persuading other players to vote with you to bump off other players and/or taking you with them to victory as you scheme to move your leaky, little, sailor-filled lifeboats to shore where you score points. Fun game with the right crowd.

RATING: 6
Interesting and different, but not very compelling.  I think the game could benefit from an additional mechanism that would force people to make (and break) alliances.  The game seemed to divide players into two camps:  those who were in it to win at all costs and those who preferred to vote so that the most people would benefit.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not as much fun as it used to be.  Gets monotonous and there's a predictable "attack the early leader" format that every game seems to follow -- regardless of the group.

Still, usually a hit for those playing it for the first time (as long as they're not big ol' crybabies).

This game can be really nasty or really fun or both depending on the crowd.  The end of game scoring tie breaker often comes into effect so getting your boat home safely can be decisive.

Cut Throat game.  Period.  Everything can be negociate.  With the right crowd, it's downright nasty.  I'm lucky to have such a nice crowd.  It's not a game that will see a LOT of play, but once in a while, it can be a good change of pace.  That's a keeper for sure.

Category: Light Strategy - fun with right group of players that don't take voting personally and willing to lie and betray other players to win. However, plays a little longer than it should with the same mechanic. Also, who still has a chance to win and who doesn't becomes obvious towards mid game and is no longer fun for players that don't have a chance.

It's HARD to form a long-term strategy in this game. There is tons of chaos, and the alliance structures shift at the end of almost every turn because everyone jumps out a boat and swims to a new boat.

The fun-factor is high - it has some of the tension of other typical negotiation games, but somehow feels lighter, and so not quite as nasty and backstabby. A great purchase.

Lifeboats is a gorgeous looking game. The board is beautiful, the pawns are cool, and the chunky wooden boats are beautifully overproduced.

Players take on the role of sailors on boats trying to get to islands. However, boats spring leaks and sailors (by a vote) must be thrown overboard. Once boats reach islands, VPs are awarded per sailor. Played this once with 5 players and it seemed quite random. The theme is probably good for one or two laughs, but none of us had the desire to play again.

Truly a neat game.  PErfectly diplomatic, perfectly vicious.  Very simple as it consists of a series of votes on who gets tossed overboard, who moves forward, and who gets eaten by the sharks.  Definately would sell to the 'I'm the boss' crowd. German version has excellent production quality.  Especially like the glueing the pieces together and the wooden bits.

ehhhhh, this game is getting old fast for me.

It took a bit to warm up to it, but a 6 player game went very smoothly after initial rounds. Or perhaps I should say it got excalatingly more vicious as rounds went on. I think this is probably best with full complement of 6 players.

I have played this twice.  I won the first time, but that may have been more due to the other players' ganging up on one person, rather than a result of anything I did.  The second game, I just tried to stay on as many boats as possible and I saved my captain cards almost to the end before using them.  I wish the two kinds of pawn were more different, since I sometimes had trouble distinguishing them from across the table.

RATING: 6
A parte i barconi in legno, a prima vista Lifeboats non fa gridare al miracolo. Ma la prima impressione è sbagliata. Regole semplicissime ma diaboliche lo rendono un party game spassosissimo (che va ben oltre le 1-2 ore indicate nella confezione). Si gioca di testa e di pancia, si gioca d'opportunità e si fa metagioco, si dice ma non si promette. Molto divertente. Occhio! Il gioco potrebbe essere rallentato dai giocatori "pensatori". Inoltre, il pesante utilizzo di colori fa sì che giocatori daltonici necessitino l'insegnante di sostegno.

Fun light negotiation game with nice wooden components. But it seems, that it´s more of a novelty game where replay value is quite low.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoyed the negotiation, bluffing, and backstabbing elements of this game.  For a while it was the backstabbing game I was looking for.

The game seems a little repetitive and its replay value depends on new players at the table.  Also like most of these negotiation/backstabbing games, the game shines or fails based on who's playing.  (My group doesn't have good players for that.)  Also the man overboard rules/functions seem odd.

RATING: 5
Jury is still out on this one. So much voting takes too much time for what it is, but the switching boats mechanic at the end of each round is very strategic. There is a nice amount of chaos (meaning it is hard enough to predict what is going to happen) and yet there are no dice so it is not luck driven.

It is a very interesting idea for a game and the boats are great quality. The only thing holding my rating back is the voting. Too many times every voted for a different boat and the start player just breaks the tie. It would almost be easier if the start player just picked from the beginning. Even just randomly picking a card blind might work. It would be faster, but the degree of chaos would be about the same.

This is a vote your best friend out of the boat game and watch him drown....he he. I really like these types of games, even though I know its not everyones cup of tea. However, I don't play it as often, since one of the other game group members has Mall of Horror and who would not rather play with zombies.

RATING: N/A
German edition of 'Lifeboats'. Nice chunky wooden components, and this has the look of a colourful children's game, but this is essentially a 'Diplomacy' variant because it involves negotiation and entreaties to secure the votes necessary to avoid being cast overboard as the lifeboats sink.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
(10+ plays)

Who can play?  Party game for 4-6 players.

Pure negotiation game of mercilessly drowning your opponents.  A bit like a reality TV show where you vote off your opponents.  I seldom win this game because I'm known to be an untrustworthy bastard - in games.  This is absolutely a permanent keeper.

RATING: 7
Lots of yelling in this one.  There are some bitter fights from time to time, but mostly this game is full of laughter.  Nowadays I prefer Mall of Horror, but if being eaten by zombies is too morbid for you, you can just chuck your friends out of the lifeboat with Rette Sich Wer Kann.

supercool game of just pre-Catan vintage.  lots of player interaction, rather than mathy calculation of probabilities and set values, etc.  this makes it very welcome on the table with the right group -- usually couples.  were it not so thoughtful, i'd dub it a party game.

Sadly, played after Cash'n'guns, (another rare 6 player game) and Rette being 12 years older, it shows its age. Both games are simultaneous voting at it's core, but C&G is more dramatically fun. The negotiation element is handled differently in each design, but Rette is ponderous and calculative in feel, whereby C&G is more bluffing and less likely to involve group bashing. So Rette is no longer a Desert Island game, and I don't miss throwing it overboard years ago.

RATING: 6
A negotiation game where all actions are taken by consensus with overrides by the captain's cards. High level of screwage, with a balance between having control over a boat and sharing the results. When to use your captain's cards and when to score.
Was too cutesy and just didn't seem to capture the angst of being on a sinking boat. Prefer Mall of Horror for similar voting mechanic.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As all decisions made in the game are based on negotiation and (hidden) voting there's a lot of 'screw your opponent' action going on. Not to be played with people that can not lose or easily feel personally offended (which applies to all games but especially to this one). Sometimes the tension can drop in the end game when most/all but one ship(s) already arrived at the islands...

This is a good, straightforward negotiation game, with ample opportunities for screwage.  Inevitably, someone gets mad at one other particular player and makes it their mission to foil that player, rather than to score points for themselves.  The key is staying out of those conflicts.  A good game, but not for everyone.

Can feel random and chaotic at first, but by game's end there is a group think involved.  Initial negotiations are likely to call for picking on certain colours.  But if players aren't too careful, the quiet ones can sneak in for the win.  Really needs to be played with a large number of players.

A pure negotiating game that seems to play quickly.

So, we played this one. It wasn't short (took about 2-3 hours for the first play). I felt that the game didn't go over well with everyone who played it, but I was surprised to say that they liked it in the end. Weird.

After a lot of play, I just don't understand how it can take less than 2-3 hours, unless we've grossly misunderstood the rules. It now has a rating, and will likely stay at that.

The primary reason for the rating is that it's fun for 2 hours, but it begins to drag if it takes longer than that. It's extremely important to manage time in this, but somehow still allow enough time for negotiation to remain interesting.

Uninspired. Vote for leak, vote for drowning, vote for moving, musical chairs, rinse-repeat many times. I get bored by games without some sort of development.

Have a mostly hate relationship with how negotiation is implemented, and in this case, having incentives be so temporary and such a color-cluster doesn't really give any reason to make deals.

Captain cards are the only inspiration here, helping throw a wrench in every vote so it's not always deterministic.

Remind everyone that 'it's just a game' before you start.

This game revolves around people trying to get boats with their sailors to islands at the end of the board. Votes are done in secret and determine which boats starts leaking, which one moves and which (if any) player's sailors drown.

With the right group of people prepared to bargain and deal, this can be a superb game of negotiation and backstabbing. 

Play with safe people and it will fall flat. Runs slightly too long for what it is. But fun nonethless. Just be sure to take it easy and not fight.

I think that there were revisions of the game: My edition has rules with the blue cover, the tube of glue (eww 12 year old glue), a shorter start player stick and cardboard counter type captain's hats.

Played once, really enjoyed it. Our group of players was a group that played Jyhad a lot back in the 90's, so we were doing a lot of table talk, negotiating, finger-pointing and manipulating.

Negotiation. Brutal negotiation game with "fun" light play. Sounds good, GBs give it 7.6.

Update: got to play this once with 5p. Very tough. There wasn't as much overt negotiation as I thought there would be, though that could just be the crowd. Not sure I enjoy the rather helpless feeling of watching one of your guys get thrown overboard, and also seems like you can be mathematically eliminated from winning well before the end of the game. I'm willing to play it some more though to see if my rating goes up or down.

RATING: 4
Cute, colorful components, but too much to analyze for my tastes. On the front-end the gameplay consists of pure negotiation, but due to no hidden info, immediate ramifications, etc. deals are for the most part actually verifiably lopsided. So playing to win is more about preying on the naive and innocent, or hoping that future promises will be honored. And actually winning very much happens because you were given permission to do so. As a personal preference, I prefer my negotiation games to be based more on bluffing/lying, and reading opponent's intentions than on analysis and predictability. (the exception is the Captain card, which introduces some mind-games)

Also, seems easy to fall behind and not be able to win; seems like that will happen to a few players every game quite early.

Like that the game is pretty mean though. Forcing people's pawns to die is pretty fun! 

Had enjoyment factor as "2" originally, but then I realized that this is actually over an hour long (box says 90 minutes), which means it competes with way too many games for me to really wanna play it again.

I generally don't care for diplomacy games - they feel arbitrary.  Sometimes there's a tactical reason to make a particular play, but then again there's just as often no particularly good strategy other than to decide which player you would rather screw over in your next move.  This is pretty much what Lifeboats is about.  I do like the game thematically, and I like the min maxing component for scoring.  This game needs more than three people.  I think this game is fun in small doses: it's sometimes fun getting into the tense confrontations and the mock alliances and getting people angry at you only to get your ship sunk and then lose the game.  It's just not the kind of game you want to play every Friday night.

Very cruel game. Really, not for the wuss of heart and certainly not to play with your family. I'm Libra. I'm an understanding person, I see the two sides of the coin on one side. This game made me angry at my friends because they threw me overboard.

There isn't much strategy in this game either. I want to win. Who's on my way? Let's convince the other players that this guy's pawns should be tossed overboard. That's it, no other meaningful mechanics, you know it's all a lie because there's no other goal in this game.

The best of this game is its ability to make the most innocent and peaceful friends angry at each other for no reason whatsoever.

PS: also the flow of the game is not so great, as soon as one player is without pawns, he's out of the game for the exception that he can still vote on everything. The game becomes quite silly and the remaining players' pawns feel like puppets because there's 1+ player(s) that have nothing to win in the game anymore and are still playing. This for me is the reason this game sucks, every game becomes absurd as soon as players are 'out of the game' but still voting.

Wow, this is just a cutthroat dirty little game.  I love me some negotiation games but this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth mostly because of player elimination being entirely possible, and that's a no-no in my book.  Really nice production and I'd like to have liked it, but the game seems against you from the start and the battle against others is too susceptible to group think.  Not for me!

Lifeboats is a game about throwing your friends overboard to save yourself and convincing them to kill someone else instead of you.  There is no hidden information aside from trivial card counting, so it's all about sneaking your way past everyone else.  The game is longer and more repetitive than I'd like for a game of its type, and simultaneous action selection is never my favourite mechanic, but the mechanics strongly and appropriately evoke the theme.  In a world without I'm the Boss! and Cosmic Encounter, I'd rate it higher.

1 play. 

AKA The Lifeboat Game. You're trying to get your men safely ashore. A negotiation/voting game where you're trying to drown other player's men or sink the boats. I don't generally like these types of games but Justin convinced me it was fun. It's sort of a negotiation game where you are working with other players (overtly or not). Maybe more of a Werewolf type game, where you're trying to kill off innocent bystanders! You start the game placing a number of men onto lifeboats. Each turn, each player chooses 1 token to jump ship and swim to another boat. They may not go back to the boat they jumped from, and if no other spot is available they drown! Then, one boat (determined by secret vote) springs a leak! if there are more leaks than people, the boat sinks killing everyone on board! 1 ship advances each turn - it takes several advancements to make it safely ashore (where you score points).

It's an exercise in groupthink - figure out when the group is going to sink a boat, and get OFF of it quickly! Share boat space with enough people to keep moving forward, but get more of your own ashore to the most valuable spots.

I don't tend to like these sorts of games (I'm killed early in Werewolf) and I didn't particularly like this one, either.

I just don't see enough strategy here and there's too much opportunity for kingmaking for a game of this length.  In short, it's too random for my taste.  Still kind of fun and an interesting theme.  I wouldn't turn down a game, but I wouldn't suggest it either.

Wonderful game.  Despite the cartoony art and the Euro pieces and mechanics perhaps the meanest game that I have played.  If I play too many co-ops then I often want to play this as an antidote.  It is like the TV show Survivor turned into a board game.  I don't expect to ever win this game, but I will always love the experience.  A wonderful social game of meanness and manipulation.

You need to be able to separate games from the social dynamic which is not a problem for the people that I play with, but not for the thin skinned/

RATING: 6.5
[Walter Muller's 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' 93 edition] {Nautical, survival; negotiation, voting; optimal 6p} It's not easy to design a negotiation game but RSWK works effectively and is highly accessible. It is very thematic to reflect the truth of human (selfish) nature. The boats and voting wheel are very cool! The entire game looks so nice :)

It's so chaotic that a game plan is not necessary. Try to use your negotiation and presentation or even threatening skill to influence other players. However, it's always a good idea to avoid leading in early game.  If you lead, your opponents would just crazily bash you.

I found that all negotiation game has the same problem - it only works only with a right group of players. The players have to be mean, funny, talkative and extrovert. They should be willing to backstab, ready to break promise and don't take things too personal in the game. And, it's not nice to play it with your wife.

This is a good game from Ronald Wettering.  Sadly, it's his only game (recorded in BGG).  I wish he had more games.

[Update] I have a look at Z-man's edition. Nearly everything is the same except cards are used instead of the wheel. It's not as classical look as RSWK (it depends on personal preference). There is no need for me to buy another edition. It's nice that I can have an illustrated English rulebook now :)

I like the idea of this game; I like the idea of a lot of negotiation games, but like Quo Vadis, I feel as though this needs a little more guidance in the negotiations. Perhaps with more plays, this will be more obvious.

There are some games that you play once and will avoid like it's a pariah because the game-play is so poor. There is almost no other game mechanic besides voting in this game. Negotiation is limited because unlike Bohnanza which offers a real trade, this one falls back on making empty promises which may not be kept because of the changing condition. The game is overly long for the simply mechanics it uses and drags on painfully after a while. A very bad buy.

I've played this several times now, and while it does have its merits.  I don't think that there is enough there for me regarding Negotiation.  I like negotiation games.  But I think this one might be too pure.  I'd rather play I'm the Boss, where you are unsure exactly how much money people have.

I think I'd actually enjoy Mall of Horror too, simply because of theme.

I was very sceptic at first. From the rules this game seemed to be rather an exercise for a discussion group. With only the discussion I wouldn't rate this game higher than a 5. But the game mechanic of panicking sailors was a stroke of genius and makes for a highly enjoyable game. An hour to an hour and a half of great fun, simple and short rules. It's meant to be mean and I never thought I'd feel so happy seeing life boats sink.

Mean, mean, mean. You'll probably want to warn people up front that this game is all about being mean, and not in some sort of classic take-that sense. You're openly talking to players about how to screw over other players. If you don't mind that, it's actually not a bad game. The only issues are that there is potential for player elimination, and the rulebook is unclear on a few issues.

This game is everything I wanted it to be: interaction, fickle alliances, interaction, backstabbing, interaction, lying, persuading, interaction, and a lot of laughter. Did I mention interaction?

SUGGESTION: I recommend you require all players to leave their feelings at the door before starting this game. Without this strict rule, it is likely that at least one relationship at the table will never be the same.

One and done. Another comment sums this game up perfectly (paraphrased): "You may as well just have a vote at the beginning of the game to declare the winner."

I really enjoy negotiation-backstab games, but there's just nothing to this one. The board, the boat, the pawns...pointless. It all boils down to who you like, who is in the lead, and who screwed you last round. Vote accordingly. Boo.

Lifeboats uses a voting mechanic that is not for the weak of heart. Those looking to avoid conflict, stay way.

Just agree to remain friends when the game is through.

6.5 after one aborted session. I really want to like this but it seems too open, very much like "Survivor" as a board game. I love the shuffling mechanism and the incentive to diversify one's men across different boats, but the game doesn't provide much guidance as to which boat should get a leak and which should progress. A recipe for hurt feelings I think.

...Tried giving the start player of the turn a nomination privilege to make the voting (for leaks and advancement) faster and less open. Better game but it still has a weird ending as people vote between options that don't affect them and are basically blatantly playing kingmaker.

Also known as 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' ('Each Man for Himself') and often times referred to as 'The Lifeboat Game,' this pure negotiation game puts a different spin on the typical ocean catastrophe. There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon. However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite. To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one. As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn. If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!

Great fun.  You need a crowd who will approach this with the right attitude, but it's pure negotiation and voting people out of the boat.

I can easily see how this would jump up to a THIS GAME IS AWESOME or down to a NEVER EVER pretty fast-- it's a game that completely depends on your group of people (negotiation without stuff to do it with!), and while that's true for every game, it's especially so for this one (you can't just play logically)

RATING: 5
Every player tries to get his meeples to the islands to score points. Each one has small and bigger meeples which are placed on boats at the start of rhe game.
In each round, there is a vote for where the leck is gonna go (if more lecks than people on a boat, it sinks and the meeples are out of the game), then there's a vote for which boat is gonna move one spot nearer to the islands and then you switch your meeples between the boats (everyone puts one out and places it on a different boat)
All the votes are conducted the same way, the more votes a boat gets, that boat is the winner. Everyone has a captain which can neglect every decision and do what he wants.
I really enjoyed the game but I played with 6 and half of them hated it so I gave it a 5.

voting where you have to go to the tie-breaker WAY too often. player elimination. the game should essentially be based on negotiation, but all you have to negotiate with is your vote.  this requires the group to be prone to lively negotiation ALREADY, rather than fostering it...  so you could be playing a better game with the same group.

This game is pretty good, lots of interaction between the players. I don't enjoy it as much as I thought I would though. Perhaps the experience is spoiled by one particular player who grumbles and complains the whole game if you happen to backstab or slight him in anyway. I have tried pointing out that this is the essence of the game and is what is supposed to make it fun, but he doesn't seem to understand. So, I wouldn't recommend playing it with people like this. To my surprise, my 11 year old brother and his friends immensely enjoy this game and never get upset if you happen to lie to them. In fact, they get resourceful and usually form an alliance if one of the adults underhands them.

Light fun that can be good as a gateway game.  Quite fast.  There's a little bit of variation to make things interesting, with things like officers and the tiebreak, but it's mostly quite simple.  There's a huge amount of chaos, of course.  And it is fun to chuck people over the side.  The lighthearted theme is fun.  The ending is rather anticlimactic, with the last boat always advancing.  I'd prefer if it automatically sank.  There's a lot of gang up on the leader, so this is one of those games where it pays to be in second or third, and make your big push at the end.

This game needs the right sort of crowd, who can get into bartering and not take it too seriously.  I'm surprised with how well balanced all the mechanisms are.  It definitely takes more than one playing to really get the game.  Shoot, it probably takes more than TWO playings....

Si cerca di portare in salvo dopo un disastroso naifragio il maggior numero di passeggeri del proprio colore giocando carte ruolo che permettono ai naifraghi di spostarsi da una scialuppa ad un altra.

Wow, a very fun game full of treachery and backstabbing. Because of this darker nature, it might be best avoided when gaming with folks who take games to seriously or take in game actions personally

I've played this game quite a bit lately and really enjoy it.  It is a cut-throat game and there can be quite a bit of nastiness, but with the right group this is a gem.

A little bit of placement strategy,  but the game is pretty much pure negotiation.

Boats, art work and theme increase rating by one at least. Good clean nasty fun! Maybe should be 45 mins to hr though.

Definitely a fun game, but it can matter who you play with. Dont bring any of your old wargaming friends for this one. Possibly a good party game, but it might last a little long. Too bad it's only in german as far as I know unless you make your own...

My problem with games like this is the voting structure.  What ends up happening is everyone wants to vote me out, not necessarily win the game.  In the end, I'd rather play Mall of Horror.

I got this one after watching an episode of Board Games With Scott.  I've only played it a handful of times since and I'm not sure what I think yet.  I want to like it more than I do.

Played a few times (with 5 or 6 players). I am not too fond of this kind of games, where the most valuable skill to do well is usually discretion. However, the mechanics work quite well (one might wonder more about the theme) - though it might be a bit repetitive.

The democratic way to screw your friends. Should be better if it took less time to finish.
Because you need 6 players to enjoy this game the most, I sold my copy.

A back-stabby negotiation game where there were opportunities for sneaky moves to put yourself ahead, but only with the risk of being picked on afterwards.

I really like negotiation games, but am probably too talky for my own good in this one.  I can see where this would easily lead to hurt feelings with the wrong group, especially if you get shut out of winning early as your guys get tossed overboard... but with a bunch of thick skinned gamers with a taste for screwage this can be a pretty fun game.

RATING: 7
Very similar to the game Mall of Horrors, and just as cruel.  I really like these voting for people to die games.  Player interaction is extremely high and there is really no down time at all.  One downside is that you really do need as many players as you can get a hold of, I can't imagine the game being any good with just 3 people.

After 1 Game: Open negotiation is my very least favorite style of game, and I have yet to play one that I enjoy.  If you enjoy that style of game, you'll probably like this (it does have very nice bits).  If like me you aren't too keen on this type of game, Lifeboats is not going to change that opinion.

This game is just covered in diplomacy and player deals. I like the negotiation aspect, but like any diplomacy-heavy game, factors outside of the game will influence decisions. My experience sees these influences more in a kingmaking position, which is my other dislike of this game. Despite the kingmaking and weird negotiations at times, I enjoyed the screw factor. Overall, this is a decent game.

The game falls short, as it lacks any sort of substance.  Negotiation is a weak element to soley base a game off of.  Also, the art is awful.

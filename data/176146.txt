GAME: The Lamps Are Going Out
RANK: 3334
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quick, easy, clever, detailed; though the rules and the  card texts' spartan austerity of wordage, expressed in 5-point font, should generate a page of clarification.
Gets better on repeated playing. The obvious comparator is Paths of Glory, and Lamps beats this game soundly, as if by design, in the areas where PoG failed: the Bolshevik Revolution process, the out-of-supply encirclement nonsense,  American entry. 
Events are relatively few in number, but in combination with rapidly developing war technology they beat the ' card events versus all other uses' dilemma that hobbled PoG's design. 
Turns play fast and although the game can end quickly, campaigns have to be developed slowly over many turns to avert devastating counterattacks. Players have to judge finely just how many armies are required for attack or defence, and when to stop pressing attacks. Longer games are likely to be the preserve of the experienced player, but there'll be excitement & interest throughout. Recommended.

Resume la Gran Guerra en pocos turnos pero sin tener mecánicas demasiado simples. Muy bien logrado el equilibrio entre los diversos frentes.
Algo repetitivo el sistema de combate.
Mucha dificultad para los rusos de evitar que les conquisten toda Rusia.
Dispone de cartas para diferentes eventos pero no es un CDG. Se puede disputar perfectamente en solitario al no tener información secreta ni manos de cartas.
Modificaciones de internet para más realismo (Tecnología, ataques italianos y rusos).

A (relatively) fast playing WW! game. A bit reliant on cards drawn and rolls but still plenty of nail biting choices to be made. After Last Blitzkrieg, probably my game of 2016.

RATING: 7.5
A lighter war game in the class of 1775.  Easy to learn, plays 2 to 4 but probably best with 2 or 3.  If playing with 3, I'd probably give Italy to the Russians to play to balance out the action a bit more.  Surprisingly good feel for the flow of events at a grand strategy level for such a simple game.

RATING: 9.3
Played 4 sessions and The Lamps are going out is simply one of the best wargames I played in recent years, ... and I have 100's of them.
Very solo friendly. It is MUCH more realistic than Paths of Glory while having 30% of that game's rules difficulty.
Actually, it just toppled Guns of August as my favorite WW1 wargame and this after 30+ years. 
Its strong points:
1. Very Solo friendly.
2. Relative short playing time for this kind of full WW1 simulation: 5-6 hours.
3. Its clear and easy remembered sequence of play.
4. A vastly superior realistic feeling of WW1 than PoG
5. The card mechanics offer a great tension and varied strategy throughout the game
6. With very little rules overhead it produces quite a great overview of all theaters.
7. It has a superb but simple Production scheme that drives the game's choices.

A must buy.

Birthday Gift 2016.
My rating is based on the system.  I really like how the game played and the use of cards is :cool:  However, after playing such a well organized, low density WWI game I have come to the conclusion that I would only really game WWI once in a great while.  So I give this an :d10-8: for the game system but really would only rarely suggest the game myself given it is WWI.

RATING: 3
Like almost every other Comass game I've played, this felt severely undercooked. Very random, very overlong. The economic system has the unfortunate feature that due to high production levels and the fact that production occurs at the end of your turn  losses are often free to replace, so the game encourages you to play out ridiculous long-shots or offensives with minimal upsides simply because they're free. WWI games have to work hard to avoid turning into a grind, and this did not.

The research system is also a real mess. Not only is whether you get tech advances very random, but getting a few tech advances just makes it far more likely you'll get even more tech advances in the future. Plus there is no way for the players to influence this - you can't spend more money on research to catch up, or limit your focus to necessary tech. You just flip a card each turn and if you get something, awesome, and you're going to get further and further ahead (on average) at a significantly accelerating pace while your opponent sits there frustrated and impotent. The events are similarly ridiculously swingy for a game of this length.

I think that's the bottom line for me; of this took 3hr to play, I think it would have been fine and the crazy randomness would be tolerable. But this is 6, 8 hours, maybe even more  to plow through if it goes the distance (which is likely unless someone gets lucky). That's almost Paths of Glory length, it's not even *that* much simpler, and Paths of Glory is (despite its own non-trivial flaws) a vastly superior game.

For the last shot I'll take at this game, the text on the cards is frustratingly vague. Compass still has very little discipline when it come to writing rules generally.

Anyway, I'd avoid. It's not awful, it has a few clever ideas, but there is just a lot better stuff out there. Quartermaster General: 1914 is a vastly better WWI game, for example. Paths of Glory is more time and effort, but with a much better payoff. And I'm optimistic for Fields of Despair.

Meh.  It was nice, but did get pretty damn tedious.  I was really wanting to just give up near the end.

It can also feel outrageously luck-based.

RATING: 7
Decent lightweight WW1 game. The rulebook is a bit longer than I would like, as is the playing time, but the actual mechanics are fairly straightforward once you get through it.

Complaints include a heavy amount of wristage and the tech advances can tilt too heavily if one side gets on a roll because of the deck-thinning nature of the current rules. I'm tempted to house rule that unresearchable techs are set aside until a researchable tech is found. Then, and only then, are they reshuffled back in.

Overall, the game is pretty much what it's advertised to be, though whether or not it's your cup of tea is another story. Given the actual 5-6 hour playing time (or more), I'm not sure if I see this as a game that's going to fire [i]Paths of Glory[/i], which is maybe twice as long at worst, but also has twice the depth.

Still, it's a keeper for now since it's a one-session game and, to be fair, it does do a couple things that PoG doesn't, such as the choice to invest in a surface and/or submarine fleet. Plus, I don't have to worry about my entire army being cut out of supply because of a single corps, armed with satellite intelligence, making a gamey sweeping maneuver through rear areas on the last impulse. Whether or not that's enough to bring it to the table ahead of PoG remains to be seen.

RATING: 8
Rules are simple and easy to learn. Game is mostly balanced with a decent chance for either side to win. Entire game can be played in 6-8 hours. Needs a bigger map board and mounted. Germany and France need a couple more provinces on the western front to give a little room for maneuver but other than that, a good light wargame that feels like a WWI game due to the mechanics and historical flavor from the event and tech cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice World War I War game, at approximately the same scale as Paths of Glory.  Nice mechanics keep the rules down (feels quite simple, but not simplistic), and the well thought out card decks drive a nice narrative.  The random "will I or won't I?" draws off the technology decks seem a bit odd and unfair, but it all seems to work.  I really like how you must keep the attrition pressure on the opposition, otherwise they will refit and whack you if you let them back on their feet.  Very impressed - feels a little like War of the Ring, surprisingly, but much longer than that game.  Still, I think this one has driven Paths of Glory out the collection - really liked it.

I've playtested this game any number of times over the last 2 or 3 years. It was better than most published games two years ago and it has gotten even better than that since then. As far as I can tell it's the finest World War I game you can play in an evening. Plus it doesn't insult your intelligence as a historian. Simple, quick, elegant and fun plus it gives you a feel for what the highest level commanders had to deal with. What more could you want?

RATING: 5
Lamps plays out like WWI.  Though Lamps addresses what bugged some people about Paths of Glory, where rather a-historical situations can arise, it feels way more of a grind to play.   The combat system, while simple, is A LOT of dice rolling , and not the good old bucket-of-dice in blocks game.    In block games players roll a whole bunch of dice at once. In Lamps each player throws dice for every unit that goes to combat, flips at least one counter and repeats again and again.  Then allocates production  and regroups and so flips counters back for every faction round of which there are 4 per turn.  So the game is not really fast paced like advertised. It is really only about a 1/3 shorter than PoG but with far less decisions you need to make.   Perhaps that is why it feels like a grind to play.   The 4 hour playing time listed is off by 100%. 

The Tech race mechanism can lead to situations where it really goes one sided.  If one side has particularly bad luck, they could lag badly in Techs while the other side accelerates in Tech and there is nothing the bad lucked player can do about it.

The Naval aspect is more interesting that PoG.   It is one step less abstracted and so lets the player make more meaningful decision on Naval deployment. 

Still not a bad game.  I would play it again.   Maybe split it up into 2 game sessions to keep it fresh.

But given the option, I'd play Paths of Glory over this every time.  Way more fun.

Yes there are sometimes wild swings with the tech cards (which it could be argued adds to the challenge), but this is an eminently replayable and interesting game which does a terrific job of simulating WW1 grand strategy and is playable in 5-6 hours.

The combat sytem models the WW1 war of attrition superbly and the game succeeds in putting the players in the mindset of the historical commanders; no small feat at this scale.

Minor quibble that I would have preferred some variability in when the game ends (it is fixed at Fall 1918) but that does not detract from the overall package. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
So many things to like here but in the end I think it's too long with too much counter-flipping. My plays have been solo.

The event deck is great, bringing out events in a controlled random way, so things feel very historical but are not completely predictable. The ruleset is simple and the game is easy to play. The large areas and movement restrictions mean you worry about army allocation to the fronts you want to fight, instead of maneuvering and supply.

But I think what kills it is the battle and production system. Every turn each side has to attack five to ten times, which means flipping a bunch of counters over, which are just going to get flipped back over at the end of the turn. Every single turn for the whole game you go through this process, and it gets tiresome. By the end of the game I don't have the heart to attack any more. Even if you don't want to gain more territory, you have to attack because that's how you exhaust your opponent's pieces to prevent him from taking your areas. 

My only other comparison is Paths of Glory, and while it's one of my favorite games of all time, it's too much for me to play solo. Too complex, too long. But I'm not sure I'll have the heart to pull Lamps out again.

bleh. 

Rich-get-richer technology system and very repetitive turns of making spoiling attacks because defending is a losing game - losses for Germany and the Western Allies are essentially free to replace, trenches are semi-useless, and the attacker winning ties along with the 'big push' mechanic gives the attacker a big advantage.

I also suspect that unless the Central Powers get really lucky in 1914/1915, the fact that they are simply outnumbered by the Triple Entente means that the line will snap somewhere in late 1916.

This has to be only game I have seen that puts Russian and Italian troops at the same capability as the Germans...

If the technology system was something other than what it is AND the game was about half as long as it actually is (~8 hours), the rating might be a tad higher.  But not much.

Very accessible WWI grand strategy game and I appreciate it for that. It's on the lighter side though and luck seemed to have a major impact in the one game I played. You have very limited to ways to mitigate the luck of the die in battles. Most battles are being fought with a 58% chance for the attacker to win. That's just slightly above a coinflip. And whether you have any technological advances (which are critical since these open up the few ways to influence the odds) is entirely up to the luck of the draw. With a shorter play time I would be willing to accept that. As it is I would much rather invest the additional few hours to play Paths of Glory instead.

I have not enjoyed this at all, although I had quite high hopes. It is too mechanical, it does seem to not provide much in way of showing depletition of manpower. Research although interesting is totally random as many other things in game.

I quite liked this low-complexity take on the grand strategical WW1 conflict. My only problem, really, is with the length. 
Very good at making you attack with no chance of success but for strategic reasons.

Very nice, simple game. The four-player option is a godsend.

Sadly, the card's text is much too tiny, to make it almost unreadable on many cases. If I can get my hands on the graphic files I will gladly make a more playable set, with larger fonts, and the non-critical "eye candy" graphics reduced.

RATING: 5.5
It has lots of clever elements, the technology progression, the events adding to but not driving the game, simple and clean sub-systems.  However, I think the game is too long for what it is.  With four separate player-turns each year and the combat system that involves a LOT of die-rolling and modifiers, it just takes a while to play (to be fair, it was a long war).  Also the combat resolution can be kind of "swingy" and it's difficult to predict how much force you need in an area to prevent a breakthrough.  If I'm going to spend that much time playing a WW1 game, there are others I'd rather play.

Excellent WWI strategic game, easy to learn, playable in 5-7 hours, with numerous strategic options and a good replayability. After 3  full games I can say it's a very well balanced game.

In Spring 1916 of my first solitaire play-through and am enjoying the experience immensely thus far! The Germans/Central Powers are behind schedule in some ways, but making up for it in others. This could well have solid replay-ability and is thus far superior to the near chess-like play of PoG whose one mistake and it's over / tournament type of play lost my interest years ago.

Two quibbles:
The rules are not as well organized as would first appear. When a situation arises wherein I have a question, or something I'm sure I read starts nagging at me, I've had trouble finding it in the book. Maybe an index or something could be made?

The second is a slight disappointment with respect to the event card play: there are more cards than can be played in a single game which results in actual events that occurred during the war  - some minor, some major - not happening at all.

Based on one play. It really had the FEEL of WWI - in our game, the Germans bogged down quickly on the West Front, but with Production transfers to their Austrian allies, delivered a Tannenburg Forest-like crippling blow to the overextended Russians. The tech cards and event cards added another level of detail. Not much to dislike, except the time it took.

Very much looking forward to this one.
It has an unrepentant grand view of the war: there is no maneuver, just allocation of forces and going for the Big Push. Not a sandbox, but the event cards mix things up within the usual strictures. Works better for two than four, still solid with only one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are aspects of the design that I really appreciate, and I commend it for its firm focus on the strategic--maneuver enthusiasts will have to look elsewhere, as the name of the game is resource allocation and attempting to overwhelm your opponent through an accumulation of blows.  That said, the game stretches too long for what it gives you, and the combat mechanism is repetitive in the extreme.  Ultimately, I felt like Quartermaster General 1914 did all of the same things in a tighter, faster-playing package.

I think that there is a good game in here.  The game does have a buckets of dice feel with limited strategic options.

I might up the rating once the rules are cleaned up.  My 1st play was marred by the constant need to try and figure out how cards and game properly interacted.  Card text could have been way better written.

A found Lamps to be a terrific quick playing, strategic game on WWI easily beating out an old favorite WWI by SPI/Decision. The event and technology cards ad a lot of historical flavor to the game and I liked how the naval & U-boat aspect was included. it plays very well solitaire. Overall very well designed. My only gripe is the small font on the army counters.

RATING: 8
Streamlined design but there are a lot of rules to remember (I respectfully disagree with comments that this game is simple/low-complexity, at least while learning). Nonetheless, actually playing the game is not as difficult as the rules would make it seem because things are rather elegant.

This is a roll-push-repeat type of design, while managing units and resources (interesting decision trees are presented to the players). Biggest criticism is that it plays too long for what it is (grand strategic). The Event cards needed better explanation, also.

Rules could have been better organized (needs an an index, too). There are a handful of exceptions that could have been referenced better (I took notes).

There's a nice balance of playability with historical flavor here. Lamps does not have the tension of PoG, but it is easier to play and fun (even though not very exciting).

Solid game at first play - I think the design does accomplish its goal. So glad they pulled this game from a wasteland company like VPG.

Initially really liked it, but after multiple plays the strategic options seem few and the combat resolution is quite grinding, with a combat needing perhaps 12 or more rolls of the dice and still being almost irrelevant.

It's just far too long for the entertainment is provides.

Bought it and sold it.

 I played a few games both FtF and against opponents and whilst it has some nice features, it was way to random for me and I have now sold it.   

Technology and events have a big impact on the game and are random.  I have also seen extreme bad luck/good luck with combat die rolls, which again are massive in effect with little ability to plan/mitigate for them.  e.g. Serbia can either die in the first few turns or survive and cause long term problems for the Cent Powers, most of which is dependent on Events Cards draws and a few dice rolls - in one game Serbia will die straight away, others it will survive even through the deployment of forces and attacks will be the same.

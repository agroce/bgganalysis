This is one of my absolute favorite games.  It's just a shame that it is so difficult to find anymore.  Tile laying isn't my favorite mechanic, but something about this game just does it for me.  It's an absolutely beautiful game on the table and it's so easy to teach and play.

This is a really good Carcassonne-esque game for only two. It plays out in two phases: tile placement then meeple placement. The first is a game of chicken and the second pure placement smarts (it is completely solvable). For a two-player Carc-like game, it is really very good. This is not something I would often have a situation to play (and would probably prefer Carc itself for 2). So not something I will own, but would certainly play again to pass the time with two.

RATING: 7.5
I'm impressed with this little jewel of a game.  The first half is a cousin (no more than that) of Carcassonne and maybe the tile laying part of Hellas.  You place tiles to try and give yourself an advantage and place up to 4 farms on freshly laid tiles in order to potentially maximise your score later.  The second part of the game is reminiscent of Go and Hey that's My Fish!, in that you try to close off areas that only you can exploit.  Unlike HTMF, you don't do that by moving your pieces around but by placing tokens (fields) to block your opponent out.  Anyway, the rules say that you should play 3 times and add the scores.  I found that two plays were enough, but you can do as many as you like really.  I'd also imagine that adding an extra set of tiles would be cool if you REALLY like the game.

Anyway, it's fun, quick and satisfying.

[i]Posted: 4/29/13, Rated: 8[/i]

The meta story: I never pulled the trigger on this little game when it was readily available.  Now it is out of print, and I was fortunate enough to pick up a copy in a reasonable trade.  Even though I feel like I got a good deal on a game that is in high demand, I am inclined to think well of it to justify having traded away more in value for it than I would have paid just a few years ago.

Additionally, [person=57][/person] passed away back in 2007.  I have several of his games, and I am always [article=5517877]saddened[/article] when I think that he is no longer here to share his passion for designing games with us.  This melancholy makes me inclined to think well of his games.

So it should come as no surprise that I ended up liking this game.  The artwork is reminiscent of [i][thing=822][/thing][/i], even though the artists are not the same.  Tile laying and then optionally playing a meeple-like farm only further the comparison.  It is a poor comparison though, as [i]Fjords[/i] is its own game.

The first phase of a game round spent laying tiles.  As you go you can play your farms, which are the anchor points for claiming your territory in the second phase.  This idea of building the board before playing upon it is reminiscent of [i][thing=4099][/thing][/i], or a 2D version of [i][thing=24508][/thing][/i].  I really enjoy this mechanism.

The second phase is spent placing "fields" in such a way as to limit the options of your opponent.  Think [i][thing=503][/thing][/i], or a ridiculously simplified version of [i][thing=188][/thing][/i].  Where [i]Fjords[/i] shines is in its streamlined nature: an entire round will be over in fifteen minutes, maybe sooner.  Play three separate rounds (starting anew each time; only your score carries over), and you're done.

A quick game that is visually appealing, contains classic elements of strategy, and doesn't take up a lot of space is a surefire winner.  I only wish that I could thank its designer personally for creating such a gem.

Fjords plays quickly and involves a fair amount of chance, but contains opportunities for strategic play as well. Occasionally tile placement is forced, but there are often at least two or three options. The ability to draw a face up tile mitigates the chance factor and is a very nice design choice. The contrast between stages is a little different (and can pose a conceptual challenge for some), but I enjoy attempting to set up a strong position in the first phase despite the uncertainty inherent in the game. My only complaint (besides the poorly drawn 'mountains' -- they look like fungus) is that the second stage is not complex enough -- it's can be too obvious where to play for both sides. Perhaps combining two sets would help. Overall, Fjords strikes a very nice balance between play time and strategic depth, and is a great game in a small, unassuming package. (2008-10)

Update: Upon further reflection and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/781388/informal-experiment-how-easy-to-find-the-optimal-d]this excellent thread[/url], I retract my earlier statement about phase two placement being too obvious (or at least heavily qualify it to say that placement [i]can[/i] be obvious in [i]certain[/i] board/hut arrangements). Fjords is an [b]excellent[/b] two player game: good strategic depth, accessible rules, and quick to play. Through the Desert still has an edge over Fjords due to its greater scope for varied strategies (and, if one plays three rounds of Fjords to balance out the random tile draws, it plays in about the same time), but Fjords is a wonderful game. [8.5 -> 9] (2014-04)

RATING: 6
Two player, two part game. You first want to lay tiles in a way that benefits the placement of your four farms. Once the tiles are exhausted and island is complete, you begin laying fields next to your farms and previously placed fields. The choices here are usually very obvious and victory is heavily dependent on the tile placement in the first half of the game. Not my favorite two player game by any means but it is an enjoyable change of pace. 

Update: It never gets played - traded.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A charming and fast-playing 2-player tile game that makes an awful lot out of very few pieces. It seems to have got most things just right: the theme, the game length, the amount of tiles and playing pieces available, and the landscape tile mix that strikes a nice balance between random draws that create opportunities and those that give you problems.

The game splits in two halves, but the second phase is just an elaborate way to determine the final score, by making a game out of an obvious sequence of best-moves, determined by who is the first player to start claiming territory from a handful of bases. Two competent players will easily spot the optimum way to play out the second phase, and might as well plonk the stones down in mutual agreement after the first phase has been played out, rather than going through a turn-taking charade, briefly playing out the inevitable "solution".

It does put the entire game in the first phase, but that is a beauty. It does feel a bit like playing Go whilst drawing a patchy grid-pattern underneath. Placing your stones to control the outcome on a finished board, and placing tiles to create the board underneath all at the same time is quite neat. With only a limited amount of bases available, knowing when and where to commit your four villages is key. Getting hemmed in as costly as getting hemmed out.

Some people will dislike the random draw-and-play mechanism, as forward planning is seriously hampered by not knowing if the next terrain tile will let you play anywhere near current hot-spots. To us that wasn't an issue. Regardless of the tile drawn, it nearly always resulted in a genuine [i]"is placing a village now wise?"[/i] moment. When a crisp game keeps you thinking all the way through, as each move matters [i]a lot[/i], and a round only takes 5 to 10 minutes, then instantly playing several more rounds isn't something you do because the rules suggest it, it is something that comes natural, and a true mark of the design skills of the author.

The first player to place in the territory claiming phase has a huge advantage on the relatively small area, one that should never be given up, making the manner in which the last few tiles are chosen very important. This also means that forcing an early end to the placement phase is only an option for the opening player, which maybe off sets some of the disadvantage of going first. However, for balance sake it is better to play an even amount of rounds to determine the overall winner, rather than the 3 suggested.

It is the sort of game that makes you wonder how it would play if you combined several sets. I don't think it would improve on the nature of the game, or even make it better, but I would happily welcome a longer game using the same mechanism. It might add a bit more weight to an enjoyable lightweight, and possibly invite itself to the table more frequently.

This is a very light game and doesn't require too much strategy, but it is fun. I would rate it a "5" but it is quickly becoming a favorite of many of my non-gamer friends.

Tile-placement phase is fun.  I will say that whether a tile fits in a certain space is not as intuitive as some other similar games, making it take longer than it should to figure out where one can place a tile.  But for the most part, it plays well, looks good, and can fool one into thinking it's a "spouse" game.

Piece-placement phase isn't really fun, though to be fair it's more of a way to score how well you did in the tile-placement phase.  The player who goes first in this phase has a big advantage and will more often that not win the round.  You can try to time it a little so you'll be the beneficiary, but to some people who can't (or won't) see that part of the game, it will be very frustrating.  (Somewhat like how some people don't "get" farmer scoring in Carcassonne, except in this game, the frustrating part can't be avoided.)

All in all, a nice but somewhat flawed game that I can't recommend.  Too light for hobbyists, too unforgiving for casual gamers.

Good "2 players" tile placement abstract game. Very simple to learn in 2 minutes. It's an abstract game with eurogame looking.

Create a map and conquer more territory than your opponent. Forget the comparisons with Carcassonne, it's another think only similar because you take a facedown tile and try to fit in a turn by turn growing map.

The only objection to the game is that the discovering phase take too much time and the conquer phase is very quick although is the more exciting and important to define the winner. 

Home made.

I'm pleasantly surprised with this. There's a nice bit of strategy and some good game packed in this little box. The comparisons to Carcassonne are obvious, but the big difference (aside from the lack of expansions, which is maybe a Good Thing?) is that in Fjords, the players are thinking of the endgame from the first tile. There are fewer tiles, and every one counts. Do you place one of your four farms now, or wait in the hope that you'll draw a tile that will allow a better placement? You don't have long to decide.

Pretty simple hex bared tile laying game, where you fit 2 sides of a hex against existing tiles, a la carcassonne and place 1 of 4 houses if you want. Once all tiles are laid, place disks adjacent to one of your houses or other disks and block the other player where you can. Score points equal to the number of disks you lay.  Play best of 3.

A nice mix between Carcassonne and Go.
In the first phase its more like Carc, and in the next phase its more like Go.

Nice blocking-rule when it comes to using the mountains.
Can be really evil games.

Found a great deal on Ebay and didn't pass up this out of print game. Great components. Plays in 30 minutes. I put my copy in a bag and have taken it camping, on trips, to work, lots of places. Only downside is Erin doesn't seem to be that into the game, never requested by her. I thoroughly enjoy it.  Update: I do like this, but haven't had great response with other players.  Up for trade.

A simple area control, tile-laying game, more of an abstract spatial puzzle than Carcassonne. The first part gets a little boring and repetitive after awhile, compared to the second half, which is super fun but is too short. I don't know. I like it, but don't think I'd choose to play it over Carcassonne.

The game feels tighter than I expected it to, and placing farms in the first stage is much more important than I expected. On the other hand, the second stage of placing fields went more quickly than I thought it would. I look forward to playing this again, especially since it's such a short game. The rating is more likely to go up than down.

RATING: 4
Fun enough but, the board set up has very few decisions to make.  Each tile draw either fits in 1 place, or occasionally in 2 places, or does not fit.  This has the effect of randomly generating the board with essentially zero playing decisions.

Subsequently, the claiming of territory also has relatively few decisions to be made because their are a maximum of 40 tiles and many tile boundaries are blocked by mountains.  The mechanic is Go-like but, it is a very generous comparison indeed to Go or even to Through the Desert.

Once the players know the game, you can blast through it 15 minutes and have a laugh or two.  Through the Desert is a much more replayable and engaging game with only a slightly longer time commitment.

Quite impressed with this game as a replacement to 2-player Carcassonne.  There is not as much thinking involved, if you can believe that, because the number of options for you turn is usually limited.  It plays much faster though.  There is not much to the end game in my opinion, which doesn't help.

Pretty clever tile laying game! It's a little clunky when hex tiles don't match and you have to cast them to the side, but I like the two-part tile lay then land grab. Pretty neat.

Sure, it's a bit like Carcassonne, but it's unique enough to stand on its own. Deserves a few more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game has a nice short set of rules, that are clearly explained (with the exception of the confusing start diagram).  Each round is divided into two phases.  First, tiles are pulled and the board pieced together.  When placing a new tile, you may place a barn, which is basically a basecamp for building in the second phase.  In the second phase, players take turns placing pieces out from their barns.  This phase moves very quickly as each tries to cut the other off from blocks of land.  This is one of the most intuitive tile-laying games we've tried.  We usually only play 1 round instead of 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Certainly not bad, and if you're thinking thjat is damning with faint praise, you'd be right.  Simple, light, fast, but overall seems too short and too constrained for the game's potential.  Seems like there should be 30% - 50% more tiles and one more farm house per player in order to make the final filling stage challenging.

Mechanics: Tile Placement, Area Control

When I purchased this, I was a bit worried it was going to be a lesser, or lighter version of Carcassonne. However I'm quite pleased to find that it's a solid tile placement game. Not lesser or lighter, just different. I miss the sprawling, table consuming tiles compared to Carcassonne, Fjords comes with far fewer tiles, but as a 2 player game, it serves as a quick playing alternative. 

The biggest difference in play mechanics is that Fjords is primarily an area-control focused game. In Carc, once you have claimed a feature, it's rare that someone is going to take that from you. In Fjords, the tables can be turned throughout the entire game as you try to block your opponent from choice areas of land - and they do the same to you. In the second part of each round, you then battle it out "Go" style on the landscape you've just created. Two games in one.

I am not usually one for area-control games, but with the addition of the tile-laying strategies, 2-phase rounds, and variability, this one is a winner. My husband is also a big fan and this hits the table at home when we want a heavier game in an hour or less.

RATING: 4
The rules of Fjord are taught in a few minutes, but especially seasoned tile-layers are advised to study them carefully. Despite just screaming 'Carcassonne', Fjorde is not Carcassonne. In fact, if you play it like Carcassonne, you lose: the timing and placement of the huts will be all wrong. And once the crucial influence marker phase comes along, it'll be too late. Despite only taking about 10% of the game's total playing time, that marker phase must be foremost in your mind when and where you place tiles and huts. Unfortunately, it is also quite a blind guess because you can't predict what you will draw. Fjord is therefore deeper than you'd expect from just reading the rules, but not in a very satisfying way. It is simply impossible to steer the game in the direction you want it to go. Despite the annoying imbalance between the two phases (meaning that the end doesn't feel as one&mdash;you will want to keep on playing) Fjorde remains a small and somewhat agreeable little filler which at least is over and done with in a small amount of time.

Nevertheless, I and my girlfriend discovered better fillers after we bought this, and so the game was let go from our collection.

Nice, tight two player game. It has the appearance of being a Carcassonne clone, but the second phase, where the fields are claimed sets the game apart. Because everything comes down to the fields that can be claimed, the tile laying in the first phase is very strategic, too. The field claiming then becomes nearly an abstract exercise in trying to shut your opponent out of the best areas before he does the same to you.

Nice looking game which consists of a set-up phase and a take-land phase. The first phase is carcassonne-like and decides mostly the outcome since in the second part the moves are too obvious. The fact that you should play it 3 times to have 'one game' is a pretty silly rule.

It's Carcassonne light for two people (which in of itself isn't all that inspiring) but it's good.  If you don't have time to figure out the farmers at the end of a Carcassonne game, this one is probably a better bet.  It's also more portable.

Phase 1 = Carcassonne, Phase 2 = Go.

Cool.

We've got two Fjords sets and we play a single round using all tiles and 6 farms apiece. The extra three starting tiles begin the game as 3 "open choices". Other than that, we don't change any rules and it works amazingly well... significantly better than the original. (It really needed more tiles. 37 landscape placements was just too few.)

The Carcassonne-meets-Go comments are apt. Place your huts carefully in the first phase so that you can claim the most territory in the second. Going first in the second phase usually is critical to securing the highly contested territories. Unfortunately, finding a strategy that will increase your odds of going first in phase two is problematic.

Players take turns drawing a hex tile and building a map of an area surrounding a fjord.  Terrain consists of sea, mountains or fields.  After placing a tile, the player can place a log cabin down on the tile.  Once the tiles are placed, players take turns placing farm tokens on the built map, trying to be the player to take the most territory.  A very light, pleasant, two player game, that is similar to playing Carcassonne for 10 minutes (build the map), then Durch die Wueste for 45 seconds (place the farms).  There is nothing wrong with it, aside from the fact the decisions seem restricted.  There is usually only one or two places to build a tile, and the farm claiming is very obvious.

The game is played in two phases: the first phase, placing tiles and farms, mixes luck and skill; the second phase, claiming fields, has a Go-like enclosure dynamic that is all skill.  Aesthetically pleasing game, plays fast, quick to learn and teach, compact and portable. Memo: my sister's rating (7) and my wife's rating (6.75).

carcasonne like game with hexagons instead of squares. also first the board is created and then areas are clamed. 2 player

Excellent design. A nice filler with elements of Carcassonne and Through the Desert. The tile placement rules keep the region from being too "stringy". It's amazing how frequent it occurs that a tile is unplayable, and must be set aside into the face up pile.

Nice create-your-territory-then-control-it type of game. But as a 2-player tile-laying game, it didn't feel as 'open' as Carc: The Castle, though. IMO, tile placement felt obvious and constrained.

I tend to like this type of tile placement game, but was left wondering if it should have more of something.  More tiles .... or even lots more tiles.  Still, I liked it.  The level of challenge is dependent on your opponent's skill.
Update: became aware of 'mega Fjords' played by adding 2 sets together to increase the # of tiles.  At the same time I've come to appreciate the abstract simplicity of the challenge. Increased rating.

[4 plays] I wanted to like this more than I do.  Most of those I played it with found it not interesting enough to play three identical rounds--and to add insult to injury, they criticized the game while beating the stuffing out of me.  I would like to give the Mega-Fjords version a chance--this is a variant where you have 2 Fjords sets, and combine them to play one round only with twice the pieces.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) This is essentially what you would get if you distilled [gameid=822] into a two-player game, made the tiles hexagonal, and only played with farmers. A fast, easy-to-learn area control game which makes for a perfect filler with surprising depth.

A lovely little two phase tile placement and area control game where first you discover a fjord area (draw a tile and place it), plop your farms down to claim land, and then later in the second phase you expand your farms outward with fields to control the surrounding areas in a similar fashion as Taluva. Play 3 rounds of these two phases, and the person with the most points at the end wins! I would liken it to Kingdomino in that the rules are simple and easy to learn, setup is quick and easy, and they are both fast playing. Unlike Kingdomino though this has a little bit more depth, but is also slightly more subject to luck of the draw as with Kingdomino you have multiple terrain types to choose from and you have  a say in what you choose rather than a blind draw. You might think that playing all 3 rounds is unnecessary, however we've had some close matches and comebacks from that final round so it seems to mitigate the luck of the tile draw somewhat. While this lacks the beauty of Kingdomino it more than makes up for it in the smaller table footprint and the excellent gameplay where we felt Kingdomino was a bit lacking.

The artwork of this game is fairly nondescript but the overall feeling, especially with the little wooden houses, is very charming. It's very cool how the map develops differently every time. The game plays smoothly and has two distinct kinds of feelings – in the first phase it is slower as there is some pondering over the tile placement (both legal and strategic) and deciding whether to place a farm or not, while in the second phase it's a snappy free-for-all land grab. There's a bit of risk in choosing where to place your farms as you can't be quite sure how the landscape will develop and if you will be helped or hindered in future, a bit of tactics in deciding whether to place now or later, where to place certain tiles and your farms plus your crucial field placements, whether to take from the open choice tiles or the face down pile as the tiles also act as a timer and first field placement chooser, and a fair bit of luck hoping the tiles will come out great on your turn. Maneuvering yourself into position to be able to place the first field token is a high priority, but farm placement is key in order to capitalise on this advantage.

Simple, but not brain dead. All in all, a very satisfying little filler for 2.

Unique, but feels similar to – 4 Gods, Kingdomino, Kingdom Builder, Micropul and Carcassonne the Castle if you need the itch scratched :)

(2 players) Great little game.  I hate Through the Desert but am quite fond of this one (go figure).  Maybe it's because the tile-laying part of the game is a precursor to the camel...er...field laying part.

There is a bit of luck in the tile draw but if you play it properly (over three rounds) then the luck is mitigated.

Downgraded: I guess I'm not a fan of placement games.

We only had time for 1 round, so my rating is subject to change, but I'm puzzled why this game was called Fjorde, when clearly you make an island or at least a peninsula. It's okay, but nothing really new or exciting here. Carcassonne Lite, if that is possible. *** Played again, a full game, still didn't like it. It feels too much like you're just trying to block each other. Maybe smaller tiles and a bigger map would be better. Don't like this much.

This is really 2 games in one.  The exploration part borrows some elements from Hellas an earlier design from the same author.  Both players actually build a play area which looks really cool.  This is intriguing as you kind of get caught up in the aesthetics of the exercice; the fjord really looks good!  Then the contest switches into an area control contest which takes a few minutes to complete.  Nice end of evening filler.

This is a very nice light 2-player tile-laying game that's a bit of a cross between Carcassonne and Hey! That's My Fish.  It's all about placing tiles and your 4 farm tokens on tiles that will allow you to claim the most pastureland spaces with your round field tokens in lines eminating from your farms - before you're cut off by the other player.

No jogo, nos somos clãs de fazendeiros nórdicos entre os séculos 8 e 11. Devemos construir fazendas, estrategicamente posicionadas, e explorar as terras vizinhas cultivando nossos campos. O jogo é dividido em três turnos e cada turno é dividido em duas partes. Primeiramente, colocamos alternadamente os ladrilhos hexagonais (tiles) de forma que encaixem corretamente com os que já estão em jogo para formar o tabuleiro. E se desejarmos podemos colocar uma fazenda no hexágono colocado. Cada jogador tem apenas 4 peças de fazenda portanto é importante escolher bons locais para colocá-las. Posteriormente, depois que os ladrilhos acabarem começa a fase de expandir as fazendas colocando os campos. Então, a partir de suas fazendas e alternadamente, devemos colocar nossos campos de modo a ocupar o maior número possível de hexágonos. Anota-se a pontuação de cada jogador e inicia-se outro turno. Ao final do terceiro turno quem conseguiu mais campos durante o jogo vence. Nessa segunda fase do turno acaba ocorrendo, com antecipações e bloqueios, uma briga por controle de área bem divertida e interessante. O registro da pontuação, ao final de cada turno, é interessante pois desperta a atenção quanto a pontuação corrente.  Adorei o jogo. O visual, muito bonito, lembra o Taluva. Arriscaria dizer que, em dois jogadores, é um melhor que o Carcassonne devido a disputa e controle de área. Comporta apenas dois jogadores mas é possível juntar duas unidades do jogo, pelo preço é algo a se pensar, e jogar em quatro pessoas com a mesma simplicidade e diversão.

Egy játék után, még nem merek végeleges véleményt írni, szóval ez még alakulhat. 
Nagyon gyors kétszemélyes játék, amiben egy fjordot "építgetünk", majd lakunk be. A játék első fele a lapkalerakásról szól. Engem itt ért az egyetlen csalódás, ugyanis általában nincs sok opciód egy lapka lerakásánál, mivel jó, ha két-három helyre le tudod tenni az aktuálisat. Gyakran egyáltalán nem lehet letenni, vagy egyetlen helyre illeszkedik csak. A lapkákra tehetünk egyet a négy házikónk közül, ha akarunk.
A játék második felében a házikóktól indulva foglaljuk el a területeket. Aki többet tud foglalni, az nyer. Illetve három ilyen etapot javasol a játék, ami persze idő függvényében szabadon variálható.
Elég sakkszerű, agyalós játék. Nem tűnik rossznak, majd még tesztelgetjük.

u.i.: Az alkatrészek meglepően aprócskák, ami nem baj, mert így utazásokra könnyen elhutcolható. :)
-----------
Annyira nem vált be hosszú távon. Nagyon korlátosan rakhatóak csak le a lapkák, így nincs igazán döntési helyzet, azzal telik a játék, hogy megtaláld, hogy mi az az egy-két hely, ahová le tudod tenni az aktuális lapkádat. Egy cuki kis kirakós, némi versengéssel.

RATING: 7
A quick game combining Carcassonne-like game board building and an end game land grab.  It's small enough to carry around for opportune game playing moments and easy enough to teach in a minute.  Additional tiles exist online to expand the game.

My typical game consists of a double set of standard Fjords tiles along with a double set of the Water Expansion tiles (developed by another Fjords fan and posted over at BoardGameGeek.com).  

Fjords follows the same Carcassonne-like idea of building the board during gameplay, thus ensuring that each game is going to be different.

RATING: 6
Fjords is a two-player tile-laying game with very light rules. The placement of farms is key to the game because they form the starting points for the land grab that takes place after the landscape has been discovered. Placing the farms where they are most beneficial is not a simple task because the tile draws can both strengthen and invalidate a position easily.

In short, Fjorde is heavily tactical with a healthy dose of uncertainty. The quite cerebral discovery mechanism and the associated placement of farms is somewhat at odds with the strong influence of the tile draws. A single round is fairly short, however, so you can always add another. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Awful, nitty-gritty, fiddly game that is much too long for what it wants to be.
Although the most time is consumed by putting a tile here and there to see, if it fits, as more often then not it's a question of a few centimetres that define if you can place a tile or not.
And then you have to go through his ordeal again and again, as you repeat the same shenanigans 3 times.
Also I still wonder about the name, because this game is about the land you build and not he water.

Fjords is a very fun game that mixes aspects of Carcassonne with Go. During a turn platers draw a tiles, connected it (or not) to the expanding map, and optionally place a house. Once the map is complete, players then take turns connecting farms to their houses in an attempt to gain control over portions of the map. When I think of the term "super-filler," Fjords is the game that jumps to mind.

Enjoyed it quite a bit, but I think 3 rounds is too much. The game simply doesn't play so differently each round to warrant that many repeats. I get why 3 rounds is used to determine best out of 2 in case of ties, but really there isn't a great amount of thinking behind the tile placing portion of the game. Thus, I might limit this game to 2 rounds per game and let ties be just that. Length aside, this is a nice, small game to pull out every now and then. Still I think I'm gonna put this in the trade pile. There's just too many better 2-player fillers and tile laying games to keep this around. The fact that the first half of the game is a pretty random "where will this fit?" exercise rather than any meaningful thought leaves 50% of the game feeling dull. The claiming part is tense but wholly informed by the dull part. I guess there's too many other games I'd pull out.

Like other reviewers, I hope to eventually increase my rating upon additional plays.  But after 6 plays, the luck of drawing a good, even playable tile (first phase), seems to have too much bearing on the second phase (laying farm plots for eventual scoring) of the game.  Potentially too many tiles with sea shore do not get used each round, which impacts when and where you may place your farms (vital for scoring).

i have only played this game twice. the first time with a double set. i liked it much more the second time with a single set of tiles. i am not a carcassonne fan, but i did enjoy this game. might be that tile laying is very limited, i have not decided yet if it is so limited i would rather not play again. it is important to force the other player into a move and be on the offensive at all times in the second phase. but then again, there is a limited number of moves one can make. perhaps the game would improve by being able to place two fields at a time, or have the option to do so once during the second phase.
even being critical i still like the game a lot.

This is one well designed "small" game. At one level it's a matter of anticipating what tiles will be available for expanding the map in a way that's favorable to you. At another level it is a mix between Carcassone and Go, with the first phase of Fjords being analogous to C and Go, and the second being more clearly Go-like.

I haven't tried it, but would guess that this game could function as a first stepping stone to teaching someone Go, because the territory analysis is more clear.

The one thing I don't like is the limited tile set. There are some combinations that just will never be possible. And, once you know the tile mix, it is easier to predict whether expanding the land in a certain way is advisable or not even possible. One outcome of this is that I am looking for a second copy. Another is that I want to make a few differently configured tiles. But no time for that at present...

Elegant and challenging, even the best strategy can be undermined by not drawing the right tiles.  Almost two games, the tile drawing farm placement is the prelude to the show of placing your fields.  Portable, enjoyable and who can argue with the fact that it's so fun to say Fjords!

My copy came poorly scored, so hard to punch out with out damage. Also, the starting pieces were misprinted. Tried to put this aside as I was playing the game. Not sure if I was able to be totally fair. But the game seemed to be much "smaller" than I had expected. Compared to other tile placement types like say Carc or Gheos. Didn't like the fact that even the designers seem to realize the game is small, suggesting that you play three times to get a final score! Will have to try again.

Update: tried it again, still get a pretty big "meh" feeling about it.

OK 2-player tile-placing game that is seperated into 2 phases (games). While the first phase is a very simple tile (and hut) placing game, the second phase plays more like an classic abstract game.

Nothing great, but a solid 2-player game.

Very fast, fun game.  The player laying the first influence token has a bit of an advantage though.  Maybe the other player should get the next 2 placements and then go as normal.

While I recognize that this is some folks go-to 2 player game (to the point where they have bought two copies), this game simply did not click for me.

A fun, light tile-laying game for two.  Players pick a tile and place it if possible, deciding whether to also place one of their four precious farms onto the tile just played.  Place your farms too early, and your opponent can hem you in.  Place them too late, and legal tile placements may constrain you to poor locations.  If a tile can't be placed, it can be temporarily set aside and a new one chosen - unless your opponent points out a legal placement.  It's always fun to point out a legal placement that forces your opponent to help you out!  Once all tiles are placed, players alternate claiming tiles with fields, attempting to cut each other off from accessing sections of tiles - the player with more fields on the board (after 3 rounds) wins. Very simple to learn, fast to play, yet with a strategic decision on nearly every turn.

Game is simple, rules are easy but it it very light and a bit lacking. I atleast enjoyed the tile laying and the strategy in placing your farms.  The second half of the round is pretty quick though, you block the opponent from areas you can claim completely, then you take turns filling in the spaces that are in shared territory.  Pretty light and quite simple.  The fjords weren't a big enough part of the gameplay to me.

This one went on a little too long for my tastes.  I liked the part of the game in the end, but the beginning (laying out the tiles) was a bit tiresome.  Plus, when you add in the rule about you can trick your opponent by lying about the tile being placeable, I found the game less interesting.  I don't want playing cop to be a necessary game mechanic!

I discovered Fjords at a tiny local game store, and it's a neat little area-control game, which has a beautiful aesthetic. It can be a little straightforward in 2p (which is how it comes in the box), and a little short for my liking, so I bought a second copy, sprayed the player pieces different colours, and merged the tiles. Now, it goes up to four players, and lasts a little longer, which I greatly prefer. Would be lower rated without this homemade addition.

First played this on Jan 23, 2007.  This is a good filler game.  Being tile based it is a cross between Carcassonne (lay tiles and place farm house buildings) and Though the desert (place claims next to buildings).  Object is to place more claims than your opponent and you win.  With the simple rules it's worth a play or two every now and then.

Fjords is pretty much Carcassonne meets Go.  The tile placing can be a little bit too restrictive and the second phase Go aspect, too lacking in interaction, but I think there's a lot of momentum here to make a good game.  With a few more playings, I think I'll start to get the hang of how to make the system play well enough to really shine.  The theme really stinks though.  Tactical feudal Norse farming?!  Are you serious?!

RATING: 3.5
Very interesting.  Carcassonne meets Go.  It does have enough of a flavor of it's own to keep around though.

The landscape created actually does have the feel of a Nordic fjord, which is a testament to the designer. (May he rest in peace.)

I was worried there would be no choices in the second phase, but I think there are just enough for the length of time it takes.  There's generally room for one or two killer moves in the farming phase.

The only frustrating part is the pure number of tiles that you are unable to place.  It almost feels like a puzzle piece that you just can't line up.

Apr08: I think in the end, it just doesn't have enough interesting decisions.  I'm pretty convinced that the only thing that really matters is your hut placement.  Since you only get to place 4 huts, that's about 4 interesting decisions in 15 minutes.  Yea, the rest of the game is cool, but the placement of tiles and fields doesn't really make you strain your brain.

A little lighter than I hoped, you lose some control due to tiles that HAVE to be placed and the restrictions on placing them in general. Carc and TTD mixed is a relevant statement but I certainly like TTD more as there is more going on. A little strategy in the farm placement and the tile placement and it does plays quick but not enough substance to keep me or the wife interested. Not too bad little area influence (trying to gobble up as much land as you can)/tile placement game for 2 players.  

Update: 6 => 5 Played starting with 3 tiles face up and always 3 face up all the time that you can choose from ala El Cab and this was a little better giving you a choice and a little more control but the game still lacks any real depth

=> TRADED

The second half is sort of 'go lite.' The first half has some mildly interesting placement aspects and /very/ interesting decisions as to when to place your farms. (I may change my mind about how interesting farm placement is after more plays. At that point my rating would probably drop to a five.)

My big disappointment with most tile-laying games is that the resulting arrangement of tiles is artificial and contrived.

Fjords is a pure abstract game with a Carcassonne-like "map" and a few "houses." No theme at all here. You draw tiles one at a time to build up a map in the first phase of the game. Occasionally you might want to place a house on the tile you draw. Once the map is finished, your houses become the jumping-off points for claiming tiles one at a time.

Rinse and repeat twice more... although to me that feels like playing the game three times in a row. Works fine for what it is. Not something I can see myself seeking out in the future. My rating for this would be at least a point higher if it were presented as a pure abstract.

First impression: this is Carcassone revamped. But this plays more abstract and it feels not as elegant in the exploring phase because tiles often can't be placed.

For me, this alone is a reason to play again.

An interesting little blend of Carcassonne and Go. The area grab in the second phase is what elevates this game for me. When to place your villages in the tile placement phase is the decision point, and challenges my ability to speculate on what will happen in the land grab. Strong luck element in the tile draws. Visually appealing. Very solid little 2-player game.

I'm going to chalk this one up to inexperience, but there didn't seem to be too much tension in the game.  It also went a little slower than I would have liked, probably due to our unfamiliarity with the tiles and trying to place them in different places unsuccessfully.  I can see a moderately interesting game in here, but I think I am just not that big of a fan of games where you have to repeat the same process multiple times (like in race games).  If one round isn't enough, is there too much luck involved that it takes multiple rounds to even it out?

If through the desert becomes a favourite this one will probably also rate high.(TTD is a favourite)

First testrun was not so good. 
The exploration stage was not engaging in my solo testrun. And seemed more like a puzzle than a game. I believe however that the placing of the farms  and tiles to your advantage can be fun.
Claiming reminded me of Hey that's my fish.
Frankly I would rather play that, Through the desert or carcassonne.

I have read the rules a couple of times now. I must be missing something. I will have give this to a friend and ask him to teach me this little game. Because to me that is what it is right now a little game :( .

RATING: 2
I bought this game on spec after looking at the very positive reviews here on the geek. Having played it, I'm not sure I understand what anyone sees in it. The placing of tiles is VERY limited, as there is generally only one space or two that they will fit. The other aspect of this exploration phase, placing your houses, is sort of a crapshoot, because you don't really have much clue (or say) in how the island will develop. The Through-the-Desert-ish second phase is even more boring than the first. There's no room for any type of clever play. It takes only a few seconds to equate what your best moves are; Two intelligent players looking at the play area for a minute or so could likely come to a concensus as to how this phase would ultimately play out.

What a fantastic tile placement/area control game for 2 players.  Deciding the best locations for your farms during the discovery phase is critical to success when claiming fields in the second phase of the game.  It reminds me of a cross between Carcassonne and Through the Dessert.  Fjords is easy to teach, has small table space requirements, and great artwork.  This game is a keeper in my collection.

RATING: 5
Very abstract game and doesn't impress me much: A quite much of luck, because you just pick up blindly all the board pieces - but that's just good thing - unfortunately there is a very little game included: normally you have one-to-three places where you can put your tile, then should you put your house on it or not?

This game just gets on my nerves.  The tile laying part is kind of fun, but the part where you each try to quickly claim all the farmland just makes me MAD.  I guess I just don't like confrontation and especially not area control, at least in this game. It doesn't have the depth at all of a game like Through the Desert, it's just a quick claim your spots for a few minutes. NOOOOO don't take my farm, my home, my lovely home, you claim jumper!!  Bad things happen when we play this game.

[b]Simple, quick playing Viking themed tile placement and area control game.[/b]
r{[i]An enjoyable and underrated two player abstract.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Two players alternate joining hexagonal landscape tiles to discover a region of fjords containing meandering farmland between mountain and sea while also strategically placing up to four farms throughout the region. After discovery is complete, players then alternate placing fields onto empty farmland spaces adjacent to their previously placed farms or newly placed fields with the goal of claiming the most area to win.

COMMENTS
There's a relaxing quality to the creation of the fjords at the beginning of the game before it shifts into an optimization puzzle to solve at its end with the fields. Playing three rounds towards a cumulative score as the rules suggest proves to be the best experience, though even playing a single round when short on time is enjoyable.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ The "board" is created anew each game with tiles drawn randomly.
+ Player agency drives the design of the landscape.
- Lots of uncertainty for placing farms early while little of the landscape is revealed.
+/- Discovery of the region's landscape can take unexpected turns which may help or hinder.
* Long out of print and hard to find nowadays.

This rapidly became a favorite 2-player game for me and the missus. I like the two different stages to the game, and the different kinds of strategies involved. Also, it plays pretty quickly and in a limited space, so a quick pick-up game isn't out of the question.

I bought this game one day i was just after buying a game and didn't have any clue what. Being a norwegian, I noticed it for the name. After the initial explanation from the shop owner I went home to rethink. At home I checked some reviews and decided it sounded pretty ok, so I went back downtown to buy it. Turned out to be an excellent buy, and i've had a lot of fun with it. The biggest minus is actually the fact that it can only be played with 2 players, I would like to play it with more people some time.. The thinking ahead sometimes turns on you at the last minute, which is also fun.

I don't know why I expected so much more from this game, but I did.  It's got the draw a tile, lay a tile of Carcassone, but feels like you have even less meaningful choices, if that's possible.  I don't particularly care for the play-the-same-game-multiple-times-to-play-just-once mechanic, either.  All that said, it's not a bad game, but certainly not a stand out.

Played several times.

Interesting amalgamation of abstract area control and tile-laying mechanics.  Encourages fast play.  Would appreciate if it came with pieces sufficient for more players, but as a 2-player game, excels.  Abstract area control is mini game of Go.

Would be interested in playing again.  No chance of future acquisition, given other good 2-player area control titles since.

2p, 30m.  I bought this for my 6-year-old nephew for Christmas 2005 at Game Arena, Cerritos, CA [now defunct].  It looked so cool, that I eventually traded for another copy myself. Ever-changing board makes intriguing landscapes.  Light strategic decisions are influenced by the terrain placement. This is from the same designer that did "Hellas" which is a very similar 2-player hex-tile-laying game, but Hellas has combat.

Traded away Fjords for Tongiaki in March 2007.

Interessant joc d'en Franz-Benno Delonge (el mateix autor de TransEuropa i TransAmerica) per a dues persones.

Es desenvolupa en 3 rondes de 2 fases cadascuna d'aquestes:

- La primera és la CONSTRUCCIÓ del fiord (es fa per torns entre tots 2 jugadors seguint unes regles) i COL·LOCACIÓ de les 4 granjes de cada jugador.

- La segona és la PRESA DE POSSESSIÓ de camps (començant pels adjacents a les granjes col·locades durant la primera fase).

Cada camp és un punt de victoria, al final de les 3 rondes es sumen tots els punts i guanya qui més suma.

EN RESUM: Un bon abstracte on és més important l'estratègia de la primera fase (tant en la construcció del fiord com en la col·locació de granjes) que en la fase de possessió de camps (que també en té, però depèn molt del que hagis fet abans).

This is a wonderful two-player tile laying game with a twist. Being Norwegian myself, and living on the west coast rimming with the infamous fjords, I appreciate the setting of the game, but more so I appreciate its take on tile laying. You are using hexagonal tiles to build up a common landscape, trying to determine when to place one of your few farms down. You won't know until the second half if your choice was a good one or not, as in that half you are vying to control the biggest portion of the landscape.

The game is simple and elegant, and manages to really engage me at the same time. Very happy to have hunted this game down and look forward to playing it again.

Outstanding. Criminally underappreciated, largely because of the superficial (and, more to the point, wrong) Carcassonne comparisons. Has more in common with [gameid=503]. The land-grab phase is especially mathematical; as a game of perfect information, (similar to Domineering or "[gameid=7450]" as listed on the geek) it is subject to analysis. But I like analysis!

The aim of the tile-laying phase, it should be pointed out, is not to make a pretty picture. It's to set yourself up for success in the land-grab phase. They're connected, and understanding the significance of the set-aside tiles is critical. Every time I play, I am more amazed by the interaction between the two phases; there are many layers.

RATING: 5.2
Fjords is an abstract two player game that is divided into two distinct phases.

The basic idea is that each player draws and places a hex tile according to the geographical features it contains and may then place one of their three settlements on the tile they place down. Once all tiles are down (or no more can be placed) then each player takes turns to claim a hex next to a settlement or already claimed hex. The thing here is to try to cut off the other player's access to hexes. Once every hex is claimed add up the number of hexes each player has and the one with the most wins.

This has had a few plays already and seems to be more popular with my regular opponents than myself. Not to say I hate it, but it just seems after my few plays that managing circumstances so that you're first to place in the second phase has a disproportionate amount of importance in determining the winner. 

I could be being unfair here and will not refuse a game so perhaps with a bit more experience I’ll discover ways to mitigate against this. My regular opponent advises that going first is only so very important if you’ve made a dog’s breakfast of your initial placements; alas, that is pretty much my strategy. 

Overall, one worth considering if you’re an abstract fan.

picked up in November 2005: Another game to try and draw my wife in.  She hasn't beat me at it yet, but seems to like it just a bit less than Carcassonne.  I personally think it's a fantastic 2-player game.  Great game to introduce euro style games.

I've only played this once, but I liked what I played, and I think it a veritable Carcassone-killer.  It has tile-laying and meeple-placing, but to more of a point in Fjords.  Obviously, I enjoy the light wargame/Go part of it as well.

RATING: 6
Only one play and it was kind of "meh" for me. The tile placement seemed very constricting with little or no choices. The second part of the game seemed to favor the starting player exclusively. There's enough strategy that if you aren't that smart you will probably lose but with two evenly matched opponents it just comes down to luck of the draw.

RATING: 4
I love the theme and graphic design of this game;  it's nice to see Scandinavia represented through something other than bloodthirsty Viking hordes.  Alas, that just makes it more disappointing that the game itself is so weak;  tiles that don't fit anywhere can get drawn with disturbing frequency, and you can sometimes tell who's going to win the round before the field-placing process is complete.  Also, thumbs down for the re-used tile placement rules from the designer's previous game, Hellas.

I like the construction aspect and the placement of the "huts", but then I simply  couldn't nail down the Go-like second half.  It's alright and I'd give it another whirl, but nothing great.

Feels a little too limited. Maybe that's supposed to be 'part of the game', but that doesn't sit right with me. Part of the problem is that every game I have played seems to have been a blowout for one side or the other. Maybe more plays would reveal more strategy, but the folks I play with are probably going to suggest other games.

I think this game actually deserves better than the "7" rating I've given it.  However, I'm trying to use the BGG rating system which I believe punishes games on either end of the weight spectrum.  I'm more likely to say that I will, "never turn down a game", if that game's weight and length fit my personal preferences.  For a lighter, two-player, tile laying game, this one is really, really great.  It is tight from beginning to end.  You can learn the rules in a few minutes and spend the rest of the time agonizing over placement decisions.  For a nice, light game that I can play with my wife in half an hour or less, this game is a real winner.

Don't play the three rounds recommended by the rules. It's a nice little Carcassonne clone and perfectly inoffensive, but for something so apparently simple, a game does seem to take way too long. Those without geometrically-inclined thought processes tend to get very annoyed by this game, to the hearty amusement of the rest of us.

RATING: 7.5
An excellent, quick, two player game. Quite well balanced. I can see "the love" fading slightly over time, but Fjords is a keeper. Very likely I will get a second set and add them  together. Recommended as a faster, leaner alternative to Carc'.

NB: I bought a second copy and combined them. Now we play one iteration of the combined game, rather than playing three times in a row. Recommended for people who like the game.

RATING: 7
Solid spatial awareness game. I thought this was a neat little 2 player game of two halves - the first of which is a tile laying game that reminded me of the farms in carcassonne as you try to increase the size of your fields and block your opponents in. The second part reminded me a little of Hey Thats my Fish! You expand your own area majority while at the same time try to block off the high scoring groups from your opponent.

I've read a lot of varying opinions about this game. I love it: I feel the designer's purpose was to provide the number of pieces the game has, as well as to provide the number of strategic choices that the tile-playing makes available. 

In particular, as suggested, play three games as a set, because the tile-laying takes quite a bit of time, and to play 3 games straight takes some concentration. Also, playing 3 games will help balance out the ebb and flow of scoring should one or the other player miscalculate moves or have bad luck in one particular game. 

Some people have complained about not being able to play tiles, but in the first several games I've played, I or my opponents have been able to play all but about 0-3 tiles (of 40) each time. The first half of each (of a set of three games) contest takes time as players try to decide what kind of tile (water, land, mountain, or usually mixed among the three types) where, so that when the second (scoring) half of the arises, players can place pieces adjacent to four previously placed farmhouses in such a way as to cut off their opponent in a mutual land grab. Only these pieces, not the farmhouses, count in scoring. 

Not sure why, but "Fjords" is perhaps my favorite game to play in a park on a warm day.

50+ plays. One of my favourite 15 minute non-gamer games. (The rules say play 3 times, but we find once at a time works just fine for us.) Lovely artwork, simple rules. It's all about placement of your huts to claim territory, but you still need to get lucky with subsequent tiles to extend and create that territory. And then there's a nice denouement to finish the game staking our your claims. Experience is a big plus, but sometimes not enough, striking the right balance for this niche.

If Carcassonne and Hey That's My Fish had a baby, the mechanisms of that game might feels like Fjords. 

This is a Good Light-Medium 30-minute 2-Player hex tile game. Plays in 3 rounds, each round has phase of tile laying with farms, followed by a phase a field placing, then scoring. Artwork is similar to Carcassonne which is a style I like. Since this really fell into our household's "Abstract Games" categories, we decided to Jones Theory this out.

Casual Game! Beer-N-Pretzels (2-Player) Game!

"Carcassonne" meets "Through the Desert."  In the first phase you lay the abstract terrain tiles just like Carcassonne, then in the second phase you place circular wood bits on the tiles to push your boundaries to the max like Through the Desert. This game has absolutely nothing to do with fjords or the vikings (how can they even say as much??)  But, if you like Carcassonne and abstracts you may like this.

Not a bad little game, but came out when tile-laying had been done like mad by Carcassonne.  The claiming part gives it a bit of zest, but ultimately this one will probably have the role of something-to-do-before-more-than-two-people-arrive.  It's nice to have that kind of game, but there are a lot more heftier and interesting 2-players out there.

RATING: 8
Nice riff on Carc-style tile-layers.  As a tile game, the hex tiles lend it a new feel, and it is especially well-suited for 2-player play (being designed for that).  But, as a tile game, it also owes a bit too much to Carc; it's essentially hex-Carc reduced to fields.  Still, a pleasant change for those who love tile games.

Lots of tactics packed into a very short amount of time.  The first "half" of the game is basically Carcassone - you use tiles to build your own custom Go board.  Then once the tiles are used, you play a typical game of Go, using the custom board you just created.  

We finished the game in 20 minutes, but I forsee analysis paralysis players taking double the time.  I think Go players will enjoy this, although Go "purists" may not.  But even though it's a lot like Carcassone, I don't think your girlfriend/family/younger Carcassone-fans will like this too much.

The love child of Carcassonne and Go.

Very simple to teach and play. Plays quickly, a nice 2 player filler while waiting for other games.

The first phase discovery and tile play is visual and is where you set up for the second phase. Very go like as you try to isolate tiles and vie for contested areas first. 

Yes there is a lot of luck from the tile draw, but also a surprising bit of skill to manage your position

very nice little tile-laying game. sort of like the bastard child of through the desert and carcassonne. the tile-laying rules seem overly restrictive at first, but after a few plays you see that there is room for some clever play and the board always ends up looking different each game. the through the desert like land grab during the second part of the game makes for some nice agonizing decisions. it's nice to have some quality filler that isn't a card game. i never play the suggested best out of three rounds. i think to be enjoyed, the game needs to be approached as a quick and light filler.

Pretty nice two player game. The action is pretty fluid and there's no pausing except to wonder where to play a tile. Sometimes the end game is already decided by the tile laying and then the actual field placement can become a chore, but I'd expected it to be quite rare.

I see that Fjords is a great two player game.  I'd certainly prefer to play it over Carcassonne.  I like that the tiles are hexes which makes the tile laying part more interesting than typical square tiles.  I like the staking your claim aspect of placing farms.  Fjords is deeper than Carcassonne (in my opinion) and easier to explain and understand.

I don't think it will ever rate higher than this because I'm so terrible at it.  I get frustrated when I do something obviously stupid and end up losing the game.  This happens every time I play this game.

Much better than I'd expected after reading the rules. Unfortunately the first half of the game can play itself about half the time when you pick up a tile and it has only one space you can place it. This seems to happen over and over, the end result being that you are forced to place tiles in a place that might be beneficial to your opponent. Like most tile laying games it seems this could benefit from having a small pool of open tiles from which to draw from, but then that'll just slow down the game. Spending most of your turn just looking for spaces the tile would fit reminds me of the same frustration I had with Aloha. The game is a quick one though and therefore not too painful.

Melissa and I played her new copy of Fjords last night.  Its a nice, short game with some nice looking tiles, some interesting game play choices, and some good ole' fashionedcompetition between spouses.  We ended up in a tie (41 points each) after the prescribed 3 rounds, which was a good way to end the evening.

Like a hybrid of Carcassonne and Hey! That's My Fish! That is a GREAT formula for a 2-player game! However, the game seemed to lack tension the last time I played it, and the area-enclosure phase of the game is nearly automatic. I want to try and hook non-gamers with this though.

Usually not one to cling heavily onto a game's theme- but supposedly the theme is about Viking clans and Norway's coast...yada-yada-yada. The theme could really be anything to this tile-laying/area control game. It's simple to play and score but the minutia of making sure the edges of certain landscaping elements line up exactly slow the game down for me. Maybe with more plays the tiles would "click" for me, but it feels like I am putting a puzzle together.

Most of the fun in this game is simply to see how it plays out.  The luck of the draw plays *heavily* on how you actually do:  there is rarely much choice in where you place your tile.  Farm placements do provide crucial difficult choices, but once again you could be screwed by bad tile draws.  Maybe it will seem less random once I get to know the tiles better.  Anyway, it IS very cool to see how it plays out and it's nice and quick.

Lapkalerakós, területfoglalós játék, de sajnos azok közül a gyengébb eresztés. A játék két részből áll, először Carcassone szerűen lapkákat rakunk le, amelyeken mező, hegy és víz található. Ezek csak meghatározott módon értintkezhetnek. Eldönthetjük minden lapka lerakásakor, hogy a 4 házunk közül az egyiket rárakjuk-e. Ha minden lapka lekerült, akkor a második részben korongjainkat rakhatjuk le felváltva érintkezve egymással a házainktól kezdve. Aki többet le tud tenni az nyeri az első fordulót. 3 ilyen forduló után a több pontot szerzett játékos nyer. Nem lenne semmi gond a játékkal, de egyrészt elég nehezen látható melyik lap hova illik, sokat kell próbálgatni, illetve a játék másik része már csak sima egyértelmű korongrakás. Tehát az első részben dől el minden, itt pedig a szerencse erősen bejátszik. Nem katasztrófa a kétszemélyesek közül, de semmi extrát nem tud felmutatni és sokkal érdekesebbek vannak nála.

I'm not sure if Hans Im Gluck has put out a small box game before, but they somehow made a great game that fit in the same clunky box that Days of Wonder uses.  Regardless, I really like this.  It is a nice filler game that gets your juices up for something meatier.  I'm not sure if I want to play it three times in a row (like the game suggests), but once is quite a joy.  The comparisons to Carcassonne are insubstantiated outside of the tile laying.  The pieces that you are setting up are points of position to actively expand from later in the game.  In Carcassonne you are placing static inactive pieces that score when you close them off.  Timing is everything in this game, playing the odds of the tiles to decide when and where you are going to place pieces, preparing yourself for the land grab.  There is that question of pushing the end of the placement by burning though the tiles while you have a better position or using up the face up tiles to give yourself more land (that your opponent might take advantage of.  Plus, when do you want to exhaust all your huts, it is good to hold off, but you don't want to be left with huts in hand or stuck on the outskirts.  I think this is as good as the best two player Kosmos games.

Fun two-player that plays quickly. I'm unsure of the tile distribution though. It seems like a lot are immediately unplayable, and maybe that's part of the latter mid-game strategy, but it feels a little unsatisfying. However, it plays so quickly that it's not a big deal. We play only one round to keep it as a filler.EDIT: It turns out the unplayable tiles are a big deal to me and it's now up for trade.

1 play, 1 round only

A tile-laying area control game for two. You have the luck-of-the-draw that you do in Carcassonne, except that you may also have face up tiles from which to choose. The main decision points seem to be:
- where to place the tile; often, there are only a few (or one!) option so not a lot of choice here, necessarily
- whether or not to play your farmhouse; that's the key issue since it will set up your offense in the land grab phase
- the order in which to grab contested areas; seems like this is mostly going to depend on who goes first ... not sure there's a lot of decisions here, actually

Vaguely interesting, I guess, but we just didn't find the game all that much fun. Certainly not enough to play it 3 times!

--- Summary ---
Set the 3 starting tiles on the table, and mix the rest face down. Each player gets 4 farms and 20 discs. Random start player.

3 Rounds, each with 2 Phases: Discovery, then Land Claim.

DISCOVERY PHASE
On your turn, either
- draw a tile from the face down stacks and add it to the play area; if unable to do so (and opponent doesn't opt to show you a legal play), set it aside face up and go again
OR
- take a tile from the face up ones and play it.
Note: tiles must be placed adjacent to 2 or more other tiles, and such that the terrain types on the edges match those on adjacent tiles.

Then, _may_ place one of your unused farms onto the farmland (green) on the tile you just played.
Note: may never play a tile that creates 2 land masses separated by water (i.e., only 1 land mass in game, composed of farmland and mountains)

The Phase ends when the last tile is drawn from the face down stacks. If the player who drew the last tile from the face down stacks plays it, the opponent goes first in the Land Claim Phase. Otherwise, the drawing player plays first.

LAND CLAIM PHASE
Alternately place a disc on the farmland space of a tile adjacent to either your farmhouse or your previously placed disc (max 1 disc/tile). Phase ends when all claimable tiles are claimed (note: NOT intended to be piece-limited)

SCORE
Get 1VP per tile with your farmhouse or disc.

Play 3 identical rounds (mixing up tiles) and adding VP. Loser of previous round begins play. Player with most VP wins (tie breaker = most rounds won).

On new years day I played one session of Fjords. Area control, tile placement game without any theme to speak off. I liked the late part off the game with the go feeling to it but the first "draw-a-tile and place it carcasonne style" on top of that? In my mind it didn´t mix all that well.

A meeple and a penguin had a child and it was a farm with a trail of fields. The Carcassonne-like tile and hut placement somehow results in the territory claiming feelings from Hey! That's My Fish.

We'll have to give this several plays to see if there is enough luck for my wife to enjoy it. The open information quality of the hut and field placement may overwhelm the random tile draw. We'll see.

Nice quick game. In addition to being great for couples this game would be a good one for a '2-player games' game night.

[gameid=15511] is an abstract game of tile placement and area control. Each player is the head of a clan of fierce vikings fighting for control over the fertile land.

You take turns placing tiles on the board creating water, mountains and grassland. Whenever you have placed a tile you may place one of 4 farms. Once the last tile has been placed, either on the board or face-up beside it, because it cannot be placed legally, the 2nd phase begins.

In the 2nd phase players take turns extending their farmholdings, trying to secure as much of the land as possible. This is often accomplished by cutting off the opposing clan leader. Naturally farmland can only be cultivated as an extension of existing farms, therefore making it important to secure proper placement of them in the 1st phase.

Once all possible tiles have been claimed for farming the players tally their area. The game is usually played over three rounds - adding up the scores from each separate game.

It is a simple game, it takes up very little space and plays in a short amount of time. You can determine the number of rounds to play and thereby the length.

The theme could be anything, here it is vikings discovering and ultimately settling green lands. It works as a premise for the game, but at its core it is an abstract game of area control.

I have never been a fan of abstracts, nor area control games. You try to encircle your opponent, hoping to catch them off-guard. There is a bit of luck in the discovery phase, but nothing major.

It should become a game of mind, of skill - but the ultimate nail in the coffin for me is that in the end it becomes a matter of who makes the first mistake - it is rarely a matter of who pulls off a clever move the other did not see coming.

If you enjoy abstracts, I am sure you will love this one, if you are not too keen on them - stay away.

RATING: 9
Fast, cheap, and an all-around excellent little addiction of a game, and, aside from 'Container', is my favorite Delonge design.  I love how the game plays so quickly over its two phases; I love how the first phase is more strategic in nature, as the landscape is co-elaborated by the player taking turns laying tiles, and how the second phase is more tactical, involving a Go-like area-control exchange that takes place on the newly-created landscape.

Ostensibly this game is about claiming farmland by establishing, well, farms. But possibly because it involves so much head-to-head territorial conflict, I mentally treat Fjords as if it were a pocket wargame whose battlefield changes from game-to-game. And as a pseudo-wargame, I find it strangely evocative in ways that much larger and much more complex war-games often aren't.

Currently enjoy the Mega-Fjords variant more than the original.

RATING: 5
A nice inexpensive game for 2.  Its mechanics really do feel like Carcassonne and Through the Desert put into a blender, but the end result is not a mish mash of the two games.  The game is about building territories which only you can access while preventing your opponent from having territories.  This game takes the interesting parts of Keythedral and distills that into a much smaller, quicker, and more interesting game.  I like the meta game with making tiles unplayable so the player can gain the crucial first disc placement to help seal off territories.  

 I am not quite sure the best place to place my houses, and I am still hammering away at my mental checklist for spots I fit a winning position.  I do know that its crucial to save the fourth house for one of the last tiles, but its also important to have one towards the center of the map as well.  Its a nice balance.  Hopefully this one holds up over repeated plays, but I am enjoying it some right now.

I don't care for the 3 rounds.  I will compare it to the 3 rounds for Lost Cities.  In Lost Cities its possible to have an exceptional round that totally racks up the points, in Fjords those rounds are much much fewer and far between and the 3rd round frequently feels anti climactic.

Not a bad little 2 player area control game at all.  I kind of like it.  I like the two phases but picking everything up and redoing what you just did all over again multiple times seems a bit bleh.  Necessary, but bleh.  As far as 2 player games go, I'd rather play Carc The Castle, Roma, Dynasties, Aton, or Memoir '44, but it'll come out from time to time and see some plays. UPDATE, managed to trade my copy away...

After only a few plays, I must say that this was a really interesting game.  I liked how the game was split into two very different phases, the first being a tile-laying phase, somewhat like Carcassonne, where you match fields, mountains, and water as you take turns expanding the board.  The second phase reminds me of Through the Desert a little, as you try to claim as much territory as possible.  Interesting game that I'm looking forward to playing again, and that went right into my shopping cart after the first play.

RATING: 6
(2 plays) A nice little abstract, after two plays. It's not any higher because I don't see it having a lot of depth. Certainly the plays in the 2nd phase are mechanical. There's a fair bit of strategy in farm placement, I'll grant, but I'm not sure how much. If better players start beating the pants off me at this, I'll change my mind.
It winds up as a decent 2-player filler for me, but it's not something I'll seek out.

Great couples game!  A bit more of an investment in time than something like Lost Cities, but once you've got the hang of it, plays fast and fun.  I love the "Carcassonne-junior" phase followed by the "Go-light" phase for variety (although it is pretty hard to screw up that second part).  Reccomended!

A small game with small tiles and small wooden bits. Still, its flawless design shines through. Everybody can play it because of its simple rules, but besides luck you definitely also need good tactics and a good spatial overview to win. I concur with the notion that it feels a little like playing Go - including the ever present "Turn Angst". Cannot imagine easily tiring of this game.
UPDATE: The more I play, the more I love this game - and so does my girlfriend. My favourite two player "filler"!!

I played this at WBC 2005.  This is a nice little two player game.  The first building part of the game seems like Carcassonne.  You match up landscape tiles and place huts at strategic locations.  Some tiles might have to be set aside when they can't be played, but there might be chances to place them later.  Once the land has been placed, the game becomes more like Through the Dessert.  You place wooden tokens, expanding outward from your huts, trying to control as much of the board as possible.  Hut placement during the first part of the game is important, but it is hard to tell where the important choke points are going to be.  I also like the opportunity for a little bit of sneaky play as you use the previously un-placeable tiles to force the other player to place the last landscape so that you can be the first to place a token.  Its a nice combination of game play elements and makes for a nice fast game.

carcassonne's cousin, if you like one you'll probably like the other.  the tiles could have been better set up so the quirky rules restrictions didn't show up every second turn, and it seems like there should be twice the number of tiles that there are (which would offset what seems to be a distinct first-player advantage by making maneuvering more important),  but still a fun 2-player game.

currently this is my favorite two player game.  quick, elegant, simple and fun.  area control....two phases.......first you place tiles and farms, and in the second phase you lie down farm tokens until all tiles are owned ......the largest farm wins.  love it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In first phase, take turns placing a puzzle piece.  Some turns, place one of your four pawns as a bet that you can make its territory bigger.  In second phase, race one tile at a time  by placing chips to extend the territory around your pawns.  Highest claimed-tile count wins.

Luck of the draw may harm your ability to improve your position or alternatively hamper your opponent's.  Some opportunity to make skillful decions about placement of the tile you are given.

I am amused every once in a while, but not dedicated to much repetition.

Love it love it, what an awesome little filler.

I'm a sucker for any geographically-themed game that involves a randomly generated map (and ideally the chance to explore/reveal it): Fjords, Carcasonne, Hellas, Viktory II, Nexus Ops, Entdecker, Catan.... good stuff.

In the case of Fjords:  we like this little thing so much that we bought two copies, so we can combine the tiles and explore a MEGA-Fjord.  Yeah baby, yeah!

It's also super-cheap:  perfect for stocking-stuffing at the holidays.

If only the designer were still with us.  May you rest in peace, Franz-Benno Delonge.  You've made our lives richer.

It's a combination of tile placement a la carcassonne, and area control a la Go.  Unlike Carcassonne there is very little you can do to muscle in on a feature, since you only get 4 placements and they don't move. Feels very much like Go in the field placement phase.  Overall, a great 2-player tile game.

Great fast-playing and thinky two-player game with easy rules but lots of depth.  Both the tile-laying and field-placing phases work really well and complement each other nicely.  The first phase is very tactical, where the goal is to set yourself up well for the more strategic second phase.  Most of the meat is in the first phase, as the second will usually only have a few tough decisions in it.  But the second phase plays out really quickly, so this is totally fine.

Played once. An abstract tile-laying game which is played in two phases. While the first one is reminiscent of a simplified Carcassonne, the second one can be compared to Penguins. Overall, the game has nothing in it which would really entice me to play it again. A positive point, however, is that it is sold as a 2-player game only - while it might work with more, 2 players would probably be the best configuration anyway.

It is a nice and fast two player game. I like the division between two phases (exploration and field placing). Both of the are meaningful and have some interesting (but not too complex) decisions. Definitely high point on my games for two list.  

Received it as a prize in a contest in one of the Polish on-line board game shops (rebel.pl - sorry for the small advertisement but I am really happy and I think they deserve mentioning)

Update: Abstract nature slowly kills it for me.

A nice, quick playing 2 player game. The comparisons to Carcassonne really are superficial - and only applies to half the game. The tile play is a bit more restrictive than Carc, as is the strategy of city placement. Felt a bit like roping off sections of territory a la Through the Desert, which is a good thing. Several of the elements feel comfortably familiar, but the game is fast paced and offers enough nuance and strategic decisions to stand on its own.

The two phases setup is an interesting one.  However, it seems that all of the strategy lies within the first half with the second part of placing the plantations being fairly obvious and straightforward.  I don't really care for the tile design, as well as how restrictive they are and how often they have to be set aside simply because the terrains do not fit with anything currently played.  I also did not like the fact that most of phase one is simply a jockey for the right to play first for the next part since there is a huge advantage being in that position.  Not recommended.

Nice attempt at using a theme, but what's here is a two-part abstract that's engrossing and fun.  First part is actually building the board; you have a few decisions to make (not a lot, but a few) and second part is actually claiming those lands.  The second part is the more interesting of the two; very Go-like, which I enjoy.

A fairly straightforward set collection game.  There seem to be some balance issues, particularly with the bonus cards.  The player with the most trade goods seems to win every game.  However, it is reasonably fun and plays in less than an hour, both good things.

Alright area majority style game with some interesting twists in scoring. Running around to certain buildings is the flow and theme. It's a bit like China with some complications - you 'bid' on the pair of cards to take which makes for nasty situations. Seems clear if you don't get a key, you won't get to the high scoring areas. 4-player game quite contentious.

Schacht does it again!  Like he did with [b]Valdora[/b] he takes a tired genre and reinvents it with a rapid, tight system.  This one is based largely on [b]Web of Power[/b].  It is a pleasure to play.  Short turn order and fun.

The game has a simple concept, place businesses around the island.  The problem is you must have a continuous road of uninterrupted businesses along a road and that gets tricky.  A unique system of bonuses that only goes to the player who holds the bonus card, along with the individual scoring cards per turn adds to the strategy.

I am not a fan of route-building games, but I love this one! There is always a plethora of painful choices to be made, and there is much player-interaction. Unlike so many other route-building games, if someone takes the spot/cards/whatever that you wanted, rather than weeping and gnashing your teeth, there are usually other ways to achieve your goal. Thus, I would say it's more tactical than strategic; but a flexible strategy, nevertheless, is required. 
The components are good-looking, but the art could be clearer as to what is actually being portrayed.  Confusion can result from this lack of clarity. The rules, too, while simple, are not at all clear upon first reading. 
Then there's the theme. This is one of the most poorly themed game I have EVER played! If it actually had a theme, ANY theme, my rating would be somewhere between a 9 and a 10. The themeing becomes quite laughable with the money....no, it's not money, even though it looks like paper money: it's "letters of business". Alright, the "letters of business" are laughable...since anyone else would call them Victory Points! And why these paper VP? Couldn't we have a small scoring track somewhere?
So if you're looking for one of the most well-balanced games out there, you'll want to play The Golden City. If you're looking for a game that has a theme, even a theme applied to the game with just a drop of glue, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. Nevertheless, it remains a highly entertaining and mechanically satisfying game!

With every Michael Schacht game I've ever played, my reaction after reading the rules has been "Is that all there is?"  In his better designs Schacht takes very simple elements and creates a game that is much more interesting than the sum of its parts.  Die Goldene Stadt is one of his better ones. 

It is reminiscent of Kardinal und Konig/Web of Power in that pieces are placed on the board by playing cards of the relevant land and in the multiple ways of scoring that present alternative strategies and fine judgments. However, in other respects Goldene Stadt feels a quite different game.

Why this game took so long to come to the English world is a mystery.  Its highly playable, language neutral out of the box and a real pleasure to play.  Easily should have made the SdJ recommended list and likely the DSP top 10.  Game play is a mix of card drafting and area control (via a point to point movement approach).  Add to that a set collection mechanism for scoring and all the components for a great super filler / light main game are there for the picking.  One of Schacht's great titles.

Kevesebbre számítottam, szóval kellemes csalódás. Családi játéknak nem is rossz! Máskor is játszom vele szívesen, bár kedvenc azért nem lesz. Minden szerezhető dologgal kapcsolatosan (különféle kártyák/pénz) kínálkozik önálló stratégia, talán a pénzes bónusz tűnik a többinél erősebbnek, és ami biztos, hogy a 10 pontos bónuszokból minél többet meg kell szerezni, minden más pontszerzés ennél nehezebb.
---
Pontosítás: az első játékunk alatt a szabályból nem derült ki, hogy minden belső kerülethez külön kulcs kell-e. Azóta kiderült, hogy IGEN! Tehát hibásan játszottuk, így viszont kicsit leértékelődnek a 10 pontos mezők, de egyébként meg túl könnyűnek tűnt az a fajta pontszerzés...

Gold City made me think: "It's Thurn & Taxis on steroids!". At its core, it's a light-medium game in which players build a network of houses playing cards they collect... but it has many twists (an auction, the gathering of different rewards when establishing houses) that made it deeper and more entertaining for hardcore players. I don't know if it will see many plays (it's probably too complex for non gamers, and it's at most a filler for gamers), but I like it quite a lot. And it has gorgeous components (apart for the "paper victory points") and a very good 2-player variant!

Just like Valdora, this game has simple, elegant mechanics. Just like Valdora this game is easy for players to see the paths to incremental VP.  Just like Valdora there is very little down time.  Just like Valdora this game is beautiful to own.  And just like Valdora, I do not love this game.  I think what Schacht's newest games are missing is more crucial, position impacting conflict between players.  There is definitely _some_ conflict in this game (bidding for cards, positioning on roads) but they aren't the Coup De Grace blows that come out of Hansa, China, even Zooloretto.  I know Schacht is not about "heavy" games, but I'd like a more "intense" Schacht game again...

...oh and the paper VP in this game is STUPID!  Why not a VP track or cardboard chits?!?!?  STUPID!

Very nice graphics, as one could expect from a KOSMOS game. Not too innovative, as it mixes up several existing mechanics, but a pleasure to play, as everyone has small successes throughout the game.

A pretty simple, lighter game where players basically bid for the rights to land use permits in order to place building on the map to score points in various ways.  The game can actually get kind of nasty, as bidding people out of permits and blocking them on the map is prevalent, which I see as a good thing.  I can see some non-confrontational people being frustrated by this though.  It seems like there are multiple strategies that could be competitive here, although only further play will really tell if this is true or not.

This is vintage Michael Schacht. Right up there with Web of Power for classic Euro design. It's easy to see how this gets overlooked coming out in 2009/2010. No worker placement, no deck building, no much new at all. But it works, it's clean, and I like it. You play cards of a location type to build buildings there, just like Web of Power, but unlike WoP, in GC you're building builds to "get somewhere", and there's a fair amount of jostling along the way. And instead of just drawing cards, there's a fairly simple system of flopping out a bunch of cards, and each player getting two, so you know what's available, and aren't a slave to the cards available on your turn.

This game was a real surprise.  It's light on its surface, but as you play you unlock the strategies inside that make for a satisfying experience.

Players bid and collect pairs of cards to place businesses in the 4 terrain types, with each offering some benefit, such as extra cards, goods, bonus cards, and coins to outbid other players.  Each round bonuses are handed out for building in certain areas, and also for having certain goods; and for having the most you get double.  The one other challenge is you can't pick up the big points for the inner city unless you pick up a key first - which are found in out of the way places.

This game may lack depth for hard-core gamers, but for most players this is a great little route-builder that moves at a fast pace.  I liked it so much that similar games in my collection are in danger of being traded (I'm looking at you, La Strada).

Comparisons to Web of Power are not entirely apt. True, in both games you put pieces on places on the board that match the cards you play, but in The Golden City, area majority is (i) only one way among many to score and (ii) much more mundane than in Web of Power. TGC offers up more choices leading to a greater variety of scoring, but the game is so play-tested and so balanced that the choices seem not to matter a whole lot. Maybe six points will separate first place from last. The winner will have no idea why he won, and the loser will not know how to improve his chances the next time. I still enjoy it, but it is not a substitute for Web of Power.

Bid on cards which allow you to place ownership markers on the board.  Ownership markers give you other benefits which ultimately yield you points.  It's kind of fun, but nothing to write home about.   About a third of the way through the game, you really no longer care about objectives.  You are going to score what you score...you just hope to get the cards that let you beat others to the honey pot.

DEAL BREAKER: I'd rather just play China.

I bought this because I was so surprised by my love of China.  This seemed similar, but with some more stuff.  However, I'm not sure that the addition of so many more ways to score really helps the game.  This is a fine game, but I'm not sure that I would be likely to pick it over China when in the mood for this type of game.  I do need to give it a few more plays, though, and the two-player variant looks pretty interesting.  I might even like it better that way.

Some really neat things about this game: The card auction is well done.  I also like the way the game board is literally a map of the game mechanisms and balance.  For example, you need to move away from the city to grab a key  To grab a goal, you need to take a space that leads to nowhere.

The Golden City seems a solid euro with multiple scoring opportunities and paths to victory.  It does seem that the keys to the inner city and choosing the proper end game scoring cards are important.  Consequently, optimal card and hand management becomes critical to being able to get the desired locations.

There is more to this game than there seems at first.

A great family game.  Also a gateway game with its simple rules, very fast play, and beautiful components. 

Make routes, pickup items for points--I enjoy this kind of game.  I liked the scoring mechanics employed after every round--We had a minimum of a dozen I think, each one scoring differently depending on the card turned over at the beginning of each round.

I think the theme about developing business is nicely executed: Routes begin on the coast and develop inland; businesses along the river earn more points over the course of the game than rural businesses; business monopolies win extra points; and being first into different sections of The Golden City brings more rewards.

Bonuses can win or lose the game, but getting bonus cards early can be a big advantage.  

In a month's time I have taught/played with 14 people, and all but one liked it.

Pleasant game composed out of smoothly-fitting parts. I'm not a huge fan of the spatial aspect or the minor area control, and I think the game might be stretching a bit with the very limited goods cards. I do like the idea that you're trying to reach the Golden City at the centre of the board though.

With limited storage for games I'm extremely picky about purchasing new games.  It therefore comes as a surprise that I really didn't like Golden City.

It seems to be dominated by the luck from the bonus cards and whether you already have (by chance) the requested items from previous rounds !  ok, so it may be possible to acquire them in the current round but it happened in our games that the same bonus card appeared in succession.  One player had alreaady acquired all the bonus positions earlier so leaped ahead when scoring.

The 'auction' element of choosing the landscape cards seems very watered down, and most players typically opted for the non-confrontational route of choosing an unselected pair.

I don't think it's a bad game but I never felt in control of what I was doing or able to re-coup some of the points deficit between myself and the leader.  Not a game I'll play again when I've many more interesting to choose from...

The Golden City is a family-compatible game of network building. Players acquire terrain cards in a simple bidding process, then use those cards to place trading posts on the board which in turn can be used to generate trading contracts (aka victory points) in various ways.

As this description implies the game is a rather generic euro that neither disappoints nor impresses. It combines a number of familiar mechanics in an inoffensive, streamlined package. Its most interesting characteristic is most likely that there are several ways of generating points from trading posts, depending on where you build them.

I enjoyed out first outing of this, and am looking forward to playing again.  Lovely pieces, the theme works better for me than Valdora, and the game plays fast and flows well, with multiple pathways to explore.  Only marked down a little due to its Euro-generality - mechanisms you have seen before.  This is like a pimped Web of Power; if MS does his usual great work in adding small variants and additions my rating could grow.

3 plays in and enjoying.  Well balanced - you can pursue different scoring methods and still come close.  May all be down to the card combos available to buy, but then you should have had more coins...

Players bid for cards, take cards, use cards to build houses in four different areas.  Building a house gives new cards or money for bidding or victory points or access to area with extra high vicory points,  Works nicely but isn't really new or original.

Simple, elegant, fast and beautiful. Similar to "Web of Power"/"China" (from the same designer) in the card playing mechanic, with a touch of "Amazonas" in the way you must expand via a connected network. Pretty good for families and gamers alike. It's best with four players, for the added competition and the better balance in the bonus cards.

My only gripe is the way the theme was approached. So, you have this mysterious golden city in the middle of the wilderness, and you go there to... open shops?! There isn't even a single mechanic that resembles commerce. This could have easily been an adventure themed game.

In the Golden City, players bid on pairs of cards, then use them to claim spots on the board, leading into the city.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2017)

Die Goldene Stadt was one of my oldest unplayed games. I acquired it on July 2013 so it took me more than 4 years to finally play it. When I bought it, I was a different person and I bought it because I liked Coloretto from designer Michael Schacht. In that year I enjoyed his designs, but I have changed in these years and I no longer enjoy light games as much as I used to. After playing Die Goldene Stadt, I can say it can be a good family game, but it is way too light for my current tastes.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex. You can explain the game under 10 minutes. Playtime is around 95 minutes.

The art of the game is pretty good and the game looks gorgeous on the table. The game´s components are ok.

There is no theme, or rather, you don´t feel the theme anywhere in the game.

The gameplay isn’t very complex, but you have to think the best options. The most interesting part of the game is the bidding for the cards, however, as you can only increase the cost in one coin, you never have a way to defend your position. Money can be thigh (furthermore at the beginning), so playing order can decide which player gets which cards. During the game, there wasn’t many bidding wars as both parties lose all the money they bid. After this phase, I feel the game plays (more or less) automatically with easy/obvious decisions. 

I also like the scoring system, at the beginning of the round a card is revealed with the goals for the round, sometimes you cannot achieve the scoring condition, no matter what you do, other times you already have the scoring condition from a past round, so you don't need to do anything else to score. There is some luck here, but I’m still undecided if it bothers me or not.

Bottom line, Die Goldene Stadt can be a good family game, but I crave heavier euro games. As it stands, it is harmless. It can be a good game to introduce people to our hobby. There is some luck with the cards, I’m still undecided if it is too much or not. I will sell it as my desire to play it again is low.

What can I say, this game left me cold. One person said, it felt like the game was missing something. A sense of tension, to begin with. Also, there's too much randomness to make a lot of meaningful decisions. The victory card conditions hand out points to whomever happens to have the right combo. Since you only start with a few coins, the amount of blocking during bidding is rather limited. Even if you stockpile, you end up wasting time not gathering other valuable resources.

Players take turns selecting cards that allow them to build a route from the coast toward the city in the center. Sometimes money will be used to push a player off a card. Before the card selection a card with scoring goals is turned over. This will indicate a region and a commodity that will give victory points at the end of the round. Commodities are gained by building on certain spots that give a commodity card. Victory points are also gained inside the city with the central area of the city giving the most points. Watch out for other players blocking your preferred path.

One of the better Schacht games around. Not as deep as Web of Power, closest in complexity to Valdora but more generic. Multiple ways to score, network expansion, a bit of money management and a light auction: it is as "Euro" as a game could get which is no problem for me. As can be guessed it is nothing outstanding or original, just a plain solid design suitable for family gaming as well.

RATING: 7
A total Michael Schacht game - completely abstract game with a humdrum theme pasted on, yet succeeds in spite of these shortcomings due to its short play time, interesting decisions and multiple paths to victory.

The board looks nice, but does little to obscure the fact that you're just putting houses down on a board.  The connection aspect is mildly interesting, and the card drafting part of the game is random enough to provide variety, forcing you to update your plans.  Some will not like the rather restrictive nature of the game (hand limit is 5), but I tend to enjoy games with very limited options on your turn.

My first impression is that some of the cards are overpowered (the money -> VP and the goods cards -> VP), but since it's essentially a race game, there are multiple races (race to the center spots, race to certain cards, etc.

Pleasant surprise. Was not expecting to enjoy it this much.

...but came across, yet again, after not playing for a while, the rule whereby the game ends as soon as someone can't place a business on their turn. Crushed the last game for us, after a long explanation, and costs this game a rating point, because that just sucked.

[2013] Somehow we got the rule wrong! It was due to poor teacher, bad player aid, and bad translation from German.

This isn't the sort of Euro that gets me most excited - it's a bit of a themeless exercise in matrix arithmetic, and might easily strike one as too slavish an attempt to imitate Settlers. But the components are very pretty and unorthodox, it's easy to learn for a game with this many moving parts. 

More importantly, I was really impressed by the degree of tactical depth that emerged during gameplay. It's an extremely tough decision whether to just beat a quick path toward the inner city or expend one's resources more on goods and bonus cards. And toward the endgame, the auction phase can get very tense and aggressively competitive. The simplicity of the rules should by no means deter more experience gamers.

Not horrible, but there were a couple of things I view as shortcoming in the design.

For example, when selecting pairs of cards each turn, it would be nice if the player who "outbids" a prior player got the chance to actually set the bid so it would be possible to force another player out of the running for that lot.  

And, if a player is outbid, it seems like it would help retain any start player advantage to let the bumped player immediately select again.  

Aside from minor quibbles like that, it's an okay game.  Just not something that does much for me.

Apart from looking good, I didn't quite know what to expect from this one -- it's a fun game. Reading the rules, the mechanics didn't quite come together for me, but in play they mesh well and fairly intuitively. I grokked it well enough to come in second on play one.

The bidding mechanic is fantastic, and the area control element (especially the key requirement) is nicely implemented. It feels a bit saggy towards the end, as we had to go several turns past the point where it was clear that one of two players would win. That could just have been a quirk of the first play, though.

I wish the paper money was chits, like in Puerto Rico. It looks good, but all of the other bits in this game are so high-quality that it's a shame to have paper money in the mix.

After the glow wore off, this spent months getting passed over while I wondered why I'd been so excited about it. It's definitely a good game, but ultimately I decided to sell it.

A very good gateway game. This is very important to me, as I like to bring new gamers into the hobby of board games. We played this with our 11 year old son and we all had a great time. Don't be fooled there is enough strategy here to satisfy the more experienced gamer as well as the beginner.

Nice basic game, easy to learn. I could play this with my family. Oddly cheap and flimsy VP tickets for otherwise quality components - they'll probably be scruffy and torn after only a couple of plays.

What a surprise.  I picked this up from the "Discount Bin" of Tanga years ago and never got it to the table.  I finally broke it out assuming it would be mediocre, so that I could put it on the "trade pile" as I need to downsize my collection.

Surprise, surprise, this game is a total hit.  It's basically a "German Family Weight" euro, but it has enough depth and teeth to appeal to "gamers".  There is inherent tension with the light area-control and the light bidding mechanisms.  Everyone is involved the entire game, and turns move quickly as there are only a few options on any given turn.

One downside is that the theme is weak, however the mostly above average presentation helps counter that with a lovely board and good components...except the paper "money" which is weirdly called "letters of business" in an errant attempt at helping the theme.

You play the players almost as much as the game, so while the board doesn't change, the conveyor belt of land cards, the bidding over them, and the way they're used to control the board may provide quite a lot of longevity.

There are some concerns that there is an imbalance in the scoring cards because often the Rank 3 cards don't all come up.  I've seen this happen, but at least one game went through all the cards with 4 players.  A suggested variant worth trying is to randomly remove 4 Rank 2 cards, which will keep the balance.

Standard eurogame, but I don't mean that in a bad way. Everything feels familiar, the rules are short and easy to teach, there's room for a little dickitry (with the card drafting) and the game is about efficient route-building and taking advantage the scoring changes each round. Nice game.

In the Golden City there are many spots on the board to occupy in 4 areas of grass, sand, mountain, and field.  If you use two cards of the type of area (two of a kind also = joker) you are trying to occupy will get you a spot provided you can move there from a previously occupied spot (or start from the ocean again), ocean-adjacent spots only require one card.  Every spot also gives you a bonus of some sort.  

Placing a piece in the Golden City requires two of the same cards and a key, an item you can get from occupying a spot that gives that bonus.  

Every turn there is a point card flipped over to tell you what spots will receive points (river-adjacent/regions) and the type of good that will receive points, goods are received from special spot bonuses.  

Players receive more cards to occupy spots by a bidding system.  Place your hand token on the pair of cards you want, other players can boot you off by paying gold pieces, the price raising every boot per round.

Game ends after a set amount of turns.  Winner is determined from the points they received from bonus cards (taken by spot bonuses) and points received by the round cards scored after every round.  

The game is actually pretty straight-forward and enjoyable while playing.  I do not feel the urge to get this back to the table, but would play it again in a heartbeat.

After a while, it felt really repetitive. I wonder if there is a way to right-size the arc of the game. The mechanics are fine and light -- light in the sense that anything you might be building toward (bonus cards, key cards, goods, businesses in the city) is attained in exactly same way: by trading in cards. No having to go to one place to get one resource, then praying to a god for another resource, then putting your doohickey in a third place to have the right to build; just trade in matching cards -- and every round you automatically get 2 cards anyway. The experience of the game is samey-samey, with the primary opportunity for variety occurring when players vie for pairs of cards. So far, Felinia is winning the Gold Trilogy.

A great family-weight game with a fun theme of exploring an island with a city of gold!  Picking where to build your businesses is fun.  The bidding mechanic for your cards at the start of each turn is simple to grasp and fun to implement.  The game gives you the choice of always planning for long term scoring (aka, getting into the Golden City), or going for immediate scoring with scoring cards that will possibly score you points at the end of each turn.  Just find a way to replace that paper money! :)  I recommend this one.

This game has an interesting auction mechanism: there are many lots available, and basically you lose your bid on lots that you were outbid on.  However, there's not that much differentiation in the lots, so bidding doesn't get that extreme.  You're trying to claim spots on the board, some of which will give you point bonuses, others of which will help you get other spots on the board.  Some of the items that you get for claiming spots may be end-game bonus cards, which often give you points for having tokens in a particular region.  This is a fun, light game where you really want to claim things before your opponents, as generally only one token can occupy each spot.

Web of Power had been, in my opinion, Schacht's best design. China was WoP with a bit of tinkering (maps that adjusted for the number of players, the doubling disc,etc.). It was a modification with a little improvement. In Golden City, Schacht returns to the connection game but has 'gone all out'. It is WoP on steroids. There are multiple paths to scoring including player specific methods. No one method is certain. The rules are simple but the choices are almost unlimited. WoP and China could have been something of a Knizia design. Each offered two methods for scoring. Golden City is closer to a Kramer or Colovini design with so much to consider. Simply excellent.


Note: I have had the opportunity to play the game with the two player rules and was surprised to discover there is more depth to the game. It is actually more difficult as there are fewer turns and the area becomes limited. Management of the land cards from turn to turn is critical.

These phrases from my geekbuddy analysis will give you some idea of the game: "Standard eurogame, but I don't mean that in a bad way. Everything feels familiar"; "just another Euro game, but with just enough going on for it to be interesting"; "A good, solid, game that plays quickly and painlessly"; "Probably a decent game to introduce eurogames to nongamers"; "Pleasant game composed out of smoothly-fitting parts"; "a rather generic euro that neither disappoints nor impresses";"Perfectly functional". 

Yep, we're firmly in family Euro territory, with absolutely nothing I hadn't seen before (a bit of bidding, a bit of area control, a bit of set collection, a bit of secret goals), but it works... fine. I can't see this being anyone's favourite game, but neither can I see it being anyone's least favourite.

Rather light family/Euro game. The artwork and presentation is nice, although the victory point papers are awful. I feel that the game is imbalanced in parts (the bonus 2 points / some of the bonus cards), but I reckon this is just the underlying family nature of the Euro game, making it less cutthroat and more luck-based in parts OR maybe I need to play it more to see how close the scores are and whether there are multiple paths to victory. Not as much interaction/confrontation as I though there would be, but still a neat game.

I really want to like this game.  However, the broken bonus cards (and minor initial turn order imbalance) make that difficult.  I'm willing to give it another try (especially with only 3 players), but I'd house-rule the Gold Bonus Card to 1 per (instead of 2) and the Market Bonus Card to 2 per (instead of 3).  Seriously, a single bonus card shouldn't give anyone 24 points (and yes, one player in our game had 12 gold for 24 points at the end), and you should really have to work hard to get 6+.  With these changes, I'd probably rate it at least a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I wouldnt say that this has zero strategy, but it is almost impossible to plan ahead in this game. The score cards are random each round and theres usually not enough actions in a round to achieve a scoring condition unless you already qualify for the points. In future plays i could see myself using more confrontational tactics in bidding or focusing on the bonus cards, but the overall mechanics here seem pretty thoughtless. Not a bad game, just too light for my tastes.

A game about getting sets of cards, obtained mainly in auction, that allow players to lay down little wooden houses to take different kind of resources (cards, trading goods, money and bonus cards) or to score directly. Even when everything is formally correct, the sin of this game is that there is nothing in the design that takes the breath away or feels innovative, that push for another play, altough it provides a pleasant experience when it actually hits the table.

This isn't just a mash-up of European mechanisms, but also a mash-up of Schacht's own games, since there's some Web of Power/China in the cards, some Hansa in the oddly linked map and myriad victory paths from Valdora.

The auction round feels really gimmicky, and seems to degenerate into everybody getting scared of the guy with the big money and ducking competition (since both parties lose if you get into a bidding war). Often just became "pick your favorite pair of cards in turn order".

Reminiscent of nearly all of Schacht's games in that you must keep a tab on every player to know what they're going for, so you go for the contested ones first. This one has a lot of little objectives though, so it is a little overwhelming to figure out what to do. Will probably be better with experience.

This is a simple area-control style game where there is a nice little auction mechanic to bid on the cards you use to establish your routes.  I can't say that it's really earth-shattering or great, but fun enough for occasional play.  The board is really pretty, which is always a nice plus.

UPDATE: Maybe it was just my experience with three players, but this game is quite unremarkable. I do like the little auction to choose the routes, but that's really about it.

1 play, 4er. I was dead last. By a mile :(

An interesting area-majority game with card play somewhat similar to Web of Power -- generally must play 1 or 2 cards matching the region in order to place a marker there. This game, though, is a step up in complexity: may expand only along lines of connection, multiple partially-overlapping regions (coastal, rural, city, landscape, riverside), bidding for card draw, and several ways to collect VP (including semi-hidden bonus cards). But not too big a step -- the game mechanisms are pretty clear. However, I think I prefer the clean simplicity and purity of Web of Power. 

Looking forward to playing this more!

Just not that compelling.  There's some competition in the auctions but not really that much.  The decisions on tile placement are semi-interesting.  The bonus tiles are difficult to recognize.  It takes too long for what it is, making the game feel a little bit dull and repetitive.  It seems like it has the seeds of a great game but doesn't make the jump.

I like the game. However, not sure where it fits in the family V gamers game spectrum. In your first game difficult to tell if you are first or last. Needs a few games to understand the value of bidding - plus the round scoring appears a little random first game out. However, mechanics and board are fabulous (lots of admiring glances at swiggers) , cards a bit on the flimsy side. more likely to go down to a six than up to a eight. 2nd play - definitely suffers firsttime out as scoring cardsare a bit of a mystery. However, mechanics work well and very much liked by second group of gamers

Light but playable route building game. The object is to construct routes from the outside of an island into the centre of a city situated in the middle. In order to do this players are required to place businesses along roads, and this is achieved by placing matching terrain cards (of which there are four). The cards are put on offer for bidding at the start of the round and an auction takes place as players attempt to acquire the cards that will be most useful to them. When businesses are place they bestow a one time benefit to the player depending on the space they were situated, such as more money, another terrain card, goods for scoring purposes. At the end of each round scoring takes place and points are allocated depending on the round's stipulations (one of which will be having businesses on a certain area of the board, the other owning a certain type of goods card). The gameplay is light (not necessarily a bad thing) but there is quite a bit going on here beneath the surface and there is enough of a challenge in timing your progress to the centre of the city to make this a worthwhile gaming experience.

The unique bidding system for cards clips right along since it always costs one additional coin to kick someone off his choice.  The scoring cards give something to shoot for every turn, and the bonus cards allow for long term planning.  Very good game overall!

With an easy set of rules and clever mechanisms a quick but still rather strategic game.

The only point of critisism might be the fix plan which might wear down the replayability.

Want to play again soon.

A disappointing Schacht offering. I found The Golden City to be somewhere between pedestrian and outright dull.

This is another nice game from Michael Schacht. Definitely more abstract than Valdora, it has some interesting decisions to be made. The knock that I may have with it is that players could find themselves with little to do if they are not placing businesses in city locations giving new cards, but those same spots don't help too much with scoring opportunities so it may be a wash. I played a collecting goods strategy with the 3 point bonus per goods card bonus card in hand and I got edged out by somebody going for location cards. Very nice game overall.

The Golden City is just too tactical for my tastes.  The board lends itself to strategic thought but the tiny hand size and the randomized scoring deck force one to play reactively.  The luck-of-the-draw "auction" at the beginning of each round becomes grating.

Nice. Solid. Decent. However you want to put it: this is a good value for the time, money and learning investment you made. 

(Meaning it's easy to understand - family game style - it's fast-paced and it's affordable) Nothing spectacular and still enjoyable

Every time I play this game, everyone spontaneously spends a while afterward energetically discussing what they should have done differently -- even the winner. Every single decision is extremely important, and there is precious little room for error.

Okay game, just kind of lackluster.  Nothing wrong with it, it just seems kind of plain.  I like the way Schacht strips things down in Hansa, Web of Power, Dschunke, etc. but this just comes off as vanilla euro to me.

RATING: 7
This is a light Euro that both my wife and daughter enjoy. It's pretty simple to teach but has enough available options / paths to victory that it can be engaging. I personally like a little more depth to my games, but this one works if the object is to bring out something different and/or accessible.

From far away, the adventurers have come to the island with the golden city in its center. Just arrived, they open up the first shop directly at the coast. Already it is possible to open up other ones in the villages along the street connections.

That's worth it because through that you'll get goods, keys, money, and concessions that you need for getting ahead. And finally the first is able to establish himself in the golden City and thus get the most precious trading contracts.

Some interesting balance between points now and setting up for points later.  A rare case where I actually like the endgame bonus scoring cards, because a) you get to choose the card you want, and b) you can sacrifice better positioning to go for better bonus cards earlier.

Can feel a little chaotic with 4 players, with players before you taking your moves, though you can plan around this a bit by watching the cards they take.  Also has a bit of a knowledge-or-luck aspect where you're really going to want to know what scoring cards are coming up.

Simple, fun, gorgeous Schacht game. Claim cards, use those cards to build in various areas of the board, earning different kinds of bonuses. Good timing and positioning are key.

(05/10)  Strategic Schacht game of optimization.  There appear to be mulitple paths to victory and look forward to trying a few different strategies to see if that is true.  In our 1st 4p game one person built all their houses in about round 12 (lots of ports).  

Possible house rule/tweak:  Can bid with a coin or coins right away if desired to "set the price of a pair of cards."

This game doesn't seem to make up a whole. it's just like a garment made from different patches. it only pretends to work together. moreover, I don't like the "stand here and take this" mechanism, it's too "childish". generally, a beautiful box holds nothing interesting. looks for me as if the author didn't have any idea for the game.

RATING: 6
To be brief: I like the game.  It retains a little bit of the feel of Web of Power, in the way that you use cards to build into regions of the board, and you're maintaining connections between all your placements on the board.  The bidding for cards is interesting, though the randomness of how they come up can mean that there's very little interaction between the players, since the different choices could be individually good for each player.  In addition, the scoring cards lend a lot of potential replays to the game, since the game will never develop the same way twice, and the bonus cards can keep things interesting near the end of the game, when the major placements have all been taken.  It's definitely one I will play again.

Teaching: (Yet to teach).
Mastery: (60 minutes as quoted).
Square box.

Schacht's Golden City very much feels like a slightly more complex version of his 2005 game China, but now with one less player, bidding for location cards to replace the simpler drafting, 15 more minutes and the added layer of resource management. I guess some folks might hate how similar certain games can be, but as mentioned in the China comments, I find these are great teaching tools and feeders into other more dense games. 

For my groups, I'm quite interested in cultivating skills that will equip players for super dense games in the future, and these games seem to fit several bills quite well. Will see how they go once running - the slight concern here is the player count, but I feel like eventually I'll be able to run it.

Multiple ways to earn victory points. Good mechanics. A bit random, some items very limited so easy to monopolize.

In The Golden City event cards are flipped up each turn tell you what two scoring opportunities will be available on that turn. One scoring opportunity will be from location of buildings and the other from good cards acquired. 

Players claim location cards which will allow you to choose where to build. (There is some possible conflict here, and is one of the more engaging mechanisms.) 

Then players build and gain the resources on the spaces on which they have constructed. (Building in some locations requires a special, limited availability, item acquired from other select build locations.) 

To win you need to get the right goods early. Control map choke points limiting the ability for other players to build where they want, and get to the center of the board before other players so you can get the bonus points. Being in a position to take advantage of the scoring cards, and get the market leader for those scoring opportunities seems to be nearly as much luck as skill.

One of my favorite light Euro-games, and one that is criminally overlooked by most serious gamers.  The components are gorgeous, and gameplay is incredibly streamlined.  This is a great gateway game with just enough strategy to keep experienced gamers coming back for more.

Each player will get a pair of terrain cards per round. You draft the pair from a face up display. I cost a 1, 2, 3 coins each time someone wants bump a player off of a pair of cards. The bumped player then decides to bump another player or take a free pair. Then there are 2 rounds o playing a card and claiming something in that territory. The center of the city has the big vp but you have to chain your way from the port to the city. Neat game. I liked it a lot.

this turned out to be very fun for my group...easy to teach and play, nice production...the bidding can be odd: either everyone is aggressive with outbidding or they are content to each get their own set of cards...liked the buildup of the island, as things get tighter you need to make tougher decisions...we wished the money was used for more than just outbidding though...

Hmm. I enjoyed the mechanics of this game, but I didn’t realize the best strategy until it was too late. One of the three of us figured it out, and he ended up monopolizing the capital. I like the movement restrictions imposed by your hand of cards, and I also like the card drafting each round. I would have to play this a couple more times to get a better read for the game.

Cada ronda una carta indica que se puntúa. Luego se subasntan pares de cartas de terreno. Con tus cartas construyes negocios. Cada localización tiene una habilidad. Para construir al centro de la ciudad necesitas llaves.

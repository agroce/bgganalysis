Is this as good as Netrunner? It scratches a different itch so perhaps that will be enough to keep it going. Very short but with a lot of important decisions to make. I'm not wholly convinced though.

RATING: 6
Solid game, which borrows lots of its mechanics from other LCG's, though I'm sceptical of the way FFG treats the Warhammer Fantasy/40k franchise. That sudden death of the Warhammer Fantasy LCG was a pretty cheap action and is the reason I'm wary on this one.

RATING: 6.5
So far, I think this has been very over-hyped and I'm not seeing the depth.  I will try to stick with it for a while and see what happens with the game but my current thoughts are that this is not a long-term game for me.

RATING: 8
+ The dual nature of the command struggle compared to the actual battle/combat makes it so that you are always pressed to make the most of your various resources.
- There are too many good 2 player games, LCG specifically; Not sure if this will have the staying power of others.

The game itself is simple to play and mostly intuitive once you grasp the basic interactions, but there's a lot of strategy and planning to consider just below the surface. Setup is pretty damn easy, and Conquest can be played pretty much anywhere there's a decent amount of flat surface.

After playing all of the LCG games (with the exception of AGOT), mostly only with the coreset, I cannot stop comparing WARHAMMER 40,000: CONQUEST with the others. 

Graphics wise, the illustrations on the cards are beautiful, as are on all the other LCG cards. The rules are light-medium, a little bit more complex, comparing to Warhammer: Invasion or Call of Cthulhu, but less complex than Star Wars or Android: Netrunner

The gameplay, on the other hand, seems alot closer to the one in A:NR, as you need to (second/double)guess what your opponent's plans are and what he wants to achieve. 

My ranking of the confrontational LCGs is:
Warhammer: Invasion > Warhammer 40K: Conquest > Star Wars > Android: Netrunner > Call of Cthulhu

As I do not enjoy deck building, probably this will have the same level of investment as the others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While this takes aspects of many of Eric Lang's previous LCGs, the Warhammer: Invasion DNA seems strongest, which is disappointing as that was also his weakest. 

My initial impression was not great - it seemed chaotic, while also allowing one side to get an unassailable lead. I've only played once, so take that with a large grain of salt.

Very good game.  I love the variety of races and decks you can build.  Its a tight complex 2 player strategy/tactical card game in the Warhammer 40K universe.  If you have no knowledge or are a not a big fan of the 40K universe the game still plays perfectly well.

I dont play 40K but love this game.  It is a shame Fantasy Flight and games Workshop parted ways, you can still get hold of the core set and some expansions but it is essentially shelved and out of print at the moment.

Grab a copy while you can!

Down rated only because it is now at the end of life for a "living card game" . Now creating "flavor based" decks rather than tournament competitive decks so that I can enjoy and play with all of the factions and cards released.

Finished the campaign with my brother. It was telling that he didn’t enjoy the game sometimes because the location based benefits are swingy and not parsable in strategy at times. I fully acknowledge that overall the  randomness of this version of 40k is slightly higher than the tabletop game, but only slightly. The other unfortunate part is that I am now starting to think of better ways to design the game. Which is not a good sign for a game.

Played a demo once at PAX. Want to play again - strategies and ideas kept flowing. This feels more... holistic?... than Netrunner. What I mean is this - Netrunner felt more like "ooh, look at what I can do with this cool card." This is more "how can I best use all my cards for the rest of the game?" This feels more strategic and less tactical. That's the word I want.

RATING: 7
Καινούργιο LCG από την Fantasy Flight στον κόσμο του warhammer 40k για τον οποίο προσωπικά δεν έχω καμία ιδέα. Είναι ένα μελλοντικό sci-fi fantasy σκηνικό με γήινους και διάφορους εξωγήινους, δαίμονες και ποιος ξέρει τι άλλο, να πλακώνονται για τον έλεγχο πλανητών. Καλή φάση.

Στο κουτί υπάρχουν 7 τράπουλες factions (αργότερα θα βγουν και άλλα 2) με το καθένα να έχει το δικό του χαρακτήρα και τρόπο παιχνιδιού. Πχ άλλοι κατεβάζουν πολλά μικρά τερατάκια, άλλοι εξοπλίζουν τα units τους με μπόλικα equipments/attachments και γίνονται μπουριά ενώ άλλοι περιστρέφονται γύρω από τον αρχηγό τους. Και μιας και το ανέφερα η κάθε φυλή έχει έναν αρχηγό/warlord με κάποια ξεχωριστή ιδιότητα, ενώ ένας τρόπος να κερδίσεις το παιχνίδι είναι το να σκοτώσεις τον warlord του αντιπάλου. Ο άλλος τρόπος νίκης είναι να πάρεις υπό τον έλεγχο σου 3 πλανήτες ενός είδους/χρώματος.

Πάμε στο gameplay. Καταρχήν μου άρεσε η γενικότερη ροή του παιχνιδιού. Δεν παίζουμε ο καθένας στον γύρο του αλλά πάμε ταυτόχρονα εναλλάξ σε κάθε φάση. Δηλαδή κατεβάζει μια κάρτα ο ένας, κατεβάζει ο άλλος, το ίδιο και στις μάχες. Αυτό κάνει τα πράματα σαφώς πιο ενδιαφέροντα. Υπάρχουν κάθε φορά 5 πλανήτες και διαλέγουμε που θα κατεβάσουμε τα units μας.

Δεύτερον δεν υπάρχει το αρχικό build-up. Ξεκινάμε από την αρχή με αρκετά resources και μπαίνουμε αμέσως στην δράση. Φυσικά ο κάθε πλανήτης παράγει resources και κάρτες για τον παίκτη που τον ελέγχει αλλά υπάρχει και ένα εγγυημένο minimum. Γενικά το παιχνίδι έχει γρήγορο ρυθμό και μπόλικη δράση. 

Μου άρεσε που υπήρχε μια κλιμάκωση στο τέλος. Τουλάχιστον στις 3-4 παρτίδες που παίξαμε, δεν ξέρω αν συμβαίνει πάντα. Ξεκινήσαμε με μικρές μάχες σε διάφορους πλανήτες αλλά όταν φτάσαμε στο σημείο να έχουμε ο καθένας από 2 πλανήτες και ήμασταν ένα κλικ πριν το τέλος, αναγκαστήκαμε και μπήκαμε all in στην τελευταία επική μάχη.

Υπάρχει επίσης και ένα μικρό στοιχείο μπλόφας/διάβασμα αντιπάλου για το που θα στείλει ο καθένας τον warlord του. Το παιχνίδι δεν είναι πολύ βαρύ. Είναι πιο κάτω σε πολυπλοκότητα από το Netrunner για παράδειγμα. Βέβαια μιλάμε για LCG που σημαίνει μπόλικο κείμενο και abilities οπότε θέλει αφοσιωμένο αντίπαλο για να δείξει την αξία του. Επίσης είναι μεγάλη χρηματική επένδυση αφού κάθε μήνα βγαίνουν πακετάκια.

Αξιόλογο καρτοπαιχνιδο. Αν είστε φαν του Warhammer και έχετε κάνα φιλαράκι που ενδιαφέρετε να εντρυφήσει, τότε προχωρήστε. Θεωρώ πως το Netrunner και ίσως και το Game of Thrones είναι καλύτερο σαν παιχνίδι (LCG) αλλά σαφώς παίζει ρόλο και το τι theme προτιμά ο καθένας.

RATING: 9.25
My current favorite LCG. I obviously love the 40k theme, but the gameplay is my favorite aspect here. I really enjoy that the resources to play the game (cards and the credits to play them) are involved in the game as something to fight over. This is my favorite solution to economy in a card game since Warhammer Invasion. Additionally the fact that your armies keep fighting until death or retreat feels both thematic and brutal when compared to the more tradition "armies hit each other and that is it." I just wish more people would play the game the 2 or 3 times required to understand that playing all of your cards on planet 1 is a horrible decision.

Simply superb: The game mechanisms implement the theme perfectly; the factions play quite differently but in ways that match their fictional counterparts.  The rules are clear and concise, the art is excellent - as one would expect from FFG - and the strategy gets very, very deep.  I'm hard to please:  I've bough hundreds of games, but wind up selling 95% of them after a few weeks.  Not so with this one: Every aspect of Conquest is compelling; there is no rule I would wish to tweak and no phase of the game that is frustrating or lackluster, so I'm giving it a 10.

I would not be surprised to see Conquest become an even bigger hit than Android: Netrunner.  Go buy this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
I'm not a fan of how FFG releases these core sets so that you'll need 2 or 3 to put together quality decks, and that practice continues in Conquest, but otherwise it's a good enough, simple flow of play where you're sending a warlord and troops to fight over planets with both power struggles and straight up combat. Act and react to the opponent's moves. The art is stunning, the factions fairly balanced although it will need a lot of fleshing out with battle packs and larger expansion boxes before that is ultimately determined. Good game, but I prefer LOTR, Warhammer: Invasion and Android: Netrunner.

I was determined to avoid this game: I am a former GW enthusiast but I grew tired by the company policies, and furthermore I didn't really need to become involved in another LCG...
Then a friend insisted and I tried it.
And another passionate damnation began...

The game literally has layer upon layer of strategy.

When building decks, one must try to include units to win command struggles and units to win battles: winning struggles is pointless if an army is destroyed in battles, but it's difficult to win battles without winning struggles.

When playing, unit placement is never trivial: short term vs long term needs must be constantly considered, and nothing is easily figured out.
There is lots of margins for good play.

A great game. Truly.

RATING: 9
On the surface, Conquest seems like a bland, uninspired game: one can easily point to the mechanisms found in other games and the cards don't seem to have profound abilities. The game really shines in its framework, which meshes individually simplistic actions into a deeply strategic and tactical war game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I suppose this game could be fun if you dedicate a lot of time to flipping through page after page for every little move you make, arguing about frameworks and action window definitions, and squinting your eyes to read tons of extra rules on each and every card. I simply do not have the patience.

After playing 2 games separated by a few months, while I find the game more fun then I expected, it is far more complicated then it needs to be for how simple the game is. (collect a set of 3 matching colors)

Playing 1 game was not enough to allow the rules to stick. the second game was like learning how to play all over again, with the need to consult the rule book multiple times because of how unintuitive the rules are.

The artwork is fantastic, and I really enjoy the theme. I feel like I need to play more games to get an opinion.

RATING: 8
While I am not attracted to the whole one-on-one combat theme, I think this game has some very good things going for it. First and foremost the fact that you are simultaneously competing for command struggles (to gain cards and money), for battle bonuses (when you win a battle at a planet) and for planet 1 (to ultimately win the game) AND keep your leader alive or kill the other guys leader makes for some VERY interesting choices. THAT's the mark of a good card game. You have to constantly have interesting choices. That's what Android: Netrunner does so incredibly well and I think this game also succeeds. Also, the artwork is freaking brilliant - even better than in Netrunner.

Now, I have only played this with standard preset decks and only own one core set. I will probably not invest further in this game, but just enjoy the core set gameplay, which is very good as it is.

Each race feels very different, and the best part about the game is the pace of it.  Each turn is vitally important.  Perhaps you won't win/lose due to the result on one planet, but how do you turn that less important turn into the right resources for the next, where your whole plan will need to come together and your opponent knows it.  Very intense and very quick once you know the game.

A great implementation of the 40k universe (without the need to invest heavily to enjoy it), topped off with streamlined, fun combat mechanics that make sense.

Definitely one of the better LCGs from FFG. I love the 40K universe and Conquest does a fair job of pulling it into a card game format.

Mechanically the system is ok though there are a few areas where I think it could have been better handled. The only real grumble is that it is far too easy to win by hunting the enemy warlord which can lead to a disappointing game for one player.

I'm not likely to turn down a game of this. If only more players locally played it.

Another year, another LCG to keep track of. This one feels like a mixture of Blood Bowl: Team Manager – The Card Game and Warhammer: Invasion that comes with seven very different factions in the base-box. While I expect keeping track of the meta to be very taxing once the game gets rolling, it offers lots of replayability with the base-game alone. The theme is a big plus for me. Once again, there's one-offs and two-offs, making serious deckbuilding a matter of buying multiple boxes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Enjoying this immensely. I love the back and forth card play, the command phase then battle phase, and as a former 40k player I love the lore. Want to play it lots more right now!

Edit: Moving this up. I am deeply invested here now because I am loving this game so much. The resource management battle that goes on is wonderfully deep and the battles themselves are unique and interesting compared with every other card game I have ever played.

Edit 2: Quickly becoming my most played game. I love the setting and the game and the community is super cool and accepting too. I am surprised how much I love it and moved the rating up to a 10. It will surely fall off once the people in my office lose interest and I will lower the rating then, but for now this is in the running for my favorite game.

Edit 3: Haven't played in months. Game is discontinued which is disheartening. I am not as big a fan of the elites meta the game was moving toward since it seems to work around the command struggle which is an important reason I love the game so much.

I'm a fan of the 40,000 universe. I played the tabletop miniatures game for years, roleplayed in the universe a few times and read many a novel. So the theme of the game was something I already knew I liked.

I've also played a number of LCGs (Star Wars, Netrunner, Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings) so the format of the game was also something I knew I liked.

So my rating is purely based on the how I found the mechanics of Conquest. I didn't like them, none of the plays I had with any opponent gave me any sense of interest or desire to pursue this game.

I quickly shelved it and never entertained the idea of buying more cards for it. I'd be happy to sell or trade my copy away.

after 3 games: very good evolution step of WH40K card games: good mechanics, nice artwork and feels like WH40K (except for deckbuilding, but that's for sake of deckbuilding)

after first cycle: some races like Tyranids and Space Marines are fun to play and play against, some didn't have much chance to shine and some are strong but boring (Eldar)... things haven't change for some time, but the Tyranids look very very promising now

Becoming a little tired of the lcg format and certainly sick of the 40k universe, but after giving this a crack I've had enough fun to pick up the game. Smart play mitigates a poor hand, which is something I really appreciate in card games, and accordingly deck building feels a little more relaxed and entertaining. Get someone to demo the game next you get a chance- it's good.

Good game, reminds me of a more in depth smash up. Comes with 7 factions in the box and I've always been a fan of the 40k universe so the choice is great. Can run longer than the 45 with new players but still a great game.

Brilliant game design. From the back and forth deploy phase, the guessing game of command struggles, and the hand and action management of combat, this game shines and has got me back into two player card games in a big way. It has even sucked me into the aspect of deckbuilding which I wasn't really a fan of in the past.

RATING: 8
Wow.  Despite being into 40K since the 80's I was probably going to give this a pass.  i wasn't really eager to start yet another LCG, and I had recently bought into Doomtown.  But then I read the initial reports from Gencon and I decided to buy one core set when it came out.  Yeah, later that same day I drove back to the store to get two more.  his game is pretty awesome.

I find it really captures the flavor of the 40K galaxy.  The gameplay is really, really interesting.  You get to start with enough resources to do what you want to do, and your hand stays flush with cards.  The alternating play sequence keeps you engaged all along.  The game seems to escalate from small skirmishes into one big epic game deciding battle at the end.

The game presents a lot of interesting tactical decisions and the different factions offer a variety of play - the base set card pool is so thinly stretched as to make deck building almost impossible but this is (slowly) resolving itself as more expansions arrive.  The different faction match-ups require flexibility in play as does which planets are in play, and in which order.

Thematically there are a couple of quibbles, the main one being that the game's units and actions are essentially tactical - individual squads and personalities and weapons - yet the game is played strategically across different planets. This doesn't mean the game itself is bad, but for the sake of immersion I like the story the game tells to make some logical sense.

A couple of other plusses - the card artwork is very good and the rule book approach is excellent - a learn the game tutorial rule book and a separate reference guide - other games look and learn. Who'da thought it - a good FFG rulebook. 

FFG should still sell base set supplements to bring all cards up to the max count and until they do I will continue to regard them as part of the unacceptable face of capitalism and evil.

I really liked the game but the LCG nature doesn't appeal. And two player games don't get played. And two player cardgames that take dedication to really learn the cards to find synergies and interactions...Well, that's just not happening around these parts for me. But that said, the game itself is pretty damn solid and I do like it a lot. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
probably the best FFG inhouse designed LCG largely because the resource cards are central and you can read their effects easily. The Battline core engine works well as always. Still FFG seem to have this need to give almost every damn card some special effect text. I quite liked it, things don't get too crowded or confusing and the factions in the base box work well on a mechanical level. The alliance wheel is a bit dumb though.

Very interesting LCG. Rules are not so difficult to learn but mastering the game will be difficult. I really like the planets with ressources mechanic and the bluff with the commander phase. In my opinion, this is a great LCG.

This game has a somewhat disapponting base set. Certainly not up to the standards of recent ones like Star Wars or Android: Netrunner. However, the first cycle of cards presents a lot of interesting new options and is a great addition.

Shame about the licensing issues here. Unfortunately, there's not enough of a game, nor enough players, to really justify owning this one, I think.

Interesting card game where each of the factions plays very differently, Orcs are big and uggy. Orc SMASH! Eldar are tweaky and can run away easily. Guards have a numbers advantage. Really interesting! I am looking forward to the first couple of intro packs so I can customise some decks.

RATING: 8
This is a VERY thematic game. Combat is brutal, with lots of casualties. Definitely a "claw your way to victory" game. And couple of us are in the process of building WH40K tabletop armies, so it's nice to have a 40K game we'll actually play while we dork out with that.

Deck-building is something I'm always going to find challenging, but I was able to put together a pretty good one just browsing through a friend's cards. Right now, I'm building several decks, which I will probably overthink and lose badly with. 

Of course, I'm saddened by the end of the FFG/GW partnership, but I'm going to grab as much stuff as I can while I can still find it, and my friends and I should be all set.

I love the 40k lore but never wanted to get in to miniatures or the RPGs. Mage Wars replaced Magic for me and this will replace Mage Wars. I love having a leader for my deck on the field and having unit location matter. For me this beats Mage Wars as MW had too many key words and rules to remember and a play time which was a bit too long for my tastes.
I can't wait for the warpacks and expansions!

Love this game! Simple to learn and teach, but could take a lifetime to master. It finds the right balance between simplicity and depth. A lot of the low ratings I saw attributed their ratings because of the extreme swings and just snowball feel. I thought so too until 1) I missed an important rule about units coming from the HQ to a planet come tapped. Plus good strategy and planning for future rounds beat that snowball effect. Seriously dive into this game, play with each faction, once you get a good feel for this game, you won't want to put it down if you are a fan of card games, etc.

Eric Lang and de FFG devs have nailed it. The game is fast with a low learning curve and a great WH40K feeling. The round flow of the game (making a difference with the others " my turn\your turn" games) accomplishes the ever changing waves of a battle and push the players to be intuitious and make versatile plannings. 
An 8, by now. I have a really good feeling with this one

Can't quite put a finger on why the game feels clunky. And sometimes feels like you're bulldozing the opponent by just bringing your massive army you build up with your warlord.

Alex really wanted this. So I eventually bought it. Ends in 7 rounds, or sooner. An LCG game that comes with like 5 or 7 factions. Needs more cards for each faction. Lots of reading on the cards and the interactions with other cards both on your side and your opponent. Alex usually wins, but I have won at least once. A lot of looking up rules and special terms in the two rule books. Another similiar game to Chtuhlu LCG.

WH40K: Conquest is an engaging, highly tactical game with plenty to enjoy. The turn structure presents players with a range of choices, the order and timing of which are critical. The combat system is the heart of the game, and the decisions here are rich and very satisfying. The struggle for planets is tense, and players must execute their plans precisely; one minor misstep could spell defeat. The various factions play quite differently, providing thematic variety and repeat playability. This is a remarkably well-designed card game, and is the only LCG I have played that grabbed me.

Like Diskwars, Conquest is a Warhammer-themed, intensely tactical game with multiple factions and innumerable effects and abilities, and a side of randomness from card draws rather than die rolling. There's also strategic weight to your moves: it's not exactly a skirmish like Magic where you'd play a succession of duels, but a campaign game that can take up to two hours. As usual with FFG, the production is good with great art, sturdy tokens and a useful reference guide, but the composition of the card selection has its ups and downs. On the one hand, the inclusion of several decks seems to offer plenty of replayability; on the other hand, none of them has enough cards to be tournament legal by itself, pushing you to buy an additional copy and/or expansions. There should probably be some kind of "just enough stuff to fill out your decks" pack.

[2016.Jan.5] Like all CCGs/LCGs, luck-of-the-draw and power cards (...and oh, some are real doozies...) can make some games too lopsided. (Sigh.) That said, it is still a fun game & I am very glad to have experienced playing it.

[2015.Jan.2] An instant classic in my opinion. This game scratches many itches all at once: area control, bluffing, resource management, etc. While it does suffer from typical CCG/LCG-like issues (which card-flopping game doesn't?), its positives outweigh any such negatives by a mile wide margin. One personal criticism is that following the innovation that [i]Star Wars: The Card Game[/i] brought to deck construction, any LCG where I have to build a deck card-by-card is simply lesser. Gaming time is a precious commodity, I'd rather use it for playing than prepping. All that said, however, this game is superb. Eric Lang's LCGs keep getting better and better.

[2014.Nov.2] (Tentative rating after a handful of plays.)

Cons:

RATING: 9
The localized battles and command struggles really set this apart from other constructed deck games. Dramatic swings and tension-filled turns are featured in nearly all of our games. Every game is a story. Tough decisions are found in both playing and deck building.

The 7 seven factions (soon to be 9) are nuanced and fully fleshed out due to 25+ years worth of background material.

This game is in god-mode.

Update: I'm not loving where the expansion cycles are headed. Too many conditionals are shifting the outcomes away from players' in-game choices and towards lucky alignment with the initial planet flop.

RATING: 9
Play and manipulate cards to conquer the Traxis sector.

Plays: More than 50.
Type: Thematic area control game = a theme-driven game where you compete for control of areas. Deck building pre-game.
Complexity: Medium strategy game.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 45-60 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict and competition for scarce resources.
Randomness: Low – cards, but you decide what cards go in your deck.

Replayability: Very high. The game play has depth to explore. The assymetrical factions beg for repeat plays to explore all the different strategies. Even with the same faction, deck-building lets you keep tweaking your deck to improve it. In-game decisions are interesting and tense.
Fun: Average. This is a tense game, where every little decision matters. The fun lies in outplaying your opponent. It’s a bit like playing poker, where you’re trying to lure your opponent into playing hands where you have the advantage. If you enjoy this kind of tension it’s fun, otherwise probably not so much.
Memorability: Low, for a thematic game. You won’t remember individual games, but rather the overall feel of each deck that you play. 

Thematic integration: Very good. This is designed theme first. I enjoy the WH40K over the top-cheesy setting, so this is a big hit for me. The theme really shines through game play, so if you don’t like it, probably best to stay away.
Components: Good. Fantasy Flight does not disappoint. Cards and tokens are high quality. I think the art isn’t as completely awesome as LotR:LCG, but it’s good.

Who will like this: Gamers that enjoy the theme, enjoy deck building and want a tense direct conflict game for two.

Very very good, both [b]tactic[/b] (attack order? ability to trigger?) and [b]strategy[/b] (where to invest the troops for the fight, and where for the command struggle? where can I send my Warlord - and where HE will send HIS warlord? Will I move all my units in the HQ to the 2nd planet and leave them there, ready for the next turn, or I'll bring the punch to conquest the 1st planet?) are needed to win.

Yes there are cards, so luck is there, but with 7/8 cards drawn at the beginning and a lot of resources to start with, you can hardly blame the dry fate (more probably it's a deckbuilding problem!)

A summer surprise. Very good fantasy card wargame: not incredibly innovative, but rock-solid and FUN.

Hey, plus the theme (and the visual) truly shines: if you love the WH40K lore, or even if you're remotely interested in it, and you're not afraid of the LCG format, this is a no-brainer.

Nach Warhammer: Invasion, welches in der Fantasy Variante von Warhammer angesiedelt war, gibt es nun mit Warhammer: Conquest auch eine 40k Variante. Dabei ist nicht nur das Setting unterschiedlich, sondern auch der ganze Spielablauf. In Conquest gilt es Planeten zu erobern und dadurch Ressourcen zu bekommen. Da man nicht unendlich Truppen zur Verfügung hat, muss man sich taktisch genau überlegen, welchen Planeten man für wertvoll erachtet. Die Spielmechaniken sind durchaus komplex und brauchen eine Weile, bis sie in Fleisch und Blut übergegangen sind. Das Balancing der unterschiedlichen Fraktionen benötigt noch etwas Feinschliff. Das Artwork der Karten ist mal wieder fantastisch.

Feels very similar to Smash Up, in a lot of ways, but I had a hard time getting invested in this. Games are over and done with very quickly, so it doesn't really feel like you're fighting over the galaxy or anything. I found the game fine, but the fact that it was over so quickly, and before you got to utilize most of your deck, left a bad taste in my mouth.

Would rather play Smash Up or the High Command Deck Builders.

Another variation on the Star Wars/Game of Thrones LCG, if I'd come to this first I might have been impressed.  But the theme isn't that appealing for me and the variations from the aforementioned games are not interesting enough for me to want to play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent next generation LCG that includes more tactical decision making than predecessors.  The purchase phase allows each player to alternate paying for and placing a character at one of five different planets, each with different levels of boons in terms of card draws, cash, and a special power.  Characters are differentiated by the damage they can do, how resilient they are in combat, their ability to obtain the boons at the planet, and often a special capability.  Once both sides pass, each player simultaneously selects which planet their leader will be placed.  Because of this, there is a greater sense of mobility in Conquest than in other LCGs.  Also some cards can be used instead to soak up damage in combat, leading to interesting in battle decisions.  Victory can either come from conquering the right combination of planets, or by eliminating your opponent's leader.  Sadly out of print now, it would have benefitted by having expansions add to the 10 planets that come in the base set.

If I hadn't played 40K for so long, I probably wouldn't like this game as much.

The customization and ability to change your army around brings me back to my warhammer days, just with a lot less glue and paint. They did a wonderful job making each army feel like it does when you are actually playing the miniatures version. My eldar army is every bit as the expensive, fragile, mobile army of specialists that dies all to quickly if you use them poorly.

While more of a poker match than a tactical dice chucker as Warhammer 40K is, it still feels like I'm playing with miniatures.

Un très bon JCE avec un thème qui me plait beaucoup.
Je n'ai pas encore testé ou rencontré toutes les races mais le peu que j'ai vu (Chaos vs Tau) me parait plein de potentiel.
Les règles sont relativement simples mêmes si certains points méritent éclaircissement.
Je n'ai fait qu'une partie où j'ai vraiment lutté pour avoir des ressources car mes bestioles coûtent cher et je pense que je suis un peu passé à côté de la spécialisation de la race que j'ai joué (Chaos). J'aimerai bien y rejouer pour me faire une opinion plus mûre.
Par contre ce qui est pas sympa c'est que le jeu et ses extensions ne seraient plus développés suite à des problèmes d'éditeurs (FFG et GWS)
Pour le moment je lui met 7, j'attend de voir les autres races pour remonter la note ^^

RATING: 9
100+ plays. It's a game laden with strategy. I'm not a classic-style deckbuilder, so I like the restrictiveness of having to choose one faction based on my preferred play style and what I'd like to explore/try, and then choose cards from that one faction and only one of its two ally factions - that keeps things sane for me. There are hard choices about how much to dedicate to command (bonus cards and resources) and how many battle-winning troops to include - it's useless winning command if you can't win battles, and you won't win too many battles without winning some command bonuses. Once you're up and playing, you're faced with further hard strategic choices about where to place your units - at the first planet to battle for it, or to setup on later planets which give long term benefits. Deployment turns alternate a unit at a time, so there's some cat and mouse here. Combat is fairly brutal - there's lots of death as befitting the theme, but the outcome is often not clear given players can shield units with cards from the hand, play events, ambush new units in, etc. Which creates some nice cheer/groan satisfaction moments when a nicely constructed plan of surprise pays off. The game features lots of card draw and plenty of resources, allowing for lots of choice on how to spend those resources. All in all, there's a ton of play-style variability in the game, leading to lots of replayability. I've been happy exploring its depths.

I could definitely see the potential in this game and it almost felt like a more complex version of Blood Bowl: TM. I liked how the factions bled into each other and the complexities of the game. 

The two biggest things that threw me off was that cards would target anywhere instead of just the current fight and that the term "action" had certain windows of when they would go off or were allowed to go off.

Not a game I plan on buying, but if I was handed a crafted deck, I would play it again. The rating will either rise a point or drop a point depending on how the next few plays go.

"Want to play Conquest?"

YES!!

My favorite game of all time to date! I've collected wh40k miniatures as a youngster, so I've grown to love the grim universe with all the super cool armies. The miniature wargame itself actually is not that great imo, but the armybuilding and painting etc. is what really captivated me and made us best friends forevever.

With Conquest I have the lore and "prepainted miniatures" in the form of cards, in one neat little package. And the gameplay.. oh my god! Being a card game there is always an element of luck, but never have I felt like losing due to a bad luck. Either the deck I've consturcetd is poor, or doesn't compare well against the opposing warlord, or the opponent has been outright superior player. This is a game of skill and requires one or more like-minded fellas who will dedicate a good amount of their time creating decks and practising with different warlords. Other than that the better player will mostly win and the experience might be a bit sour for the opponent.

This game pits you against important decisions all the way, and even the slightest of mistakes or timing mis-evaluation can lead to a battle lost. You need to do your best all the time!

This game has been cancelled now that ffg and games workshop divorced, so I highly recommend to grap a copy of this game (3x Core Sets and all the expansions) so you don't miss out on a fabolous game! There is a steep(ish) learning curve, but do yourself a favor and get through the first 10-20 games and start enjoying the ride after you delve deeper into the mechanics.

If I'd have to give some critique, then I will say that with it's large card pool there is a few weird and counterintuitive card interactions, but you can find rules answers to all of these on cardgamedb's forums (as long as they exist). Otherwise you can always houserule them with a consensus with your opponent.

I repeat, this is my favorite game of all time!

15-06-2015. Rated after 3 plays or something. Sadly disappointing LCG. To me, it felt like the one I liked least of the ones out so far.

In WHQ you have a warlord and a deck of cards. In the middle of the table there are 5 of 7 planets. You win the game if you kill your opponent's warlord, get 3 of the same kind of symbols on the planets or your opponent runs out of cards.

The game begins with a summon phase, in which you play cards to the planets. Then, you commit your warlord to a planet by rotating a secret dial. You subsequently get income (cards and resources) by seeing who controls most 'command' at each planet, getting cards or resources as depicted.

Subsequently you start combat at each planet where there is a warlord in addition to the first planet in line which you always battle at. Combat is simple,  you basically tap a creature to damage one of your opponents' creatures or warlord if present.. This continues untill all creatures are tapped, then, both players get the chance to withdraw. If not, the combat continues for another round. If you retreat, you move your cards back to your HQ to be reassigned to combat the next round (creatures move with overlord to planet but are exhausted when they arrive).

The game is interesting and fun but felt too simplistic for my tastes. An LCG must be something special and I feel that both Netrunner and StarWars are better. So unless you really, really enjoy WH universe I'd say try one of those.

Underrated game. Sad FFG did such a poor job of securing a long contract before picking this theme. 

:) 9 Unique factions
:) Genius movement mechanic
:) Really good artwork
:) Lots to think about, but simple ruleset
:) Resource system just as important as combat

Another excellent LCG from Fantasy Flight. Very different from any other FF card game I've played. It is an excellent way to experience the Warhammer 40K Universe without having to buy into the pricey, complicated miniatures game. You can buy all the factions for this game for the price of one faction of the miniatures game. A very satisfying card game and one that I enjoy playing whenever I can. Deck building is fun for this game too!

The game itself was fun.  It really felt like a simplified, card version of playing 40K.  I can really only speak of the Eldar, which is my race of choice in this and the miniature version.  The abilities of my cards to move around so fast really gave me the feeling that I was playing the Eldar.  I loved it.

If they would make expansion packs by the races, instead of including a little of everything in each pack it would be much better.  As an Eldar player, I felt that I had to buy every pack in order to get access to every Eldar card.

As a player who only enjoys certain races, this was very frustrating for me and ultimately why I got rid of the game.

I didn't have high hopes for this one, after the other Warhammer themed games I've played lately. This one, however, got me interested. I've even been thinking about it afterwards. I like how there are battles for control of several locations, while one is significantly more important than the others - leading to some meaty decisions. I like how the combat is not random, but still kept very interesting through timing, hidden information and simultaneous selection. I then realized Nate French had his name on the box. Good game.

Disclaimer: I have no interest in Conquest as a competitive tournament game. Much like how I play GoT, I like the game as a series of pre-built decks that can be relatively balanced against each other.

So, removing that how well does it work? Pretty well actually. I suspect that it'll be a year or two before we really know which decks work in their current build but the game plays quickly and smoothly enough that I don't mind.

Minus points for the GW theme though; I actively dislike almost all of it.

I've never played a Warhammer game before, so the theme is lost on me.  But, the game play is pretty slick.  I like how you are battling over different planets and you can choose which ones you want to fight at.  I only played one game, so I'm only scratching the surface of strategy.

RATING: 10
Very deep game.  Multiple victory conditions. Great theme, great artwork.  Easy to learn, plays smoothly.

I am a fan of table top games (40k 3rd-5th ed., Warmachine/Hordes, X-wing, WoW minis, etc.) and a fan of CCG's (WoW TCG, Young Jedi, StarWars, StarTrek, Galactic Empires, etc.), this game has elements from both.

The initial planet lay out is like the battlefield from a tabletop and directly affects your decisions when trying to execute your deck's strategy.  The card draw/resource mechanic is a well thought out, tested and implemented system.  The combat is non-random, (ie. no dice) like many CCGs, which means a player's SKILL, in battle preparation and attack order, will determine the winner.

A+ Solid all around.

Played twice and I was filled with analysis paralysis. I found it deep and crunchy...a bit too much for my tastes but that could very well be because of my inexperience. This has a fair amount of potential and my rating of this could increase if I get more plays in this year...
Now I've played 10 times. It's still a bit too brain-burning for me but I haven't had anybody that wanted to play anything with me so bought some cards to play vs my son in his favorite game also in part because I enjoy deck building.
5/13/17: I've now played 30 times. This game is really really good.  I still take lots and lots of losses and it still burns my brain at times but at the end of the day it is very strategic, thematic and SO satisfying.

RATING: 6
On the plus side, Warhammer 40,000: Conquest is quick, quick, quick. Other strengths are crisp, clear rules and plenty of variety, with seven different factions that do play very differently. The downside is that the simple victory conditions can make for some very lopsided games. Getting a bad opening hand and losing a planet with three symbols in the first round pretty much means game over. To a lesser extent, any slow start means an uphill battle given how quickly victory can come for the other side. Even in close games, strategy and tactics usually devolve into a single, giant battle at one key planet. Those battles can be cool, but it negates a lot of tactical options ... you gotta jam units onto that key planet or lose. To a greater or lesser extent I like all of Fantasy Flight's Living Card Games, and this one is no exception ... I'll happily play this again. But it just doesn't stand out from the crowd for me.

Excellent, blisteringly fast paced game. Very simple rules and easy to teach to new players. However this does not detract from the depth of play afforded by the variety on the cards, which is already very impressive. This will only improve and grow as more and more expansion packs are released.

It's a bit of a downer to have to buy three copies of the core set in order to build the best decks (for which I'm marking it down a couple of points). I suppose this isn't necessary unless you want to compete in tournaments. Purely down to the quality of the game, I have to admit that I went back to the shop a week after buying a copy to purchase another two, so I guess that gives it my seal of approval.

Good stuff!

Liking it so far and it seems to have a lot of potential. Probably won't replace Netrruner as my go-to LCG, though.

The gameplay is very similar to one of my favorite board games, Blood Bowl: Team Manager. Except this removes most of the randomness (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on player preference) and of course adds the expandable LCG model on top of everything. You've got to fight for your resources and card draws, and having two ways to win means you have to balance your strategy between attacking planets and dealing damage to your opponent's warlord. Good stuff. I just hope they can maintain balance between all nine factions throughout the whole game cycle.

I was so hyped for this game and even though I didn't have any other players to frequently play it with, I got the core set 2 times, the first cycle and the first big expansion box because the whole game mechanic felt so awesome.

You fight over a couple of planets in the hope to win them. Each planet has some icons and you need to have a 3 of the same icons on various planets won to win the match. There are 7 planets total in play (if I recall correctly) and each turn the first planet (if not won by a player) will be discarded, meaning the game will always finish in a max of 7 turns.

You need to spread out your forces, build some structures in your headquarters and manage resources. You got a Commander with his squad that already points your deck towards a certain playstyle, which feels pretty unique and interesting.

Too bad FFG and Games Workshop broke up. :(

Played constructed with no faction mixing using a friend's starter and the first two expansions.  I will never view this game under a competitive/tournament lense, and am interested in seeing how well customization will work after 5-6 expansions, and played with in faction cards only.  My viewpoint is to evaluated this LCG as a customizable and expandable board game.

40K Conquest gameplay feels like a mix of Legend of Five Rings and Call of Cthulhu.  The resource mechanic is streamlined to the point of being virtually transparent (no "land" mechanic to pay for stuff).  This is an excellent feature that is hopefully the trend of future card game designs.  

I am holding off on a rating until I play more games.

EDIT: Why did I compare this to Talisman when RELIC is it's look-a-like?!  o_o  ...I was very sleepy...

As a 40k fan that could never afford 40k miniatures, this is a dream come true.

However I do realize its stark contrast to my Talisman review so as a quick clarification.

This game comes with 7 starter decks.
That game comes with 4 characters.

This game was $35
That game is $60

This game feels like a full game out of the box (like Netrunner)
That game doesn't (feels like a game by EA, you can almost hear the proverbial chop-shop)

Good, but not great.  I like that there are several different decks in the game box, and this is pretty interesting to play as far as LCGs go.  The now-or-later mechanic for planet contesting leads to some interesting strategy, and the decision of where to put your warlord leads to some nailbiting decisions when you try to guess what your opponent will do.  The biggest drawback is that it isn't different enough from all the other FFG LCGs that are out there.  It's another entry in an already crowded genre, and I can't see myself playing this that often.  LCGs are beginning to feel like Euros with their insistence on repeating the same mechanics over and over in slightly different combinations.

I mean, it's not *bad*, but it's essentially a beefier version of Blood Bowl Team Manager with a few other mechanisms mixed in. It's fine, but it's nothing groundbreaking, and a CCG/LCG really needs to offer me something more if I'm going to buy in.

August 22, 2014 - Let me get this out of the way: I'm not looking for another card game with monthly packs—between Netrunner and Lord of the Rings, I already tithe enough to Fantasy Flight. Another admission: my only play is with incorrect rules and I'm pretty sure it earned me a rather rough loss. However, I'm still interested in trying the game again at some point and I want to see if I like it any better, but I doubt I'll be going any further than trying out my friend's base set. 

[hr]
September 9, 2014 - After playing the game a second time, it's grown on me a bit. I'm starting to see combos and we got a lot of rules wrong (battles only take place at the first planet and where the warlords are, armies only come back if they were at the first planet, armies go with the warlord exhausted). After fixing those rules, there's definitely a good game here. 

However, my problem still stands: when will I get to play this game when I dedicate a lot of energy to Netrunner? The games are similar enough and I've got a lot of time, money, and energy invested into Netrunner.

RATING: N/A
Two Warlords engage in a living card game battle for majority control of the planets displayed in the central tableau called the Traxis sector. Seven distinct Warhammer factions to choose from.  Decks consist of events (spells), units, support (artifacts), and attachments (enchantments). Spend resources to deploy units on starting planets, use a selection wheel to assign the warlord (I love selection wheels). Combat, tap to exhaust and retreat if desired. Claimed planets have special benefits. As with most deck based card games, random draw will cause the dreaded "mana hose". In the event of a tie, last planet wins.

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1221109/my-sizable-review-w40k-conquest-eagerly-awaited-do

Another commenter (if you look up the game's comments) made the incorrect claim that random draw causes mana hosing which isn't factual for this game.  Everyone gets a set amount of Resources and Card Draw during the Headquarters (end-phase).  Plus, players can always net a few extra resources and/or cards to draw during the Command Phase turn. So yeah, not correct.

I've played several more games since my first comments and I've gone back in here to edit these in order to add just how much I'm really, REALLY enjoying this game.  A must-buy if you love the setting, card games, or both.

Az eddig kipróbált FFG-s LCG-k közül (aGoT, LotR, Arkham) ez tetszett a legkevésbé. Hozzáteszem gyorsan, h semmi közöm a Warhammerhez, így a téma semennyire nem vonzott, valamint a lapok rajzai sem dobogtatták meg így a szívem. Ráadásul egy próbajáték ment le eddig, egy esélyt majd adok még neki vmikor.

3 játék után semennyire nem mozdult el a dolog a holtpontról nálam. Az egységek bolygóra mozgatása (warlorddal) kifejezetten béna, meg nagyon taktikázni se lehet az egészben.

First impressions : Didn't had high expectations for the game but was pleasantly surprised. It's a very clever game. Good amount of strategic choices, much better use of locations than the CoC lcg. Much deeper and less luck involved than Bloodbowl the cardgame. Hard decision between long term spreading out or short term concentration. 

Some things standing out compared to other ccg’s that I like : 
* the back and forth gameplay-style. Not player A puts everything in play, then B, but you do an action, I do an action. Less AP, more reaction based, feels more fluently 
* resources can be banked, unlimited handsize, so you can strategize and save those resources in the long term, leads to more planning
* The Command phase : You’ve got to actively do something for your resources, not draw them from the deck 
* Warlord and his unique squad allow for more various styles in faction 

After some deep exploration of the cards and strategies in the Warlord cycle : this is truly a great cardgame. It's exquisite in the strategy department with a lot of small nuances and clever plays. Love it ! Big positive : balance between the warlords is very good and they all have a unique playstyle. Biggest negative : elites and big units get punished by high cost curve and hard removal. 

After more than 65 games : has definitely become my favourite LCG. Lots of moments where using strategic thinking, optimal use of planet spread/abilities and tactical play of cards made for a comeback on a lost position. The second warlord cycle sees a nudge towards bigger units and elites, a concern I had in the first cycle. A good amount of lesser  and mediocre cards from the previous packs become more interesting to play, such as eldar vehicles, so that’s a good sign that developers are on the right track. I also noticed unexperienced (but also longer term) players making a lot of mistakes against the rules, timing windows and with interaction between cards, so it’s definitely a game with a higher learning curve.

Will need additional plays before deciding on a rating but I can already say that I'm really enjoying the mix of several other CCGs' elements.
The phase where you secretly decide where you'll be sending your warlord makes for interesting mindgames.

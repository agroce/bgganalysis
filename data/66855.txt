I had to lower my rating once it became evident that the game is hopelessly broken.  At least I can play it solitaire and try to play not by what the rules allow, but by what would be historical and watch it unfold.  Because there is no hidden information, this is possible.

Within those limited confines, this game has a lot of great ideas built into the chit pull.  Of course, it's Ted Racier, so you are going to be straight-jacketed into a LOT of limitations and exceptions.  Just be sure to download the fan-created player aids in the BGG-files section.

I would like to know how many of the players who gave a 9 or 10 to this game played a complete campaign game. Because I agree with them, the Barbarossa scenario is a 10, it's where the game shines. But then, it becomes boring until summer 1944, where the Russian have the power to strike. In between, in our game we saw no combat for 3 years north of Orel: the Germans are happy enough to stay where they are, the Russians attack at half strength (Zhukov and Stavka were needed in the south, where most of game was played, to recover the terrain lost). South of Orel there was a slow Russian advance from Stalingrad to Kiev, with a lot of BL results and one hex retreats by the Germans. The German panzer divisions can just stack around 20 SPs in one hex, so that their counterattacks usually end in BL results against the powerful guard armies (I managed to destroy one of them cutting the retreat path but it was just a 1/3 chance): not so interesting, again.

Excellent east front game. Very large but straightforward rules. Allow 2 hours per turn for the summer turns. Chit pull initiative system works well and suits solo play. Captures the feel of the changing nature of the east front well.

The Dark Valley is a very playable semi-monster. It might possibly be THE ONE WWII East Front game.

It seems to me that the learning curve is tilted pretty strongly against the Germans. Winning with the Wehrmacht should be an interesting puzzle, specially on the Barbarossa scenario. I'm thinking about auctioning off negative VPs at the start of the game to allow a player to start with the Soviet Union: The player who forfeits more VPs starts with USSR. At least until my buddy and I figure out how not to die with Germany.

I really like the fact that the mechanics is based on the chit-pull system. It really improves the experience, adding uncertainty to the planning process and putting some value on your improvisation abilities. It also makes for a really enjoyable solo experience.

Monster.
Dos mapas y una cantidad generosa de counters, aunque aún dentro de lo manejable.
El arte gráfico y los componentes son correctos, personalmente el diseño del mapa me gusta.

A favor

- Las reglas son moderadamente asequibles aunque tienen su enjundia (pequeñas excepciones propensas al olvido y que afectan de forma importante al desarrollo de la partida). 

- El juego es desafiante y con bastante profundidad. El alemán tiene ante sí una labor titánica al comienzo de la campaña. Cada movimiento cuenta y hay que sacar el mayor provecho de él. 

- La mecánica de extracción de chits es divertida y original, pero solo al principio de la campaña. Luego es mucho menos importante.

- Tiene el chrome justo. En un juego de este tamaño, haber aplicado un exceso de detalle lo podría haber hecho injugable.

En contra

- Como Alemán durante la campaña uno se puede sentir un poco frustrado pq por mucho que se optimice cada counter, no se llega a todo.

- El orden de los chits influye MUCHO al principio, pero pierde frescura a partir de 1942. Después del primer año se convierte en en una mecánica demasiado plana e incluso irrelevante una vez las líneas de frente están firmemente montadas.

- La campaña es muy larga. Los primeros turnos necesitan muchas horas para completarse pq tienen muchas activaciones. Los años intermedios son muy aburridos ya que las mecánicas te imponen unas restricciones que evitan grades movimientos. Esto enlentece mucho la partida y lo convierte en muy monótono.

- La campaña tiene toda la pinta de no haber sido testeada correctamente. Después de Barbarroja faltan motivaciones para que el alemán ataque en lugar de asentarse y esperar el paso del tiempo. Lo veo más un juego de escenarios que de campaña sin ninguna duda.

- Hay reglas que rechinan un poco. Los reeplazos alemanes por ejemplo y los objetivos de campaña teutones de 1942.

- La regla de muerte súbita para el Alemán de 29 puntos en invierno de 1941 es irreal e injusta. En general las condiciones de victoria podrían estar mejor pensadas.

- Hay algunas erratas en manual y counters. No son muy importantes pero hay que considerarlas.

- Sin duda lo veo un juego más para Vassal más que para presencial. Demasiado conteo de factores y optimización para jugarlo en vivo. El otro jugador se aburre mucho si quieres optimizar tu jugada.

   
Tras jugar la campaña hasta 1943 ha bajado mucho mi valoración sobre el juego. La parte central de la misma se convierte en muy aburrida y poco móvil. La mecánica de chits se desinfla y fluye muy lentamente con 2 frentes desgastándose en turnos muy repetitivos. El escenario de Barbarroja es correcto pero si se continua el juego peca de falta de testeo como casi todos los monsters.

Initial Impression: Wow! This is the Eastern Front game that I never realized I was looking for. This game has been described as a "playable mini-monster" game. I concur with that description. The game encompasses many of the decisions of the Eastern Front without bogging down with rules and mechanisms. Although supply is essential, it's not the focal point of the game and has been abstracted to a playable form. Similarly with the aerial support/supply. The use of the chit-pull mechanism in this game is pure brilliance, allowing for uncertainty with respect to command and control. As well, the chit-pull allows players to only have to focus on a few units at a time. That, and the simple rules breaks the monster down into playable bite-size chunks. After having packed the game away, it still haunts my mind. I'll be bringing it to the table again soon.

Beautiful and playable game in the old classics tradition.  Streamlined play, straightforward rules, and interesting mechanics.  Modified chit pull makes it a superb solo experience.  (I've slightly downgraded this to a nine--not much, I know, and I still really enjoy the game, but I am kind of frustrated at the number of small but important rules, etc... that I keep forgetting!  My memory is at fault, I realize, but there are a lot of early turn exceptions and special rules, and a really well-designed player aid card could help a lot here.  Ted has posted one, but it feels like a rough draft to me.  Nonetheless, this is a great game!)

Update: Removing my 1 rating, because Ted himself got censored on CSW and then left the site in a huff.  Hopefully he's learned his lesson about how odious censorship of legitimate opinions is.

Update: Giving a 1 now that I saw Ted Raicer threatening to censor someone who criticized a facet of the game on Consimworld.  Seems like Ted's ego has really gotten out of control. Sad.

Positive comments for this game seem to all come from solitaire gamers or the kind of people who are impressed by just graphics or cool sounding rules.  Insightful commentary from serious players who gave it a real go indicate the game has serious flaws with no overrun rule/double or triple line defenses, Germans too weak, tedious mid war, air units that can destroy entire corps in the rear with bombardment, bizarre CRTs etc.  Over 6,400 posts on Consimworld, only 50 of them from 2016,  and the P500 effort has fallen flat for a reprint. Seems abandoned by serious gamers. Sadly the game sounds like yet another turd.  If it was smaller, faster and not riddled with errata and exceptions I might try it, but as it is - Sold.  I have been burned by games with lots of weak units and no overrun rule before.  Never again.

EF games are always on my radar and I love chit pull.  And to be honest, if it wasn't chit pull based, I wouldn't even be considering it as the design has warning flags in SPADES: Racier design, GMT "development", Mahaffey map.

And it's not the chit pull that we know and love, rather it's a rather unique approach, similar to the STAVKA chit in AVL, a movement chit allows ALL units to move, an attack chit allows ALL units to attack, and the like, This is not activation by formation, it's activation of all units by function.  There's other oddities too: units do not have ZOCs, except for those that do of course.  It wouldn't be a Racier design without bizarre exceptions.  Supply is judged at random times by chit draw, in the same manner that gamers hated in AVD.  Hexes seem too small perhaps because the map covers unnecessary geography, again a Racier EF hallmark.

Some people love Ted's work, but I can't count myself as one of them.  I'll wait for reviews by trusted sources before I decide if this is worth adding to my already full shelves.  Sadly, I doubt it will be.

Another try of Ted Raicer to crack good Eastern Front game. Interesting scale and mechanics, average written rules. It's semi-monster but plays smoothly with high solitaire rating.
BUT fails to achieve its target, because it is too much programmed in terms of chits availiability. It shows, that designer have not definite "feel" of Eastern Front struggle. Chits Move/Combat did not works with hundred miles front, when some of units fight and some moves SIMULTANEOUSLY.
Another factor is unbalanced Barbarossa and Campaign scenario, which ends in January 1942 in first Victory check. There is no chance to win as a Germans without changing VP's value.
BUT there is a second, good aspect - Dark Valley shows in decent form how big gamble was Barbarossa itself.

Ted Racier's attempt at his definitive Great Patriotic war-game.  Haven't played yet but like other Racier games and chit pull mechanic for East front makes for some interesting variety to plan.i.e not stuck with standard direction of campaign as found in other games.  Might be wisest choice, but leaves options which is one of the aspect I enjoy with well designed simulations.  What else could the commander have tried, and why didn't he?

Really wanted to enjoy this game from Ted.  Enjoyed the opening moves of massive German breakthroughs but then the Russian masses of 1-4 units made it extremely expensive for the large powerful German units to get an EXCHANGE no matter what the odds. Think the large German units should be able to over run the tiny 1-4 without, or with an extremely small chance of loss.  In our second game I, as the German, am working hard to avoid battle, even at odds of 30 to 1, so I will not have my large panzer units take a step lose with exchange.  The German desire is to avoid battle from 1942 on to save the army to fall back slowly and win by avoiding the Russian capture of victory hexes. Not fun.

Very clever design which highlights the big encirclement battles of the summer and fall 1941.

The Red army is obliged to make usually doomed counter-attacks planned by the Stavka.

My only reproach would be about the map and counters art. I would have prefered the usual brown color for the soviet units. I try to like the map art but I don't succeed in it...

One of the few Eastern Front games I've played that really gets the flow of the campaign right in 1941 - the Soviets get blown away almost wherever they defend, but still have the teeth to counterattack.  The action chits do a GREAT job of modeling the changing command effectiveness in the opposing armies.

Near perfect game. It greatly benefits from the documents created by the community in BGG (special rules per turn, etc), and from the Vassal module (use the one on VASSAL's website, not the one on GMT's website). Can't complain about the rules, they are much clearer / shorter than in Red Star Rising for example ; however there is plenty of chrome rules that you won't remember while playing. Set-up information could be more detailed (at least in the Barbarossa scenario). It would have been great to have the weather-related DMs with the weather table on the map, as well as the cost of movement per type of terrain with the map keys, as I like to have all these info on the map rather than on player aids.

Current rating is based only on the Barbarossa & Fall Blau scenarii.

FINALLY A RUSSIAN FRONT GAME WHERE MINSK CAN FALL ON THE FIRST TURN AS IT DID HISTORICALLY!

Raicer is to be commended here. This is a throwback design in many ways, but one that feels not so much fresh as different from the rest of the pack. I noted that Minsk can fall on turn one. In addition the game encourages the creation of pockets. I do wish a few things were not so scripted but that might be asking too much. As it is this is the playable monster on the Eastern Front. Now when can we get scenarios for Typhoon, Uranus/Mars/Saturn, Korsun, Budapest, and Vistula 1945?

Lastly, no SS Charlemagne or Nordland but plenty of Tiger battalions? I thought this was suppose to be a complete order of battle? ;)

The game was announced and launched in a modest fashion but is slowly rising. I am convinced this game has has the potential to become a classic like Paths of Glory.
It has all major '41-'45 campaigns, an accessible system, quick gameplay, extreme high replay value because of the chits, great components. Oh, and the price is just great too!

Overall, a fun and unique take on the War in the East from '41 to '45. The chit pull function is a clever way to handle the changing capabilities of the two sides during the course of the conflict. I find myself struggling with the same decisions that faced Stalin and Hitler during the war. Go for Moscow or South for economic conquests? Mask Leningrad or strive to take it? Defend Moscow at all costs, or withdraw to preserve forces? That said there are some things that give me pause, or leave me scratching my head. Rather than summarize here, I will list some "variants" I have, or will try to address the issues I have.

1. Stalin Mandatory Attack activation counter stays in the game through the end of 1943, except for Mud turns.

Rationale: The middle game tends towards idleness from the Soviet side with little happening on the board till they receive their stronger chits in '44, and get away from the STAVKA/ZHUKOV attack supply restraints. This allows the Soviets to build up too much. I've found the Soviets rebuilt their entire army in late 42 or early 43. This just feels wrong given the tremendous casualties they took historically in 41 and 42. This will force more action in the middle of the war, and raise the Soviet casualty rate closer to historical losses. Stalin was impatient to throw the invaders out, and took major offensive risks (and the Red Army suffered accordingly) on numerous occasions before they booted the Germans out for good starting in summer '43. The Soviets should feel (and pay for) this pressure more in the mid game imo. In addition, in the late war, this *helps* the Soviets because they get another chance each turn to move and attack. To avoid giving them too much power the max number Stalin mandated attacks ALLOWED is 12 in 1942 and 43.

2. German Panzer corps ZOC. I find it extremely frustrating that reduced Panzer divisions lose their ZOC, and that motorized divisions have none at all. If one or more *supplied* panzer divisions are stacked with a supplied motorized division, the stack has a ZOC. Note that mud/first winter snow turns still removes their ZOC, as does marsh.

Rationale: Spreading out the panzers and panzer grenadiers to form pockets is counter-intuitive. an infantry corps represents 2-3 divisions (6-9 regiments) of foot mobile units. A panzer corps of 1 Pz Div and 1 motorized division consist of 4-5 *motorized* infantry regiments. I submit this force is just as (if not more) capable of forming a cordon then 6-9 regiments of leg infantry.

3. Soviet 1-4 infantry divisions cannot be replaced until ALL other unit types that can be refit/rebuilt have been first. 

Rationale: As others have stated, with no overrun rules, the Soviet player can "clog up" the board with 1-4's thereby stonewalling the Germans to a greater degree than feels historical, especially in the latter months of 1941. 

4. Soviets can fortify 2 VP Major Cities: At the cost of 10 RP each, the Soviets can build a weak fortress in up to 2 major cities during the game. This allows the Soviets to prevent retreats ala Leningrad and Sevastopol, which have built in fortresses. 

Rationale: I am bothered that replication of the defense of Stalingrad (and Moscow if the Germans had gotten into the city proper) cannot be easily recreated because cities do not have a "no retreat" option without them. Especially considering the Kursk salient fortifications have been accounted for in the game. And finally, I'm puzzled that the fortified zones are on the map in front of Moscow, but there is no man-made defenses in the city proper. This doesn't feel right to me.

5. Make Bryansk a VP city.

Rationale: Many have said the '41 Victory Conditions are very hard on the Germans. This helps alleviate this, and makes the Moscow are more attractive in '41. Since there are so few objectives on the north half of the map, it almost pulls the German away from Moscow to grab the Southern VP cities in their abundance to avoid losing the game in '41 due to Sudden Death Victory Conditions.

6. Supply concentration.

In 1941, the Germans can "concentrate supply" by forgoing the advance of up to two of their supply depots. This allows them to make an extra roll for other depots on a one for one basis. Note that a single depot is limited to two rolls maximum. You cannot give two extra rolls to one depot.

Rationale: The Moscow option fully visited. OKH convinces Hitler to not try and "boil the ocean" in 1941. They convince Hitler that in order to have a realistic chance to take Moscow, Leningrad and the Don Basin will have to wait till '42, and adjust logistics appropriately to focus on Army Group Center. This has risks because if the Germans fail to take Moscow, odds are they won't get to the southern VP hexes in enough quantity to avoid a Sudden Death defeat.

Mix and match as you see fit. :-)

Another Ted Racier's design on the Eastern Front!  I am always interested in the German invasion of Russia.  Keep'em coming and double the size! 

There here have been many praises that many things people want about WWII eastern front have been infused into this 30 pages something rulebook. It is true. It integrates command problem, operational doctrine, supply, i.e. the big picture issues, I would say, closely, while "de-emphasizing" the "intricacies" of final engagement outcome with a comparatively straightforward "CRTs". Right, there are two CRTs for both sides, depending on the time in which the engagements are conducted. And yes, there are many time-specific rules in here. Better to get download of some DIY reference sheet online to smooth the game progress. Plus, the unpredictability of chit-pull activation system is designed to foil your best laid plan.  

Overall, my impression of the game is positive having read the rulebook. I will soon know how does it fare against the more classic I-go-U-go Russian Campaign or the designer's own Stalin's War.

------------------
The gameplay is not bad, but not perfect either after one game.  There are some rules that stop me cold (check out my question in Rules forum on fortifications, OOS effect on ZOC, the use of Panzer Command chit and Panzer HQ Command Range).  The USSR can sift through like water among the German units in retreat and in a direction towards German border....)  The map is great and looks like a cool operational map for the commanders.  German airpower is treated right with airbase rules and works like within Luftwaffe group operational boundary.  There seems to be a lot of DR or DR* (with a step loss if the defender has more than 1 step in the hex) results on the CRTs.  The pace of German attack doesn't look like a lot blitz tactics.  I will have to think about more on how to make best use of the rules instead of the rules growing on me as to how to play good German strategy.  Maybe things will change into a different picture if I play the USSR side later.  I feel they have the same faceless units with same combat strength and movement allowance.

A good Russian front game in the same style as the Russian Campaign -> Russian Besieged series, but with two maps and divisions as well as corps/armies so the scale is a bit more detailed.  I've tried the Barbarossa scenario and found the Russian's tough to break through, a chronic failing of mine it seems.  I don't think a good combined armor/air strategy matters nearly as much as in War Without Mercy.  On the other hand, the second activation for some panzer armies on some turns rewards paying careful attention to cohesion of your armored forces.  The varied pool of activation chits is an elegant way of capturing the ebb and flow of logistics, expertise and doctrine for the two sides.

Materials are first rate and rules clear.

Played the Fall Blau scenario in 2018, same result of slow German breakthrough and resulting defeat.

RATING: N/A
The usual pros and cons with Ted's designs.  Pros:  it appears well researched, it's not that complex, and the decisions a player makes within a single chit pull can be interesting, and sometimes challenging.  Cons:  it takes too long to set up, it takes too long to play, there are too many units, and the chit-pull mechanism produces too much chaos on the one hand (am I playing the game, or the chits playing me) and not enough historical outcome on the other.  There are bits of fiddly rules that would have best been dropped in development and playtesting, and oddities like the invincible Odessa.  So based on that I would rate this a "not so good" depiction of the Eastern Front of WW2 - neither outstanding nor terrible - but one I could be willing to play if asked, i.e. a "4".

For a "mini-monster" it is surprisingly easy to get into the game as the basic rules are well done, plus not as long as you would think for a game this size.  The chit activation system is good and bad-good because you can actually simulate the large pockets at the start of Barbarossa or the Russian momentum in '44-45.  Bad in that it seems to make the turns longer and if the chits are pulled in the wrong order it can heavily skew the shorter scenarios.  Overall, a good game.

This game has so many problems that it is hard to know where to begin.  It is full of fiddly little special rules and exceptions, many of which seem to be inconsequential, which is perhaps as well as they are bound to be overlooked.  Set aside at least a couple of hours to sort out the counters and set up a scenario.  Then look forward to massive downtime between moves, especially for the Soviets in Barbarossa, who will be able to finish reading War and Peace while the Germans are moving. Small hexes and big stacks of little counters are an unwelcome return to the "good old days" of 1970's wargaming.  The weird CRT allows any Russian city to be captured easily because all you need is a DR result and - Hey Presto! - Stalingrad is yours.  Stukas roam rear areas targeting powerful units 100 miles behind the front.  The amazing teleporting assault gun unit pops up anywhere, Leningrad one day, Rostov the next.  In the 1942 scenario you are at the mercy of dice rolls to get Sevastopol and if somewhat unlucky you have lost regardless of your brilliant strategy elsewhere.  Combat is remarkably bloodless, so it feels more like 18th century pirouettes than a meat grinder.

All in all this game is a lot of hard work, requires a huge time effort, is certainly not my idea of fun, and is of very questionable realism.  With the nerfed Russian CRT and no fog of war it is very hard to see how a Stalingrad encirclement can be pulled off.  The inclusion of division-sized units in huge numbers adds little, nor does the removal and replacement of units.

This is probably okay for a solo player with a huge amount of spare time, but to my mind it is hopeless compared to East Front or The Russian Campaign.

Brilliant semi-monster east front game, takes a lot of time but I'm enjoying the ride. Chit pull system works wonders with the mechanics and simulates chaos and unpredictability, but still tugs you gently along the historical rails.

I'd disregard the comments about the game being broken or impossible for Germans, there are several proofs to counter both accusations.

The rules manual could do with some fine-tuning and clarifications still, but they're not as complicated or fiddly as some people here seem to suggest (note my bias, I love thick manuals, but this one isn't thick by any measure).

Be prepared to download or make player aids to ease the flow of the game (there are plenty of good ones to download out there), also Vassal play makes tracking things really smooth and easy.

I don't have a lot of experience on games with this scale, but I'm enjoying this one immensely, it's not too time-consuming but still gets you involved deeply. 

I've read words of high praise on TDV made by people who have had east front boardgaming as a hobby for 40-50 years, I think those gentlemen really know what they're talking about!

Second copy pre-ordered. 
This game rocks ! The chit-pull system is brilliant, keeps both players active and interested. Good map, great counters. Great development. Rule book a little odd in how it's layed out: you have some critical rules in the playbook - I would expect them to be in the rule book.

A great game with pretty simple mechanics and a clean system which hums along really nicely. Not fussy but it all works so well…the design doesn't need chrome bolted on as it just all works so well to bring about results which feel like they should. You get a real flavour of the Blitzkreig and slugfest in turns…For me too long to play the whole war using this game (for that I'd turn to No Retreat). But for the scenarios, or for using the scenarios and jumping of and on points for extended campaigns it is excellent - and I suspect how it will be most used and respected. If your at all interested in the Eastern Front of world war 2 this and No Retreat in your collection are the way to go...

I give this game a 5 because it was not play-tested sufficiently to reveal issues. There are way too many 1-4 Russian divisions. The first two turns of Barbarossa play well, but after that the 1-4s come onto the scene and clog up the board. Reminds me of AH's 1914. There is no AV so the German player can do nothing to move ahead. Encirclement is no longer possible with so many Russians in depth. Cities, which were often turned into fortresses (Stalingrad), are easy to capture because the Russian can't ignore retreat results. It's difficult to kill units using their CRT. On and on... However, beautiful map and bits so you could fix the game with some minor rule changes.

Ich kenne kein besseres "Barbarossa"-Game, zumindest keines, das einer historischen Simulation näher käme. "EastFront" ist leichter handhabbar, spielt gegenüber DV jedoch eher in der Landesliga.

My favourite East Front game. Right up there with Across The Pacific as my favourite wargames. Playable, gives you a great feel for the East Front Campaign. Chit pull mechanic works a treat. Love the fact it's at a Divisional level for the Panzers units.

Barbarossa is a good scenario, interesting and funny but bagration scenario is totaly unbalanced and not very well playtested (imho). Chit picks can change too much the outcome of the game.
Campaign game except the start and nearly the end is also boring.

The best Eastern Front wargame I have ever played. Absolutely superb. 
Chit pull system makes play exciting and unpredictable - a great boon for solitaire gamers.
Map is excellent even though some hard peering is required to pick out some set-up regions.
Counters are fine, although I would have preferred NATO symbols for armour.
The rules are a pleasure to read and are easy to follow.
The most pain-free monster game ever!

I'm starting to think that this will become THE heavy East Front game . . . maybe.

Update: Well, it's just a bit too fiddly for me, and too many special rules, and it's just not the one.  I'll stick with Eastfront.

In the middle of my first game. Rulebook could be more helpful and better organized. I think more notes could have been added to the player aid cards as well. Ted is giving excellent support for the game here and on CSW.

Excellent feel for the eastern front so far. The Germans have to work to make Barbarossa successful, its not an 'auto' like it is in some games.

For only two maps, Ted has aligned the campaign area at an angle, thus allowing more of Russia to be shown than in most EF games. You can truly see the distance that AGS travelled as compared to AGN. In most other EF games, this is not readily apparent.

Pre-ordered from Hobbycraft in Anchorage to pick up in March.

At Consim Expo 2014 the designer was my roommate and didn't realize it.

I asked him what he was playing....

"Gonna play some Dark Valley".

Me, "Oh really I just picked that up!  What do you think of the game?  Is it good or crap?"

Ted chuckles, "Oh I think I like it, after all I designed it."

Not exact quote but it was along those lines.  Felt like crawling into a hole. :O)

The chit pulls give the enormous front a manageable handle, but it is the inclusion of the logistics check as a random chit pull that makes the game kick you. The stunning Mahaffey map is a field for what is a formidable German challenge to sustain Barbarossa's shock & progress.

The way the ruleset creates encirclements & huge consequential losses is lovely to see at this scale.

The Dark Valley falls between a number of other east front games. It is a relatively easy game to understand and play. I rarely felt that I have played it wrong. It does require some puzzling in terms of finding out how to achieve that encirclement, paving the way for supply and generally moving forward. The chit draw system, which essentially is what makes it different than many other traditional east front games, does not feel as wild as in A Victory Lost. Due to the fact that there are so many units it is hard to see that an individual chit draw will decide the game.

The game has a lot of counters and therefore takes quite some time to set up. On the other hand there is really no need to keep tab on every individual Russian infantry division. You might as well have a generic set up (instead of the specific division starting in Krasnodar you could have five 1-4 inf div and 1 3-8 mech or whatever). 

I would actually compare this with Fire in the East, Ty Bombas east front division game, Proud Monster, and actually Gary Grigsby´s computer game (one of a very few instances where you could actually compare a boardgame with a computer game). Fire in the East is a little bit grander, much better looking and with a fun airgame subsystem. Fire in the East is too old in mechanics though and is a substantially greater investment of time and space. It was a while since I played Proud Monster and I do prefer TDV. Gary Grigsby´s War in the East has the same type of encirclements as this one and is a really good choice as well. 

So how does it rate? So far as a very good effort. I would like to play the mid-term scenarios to get a better overview, but the chit draw system is good and the fact that the number of chits, and the type of chits each players receive is excellent. The rest of the game is pretty straightforward, which is good because it takes some getting used to the chit draw system and the strategies that goes along with it.

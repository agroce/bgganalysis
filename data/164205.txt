Quite a lot of variability here.  I had an uneasy balance between tactics and strategy: planning was quite difficult, but necessary.  Gave me a lot of AP.  A pretty darned long game with 4 players.  It didn't feel that much different than other cube-engine games, but the design was solid.

Neat bag builder, with some crunchy decisions.  There seems to be a good amount of ways to win, with many of the building abilities seeming overpowered or broken, however in our first game of this, the scores were pretty close.  The game is longer than 60min, and there is a good amount of downtime per tern, however this is one of the better bag builders out there for sure.

This is a elegant,  well built game. First game was exciting and interesting. I have a doubt on a couple of buildings that seems a bit overpowered, but in all I want to replay this gladly. Impressive!

Like the idea of having corrupt pawns in the bag. Other wise deckbuilder but with a bag.

RATING: 6
Fun idea, not-great execution. While generally a pretty elegant game, the two side elements (investing in personalities and fighting on the game board) are underdeveloped and lack nuance or interest. There isn't a lot of tension in most of the choices. Also, there are downtime problems as each player turn can involve a number of persnickety management decisions which can bog the game down. If King's Pouch actually played in the advertised one hour, I think it would be fine, but I can't imagine many players will be able to do that. It's not terrible, but for 2014, games need to do a bit better than this.

All the ingredients of a good euro are here with some very clever and fresh ideas : the bag building with 2 forms  of workers, the corrupt citizens..
But KP is also fiddly and long for what it is Some effects feel unbalanced. I will definitely play again.

Fun bag building game, where your workers have different shapes, depending on their color, so you can recognize them by your fingertips without peaking inside your bag.

Plus this game can be played on an hour, much quicker than other bag-builders (like Orleans or Hyperborea).

Multi-language rulebook (corean, german and english).

Average edition (thin cards with unusual dimensions and shiny boards).

  We played a third of a game of the Korean King's Pouch before we realised we had a fundamental rule wrong.  At that point we gave up.  It is a WP game on personal player boards with a combined conflict area on the main board.  The interesting mechanic is that you draw five workers from your personal bag each round.  Workers come in five colours but also in two shapes.  So you never know quite what you will have to play with each round but you can ensure you minimise the risk of drawing one particular useless colour (these are the 'corrupt officials' who of course can only be put to good use in the 'city hall' building). 

The negative of the game is that you do all your round activity in one long slog, so downtime for the other three around the table is long.  And it can only get longer during the game as more buildings become available to place your workers in.

At first it looks like just a very simple bag-builder, but once you hit the second phase the interesting buildings start coming out. It feels like almost every building is overpowered and breaks the game. But this actually makes the game interesting.

The different sized cubes are an interesting element, as are the corrupt officials and the manipulation of the refresh action. It certainly has a lot more depth to it than I thought at first glance. I like it.

It all works, other than turn order. Try reversing turn order so player in last place goes first. Feeling in the bag works fine. As there are more options and chains, downtime increases. Some AP potential. Ran a bit long. Maybe two rounds per age with scoring at the end of 2, 4, and 6

First play through was good. So much to think about and chaining building together is a brain buster. But wouldn't want it any other way.

Decent game.  A mechanism including - most notably - bag building and development paths (implemented as buildings to construct).

I'm certainly not the fan of the latter, but there are different reasons why the game won't get a '6' from me: it's just too long for what it is and it's way too solitaire.  
In theory it matters what others do - they can take buildings you want or conquer a region before/after you etc.  But in reality you don't manipulate the turn order (dependent on players' positions on VP track and you want to to maximize VPs each turn).  And what's the most discouraging you don't care what others do on their boards during their turns (and they can shuffle the bits there for quite a while).

The balance of buildings is questionable - some seem (much) stronger than others.  I played only once so I might be wrong, but others - with greater experience - share this doubt too.

A mechanically compact bag building game that isn't unfortunately able to use its core mechanism to its full advantage. It also falls a bit into the multiplayer solitaire category. The main route for interaction is the map with light warring where attacker always wins. It's just constant point trading and gaining ground on your turn and then you'll again lose ground before your next turn. Still, it's somewhat nice to play because of its sound mechanical structure.

A would-be interesting city  buidling all smashed up by unnessecary negative interaction that simply spoils all the fun. Shame.

A nice little game with several paths to victory. I have only played it 2 player so far but it works very nicely and although you complete the whole of your turn before the next player has theirs, there is not too much downtime at all. On your turn you place cubes on occupations/buildings on your board, you then actuate those occupations in any order you wish (even to provide extra workers for the current round). This gives money to buy another occupation/building (1/turn so choose wisely) and to purchase favours (victory points), it also provides battle points to conquer territory thus gaining extra victory points. Recommended as an interesting alternative to the usual worker placement/area control game. 
There has been comment on player order; yes the first player gets first choice of occupation/building but we have not experienced this as game breaking and in fact there is some incentive to be last to play to get the last action militarily and thereby get the better scoring for conquered territory. We have not had a problem in 2 player games at all but I do not think it would break the game if you alternated (went round the table) with a start player marker if you are worried about it.

The game is not very pretty, but you can feel how much thought went into the design. The bag builder with different shapes and colours of tokens in the bag makes for a really neat mechanism. The rest of the game is solid, with an ok dose of theme, good interaction and direct confrontation.

We had some doubts how strong the player order is, and whether it makes the game too much win-to-win. Might have to houserule this if it turns out to be a problem.

RATING: 5
A nicely done bag building engine with an interesting twist that you can deliberately fish for specialist cubes or generic hexagones when drawing workers from the bag. The dish is only half-cooked, however: the balance of buildings seems to be off in some cases, and, a lot worse, the engine is bundled with a small wargame component that manages to be bland, shallow and arbitrary all at once. It’s amazing how many designers nowadays insist on repeating the worst errors that were perpetrated in the early days of our hobby, and how few developers seem to be willing or able to help them out.
This relegates King’s Pouch to a a promising prototype, and thus, in this oversaturated market, straight to the bin.

A solid bag building Euro with a few flaws, particularly no variability in the buildings which come out every round. While this will limit the game's replay value, I look forward to playing the game intermittently.

Interesting game from Korea, I prefer this much more than Orleans. The rules are written very well, the graphics are ok (I think they should left the one cube cards with symbol in the upper area of the card). Surprise Hit so far. 
I can see the discussion about the starting player issue.

Straight forward bag-building and Worker-Placement game that plays also really good with two. The bag building with two different shapes and different colours of workers for different tasks is neat! Very underrated game in our opinion.

King's Pouch is a pouch-building game--each turn you draw a number of tokens from your pouch which determine what kind of actions you can take, and as the game progresses, you can add new tokens or remove old tokens from the bag.  Having differently-shaped pieces in the bag doesn't work as well as it might seem, as it was hard to distinguish between cubes and hexagonal prisms with your fingers.  There was a ton of downtime in this game, as each player had to puzzle out the entirety of his turn at once.  Board play wasn't that interesting.  It was also a little too easy to streamline your bag, eliminating all of the bad pieces, or even working yourself into a steady state where you know exactly what you're going to draw each turn.

Well, there seems to be something very wrong with this game, at least with 2 (my only playing experience). The player with the most points becomes starting player, which makes that he can pick as first the best building there is. And so he will score more points and stay first player and will always have first pick. And some buildings are clearly stronger then others, so this makes a huge difference!

Interesting design with a new mechanic which seems to become popular this year - bag drafting. Plays well with 3 ( my first game). Interessting from the beginning, good amount of planning ahead is needed to pull some interesting combos in the next turn. Could be AP prone. I was Playing military - point collection engine. Had some problems with money, but still managed to tie with the winner. I want to play more to explore the game.

Quite a novel game with an interesting mechanic of pulling one of two shapes out of bag which slowly builds up, with an interesting penalty type of citizen appearing as you refill. Players are also doing minor map movements and building buildings which slowly increase powers while also typically requiring particular-coloured specific cubes available to activate them.

After the first few comments here on BGG, I wasn't expecting a lot from this indy title that was only available as a pre-order at Essen 2014. My first three player game, however, was very interesting and one of the other players liked it so much that she asked me if it could still be purchased. Because of the discussions regarding the importance of playing order in this game, we were warned not to neglect the military powers when trailing behind. We didn't, and the last player was able to score a lot of points in the last round because of it, making him second. After playing a (very enjoyable) two player game, I suspect that the game works best with three players, as there are more buildings to choose from each round than in a two or four player game, making a lead score less significant.

Medieval euro bag builder. Place workers and spend gold to develop your engine with buildings on your personal board. Influence the Royal family for points or to gain advantage,  The twists for me is the sub area control map with military, the temptation of taxation for extra gold, and the addition of corrupt workers as your labor pool expands. I like how military area dominance is neutralized with lower cost to defend near home. I also like how the building cards are thoughtful in their function/rule breaking and how they require specific dudes to trigger the primary or secondary effect. I like how the game gives distinct advantages for first and last in turn order. The different shapes in the bag allowing for educated guess worker pulling is unique but this seems like it could lead to AP from excessive fondling--Pull your dudes already!

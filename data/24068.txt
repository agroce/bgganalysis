RATING: 3
Poorly balanced. Taking weapons is strictly better than going for information cards or the luck-ridden healing cards which do nothing for your character half of the time. Just let others waste time on information cards -- if they start attacking you, you obviously know to attack them back.
Wounded players are forced to spend turns on one-shot healing effects.

And player elimination? Yuck.

Have had a few plays with a group of friends. Definitely a lot of fun with the right people! You never know who is on your team or what peoples objectives may be! Always a fun and different game each time. 

One thing I should note though Is I do not own this game, nor do I want too. Its fun and all - and if a friend has it on the table i'll play it. But other than that I don't need this game on my shelf.

Shadow Hunters is middle-ground between hidden identity games like The Resistance:Avalon and dice-driven games like King of Tokyo. If you can stand losing and love trying to play around dice rolls, then try it. If you get tantrums when the dice do not go the way you preferred, then skip it.

130929 Its fun and silly enough I will try it again.  However, its only because its not too long.  I swear that I never know what to do while playing this game.  Its a game on autopilot in a bad way for me.  I feel like I have no control.

RATING: 7
Frequently played in my playgroup. The positives: it doesn't take very long, and can be a good end-of-night game as it doesn't require too much thinking. 

That's also it's negatives, for me: I really don't see much strategy to it, and I wouldn't really classify it as a hidden role game since there isn't much incentive to bluff from a strategy POV. But some in my playgroup have fun doing it anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun deduction game, to play once in a while, as a filler. Plays better with a larger group. The artwork on the cards is very good, but the text on the cards is near illegible. Luck also plays heavily in this game, which is a downside in my opinion.

This is a decent thematic hidden-role game. More interesting than The Resistance, more accessible than Battlestar, quick to explain and play. It isn't as fun as Saboteur 2 because, as with the previously mentioned games, it takes itself too seriously. In this genre, I want something light and funny with plenty of banter between players. The fantasy theme is just a little too earnest for me.

Only marginally better than any roll and move game. You roll the dice and perform the action denominated by the result. The players are given the choice of who to hit only, and that involves yet another die roll. I don't mind using dice to decide things but I'd really would like to make some decisions myself. 

2016-12-15
Maybe it is fair to elaborate what makes Shadow Hunters better than a regular roll and move. It is the second guessing and deduction elements the game has. You do not know the identities of each other and you have to try to somehow work it out who is on your side. Moreover, sometimes you have to choose between taking a bad action or pretty much revealing your identity. But other than that, you are not given much choice. 

The ultimate reason for rating this a four is the lack of meaningful decision making.

Kind of like Bang, but without the annoyance of distance and crazy defense. It's a lot more open and anyone can win with the different goals. It could be considered a bit more random than Bang though. Still, the plus over Bang is that everyone has about the same chance of winning, unlike the Renegade. A little too much text though.

Too word-y, too card-y.  It doesn't deliver the uber-Bang! bang it promised.  The cards are just too volatile.  Other than that, a fine effort of a game.  Unfortunately the complexity of the cards is the heart of the game.

RATING: 8
+ Chaotic, especially with hidden roles, but within a structure that keeps the game moving along nicely; Lots of cajoling around the table makes for good stories.
- Can be difficult to deduce others' roles within the structure of the game (with green cards).

RATING: 8
This was a blast, no one had any idea who was on what team until there were 2 people left (in a 5 player game), due to lying.  Glorious!

A slightly heavier hidden role/team game that has gone over well each time it hit the table, played with three different game groups.  A great step up from Resistance, where the game gives you more things to talk about and do, rather than being a pure social deduction/bluffing game.

Werewolf done right!  (Not that Werewolf was done wrong to begin with...)  Plays fast and is tons of fun!  While the game is very random, this simply places more emphasis on the initial deduction phase, which works out pretty well.  The random elements mean that the early game is very chaotic while everyone pokes other people and tries to learn things, or provoke them into revealing.  In the mid-game, sides are drawn and alliances/enemies become more apparent.  The end is really just cleanup and dice rolling.

I would love to play this one again and I will probably pick up a copy at some point.

RATING: 6
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Shadow Hunters is basically Werewolf with a board. The game-play is very different but it also gives a lot of the same vibes. It's a decent bluffing game. The special powers and the structure of team vs team may not make this game innovative but for sure make it enjoyable. There's a lot of randomness, but in a filler like this that doesn't bother me so much. The whole management of the cards instead feels kinda jumbled and too random for my taste... making it for sure the element that I disliked the most. It may seem strange, but I find more annoying to be screwed up by the drawing of a card than to be screwed up by a dice roll.

As a whole Shadow Hunters is an entertaining game. It creates some nice social dynamics and some silly fun, but at the same time it's not a game I wouldn't go out of my way to play. I think there's much better similar games on the market at this point.

I've technically played this once before, but it was long ago and without expansion rules. I enjoyed the 2 games we played of this, and it was a light resistance style game. I think it would stand up to repeat plays, and the theme is fitting.

Hard for me to get to the table though, with 7-8 being optimal player counts.

Imagine you have to protect your team and kill the other team. Sounds pretty simple, right? Not when you don't know who anyone really is! Throw some neutrals into the mix with weird win conditions and we have a fun little game. It's pretty random, and there are some odd colour decisions with the pieces, but it's fun nonetheless.

A great deduction game similar to Bang!  In this game, you are one of three types (Shadow, Hunter, or Neutral).  The Shadows want to kill the Hunters, and vice-verse, but the civilians have their own winning objectives.  The dilemma is that once you find out if you are a shadow, hunter, or neutral, you do not know who your teammate(s) are, and who your enemies are!  You have to deduce this throughout the game by passing cards to other players which give you a little information about them, finally deducing who they are.  Each player also has a special ability they can use if they reveal themselves.

The game generally starts slowly with everyone afraid to make an attack as they try to deduce other players' roles.  After much deduction, the action starts as players throw dice attacks at each other and try to call in the help of (possible) allies.

I'm not fully sure what I think of Shadow Hunters at this point. I'm calling it decent. I want to play it some more because I thought it was interesting. But it's so luck heavy--I'm trying to figure out if it's interesting because the gameplay offers me good choices or if the design is simply offering the appearance of choices that are more or less railroaded by the luck of the game.

Pros
- Attacking others is fun
- Supports up to 8
- Trying to figure out who is what through deduction

Cons
- Player elimination and waiting can be a problem
- Other games does what it does better and less text (The Resistance)
- Once all the roles are revealed, the game might end up still going and it's less interesting
- The theme is not really there
- The weapons and items can get fiddly for a hidden role game

A nice and easy party/deduction game with a vampire/werewolf theme. It sure gives a lot of fun for the price you pay! The artwork could have been a lot better though...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
At smaller numbers, it's not a particularly good game. At 7 and 8, it suddenly becomes good - though you have to accept that it's all just meaningless and random. It works at a high play count mostly because it's light enough that you can chat while waiting for your turn coming around. With too few people, your turn comes around too fast - making you pay attention when the game isn't worth paying that much attention to - and the deduction becomes pretty dull.

But once you have 7 or 8 players, it's a decent game and you're liable to play many rounds. But, expect it to be more of something to do with your hands on the side, while socializing, than anything else.

Semi-cooperative party game. Players have secret roles with unique abilities and are divided into 2 groups (werewolves and vampires). The are also some human roles that have their own unique victory conditions. The game is easy to teach and play. Supports up to 8 players. Reminds me a bit of Bang! with dice roll during combat. They both have player elimination but they can be very fun to play with the right group of people.

I have owned this for a while but never got it to the table. Gave it a run at Kingdom Con this year and really enjoyed it. The game is quick, and it definitely doesn't take itself too seriously. Since then, I have brought it to a party game day and a worknight game thing and both times it was popular, with us getting several plays in each day. I do think the Neutral characters get boned though, and that their win conditions are usually the worst.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An incomplete-information game like werewolves, resistance, etc., but this game still stays on a fun board-game, since it not a game of doubting/deceiving but of guessing. 

Each player in this game acts as a character belonging to one of the following factions: Shadow, Hunter and Neutral.

Shadow's objective is to defeat all Hunters, and Hunter's objective is to defeat all Shadows. The game is almost a game of Shadows vs Hunters, as the name shows, but there is a 3rd faction named Neutral. Each Neutral player has his/her own objective: survive until the game ends, help specified player to win, collect specified items, etc.

The most important concept is that, when the game starts, each player doesn't know who the other players are.
Each player must try to find out other player's identity during the game and consider how to help or interrupt his/her play. There are cards/events which help player to know other's identity, but players can also guess others' identities by observing their actions. There are situations during the game such as: "The two players are fighting against each other, but which is our side...?"

This game is designed by Japanese, but all the texts and materials are written in English. Yes, this game is more friendly to English-speakers than Japanese-speakers:)

Wayyyy to random, slow, and not enough to do. Chuck dice blindly, draw card and do what it says. First half of game can just be chopped off.. Role deduction picks up once people start nearing death. So before that, you attack random people to get data. It's Mostly near-blind/random decisions of which player to target. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
In the first third of the game, you roll dice and damage random players because you don't know who is on your team.

In the middle third of the game, some players will finally draw the right green cards to find an ally/enemy of theirs, which other players can infer from their attack patterns. The level of social deduction is shallow.

In the final third of the game, enough information is known that the correct actions to take are obvious and the game becomes a decision-free roll-'n-go game.

I tried this game three times, and each time was aggressively un-fun. For the record, I played this in a group that loves Resistance/Coup/Secret Hitler. I also like many social deduction games. This one is just awful.

la maldición de este juego es que ha pasado desapercibido para el gran público, pero con la debida publicidad... de esto ya me encargaré yo. Muy recomendable. De este tipo de juegos para mí el mejor.

After initial outing: A fun 20 minute game of bluff and murder.  The game system neatly limits your attacking options and it is fun to try and work out who is for and against you.  Recommended light game for 6 or more.

Essen '08 purchase.  Bought on the back of earlier plays, which were great fun.  Sadly, different group, flat experience, has taught me this won't work every time, especially with some early player elimination.

The pendulum swings.  Fourth outing and much fun, hilarity and table talk around.  This really is a hit or miss game depending much upon the group you are playing with.  I use/recommend a house rule that when you attack players on the same or adjacent space you attack all of the players on that space, not just one.  This shortens the game which I prefer as it is a an elimination game.

RATING: 5
I'm not quite sure about this one still.  Feels like something is missing.  

**update**
I've decided this game isn't for me.  I don't particularly like the way the roles are balanced.  I find that one interesting part of the game (the hidden roles), conflicts with another interesting part (the special powers) since you can't be hidden and use your power.

Once the players are revealed the game boils down to a less-than-thrilling dice fest.

I'd much rather play Saboteur or straight up Werewolf.

RATING: 7.3
A deduction game. You can be part of the hunters team or the shadows team or you can be neither (neutral). Each player/character has unique set of stats and winning conditions.
At first no one knows who is one their team, so that's the first thing to do - knowing who is on your team, then you can start attacking and doing all sorts of things to your opponents.
At least 4 players are needed to play this.

If you go into this game thinking it's supposed to utilize brilliant deductive thinking than don't play.  It's just a fun, simple game with flavorful roles that creates a good atmosphere.  

My only complaint is that some of the neutral characters are lacking.  They are the least fun to play unless you're Daniel and some of them just flat out suck.  

I love Mafia and this game is similar.  Bang! is fun too, but I enjoy this more if I'm going to play that type of game. For it's price, Shadow Hunters is a great game.

This has been my favorite game for the past 2 years and I can play it any time, even when I'm not in the mood to play games. My non-gaming friends request it often and I always end up enjoying it. I almost never record plays but I have played this over 100 times. We have also played with up to 11 people even though it says up to 8. Just find 2 matching chits to use for health and location and you are good to go. It takes a bit longer but not too much when everyone knows what they are doing.

The premise is good; werewolf with some more rules.  In the end, the randomness is just too much.  Did I randomly get enough Hermit cards to figure out my team/opponents?  Were those Hermit cards useful? Did I get a good item?  Did I dynamite myself?  Did I get dealt 5 damage on a normal attack?  I tend to lose this one because I have a hard time paying attention.  If it had less downtime (could you play simultaneously?) then it would be great.

Good game, sort of like Werewolf but can play with less (although I would imagine you need at least 5, despite the option to play with 4).  My only complaint is that it seems the hermit cards are of little use in the long run.  In the 3 games I've played, it seems that one person will usually reveal themselves for some reason (to use a card or their special ability), and then it is easy to figure out who is who depending on whether they attack that person.  Still an enjoyable deduction sort of game.

RATING: 9
If you say "hidden roles" or "hidden goals" I will generally say "let's play!"  I'm a sucker for these style of games, especially when some of the hidden roles are intended to work as a team.  There's just so much intrigue in sniffing out your friends and enemies and then trying to trust your allies once you think you have them pegged.  The interaction of the roles in this game are great, and that just adds to my enjoyment.  I especially love how the Neutral characters add exciting twists, like someone who wants to die first and someone who just wants to steal a bunch of stuff.

If I were to make a complaint about the game it would simply be that an experienced player has a massive leg up on a rookie.  Knowing the roles and how they work is vital to deducing who is who.  And, although you can attempt to get new players up to speed, it often takes one full game before they completely understand what they should do.  The nice thing is the game is relatively short, so playing a couple times in a row isn't that difficult.

Excellent - has been described as "like Bang!" I would say it is everything Bang! should be. Half an hour long, with lots more subtlety, much less equipment and much more in the way of opportunities to determine friend from foe.

Now, after 4 plays, this one is still growing on me. Sure the opening round or two is fairly random (rather like the opening rounds of Werewolf), but you can learn an awful lot in those first couple of rounds and you soon home in on your enemies.

*Update* A dozen plays and still great.

*Update* 134 plays and still going strong.

RATING: 8
Made curious by the statement that «it is kinda Bang», I managed to try and play Shadow Hunters and immediately enjoyed it: in the end it is much better than its Western counterpart for its wider range of rivalries, hidden abilities and personal goals.

It surely isn’t and won’t be the ultimate game but succeeds in what many other renowned games fail: attracting, entertaining and thrilling even the most inattentive or casual gamers. (October 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - After playing the English edition as well (for the last two years I’ve been stuck with the German one, Jäger der Nacht) I’ve noticed that not only are the differences between both versions minimal but the former is also slightly better than the latter: for example, theme and most of the illustrations are more inspiring in Shadow Hunters than in its German counterpart but Jäger der Nacht’s board is way better (read: bigger, more practical and less crowded) than Shadow Hunters’.

Anyhow, since basic gameplay doesn’t change between both editions, my rating keeps unchanged too.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite deduction games.  The only downside is the player elimination that exists in the game, but the game usually does not last very long, so this is not a deal breaker for me.  

Some people find the sides not all that even, with the shadows being more powerful, but the wins have seemed pretty even to me.

A great deduction game that everyone should own.

This was a pretty decent game.  Werewolf like, but you have cards to help you figure out who is who.  More deduction in this.  ie, more game.  We played with eight and played four times in a row, having as much fun in the subsequent games.  Again, like other games of this ilk, it would be group dependent.

Over the past year, we’ve had a number of times where we’ve had 6-8 people show up for a board game night and the majority don’t want to split up to play two different games. I’ve been trying to get some games that play well for this number (Fearsome Floors, 7 Wonders) and Shadow Hunters was the newest one to try. The one night we played it, we ended up playing two games and it went over really well with the group. I’d also been looking at the Resistance and Werewolf and chose this because it seemed to have more of a game to it. It was good, not exceptional game but met the larger group requirement perfectly.

A semi-cooperative deduction game that can hold up to 8 players.  This game reminds me of Bang!, but it has better deduction elements.  Unfortunately, it is too random (just like Bang!)... specifically, the cards are not well-balanced.  Some cards are clearly too powerful, like the chocolate bar card that fully heals the lucky player that drew it.  Also, some of the characters and special powers are pretty lame.

For these reasons and the fact that players get eliminated, I will only play periodically.

My rating for this game keeps climbing after many successful games.  It's fun and works for both experienced and non-experienced gamers alike.  This fills the niche for when a large group is massed and a short to medium length game is needed.  The game does require a group with at least six playing to make it work well.  It also requires people to not take it too seriously, it should be more a social experience.  However, I have also had individuals ruin the game by making it a pure social experience and talking out of context of the game.

Biggest downfall is when someone is knocked out early and has to wait around for the game to finish.

I have played this now with 5, 7, 8, and 9, with mixed results.  With 5, I didn't think there was much tension - teams become obvious pretty quickly, and it's a race to do damage.  More players elongated the first phase of the game where you're trying to figure out who's on your team, but didn't necessarily make it more interesting.  Overall, this is a pass for me - 5 games so far, and not one has been really interesting or fun.  Too little strategy, and not enough of anything else to make up for it.

Un filler ligerito para grupos grandes. Es un juego de puteo y deducción. Cada uno tiene un personaje secreto que puede pertenecer a una de tres categorías (shadows, hunters o neutrales).
Los shadows ganan si mueren todos los de una de las otras categorías, los hunters ganan si mueren todos los shadows y los neutrales, cada uno tiene su psropias condiciones de victoria. Hay cartas de equipamento que te pueden ayudar a hacer más daño en los ataues. Tamibén hay cartas para curar y recuperar vida y otras para obtener información de tus contrincantes.

Entretenido, sencillo y resultón. Recomendable para grupsos de más de cinco jugadores (yo de momento solo lo he probado con 7).

Several things to dislike: Player elimination; which is even worse when the roles are very unbalanced, where some characters have significantly less hit points and weaker abilities than others; the victory conditions of the human characters are often very hard to achieve and overall the humans don't seem fun to play, because they lack direction (they often don't need to find out who the other characters are and have no interest in attacking anybody, making the best tactic not to do anything that draws attention to you.)

What I like is that there are cards that give information about the role of other players, sometimes definite, sometime vague (not of this faction, first letter of the character, etc.).

Turns move quickly and the game has a nice pace to it.  Excellent - better as more players join in!

I thought this was a pretty solid game and an improvement over Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg.   

There are so few good 6 player games that it's nice to see "multi-team" games like that.  I hope more are released because the dynamics can be quite interesting.

Our group was a little trigger happy, shooting at anyone that moved without any verification of identity, so I don't think we really played very well...

Several years ago when I was first getting into the hobby, I played with a group that met every Tuesday in a FLGS now long out of business. This is one that we played fairly often and I remember really enjoying it. It was always a good time and I remember it always giving a good gaming experience.

I recently had the chance to add this to my collection and get it to the table. I'm not sure if my tastes have changed over the years or if its that I've been introduced to so many more games, but this really fell flat. Its not a game that I'd refuse to play or try to talk someone out of wanting to play it, it just didn't feel the same to me...

I will say that, at my height of enjoyment with the game, I had more fun with Bang than I have ever had with SH. But these days I would gladly play SH over Bang.

The one thing Bang has going for it is the fun roleplay aspect that comes out - not the hidden roles, or the bluffing, but just feeling like you were in a wild west showdown. SH doesn't really have the same kind of soul to it.

That said, this is mechanically a lot more sound. There's still player elimination, but it basically only comes in at the endgame (it's a lot harder to kill people) and the game is MUCH faster so it's really not an issue. 

It's also just plain simpler. I'll be happy if I never have to explain Bang to someone ever again. I would put this on par with Coach Ride to Devil's Castle.

Light-hearted secret identity game for larger groups. Similar in some respects to Bang, Werewolf and also the dreadful Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the boardgame (UK edition). The deduction element in the early part of the game is interesting but identities soon become apparent and then it's a straight-forward slugfest. "The Resistance" is the same sort of thing but maintains the mystery of who's who until the end.

Finally got an opportunity to play this and wasn't really impressed. There are some cool ideas but overall it felt random.

I would play more because it is lighter and plays in good time but it's not something I'll request. Would rather play One Night.

After owning this game for a WHILE, I finally got it to the table.  The gameplay itself is very simple.  Roll the dice, move to the designated spot, draw a card or do damage.  But once you realize how the win conditions for each player interact with others, you start to realize the strategy in the game and it becomes much more fun.  

I'd definitely recommend this game as something unique to bring to the table and I'm looking forward to my next play of it.

RATING: 7
Rated "8" after one play. It's not a flawless game... the player elimination is unusual to see after so many Euros. And, it was a bit more chaotic than I expected. But, after playing once with 8 people, everyone voiced that they enjoyed the game, and that's what counts.

Very glad to have this in my collection, because there are not many games that get better with 6+ people. And, it's enjoyable how something resembling a "plot line" emerges as players transition from not knowing anyone, to finally identifying potential team members. This game might get even better if the same group plays it multiple times.

Regarding the expansion cards, the first time we tried the new characters we mixed up the expansion and base characters. And, for future plays, I might keep the sets separate. The hack detective in me wants to deduce everyone's roles based off a known set of characters. My hunch is that all-base or all-expansion characters allows players to make more educated guesses. I think. We'll see...

If you expect to play this 10+ times, then the expansion can breathe new life and variety into the game. Otherwise, the base game is sufficient.

Update: Traded this one away for a gift certificate after not playing it for 4+ years. It's a good game, but it simply wasn't getting any table time.

12/12 update: wow, I don't know if I could like a game much less than this. In a world with so many good deduction games, why would I ever want to play this? The deduction is more just 'reduction' as you blindly flail at people until you have enough information to flail with your eyes wide open.

2/09: Used to own it. Never played it. Realized not too many people I play with would be interested and I just wasn't excited to get it to the table after reading the rules.

RATING: 5
An interesting attempt to add some mechanics to keep Werewolf interesting and give it some mechanics outside the realm of pure psychology, but the cards are kind of munchkin-esque and the die rolls can be a hassle, but at least it's harder for the group meta-game to devour the entire play session.  Also it ends in a reasonable amount of time.  I particularly like the way that you can potentially gain information about other roles as any character...   but I think I just am not a huge fan of this type of game.

Overall I hate Mafia/Werewolf, but this version is light, fun and fast. There was enough structure that I didn't feel at a loss.  The only annoying point was the character card that encourages lying. I hate lying in a game because it always causes problems. If you have to assume that anyone could be lying, what's the point of trying to gather information?

RATING: 7
The secret teams and the asymmetric powers are what make this one interesting.  There is a lot of room for deduction, but its not as big an element as one might suppose (nothing like Sleuth).

I'd like to play more, but The Resistance is preferred locally and has a lot of similar elements.

Decent game with short playtime.  Would rather play this than Werewolf (or Mafia, etc.) any day.  All right enough for a few plays in a row, but not more than that.

RATING: 3
Didn't enjoy it much. I particularly dislike the rule about single-use cards; it adds randomness to a game that could have been more strategic. The downtime is especially annoying, and, probably my biggest gripe, there is no informed minority. Maybe I'm sounding a tad too purist here, but it really did not feel like Werewolf. Then again, there is no reason why it should. But I still didn't like it. Tastes and preferences...

Probably my favorite deduction/hidden role game (on par with Battlestar and JUST behind One Night Ultimate Werewolf).

Takes the Bang! idea and kinda morphs it to be more about deduction. My favorite part of the game are the neutral parties caught in between the struggle between Shadows and Hunters. It really keeps you on your toes, especially if you're good at deducing who people are.

Only real problem is that I feel like the game works best with 6+ players which is a pretty steep number. The game is still great with less and a while lot of fun regardless. Highly recommended.

Only 1 play so far. Some young players I played with liked it. I was a bit turned off by the lame production quality (except for the box). Cards and board are lame. I heard this wasa  Bang killer. After 1 play, I'm not so sure. The one thing this does "better" is that there are things you do to attack people, like Bang, but also things you do specifically to learn others' identities. I'm not sure this is necessarily better, but is certainly different. The information gained is private, meaning that as the game goes on, each player will likely know (for sure) the identity of a few other players. If people are paying attention, players can also learn roles indirectly. Combat also adds a die, rather than being automatic. Is that better? I dunno. In the end, I don't see anything really innovative on top of Bang, but it's nice to have something similar, but different, since I don't/won't play Bang anymore. I don't expect this to have much staying power either.

A rare impulse buy, based almost exclusively on Ubarose's engaging review on Fortress: Ameritrash...

http://fortressameritrash-boardgames.com/index.php/Reviews/Shadow-Hunters

Just played 2 4-player games tonight and was very impressed. It's easy to learn and yet thoroughly entertaining. And while it's obvious that this game's sweet spot is probably 6-8, all of tonight's players were more than happy with the way it played with four, and would have gladly played several more games, had we not broken this out at the END of the evening. It's a definite winner and may well prove to be as much of a group favorite as Cash & Guns.

Update: It's great with just about any number of players. I was, however, wrong in my original prediction... this is FAR more popular than Cash & Guns in my game group. Pretty much an ideal filler or warm-up game, it's always interesting and fun! I've updated my rating from an 8 to a 9, accordingly.

Game number 200! 

I loved playing Predator's copy of this years ago, so when I saw a copy of it on sale, I grabbed it. 

My only real gripes are that some of the rules on the cards are very unclear, which leads to quite a few house rules (like can the Werewolf counterattack when he's shot by the revolver, which means he's not in the same area as his attacker), and that the base characters make it much harder for the Shadows to win - the alternative characters definitely help to level out the field though.

RATING: 7.5
This devilishly clever deduction game is like Werewolf with a vengeance.  Each team (Hunters vs. Shadows) is trying to figure out their teammates while attacking the competition - and not revealing their identities.  Meanwhile a few neutral characters could be thrown into the mix with their own unique goals.

Besides trying to get help with attacks and defense, the crucial hermit cards allow players to get hints on other players.  But one more twist!  One player could be allowed to lie!

The subject matter may not appeal to everyone, but I was definitely impressed.  Would I choose this over the Resistance?  With experienced players, yes.  But you can't beat the latter for simplicity in teaching and speed of gameplay.

Love the theme.  The best games are those with 6+ players.  Seriously, this game should only be played with 8 if possible, and never less than 6.  EVER.  It is just soooo much better with more people!

Enjoyment comes more from the group you are playing with than from the game itself.  I have experienced great games where people take the time to try and figure out who the other characters are, and then I've had games where people just attack whoever they can whenever they can.  Games where people get into the spirit of the game are fun, whereas games where people just want to punch faces are lame.

Les instruccions diuen que és per 4-8 jugadors. Per 4 és molt just, perquè ràpidament trobes la identitat de tothom. Tal i com diuen als foros, millor jugar a partir de 6, especialment 7 o 8.

És un joc de personalitats ocultes amb ELIMINACIÓ. Per tant s'ha de jugar amb un grup adequat i conscient d'aquest 'ingredient' (si és així, aquest problema deixa de ser-ho), per evitar que algú mori aviat.

A 7-8 jugadors, resulta molt divertit i la paranoia i confusió que es crea és genial!. 

El joc es pot accelerar amb la norma de que cadascú comenci jugant una Hermit's Card (carta verda) i amb 1 punt de Mal (sinó hi ha algunes Hermit cards que no serveixen).

After a couple plays, I'm not really impressed. Having played The Resistance before getting this, the player elimination in this one really seems like a letdown. Also, there's a ton of randomness and a good part of the interest of the game is in the humor of the cards.

Another commenter summed it up perfectly:  "Nice concept, but ultimately too complex for a party game, too light for a gamer's game, and not tense enough for a hidden roles/traitor game."

I really like this one, but I find myself at a bit of a loss on exactly *how* to explain my liking of it. I first played it many years ago in college and took me years to find it again, thrilled I did. It's a hidden role game, where even you have no idea who's on what team, be they friendly or not or neutral. Everyone has their goal to win, and it's a real game of deduction, analyzing why someone played the way they did, fitting together pieces of knowledge to figure it out. Or some people are just random as hell which is fun! If you like Resistance, I'd say check it out.

RATING: 7
I think this does an admirable job of being a more interesting alternative to Bang! or Werewolf.   It's quicker and more fun than those games.   White cards protect and heal, black gives weapons and amps up the attack, while green helps by giving clues.   This seems like a good choice for a large group (6-7 players).   It's nothing you'd want to play over and over, but it fills its niche quite well and I liked it for that.  The anime flavor was a nice touch, too.

I had the same highly positive reaction to my first play of this as I did to the similar Shadows Over Camelot years ago. Shadows wore out on me after awhile, but this one appears to have more replay value. The wider variety of characters and multiple victory conditions adds an entirely new level of complexity to the psychology. And the game completes in about half the time. The random factor is quite high, but the game is so fun it's easy to ignore.

A social deduction that is very chaotic, random and far too long to have player elimination in it.  Perhaps it was better received ten years ago when it first came out, but it hasn’t aged very well at all.  Some of the characters are very unbalanced (the “neutrals” have a much easier time and just cause chaos for everyone else).  For a good social deduction game, try 2012’s “Samurai Sword” (the updated version of “Bang!”).   I have a feeling the only reason some players like it today is for nostalgia reasons, otherwise it’s time to retire ‘Shadow Hunters’ to the land of terminally out-of-print games.

After 1 play: I prefer my social deduction games quicker than an hour. I still think Werewolf Inquisition is the best social deduction "boardgame" out there. The roll and move aspect turned me off too. I could play it again, but first impression wasn't too great.

Terrific hidden-role game that shouldn't be taken too seriously.  The more players you add to the game, the better it gets as the deduction is the crux of it.  Once you're in the end-game, things will speed along as people start dying in droves.  Despite the 10-card expansion included in the new edition, I wouldn't mind seeing even more roles added to the game.

It's very dull.  There's too much luck involved with everything.  If you don't roll right, you won't land on the action spaces that are useful to your character, and even then you might not draw a useful card.  Even attacking people is luck-based.  It's one of those games where the "fun" is in indiscriminately attacking people even though it's counterproductive to most win-conditions.

RATING: 7
My first 4 plays were all from one gaming session, so knowing me, that says it's both fun and quick.  To me it feels a little like Cosmic Encounter since your options of who to attack is determined randomly and you have a special unique power.  I'm disappointed there are so few characters compared to the number of alien races in Cosmic Encounter, but it is a cheaper game and I like that you won't have a situation where everyone but one player wins.  The best part of this is trying to figure out who is on your side, who isn't and then dealing with them accordingly.  It's a great alternative for times when you don't have enough people to play Werewolves since it scratches a similar itch, however I wouldn't recommend it with less than 6 players.

Surprisingly fun and quick game. I am a sucker for whose-who games and this one does a great job of it without bogging things down with a heavy game. That said I guess I wish the game had just a few more characters and more 'action' cards.

After years of owning the game, it started to remind me too much of some flimsy Ameritrash games I'd had the displeasure of playing, so it was time to let go.

I had high hopes for this, but I did not like this game at all.  Maybe once you know the roles, and player chemistry might make a big difference, but I had a bad experience.

Beginning of game was blindly attacking people b/c you have no idea who is who.  If you happened to get on a green card, and if the green card is helpful, you can somewhat deduce information, but hopefully you figure out who is who before you die.  Very random and low fun factor.  Avoid.

(After [b]3[/b] plays) An attempt to take the hidden-role aspect of [GAMEID=925] and turn it into a physical boardgame. A relatively easy-going, low-stress addition to the genre. However, the compelling psychological aspect of Werewolf is extremely diluted here, with the result that the overall experience is not really demanding enough to command attention. 

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Nice concept, but ultimately too complex for a party game, too light for a gamer's game, and not tense enough for a hidden roles/traitor game.

Sleeper hit, at least for me.  This is a fantastic game of hidden identities, a bit of deduction, and machine guns.  It can be played in 30 or 40 minutes and even those who are eliminated are still in the game -- and enjoy watching, coaxing, etc.  This is a more the better sort of game, so with 4 it would not be much fun.

This is begging for an expansion.  More weapons, more characters, more everything!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this one for groups of 6-8. For a group of that size, It does a good job of providing some laughs and a bit of mystery with a modicum of rules. Sure, the mystery doesn't last too long, but it's there for the start. 

I find the neutrals the most interesting as they have unique winning conditions; too bad the hunters and the shadow don't as well instead of just killing each other. While the mystery evaporates by the end, the endgame is frequently entertaining enough as players desperately roll to find and attack each other. I've had some epic sessions where people were near death then fully healed for the comeback victory or where a neutral wins through some unique condition. I strongly recommend the expansion pack to add more characters to help keep things fresh.

RATING: 3
A riff off resistance which adds a flawed dice / card mechanic. Roll the dice, move to the relevant location and receive a card.

Aside from bluffing and deduction there are very few choices, so why include the dice and cards at all?

My go to hidden traitor game as it's rather light and doesn't require too much over-thinking.  It's a major plus that it plays 8 (or even 9).  I love that there's a mostly concrete way for deducing other people's identities that just about everyone should be able to do at least once.  If you don't like chance and don't want to feel that luck has had a hand in your win or loss, this is not the game for you. That being said, this game is a TON of fun for how light it is.  This game is dying for a full expansion, but I printed off the home brew characters posted here with Artscow and am quite happy with them.

Games that play 8 are hard to find.  A game of deduction where hidden identity characters try to discover which are their friends and foe, and to kill off the foe.  Fun, short, with easy rules and lots of player interaction.  People get killed and are out of the game, but people usually don't start dying till the end and the entire game only lasts 30-45 mins.  It helps to know the characters or at least have a crib sheet.  I also pass of paper & pencils for notes since it is a game of deduction.

EDIT:  This has stood the test of time--repeatedly this gets pulled off the shelf by my gaming group

Seems like a good filler for a large group with some interesting deduction elements.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In an earlier comment, I stated that Shadow Hunters was "one of those 'universal' games that will get pulled out at every game day," but that may not be going far enough. It's almost to the point that I might as well keep it in my car at all times. I can't think of a single other one of my "geek" games that has gotten this kind of universal approval. Our group could probably play 5 times in one day and not get bored with it.  

There are some issues with some of the characters: it's almost impossible to win as Charles or Bob (even when using the revised Bob from the [thing=34869]expansion[/thing]), and whomever gets dealt Allie at the beginning of the game is almost assured to get a share of the victory. (Of course, we have had a game now where Charles won and Allie was killed, so anything can happen!) 

Also, new players have taken a few turns to catch on to how the Hermit cards work. We've tried the optional rule where, at the start of the game, the group passes around one Hermit card and follows its instructions. This is an interesting, but not great idea: I'd like to try it again, though.  I also like the idea of a more randomized setup, where 9 characters cards are shuffled before an 8-player game (for example).

Best with 7-8 players, although 6 works. With 4-5 players, I'd rather play Bang!.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this game a lot for its light, fast play, the hidden identities, variable player powers, bluffing, and deduction of victory conditions. The card decks are small (the expansion adds nothing net!), but that keeps the streakiness under control.

The forced reroll if you roll your current location card is quite an annoyance that slows down the game. Some of the characters have unbalanced victory conditions (Allie can just reveal at the start...).
Production-wise, the text is small and hard to read for some, and you must read it to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much better than Bang! in my opinion.  The turns are somewhat longer, but the game is shorter and usually has more mystery.  The neutral characters are way better too.  My biggest problem is people always kill each other before they have any clue who people are.  That is what makes this game better than Bang! people!  You don't have to know who everyone is, but at least have an inkling before you blast away.

Dans mon avis à propos de "Munchkin", j'évoquais un décalage entre le format de la boîte qui faisait penser à un jeu d'ambiance (ce qu'il était dans l'idée) et la durée du jeu, trop longue. Pour "Shadow Hunters", on se retrouve un peu face au même trompe-l’œil, mais dans l'autre sens. C'est un jeu d'ambiance qui se joue vite (rarement plus de trente minutes) mais dont la taille de la boîte et le matériel laissent penser à un jeu plus costaud.

D'où une possible déception lors des premières parties pour des joueurs s'attendant à plus de subtilités. Pour ma part, je trouve que le contrat est tout à fait respecté et que les mécanismes mis en place collent à ce type d'objet ludique. C'est fun, ça cause autour de la table, ça crie à cause des jets de dé, ça cogne virtuellement, ça combine des effets improbables, ça bluffe, ça se regarde avec un air suspicieux... Bref, beaucoup d'interactions entre les joueurs, il faut trouver les bons pour que la partie prenne toute sa saveur, des gens qui jouent un minimum le jeu et s'investissent, sans quoi ça peut devenir d'un ennui mortel.

On assiste aussi à pas mal de retournements de situation, d'évolutions par la révélation (parfois posthume) des personnages, les effets spéciaux des neutres est, là aussi, ce qui donne un goût particulier au jeu qui sort un peu du manichéen "gentils contre méchants" moins savoureux. Il y a du hasard, on peut être vite éliminé et observateur pour le reste de la partie, on peut s'acharner sur un joueur qui n'a rien fait de particulier, mais au fond, pour ce format, ce n'est pas bien grave car la partie s'achève vite. Pareil pour les problèmes d'équilibre et les personnages plus puissants que les autres, ce n'est pas vraiment dommageable pour ce genre de jeu, selon moi, car ça ne vient pas pourrir une partie où tout le monde réfléchit à tout.

Bien que ce soit un jeu très accessible pour les joueurs désirant un minimum s'investir en tant qu'humains dans la partie pour la rendre intéressante, il n'est pas dénué d'intérêt et de subtilité. Il y a, comme je l'ai dit, une part de bluff, de timing (je me révèle ou non ?). On essaie aussi (parfois, quand tout le monde ne tape pas tout le monde), d'optimiser les informations afin de savoir qui est qui ou d'utiliser au mieux son pouvoir spécial.

Le nombre de joueurs indiqué sur la boîte est par contre un peu trompeur. Le jeu ne prend son ampleur et ne devient vraiment amusant qu'à partir de 5, et même de 6. Plus on est, mieux c'est. Mais là, contrairement à d'autres jeux qui tournent très bien au nombre minimum, ce n'est pas vraiment le cas, dommage.

"Shadow Hunters" est donc un bon jeu d'ambiance qui peut effrayer par son matériel mais qui, si on rentre dedans, peut être à la fois très amusant sans exclure quelques finesses que sauront exploiter les joueurs. Un très bon jeu à sortir entre deux plus lourds ou pour commencer/finir une soirée dans une bonne ambiance. Après, ce n'est pas vraiment mon genre de jeu préféré, mais je ne dis pas non avec une partie de temps à autre.

A really solid party game, and I like the way it combines the usual character-assigned-with-a-special-ability/identity-guessing-game with a board game, a health track, and combat.  It sets this game apart from the pack, and provides a few more gameplay mechanisms to keep things interesting.  I'll gladly take this over The Resistance, Avalon, Coup, and even Salem 1692.

The endgame is pretty silly, but it seems to be over quickly enough so it doesn't totally wear out its welcome.
Also, characters clearly aren't well balanced against one another in some cases.

This game doesn't do too much for me.  I've been around people who were enthusiastic as hell about it but I don't get it.  It isn't a terrible design and I do appreciate the effort--compress a secret info/werewolf kind of big game into a very short package.  But it ends up abstract and I felt that I was just blundering through the motions for the most part.

RATING: 6
Reasonable "hidden identity" game that is more deduction than Werewolf. But the dice rolling adds too much randomness, in a frustrating way that keeps you from doing anything you want to do. In both of my games, we knew who everyone was, so the fun part of the game was over, but we danced around the board not being able to attack our enemies and handing out useless Hermit cards. Eventually someone got lucky enough to kill someone and end the game.

Broken characters, pointless rolling ameritrash with broken cards, totally boring and frustrating for me, as there's almost no place for any strategy whatsoever besides the most primitive ones according to your given goal. Secret identities not well delivered, and "Neutrals" may be worse than Shadows, in the sense they fuck everything up for the rest of the players, so you should kill them most of the times, despite being "neutral", which doesn't make sense thematic-wise.
But for some misterious reasons, the groups I play it with seem to have fun, and I like the artwork, so a 4 it is. Could be worse.

Think "Bang! with most of the bad stuff taken out."  Less down time, no icon confusion, better balance, and more ability to deduce who's who.  The big difference is that in Shadow Hunters your actions and your attacks involve rolling dice instead of playing from a hand of cards.  There are cards in Shadow Hunters, but they're the "draw and play immediately" variety.  This change makes the gameplay much faster and smoother, although some may feel that it also eliminates most of the decision making.  On many turns you'll have just one decision to make: do I attack this person that I see nearby?  Or: which of these people that I see nearby should I attack?  I like it much better than Bang! but that's a low bar.

A crowd favourite in my local group. It can often get the adrenaline pounding, and people often get excited when certain items come out, but some of the magic dies when you realize that it is all essentially based on die rolls and getting a lucky character. Definitely not a game for highly competitive players prone to getting upset over optimization strategies, yet they seem to like it the most.

For best results, kill Allie as soon as possible.

4-8 Players.  This game is pure win.  It is simple and very easy to teach and have anyone come in and play.  It is strategic enough where you have to have a solid plan of finding out who is on what team while simultaneously not giving away your role.  Deceiving other people and getting them to second guess your loyalties is great fun.  The Unknown is the best role in the box.

The shared HP board is clever (with various characters' health totals marked on it so you can tell at a glance that somebody is one hit away from dying IF they're character A or B, but not C or D).

Supposed to be a boardgame version of Werewolf, this one just didn't work for me. The deduction element seemed minimized and replaced with just plain attacking. It's like Kutschfahrt, but after all the roles are revealed you still have to fight it out to the death.

An awesome semi-cooperative deduction game, with some similarities to Bang! but done a lot better, and with clue cards (called "Hermit Cards" in the game) to help identify who is on your team.

It scales pretty well from about 5 to 8 players, however it's one of those games that's definitely better with more people.

On paper it looks great, but I was actually a bit disappointed by this one: the best part is the beginning, where everyone tries to guess who's what; then it gets a bit boring: too much dice rolling, too much downtime, too long for what it has to offer (would be great if it lasted 20 min)...

The good: Fun game, lots of neat ideas, variable player powers, hidden roles, cool deduction element.  Plays well with a big group.

The bad: multiple winners and a game where whether you win or lose is dependent on the initial character draw at the beginning.  Should be some kind of tie breaker for the three winners.

Needs a big group; Note I played with four which may have negatively impacted my scoring / review of the game.

RATING: 8
This game is better than Bang. There, I got the inevitable comparison out of the way. It's a hidden role game where the focus is on killing the other people while doing a bit of "figuring out who people are." This is in sharp contrast to games like Werewolf or The Resistance where success is determined almost solely by bluffing and deduction. 

Shadow Hunters can be played at a lot of different levels. The more experience players have with the various POSSIBLE goals characters may have, the more opportunity for bluffing and deduction appears. Yet even with very little knowledge of the role cards, it can be played casually and feel a lot like Bang. It's a cleaner, less-convoluted design that gives players better incentives for various actions and gradually increases the amount of information available to players as the game goes on. 

There are some timing issues with the card play and the theme is not quite as relatable or evocative as Bang. Additionally, there are not as many card possibilities, either in decks or possible characters. These minor drawbacks aside, the overall experience is a definite improvement over Bang, especially at higher player counts where Bang tends to drag on interminably. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is what "Bang!" should have been all along. Crazy fun, not dictated by what cards you draw but by whatever you want to do on your turn (well, except for the fact that you usually can't freely move). There are ways to deduce another players loyalty and there are no silly "I shoot you" - "I block" loops ad inifnitum. Yeah, well, okay, it's lucky as hell, but in a game that lasts twenty to thirty minutes, I don't mind it that much.

RATING: 7.6
     This game sits somewhere in-between lighter hidden team games like The Resistance and Werewolf and heavier ones like Shadows or BSG.  
     The neutral characters with special winning conditions give it some extra goodness.  
     It can be very simple to deduce who is which character, especially if someone reveals themselves.  
      I enjoyed it, and the short amount of time it took means it left a good taste in my mouth.

Kind of a cross between Bang and The Resistance. Like Bang, the arbitrary hoseage can really bring it down. Also, dice and luck of the draw play a large part. Getting those good green cards is so key. 

I could see this moving up to a six, because I didn't hate it. But the first game left a bad taste in my mouth after some jerk arbitrarily hosed me pretty much out of contention. With different players, maybe it gets better. Can't see it moving up very far though.

Shadow Hunters is a loyalty based board game. It's the heavily inferior version of Battlestar Galactica, although at least it is more simple.

Thematically, it looks really cool because there's a lot of weird stuff going on, and the art is fantastic.

Its flaw however, is that the game is a Loyalty based game, with no interaction or dialogue between players necessary at all. You may accuse, but there is very little of it in a game where there should be a lot.

Werewolf is a simpler game that does it better, and Battlestar Galactica is a more complex game that does it better. There isn't a reason to play Shadow Hunters. It's still a fine game on its own though.

This is a stupid-fun game. It was interesting enough and quick enough that our meetup played it twice this evening. The early part of the game is trying to find out who your partners are through the use of hermit cards, and then equipping your character with stuff. Sort of like Clue, or Shadows Over Camelot, since you don't know who is on your team, so there is lots of paranoia.  With five, it only took two-three turns to find out who everybody was. We played with eight, which definitely had the expected tension, but there was some downtime because of number, even if the game mechanics are quick.

FINALLY—a short, fun, thematically interesting game for large groups.  Whenever we hit 6, 7 or 8p, no one wants to break up into two games for fear of being stuck at the "unfun" table.  This usually means we get stuck playing the suck.  What, exactly?  I dunno,  but whatever it was, it wasn't memorable.

Many have been calling this a better [gameid=3955], and indeed, it is.

With 6-8 people (a hard number to find good games for) this game is better than anything else I've tried, including the resistance. Rarely suffers from early player elimination, plays quickly, and is very simple (Move - Do Something - Attack) and easy for anyone to pick up and learn. A great party game, and probably a good game to use to introduce people to gaming, though I have yet to test that theory.

Gets a 9 for 6-8 players due to the limited options at that count, otherwise a 7.

Lighthearted, short deduction game.  Player elimination is present but it is short enough to save that from being a HUGE problem (though it is still, you know,player elimination).  Players are on teams and must figure out who is on their side, with a great deal of bluffing and confusion possible--but it always becomes obvious by the end.  There seems to be quite a bit of variability and the items you can collect are cool, though it would be nice to have more ways of manipulating the outcomes of combat.

1x10^24 times better than Bang (but not THAT similar).

Dec08: Well, I don't really like most Werewolf / Mafia games.  Did this one change my opinion?  No.  Not really at all.

For one, the characters were all a little too messy.  Maybe if you played it multiple times you'd all get a feel for them.  But in the first pass, the paragraphs of text on each character were far too much information to parse for a 30 minute game.

I also really prefer simultaneous actions for a 6+ player game.  I know I'm supposed to be paying attention to know who's with who.  But when they're all just attacking because they can, then it's just not worth it much.

The Hermit cards were a welcome change though.  Of course, out of 10 played, I think 3 were interpreted incorrectly.  Not everybody is good at digesting two tier and/or logic conditions.

So overall?  Meh.

I like hidden role games (Criminals, Werewolf, Kutschfahrt) which is why I own this game. I like the ambiguity of the early game where the attacking is rare (this game is far superior to Kutschfahrt in this regard in my experience) and I really like the intensity of the end game where the roles are known and it's usually down to 2 or 3 players battling for good or for evil. You will have people rooting you on with fervor and others detesting your name with venom. It's easy to learn and teach and is over pretty quick; perhaps a bit too quick actually.

As I am not a fan of social games (I am an awful liar), I was highly skeptical of this one.

Sweet spot for players is definitely 6.

The game offers exactly what one would hope for in a hidden-role elimination game: fun, light, quick games with lots of carnage and some random humor for good measure. While I agree with others that the player pieces aren't exactly the best, the other components are fine. I love the anime theme and artwork of the cards (even though I'm not a big anime fan) and feel it's perfectly suited for this type of game. Each character plays differently, and the ability to deduce player roles in an indirect manner boosts this game over other similar games. It's perfect for a group of between 4-8 people, and I bet it could even accommodate more without too much trouble. A very nice, solid game.

RATING: 9
Too random?  hah, well so is werewolf and any game like this (though I can see where people are pointing to here, could be even more chaotic and what is with all the dice rolling?) Would like to try anyway, better than Bang most likely (not hard to do though) but it looks like the Resistance in particular (faster, no dice rolling so a boiled down system that still has some deduction) or maybe Kutschfahrt might already do this better.

EDIT - Have now played it 3 times and its an excellent game, possibly the best of this type yet. 

Love the simple yet very effective combat element, rolling a 6 sided and 4 sided die together and subtract the difference brilliant, seems to average about 1 or 2 in damage, sometimes none and sometimes 3 to 5 and of course its just random but it works well. Cards in the game work very well also, green cards slowly funnel info into the game, black weapon cards usually help and white special cards usually help but sometimes can be bad so a little risky taking them.  Even the characters were well thought out, during the game you can usually deduce who is who just by watching what is happening (though its easier figuring out who is on whos team rather than exactly who they are which is perfect) but you usually never do know anything in the game for certain as there are always little built-in doubts. The 'Unknown' character is the perfect example, out of the 10 original characters this one is allowed to lie about his identity, so every game there is a 1 in 10 chance someone is always lying about their identity, again brilliant I think.  

Overall this is one of the best games of this type and one of the best for giving you actual info to work with. Very easy to learn and simple ruleset so very non-gamer friendly in that regard. WW has a very different feel in that psychology plays a much much bigger role as do accusations and trash talk and this game style is still one of my ultimate favs as well (and it scales to much bigger groups, this is likely best with 6 and the number I played with). There is easily room for both of these in my collection, great stuff.

RATING: 5.5
This game is fine, it's not really much of a deduction game, mostly just a silly collect weapons and beat everyone up game with a dusting of deduction. So basically it fits a similar niche to BANG! but I'd say this game does it in a much more fun way. I felt pretty consistently engaged in what was happening but at the end of the day there's not much game here, you roll dice to decide where to go and then maybe get to hurt or heal someone. Then can choose to try to hurt someone who happens to be nearby to you.

Shadow Hunters has some great ideas about how to make a hidden role game - but the high degree of luck and limits on player actions disrupt the potential fun. Too many games end without acquiring useful information, being unable to act on that useful information, or just being the target of a random attack that makes it nigh impossible for the player (and potentially anyone on the player's side) to win.

I'm generally favorable to hidden role games, but this game somehow leaves me feeling flat.  Maybe it's because the roles aren't very balanced, and my first game or two was with difficult roles.  Maybe it's because you can get stuck for long periods of time without the ability to gain information about your opponents.  Still, I don't hate the game.

An okay deduction werewolf style game. Some mistranslations in the Medical Kit item made some games pretty broken (for clarity the Medical Kit cannot bring your health down, it can only heal you). Fun the first couple of times but it depends on who you're playing with.

Gets a bit samey after a couple of games and takes too long for what it is at least for my taste.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (October 2010)

Shadow Hunters is a good game, it is very simple to teach, has few rules, plays relatively quickly and (with the right group) can be very fun. My favorite mechanic in games is Hidden Roles and in this game you have to find your teammates (if any) and try to survive until the end. The hermit cards are great to play, but in general, it is pure luck if you can access them or not. 

On the negative side, the attacks and movement are done through dice, this adds a lot of (unwanted for me) randomness and it is the main reason I don’t rate the game higher. It features player elimination, but as the game (generally) plays quickly, I don’t mind much. The orange and red pawn are too similar and hard to distinguish. Also I have a concern of the balance of some characters.

In conclusion, Shadow Hunters is a good game, I prefer it over Bang and Cash & Guns. But if I want to play hidden role games, I will play BSG (If I have the time) or The Resistance and Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg (if I have a short time span).

I'm not sure what I think of this game yet.  It's very quick, which is good.  The secret partnerships are interesting.  In the 4-player game we quickly figured them out though.  I should play at least once more with a better player number.

I ought to like this - it somewhat resembles BSG but with a less appealing theme and not nearly as much buildup.  It deserves at least one more chance from me.

Update 10/2010:  MUCH better with 6.  I think it would overstay its welcome if I played too often but as an occasional large player-count filler it deserves a place at the table.

RATING: 8.8
A really, really great game. I was very surprised, actually. The rules seemed a bit "loose," and I wasn't sure it would be all that good. But this is one fantastic game. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the "figure out identities" mechanic might be my favorite new development in games. If you're a fan of Shadows Over Camelot or Werewolf/Mafia, this is for you! (Played with 6 and 8 players. Worked perfectly!)

RATING: 7.5
20 plays in, and still loving it (just upped it to a 9), as are the great majority of the people with whom I've played it. Play with people who don't demand a focus on logistical efficiency from their games and who enjoy a little characterful table-talk and you won't go wrong.

A lot of luck here, but a tremendous amount  of fun too. Lies within the hidden-role genre populated by the likes of Werewolf, Bang, and Saboteur, but with some neat time-capping mechanisms in there. (For me, Werewolf and - in particular - Bang can overstay their welcome at times).

This is a pretty fun social deduction game. The deduction is less about reading the other players, though, and more about making use of the scraps of information that you can tease out through card play. I could do without the player elimination, but it doesn't ruin the game. We had a lot of players go for the black and white decks at every opportunity, instead of utilizing the green deck early on, which I think dragged the game out a bit. All on all a fun game, though.

RATING: 6
Everyone takes a secret identity and becomes part of one of three groups - Hunters, Shadows or Neutrals. By moving to locations, playing cards, and observing the behavior of others, you try to deduce who your friends and enemies are and attack or help accordingly. The action is heavily dictated by cards and dice. The game is fun, but the high level of chance involved, especially early, saps much of the tension and bluffing that I'd expect in a game like this. I'm not usually bothered by downtime, but for some reason I felt myself getting a little impatient when it wasn't my turn. Still, might be worth keeping for the shortish play time and the high player count.

RATING: 10
I like this game a lot, but I understand why some people hate it so much. The unbalanced characters don't bother me. I feel that the unbalancing makes the game more tense and force players to correctly time reveal their characters. 

I like the randomness with the items, but incorporated a house rule to where players can hold on to one instant card, but have to choose which one happens if they pull another instant card.

In Shadow Hunters you assume the guise of a Hunter, a Shadow, or someone caught in the middle. You need to figure out who's who and then scramble to strike down your enemies. An arsenal of crazy equipment streams into the game, with some players smiting each other with cursed swords and cleavers while others put their backs to the wall and blaze away with .45s. You will survive longer if you can conceal your identity, but if you reveal yourself, you may sate your vampire's thirst, or bloody your werewolf's claws, or...

Now I know what some of you are thinking. You're thinking, "I've played this game with a different theme, and it sucked." Don't let that discourage you. The mechanics here defy precedent by actually working. The deduction, the movement, the locations, the equipment, the combat: it works. None of this "I was eliminated before my first turn" nonsense.

The clincher is that you need 6-8 players for Shadow Hunters to shine (I suspect 6 is best). Bean-trading and path-finding are fun and all, but a heavy dose of unrestrained fantasy violence can't hurt, right?

Shadow Hunters is another cooperative-style board game, with a strong deduction mechanic. Each player is assigned a unique and hidden role, in which he or she is part of either the villagers, the hunters or the monsters. Through play of cards you try to deduct who is on what team, and you try to let your team win by meeting certain end-game conditions. It's definitely not the best in its kind, but it is certainly a very enjoyable experience.

Finally, I found the Werewolves-type game that does it for me. I had enjoyable Werewolves games a long time ago but it’s too dependent on the right group of players which I don’t have. The Resistance was a step into the right direction but after a few initial plays it didn’t hit the table again. Not enough fun included. Battlestar Galactica has too much overhead and is too long for the limited amount of gameplay.

Jäger der Nacht strikes the right balance between rules overhead, playing time, amount of information and fun. A pity that it took two years from buying to finally getting it on the table. I don’t even mind the lackluster young adult theme of Werewolves against Vampires and the uneven artwork in the German version.

I enjoy playing Shadow Hunters more than the Resistance... but... but it's a significantly worse game. There is minimal strategy and the art/theme is downright awful by 2017 standards. The only saving grace is that feeling of realization that you were attacking or hurting your teammate and the fact that the cards are very swingy. Sometimes you will end up simply hurting yourself and other times you will heal completely from near death. 

But don't buy this in 2017... don't even play it. Get something that is actually a good game. This shouldn't rate in the top 1000 (and this is coming from someone who kind of enjoys it).

RATING: 7
I've bumped down the rating of this a little bit.  I still a very good game.  However, at the same time it does have some flaws.

* A person who's new and gets confused can cause a lot of chaos.

* I have the expansion, but I'm starting to get tempted to remove it for games with lots of new players or also just not play with certain characters.

* Ideally this woudl be a good game for more players, but I've discovered sometimes there's just not enough information and for whatever reason not many green cards come up.  

Starting with some green cards can help, although it makes the game a lot easier. Might try that you can hold one in reserve...

Also, one other gripe.  The colors of the wooden pieces for pink, orange,  and red are confusing as all get out.  I'm tempted to either color the pawns with paint myself or replace them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is essentially a guessing game. Very simple, very stripped down, no complexity. Players belong to 1 of 3 factions (Shadows, Hunters or Neutrals) and have to achieve a victory condition to win. 

It has the same amount of complexity as a Werewolf game, but some additional cards to help move the game along by helping players make deductions. Its quite a good game, my only concern would be the lack of replayability because of the fixed number of characters.

Shadow Hunters takes the sexy hidden role mechanic of Werewolf and tries to set her up on a date with a somewhat ho-hum dude who thinks he's still, like, a rocker (namely, the adventure roll-n-move thang from the likes of Talisman, Descent...or pick your poison).  The result is a fairly awkward first date in which the best elements of each mechanic are diminished and...well, everyone goes home before dessert is served.

Whatever, this metaphor sucks.  The point is, if you like Werewolf, you should play Werewolf; if you like roll-n-move-n-hack-n-slash adventure, you should stick to dedicated adventure games.... In Shadow Hunters the random acts of violence and the random movement around the board make role play a less invested part of the game, and, likewise, the fact that you can't just hack away at baddies with your friends (because your friends might be the baddies) dilutes the adventure.

That said, the amount of time this game takes (30-45 min) is just about right if you're looking for a longer, less intense version of Werewolf or a shorter, less fun version of adventure gaming.

But I could see it working very well as a quick, light and fun game to start or end an evening. It's a great game to pull out if you have 6 - 8 players and are not sure what to do with them.

Shadow Hunters is based entirely on luck. The strategy element is only available if you roll the number you need on the dice. Even then, you might not be able to attack who you want to or you might draw a card you don't need. For fans of Machi Koro and other mostly-luck/some/strategy games.

RATING: N/A
Shadow Hunters is a survival board game set in a devil-filled forest in which three groups of characters – the Shadows, creatures of the night; the Hunters, humans who try to destroy supernatural creatures; and the Neutrals, civilians caught in the middle of this ancient battle – struggle against each other to survive.

You belong to one of these groups and must conceal your identity from others since you don't know who you can trust – at least not initially. Over time, though, someone might decipher who you are through your actions or through Hermit cards, or you might even reveal yourself to use your special ability.

The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early because once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack with impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious – or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.

RATING: 8.5
Wow!  This is a simplistic game that is different each time we play it!  We love it, and various ages we have introduced it to love it also!  Only problem is that the game really isn't that interesting until you have 5+ players.  We need the expansion now to add some more characters to the mix.

A deduction, survival game. Each player is trying to achieve their own win condition while learning other players' identity. Some tabletalk is required, but can be played without any.

Played three times, 5p, 6p, 7p.  So, this is Bang! with more control.  Or a more constrained Werewolf.  Whatever.  I am not the target audience for this game.

There are some interesting elements in this game, but it's really an unfinished game. It's like if they found 1 good mechanic and then released the game.

First I don't like the fact that you roll to move, first it's stupid, and second it does not give you power over the game. So you do not feel like you are investigating or hunting. Instead, they should have placed a small city or area map where you can move and where you try to hunt other players by moving on their spot.

The investigation mechanic is OK, still if you use too much green cards, you might need to use pen and paper to keep track of the information. But since most players don't do it and can reveal them self, it's like if half of the investigation feeling is there.

So good concept that needs to be refined.

-----------------------------------

Played another time today, not much fascinating. There is a memory aspect to the game which is important to guess who is who. Some compared this game as a simplified version of bang. I agree with that, some features are more elegant than bang and it plays much faster. But still, I consider a lot of meat is lacking to this game.

RATING: 8
A light, fast-paced "deductive elimination" game that is best played with large party crowd of 6 or more, in 30 - 60 mins.  Everyone plays a "hidden" character role.  There are creatures made of Shadow and their main goal is to kill (especially Hunters).  Then there are The Hunters, whom are trained heroes and arch-nemesis of the Shadow.  There are also civilians in between, and these Neutral people have their own Individual goals.  There are 6 locations that could help all these players and each is paired randomly with another location or adjacent to the other, making three pairs of areas.  These areas are where players can visit and draw information and items (cards from the White, Black or Hermit decks) to help you deduce Who is Who?, Which are your teammates?, Which players are from which faction?  It's ideal to determine who is on your team as this may help you achieve your winning condition.  There are game elements that reminds me of Werewolf and also of Bang! (which I'm not a big fan of) but this survival game has more strategies for real bluffing & deductive gameplay.  Observing players (like Werewolf/poker) is also suitable and what they choose as their actions or what they do not do will help you narrow down who is possibly playing which faction (or even which role).  Unlike Bang! or Werewolf, you do not have to attack players before you develop an idea of which team they are on.  Lots of laughter and gaming banter, so it's perfect for the right group of light-hearted/party gamers.

This game requires an aggressive group for full enjoyment...and speedy play.  Otherwise, it just drags.  As such, I gave away my copy to a friend who was interested.  

Enjoyable, quick playing group game which plays 5-8 very well.  There are three different groups with neutrals playing for themselves really.  Hunters win if they kill all the shadow and vice versa.  Each character has special powers.  Interesting blend of bluff, deduction, and powering up with cards.

High quality components and art and quite thematic, but this game's "deduction" is rather light, in fact it would be basically nonexistent without the neutral characters throwing a monkey wrench, since there is very little incentive to bluff and not attack someone once you find out they are the opposite faction. Once everyone knows who everyone is, this game basically becomes a dicefest.

The newest small group social deduction game in my collection, Shadow Hunters lets me fulfill all of my neutral desires in an action packed game. The variety of roles and cards are just fantastic, and while there isn't really a theme to get into, it's pretty much just murdering everyone but making sure that it won't hurt you. Everyone feels like a mercenary, regardless of your team.

A light hidden-roles team game that tends to stay moving at a reasonable pace. The good guys and bad guys seem fairly balanced, if by the fact that players with neutral roles seem more inclined to ally against the bad guys (who are individually absolutely more powerful). One or two of those neutral roles, though -- sorry, boy-o, you're not winning this round.

The dribs and drabs of information parceled out by the green question cards are lots of fun, but this game is sufficiently light that I find it much more expeditious to start swinging at people and seeing what happens.

A social deduction game where there are three teams, shadow players, hunters and neutrals.  It is like Samurai Sword and the Resistance but there is more card play and more options.  I liked it ok, but I would prefer Samurai Sword and the Resistance.  

It is a little darker theme and I could take it or leave it.  The game is sound and ok, but not better than other better social deduction games and this is harder to play with non-gamers.

Really like the theme and the way this plays. Shame it needs 4+ people but this is great for ganging up on the other team. Players need to realise that it is important to keep secret.

Not for people who dont like direct conflict - One player really disliked this because of the direct player interaction.

Play as one of 3 factions:  The Hunters trying to eliminate the Shadows; the Shadows trying to eliminate the Hunters or three Neutrals; or the Neutrals which each have their own goals.  Everyone who's goal is fulfilled when the game ends (even if they've been eliminated prior to that) wins.  The catch is everyone's alligence is secret until they choose to reveal, or you play enough green cards to figure it out.  One Shadow is capable of lying when green cards are played though!  Fun, intrigue, and genearlly awesome game.

Too much of a luck-fest; dice and cards often dictate action. Choices of target depend on dice placing you in good spot. Dice determine damage/battles once roles are known. Also roles really don't seem balanced (e.g. item collector never got farther than one item in all the games we played).

I had okay amount of fun, but you really can't take this game seriously --- just go with the flow.

Just awesome. I love secret roles and variant objectives. The rules are really simple to teach and everyone I've taught it to has picked it up and jumped right in after the first turn.

RATING: 5.04
Had some hope based on people talking about it on BGG. It's an OKish deduction game that mostly suffers from the poorly implemented damage aspect. The fact that there is player elimination pours gasoline on it. Players are in a sense pushed to start openly attacking each other even before they have a chance to really deduct much of anything about them. If they are to wait, they need to do so after dice are rolled their way enabling it to happen. If the dice keep pushing them to attack, you attack or don't. If you don't, the game drags.

This had genuine potential but failed to live up to it.

Played at DaveCon 2012.

Rating Potential: 5-6. Need more plays of it. I think playing in the right group will really help. If you are stuck with people who simply walk though the game with little thought, it will suck. I honestly want to like this game. I think somebody eventually takes this game, reworks the damage aspect, and has a hit on their hands.

I like this game and its potential! First time I introduce a group, I don't share all the character abilities. Makes for more drama when people realize who can do what. Played this in France once or twice and had a ball! Always love to pull this one out.

A great light social deduction game. I've introduced it to people who haven't played much in the way of gamers games and it's gone down well. Sure, there's a player elimination element (unlike [thing=41114][/thing]), but it's a short game so it's not a big deal (as opposed to with [thing=38159][/thing]). Also, there's more information available than in other social deduction games because of the hit point track, which helps with new player acceptance and puts a slightly different emphasis on play style.

Good: 
Unique take on the hidden role games. The good and evil team win if they eliminate each other where the neutral team has unique objectives depending on what was dealt. 

Bad: 
Component quality is on the lower end. The artwork is lackluster, the card stock is flimsy, board design is uninspired. 

Playing this is entertaining but its tough getting folks interested when newer games have a much better graphical presentation.

Pacifists may have a hard time with this one.  For those that aren't worried of stepping on a few toes, this one's a blast!  While 4-player games eliminate a lot of guesswork, it's still quite fun.  Highly recommend this game for deduction and timing aspects due to revelation and plans of attack.  While items incorporate luck, it makes quite the tale afterwards.  Fantastic game!

Cool take of the Werewolf family of games. Players have identities that are secret along with a power. You can use that power but then you'll be exposed (of course someone else might take care of this for you). Basically each player has a number of hit points and if you're exposed or if someone suspects you the enemy team can start piling on you.

A valid attempt at fixing games like Werewolves/Mafia. Forces people to actually and openly do something, rather than rely on things they may have heard "at night" in W/M.

Thought that the character who can heal herself and win alone was a bit strong. Same goes for some of the items.

Personal minus: Got killed despite being able to lie for a green(?) card question cause the person misunderstood the meaning of yes and no.

RATING: 6
Average all around (I don't mean that in a bad way), but soooooo unbalanced, sooo random. I don't mind randomness in my games usually, the main thing being the duration of the game: the longer it runs, the more it will bother me if it has too much random stuff. 

This is not the case; it's usually a 30 minute game at most with 5 or 6 people, but it's still so unbalanced... just bear in mind that. 
If you won't get upset with a guy you almost killed (with help from a third person) drawing a card that gets him back to full health, and then another one that cripples you both, while you get crappy equipment... (and because such a series of events you die) then enjoy. It can be fun. Just be ready for that sort of thing.

RATING: 7
Shadow Hunters is an improvement over Bang!, but not much of one.  Like Bang! everybody is given a role and nobody knows who's who.  There are shadows, hunters, and neutrals.  The hunters win if they kill the shadows, the shadows win if they kill the hunters and each neutral role has it's own win condition.  One wins if he is still alive, one wins if he can kill himself, etc.

The thing I like about this over Bang! is they've added a better mechanism to know who is on your team.  On your turn you roll the dice to see what area you go to, these do things like add equipment, help heal you, hurt other people, etc.  A couple of the spots allow you to draw from the green deck which helps you figure out who people are.  You read the card, it might say, I think you're a hunter, if you are take one damage.  Then you choose another player and give them the card.  If they are a hunter, they will give themselves one damage, if not they won't.  So you can start learning about the other players, but nobody else knows what is written on the card.  Another way to figure out who somebody is, is if they reveal themselves.  At any time you can reveal yourself, and you can then use your special ability.  So you really only want to do this if your team keeps attacking you, or if you are in dire straights and really need to use your ability.  But now everybody knows who you are.

After you go to a spot, if there is somebody in the same area you can attack them.  Each role has a spot on the track where they die because of the damage and then they reveal themselves so everybody knows who they were.  This goes on until somebody hits their win condition.

I think I went into this game with a bad attitude, mostly because I was told it was like Bang!.  I still found it was too difficult to really know who was on my team, I only found out at the end of the game when we won, even though I was the first to be killed.  I might need to give this another try and it could go up to a 5, but a 4 for now seems good.

"I played this game 7P, and it was excruciatingly slow .. Bang! Dice does this much better, being a very light game, and plays quickly. Unfortunately, Shadow Hunters does not play quickly, and I cannot see myself playing it at 7P, and I'm not even sure if I'd play it at any other player count. Maybe at 4, if asked."

Ehhh...I'm no fan of hidden role games. Surely this has to be one of the best, as you actually get real information to go on (yet it remains secret across teams, which is clever). Player elimination, unbalanced powers/cards, swingy die rolls, all counts against it. It's "okay."

UPDATE: I'm going to DRASTICALLY raise my rating.  I started this at 4.5, but that was when my gaming group was just randomly shooting everyone from the start.  Now we've learned: everyone started the game by collecting weapons and trying to get information (via green cards), and only started fighting once people knew information.  It's now a great semi-deduction game where you have to play the cards right so you stay alive until you can go WHAM! and win at the end.  With the right group of people, this is a thoughtful, challenging game, and I love it.  With the wrong group, it sucks.  

This game is somewhat like Werewolf - players are assigned a role by a randomly-dealt card, and then they play as that role during the game.  Unlike Werewolf, however, the game has mechanisms for players to figure out who everyone is: on your turn you roll dice, which moves you to various positions on the board.  Those positions allow you to draw cards that have many uses, many of which help you identify whether someone is an ally or not.  

Players' goals in the game depend on the role card they're dealt: some players want to kill all their in-game enemies, others just want to survive or die, and others just want to collect equipment.  This range of victory conditions makes the game enjoyable.  

However, the problem we had in our games was that players didn't care about identifying each other.  On the first few turns of the game nobody knows anything about other players, yet everyone except me just randomly attacked whoever they could.  This meant that by the time people could have known the identities of possibly one or two players (if they'd been playing smart), half the table was dead, and the other half was close to it.  This made the game very random - whoever happened to be the early target died, and whoever was their opponent just happened to win. 

So, this could be a great game, but it would require both banning attacking other players for the first round or two, and then increasing the ability of players to identify each other's roles (e.g., by dealing out one or two green cards to each player at the start of the game).

As it is though, at least with my group it's terrible.

Sounds fun and easy to learn. Want to play, just trying to get the 6+ people together.

Really simple, quick and fun. Ugly box art.

Shines with 6-8 players. This has gone over well with everyone I've shown it to so far. It changes dramatically depending on the disposition of the players at the table. I tend to take lots of hermit cards early and try to get an idea of who is who. Some players just gear up and start smacking people. Then again, sometimes you'll get a character where gearing up and indiscriminately attacking others is the best course of action...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
7/27/2017 - Honestly, this has become my favorite game: the one I will choose over all others.  It's best at 7-8 players, where there's the maximum amount of deceit and confusion.  The artwork is strange and muddy and the printing is hard to read, but if you like hidden role games, this one is awesome.  No one knows who their teammates are and you have to stumble around getting clues from cards and player behavior.  Sometimes you just have bad luck and end up dead before you even know who's who.  Sometimes you come to the wrong conclusion and kill your friend instead of your enemy.  Sometimes you're just a neutral character just trying to live.  You never know how any game will unroll.               

Hidden role game.  Pretty fun.  

New update:  I finally gave in and just bought the thing after realizing that when it's available I tend to pick this game over all others.  At last week's gaming night, I could have played other games, but instead sat there all night just playing this.  

What I would definitely change if I could:  the cards/colors are so dark.  I find it hard to read the text.  If it were up to me, there would be better contrast on the printing for legibility.

Lowered rating from 6 to 4. My tastes have changed, and I find I really don't enjoy hidden role/guessing games anymore. In this game, you're ostensibly trying to ferret out who's who, find your allies and collaborate with them to win the game. But everyone really just wants to win individually, and the game invariably just turns into attacking random people in the hopes of being the last man standing. The deduction element of the game is just too weak and unreliable. The best you can really do is to end up with a vague (and probably wrong) idea of who your friends and enemies are. Then you go off and attack the people you think are your enemies, but more often than not, you and your allies have gotten it wrong, and end up attacking the wrong people. The people who love this game are not concerned with that, and think of it as just a run romp. If that floats their boat, then hey, more power to them. But it does nothing for me anymore.

Weird game. I always hate games which have a player draw and play a card during their turn because the game usually drags to a halt. Why not have the player draw a card at the end of their turn and play it the next turn, thus giving the player time to read the card and decise what to do with it? This didn't bother me much here however, probably because the game is otherwise pretty fast.

Mechanics are a bit clunky, the secret identity part didn't have much effect on the game and the neutral side felt pasted on. Still, for some reason I liked this somewhat.

As a big fan of Bang! it was pretty much a given that I would enjoy another game with hidden identities, team play, with plenty of "take that".  The main advantage of Shadow Hunters over Bang! is that it is much easier to teach new players. Bang! has a lot of cards that require explanation.  Shadow Hunters is pretty self explanatory. The process of figuring out who is on your team is also more straight forward via the use of the green Hermit cards. There is certainly room for more of these types of games on my shelf.

Very similar to games like Bang! and Good Cop, Bad Cop. This one is much more random, however. Your turn consists of rolling dice to move, (usually) drawing and resolving a random card, and then rolling dice to deal damage to another character. The game also features the chance for shared victories, even across different factions, which isn't something I'm a fan of. Really, the best thing this game has going for it is how many it can play in such a short period of time. I enjoy the game, but I'd rather play others in the same genre.

This is the perfect balance between Battlestar Galactica's overwhelming heaviness and The Resistance's barebones approach. Very fun and addictive.

Only played with 4 players so far, which made determining people's roles relatively simple. I don't like player elimination in games as I hate having a player have to sit back and watch other continuing the fun. However, this game's so fast playing that it doesn't hurt it too much.

All in all, a great game if you like hidden role games. Particularly as the two factions are pretty evenly matched unlike the typical "hunt the traitor" type of hidden role games.

Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.

Finally purchased--need to play this game!

I've played this game now and it compared to Samurai Sword in some ways and what I suspect BANG the bullet is like. I like it a lot. It's not as strong as Resistance but it's different enough that they're both worthwhile. Like Samurai Sword this game combines the social/bluffing game with the traditional board game.

With all the dice rolling and card drawing, it can feel like you don't have much control over the game.  However, it offers a similar experience to Bang while being quicker and less complicated.  Like most hidden team affiliation games, it needs more players to really shine.

RATING: 5
Played this game a couple times at a gamers' meetup. Its fine. I like that there's 3 different hidden role groups, and I like the deduction and guesswork in a lot of them. There's been some games with really exciting finishes too, like one where I was the last hunter fighting against two shadows, and I was 2 HP from dying, yet I managed to beat both of them! Stuff like that is pretty cool, and I especially like the anime art, since I used to watch a lot of anime.

Still, there's some things holding me back about the game. Its a lot of roll and move, where you could just get screwed over. The hermit cards are the main way to find an identity, yet you can roll around and just not get them. Some win conditions are just random, like "be the first to die", which you can't really know about while you're attacking the player. Some abilities are really powerful, like the vampire's ability to heal 2 damage, while others like "Set an HP to 7" require good timing to be decent. There's also some really swingy cards in the deck, like "If you're a Shadow, fully heal" and such, which can drag out the game. This is exacerbated by the player elimination.

Overall, I like a lot of the ideas in the game but think there are other Hidden Role Games that do it better or just are better for what they are. I'll play this when asked, but given the choice, there's many other games I'd prefer.

Plays: 6+ (probably way more)

A nice, streamlined hidden roles game that has enough game to keep things from becoming purely chaotic. The rub is that the roles here are not very well hidden, and usually within a few times around the table it will be obvious whom everyone is playing. At this point, the game boils down largely to dice luck, but there's some satisfaction to be had when you beat the odds. One of the better games in the genre.

RATING: 10
The resistance, werewolf, bang! and all the other social deduction games can not hold a candle to Shadow Hunters. This game is the only social deduction game that has been a hit with every group who has played it. I feel the fighting mechanic sets it apart. Making Shadow Hunters actually feel like a game with real choices to make. Also the hermit cards actually give a person an idea of who they should go after instead of just blazing away.

Glad I got a chance to play Shadow Hunters, as purchasing it would have been a mistake. My reservations about the game were accurate. Dice-rolling for combat, emphasis on player elimination, hidden identities; all not my cup of tea.

Furthermore, although I can see how the introduction of the Neutral personalities added balance to the game, playing one is a boring, solitary experience.

Oh, and the 4-sided die is even worse than a standard 6. It doesn't roll as much as skid across the table.

Love this game.  The hermit cards make this hidden role game stand well above others like Bang in my opinion.  The art can be polarizing because it is an Anime style and some characters are more clothed than others and the theme is a bit dark so if those are issues for you them look it over before buying.  For me this makes Shadow Hunters a weird conglomerate of quirky art, theme and mechanisms that comes together in a beautiful chaotic and most importantly FUN way.

Very fun hidden-role game that is easy to teach to non-gamers. Plays quick with experienced people too.

Although one should be cagey and try to determine alignments, it's just more fun to attack everyone! Unfortunately this makes strategizing difficult, so it's more an experience than a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
The components are nice, but I don't like its graphic design (for no special reason, it's simply unappealing).

It is a really simple hidden roles game: Each turn you roll dice and go to 1 of 6 locations and do its associated action. These actions can be drawing cards from a specific deck, steal items, heal 1 damage point or cause 2 damage points. You can also attack someone in that location or the neighbouring location.

There are Hunters, Shadows and Nuetrals. Hunters win if they kill all Shadows and vice versa. Neutral characters have specific winning conditions.

Evidently, this game advances fast. It only drags a bit because people needs to read the text present in all the cards. At the beginning it's free for all in attacks, until people start to die and reveal their characters. Then you have some information and you act with more smarts (not a lot, because its awfully difficult to know anything for certain in this game).

The characters are not balanced. It's more annoying that game breaking, but some are considerably more powerful than others. I would also add some more ways to guess people's identities (or at least get more clues), because 95% of the action is blind.

People really liked this game. I don't think the game is fun in itself, I think people makes it fun. You really want to choose well your fellow players.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] a better than average hidden roles games that has grown a bit old.

RATING: 4
First impression (7 players): Shadow Hunters is a bit werewolfish game. Good short games for 7+ players are always welcome. I liked the game but it felt that you might not have too much control over your play. In the beginning everyone is practically without any information and if you're unlucky you might stay that way for couple rounds (which is quite a big part of the game). Nevertheless the game is quite fun to play and over very quickly.

Update (28.9.2009): Played 8 player game that took more than an hour. It's way too long for this game, everyone should play faster. Seems that same things annoyed me as the last time. After the latest session I realized that I'm not too much into these "try to guess in which team everyone is"-games.

Very good, fun game in the style of "Ca$h & Gun$", but with its own interesting twists. Part deduction game, part horror, part adventure, and all mayhem. This is gamer crack: quick, fun, addictive, and you always want to play again to get that next high.

RATING: 7
Kutschfahrt das Brettspiel, but lacking in the development department. 

Z-Man sold this at 20 EUR in Essen, which was a real bargain considering the online prices. I decided not to buy because the games in progress on the demo tables looked so unbelievably ugly. This turned out to be a wise call, since the gameplay does not really meet the German standards I'm used to.

The game is very quick, and quite fun, but has balance issues. For all characters other than A and D, a valid winning strategy seems to be to just go postal and kill everyone else. Last man standing wins. This pretty much sucks the fun out of the deduction part, and can result in immediate player elimination.

Pessiomo gioco, in balia dei dadi dove la componente strategica è pressoché nulla; la fase di bluff e finzione dura giusto un turno. L'ambientazioni vampiri/lupi mannari non + proprio nelle mie corde, ma vedere i nomi delle creature (Emanuela, Walter, Diego, Sergio) mi fa accaponare la pelle. Scatola dalle dimensioni eccessive per un mazzo di carte e un tabellone quasi inutile. Bocciato!

RATING: 1
I had great expectation for that game after I read comments from players who tried the Japanese version. I though I would find it an alternative to Wanted, which I had enjoyed for a long time but got +/- fed up. I can not tell how high was my disappointment after 4 games : there is no need to guess who is your partner, because a simple reasoning and statistic calculations show that it is better to strike anybody than to strike nobody. So this results in a chaotic massacre and almost no decision-making. As usual in this case I read the rules more than three times hoping I did not catch something, and I searched the web for errata, with no result.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Just... what? Why? I will say it would be better with a higher player count than we experienced it with, but I just don't get the decision points in this game, or why I should bother with the nonsense over something like the Resistance. 

Played with 8. Still terrible. Even worse actually. Worst of the current crop of hidden role games.

RATING: 8
It reminds me of Bang! but with the roles which here are REALLY secret roles, at least for a large part of the game.
The game is fast and furious, with a very simple mechanics which, however, works. Graphics on the German edition is very nice and I like the werewolf-vampire-human setting.
It's problem is that there is almost no strategy and you can get killed without deserving it. But another game will start in 10 minutes...

RATING: 6
I'm not a big fan of guessing games, with hidden identity or role, because they do require the right group of people to be fully enjoyed.

That being said, Shadow Hunters possibly has some balance issues with some of the characters, who feel a bit too powerful, and also adds some randomness with the movement, that can be quite annoying. Still, it can be quite fun, unless players start attacking randomly, instead than trying to discern the identity of the others.

Personally, I find the overall graphic of the game to be bad, with the exception of the different character portraits. But the game board is really ugly. If I had to chose,

Use mean equipment and attack each other - ok! Hidden agendas - ok! Deduction - ok! Unfair unbalances - ok!

...sounds like a typical "Take this!" okay game? It is. Except for the Japanese cartoon art. 

Now, seriously: With 7 or 8 players, this game is slightly too long. I can imagine how fast it plays with just 4 or 5, but for a larger group, Castle of the Devil is the cooler alternative: No player elimination, more deduction, but the same start up problem with arbitrary attacking and defending. Far from excellent.

This is my favourite hidden identity game that isn't part of the Coup / Resistance universe. The rules are just so tight and not open to interpretation. It lost 1-point for the strange wording on some of the Hermit cards. The artwork is a bit dated, but the game is almost a decade old.

This replaced Bang! The Dice Game in my collection. It's about 50% longer, but 250% more fun.

A good party game for a bigger group, 8-players! It is requested often! If you do not have enough people to play a good gripping game of werewolf, this game fits the bill. However, the game play can be a bit dull! If you are a pretty interesting character...the game can be fun! Also, knowing when to reveal or not reveal yourself can be integral to winning! Everyone appears engaged in gameplay, but there is a bit of boredom that can encompass the game experience as well!

One of the most popular games at one of the gaming groups I attended (One friend proclaimed it to be "The Princess Bride for Games; Everyone's Always Up For a Game"). There are many elements here that make it friendly for new gamers: fast turns, easy-to-understand rules, and a hidden role element that keeps people guessing until the very end. It is just different and unique enough to still be fun after I've played it twenty times. Always fun to play.

Interesting game. I picked a copy up second hand. We have played a few times now.

It's a bit of Bang the Bullet, combined with Bacchus Banquet and Werewolf.

Good reviews in ny gaming group - they wanted to play it again that night and again the next week.

It's 'OK' but it plays quickly so will provide us a good filler when a 6-8 player game finishes a little early.

The best I've played so far in the "determine who's in your secret alliance and wipe out the others" genre, and I much prefer it over Kutschfahrt and Bang. Turns are fast and fun. Roll to determine which of the 6 locations you go to. The location determines if you pick up an attack card, a defence card or get to play a secret question card on any other player to help narrow down which of the three alliances they're on. Then take a free whack at anyone on or next to your location (damage being difference between 2 dice), particularly if through careful observation of previous secret question responses and subsequent whacks you've developed an idea of who's on what side. The white and black cards mix things up nicely, with swings in fortune as advantages wax and wane. A 5 player game is pretty fast, say 20 minutes with little downtime. An 8 player game can take double that, with obviously more downtime, but you're always kind of interested in what's happening. It's not a game loaded with strategic appeal, and the genre doesn't hold a lot of inherent replay, but it's certainly a contender for ongoing table time as an opener or closer.

Bumped this up a bit. It's the sort of game players need to play more than once to get it. Once you know the different characters, you know what the players might be aiming for with certain actions. Better knowledge of the games components make it much more interesting. Great stuff and hope to be able to play improved games as players get better playing it.

Love the design and the mechanic is really cool as well. It has been compared a lot to Werewolfs in terms of mechanics, but I think it's more akin to Devil's Castle. Since it is also much more action packed with fights and cool equipment and action cards, also the different character abilities are nice and make for some very cool surprises.

Great start of what promises to be an excellent addition to one of my fave type of games.

A very simple mechanic where you roll a die to move and then perform an action. The thing that makes it interesting is that your character is secret and each character has an objective. You may also be teamed up with someone else. So you need to first determine who is who and then make your move (or hope for the best). I was surprised that I like it as I do not like Bang!, which it is often compared to.

This game takes about 5 minutes to teach, yet the game play is fantastic.  There is limitless replay value as you try to figure out friend from foe from someone who will just stab whoever is weakest.  For new players, I would recommend being as aggressive as possible.  In every game there are more opponents then there are friends, so attacking someone at random is usually a good thing.

My rating on this game does not necessarily reflect how often I might play it. I think that the fun of this game is exploring it and interacting with the players. My rating reflects the fact that I don't think it is actually that great of a game because, as other people have commented, it seems to break down into bashing each other when possible.

What's funny, though, is that I still really want to try it again because it feels like there might be something really good hidden beneath the surface.

This game was described to me as "Bang done right", and I couldn't agree more.  Players have hidden roles (and therefore hidden teams) that can be discovered through various means during the game.  Your role determines your victory conditions.  Players generally become more injured as time goes on, so the game progresses nicely, instead of getting mired down endlessly.  I wasn't a big fan of the player elimination, but aside from that this was pretty fun.

original impression (2012 jan):
I would say that neutral characters turn this one into a chaotic mess of a game, where everyone will attack everyone and the game just does not engage you really. Also, the game basically plays itself - going to a location is determined by a dice roll and all cards taken must be used right away and often don´t give you much choice.

edit (2017 jan):
Replay with fewer players (6 instead of 8 players), good setup + expansion and good group, this game left me much better impression. Rating 5 -> 7

edit (2017 may): play with 8 players and only base game was also very good experience. I think it depends on the group and also I think I prefer fixed setup where the amount of roles in each faction is known.

Pretty neat game.  I'd definitely play it in the future but it is one of those games I do not feel the need to own.  The four player minimum kills some of the appeal for me as the majority of my gaming that I do is still me and my wife, so a game that cannot play at all with four drops a bit.  Not saying it is in any way bad, just not fantastic.  Good game and  I would probably almost always sit down to play if if invited, but could also pass it up sometimes and definitely don't need it in my collection.  The group I learned and played with was most of the fun I think.

I enjoy the secret roles and the how the "neutral" players can win by completing their own special victory condition. However, in the one play that I had (6 players), one of the players was eliminated after taking a single turn. Player elimination in a 45 minute long game is undesirable enough as-is... player elimination 7 or 8 minutes into a 45 minute long game is enough to keep me away from this for the foreseeable future.

Demons and Hunters try to kill each other without giving away their identities. Humans caught in the middle try to do other sneaky things. Fast, fun, and really unique. Has been compared to a fast, simple BSTBG.

This can clearly only have been invented by a Japanese with all those strange twists :-)

See this more as a partygame and you can have a good time as it doesn't take too long to play, but definitely don't take this game too serious as it is chaos from the start until the beginning.

Mafia Meets Werewolves of Millers Hollow meets Bang! Throw in some dice rolling and a board and what do you get? This gem of a game. High replay value, Interesting twists every game. Color of the pieces throw people off because of how similar they are and the amount of cards is lacking. Otherwise Excellent.

While I will still play Resistance, I like Shadowhunters even better. Same hidden roles trying to figure out who is who but if you are like me and not good at hiding that you are spy this game gives you a chance to stick around and interact.

I also prefer it over Bang, the Dice Game because while you can't attack just anyone you are also not limited by who you sit next to, not able to shoot any of the outlaws unless you use the Gatling Gun.

This is a fantastic game provided you have at least five people (and preferably you have more).  I have played this at four and I'm not a huge fan of it at that number.

Seeing someone's teammate basically kill them because they're attacking blindly and then you reveal that you're a hunter and you have the Spear and you kill their friend is a great moment.

Probably my groups favorite game to end the night. Totally replaced the game "Bang!" for me. The hidden roles work really well, and you really have to spend time figuring out who your teammates are. Plus it plays fast enough that we'll often just deal out two sets of roles and play it twice. The only down side is that it's a little harder to teach new players, since each neutral role is totally unique - and if they don't understand them all before you deal them out then they won't be able to ask questions without giving themselves away.

Variable powers, hidden roles, a deduction element. Being able to add to your powers though additional objects is a nice addition.

There are generally 2 teams which all win if side wins. The neutrals have solo victory conditions, and appear to be present to throw of the deduction element.

Plays better with more players (think 6 is a minimum).

If you have 5-7 people that are new-ish, this game is a no-brainer. It's easy to set up, explain, and play. Eventually the gameplay will get stale, but it's a good way to spend an hour or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite an intriguing premise (although the artwork is horrible) but I feel that most of the game is just too random and there are not a lot of decisions to be made. The dice rolling dictates where you have to go most of the time and depending on what you get (or don't), you can try to find out who is on your side (or not). Once that is done, the rest is just dice rolling and hoping for the best. The theme is okay, but like so many Japanese/Asian-flavoured fantasy games, just a butchered copy of Western mythology paired with cutie pies. There are much better traitor games out there, and much better games in general.

Another interesting take on the Werewolf deduction mechanic. I like the variable powers and the ability to attack other players. Where is slightly lets itself down is that it is more about attacking others than deducing what character they are. Even if you are a Hunter who needs to kill all the Shadows, it doesn't really matter if you end up killing another Hunter instead. 

Overall, The Resistance is a far better alternative - a lot more fun, more to deduce, and quicker.

This was the game of choice at my office for a long time. We made some tweaks to suit our play style. Specifically, (1) if Allie is alive at the end, she alone wins (exception: if Daniel dies first, he wins instead of Allie) and (2) we never played with Bob - substituted with Bryan (from the expansion).

The Allie rule was because she was very boring to play as. With the new rule, shadows and hunters both want to figure out who Allie is before meeting their win conditions and Allie is motivated to try to kill players quickly.

Wow.

This game is much better than it looks.

Role deduction is at its finest here. I played my first game yesterday. It wasn't a hit the first time.

Then I played another game at my dorm with 4 people. A roommate came in. We played again. And again. Then we got our boardgame-hating roommate to play. Needless to say, it was 2:30 AM when we called it quits. A very good game once you have 5 or more.

EDIT: The problem I have with this game is that that there are far too many errors within the writing. If they could rerelease this it would be much better.

In the family of Kutschfahrt and Bang, you must deduce the other members of your alliance while keeping your identity hidden. It has the best mechanics for leaking information out of any game in this family (except for Battlestar Galactica) and plays easily and quickly which allows it to take 8 players. The downside is that clever deduction won't necessarily save you from a quick death. This is perhaps the ultimate distillation of this concept. Good if you like this sort of thing!

Really fun social deduction game.  My kids prefer Avalon, but I prefer this.  The deduction portion of the game is minimized (compared to Avalon), but it adds the game play portion (moving, collecting equipment, attacking others, etc...).

Also, you can self-reveal who you are in order to take advantage of your special power (which is different for each character).

normal deduction (at least it's not social deduction), usually becomes all-out brawl because literally nobody knows who's on who's team early on

Shadow team vs. Hunter team, Neutral characters have separate winning conditions

would play only if there's nothing else to play and there's way too many people for other game (i.e. would always play this over One night werewolf or Coup or Avalon)

RATING: 5
This is a short, light knockabout game where the only fun is in the early stages - before you learn who's on your side or not - and then in bashing enemies with objects (via dice rolls) once you know who they are.

Tactics are very minimal and the element of this game where you try to work out which players are your allies is weak. It tends to just be revealed by random card draws rather than through deduction.

It plays quickly and it's quite funny picking up random objects and using them with maximum violence, provided you enjoy such basic pleasures.

I'm tempted to rate this a '4' but I'll stick with 5, as it's much more streamlined that some other games I've rated the same.

Interesting and simple hidden-identity game, which I've only played a handful of times. It seems pretty random, but fun nonetheless. In theory it seems like there are important deduction elements to work out the hidden roles of the other players, but this information seems to come infrequently enough that you may well forget what you already know, plus you might have randomly died first. Still interesting, but really nothing special.

This is a nice game, where everyone has a winning condition but they don't know the win condition for anyone else or who might be on their own team. As the game goes on, players have ways to figure things out about other players - how someone reacts when they see other players respond is equally important to figuring out who is who.

It's not an especially tricky game, but some players just don't get how to put clues together - which can make for a frustrating game. But with a decent group of players, this can make for a very interesting game!

I do quite like it.

After nearly 20 plays we realized we played the rules wrong and that attacks can only be made in your area (we always played any card directly adjacent to you on either side.)

This is in the Lifeboat, Bang, Werewolf "family" of games, with a touch of Munchkin and Bacchus' Banquet. You have hidden roles randomly assigned and you are trying to achieve hidden objectives to win while also trying to figure out who the other players are. This game feels more structured than the others, though. It also plays quicker and gives players a greater sense of control. 

With 8 players, downtime becomes a bit of an issue, but only during the hermit phase of the game (not technically a "phase" but for the first several turns hermit cards are mostly what people are going after). It's not a huge issue, but for what should be a light, quick playing game, waiting for two people to secretly and carefully read through a card every turn does make the game drag a bit.

Overall, I consider the game to be a little on the dull side and find I don't really enjoy playing it. After a handful of plays, I traded it away as it's not something I'll ever suggest playing myself, and find myself hesitant to join in when it is suggested by others.

RATING: 8
Very fun team/deduction/traitor type game.  Definitely needs 7 or 8 players to fully enjoy it, and it seems like most of the neutral characters have a really hard time winning. It can be a little slow between turns unless there is a lot of table talk with people trying to give advice.  I don't really care for the artwork/graphic design (same complaint I have for Fairy Tale). I really like how both the hunters and shadows are even.  Unlike other traitor games like Resistance and Saboteur where it's all about the bad guys trying to avoid giving any clues about their identity, in Shadow Hunters every one wants to hide their identity initially, but sometimes it's worthwhile to reveal your identity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
On cursory playthroughs, Shadow Hunters reveals itself to be both an addictive and fun "hidden identity" card game. The game works much like Mafia or Werwolves in that you can't really be sure who is and isn't on your team at the beginning, but over natural game progression people discover one another and form teams. The game was really fun on initial plays, and it was interesting to go through all of the characters to see how different scenarios work out between everyone, but in general I've found Shadow Hunters to become less and less rewarding with every gameplay. Some of this is due to the fact that for most of the game you are pretty much shooting in the dark, which becomes more frustrating than fun after a while. Another aspect I don't like is the win conditions, which can often raise the person who died first to become a team winner despite sitting out most of the game (this happens a lot when the game boils down to pure Shadows vs. Hunters). I give the game credit, however, for being able to support so many people and creating a fun environment among everyone - whenever my group of friends get together to play board games but we find we have too many people, we usually just resort to this game. Still, it's by no means great and I've simply become tired of it.

I would not go so far as to say that "I would cut my own throat before I would" ever play this game again. But I might certainly saw on it a bit with a box cutter. And if I did nick the old carotid when doing so, I might at least die with the consolation that I would never again suffer through a session of Shadow Hunters.

Pretty much the opposite of many things I like in a game. Shadow Hunters features player elimination, team-play, deducing hidden identities, horror theme, rolling for hit points...

Ok game. Plays a bit long for what it is I feel. Perhaps it was the group think of the individuals I was with but everyone was mining the card deck to determine the factions of the other players before committing to attacks.

As a result the beginning of the game is a bit of a slow burn. Things pick up a bit when some information becomes available though but the varying win conditions of the Neutral faction seems a bit unfair to the other two factions.

Another criticism is that early player elimination could have that person sitting out the game for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

Like Mafia but with a board game wrapped around it, and then disallowing/eliminating the center of Mafia, which is lying about your roles, sharing information, and trying to read other players at the table. I think it suffers more than it gains from the changes, honestly.

Plus it turns out that it is positive EV to attack without any information, and you randomly lose without doing anything wrong a pretty high proportion of the time. Watching my wife get frustrated playing this has dropped it another notch in my estimation.

Mercifully it's short - shorter for some players than others. I'm not a fan of elimination games and although you're not out of this one for long it's just a random and annoying waste of good playing time.

There's not enough opportunities to deduce who the other characters are if you're on one of the grouped sides. The independent characters can just bash anyone, but why would you give yourself away by doing so? The characters special winning conditions create a real luckfest devoid of intelligent play beyond the most basic principles. eg. if you can teleport and you're declared then teleport to the card pair with the most character cards on it - hope that this is the white defensive cards. It's all basic bashing stuff that sees you through about five or six turns before it's mercifully over.

I'd rather play Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg if in the mood for a deduction game - personally I find that small card game a lot more satisfying and fun when we've got six or more players. Shadow Hunters has merit as a closer if the players have a few plays under their belts, but I don't see myself getting that far. Not my cup of tea - I can see how others may quite enjoy it.

[b]Edit (12/2016):[/b] I still think this game is solid, but more recent games like [b]Coup[/b], [b]Resistance[/b], [b]Bang: The Dice Game[/b], and other hidden-role games see more play than this one. I will probably keep it around a little longer, but I'm not sure how much longer...

[b]Edit (08/2017):[/b] I gave this one another go to see if my opinion would change - it simply just lacks the pace and dynamics of other (newer) hidden role games. It was good in its day, but it has been replaced.

Player elimination is horrible in this game, I've been a victim, and seen others be victims, of random die rolling kills early in the game so that the eliminated sit out for the next 20 minutes waiting for a different game to hit the table.

Shadow Hunters  -- 

Scott Nicholson writes "When I play Kutschfahrt, I feel that about 2/3rds of the way through the game, you are just doing the same thing. Everyone knows who is on what side, and it's pretty much the same challenge again and again and again. You have to wait for someone to use a special item or ability to change it. So, the first part is interesting, then it gets slow, then it ends. It's more subtle.

"Shadow Hunters has the opposite pacing - it starts slow, then gets more exciting as it goes on and people start beating on each other more and more. It's more bloody.

"To use a BGG analogy, Shadow Hunters is Ameritrashy, while Kutschfahrt is Eurogamey. Choose appropriately."

RATING: 6.5
I am horribly hopeless in free-form role deduction games like Werewolf – I am a terrible liar and an even worse lie-detector, so having to rely purely on my instincts for an entire game is suicidal. Thankfully, Shadow Hunters lends some direction to the intrigue by including Neutral characters with unique winning conditions, as well as Hermit cards to whittle down possibilities. I appreciate these additions as they throw a lifeline to the clueless, while setting some creative restrictions on role deduction.

The tradeoff for the added structure is that luck plays a big role and players have to wait for their turns to arrive. Imbalance can also occur depending on the roles present. These hint that the gameplay could use a little more polishing, but the one real downside is that the graphic design and wording of text makes understanding card effects unnecessarily difficult. Despite not being a huge fan of this genre, I think this is one of the better entries out there.

Part Bang, part Werewolf. Players are dealt a 'role' card. Like Bang, the Shadow players win by eliminating the Hunters. Vice versa for the hunters. Neutral players have their own objectives.

Players roll two dice (D6 and D4) to move to locations on the board. There are cards to pick up (weapons, defensive cards) as well as cards to help determine identities of players.

Not a bad game but I'd rather play Bang.

I treat this as a random party game to play with some people, but it definitely is not for everyone.  

Issues we have found is that some of the characters just did not appeal to anyone.  Others are so much obviously worse than others that you are playing from behind from the start.

The biggest complaint though is with the neutral characters.  It is a fun idea, but too many of them have win conditions involving choosing a side or being forced on a side.  With 5 players or other numbers, whichever side the neutral lands on has a huge advantage.  Some of the better games I have had are with 4 people where there are no neutrals.  Although this really hurts the hidden roles aspect, since it becomes obvious really fast which side everyone is on.

RATING: 6
Good game but sometimes I feel like it has good ideas that is not utilized fully and too much randomness that is unnecessary. It starts out promising, you don't know who your allies are, and in case of neutral, how to approach the secret objective without giving it away. Midway...you find out who everyone is (which probably half of them almost dead now always because attacking randomly is encouraged). Then it becomes just 10 minutes of die roll at the end. Maybe I am trying to find too much in a light game, or maybe disappointed that the deduction element isnt more fleshed out

At its core, this game is quite random and you have little control over what you can do, other than occasionally getting to choose where you go (when rolling a 7), what card to take (in the area that allows a choice) and whom to attack.  However, the game plays fast and trying to deduce your opponents elevates this game to at least be good for some occasional fun.

Shadow Hunters does a lot of things I like: hidden identities, team-versus-team, asymmetry of abilities and winning conditions. It's just that many of these things have been done by the likes of Inkognito, The Resistance, and Cosmic Encounter. Here, there's too much randomness and not a lot of negotiation to make up for it. Mind you, I still enjoy it. After all, it does a lot of things I like. It's practically tailored to my preferences. But I know that the randomness would bug me a lot more if it weren't so short. In that respect, it feels underdeveloped.

I will start by saying that I have the set that includes the expansion in the core box (which is the standard release now).

This game is super fun honestly, I enjoyed it so much that I made a custom version based on the Fate/ anime and game franchise. I have yet to meet anyone who has played this and did not enjoy it

I will agree with the community here and say that this game is much better with more players but is completely playable at 4

My only gripe is so small it doesn't even effect the score, The explanation of "once per game" effects is not clearly defined as some characters can use their powers more than once. The rulebook does not address this at all and is only something that you come to notice by looking at a all the characters.

Shadow Hunter is a rudimentary hidden role game. The game play feels very restricted and basic, ie. ask a player a question, heal, damage. There are a lot of better hidden role play game out there, ie. Dead of Winter.

RATING: 5
After the first few minutes I thought Shadow was a dog of a game.  As we played further, I had a better time with it.  Next time I will stay away from the green cards, at least at first, as some of the other cards are quite powerful. It seems like there's more luck than control, maybe much more, but it might still be fun enough where it would improve for me.  I'd like to try it again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Okay, so first of all, I bought this game by mistake thinking it was Shadowrift but after I realized what it was I looked up some information about it, found good reviews, and a comparison to Bang!  My group likes Bang! a lot and I had fallen a little out of favor with it so maybe this would be a good way to give them the Bang! experience while freshening it up for me.  So I decided to keep it.

The games are certainly very similar.  Everyone gets a hidden role, the Hunters are trying to kill the Shadow and vice versa and there are also Neutral characters who have unique win conditions.  You move around a board which represents the characters you are within range of attacking, draw cards that can have single special effects, equipment with lasting effects, or play cards that give you the opportunity to learn something about the other players.

There are things I prefer about Bang! and things I like more in Shadow Hunters.  Overall I think the sum of parts is better in Shadow Hunters but it's not a huge improvement because of the few aspects I don't prefer.

The two things I think Shadow Hunters improves upon most when compared to Bang! are two of Bang!'s biggest weaknesses.  First, the characters you are within range of attacking every turn changes based on a dice roll so no longer can the Sheriff be demolished early due to being randomly sat between 2 outlaws.  I was afraid at first that this would introduce the issue of not being able to shoot the person you are after without a lucky roll but that's not really an issue.  There are six area locations and you can always shoot at a player on 2 of them.  Not only that but the law of averages would dictate your opponents and you should frequently wind up on the same space and rolling a 7 means you can travel to any location you wish.  Not to mention card, equipment, and character effects that let you manipulate these rules.

Second, the game plays at a much faster clip than Bang!  No longer can players play as many cards as they're able.  On your turn you move and then have the option to use the space you're on and attack a person within range.  Then your turn is over.  The decisions are mostly easy which might be bad for those of us looking for deeper games but good if you just want to play a quick filler.

What do I not like about this game compared to Bang!  First of all, the green Hermit cards allow you to learn with certainty information about other players.  No amount of bluffing and smart game play can hide you if your opponents know what faction character you are.  You also can't use your special character ability (one of the most interesting parts of the game) without revealing yourself.  This is probably a car vs. truck argument but I think hidden role games are more interesting when a player can't necessarily learn with certainty who you are (the exception to this being Battlestar Galactica but in that game the ability to look at a player's loyalty card is rare as opposed to a main game mechanic and there is also so much more going on besides).

The other main thing I don't care for is some of the Neutral character win conditions. Some of them allow the character to piggy-back on other factions' win such as "stay alive until the end of the game".  This, to me, seems a little less meaningful.  When your team wins by eliminating your opposition not knowing through some of the game who's who then it is interesting and feels meaningful.  Just staying alive, for example, and watching the game unfold and getting to "win too" doesn't seem as interesting to me.  Others are just so much easier and against the spirit of the hidden role mechanic, such as "eliminate the player to your left".  You know exactly who you need to kill and you don't care what faction he is, this is so much less interesting.

My friend recommended to me years ago and I found it so amazing at the time. Killed off BANG for me cos Shadow Hunters actually has a mechanic for you to identify other characters... And doesn't come with the hours of gameplay of Battlestar Galactica...

A slight problem with this game is player eliminatation. But I dont find this that big of a deal since you can still win even if you are dead (as long as your team wins)

Pretty fun game. Lots of laughs out of this one and play time is a lot quicker than what's written on the box. Probably never going to play Mafia/Werewolf again with this one around.

Its flaws become readily apparent when playing at the lower player counts because when one person finds his or her teammate, it's very easy, almost trivial, to determine whose team everyone is on, and at that point you're hoping to RNG your way to victory. Basically, it ceases to be a game. That's why this should only be played at 6 or more players, but even then the late game can get pretty boring.

I'm a huge fan of hidden faction games but very few of them do it well with less then 8 people. This one is superb though. Does great with 5 to 8 and even though it's a player elimination game, by the time someone is taken out, the game is usually close to ending. Lots of different roles to mix in so it has a great replay value. But the best replay really comes from the factions. There are two opposite factions and a neutral faction caught in the mix. The win condition for the neutral players are all different so you never can tell who's side they are on.

So far, this game has been teasing me, since I've only been able to play it with 4 players.  I can sense the great amount of fun that is to be had in this simple and quick-playing game, but it really needs a minimum of 5 players to be at all interesting.  And yet this isn't too bad, considering "Shadow Hunters" is often described as the board game version of "Werewolf", which clearly needs about twice that number of players to begin to get interesting.  This game also suffers from ugly artwork (according to my very subjective tastes), and, according to at least one very experienced player of this game, it requires some tweaks to be balanced (which tweaks can fortunately be found in the "variants" forums).  But most importantly, this game seems to succeed marvelously at being a quick and dirty "experience" game, where you're never quite sure who to trust (unless you're playing with fewer than 5 players...).  [Edit: Yes, it's much better with 5!!]  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 7.5/10

I was a lot less impressed with this than I hoped to be.  The core mechanic of rolling dice to see which card you draw is not very interesting.  Social deduction games with a larger player count usually benefit from simultaneous action, usually in the form of negotiation.  Shadow Hunters is spending a long time to get to your turn to very possibly do nothing.  Deducing other players' roles is not all that satisfying, and there really isn't much capacity for clever plays.

It's innocuous enough, but I don't see why I'd play it over most social deduction games.  There just doesn't seem to be much to it.

RATING: 7
[Z-man Games 08 edition] {Horror; partnership, dice-rolling, utility cards, hidden-identity, variable-winning-goal, player-elimination; optimal 6-8p}   I bought Shadow Hunters because I like hidden-identiy and partnership games.  At first glance, it seems a nice hybrid of Bang! and Werewolves.  The artwork is quite nice, too.  So, I decided to buy it.

Shadow Hunter is a good party game.  It is fun.  There are lots of player interactions.  Players keep talking, pointing, negotiating and arguing ^_^  There are 3 groups of role and 2 of them, Hunter & Shadow, are teamed.  The Neutral roles are independent and they usually win on their own.  It is not very difficult to guess the identity of a player.  And, keeping hiding an identity is not always the best choice.

It is still quite tactical within the chaotic environment; esp. when choosing which place to visit, which card stack to draw, which player to hurt, which player to give the Hermit card, etc.  Playing wisely can give you more knowledge about the players and thus increase the win chance.  I am a bit concerned about the balance.  I am yet to see whether certain identities can win the game more easily.

The game component quality is average.  The cardstock is thick enough for repeatable plays.  The different color-back helps separation.  The dice are not heavy enough.  I like the player large boards.  Color choice is poor - the red and purple pawns are very hard to distinguish.

This is a game that takes the fun parts of Bang! and does them correctly.  The Hermit cards allow you to identify who is on your term before you accidentally shoot them to death, and the game only lasts a good 20-30 minutes.  Plus, there's a lot less of the "I shoot you!," "Ha, you missed!" trade-off.  The board is simple but thematically appropriate and attractive, and there's, of course, the sick joy that comes from attacking an enemy with a machine gun and a chainsaw and a cursed sword all at once.  This is a fun filler of a hidden-teams, kill-everyone sort of game, and I can definitely see it being broken out a decent amount for groups of 6+.

Apparently, its kind of like Bang!, but I haven't enjoyed any of my plays of Bang! while I did enjoy this. Go figure. It seems shorter, snappier, easier to explain, a bit more subtle, a bit more creative, but my memory of Bang! might be playing tricks. Adding randomness to the action & attack avoids dreary targeting I saw in Bang!

(Werewolf/Mafia hidden-allies genre) I really like how this Shadow Hunters has HP and items and whatnot, and I also like that it can scale very well between 5-9 players. However, with that many players, the downtime is very bad, as there is often nothing to do on other players' turns. Contrast this to better games like Devil's Castle, Battlestar Galactica, or Resistance, which have a constant high degree of player involvement. Traded away.

A wild and fun hidden roles game. The straightforward battle between two sides is really thrown for a loop by neutrals with their own agendas. Make no mistake; this is a game with lots of luck and little balance. Its just crazy fun. Makes for a very talkative, energetic and lively session.

Shadow Hunters is pure fun.  Very simple rules, huge amounts of interaction.  This game is a social experience every time I play it.  There's always tension as you try to find out who is who.  Lots of violence and back-stabbity goodness.

This is kind of fun as it is similar to: hidden role games: werewolfe or the Resistance. However it is NOT heavy at all; so it fills a nice niche: hidden roles, fun and fast.  It has a very good sense of time, it takes about 45 min. and doesnt vary much. On the other hand it's not deep so I am not interested in playing it again. SOmewhat luck dependent as you can gain some really powerful weapons cards that seem to imbalance the game. Rules are clean, ergnomics (such as ability to understand the situation by looking at the board, able to reach stuff) is excellent, it doenst overstay it's welcome etc Good for what it is, not very deep.

RATING: 7
A game of hidden role, where you have to deduce in which team each player is. 

Works great if people try to play it according to the spirit of the game, waiting to find out who is who before getting down to business, but can break down if everybody just start attacking each other at random.

Some neutral characters are annoying though. You have objectives like: "you win if you die" or "you win if team X win". It is the weakest part of the game. 

The game is much better with more players. 

It can also be frustrating if you never land on a space which allows you to draw a green card, (which allows you to deduce who is who) since it becomes difficult to know who are your partners and who you must attack.

But when it works, it is a great game, with lots of thrills.

RATING: 6.5
tl;dr: Wherewolf with more rules

I'm not a big fan of Wherewolf and similar games. I feel they're too group dependent. This game tries to overcome that by adding cards to bring more structure to the game. And it works quite well. And it's pretty enjoyable. But while I surely didn't dislike playing this game, it's not my favorite genre and will never be. Still, a solid design.

Hidden roles; roll dice to choose where to go and then pick either a weapon, some sort of defence, or gather information about the other players.

Then race to kill your opponents before they find and kill you.

There are a few cards that are massively overpowered, but in all, it's a decent game with some production issues.

Update: It's an interesting game, but the draw of the hermit cards can give one or two players way too much information too quickly which can imbalance things even further.

Rating down from 7.3 to 6.9.

I love werewolf.  Werewolf is my friend.  And this game is no werewolf.

Slightly interesting deduce who is on your team mechanic, coupled with random card draws and hit points really seemed to take it from a nice deduction to more about lucky rolls and hiding as long as possible.

Update: I have given this game another shot.  It's still not great, but it's not terrible either.  I would play it, but I wouldn't seek it out.

Bang is better.

After playing the game once we decided it would be a good addition to our collection.  Of the other "guess a role" games (Bang, Coach Ride to Devil's Castle, Saboteur) we immediately knew this one had them trumped.  Solid Mechanics and more variety make this one our choice of that genre.

Awful game. I misunderstood the English wording of a card, and gave erroneous information to one of my opponents. This ruined the game.

Ordas likes this type of games (secret identity + variable player powers) but because of the easy mistakes about the very important secure information ruining the whole game I don't realy like it. Of course I should play this once again to be able to judge it but there is not too much motivation for me to do so. :(

My other concern about the game is the heavy language dependence. My English should be not so bed but sometimes in the evening I easily misunderstand sentences containing words "however" and several "if"s in the same time.

RATING: 6
I've heard it described as "Werewolf: The boardgame", but it seems more like Bang. In Werewolf, it's all against a few and everyone has one hit point. There's a group vote for who is hung. In Bang!, there's two sides trying to defeat each other and a player caught in the middle, but it takes multiple hits to kill you. There's no discussion on who you want to attack, so one player can be wrong about who they think people are and then shoot at their team.

Shadow Hunters has two sides with multiple neutral characters caught in the middle. Everyone has hitpoints and can attack whoever they please. They can acquire and steal equipment cards and each player has a special ability that lets you break the rules a little. So it seems like a version of Bang! that's based a little more with a board for moving locations and figuring out who you can attack.

I like the atmosphere this game evokes, but even when players are able to garner some information about the other players they still don't have a lot of control to affect the outcome.

Played at Essen 2010 and enjoyed it (Kosmos edition). Unfortunately, it will only shine with more than four players, so it would not hit the table often. maybe we buy it anyway, just in case that we need a game for that many players. Plays like a mixture of Bang and Inkognito, i. e. it has chaotic fighting plus deduction.

I would say you need a minimum of 5 people to play this game. The more the better. I would also suggest getting the expansion as there is not much variation with out it. This game plays really quick is makes a good filler game.You will not get deep meaningful games out of shadow hunter. Taken as a quick short filler it's pretty good. It's more of a party game than anything.

Definitely an improvement over Bang and Bang the Dice Game. I still think I prefer Good Cop Bad Cop in this genre, because there is less randomness (no dice rolling) but still a decent amount of chaos because of the evidence cards. Shadow Hunters is a bit much with the roll and move dice rolls, plus the different decks of cards, plus rolling the dice again to attack. Some of the victory conditions also seem incredibly luck-dependent, especially the one that needs to get five equipment cards.

There's something about this game that sells itself. When I show up with a bag of games, every one of my nieces and nephews says, "Did you bring Shadow Hunters?!" For that, it scores high because it gets everybody excited. The more I play it, the more I'm surprised at the balance of the game. There's really only one card that I feel doesn't stand an equal chance at winning (Bob is very difficult to win with).

Attack without knowing a lick of knowledge about the other players.  I don't get it.  Always seems to end in a very anti-climatic fashion as well.  Plus, if you don't like player elimination, steer WAY clear.  This is the worst of them in my opinion.

A fairly good hidden role game and one I enjoy playing whenever I get the chance, but it's a bit too long and too random (with the dice and all) for me to suggest it myself every time.

Parted with it, because I was offered what sounds like a really good deal to me, and it wasn't getting played anyway - didn't seem to match my group's taste.

3 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.

RATING: 8
This was described to me as a board game version of werewolf, but it doesn't feel like that at all. The only werewolf element in the game is keeping your identity hidden and using clues to try to determine the identity of the other players. The game incorporates both individual and team victory conditions which keeps things interesting as you have people looking out for number 1 while still trying to ensure they don't ruin the chance for a team victory. Gameplay moves fast and it's pretty easy to learn. The theme is very thick with dark elements so I would not recommend this to gateway types.

This is the best short/medium length 7-8 player board game around. It's much more fun than Werewolf/Mafia/Resistance/Avalon. The heart of the game is the Neutral characters with their own individual, secret objectives. Most games of Shadow Hunters have at least one surprising twist or reveal. The action starts quickly and the tension builds at a good pace before the flurry of revealed characters and once-per-game abilities.

In my mind a better take on what Bang! does for certain. Shorter games overall and tons of fun. but DAMN We need to get Zev to print the expansion.

What a fun group game!!!  Very fast, simple to learn and play, has good elements of strategy/deduction, low downtime, great interaction.  A group of six played this game a good 15+ times in the last three days.  The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because we implemented some simple errata of our own to balance the roles - for example making Daniel only 8 hit points (it's amazing how much more relevant he becomes), making Emi/Unknown have 14 to offset their weak powers, and reducing the HP of other high-power characters.  With our errata we have found it to be quite balanced and incredibly fun.  Easily my favorite "party" type game and the only one that everyone jumps to play.

This is a great little game that is perfect for large groups of players.  No one has any idea who is trying to do what, and the real fun is trying to stay alive long enough to deduce who is trying to kill you.

Simplistic, but very easy to get into and a suprisingly immersive.

Need to play it more, but very impressed with my first couple of tries.  So far, this is the absolute top of this type of game for me.  (ie, Werewolf, etc.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game of hidden roles. There are three factions: Shadows, Hunters and Neutrals.

For Shadows and Hunters things are simpler: to win they must destroy to other side. The Neutrals have different agendas, and can achieve victory in a number of ways: from just staying alive to having 4 or 5 equipaments on display.

However, some of the Neutral roles are really hard - near impossible - to fulfill, and receiving one of them is almost a "you lose" situation. I wish there was always a way for a Neutral to win other than the normal one for the role - like being the one that kills the Hunter/Shadow with the highest HP or something more clever. But this isn't true, and takes away from the fun of the game as a whole, as I saw, several times, the players with the Neutrals having less than they should.

Still, is a good game, with easy decisions to be made and lots of interaction, from dumb one (you don't know who is who, but you still wants to hit someone) to the smart - but no brain burn. There is some memory aspect built into it - is important to remember who attacked who, and if this happened after a green card was given, and also remember the answer to the green cards you dealt, but isn't really hard to remember.

Shadow Hunters have less chaos than the one you will find in Mascarade or One Night Werewolf, since roles doesn't change.

Anyway, Shadow Hunters plays easy enough to be teach in a matter of minutes, and basically guarantees blind attacks, negotiation, lying, bluffing, threatening, backstabbing, or in other words: everything you want in a hidden role game!

Good fun!

I don't see a lot of game here. It's a form of mafia/werewolf with no need for discussion and no differentiation between teams. It's a deduction game where the rate of discovery and who gets to discover it is random, and the ability to kill other players, once you do know what you want to accomplish, is also random.

I would actually love for this game to work, as I find the deduction part of mafia more fun than the deception part. But the randomness needs to be greatly reduced.

I like the flow over that of Bang (more deduction) and the time over that of Battlestar Galactica (about a sixth of the time). It's not much of anything without neutrals, but their addition is very nice and adds a cool flavor. The game does still have a lot of randomness and revealing isn't as dangerous as it could be. I feel like there's a lot of unrealized potential in this.

There's almost no actual game here as far as I can tell. It's similar to Bang!, except that in Bang!, you have some information to orient your initial actions (the identity of the sheriff). Here, you have nothing. There are so few turns you probably will never have enough information to be useful. You might as well play randomly. As a matter of fact, I DID play almost randomly (due to my goal and equipment which required me to attack every turn), and I was one of the winning players. As a side note, the rules are very poor.

Good game for players who value fun and atmosphere more than balance and competitive play. The euro players in our group of seven got frustrated with the player elimination, random dice rolls, random card draws and unbalanced character abilities. But then they would not enjoy themselves with games like Werewolves and Bang either. For me, it is a fun game with the right players, even though it can run a little long with seven careful players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game in the same vein as Bang, but faster and slightly more unpredictable. Like Bang, this is a hidden role deduction game where everyone is trying to figure out which players are on the same team and which ones they need to slay to win the game. Guessing is primarily done by giving question cards to specific players in order to deduce their roles. However, neutral characters can sometimes muddle this distinction, leading to second guessing and mistaken identities. Overall, this game has a faster pace compared to bang but more chaotic since damage is determined by a die role which ranges from 1-5. Also, deducing player roles is tougher since if you don't land on the section which allows you to ask questions, it is tough to figure out which team you are on. In Bang, this issue is somewhat mitigated since the Sheriff role is not hidden. However, this game is more tense and flows faster and smoother even with more players.

the "Werewolf" mechanic driven by cards- much like "Bang". however in this one you roll dice every turn, which tell you which card you MUST draw and MUST play, as well as whom you're able to attack this turn.

The decision to make the artwork Manga was regrettable, but its a deduction game that works towards its denouement at pretty much the right speed each game so something definitely went right in play-testing. Plus you have a reasonable chance of winning even if you are killed early.

I love how quick to setup, teach, and play this game is, because of that it's always something I'm willing to play.   

It's far from perfect: I dislike the anime-ish art, components are all pretty poor quality, aside from the absurdly thick color boards.  There's not a whole lot of variety, you'll see everything after a few games.  I have trouble finding a Neutral character that is really dynamic in what it does to gameplay.

Hidden-roll, take-that games are probably one of my absolute favorite types of games, and there aren't many to come by.  This replaced Bang! for me, but I'm still waiting for the perfect one.

I love Shadow Hunters!  The game is a detective-like game where players do not know the identity of the others but are required to figure that out as the game persists.  The conditions for victory for each player is varied and it is great fun to see players trying to win the game in their own way as you try and use that to determine what character that means they are playing.

The special items are fun - the werewolf's special ability makes him brutal in close-combat so it's best to get a handgun and try and shoot him from afar.  Things like that make this game great.

I love the character Allie who's goal is to just not die.  The character can be on the winning team by either killing everyone or helping the Shadows or the Hunters kill the other group.  It's very cool to see Allie flipping "sides" to what best suits her needs.

RATING: 4
Traditional werewolf "improved" with dice and power-ups and investigation options. With fewer players the deduction part of the game is almost too easy and you easily know your team well before the end of the game, with more players the game is just chaotic crap. The power-ups and investigation mechanic makes this more of a board-game but int the end it's mostly an antigame. Also the game easily drags on for way too long and coupled with player elimination I don't really feel like playing this.

Well this game just didn't do it for me.  There's really not much thinking, it's just roll and act.  Each player is a character who is a hunter, shadow or neutral with a special ability.  Identities are kept secret but can be revealed to perform abilities.  Each players winning condition is defined by their character.  There are 3 decks of cards that represent aggressive actions/equipment (black), passive actions/equipemnt (white) and questions to help identify what each character is.  The white and black decks are very reminiscent of Munchkin, another game I'm not fond of.  You roll move to the card represnted by your roll and take the action it represents.  Then you attack.  Keep doing this until someone hits their winning condition. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Yet another hidden role game, this brings little to the genre that you can't find in [gameid=925] or [gameid=41114].  There's a bit more chrome, which may appeal to long-time players, but comes with a cost of accessibility and more rules explanation.  The game is a bit degenerate, as it's very difficult to extract any meaningful information, and it's usually worth it to just attack willy-nilly because you're very unlikely to hit your ally.  As a result, the game tends to end before anybody knows much of anything about anybody.  Characters are noticeably unbalanced as well, as some are much easier to win with than others, and there's no way for the players to adjust for this with hidden roles.  

Most damning, though, the cards and components are confusingly designed.  The cards aren't that complicated -- most are along the lines of "If you meet criteria x or y, take one damage or give a piece of equipment," but it's confusing enough that it takes reading the card several times, and I've seen otherwise savvy game players still mess it up.  The coloring on the cards are awkward as well.  How about an intuitive color scheme for "Shadow" "Hunters" and "Neutral" like, oh, I don't know... Black, white, and grey?  Instead, we get red, purplish, and yellow.  Two of those colors read as "shadow" to me.

Don't bother with this game unless your group loves all the other hidden role games and want something ever so slightly different.

Rated after two games, where most of the players were newbies. A nice theme, but a really simple game play and the theme doesn't really fit the game - or at least it could be changed to anything else quite easily.

A nice combination of Bang and Werewolf/Mafia/Resistance, where each player has a secret role and goal. Playing deductive cards each player learns something from other players and can attack them. You might end up attacking a player for the only reason that (s)he is there and you have no other targets and you are not sure, which side the other one is. So direct interaction, player elimination and so on, be warned. But the game is relatively short, so it should not be that much of an problem.

Unbalanced objectives mean this game is only good for a couple of plays in an evening before it becomes tedious. 

30/12/2015: Changed this to a 3 from a 1 as apparently the Geek excludes "hate" ratings as they unbalance things. However, I hate this for a reason: it's fucking shit. The ratings system needs to reflect just how much of a fucking turd this game is.

Solid deduction/bluffing game. The theme is really cool and dark. Plays up to 8 players really well. Fast moving and easy to learn and teach. A little more going on then other hidden agenda games but that is not a bad thing necessarily. What I don't like is once you play a few games, remembering special abilities of characters will cause reveals much quicker. Not much to the components but the art is fresh. Overall it's very fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a neat game, that deserves some of the comparisons to Werewolf/Mafia, though that doesn't really do it justice.  It also has a lot to do with games like Sleuth, since you're trying to deduce what roles players are based on cards you give them to ask them questions.  I can see this being a lot more interesting with the maximum number of players, but even with 5, it was still fun.

With 7, it gets a little more chaotic, but the game is still fun.  The start of the game can be a little random, but maybe that's just because we started beating up on people without having a clear idea of who was who in the game.  If players wait until they know who they're supposed to hit before hitting, it might be a more strategic (or at least tactical) game.

Interesting werewolfish (BOARD not card) game.But suffers from insane amount of luck! First round pick up first aid and cipple the player with only 8hit points or even with one attack and lucky roll hit someone full 5 points of damage and then on other rolls do no damage at all.

It is hard to find a game were there is just too much luck in my mind but this might be it. Also if not everyone are intersted in the game or are too careful first half of the game can be very D-U-L-L.

Still better than Bang and I want to play this more to know for sure do I like this or hate it.

I didn't really get into the theme.

RATING: 5
This is an older game and I wish I would have known about it back in its prime. It's basically a secret role game, where each turn players roll dice to determine who they can attack. From these attacks, everyone has to deduce which players are on the Hero team and which players are on the demon team, so they know whom to attack.

It's very clever, but I think most gamers these days prefer a lot more control. Games like Coup and The Resistance provide the same sort of deduction, but with little or no randomness. I have had someone at nearly every session of this complain that they couldn't just attack wherever they wanted. Personally, I like how the randomness slowly unveils the puzzle, but I seem to be in the minority on that, at least around these parts.

I suspect we weren't quite playing it in the spirit it was intended as far as bluffing and role-playing to mimick behaviours or force actions goes, but it didn't really allude to enough to make me want to try it again.

Doesn't play well with 4 or more than 6 players, fun with 5 and 6. You have to accept that it's on the lighter side, that it's a "take that" kind of game and that in the beginning you don't really know what you're doing. This might sound strange, but it really is fun.

You'll get a hidden identity as either a Shadow (bad guy), Hunter (good guy) or neutral (neutral) and you need to kill those on the other side (or a unique neutral goal).

Unlike many hidden identify games this one gives you tools to find hints about other players regardless of their actions so guessing isn't essential. Add that with unique powers for each character and weapon/armour cards this game makes a fun time

This game will probably get played fairly often because there are so few games that play 7 or 8 people in a reasonable length of time.  Realize however, that if one of your teammates doesn't "get" this game, or someone screws up and inadvertently screws up their response or action, it really hoses the game.

Yes!  We love this one.  Some deduction, some secret information, some attacking, some arguing, some yelling.  It is great. If you have players who are down with this theme, then the game is worth getting.  

EDIT:  Since our discovery of The Resistance, this game does not hit the table as often.  A lot of us feel The Resistance scratches a similar itch in a much better way.

Try to figure out who your teammates are before you kill them.  Towards the end can drag a bit if you can't attack the player you need to enough, but can also be tense as you start figuring out what side everyone is on.  There are 2 main sides, but also neutral characters that have their own goals they are secretly trying to accomplish.

A team werewolf/mafia with no moderator like game with real deduction. The green hermit cards make turn this game from guessing and checking type of game into a struggle of knowledge and revelation. The moments when you choose to reveal your role that changes the game ... or when you play as 'unknown' and can lie (when people do not know about that card) are something that is not in any other social deduction game that I know of.

When it's chaotic, it's too chaotic. When it's not, everyone knows what's going on and it is just a race to kill each other with "not even handfuls" of dice.

This game suffers for me because there is no real arc to the way the tension and story of the game builds. There are two game states and when the game is in one state the deduction element is negligible and when it's in the other the combat is negligible.

Beer and pretzels material.

I've only played this with 4 players so haven't had the full Shadow Hunters experience.  If you like deduction and don't mind player elimination or feeling ganged up on there is a lot to like here... but with the wrong crowd I could see this failing pretty hard.  For me its a pretty good filler... though based on my first play I'd probably rather play the Resistance for this kind of game.

Shadow Hunters is another game that is very dependent on the participants in terms of its enjoyment.  If you have people that just sit back and do nothing, it will be a very uninteresting experience.  This is all about trial and error.  Taking out players is a way of information gathering.  However, I definitely don't like the fact that someone can be eliminated even before taking his first turn.  I agree that the cards are much too random, and it could be problematic if not enough of the hermit deck is drawn, but chaos is exactly what make this a blast to play.  I much prefer this over Bang! and Ca$h & Gun$.

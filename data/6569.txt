RATING: 6.5
Very fast playing filler with themes that generally appeal, successfully hiding the utterly abstract nature of the beast. And not only did they make this simple abstract maths tile-placement game a lot more atmospheric than it should be, they also captured some genuinely intriguing decision making, and even better, they made it free.

With a full set of 4 players it is pot-luck who wins, but as a 3-player and even more as a 2-player one, strategy creeps back in, and placement decisions become a nice balance between strategy and complete ruthlessness. Committing your markers early usually means that they get frozen out of the remainder of the game on a poorly scoring location, and Lady Luck does help your victory chances significantly if your opponent draws a positive tile, rather than a negative one in the turn after you.

What makes this game better than the usual maths placement games is the interesting choice of rhomboids tiles that cover 2 empty board triangles when placed, and by assigning a function to the empty spaces that slowly emerge between the tiles. Only because of the influence these spaces have on the score of the markers that they touch does this suddenly become a game with genuine placement considerations that lift it beyond a mindless doing-the-obvious pastime.

It is a shame that the draw determines everything that happens in the game though, as getting a positive or negative tile at a crucial moment can make the difference between winning or losing, regardless of how well you played. On the whole it has more going for it, than against, and despite its simplicity it still entertains me enough to warm up with.

A pleasant way to fill 10 minutes or so, and for a freebie it is stunning value for money. Saying that, the game is entertaining enough to track down one of the two differently themed editions, and spare yourself an hour fighting with knives and glue.

Bonobo Beach version.

I like the artwork and the general look of the game. It plays very quickly but is quite a bit of evil fun. I played it wrong the firs time, pulling markers off not only when all surroundings were full, but also when there were only activated spaces left as well. (It's harder to get your markers back if you play correctly, and that's definitely a  good thing.) Also forgot that you had to keep playing markers if possible (when you run out of spaces to play tiles).

Long story short, when you play it with the right rules, it's a very good and unique filler. I'm keeping it.

RATING: 6
The best thing about this game is that it plays out quickly.

The beginning of the game is very opaque, with early plays being nearly random. After that every turn is simply placing a tile and trying not to give the other player some points (since they have the first chance to capitalize on your moves). The end game is simply placing your scoring pawns on whatever spot nets the most points.

There a few opportunities for creative play, but much of the game is either random (at the beginning) or obvious (later in the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very nice, easy to learn and fast filler. The luck has sometimes an important role, but that makes this tactical game rather fun, and allows surprises, which is more than bearable (in fact enjoyable) for a 15 minutes game.
Can make it a bit more tactic by allowing each user to have an extra &quot;rhomboid&quot; left.

First of all, the components of this game are absolutely horrendous.  They&#039;re color copies pasted on to foam board and cut out crudely with an exacto knife.  Because I made them ;-).  This is a fine little game available for free from the publisher&#039;s website and it&#039;s quite unique, what with the rhombus-shaped tiles and all.  It&#039;s sort of like Auf Heller und Pfennig but much quicker.  The major drawback (to me) is that you _must_ play with 4 players as with less the game lacks a lot of crucial interaction.  I really liked the way special spaces are activated throughout the game.  Thanks to the Goslars for making this available to us for free!

This one was sort of a wolf in sheep's clothing for me; I was expecting a simple, light filler, but in the couple of two-player games I played there was a good bit of aggressive play and screwage throughout.  It'll take a couple more playings to really get a feel for the strategy of this one, I think.  Contrary to Mikko, I have a feeling the nastiness will diminish with more players.  Time will tell.

This is probably not my final rating for the game, since I played a single 2 player game. Still, its the kind of game where, sometime, you don't want to take your turn. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be a good way to setup a strategy. I won our game by more 50 points and I did not see any clear mistake from my opponent... I'll try it again since it's very quick and simple and it seems like the kind of game I should enjoy.

RATING: 5
A fun filler game with much more brainburning power that it looks at the first glance. Right from the beginning you can place your tile anywhere on the board which in some cases can lead to analysis-paralysis. The rules are pretty straightforward and so is the scoring system.

A nice game - that's all there is.

RATING: 7
Great tile-laying game of hedging your bets on the best spots.  Obviously the luck of the draw factors in, but once you become familiar with the tile distribution (which is not so hard as it sounds), you can play the odds a bit more.  Having pawns left after all the tiles are drawn is often a bad thing, because the remaining open placements are usually worth negative points.  It plays fast enough to get in a couple games while waiting for a session to start or taking a pause between longer games.  

For theme, the [b]Bonobo Beach[/b] version is the better, more original choice.

After several two-player games, I'm not so fond of it with less than three: chance factors in much more heavily.  [b]Kingdoms[/b] is the better choice for two.

Homemade. Original mechanics, but I don't like the way each tile has only positive or only negative numbers. If you draw a negative one, you are forced to screw another player instead of bumping your score.

Update: you depend too much on what others play, and each play depends too much on the luck of the draw. Downgraded from 6 to 4. Traded away.

Speculative tile laying and space claiming. Tactical and opportunistic, occasionally collusive but quite random, especially in the endgame. A little less chaotic with two, obviously. The theme fits a little oddly in the beach version. Note that the forced placement at the end is an integral part of the game - watch the overall development and decide whether to offload pieces in spaces of modest value. Of course, if you're forced to fill a -20 space with your last token just because of the seating order and everyone else is sitting with excess tokens they don't have to place, it still sucks. Lowered one point for endgame arbitrariness.

RATING: 4
Neat rhombus pieces. The downside to this game is that it is very easy for someone to suffer a series of bad luck draws that tanks their score to the point where they can't recover. Of course, the game is short enough that if this happens you can just start over. May be better to add some kind of variant where a tile can be saved for strategic play on a later turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One can feel helpless at times, especially in 4-player matches, when there are more opportunities to get screwed in between turns, but of course this remains true for all players and makes it (to me) more like trying to get screwed less than the other players do, rather than score the most points. As it is a rather unique mechanic and a fast play, this game will be seeing lots of play.

UPDATE: Definitely a game for 2, There is only a choice of 2 options in a turn but lots of opportunities in those 2 choices. We had been playing wrong where we scored the tokens as soon as coat of arms/parks were activated, now that we know they remain until the end of the game there is the additional strategy of trying to "trap" all of your opponent's markers on the board. brilliant!

This is a quick fun game. I like the Bonobo beach theme better but I was able to get the Cronberg version for 10 Can$ at Le valet. I like the fact that it's VERY quick and quite tactical. The 3 special triangles are what made the game interesting: how can you trigger them to screw your opponent or to double your score. All in all: a nice filler that scale well.

RATING: 5
First impression (3 players): You either play a tile or place a meeple at intersection. You try to place them at intersections where there is a positive value. I liked how forming empty triangles gives more depth to the game. Unfortunately the game is very chaotic with just three players. You can try to be how clever you want and still be more on mercy of other players choices than yours. Because the game otherwise is more of a analytical one this feels very wrong. Probably best with two players but I'm not a big fan of this type of games with just two players.

Played Bonobo Beach.

I thought I'd like this, but it turned out not to be anything special. The scoring got in the way of the tile-laying, IMHO.

Quick, light tile-laying game.  I wasn't sure how to do well, as it seemed that any great move would require two actions, and so much was done to keep from setting up a juicy spot for someone else to play.  Unfortunately, this left some painful spots that people (essentially) randomly had to play on at the end, resulting in wild swings.  Still, light enough not to be a burden.

A free print 'n play game that deserves to get a try.  A mathematician's view of Carcassonne.  A cold and analytical game with a theme that fits great.

bel gioco le cui dinamiche e strategie cambiano radicalmente in base al numero di giocatori. La componente aleatoria c'è, ma con una buona gestione non risulta discriminante. Preferisco sinceramente la veste grafica"vacanziera", ma i suoi file sono più difficili da trovare in rete.
Poi il fatto che questo gioco sia gratuito, è meraviglioso!

Cronberg (home-made version from free downloadable PDF file) -- Played once; four-player.  I played to gain points, with the thought that scoring during play would return my tokens.  I assumed keeping some tokens for re-use would be a good thing. I hadn't anticipated the endgame.  Yikes!  Once the good spots were taken up, I was required to place my remaining tokens -- on worse and yet worse spots.  

I've read that Cronberg was inspired by Kingdoms.  I can see this, but it is markedly different.  If you like Kingdoms, then you've got to try Cronberg.  Cronberg is mathematical, and it is very quick.

2007: 8. From a price to value perspective, this game is amazing.  I built my own using the downloadable PDFs, making pawns out of Fimo.  Easy rules belay it's deeper tactical play once you get into it, and you can play a couple of games in very short succession.  Must have at least 3 players though to make it worthwhile.

2014: 6 is probably a more accurate number, not from it being a bad game but more in how often I bring it out to be played.

P:2-4

Nice quick game that works well and has a wonderfully intuitive aesthetic feel (gotta love those rhombs).  However, for an abstract game, there is too much luck involved in the tile draws for my taste.  Placing your pieces can cause agonizing decisions, but when you choose a tile there is usually an obvious place for it to go.  Perhaps if people had hands of tiles (three?) to choose from there would be a bit more meat to this game.

It's a quick and interesting area control game that uses rhombus pieces with positive and negative number values.  I played it with four players.  It probably also plays well with two or three players.  I think I need to practice this one to pick up the tactics.  The short time requirement and few rules make it a nice short game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very nice opener.  It plays quick, but isn't short of difficult decisions.  This really hits the lune between abstract players, tile laying fans and theme driven folk.  I have Bonobo Beach, and the art and theme are silly enough to capture people that would normally not be into abstracts, namely me.  I can never have enough games with toilets in 'em.

Lay a tile or claim a spot.  That is all you have to do on your turn, but every turn is compelling.  Another winner from Kronberger Spiele.

Quote from "RSHIPP" "Quick, light tile-laying game. I wasn't sure how to do well, as it seemed that any great move would require two actions, and so much was done to keep from setting up a juicy spot for someone else to play. Unfortunately, this left some painful spots that people (essentially) randomly had to play on at the end, resulting in wild swings." I agree with Randy's assessment of this game.  And I was the one that went from first to dead last(off the board!)place in 2 seconds, when I was the last to play and the only location to place was a very bad spot indeed.  Even so, a pleasant enough experience, but not one I long to repeat soon.

I played this right after playing Beowulf the Movie game (i.e., Kingdoms redone), and this felt really thin compared to that.  Boy, there's a lot of negative tiles in this game.  I didn't care for the feeling of it.

Abstracts and geometric games generally don't rate high with me, so it already had two strikes.  I didn't enjoy playing it at all, as I expected.  It's not necessarily a bad game, just not my thing.

While the game is fairly abstract, I still like the theme and the art (I have the Cronberg version). Game play game be quite vicious, which depending on your opponents can be good or bad. I like that it can be explained quickly and play time is short.

The game seems weak with only two players, but gets better with three and four.

Cronberg -- quick-playing tile game, enjoy playing multiple games, feels like an abstract but I like the theme, and can't beat the price -- FREE!  Very good game.  The 3 player version is by far the most interesting, but the 2 and 4 player versions are still fun.  Update:  I like this game so much I had to get it for less than US$10 at LeValet.com, so now I've got a "real" copy.  A great math game for students (addition of positive and negative numbers).

Played 2+ times.  A little bit unintuitive and hard to play well the first time.  The game has a strange story arc and you aren't really expecting the negative point spots the first game.  You need to try and trap your guys on the board. I prefer the beach theme.  2006/12/08

Quick. Fun. And there are decisions to be made along the way. It's too easy to set up scores for yourself with two players. Best with 3, ok with 4. I prefer the Bonobo Beach theme to keep things light and fun, but the scoring track is hard to read.

I got hooked on the computer game. I think you can play a round in the computer version in under three minutes.

Fun, fast playing tile-laying game for 2-4 players. Lots of confrontation. Bonobo Beach has nice graphics and the game is very easy to learn. Lots of tough decisions. Playing your last tokens though is often costly, so it's good to get them out there when there are positive spaces left on the board.

I like tile games and this one is no different. I just didn't like the negative scores at the end of the game.

Now I take out the worst tiles in order to have more positive scorings.

Bonobo Beach; an easy, fast tile-laying game in the tradition of "Auf Heller und Pfennig" (Kingdoms) by Knizia and "Isis and Osiris" by Schacht, but with the addition of the interaction of triangles and rhombuses which delivers some nice tactical moments; the company released two games at the same time (Bonobo Beach and Cronberg) that have the exact same mechanics with different themes: Cronberg is about building a castle, while Bonobo Beach is about finding the best spots on a beach

RATING: 5
The tension that you get from placing a pawn before you know what's going to be played around it is good on the one hand (it IS a nice tension), but bad on the other (it's a bit chaotic).  I think playing the game with 2 would alleviate some of that chaos and allow for better planning.

Update: That you have to play a tile as you near the end of the game, and that you have to play your pawns, even when there are no good placements left, stinks.  I'd prefer an option where you may pass to end the game.

I like this game as a short filler.  It is easy to explain, and takes only 20 minutes or so to play.  There is a real decision each turn - play a tile or play a scoring marker.  There is never a perfect answer.

Wowzers, is this a brain melter!  It reminds me a lot of Kingdoms, in a good way.  Agonizing because you don't want to give your opponent a good move and yet, you don't want to place a pawn for fear of missing out on something better a bit down the road.  I like that kind of tension.

You have to make some interesting gambles in this game.  Playing it safe probably won't win you anything.  Unfortunately, playing the right tile at the wrong moment can give your opponents some great opportunities.  Fortunately, most of the time, you still have chances to undo the favor you've done.

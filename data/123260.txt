Instead of building resources to expand and grow, you are building resources just to keep your head above water. Yuck, it feels like a day at the office. Some of the game mechanics are clever but playing this game feels mentally exhausting to me.

RATING: 3
Suburbia falls into a series of categories that all reinforce each other and that Castles of Mad King Ludwig largely resolves (for me personally); I don't get a particularly strong theme from it because all of the tiles are sort of generic. It's an engine management game, and isn't particularly interactive. I was willing to play until the tablet edition came out, and now that I can bang out a game in 15 minutes or less against the AI (or in 30min with a pass and play against the spouse), I don't have any interest in the cardboard game. To compound matters, I'm not particularly interested in the app all that much anymore. I get the appeal, it's just not a game for me.

1-2-15: I download the iOS app and played it a few times. The scoring mechanic was a complete mystery to me until we actually sat down and played through the cardboard version, which we obtained at a math trade swap last year. HUGE difference!

Update 10-12-15: This is one of our 10x10 games this year, so I've had a chance to play it a lot. Sadly, this is one of the few games I can remember where the more I played it, the less I liked it. This game is too fiddly, the theme feels pasted on, and worst of all, it's very, very boring for me to play it. Buy a tile and place it here to go up on this track, but I go down on this track. Yawnnnn... I find myself preferring Castles of Mad King Ludwig over this game more and more.

Finally found a city-building game that I really enjoy. It feels thematic all the way through, and the interactions between tiles make sense. Everything pulls together to form a game that rewards good strategic and tactical play. With so many tiles available, it offers good re-playability. The association of tiles with those in other suburbs provides some form of interaction between players, and is pretty thematic too. I really feel like I'm building a suburb in this game -- brilliant design!

RATING: 6
After the ingenuity of the marketplaces in Glen More and Peloponnes (two very similar tile-laying games), Suburbia feels simplistic, derivative and a little bland. The theme is fairly well integrated, but a city-building game seems to me to require development over time of each individual tile (either enhancement, decay, or production abilities). The graphic design is poor and adds to making the game a very dry experience. However, with all that said, this sub-category of the tile-laying genre (whereby tiles are directly affected by those placed adjacent to them) tends to produce an enjoyable experience regardless, and Suburbia is no exception. It's simple to learn, with pretty deep strategies involved. Incorporating the fashionable-right-now variable winning conditions (Kingdom Builder) and secret objectives (Troyes, Archipelago) seems a little forced, but I guess it will prevent one over-riding strategy from winning every game. If this is your first foray into the genre, it's a fine game. If you've already played Glen More or Peloponnes, you don't really need to consider Suburbia.

It turned out to be all I suspected it would be: great theming, but very mathy and thinky in the way you resolve tiles. There are several angles to check - too many that can cause missing a payout. I do like the idea of gaining income and reputation to impact your progression, but the game is also unforgiving if you get in a revenue pit. You will fall behind in despair. All this adds up to me not enjoying the experience much and a desire to dismiss it from my collection. With no regrets.

RATING: 7
Combine the combos is the name of the game. I find buying and laying the tiles rather enjoyable. Every turn you are trying to create the best combos while gathering momentum for your income and victory point generation so that you do not run out of steam too early. Furthermore, the common and secret goals give you one more thing to ponder.

Some negatives can be found as well. My primary whine is about the tiles that give you bonuses for every tile of certain type in the game. It is just so hard to keep track of what everyone else has. Most of the time you also forget to take the benefit when other players add tiles into their boroughs. Ok, this introduces interaction into the game but at the cost of playability. Other issues I have with the art which is rather uninspiring. However, this is in the eye of the beholder.

The similarities with Castles of Mad King Ludwig are quite obvious. Personally, I prefer the Castle building due to its art and the more limited cascade of things triggered when you place the tiles.

After four plays, Suburbia debuted at #5 on my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/143773/admiralacfs-game-rankings]list of favorite games of all time[/url], but I've since dropped it a few spots.  I still really enjoy it and love the Sim City-like feel of it, but I'm a bit concerned about the balance.  The PR Firm is very strong, and the basic Park tiles seem like they're very powerful compared to the tiles available in the market.  The end-game bonuses also seem rather swingy.

That said, I still really like the game, but it has its flaws.

Great depth for its length. Public goals keep the game changing and make it tense and along with global tile interaction it keeps the game interactive.

Quickly ascending to become one of my favorite gateway Euros.  A nice tile-laying 'Sim City' type of game, where you build your own suburb to hopefully meet the requirements of one or more end-game goals (or you can completely ignore the end game goals and try to just get points in other ways--though I've never seen a player emerge victorious that way).  

While the game looks a little dry, it actually is quite interesting how the theme has been incorporated into many of the tiles (e.g., the hotel will give you benefits based on the residential tiles your neighbors have built, while the resort will give you benefits based on all of the residential tiles in the game--after all, why would someone go to a hotel in their own neighborhood?).

There is a fair amount of interaction between tiles played in your own suburb and tiles that other players place in their suburbs, so I purchased some of those nifty metal cubes out of the Geek Store so that people can mark tiles in their suburb that are affected by non-adjacent tiles in their own suburb or tiles in other suburbs to remind them to not forget the related benefits.  It can be a bit unruly otherwise to track all of the various movements until you've played a few times.

The only downside to this game I can think of is that I always feel like I've missed counting something because so many tiles you need to keep track of. Otherwise it's a very great game.

RATING: 10
Just a excellent game. Suburbia is a sim city/suburb game that involves drafting hexagonal tiles into your growing suburb. The tiles trigger powers when placed adjacent to other tiles and you want to build synergies that compliment your play and help you achieve hidden and public objectives. Of course, you also need to pay attention to other players and sometimes purchase tiles to block them. So the game is not just a multiplayer solitaire. the score track is also an interesting mechanic because you are penalized as you progress which you need to account for. This keeps you from growing unchecked and affords other players a chance to keep up. Suburbia contains a lot of interesting and I dare say relatively novel/uncommon mechanics that really help it both stand out and be a good game. It was designed by the same person who did castles of mad King Ludwig (very different game), and is a Mensa select. As far as I am concerned, suburbia adds credibility to the Mensa select award. Bravo bezier games.

Each player builds their own suburn in a city.
Player interaction higher because:
Buidings in one suburb affect those in others.
Players are going for common goals to get the most of things.  (Different goals selected each game)
So you must keep a eye on others' boards unlike many other games with separate player boards.

Pleasant tile city-building game.  Good little puzzles each turn.  A little repetitive.  Seems to go on just long enough.

Good production value, but the font for +1 and -1 has the + and - way too small...damn near need a magnifying glass to play!

A game I love, but struggle to get to the table. I thought my wife would really enjoy it but it never clicked with her for some reason. It's also a pity that it's not easier to pull off green strategies (the best path to victory tends to be to get your income up as high as possible and then build late, rather than a build mid all game) so can feel a bit railroady.

I like this a  bit more every time I play it.  For a game with separate 'player boards' there is a decent amount of player interaction beyond just denying other player tiles.  It plays fairly quickly and provides a decent amount of depth, and the variety of goals and tile mix ensures each game plays differently.  Another plus in it's favour is how it smoothly copes with all the varying effects that tiles have.

A really cool game that suffers from some pretty debilitating flaws.  Love the mechanics and implementation.  Works very well.  Why the not-love?  Some of the goals are awful as common goals.  Streakiness of buildings (how many of each are included) is horrendous.  And there's no easy fix because it's a core game mechanic.  If you get lucky and invest in x tile when all of the parts for its engine are in the game, good for you!  Otherwise you lose.  Oh well!  The lack of being able to predict what your engine should be is wrong.  Also, a couple tiles are too powerful, or can be too powerful in the wrong hands (i.e., my opponents').  I want to like this one (really!), but there's too much not-quite-right with it and my enjoyment is hindered.  Ah well!

RATING: 6
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I didn't dislike Suburbia, but I also didn't enjoy it as much as other people seem to do. There're some aspects of the game that bother me and made the experience not so fun. First is the real estate market mechanism. It happens a lot that I couldn't get what I needed just because of the way the tiles came out, because, when the turn came back to me, that tile was gone. Often also the second choice was gone and that left me with some suboptimal choice that I was forced to take. That is just too random for me and simply isn't fun. Even more than that is the end game situation. While I appreciate the unpredictable end game trigger, at the end of the game I feel like I didn't get where I wanted to go with my strategy. I'm just entering that area of enjoyment for what I built and achieved, that the game finishes. That deprives me of the sense of accomplishment that other games about building give me. Another minor complaint is the chaos that often comes from the tile activation. It happens easily to forget to apply some effect and that's annoying. Although this probability disappears with experience.

Overall Suburbia is an ok game, that failed to meet my expectations. For sure I understand why people like it so much, but some of its design choices just don't work for me.

I may have initially rated this higher than I should have. The game was.. meh. 

The main problem I had with it is that the tiles that are randomly removed can significantly change what strategy will work, but there's nothing you can do to plan for what's coming. The result is the blind choice you made on turn 5 determines whether you win or lose.

Suburbia is the closest thing to SimCity in a box I've played. The strategic depth to rules complexity ratio is pretty high, meaning it's quick to learn, but hard to master. I love that the only randomness in the game, what tiles enter the market, is mitigated by the high initial market price of those tiles. I like how tile placement and city planning are crucial to success, just as in real (sub)urban development. The small amount of player interaction is exactly right for this near-solitaire optimization game. The tile interaction follows real world NIMBY/YIMBY development principles. AP is limited by the tiles being face down until they enter the market and players can think in advance during other players' turns. I am always eager to play this with anyone who has the time.

My rating was an 8 before I played my second game, with the only thing stopping it from being a 9 was the rather bland visual style. I want you to think about that and realize how wildly inconsistent the experience of this game is going to be.

Suburbia wants to be an engine-builder but doesn't want to take responsibility for actually achieving the polish that those types of games require. In order to have a good engine-builder, you want a little bit of random chance to spice the game up. And Suburbia does this. Except that in this game (at least the 2P variant), you can easily get to a point where the +$10 slot is the only one anyone buys out of, if they built their money engines correctly, which we did. Unfortunately, this means the player who wins is the one who picks up PR Firm first since it's completely broken, stopping you from losing any rep for the rest of the game as you pass red tape. This is the single most game-changing effect, since red tape is supposed to slow your VP-gaining. Casino WISHES it was this good.

For some reason they appear to not have play-tested the possibility that players just ignore the trade row and only buy Heavy Factories, which has proven in our games to be a first-order-optimal strategy. Which of course means it happens every game, so you have all these dumb as fuck rounds early game where every player wants their factory tower. Which sucks because now you're blazing through red tape. I could see some groups never learning about this, but once you do, it kinda kills the whole game. Yellow tiles can do everything and rarely punish players (unlike Blue tiles which get punished hard).

Pure population in early game is suicide, since spamming through red tape just means other people with properly built engines will overtake you. This of course means early Green tiles tend to get ignored by everyone.

Early money ramp and gain is pretty much the only strategy left and is indeed the same flow the game takes every time: ramp money early so you can buy expensive broken tiles mid (Casino+PR Firm), then double anything that gives a fucktillion population right before the game ends. If you're spending doubling tokens before the last 3 rounds, you fucked up (or got sacked because this game is completely unbalanced).

With practically zero strategy left, now it's time to move on to tactics. Are there any? Well, sure once you get some money ramp going, you can start trying to make good formations and plan for end game scoring. Except not if you took a restaurant strategy and hardly any were randomly chosen to be in your game. Or airports. Or parking lots. Or schools. Jesus fuck, what is this game's goddamn problem? Why is EVERYTHING chosen at random? You pick 15 random A tiles, 15 random B tiles, 15 random C tiles, shuffle them each randomly, add the End Tile RANDOMLY into pile C, and then hope to absolute shit you don't get fucked.

Which leads me to the travesty that is the end tile. In what fucking instance of a strategy game is it okay to just suddenly and without any warning END THE GAME? None. Absolutely none. That isn't how skill works. That's how blind luck works. You have this nice tile-laying puzzle to solve with a cute drafting mechanic and all these interlocking piec--OH NOPE, WAIT, TIME TO STOP PLAYING. There could be 14 fucking tiles left to go but it's time to stop. This is an absolutely abhorrent tile and we had to leave it out just to have a small amount of fun.

On top of that, for a 2Player game, 15 tiles in each pile feels too short. Engine-builders should definitely end before they wear out their welcome but Suburbia has a huge problem where the exponential growth can happen well before it's even possible to end the game. So if you then also make the end random, it feels like you're just fucking players who could make a comeback (and have when the tile was removed). Actually, with 17 tiles in each stack, the 2P game felt the correct length. This just screams "not playtested" to me.

I could rant for eternity about the bad with this game. The good: component quality is nice, could be comfy if all the randomness calms the fuck down for like three minutes.

Overall, a great idea wrapped in a mess of bad mechanics.

I suppose the mechanics do tie in with the theme; but it doesn't prevent Suburbia from being a fairly dry, non-immersive game. The utter dreariness of the drab art doesn't help at all, either.

A remarkably fiddly game, and the tiny icons just add to the fiddlyfest. While Suburbia is not a luck-driven game, luck-of-the-draw DOES play a huge part with regards to the individual goals that a player can strive for: many of the goal targets cancel each other out, and players can be in a boring Mexican stand-off with one another.

I see clearly why there are speed-bumps in the VP track, since there is a most definite runaway leader problem in Suburbia...even with the speed bumps!

A very good redeeming quality about Suburbia, though, is how utterly different each game will be.

Euro-ish tile-laying game with several moving values to track and interactions with other players' tiles, so you have to pay attention to what other people are buying, even though there is little direct interaction. Fun if you don't mind minimaxing point games.

Fun tile laying game with set collection/synergy scoring.  The city planning theme works well with the tile laying/board building aspect.  The scoring is reasonable for a game of this type, and the challenge of managing the reputation/population levels is fun.

Very impressed by this tile laying city building game. The theme of building a suburb can hardly be less appealing to me... yet this game pulls it off. Indeed, its theme actually drives the mechanics very well in how various tiles impact your borough. 

There is some talk about the secret goals not being fair or thematic, but I found them tactically interesting and don't necessarily mind if they make 100% sense.

Pros
- Cool tile laying and city building aspect
- Fun interactions with different tiles
- Encourages forward thinking
- Thematically, where you place the tiles makes sense

Cons
- WAY too much bookkeeping. Easy to miss something small since there's a lot of symbols on the tiles
- Thematically, I don't see how scooting tiles over after each turn fits. The longer they're out, the cheaper they will become? 
- "Goals" in the game are very tricky and nonsensical.

The tableau builder thought it was doing a good job by asking you to also pay attention to the other players tableau's. And if it had a central tile that we were building off of, that had all of the relevant tile types for the city listed on it with dials, I think I could get into this more. But as it is, it is just a bit too brain burn.

So here we are again, building a city and finding that it is better to build parks than heavy industries next to residential neighbourhoods.  Suburbia gives each player their own city to develop rather than a shared space, then introduces a bunch of endgame bonuses and in-game calculations to make you pay attention to your neighbours.  Then there's a market in which you can pay a premium for that desirable tile, or wait in the hope that no opponent will buy it as its price reduces.  Another familiar element (from Age of Steam) is the reductions in income and reputation at various points of population growth.

So Suburbia throws together familiar elements in a fairly novel assemblage.  However, I found it only moderately engaging to play. Get sufficient income, grow population, pay close attention to the end game bonuses, that's all isn't it?

I found Suburbia graphically bland, though clear and functional.  The money board that isn't big enough for the pile of money appears the only misstep in a well put together game.  The rules are clear and seem complete.

This is an outstanding game that was killed for me a little by my fiance. She just became so enamored with it that she made me play until I naturally memorized all the decks.

As it stands I am just a little burned out on it.

The game offered less than I expected. It was interesting at first and the catch up mechanism does not allow a runaway leader to get completely away.

RATING: 7
This game plays in a nice mellow way such that the fun is in buying things and adding them onto your tableau to improve your engine.  It might be a good "go to" game if you wanted a nice mellow engine building game with tile laying.

I think the one thing perhaps lacking from this game is a sense of adrenaline or excitement, and curiously, I think that may be in part be attributable to the spartan art chosen.  Part of the excitement in any game involving a shopping component is the feeling of REALLY wanting something.  It helps a player experience that "want" more deeply if the object of your desire looks really great.  (For example, ani-meeples in Agricola do "work" better.)

Here, the art is, temperature-wise, almost sub-zero, faded and abstract. There is thus, less emotional desire for any item, and one is left essentially with wanting something purely based upon its intellectual "gaming effect."  Nothing absolutely wrong with that - such is the case in all abstracts - but it feels like a thematic and emotional opportunity was missed with the art in this game.

For first timers, of course, some tiles are fiddly with some huge questions of tile interpretation swinging the game. Then again, Castles of Burgundy had this same problem, and I readily forgave it.  You just have to play it enough times I guess.

There are so many things I like about this game. It flows really well, has very clever mechanics and there are many ways to score points. For some reasons I find it difficult to bring to the table.

I just love it.  I don't care if I win, and I try to sell people on a similar idea.  It's just damn fun to build your little borough and have everyone play off one another.

I'm very eager for them to add more to this gem.  It's not that there isn't variety in the base game, but that I look forward to what else they explore in the design space.  Adding more tiles in the process will be exciting for sure though!

Lots of hype and I don't think it really lives up to the expectation.

The game itself is pretty dry/boring and is really about trying to synergize various combos of buildings.  It has a Through the Ages style of purchasing tiles that make things more expensive if you want to purchase it in the future.

In the end it didn't feel super satisfying as it was just a matter of getting money/veeps by placing tiles.

Would play Glen More over this any day as it involves production of goods and resource management, a closed market for money, but retains the fun of tile placement/synergy.

The best thing about this game, in my opinion, are the goals. You draw which you personally try to achieve (draw 1,discard 1) and those that you're competing to achieve with your opponents (also randomly drawn). There is player interaction (you have to consider the affect of the tiles you draw on the other players) and the fact you can try to take or remove tiles that would be beneficial to your opponent. There's definitely some randomness. Another problem I have with the game is the goals (which is one of the best things about the game) it's almost too clear which tiles you should pick, because your goals should focus your strategy (although to some people, it may not seem clear). Lastly, the interaction between the hexagons you place in your city is pretty necessary in the game design, nonetheless, how you should place the tiles is very straightforward I think, kind of simplistic.

Suburbia is a great game. I love the process of trying to find the right tiles to buy to activate different abilities in your suburb. Finding those synergies is incredibly fun to me. The delicate balancing act that comes with increasing your income, your reputation, and the setbacks that come with increased population are a ton of fun. I love engine building games, and this is an engine building game that also incorporates finances and a theme that I enjoy. This is absolutely one of my favorite games.

Update: I really cooled on this one a lot over the years. I still enjoy it and think it is fun. However, as I've moved toward heavier games, I've become less satisfied with the simple buy a tile place a tile simple decision turns in this game. I'm still happy to play this, but I don't need to own it anymore.

Wound up getting both this and Castles of Mad King Ludwig, despite their similarity, and I gotta say I prefer this one.

The game lets you plan your engine in a satisfying way, while simultaneously letting you deny your opponents critical components of theirs (by turning them into lakes!)

Also, this was my first introduction to the newest-tiles-are-most-expensive mechanism, which I think improves every game that has it (e.g. Manhattan Project, Small World, and Eight Minute Empire: Legends come to mind.)  Great way to mitigate luck-of-the-draw.

Initial rating, based on playing once. My very first reaction upon seeing this game was instant love. I still think the theme and overall cohesion is awesome, but gameplay is too fiddly and unforgiving for my taste, with there being far too many points for mistakes. 

I particularly dislike the reality of tiles which have an effect based on any other tile of a certain type being played anywhere by any player. If you have multiple of these in your suburb, the game becomes a boring slog of paying far too much attention to far too many tiny details. Having "oh sorry, I forgot to adjust [this]" moments in a game is okay every so often, but from about the midgame, Suburbia has this nearly every turn. Preventing this means slow turns (re-read all your tiles again), which have to slow other players down too, because if they don't wait until you've looked at all your tiles, they'll make a move which could've had an effect on you without you noticing.

Newbie mistakes (not building up a money engine) are also punished too severely (no good way to recover).

RATING: 5
Normally city-building, engine-building, and auctions are mechanics that I love... but suburbia's implementation creates an average experience rather than something impressive/outstanding. Why? There is simply too much luck. Now normally, auction mechanics can eliminate the swingyness of a game while adding a decision. But towards the end of the game, certain tiles are a no-brainer and the auction track doesn't extend far enough. Combine that with an uncertain end-game, with a set-up that randomly adds/removes tiles from the game, and with hidden stretch goals that are VERY influential... the game feels less calculating and more of one where players are hoping that a tile does/doesn't come out. 

But it is very easy to learn, plays smoothly, and does allow for some creative decisions. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, it is a good/average game.

First outing: Surburbia felt like Through the Ages light without the direct and negative player interaction, which in no bad thing.  Goal tiles apart, the rules were easy to follow.  The graphics were functional and clear, except for the confusing use of a similar blue for both the civic and the lake tiles.  The game felt quite polished and well developed as I’d expect from both Ted and Lookout.

However we had one big and unnecessary issue regarding the goal tiles.  Was this game blind play tested?  A whole page is devoted to reproducing the goal tiles full size.  The images should have been much smaller and coupled with an explanatory narrative which was badly needed.  For example, in our three player game the Miscreant tile was drawn as a public tile.  It was a close game.  We each thought we had won.  The whole game hinged on the definition of this tile.  Player ‘H’ read it (incorrectly we agreed after post match analysis) that the winner on the tile was the player with the lowest reputation.  Player ‘W’ read it as being the player with the most (biggest negative) ‘immediate impact’ to reputation icons, player ‘B’ read it at the player with the least (lowest negative) ‘conditional impact’ icons.  We eventually resolved the game and the winner using a definition of most (biggest negative) conditional impact icons including the effect on the adjacent tiles.  So, a three plus hour game came down to a rules discussion, which with an explanation in the rules, would have been rendered unnecessary.  Not very satisfactory.

On the plus side, we all enjoyed the game.  What I would recommend is, that for all of the public goals at least, the players agree what they mean before starting to play.  I have ignored this issue in deciding my rating as it is a game that I expect explore further and to get my money’s worth from.  Qualified congratulations to T&T.

Suburbia is a shining example of a game that works but isn't very fun.  All the pieces seem to fit, the theme is nicely integrated and there is a good sense of your city coming to life in front of you.

My problem with the game is that it all just sort of marches along without much tension.  Decisions either feels obvious or uninteresting.  While it is satisfying to see your city build up with it's own little internal logic, game play feels isolated and dull.

-----------------------------------------------------
original comment:
Still not quite sure what to think of Suburbia.  Part of me feels like it produces a great simCity experience where individual locations synergize or interfere with whatever ends up next to them.

I'm not sure the game is incredibly interesting (despite being very playable).  Sort of like a light beer.  I still need to play with the expansion though.

Jóféle lapkalerakós játék, sokkal-sokkal jobb, mint pl. Singapore, City Tycoon. Nincs feleslegesen agyonbonyolítva (5 perc a szabály). Pörgős, eléggé letisztult, bár a szomszédon túli lapkákat kicsit macera lett volna figyelni, ha nem házilagos segédjelölőkkel játszottuk volna. A vége felé elég AP veszélyes lehet, de mivel jó és még jobb lapkák közül lehet választani, engem gyakran az se zavart, ha esetleg csak jó jutott:) Most nézem, még egyedül is lehet játszani! Kifejezetten ajánlom.

I like building a community and imagining the silly juxtapositions, like a radioactive waste site right next to a national park, an elementary school surrounded by heavy factories, and so on. Interesting income/population growth mechanisms too, where raising the population means lowering income and reputation as your suburb loses its small town charm and pays more for municipal services.

An excellent economic/development game with abilities, that plays fast, has very small explanation time, has depth and balance and for once it features a very good use of the spatial tile placement element which I usually hate.

This game would be ranked higher if I didn't have CoMKL. A great balancing act buying what you need versus watching the price of tiles you know your opponent wants.  There are even a few aspects of an economic engine as points accumulate.  Drawbacks include a lot of accounting/tracking that is easy to mess up.(This accounting is dealt with in a much cleaner way in CoMKL).

Suburbia is a very enjoyable and thematic tile-laying game, in which each player builds his own neighborhood/tableau.

The gameplay is very straightforward: each turn you buy a tile and add it to your tableau (triggering various effects) or "invest" in one of your tiles doubling its effects (up to three times per game).

Reading the rules I feared it would be fiddly to track down the various effect, but everything flows quite smoothly.

Gameplay is not very interactive (you build your own tableau), but some tiles affect other player's neighborhoods, so everyone is involved even on others' turns.

First Impression: This is a euro simcity game with a strong inclination for point optimization. This game's tile laying mechanisms are similar to Ora and Labora in that the neighboring tiles impact the decision as to where to place a tile. Conflict is indirect. Hidden objectives and random tiles in each game keep the game fresh.

Had this game on my wishlist for some time and finally received it as a Christmas gift in 2014.

After 12 months I've played it 14 times and still like to play it regularly.
The game offers a nice mix of strategical and tactical decisions. Some buildings act as triggers with adjacent tiles, your borough or even your opponents' boroughs. This creates some nice interaction between players and adds (dis-)incentive to build certain buildings.

You get more tiles than you use per game thus the game offers good replay-value. Further more the tiles have different relative value depending on the number of players (e.g. buildings with triggered beneficial effects are certainly more valuable the more player there are to trigger them).

It's a pretty good game with 2p. It's already at the top of my range for bookkeeping with 2, I do not think it would be fun with more. The main issue I have is, sometimes a tile comes out that you just can't let the other player(s) get. So you pause from building your city to stop them. Then you're behind the 8 ball... Not a keeper for me.

It's definitely in the same family as Castles of Mad King Ludwig. It's less fiddly, which is nice. The scoring is more predictable to a novice, too. I'm not sure yet whether that will be an advantage or disadvantage with a significant number of plays.

A very well designed game. The theme comes through with the way the tiles relate to each other. I appreciate all the thought that has gone into the tiles, as they really make sense with their game effects. I think I prefer it with two players, as it allows you to plan ahead. The math is intimidating, but seems to feel natural after you get used to it. Having secret scoring goals is a favorite of mine in board games. It's very rewarding to see what you have built at the end of the game.

A game that I decided not to buy at Essen 2012 and after first play I think that was the right decision for me. This is a bit of a dry affair where it helps to know what the secret objectives might be and then to guess what other people are going for. The 20 points for least reputation seems contradictory because you will probably miss out on more than 20 points by aiming to keep your reputation score low enough to scoop this reward.

There appear to be some obvious strategies but there doesn't really seem to be any appreciable depth to this one. When played by people who know the rules and the set up a play should be very quick, fast enough to maybe be considered a filler.

Suburbia is amazing. In much the same way Flashpoint creates a realistic fire-fighting atmosphere, Suburbia gives the impression that players are actually building bustling cities. Very few games balance a reward-penalty decision-making process as well, from deciding how much to pay for a tile, to where to place it on your grid. There are very few perfect choices, making each turn an incredibly deep and thought-provoking experience. Can't recommend this game enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoy Suburbia quite a bit. It is about as streamlined as a city-builder can be. Each turn, you can buy a tile and add it to your city. The tile will give an immediate bonus (increase income or Reputation) and then it might give a bonus to other tiles around it, and then tiles around the tile might give bonuses. Sounds complicated, but it really isn't. I like how the game makes you go for a balanced strategy by making you lower your income and Reputation tracks many times during the game as you get VP's. Goals add a public as well as a secret thing to shoot for to give extra points at games end. A solid game that should stay in my collection for many years.

I used to love SimCity, and often I've thought about tracking down a good city-building board game to scratch that same itch. Well this is the closest I've seen so far. The mechanisms are simple, but with the number of things you have to think about it might not fly with non-gamers. The progression of the building prices seems logical, but perhaps a little too steep. I ran into the same problem with this game that I deal with in all engine-building games. I focus too much on the final goal and forget to build a good foundation, so I end up desperate for cash by the end. It is nice that there is always something you can do, though to grab cash by placing a lake. The goals will probably be the hot-button issue with this game. I liked them because even a player like myself, who was scrounging for cash most of the game, can still compete for the win if you accomplish the majority of the goals. Others will dislike this because they will feel it doesn't necessarily reward the player who built the best city. Most of the mechanisms make thematic sense, which I like, but I'm still not sold because it would probably stymie my parents.

RATING: 6.5
Something about this game just doesn't sit well with me. Maybe it's the way of figuring scores (income, population, reputation) every time you place a tile in your suburb by having to look around at your opponents tiles since buildings interact with each other. Or maybe it's the scripted path with the strategies involved in upping your two tracks. The game just felt a little too fiddly for me.

 Despite the aforementioned, I rate it a 7 for innovation and design. If asked to play I will, if only for the reason of trying to figure out what the hype is all about and if I missed something.

Buy tiles from a market and place them in your city then calculate the effect of that tile- very simple mechanics but some complexity in what tiles do and in strategy.

Kind of hated my first play but has grown on me a little in subsequent plays. There are lots of "retroactive" effects in this game, e.g. a tile that gives you +2 when you build on a lake also gives you +2 for everything you've already constructed on a lake. This can be frustrating at first as an error in counting up your incomes is often very, very tricky to reverse.

First game was fun, came second in a 3p game and enjoyed it even though I was a little lost at times. Seems to have some depth and once you figure out a more optimal build path for your tiles it's an enjoyable game. Seems to be a number of ways to win through economy and reputation which is nice - not shoehorned into a single strategy.

Recommended.

It's fun, but scoring can be difficult because you have to keep up with what everyone else has too.  That's very hard in a four player game.  I like Castles of Mad King Ludwig more.

Hex tile based city building game. Quite sim city esque and with bonuses compounding as you build certain tiles into your city (and sometimes if other players do so too). Also some additional bonus goals, both open and hidden to make games more interesting. Best of Essen 212 for me so far.

After a handful of plays, I'm still REALLY enjoying this one - it's the city-building game I've been waiting for. Lots of different options, plenty of player interaction, lots of interesting interactions between the tiles, and some secret objectives to keep things interesting in the end-game. Love it.

It's a lovely laid back, but still strong euro game. Building your suburb is rewarding and finding good combos and the right tile at the right time is a nice puzzle. There is some interaction and even blocking possible, so it won't become boring I suppose.

Suburbia’s gameplay is a bit mundane but the theme provides fluidity as the tiles interact with each other in ways that makes sense. When your infrastructure grows, so must your population etc. The game rewards you for building intelligently but slows you down when you get ahead of yourself.

Suburbia is a very good game.  Everyone says so.  But it's not to my tastes.  I like a couple aspects of it, but ultimately I find it an unexciting exercise. It doesn't help that the art style reinforces the banality of play.  Again, a very good game.  For others.

Manages to be pretty simple and still fairly deep and thematic which is quite a feat.  The city building theme is cool and is integrated well the game plays pretty quickly.  The goals can make the game a little weird, depending on what comes up.  At the end of one game we had everyone trying to get rid or their money (spendthrift), create lakes (aquatic engineer), and lose reputation (miscreant).  I like this kind of chaos but having the game hinge on these kinds of things is a little strange, at least thematically.  Also, it's a little like a mathy optimization problem with several things to track and lots of cube moving.  It would be nice to have a computer manage all the this stuff- a similar feeling as I got from Sid Meier's Civ the board game (FFG).  Yeah the Civ game and the Sim City games seem like they'd work better on a computer- funny huh?  Anyway, this is quicker and more streamlined than FFG Civ and the book keeping, while fiddly (push cubes, the cube crossed a line, push other cubes, etc) is manageable.  Another negative is that the components are ugly, they definitely chose function over form, which is good, but maybe a little more aesthetics would have been nice.  In the end, I didn't think it really lived up to the hype, though I would play it again, I found it a little too puzzle-y and fiddly.

Played this last night for the first time.  Not a bad City building game.  It's quick to teach and fairly quick to play (I think our 4-player with 3 noobs took a little over an hour).  There's probably a bit of depth to it, but it didn't jump out at me.  I'll happily play it again and it's possible I'd get it as a medium-light next-step up from gateway game.  However, nothing particularly innovative here.  I still wish City Tycoon had better components.  The game itself was much stronger than Suburbia; however, Suburbia is definitely more approachable and has MUCH better bits.

This is a really great city-builder. I like the many choices you have and trying to figure out not only how to build your city but how to keep your reputation and income stable every time your city grows. The mechanics all work together quite smoothly. I like the concept of hidden goals mixed with goals every one is competing for. All-in-all I'm pretty impressed with Suburbia!

RATING: 6
We played the game for the first time last night.

For the first half of the game I really enjoyed the whole thing... well themed, fairy good pacing. Love the feeling of building a town, and the rules are simple. Great! I had developed a relatively solid lead in both money and points to the start of the C round.

But then...

The "PR firms" came out early on and one player obtained both of them. He quickly pegged 15 points/turn and won by a landslide. I obtained an early "casino" tile which gave me effectively limitless money for the rest of the game and came 2nd.

I'm sorry, but the "PR firm" (particularly) and the "casino" tiles are ridiculously overpowered. They completely ruin the game if they come out early and are not burned. They remove the whole "resource management" aspect of the game (which, er, is the whole game).

Pretty much, if any player (a) has money saved up heading into the C stack and (b) is lucky enough to flip the tile on their turn, they win the game.

It alone soured the entire experience of the game for our group -- including the winner.

I'm not sure what on earth the designers were thinking.

Wow! I don't think I've ever seen a game whose theme is so fully integrated into its mechanics as Suburbia. The balance between building reputation and income vs. facing the pros and cons of an ever-increasing population is nearly perfect. 

During our first game there were some moments where we actually stopped playing and paused to talk about the cleverness of the game's design. The moment I was forced to place my housing projects in a corner of my board behind the factories and garbage dumps, I knew that this was an amazingly thematic and brilliantly thought-out game. By the end, we all had something resembling real suburbs, with residential neighborhoods, office parks, and warehouse districts, all of which were shaped by the mechanics of the game. On a design level, one of the best games I've played.

It is fun putting your borough together and edging out other players for choice tiles.  I found it a little difficult to remember to score the "all" tiles -- they should have a different border or something to make it easier to remember to check them each turn.  Also the rules for the investment markers aren't nearly as clear as they should be.  Regardless, it is an enjoyable game.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice tile-drafting game with a ressources management and engine-building aspect to it, with a really appealing "Sim City" theme, that is well implemented into most of the tiles abilities.
++ There are really a lot of strategies explore in this game as there is a lot of possibilities and combinaisons to score points (you can focus on different type of building according to the public objectives and your private objective).
++ I like that you have to manage the spacial element of the tiles in your borough to respect some criteria (proximity from other type of tiles to combo with them) which for the most part feel thematic, and also that you have to check your opponent's borough for other bonuses on other tiles.
++ I really like the more streamlined mechanisms of this versus the newer Castles of Mad King Ludwig (CoMKL), because it give a better flow here: Analyse your tableau and your opponent one, choose a tiles, place it, and score it (the tile, any adjacency and any other bonuses/penalties).
++ Compared to CoMKL, I like that the setup is faster in this one.
++ Compared to CoMKL, I like that the scoring is more straightforward and thus faster in this one.
++ (App version only) The solo campaign is fun and challenging and force us to play differently to achieve the different city's goals.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- (Physical version only) I would still find this game a bit too fiddly and with a lot of upkeep, as we always have to calculate every points/income/reputation we do from the tile itself, then any adjacency with other tiles and then any other bonuses (or penalties) from any other tiles and this, also from your opponents tiles in some cases. The App obviously really help with that and the information is really well presented to quickly see the bonuses and penalties of every placement.

Good and short game.

Not very sexy artwork / theme, and with a lot of calculations made for accountants. Very very poor interaction, we don't know what others are doing.

I found the "anti win-win" effect red bars on the scoreboard not very elegant.

Apart from that, SUBURBIA is a simple, fast and good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Suburbia is an engine building game, which is pretty much my favorite type of game, so it's no surprise I liked it.

On your turn, you usually buy a tile and add it to your town.  Most tiles either increase your cities income (which you'll use to buy more tiles) or increase the rate at which people move to your city (which are your points).  Almost all the tiles interact with each other in some way, so you're always watching how your group your tiles, or watching what other players are doing since some tiles get bonuses for what others are doing.

You also have to build your city carefully, as the more people that move to your city, the harder the game makes it to keep your income and population increases flowing.  If you're not careful, you can eventual start losing people and money!

At the end of the game, your score is your population, plus whatever goals you win.  There are a few public goals, and each player has a private goal.  Goals are stuff like having the most grey buildings, having the highest income, or building the fewest lakes.  The goals actually score a fair number of points, so they're important to keep in mind when building!

Overall, a cool engine building game with a fair amount of interaction.  I look forward to playing more!

Tileplacing game which I enjoy a lot. Most of the tiles make thematic sense and while it looks like there isnt that much direct interaction between players, there are plenty of tiles that affect tiles of other players.

Great game of city building. Aim for the common goals in the centre of the board and your own personal goal while earning more and more population. Clever thing with this game is that when you earn too much population then you have to drop your every turn income down a little as the city has more people to cater for. Very Good Game. 13 Plays.

I really like how the goals each game push my urban planning in a particular direction. I enjoy trying to figure out how to best add to my town while keeping the goals in mind and what's been built to date.

However, too much of this game feels like the typical build my money engine then switch to my victory point engine later in the game game. 

Also, this game seems to be missing some kind of spark to really get it going. I think the mix of randomness of the tiles (both in timing and distribution), mixed with the very solo nature of personal boards, leads to me never really being excited to play this game.

Okay so the app is not really the greatest way to learn this. The game took much longer than it ought to just because certain things didn't really click for us until partway through the game.

I'm coming at this having played Castles of Mad King Ludwig first, and this is an enjoyable counterpart. There's definitely a LOT more calculation going on here - to be honest I found the amount of math in this game a little paralyzing (this is where the app version wins!). I could see this inducing some SERIOUS AP in people.

This game is a nice mix of tile laying and engine building, with a couple of interesting unique mechanics thrown in. I really like the way lakes work - it's nice to generally always have a move, but adding that extra layer of interaction where you can use them for tile denial (if you can afford it!) is a great little extra choice point. The investment mechanic might be my favorite part though - it's a great little decision, and getting to trash something from the market afterward is just icing on the cake.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game even though I think I personally prefer Ludwig. But I also think these two can happily coexist.

The theme works very well here and is well represented in all aspects of the game layout.  The problem is that the accounting is onerous and hindering.  You need to play this a few times to get better at the accounting, then the game play and strategy will come through.

This game bores me. I just don't feel like there's many tough or interesting decisions to be made during the game, just pick whatever is on the line that serves you well right now. The goals can somewhat differentiate strategies, but not significantly. I'm not interested in playing it further.

This game would probably work much better as a computer game as the upkeep is tedious as well as the constant calculations and checks to see if you’ve taken every tile into account. I’ve heard that they will make this game as an iPad app which is going to take just 10-15 minutes to play (which should be compared to stated 90 minutes here on BGG)…

In any case, Suburbia has a lot of good stuff going on. I’m a big fan of games that include a spatial element. The way you’re placing your tiles and thinking about how to increase their benefits is something I enjoy a lot. How to maximize the synergy between the tiles is basically the game. There are lots of different tiles so the variety in each game is huge. However, I also think this is a downside to the game; you’re never sure which tiles are in the game, so if you’re planning to go for e.g. airports or green buildings etc., you can get screwed if none (or perhaps just a few) shows up. This is quite critical I think. 

I like the various and different goals which you have access to at the beginning of the game and which help you shape your strategy. I’m also a sucker for secret goals, so that’s always nice and it’s often hard to figure out what goal a specific opponent has, which is as it should be so you cannot just copy their moves. I also like that you need to balance between your population and income, though income is vastly more important at the beginning of the game! It’s clever that it becomes more and more expensive as you get more and more points. 

Maybe it makes sense that certain tiles provide income or loses reputation etc. depending on which tiles you put them next to, and while I can appreciate this thematic touch it doesn’t mean anything special to me as I don’t really care about thematic flavor. The artwork on the tiles and the rest of the game is quite bland. 
Finally I will state that the game is very fiddly; you constantly need to check to see if your own tiles provide any income/reputation – and then check if your newly placed tile is affected by the tiles in your opponents’ boroughs. This leads me to think that a SimCity-kind-of-boardgame perhaps just doesn’t work as a boardgame. It’s a decent game that I would play again, but I don’t need to own it.

I like the Sim City-like theme. Some of the tiles appear to be overly powerful. The effects are in quite small writing so it's difficult to monitor other players suburbs and the effects they have. The combined effects when placing tiles can also become a bit fiddly.

A unique twist on a tile-placement game, as the location of each tile a direct impact on your score (as well as other players).  Although some might consider this a "multi-player" solitaire as you attempt to build up your suburb, there are enough tiles that are impacted by other tiles played by your opponents that you have to pay attention to everyone's actions.

Overall, one of the more unique tile placement games, and definitely something worth playing many times.

RATING: 8
I like Suburbia, and it is the finest example I've seen of the city building genre.  However, it has two enormous problems: (1) it is a terrible game for people prone to AP, and (2) it is an administrative nightmare, and more than any game I've ever played, it causes people to say, "Whoops! I forgot to get points from when I did _____."  

I like the game, and it is a ton of fun, but for my time, I prefer Castles of Mad King Ludwig, which I think did some of the mechanics better.

[b]Includes the Suburbia Inc expansion[/b]

One solo play so far just to get the hang of it.... the real test will be playing this as a two or three player game, but I like the promise of combining simple turns (pay for a tile, place it, next!) with some cool interactions. It seems like an interesting task to manage both income and reputation, as it's an uphill climb when every tick up the VP track dampens both of those.

Let's see how it goes multiplayer...

Update: So, now having played the game properly with three... I think I like it. The reaction I got from my group was a bit more tepid. They didn't like the random pull of tiles to start the game, not knowing what would show up. And, the sequence of figuring out the effect of the tile itself, then adjacent tiles, then other tiles, etc. struck one player as a bit fiddly.

There's something about it that I like though, and I'm wondering if this will really succeed as a two player game with my wife. I need to give this another shot.

RATING: 7
What a great city building game with so many interesting and thematic tiles and touches with the rules that really bring you into the game as you build your town. The amount of city tiles and goals will ensure each game is different and once you get the round sequence down it does go pretty quick. While there are a few things to remember regarding the order of actions, checking your own adjacent tiles, and checking everyone else's tiles it only takes a few rounds for everyone to get it straight. I don't think I would ever want to play this with 4, but 2 or 3 would keep the game at a length I enjoy. Hopefully this can come back out again soon.

Sim City the board game.  The game almost feels boring at first, lay a tile and gain a few bucks, repeat.  As the game gets going however you start to find wonderful combos and start to rack up wealth or points.  The real excitement is the last third of the game as everyone makes a desperate reach for points, trying to go as far as they can without slingshoting back down.  I've played this twice and both games ended up very close, with one player going for raw points and another going for bonus and secret objectives.  It lets both players think they've got it right up into the scoring phase when it's over.

UPDATE (11/15): Circled back to this one on the ol' iPad and I have to say that I am entertaining the possibility that this is a significantly better game than I originally gave it credit for. I still think that the iOS version may be a superior platform for the game, though.

Yo dogg, I heard you like Carcassonne and Race For the Galaxy so I put a Carcassonne in your Race For The Galaxy.

Tableau building game with a strong spatial element. Puzzly multi-player solitaire up to 11. Evokes its city-planning theme w/o simulating city planning -- don't go in expecting SimCity the board game if you want to not have it lose you straightaway. Rules are extremely tight and well-presented, but working out the various adjacency bonuses and penalties seems like a massive pain in the booty; fortunately the iPad version takes care of that for you, so that may actually be the preferred format in my eyes.

I always feel like I am missing something that I should be getting in this game (Not like Mr. Jack (see comments above) but like - "I think I should have gotten some points or money or something last turn". This is usually followed by, "Nope - you just suck at this game."

My only minor complaint is that the game looks fairly bland. All the peices look rather generic and blend into each other. Some pieces have full game benefits that I miss from turn to turn because everything sort of looks the same after a while. 

Maybe I should stop drinking beer when I play? That might help.

This one would be perfect for Ipod adaptation.

A lovely game that anyone can be taught how to play, but is pretty difficult to master and offers lots of different play styles to it. Rules are easy to understand, gameplay has a rather quick pace to it, and even going alone (or against a "dummy") offers a fun and quick challenge. I prefer playing without personal goals though: the game has enough random elements to it as it is without me knowing if player A or C is gonna collect 20 bonus "points"/citizens just like that when the game is supposed to be over.

Bought to play solo and after 1 round, it was decent fun.  I wouldn't say I was overwhelmed (yet) by the fun of it.  I followed the solo rules and got 81 points as my final score.  I'll try to fire it up again with the kids and see how they like it.  I don't think it is going to overtake Machi Koro with Harbor expansion as our fun "city" game, though.  Too soon to tell.

I played this again with my 11-year-old and she seemed to like it.  It was a nice change from the normal games we play.  While she hasn't requested playing it again, I think she liked it enough to jump in if I set it up and said "Ready, come play."

RATING: 9
Highly accessible both because of the universal appeal of the game's theme and because all the applicable mechanics are printed right there on the tiles, minimizing the need to go rooting about through the rule book. That said, run away screaming if you hate math, because there is a LOT of math required in this game. If you're cool with that, this is a virtual surefire winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game requires the player to exclusively concentrate on income early in the game to build a economic engine.  Maximising your population is emphasised in the end game since this is the core scoring element.  This means that what could be considered a good tile at the beginning and end of the game can be a small subset of the tiles available in the market.  This can make selecting a tile trivial if you can afford it and equally leave you with no good options on another ocassion.

Most of the games I have played so far have been two player (very enjoyable) but I was expecting this game to be better with three players this not my experience.  

If you do not get access to a significant share of income enhancing tiles through the market in early game you will simply be out of the running.  In the three player game the increased demand for appropriate and timely tiles in the market mean that someone will probably have a bad start and will have no chance to catch up (assuming equally skilled players).  The three player game is a little long to be flagging up a loss so early.

This good game that could have been a great game if there was a way to make lemonade whem the tile market is handing you lemons.  Equally a catch up mechanism may have flattened out the issue a little (I was thinking about power grid).

As a quick two player game this downside is less of an issue.

I am playing this on IOS at the moment and the downside is still there but less of an issue (its not going to put you out as much if a few of the games you are playing simultaneously is giving you no breaks).

Likes: Great implementation of the theme. Quick gameplay with little downtime and plentiful strategy. Easy to learn rules. I really like how your income and reputation goes down as your city grows.

Dislikes: The punch-out quality can be poor, especially if one is not super careful when punching, leaving small tears on the backs of the tiles, though it does not have as much of an effect on this game. Also, the goals feel like they give the game a big swing, so we have tried house-ruling them to be worth 5 less than stated.

This is, so far, my favorite game. I generally love the feeling of building something up, especially the way this game makes almost every action add to your city in one way or another. And everything you've built continues to mean something in turns to come, interfacing with anything you add. There's something about the red lines (and the tiles that deactivate them) that makes the game feel slightly imperfect, and once you get the expansions setup becomes a chore, but I love it all the same.

Many of the rule question on the forum is also due to people not grasping all the rules.

Tile laying: the game. The way diminishing returns are handled is excellently thought out and the various goals spice up each game.

Another game which is all "in the components" as opposed to "in the rules", which for me means simple rules, deep gameplay. Would love to try an expansion.

I really enjoyed my first play. YB, who had played before, played an excellent planned game and with the desert in round 2 was recognized early as the likely winner. I was happy to aim for second which I got handily. 137 points (30 from bonuses) YB 157. Michael and Jason close on about 115. 
The game does get pretty AP for me trying to figure out options even when there are only a few options that are likely to be successful.
There is a LOT to keep track of. Most of the time (multiplayer and solo), there have been things that were forgotten.
Solo play isn't as good as I had hoped. 185 twice.

This game is ok. You build your city using hexagonal tiles and try to have the most population at the end (balancing population growth with income the whole game).

Pleasantly surprised! Gameplay options on your turn are dirt simple. 90% of the time you simply choose a tile, pay for it, and place it. You get to build your own 'burb, and the key is that relative locations for many things matter. And it's mostly in a logical way. Bonus points for playing well [i]under[/i] the rated time. I have no idea how this could take 90 minutes. One would not be blamed for considering this multiplayer solitaire, but there's not enough incentive to pay attention to what others are doing to make it interactive. But it will never be confused for a highly interactive game. But that's fine, not all games need to be. There are way more tiles than you need for a single game, which means lots of replayability. It also means a fair bit of randomness because you don't know what will or won't come out. This handily stuffs and fires Urban Sprawl. As if it needed firing. The only knock against it is that as players' cities grow, it can be [i]very[/i] to overlook an adjustment that needs to be made, as many buildings start interacting with each other. So you have to really be paying attention, not just to what you should do, but what the bookkeeping required is for you what you [i]actually[/i] do.

Games with adjacency mechanisms continue to hold my interest, and so when I was in a position to play Suburbia, I was very glad to be able to do so: the game had succeeded in avoiding my attention for a while now. Unfortunately the initial acquiantance was not as pleasurable as I'd imagined. Now this can be attributed in part to me playing the game with just 2, where I gather that the performance isn't all that great. Matters become a truly bland min-maxing and just politely ignoring the other player: chances are far greater that any of the tiles on offer will benefit you more than the loss caused by withholding the opponent something. With more players there is a quicker rotation and thus some forcing to make the choice in your disadvantage. But that wasn't the biggest problem, really: I found Suburbia to be a very calculative game. There is no visual feedback as to how well you're doing, or some other player, for that matter. There is also no easy way to see what an opponent is up to: the tiles are, from afar, bland, and the interesting bit is small text which is hard to read upside down. And on top of that there are tiles which affect and are affected by those already placed, including over at other players' domains! Crikey. Talk about creating complex tile interactions for no good reason! All in all the game was a bit of a letdown. I might play again with more players, but to be honest I'm not holding my breath for the occasion: it will come out of Glen More's table time, after all.

This is much like the card game, "The City". Much like it you need to track what others are doing, but focus on what your goal is. Try to win one public goal and your own. Doublets are very powerful don't forget to use them. The game is variable depending on the tiles in the mix giving replayability.

possibly my favorite game.  I really like that the theme is integrated into the game in a way that helps new players understand the mechanics.  Random enough to allow everyone a chance to win but still has interesting decisions about which of the resources to pursue and when.

Reminds me of SimCity somewhat. This is a tile-laying game where you are building up your own spearate cities and trying to manage various types of buildings (commercial, residential, industrial, and government) to yield you the best result. You have to manage your income, reputation, and population throughout the game. The bigger your population gets, the more difficult it is to manage your reputation and income levels. Placing tiles typically give you an immediate benefit but will occasionally affect previously-placed tiles on both your city and your opponent's city. This game is well-worth your time.

Enjoyable game that's very easy to get to the table, but with 2 minor niggles. Production quality is not up to standard, several pieces have visible tears on them. The game also features a lot of goals for achieving the "least" of something at the end of the game. Whilst I understand the need for them, they aren't well implemented and you can wind up with very negative situations when two players are competing for a particular least goal, if they tie the players score nothing at all. With the "Most" goals you are at least developing your town and board position, but the least goals mean that you are shutting off options, so you often end up in a mutually self destructive showdown, handing the victory to the person who did not engage, It's a very negative equilibrium as well, because you've usually damaged your board position enough that pulling away won't help, and by doing so, you give free points to the person you were tying with. We've houseruled so that we remove half of the least goals before dealing out, but I feel it was an oversight to make the goals 50/50 Least/Most

Edit: Played this with the expansion and our variant rule where we put half of the least goals back in the box and this game was suddenly very fun again. The addition of bonus and challenge tiles have improved the game dramatically. In the base game, it's conceivably possible to achieve all or most of the public goals and your private goal. With the challenge/bonus tiles, that is no longer the case. So it's a matter of picking your battles. In addition the rewards you gain for each are no longer directly equivalent, so it's a matter of judgement which you pursue. The borders are also incredibly fun. They add a slightly wacky special element to the puzzle that really changes the experience.

RATING: 8.5
For those familiar with Sim City the video game, Suburbia has a similar feel as you try and grow your borough while keeping several factors in balance (income, reputation and population).  Players acquire a hexagonal tile each round and adjust their figures accordingly, with previously placed tiles having potential influence as well.

On the plus side, this game is instantly engrossing, and having player-specific goals to work toward are smart.  There are enough tiles that each game is definitely unique, so the replay value here is high.

The main drawback is downtime - this is a game that really encourages AP, so in a 4-player game you spend too much time waiting around.  (Yes, there are a few player interactions to watch for.)  A minor complaint on the production - the rules and tile description sheets are very light/flimsy.

On the whole, a great game that I know is going to get played regularly in our group.

I'm impressed with this game. After only one play I knew that it is a keeper. The game play is elegant and straight forward. I like how the attributes for each tile makes sense. Putting a school next to factory has negative effects. Putting a highway near your business center has distinct advantages. Building your suburb's reputation leads to more residents. Your opponents building tiles can affect your own suburb so you have to pay attention. The winner of this game will plan ahead, pay attention, and transition his strategy at the right time in the game.  When you win you feel like you outplayed your opponent. Win you lose you know your opponent deserved to win.

This is one of the usuals when being visited by a player/non-player couple. The non-player reads the newspaper and we give Suburbia a go. I have yet to see a similar game - there is a nice variety of tiles and plenty of them are out of play every time. This means, a default-strategy solely based on one or two tiles will bring you any gain. You have to stay flexible.

One grain of salt in the soup though - yesterday we had conflicting public goals (Most Industry, Least Industry). But in the end it took out some of the strain there and left more time to care about the private goals.

Overall, the mechanics are quite straight-forward so that it's easy to explain, however maxing the game requires several plays in order to understand the synergies.

Definite recommendation!

It's a game about building a town. Everyone loves the idea of a SimCity game. There's a lot of different opportunities among the different building tiles. You have to judge the market and what's most valued on the table. It never gets old: building something up from nothing. There's an old adage: location, location, location. But it really should be: location and timing, location and timing, location and timing. I suppose that lacks the same ring...

Mechanistic and clunky. The scoring is flawed--if your secret goal lines up with the public ones you're golden, and if it doesn't you're screwed.

Fairly simply game from a mechanics/rules perspective, but can lead to some really complicated calculations when it comes not only to your own decision trees, but your opponents as well if you're trying to stay on top of the kind of tiles you need to deny them. And then there's the book keeping of all the continuous effects as more tiles get placed in everyone's tableaus.

Naturally I'm not capable of doing well at any of the above of course, but it's the kind of game where others can and will help you out with the necessary tracking, so it's not that much of a detriment. 

Anyway, it's a really good game that I personally don't feel the need to own for the time being because I have access to it via my main gaming group. If I get to the point where I want to play it with my family, I might pick up a copy. But it's definitely something everyone in the hobby should try at least once.

The designer clearly borrowed from Through the Ages here. unfortunately, the lighter game with a spatial mechanic and city-building theme doesn't compare to the game by which it was influenced. The end game scoring itself just ruins the game. 

Purchasing tiles and placing them in your burough in order to benefit from them. Spatial in the sense that where you place it relative to other tiles will affect your income or reputation. Score is population plus bonus points for specific goals at game end (goals change from game to game). Negative seems to be that start player is a pretty significant disadvantage with no benefit at all. End-game goals (most of x, or fewest of x) score between 10 and 20 points each, and ties go to no one. Three of these goals are face up for all players from the beginning of the game, but each player has one "secret" goal that only he knows about (but can still be earned by any player).

It's my wife's favorite game and the one I can't seem to figure out. It feels like I'm always late to grab a tile or I over pay. Never seem to find that sweet spot. I'm also not a fan of the random goals. You can just get a bad amount of luck in the goal tiles so either you're looking at conflicting goals or, worse yet, things that are similar and missing out basically shoots the whole game for you. 

At 18 plays, I'm a little burned out and keeping this one on the shelf. Maybe I'll change my rating when I get around to it again.

[17 Jul 2017] - 7.25 (20 plays)
This game climbed back up the ratings for me. It still has a ton of randomness to the market that comes up and the goal tiles that you get to see. Despite that, I have started to see how the tile market forces some tough decisions and that you do need to remove tiles from the market that would give your opponent a huge gain by making them lakes or destroying them when building standard buildings. I don't see it climbing further and becoming my favorite but it can make for a good evening. 

[9 Jan 2018] - 7.5 (21 plays)
Another play after some time in between plays has let me really appreciate what is happening in this game. There is luck in the order of the tiles that come out and the goals that appear in the game. There is also a lot of ways to mitigate and work around the systems in the game. Turning tiles into lakes or taking the standard tiles to deny opponents is a perfectly acceptable thing to do. It does give a bit of take that to the game but I'm not opposed to it. I still see limited use of the reinvestment markers in games but maybe that's their use. They really pay off if you can get a waterfront realty office early and then combine that with a most lakes goal. I think this one will stay in the collection for a long time but isn't a game that I want to pull out every week.

I've played this game more than any other game that's come out in the last couple years, and I never get sick of it.  I can teach it to non-gamers and play it with my gamer buddies.  It's not too long, not too short, and plays differently every time.  The only thing keeping it from a 10 is that I feel that the "least of X tiles" goals don't work in a 2p game, as it creates a standoff where no one buys tiles of that type.  (It seems to work fine in 3+ games).  If I leave those tiles out it's a great 2p game, though I think 3 is the sweet spot.  4 is a little too chaotic for me.

I usually don't like expansions but its expansion is also great, now that we have that, we'll always play with it.

Tough to rate this one.

It definitely has a unique sort of puzzle aspect to it and the ideas, mechanics and tiles are nice. But it also has--at best--only moderate player interaction.

It seems that the end-game bonuses might occasionally lead to a bit of a broken ending. One person's 20 "sure" points could be lost (or worse, end up becoming someone else's 20 points).

Lastly, this is exactly the sort of game my wife and I will play "to the penny"... which means it's wall-to-wall calculating and recalculating to try to eke out every single point. This gets tiresome and causes the last third of the game (in particular) to slow considerably for us. I suspect 90 minutes would be an absolute minimum for us, even with just two players.

One of those games where you're each building your own solitaire layout, but have to pay careful attention to what everyone else is doing (not to mention what they've already done and what they're likely to do). Keeping track of everything can really slow down play.

The difference in our game came down to the fact that one player had a 15-point hidden goal and another had a 10-point hidden goal. The 15-point goal was certainly not 50% harder to complete than the 10-point goal. Close games are cool but that didn't feel quite right for a game with so much thinking involved.

It's interesting, but I'm not sure yet how much I enjoy playing it.

The tracks for each player for income and victory points that get adjusted every turn remind me of the similar ones in Vegas Showdown. To a lesser extent, the way that earlier-played tiles can benefit later placements reminds me of Glen More. While an essential aspect of the game, that feature also is my only knock against the game. Assessing all the effects from all the tiles when a new one is placed can take a bit of time, as you are doing the assessment not only for your own area but also for others' areas. There's a lot to keep track of with four players.

Ranking stays the same. I enjoy the Inc. expansion with the borders and the extra risk/reward they give you. The new tiles are good, too, but as the rule book warns, mixing them in can cut down on the potential of interactivity.  

[February 2016 - 7.5]
Suburbia has grown on me after the first few plays. The rules are a little fiddly at first, but once you get it and remember the "for each" and "for every" "for etc." rules, then it starts to roll. It's the right amount of time for a game and the different goals provide different strategies each game. I need to try the first expansion (Inc.) to add a little more variety.

Played prototype and enjoyed it.  After further plays, though, I'm less excited by it.  To me it was a lot of trying to look and think ahead that was dashed by random chance ("Hey look, none of the tiles I was playing for came out").  That's fine for a shorter game, but this is not short.

This is rapidly becoming one of my all-time favorite games.  I love the depth and complexity, and the replayability is awesome!  No two games are ever the same.

Extra note: If you own this game, you owe it to yourself to get Broken Token's custom-made storage insert.  It is absolutely fantastic!  It makes setting up and putting away so much easier that the game becomes several degrees more accessible.  A game this good should be played often, and the insert makes it so very much easier.  Go get it.  Now.  You will not regret it.

Easy to teach and play but harder to play well it seems. I liked the game but there's simply too much stuff to update after each play to make this really enjoyable. I doubt any has managed to play a full game without missing one modifier update or another.

What I did like was the scoring track, you want more population, at the same time that you don't want them too fast as it will lower your income too much. Nicely done.

This is an odd one because I bought this purely based on what my mum told me she would want in a game and she hates it so that didn't work out so well. I find it OK but the scoring is extremely fiddly and I don't find the replay factor that high even though you technically get different buildings to choose from each time. It is also a little long without enough game to keep it going in our opinions.

I think I like Castles of Mad King better.  This one is good, but there are a lot of combo questions that came up that weren't intuitive.  I didn't care for having to remember that someone adding something to their tableau impacted mine.  It was too easy to forget and the when I remembered, usually discussions had to be had on what that actually meant.   In the end though, I thought it was a good game...but kind of low on the fun factor.

superb elegant strategy game. All the mechanics come together perfectly in a web of interconnected repercussions. is a game where you build your suburban sprawl each turned growing and feeling the pride of doing so. But you have to be aware that every decision you make will also affect others around you. This game gives you a real sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. there seems to be a bit of a runaway leader problem in certain play throughs but this is due to the skill of the player.

RATING: 5
Players are developing their own municipality in a city, attempting to score the most population points.  Straightforward playing game where players on their turn acquire a hexagonal tile from a draft/purchase line, paying the cost plus a premium based on the position in the line.  Tiles not purchased slide down the line and become cheaper.  Purchased tiles are then fitted into their suburb, triggering synergies based on adjacent tiles, other tiles in the suburb, and even other tiles in the city (i.e. the other players).  These triggers bump income (money), prestige (population growth) and instant population (victory points).  Income is earned (which may be negative), population attracted (again which may be negative, that is, they leave), and the tile drafting line adjusted.  Play until the game end is triggered, throw in some hidden bonus tiles to make it semi-interesting, most points wins.

It looks lovely, generates a nice thematic feeling of city growth.  For the first 30 minutes of this game I was quite taken with it, then it hit me why I was enjoying it so much - I was playing Through The Ages.  It went rapidly downhill from there.  As a 45 minute two player game, this would be better.

If you've been reading my other comments, you may notice my use of the word "elegant" quite a bit, but if I'm going to be brutally honest, this game wins that word.  The mechanics are extremely simple, intuitive, and realistic, and yet there is so much depth in this box that you really will get better and better at the game the more you play.  The variability replay factor is very high without needing an expansion, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.  A fantastic design.

Fun tile placement games with a lot of connectivity. The flow of the game is quite good (place a tile or a doubler and see the effect), but it's got more meat to it than most tile placement games as most tiles cause ripples to happen, giving you more income/reputation/population. I like the population track with it's built in speed-bumps, making sure that every game should be somewhat close. Fun times
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After two plays, I love how the mechanisms really compliment the theme of this game. All of the resource tracks are very intuitive, and the real-estate market seems to work smoothly. It's important not to over calculate while playing; decisions have to be made based on a gut feeling of what the best option is, rather than precise calculation of all the alternatives (otherwise AP kicks in big time); but the choices are not so overwhelming that you are left with no idea of what to do. The buying/placing decisions are definitely the fun part of this game, but once made, implementing those decisions is a bit of an accounting exercise (which is why it might work better as an iOS app where all the accounting is done for you).  

I am considering adding a house rule that player are not forced to remove tiles from the market each turn; instead they have the option. This would give a little more control over the game end condition, which I would like, but it would obviously make the game a little longer. The game is already long enough for my tastes, but it definately does not feel as long as it takes (which is a sign of a great game).

After reading the rules...
Looks like a nice game that would make a good gift.

While I would like to play it sometime, it does not seem to be a game I need to own. 

UPADTE: Curse you Rhado, maybe I do need this game!

UPDATE AFTER PLAYING:
This was the first game I sought out at Unity Games 20, and I got a chance to play it with some friends.  After getting over my immediate reaction that I had played poorly, I liked it.  I really enjoyed how thematic the tiles were; the action of each made sense.  While I was punished by the impact of population growth, I appreciate why it is there.  One must prepare for the growth of their suburb or one will get bogged down towards the end.  I also did not mind the fiddliness of the scoring with each tile placement; I though that the interaction this produced was worth the hassle.

So, I would definitely like to play it again, and I think my wife would like it, but I am not quite convinced enough to buy it.  Shelf space in my house is a prized commodity, and I am not sure Suburbia makes the cut.  Suburbia gives me a similar feeling to two games that have earned shelf tenure: Attika and Vegas Showdown.  Suburbia won't be knocking either of these to the trade pile.  So, we'll see what the future brings for Suburbia and the Asher house.

UPDATE Feb 2014:  Broke down and bought it. along with expansion.  I want to play this some more to see if I can pull off managing the population growth.  This game will either open up for me, or worst case I will find it a new home.  It is officially interviewing for shelf space!

Gameplay and design are well conceived. Very thematic. Components are of a good quality, but had some difficulty punching. It can take a bit setting up the tile stacks, but that's only a minor issue.

I didn't expect too much when i played for the first time: during that first run i loved it!
Secret goal drives your strategy, but you can also choose to get one or more public goals.
It's interactive and got easy rules, and interesting it's the way population (=victory points) is handled: whoever has the most, wins. 
But each time a player crosses one of the red lines due to a population gain, they lose both an income and reputation point. As the little borough gets larger, it costs more to maintain. While I "hate" those red lines, as a player, I think it’s a very good choice as far as game mechanics are concerned, because it prevents early leaders from running away with the game and forces players to be careful about which tile they choose and when. 
I think it’s a nice check and balance to make sure players don’t expand too quickly, and to allow players not in first to have a chance to catch up.
Good relaxing strategy game for gamers and non-usually gamers!

Suburbia takes an odd stance somewhere between fun and mechanical, but does so with enough gusto to garner at least some level of interest from most people. The fun is borne from the same place as any tile-placement game, especially where you're given your own town to work on - watching your neighborhood grow into something magnificent.

However, the effects of these tiles leads to the biggest issue with Suburbia - constant administration. Every time a tile is put down you're required to check all of your tiles - and not just adjacent ones nor just ones put down by you. This can get particularly exhausting in the late game, and I guarantee you most players will inevitably miss something or other before the game is over.

PERSONAL COPY. The theme is, simply put very cool. Why certain buildings do certain things make perfect sense.

It's very solitaire but there is also an interesting dynamic where what your opponents build affects you as well, even if there is no direct interaction between boroughs.

My only complaint is that the constant book-keeping in the game makes it certain that you'll be missing a bunch of points at the end.

RATING: 6.9
This'd be a 7 if people didn't keep suggesting it all the time.  It's a nifty game and puzzle, trying to arrange your suburb for maximum efficiency.  Lots of different buildings, although I feel like some of them are much better than others.
Money's very tight, especially later on when the prices start to shoot up.  It's nice that you always have the option to place a lake and generate some cash, but a lot of the time, they don't give you very much, and it takes your whole turn to do.  If you're not careful early, or there just aren't good income-generating choices when it's your turn, you could be forced into a spiral of insolvency.
My only serious complaint is with the PR firm and Casino buildings.  Those just seem overpowered to me.  If you get the Casino when you have a solid income base already, then you can spend the rest of the game shoveling money into reputation increases.  If you wind up with the PR firm,  you can hit 15 reputation and spend the rest of the game finding ways to fight the loss of cash.  And if you somehow get both, then you just blow the doors off the game, and everyone else might as well concede.
Still pretty much the best 'SimCity on a table' I've played.

Very good.  Best city sim out there imo.  So thematic.  Much of the game's scoring, buying, and tile placement mechanics represent effects found in your city/town.  Love it.  

Dislike the art style and wish they made it easier to pick out logos and effects on the tiles, but this improves with more plays.

[b][2ndImpressionOnApril9th2014][/b] My first experience with the game was terrible, mainly because I learned the game under pressure. I normally don't like to read the rulebook of a new game and then play it right after that, hence the blowout experience. 

So I get to play the game for the 2nd time after over a year, and the experience was totally different. A friend of mine taught us the game, together with Suburbia Inc. and the I find it to be fun. I enjoyed my play and find that managing your payout and population track are interesting. You just need to find when to go slow, build your economy and then make a change of pace on your population before the game is over.

However, I don't find myself owning the game. I find it to be okay, and I don't feel the need for me to own it.

Absolutely one of my favorite games, if not the favorite. It's smart, it's easy to teach and learn, it's difficult to combo really well, but once you do it's very satisfying, and if you can't it's easy enough to survive, go for goals, and possibly win solely on that. Check it out if you haven't, and I'll play it with anyone anytime.

Comments after one 4 player game.
Suburbia felt like a really great combo generating game (like if castles of Burgundy had more pasture type mechanics). You'll find yourself building your economy and attracting new residents. But at each milestone you take a hit to each track.

The fun part of the game is finding combos in the tike you have, and your opponents have. Jimmy placed a suburb, my homeowners association gives me $2, thanks Jimmy!

The downside is every move must 've reevaluated by every player to check to see if anything triggers. While I'm not too upset about this, I prefer when people pay attention to the game rather than checking out, i did find it to distract a little from the enjoyment of the game.

Compared to COMKL where that game has powers that trigger when placing tiles, and completing rooms, but no prolonged status checks.

Based on my few plays of both thus and COMKL,  this seems to be the deeper game, but I think I'd rather play castles....which before playing thus game, I would have bet it would be the other way around.

Competitive city building simulation where few players are building their own boroughs from the public offer of hexagons. There are five types of hexagons each with dozens of different building which all interact well with adjacent tiles, or whole borough or even the whole city.

Every time I play Suburbia I can't help but comment on how much of a darn fine game it is.  There's a lot to think about in Suburbia, but the turn sequence is so simple that everything gets boiled down into manageable chunks.  The tile effects cleverly match both the theme and game mechanics.  In other words, what the PR Firms, Parking Lots, Airports, Homeowner's Associations, Universities, etc. do make a whole lot of sense.   All the great and intriguing elements of city building games were carefully distilled and squeezed onto every piece of this game.  If you want a city building game, this is it!  Suburbia does lack a certain level of interaction and tension I enjoy though, but like I said, it's still a darn fine game.   I give it a lot of props as well as a lot of play.  

Two year update:  Despite it being in the top 50 games on BGG, this game doesn't get the recognition it deserves.  Perhaps it needs a graphic overhaul, more intuitive/thematic iconography, and a more effective player aid.  I could see this being a game in every family's closet.

Loved *almost* everything about this game. Feels like Alhambra meets Power Grid and Sim City. Solid components, logical gameplay, and fun. EXCEPT the accounting was a major hassle. Ruined the experience. This is a game where the person who scores their score most accurately has it all over those people who forget to fiddle with all their tracking and make certain they score all their bonuses right. I hate that in a game. I want to win because I played well, not because I made the fewest accounting errors when I scored my turn. If ever a game demanded a digital version, it's this one, simply for the game accounting alone.

Pros: Easy to teach/learn; quick to set up; plays well with 3-4 players. Cons: Does not play well with two players because the variety of tiles doesn't rotate enough and there isn't a lot of competition for most tiles; if you don't build up your cash flow right from the start then you are mostly limited to the basic tiles available; there are too many of the red lines on the population track that cause you to lose 1 income and 1 reputation, not only because this is quite punishing, but also because this seems to limit strategy a lot. If, instead of going for a strong income strategy, you go for a populous suburb strategy, then your already low income gets hit hard by crossing all of these red lines. It was probably meant to be a catch-up mechanism, but it feels too limiting and punishing...

10? Seriously?

This might adjust down after a few more plays, but right now it's really hot for me.  This rating is after only two (4p) games. What will bump it down?  If the limits of the Suburbia universe close in too quickly. We'll see what replayability looks like.  Already I'm seeing that there could be favorite tiles. (but, unlike my other favorite game, Ground Floor, you don't know what tiles are coming up or when ... even the price will vary).

Set up is okay, not a ton of stuff to try to manage.  Playtime is about perfect 4p=90 minutes.

Strategy?  Yeah ... pretty fair.  Your secret goal drives your strategy.  Tactics sometimes amount to just staying alive (or not going broke) on a given turn.

The goals (private and public) are totally awesome.  It adds a very fun element to the game.

Like I said ... might shave this down a bit.  But for now it belongs at the top.

December 2013 ... I've got multiple plays in now and it's still pretty solid at a 10.

This is a spreadsheet game with a paper thin, tacked on theme. Many reviews allude to some kind of kinship with sim-city (a game I love dearly), but that's complete rubbish, and I'll tell you why. You have no creative freedom in this game, and even if, by some stroke of luck, you were able to get all of the pieces you wanted, all you've really created is a butt-ugly hex-tile chain...

I'm glad I paid less than $10 for this title, as opposed to the $100+ the physical game would have cost, because it's pretty awful. I think a pretty fundamental rule of gaming is "don't be boring", and Suburbia is boring AF.

Looks like a game that takes a few games to get the hang of. I never knew what to expect, what would come out and some of the tricks (eg don't buy a casino when you have no reputation!) but it seemed fun and easy to get the hang of the rules, next is the strategies!

RATING: 6
Game has interesting strategy decisions, but is lacking in theme integration.  Game play is very computational; the only things that matter about the tiles available to a player are their statistics -- you don't buy a park because you have a vision of a lovely city with tree-filled public green space; you buy it because you've computed it's effect upon your reputation and income values. Slightly frustrating mechanism which punishes advances on the scoring track with income and reputation reductions.  Recommended in system optimization interests you in a game, otherwise just another Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Way too AP inducing since not only do you have to track the combo effects on your own board but other boards in play as well making it way too easy to miss numerous  powers in play (seems ideal for an iOS implementation that would be free from error prone play).  In addition, players have the ability to remove tiles in order to deny others from getting them but that requires full knowledge of dozens of other tiles around the table.  Tedious would be an understatement.  Hidden bonus tiles seemed rather swingy as well.

Awfully pleasant and quick. Manages to hide its fundamental nature as multiplayer solitaire rather well. The only interaction is the minor buying of tiles and the occasional bonus for all tile types. The latter is only great for the owner since no one really cares if they get two bucks for every house. 

All very fun throughout, but the scoring bothers me. It always puts a bit of a damper on the game. It is really just the objective tiles which feel unfair. The point values are not balanced. To win because of them, which happens more often than not, feels cheap...

[2 plays] I don't know when I've found a game as thematically repulsive as this one. And mechanically, when every tile anyone plays can affect and be affected by every other tile ANYONE has played the entire game, that's just asking for a constant stream of oversights and errors.

RATING: 8
Medium weight tile placement game.  When I read the rules I thought this would be very mediocre.

I was extremely surprised as we were playing it.  The tiles are immensely thematic and all of them work both mechanically and thematically (except maybe the lakes, but they need to be there for gameplay purposes).

There is a good chunk of indirect player interaction as well, both for competing for the public goals and for the city-wide tiles.

e:  After too many plays way too fast, traded this.  Got way too repetitive and didn't feel like I was making interesting decisions.  

e2: Trying to trade for this again now that the amazing looking expansion is out.

Modern classic, right up there with the likes of Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, and Settlers. Spectacular Light-Medium Euro. Mechanics work with the theme to make the game super easy to teach and play but there's plenty of interesting decisions to make. It takes longer to set up than many other games of it's weight and length, and you MUST pay attention to all of the tiles effects. Bookkeeping in this game is critically important.

This game played exactly as I imagined it would as in good not great. Another "solid but don't need to own it" game for me (plus, my friend won it in the raffle. Huzzah!). I'm generally not a fan of tile laying games; I find them dry and abstract. But I would play this one on occasion. This should be a big hit among the BGG crowd (which values tile laying games much more than I), and the fact that I like it at all should translate as a ringing endorsement.

The bidding track appeals to me most as you jockey to be able to afford projects and you can remove projects that opponents might be gunning for. The combos force you to stay apprised of who has what tiles so you can't just sit back and play your own game in a vacuum. A solid, meaty filler but not the kind of game that will ever be a main attraction for me.

Prefer Alhambra, or Castles of Mad King Ludwig over this game for tile laying games.  Interactions are a pain in the butt to account for (seems very clunky from an upkeep and scoring calculating standpoint).  The rules are also very poorly written (way too many ambiguities or unclear or unexplained situations) - so you never know if you are doing the interaction/calculations correct or not.  Also, kind of dull from the graphics/artwork perspective (although maybe that's intentional as suburbs are stereotypically portrayed as bland vanilla places to live?).

This is one of the most interesting new games to come out in the last few years. I love the city-building aspect and how each tile has the potential to interact with other tiles. My first 2 games were 4-player and I was surprised that the game was more recommended for 2 players. Then I played a 2-player game and saw the difference. More unique tiles come out for a 4-player game, but you have a better chance to get the tiles that do come out in a 2-player game. I definitely want to play this more.

Suburbia is a tile laying game. You lay different types of hex tiles to develop your suburb. Each hex tile interacts with the others in slightly different ways depending on what hexes are next to it, that you have placed anywhere and/or have been placed by the other players. The tiles can affect your population (which will also be the victory points), your income (which will decrease as your population increases) and your reputation (which will increase or decrease your population).

There are also other goals that can add to your final score if you meet the condition, some of which are open but each player also knows one secret goal. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tile laying game where each tile interacts with all tiles next to it. Whilst this is a little fiddly at first after a round or two you get the hang of it. 

Income and reputation need to be managed and if your population grows to quickly (due to large reputation) you can suddenly find yourself very short of money as there are penalties to both income and reputation at various points on the scoreboard. This is a very clever self regulating mechanic that forces players to balance their city.

I really like that the mechanics fit the theme, for example placing suburbs next to airports has a negative effect, after all who wants to live near the airport? The stationary supply store does well when placed next to several offices, little interactions like this mean its not simply a case of purchasing the most expensive (and therefore best?) tile from the river of tiles but more about looking to purchase what is best for you at that moment... which can be totally different to everyone else at the table.

Lots of very varied strategy's here and using only half the tiles each play means a lot of re playability.

Several public goals and each player having a secret goal is also nice as it gives some focus before the game begins however some of the points awarded seem fairly random which means some goals will never be picked as they are too difficult for too little gain.

Not my kind of game at all. Intellectually, I understand it, and no doubt people that like that kind of thing will like this version. But for me, it's a spreadsheet style game. +1 here, -2 there, this adds to this and so on. Almost nil inter-action, it's the kind of game robots would like. Not me.

Plus, almost no attempt at graphic design or artwork. Good use of colours, text and icons, but it looks like a working prototype, not a finished product.

June 2014 - Solid fun. Three main complaints: bookkeeping in this game is mildly irritating; graphic design looks like MS Paint; the game's theme is great but there is a strange de-emphasis on residential area which detracts from theme a bit.

Essen 2012: liked it a lot. Somebody said to me "It's SimCity as a board game" and I tend to agree.
However, what kept me from buying this one is that you have to keep track on many things(e.g. some of your tiles are automatically activated every time a competitor buys a tile of the same kind).
 That's not a problem per se for me, howver,this can be overlooked VERY EASILY. This could have been easily be avoided if these tiles would have had some kind of marking (color, cube to be placed on it etc.). 
Of course I could add cubes taken from other games or maark these tile with a magic marker but for me I don't buy games if I feel something is missing.

second game in April: I cannot really say why but I liked it far less than the first game during Essen 2012. Downgraded from 8 to 6

Between this and Castles of MKL, this is the better game. I can say that with confidence after only 1 game of Suburbia and about 15 of MKL. More depth, tougher choices, and NO master builder! Though building a castle seems like the more fun theme, Suburbia's city building is quite enjoyable. There's more thought to this game too. You don't just buy a tile and plunk it somewhere. Whatever you choose can affect your own city as well as everyone else's. I love that concept. Rating may go up after more plays, but it's definitely a solid 9 right now. Can't wait to get it to the table again soon.

Truly fantastic game. Very well balanced, hits the sweet spot in terms of complexity and time, and every game takes on a completely different character depending on the combination of goals and the tiles drawn (especially with fewer players or the expansion). Best of all is the sense of creating something unique and personal you get from the interlocking tiles. Sure, it's not the prettiest game visually, but the artwork is functional enough for its purpose and is always very clear. One of my absolute favourites.

I wake up in the morning and catch a ride to the factory. It’s not a great place to work, but it pays the bills. And it’s by a lake. Sometimes I ride my bike to the amusement park near the projects, or shotgun beers down by the train tracks. This used to be a small town nuzzled into the edge of the desert. Now it’s booming. But the hipsters are leaving. There’s a contiguous line of civic buildings downtown. Not a lot of business, but probably enough to win this game. 

I like the narrative arc of this game and always wanted to play sim city competitively. And I love all the different buildings and combos. But the problem is, although you are competing against your opponents on the score track, there’s very little if any interaction between the players during the game. Pretty much head-to-head solitaire with a small amount of screwage in the card row via lakes. I wish the game had more interaction and its playtime is a little too long for a game with so much luck.

Great game and I can see how it's so enjoyable, but to me it's just in the "solid, will replay whenever" category. We've got so many other options that this will probably only hit the table every 2-3 sessions or so. Still, that's saying something for our group (we rotate between probably 6-9 regular games plus dozens of others in the mix).

My one real knock against this game design is that with 2 people, it's easy to plan ahead on the real estate market whereas with 4 people it's almost impossible. I haven't played with 3 yet, but it might be the sweet spot... I just don't know when I'll ever have a group of 3.

Have acquired the Suburbia Inc expansion but not yet played with it. Looks fun. Plan to buy the other expansion as well (5*).

Nagyon egyzerű szabályok, aránylag rövid játékidő, nagy kombinációs lehetőségek, aránylag mély tematika. Pont nekem való. :)
Egy-két dolog miatt azonban mégsem annyira:
- a komponensek olyanok, mintha egy prototípus lenne.
- a piac elég sok szerencsét visza  játékba, mivel az állandó pénzhiány miatt reálisan, csak az első 4 lapot lehet megvenni
- a minden játékos épületére vonatkozó bónuszok észben tartása és adminisztrálása szinte lehetetlen, illetve rengeteg energiát elvesz a valódi játéktól
- végül a legkellemetlenebb. A titkos célok teljesen agyoncaspják a játékot. Ugyebár a játékot végigköveti egy erőltetett (ám tematikus) egyensúlyozás, ami miatt különösebben nem lehetnek nagy pontkülönbségek a végére. Node akkor jön a feketeleves, és valaki kap plusz 20 pontot egy olyan célre, ami teljesen egybeesett egy nyílt még plusz 10 pontos céllal. Másnak meg a közös célokkal ellentétes cél jut, ami ráadásul csak 10 pontot ér, vagy olyan random, hogy alig van rá hatással (pl legkevesebb pénz a játék végén). 

Szeretnék még játszani vele, kiszedném a titkos célokat. Simán lehet ez még 8-9 között valahol, mert alapjaiban szuper jó játék.

City engine building. Tiles you buy affect income and VP generation, and in most cases combine with other tiles in your or other players' suburbs for increased leverage. Buy more tiles for bigger effect. Repeat.

That might sound a bit simplistic, and it mostly is. The raw engine is easily visible through the city building theme layer, yet the game manages to stay thematic enough that the placements and their effects "make sense." The individual player goals help with diversification so that people don't go after the same tiles all the time which, along with only a selection of tiles being in play each game, hopefully dispels replayability concerns. Suburbia doesn't revolutionise urban planning, but it's a solid medium-weight design.

Suburbia has some very interesting city building ideas and thematically it works very well! I'm not a fan of the art, nor am I a fan of having to keep checking people's boards as they play (as there are some global effects that can be easily missed if you're not paying attention at all times). The iconography works fine enough. I love games where items decrease in cost as the game continues, and it's done very well here. Overall, Suburbia is a game I enjoy quite a bit, but there's just a few sticky points that keeps me from thinking it's marvelous. I'm certainly interested in trying Castle of Mad King Ludwig to see if I enjoy that one more than this.

Went into this hoping it would be SimCity but it's just a generic hex game.  Tiles and art are bland and the theme is pasted on.  Mechanics are fine but it's not a city building game and didn't deliver a SimCity/city building feel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Where to start?  Firstly I began the game making what I assumed to be a grave mistake - I poorly processed the engine at work and invested more through thematic thinking rather than game mechanics.  I made the error of purchasing cards that dealt me population (thinking I need workers) and in-advertantly purchased the VP hexes rather than the engine producing hexes.  Needless to say this drove my economy into the gutter.  I was at a penalty of minus 2 early on and with no cash on hand was forced to make lake grabs most turns, with some X2 usage to just get a small hand of cash.  After five or six further turns I had enough to purchase the most basic of hexes.  So I did. This never got me out of my death spiral financially and was bleeding money every round.  

So why am I saying all of this?  

Well I checked out of the game mentally.  I did what the game allowed me to do.  I had no real choices.  I was doomed from my early mistake.  

It must be noted I was playing with very experienced and very competent gamers.  All of whom had played before.  

So to all of our surprise when the game was over and final scoring took place I was in second over all by 2 points - beating third and fourth by 15+.  Remember I had tapped out.  I was not mentally engaged with the game, and I was resigned to make only the moves I could. No choices.  The game was running on auto-pilot for me.  

So when this occurs with competent players at the table playing to their best, and I almost win because of some balancing mechanism or randomness.   I claim broken. 

I am all for balancing designs, but when it takes meaningful play away from the game - BOOOOOOOO!!!!!

RATING: 7.5
I really like the theme and its implementation. Only played solitaire yet, but it seems that there are not so many different viable strategies. Since you start at 0 income, everyone has to build an economic engine in order to be able to purchase tiles. This makes the green tiles contra-productive and most games so far I haven't played more than 1 green tile during the entire game. I want to play more and explore what strategies are viable.
Edit: I did play again with 3 players and the person with most green won the game, despite pitiful economy! The goal were very important too and I can see a lot of strategy coming out of this game!

Fun. I love city-building/civilization-building games, and here you do feel like you're building a little city, and while some people may find it a little fiddly (there's a fair bit of accounting involved, and it's easy to screw it up if you're not careful), I don't mind.

RATING: 9
Great for what it is: A quieter borough building game with various tiles having cumulative effects. One must pay attention to neighbors and their boroughs- since there are many tiles in their area that can affect you (and vice versa), so this is not a solitaire game. It's quite satisfying as your neighborhood begins to sprawl, but becomes more challenging when trying to maximize earning potential vs. too rapid population growth. I enjoy the clean art style on the tiles. This game works great for newbies and gamers alike. A "9" only with the expansion.

A game of tile placement, in which you're looking for tile combinations which can score a lot of points.  Moves along pretty well.

It somehow manages to have a bunch of interesting "card" interactions between your own suburb and (sometimes) other suburbs without bogging down - it's the city-building game URBAN SPRAWL wanted to be... but wasn't. 

After 4 plays, I'm convinced that the real strength of the game is the delicate balance between gamer-y decisions & the sweet thematic joy of how your city/suburb grows & expands. It's a winner.

Light-medium tile placement game, with the illusion of more control than you actually have.  The draws come down a display, costing more for the newest tiles, but because of the way the economy slowly progresses, the ability to overcome draws is actually quite limited.

Good midweight economic game. Biggest criticism is that there is way too much to keeps track of, especially with tiles that affect a specific type of building, anywhere in the board, which it's easy to lose track of. Happy Eeconomic Hex-Based Tile Laying Game Fest!

Played 2-player, and it goes very quickly and is enjoyable. You have to strike a balance between getting a lot of income early on, but not completely neglecting your reputation, otherwise you will fall too far behind. Secret goals are good, constantly changing real estate market is good (although halfway through the game, we had so much money that it didn't matter where the building was in the market, we just bought whatever we wanted -- so maybe there needs to be some balance tweaking). 

My only complaint would be that there are too many interacting buildings to keep track of. By the end, it was quite a chore to play a building and figure out all of its effects. And that was only with 2 players! More would be even worse.

City building, tile laying, slight bidding. This game is simple to teach and play, and yet can be very cutthroat! Your plans can be wrecked but you'll have fun. I'll have to play some more to find more viable strategies (some tiles seem really powerful.) I'm also curious about the expansions.

Great city building, tile placement game. 
Contrary to most tile placement games where the luck factor is big and you don't interact much with your opponent, in Suburbia you can develop a strategy that will take you to victory by considering what you and your neighbor is doing in his suburb.

RATING: 8
Rock solid theme makes what might be a mathy game fun and even addictive. It really feels like you're building a community with all its pros and cons. Building a movie theater near a suburb will please your population whereas building a factory too close will anger them. Random draws of building tiles make for a different borough every time, but that's okay because there are multiple paths to victory.

A deceptively short game that offers a breadth of viable paths, and that generates some very interesting and opaque pacing decisions. There is quite a lot of computation to track, and it's easy to get this wrong if anyone's attention wanders.

I really love Suburbia. It's a relaxing game for me. Lots of decisions and strategies to pursue, and it's nice to have something medium-weight that isn't too competitive to have in my collection. The only downside (and this is a common complaint) is that the game almost requires you to focus on money before focussing on gaining population. While it absolutely makes sense thematically, I feel like some people might be turned off by this, as it can feel quite same-y. Nonetheless, Suburbia is one of my favourite games, and for its overwhelmingly good qualities, it will stay in my collection for a very long time :)

There are many card games that are inspired by "the boardgame". Suburbia is the opposite. This boardgame feels being inspired by the small card game "The City". Don't know if it is like that or pure coincidence. While The City is too straightforward, Suburbia offers a gamer some interesting choices too keep growth balanced (= key factor to success). A solid design but gamewise a bit on the dry side as you calculate each tile for its cost/use factor.

Played one game with 3 players. Of the games I played during Essen 12 there were 4 medium heavy weight, 2 hour Euros which I thought were fantastic. Suburbia, Keyflower, Tzolk'in and Myrmes. With more plays I suppose I will form a favourite but for now I rate them as equally enjoyable. Oct 2012

*UPDATE* played this another couple of times and the game remains interesting. I now rate it level with Keyflower, above Myrmes and below Tzolk'in as far as my Essen 12 medium weight Euros go. August 2013

The tile-drafting and economic pacing (when do you make the move to reputation?) are fun, but there's too much downtime at 4p and I have other games I'd rather play at 2p.

RATING: 7
First Impressions: The game is interesting so far because of the tile placing mechanic. I like how you have to have a good balance between your income and reputation as you gain population because of the red lines that decrease both. I like the abilities of the tiles and how you have to think about where you are placing them to get the most benefit. I need to play a few more games to figure out some of the strategies better.

Second Game: It seems the game tends to end up being about 45 minutes per player and I am still awful

Note: This comment is for Suburbia's base game & it's exps.

I recall my first time that I played Sim City on the PC and created my own city, destroying it, and then rebuilding it to my heart's desire. This game fulfills that in a board gaming sense.

Rating = 7 due to it being fun and challenging and I am always willing to play it. Exp is OK.

I agree with Rahdo that this is one of the best (if not the best) city building games from 2013 and back.

It's wayyy better than The Capitals(which sucks) and different from City Council (which is more a political game than city building).

It also gets crazy in the mid to late game when someone puts a tile "Hey! you've put this tile in your suburb this means I have this", "Oh yeah? I also get this", "Relax guys, just look, with this tile I get ten of this, four these and three of those...". hehe! Pretty crazy game when you get to that point, especially with 3 or more players! :D

I also agree with Rahdo about the thresholds (red lines) on the population board. It's a neat trick to prevent people from hoarding "victory points" easily. You need to work for your victory points.

Although, this game is another victory point game, which I am getting tired of seeing... just too many out there, people seems to lack any form of creative ways to determine a victor to their games. Those and worker placements, I'm getting really tired of seeing those. :(

This is currently one of my favorite games after 27 plays. This includes a combination of iOS games against various AI's, solo sessions without the bot, and 1 on 1 sessions with my gaming buddy. The solo game does not have real legs since you can adapt and exploit the same strategy to get high scores on a regular basis. Random tile selection mitigates this a bit, but if I use a strategy of building income, residential, then school and invest in school there are enough blue and green tiles to make this work solo almost every time. 

Of course, a good playing partner will identify and block your preferred strategy. This, with the addition of goals, make for an interesting play every time. I would advise to play the game solo to learn the tiles then the game really starts to shine as you plan based on the tiles coming out and the goals. I will update again after having more 2 player sessions, but I don't see this one dying out any time soon. Got the expansion which I have yet to add as well.

Good game, even though there's no real interaction between the players. The game suffers from a real bad overview, as you need to know all the tiles in play and those symbols arn't big (laying at the other side of the table).

Adding a sheet where you can note which effects your buildings will have, would help the game tremendously.

Away from that main problem, the tiles feel very similar with no special abilities or such. I think I'll just play a "The City" instead, which plays faster in every aspect.

Not a great game, I struggle to see why so many reviewers have praised it.
Everything is fiddly; from working out your tile machination from multiple other tiles scattered across your (and others') cities every single turn, to the population, income & reputation tracks bouncing wildly up and down to little effect. Add to that the fact that even close games don't have tension (because of the massive swings in the goal tiles) and you can color me unimpressed.

If you enjoyed Sim City or other city building PC games growing up, this is a must own. Definitely the best city building game out there with good theme that makes your city feel alive. Depending on how you place the pieces of your city, you'll gain or lose income and reputation in ways that make sense. No one wants to live next to a factory, but you might need it in order to make money. Plus, I love that what your opponents build is also relevant to you as buildings can get bonuses based on what your opponent has. Great game overall.

Enjoyed my first couple of plays, although it took a while to go through the rules.  It's actually a reasonable-length game, once you get used to it.

There seem to be different strategies to follow -- build airports?  Build lakes?  Build residential?  A lot could depend on the goal cards.  

Perhaps the key to this game is to play tiles in dense clusters.  If you have a concentrated tile which gives you great reputation (population income), you can double that tile with a 2x chit in the mid-game to accelerate your point production through to the finish.  Likewise, if you make a nice hole for a lake, you can get a good cash influx (and possibly double it later with another 2x chit).

It seems important to increase your income (or play lakes effectively) and save money early.  Without money, you can't buy key tiles when they come up (and a new tile comes up after every player's turn).  This is especially true when you play with more players, because you might only have one chance to buy a good tile before it's bought or trashed by someone else.

It's important to notice when a tile says "every" on it.  That means that it applies even to other tiles built by other players!  This can lead to huge windfalls, if you are aware of them... and those windfalls can go to other players just as easily, if you miss your chance.

     After one play (4 players) - Good strategy game.  
              
    Need more plays, saw some negatives because I got whooped:


     1) Tile laying - lame

     2) Theme - I play city building games because the theme is fun.  Building a city definitely  came 2nd to the mechanisms (especially tile laying...)

     3) Goal - I've heard this already, but the fact that there is only 4 goals means that it is very competitive.  Felt like the whole time I was worrying about blocking and not getting blocked as opposed to playing the game.  Yes, I know that doesn't sound like a super negative, and it might not be because I love player interaction and screwing people over.  In addition, it is kind of refreshing to play a game that you can't win just by doing something different (though, you do have your own personal goals) than everyone else. I know that that design is a fad right now because no one likes getting 'blocked', but this negative may turn into a positive after more plays because this game doesn't think I'm a wussy and it wants me to play my best.

     Excited to get more plays and dive into this game!

This is a really great boardgame iteration of SimCity (or similar). The decisions are interesting enough both in terms of what to purchase (in light of both your immediate needs, your long term needs, and end-game goals, as well as preventing opposing players from getting that one tile they need), as well as where to place the tiles (what bonuses and penalties are applied due to this placement). Furthermore, there is the typical money-to-VP element happening here as well (i.e., develop your economy early game and make the shift towards heavy VP development mid-to-late game). However, I have seen more balanced approaches do fairly well as well. Part of this that is interesting (or potentially infuriating to those who like 'clockwork' games) is that the secret objectives might mean that everyone is 'in' until the objectives are revealed (so long as everyone plays in a way that keeps them within striking distance). I am generally neutral about this as the game is not so long that this feels too random at the end either nor is the game so long that it needs some indeterminate elements to alleviate an all-too-foreseeable ending (i.e., games where early mistakes cost you the game) but again, it injects a bit of cloudiness around what folks might be striving towards and give lagging players a hopeful outlook all the way through.

The board game version of the computer game Sim City 2000 !

For those who played the computer game before its like building your own city with residences, offices, parks, lakes, industrial zones, airports, museums, schools, etc.

Build your own city and profit from it! The player with the best and well planned city wins!

A fun and easy to play game. Only takes 30 minutes to explain and play a dummy round for new players.

Suburbia is a tight and well-plotted tile laying game with elements of set collection and resource management, that plays easily, quickly, and yet there is a lot going on at any one moment.

I am liking this more and more as I play it- mind you my scores aren't escalating much yet, but I am enjoying the challenge the game provides.

The speed at which this moves to conclusion is a major bonus here; it does not overstay it's welcome, and I am beginning to be tempted to just leave it out and play at least 2 games when I get it to the table.

The artwork is pleasant, 1960's era vision of the future styled, and not hard on the eyes.  The tiles are plentiful, providing lots of variation in how tile availability changes each game.  the basic actions are simple, but keeping the ship on course and moving forward can be very challenging.

I'm starting this at  7.5 after a few plays, but this may go up- especially once I snag the expansion set.

In short, this is a really solid little game.

(11/30/2013) Comment based on one play, with the Suburbia Inc. expansion.

This is an interesting take on the urban planning, mixing the feel of Carcassonne, Wealth of Nations, SimCity, and Innovation with hexes. 

Each turn a player may draft/buy a hex from a cascading row of hexes (like the cards in Through the Ages), with each hex representing a building zone, such as suburb, industry, commercial, infrastructure, and others. While there is a dollar cost for each hex, the hexes on the right have no additional cost, while the hexes on the left are progressively more expensive. You then locate the hex on your play area. Each hex has various interactions listed on it, denoting incremental/decremental income and/or influence. Income results in a cash payout each turn, allowing you to buy more expensive building hexes, while increasing influence results in population growth.

Early on, the focus is to collect hexes that generate income, and then later switch over to raise influence, in order to increase the overall population of your "suburbia". Population is essentially VP for this game. However, growing population will detract from income and influence, as it reaches specific thresholds. Re-playability is high, with each player having secret objectives, as well as a number of public objectives. Also, the type and number of hexes will vary from game to game.

Play is fast. However, given the range of choices of hexes available to the player, as well as the large decision space on where to put the hex relative to the other hexes, this is an analysis-paralysis' nightmare. With repeated plays, it is just a matter of eliminating the unresourceful combinations, and finding the optimum ones. Still, I did not really enjoy my first game, as I felt like I was playing on auto-pilot. Each turn, given the amount of money I have, there was probably one or two "best" hexes to choose from, and then locating them optimally is a matter of deduction. My first play suffered from the unfamiliarity with the various hexes and the various combos available; I simply played to survive.

In the end, the game did not click with me, since it seemed to be pretty much up to the draw, much like in Carcassonne--draw well, do well; draw badly, do badly. It also reminded me too much of Innovation, another design I dislike, trying to figure out and optimize all the interactions, but with hexes instead of cards. As for having a similar "feel" of Wealth of Nations, which is a more abstract treatment of creating a [i]nation[/i] through a network of hexes with symbols, Suburbia's abstractness came across similarly--I spent more time trying to coldly optimize/maximize/minimize hex placement, while the warm, fuzzy feeling of planning the overall aesthetics of city development (in fact, why SimCity was so much fun) went out the window. I may give it another shot, but it's very unlikely. It's not a bad game in terms of design, but it doesn't grab me. It's a "6".

Maybe my expectations were too high but I didn't see what the big thrill was all about. I loved SimCity just as much as the next 90's child but I felt a disconnect here. Not to mention the giveth/taketh mechanism annoyed me.

That said, I DO recommend this game although I can't compare to any other city-building game, because I'm still a noob to this whole tabletop experience. I might have just invalidated my own mini-review...

Really enjoy this.  My favourite tile laying game and better than Castles of Mad King Ludwig, at least with 2.  The gameplay is intuitive and satisfying.
3 plays in and I much prefer it to Mad King Ludwig.  The reputation and revenue scoring allow for engine-building and while not as fun as MKL, the mechanics are actually very thematic.

Update after 7 plays: I still love it BUT my husband does not like it.  First - some of the goal cards can work against your engine and you can actually get in a death spiral with negative income or reputation.  I like the balancing act this requires but my husband hates it.  I removed all goals that could be a problem (i.e. least of anything) but its still a no go.

Theme is family friendly and really shines through. Really feels like a town planner from the local council.

Game-play depth comes from the buildings (as they should) instead of a heavy ruleset (the rules are actually very simple). Scoring re-emphasizes the theme via rewarding logical placement and there is a huge variety of hidden goals to extend re-playability. Easy favourite.

Suburbia is my favorite game and is an absolute joy to play.  Every choice is difficult and meaningful and interesting. Public and private goals cause you to re-evaluate the value of specific tiles, and you have to constantly watch what the other players are doing.  I love this game!

I love playing this game, but there are several variables to balance, affected every time a new tile is placed into your tableau possibly by other tiles in your tableau--it is a lot to keep track of.

RATING: 9
Perfect combination of easy to teach and fun to play, with enough depth that I have yet to get bored of it after dozens of plays. That said, the options are fairly limited and easy to remember, so some of the gameplay has started to become mechanical amongst us that know the game best. The expansion would likely help with this should I ever get it.

RATING: 5
Clearly I am in the minority here, but the game is just a dud for me. I'm not sure the expansions do anything to make it better, either. The 5* one just added more tiles so some goals are terrible. It also added another upkeep step every round.

RATING: 7
An interesting tile layer with multiple interactions between the tiles. The theme works well here, you can almost imagine The Sims moving into your emerging suburb. Like Agricola it gets very calculational towards the end which is a bit of a downer, and the hidden goals do introduce an element of chaos that you can't counteract. Some of the tile powers can get a bit wild (Waterfront Realty, Casino, PR Firm), I don't suppose a lot of thought went into balancing the various combos. Like most emerging designers Ted Alspach has plundered other games (Through the Ages, Age of Steam) to get his mechanisms, but this was his best game at time of publication. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is the same game with better balance.

I like Suburbia a lot. Although the many combos can get a little fiddly, they're also a lot of what makes the game fun. I think the city-building theme is well-executed, and enjoy the game's sense of humor. The punishment mechanism is pretty harsh but also adds another wrinkle to the puzzle of the game.  Good stuff.

A fun city-builder. I enjoy the tile buying mechanic, but mainly enjoy putting my city together. Fitting the hexes together and maximizing my score has a very satisfying puzzle-y feel to it. I also tend to tell brief anecdotes about how the city and its culture formed, once the tiles start to fall in place.

Update 10/27/15: Dropping my score after more plays. Don't get me wrong, still a very good game, but it's really dried up for me over time. I've played several more tableau/light civ builder-type games since this one, and find I like others a bit better. On top of which, while "Suburbia" is quite good DESPITE being so bland, why, in this golden age, should we settle for something bland at all? In their review of the "Shogun" reprint, SU&SD said something along the lines of this: "in such a crowded and competitive landscape as today's games market, totally bland boring monochrome art design isn't ok anymore. You have to compete on all fronts." I think they're right. Is Suburbia still a decent game? Sure. Would I rather play this than, say, "Among the Stars" - or, for a more direct comparison, would I rather play this than "Castles of Mad King Ludwig"? Nope.

I like building games with exponential growth. The rules are simple and the tempo is fast. The game length is a little too long but still very acceptable. Despite the puzzle fun, manipulating the interactions between the tiles is still kind of annoying. I would rate it 8 if it can handle the tile effect more fluently.

My first few plays got some rules wrong, which lead me traded this game. After that I played some 2p games with the right rules with APP version, I wish I could get the game back and try more.

Excellent gateway game for getting friends into boardgaming.

Ruleset is light. 

Lots of counting and remembering to count tiles that are already in play.  My suggestion is to add the house rule - if you forget to count it, you don't score it.

After a couple of plays there is a feel that certain city builds will trump others.  (I will update this with more plays)

Sim-city themed tile laying/engine-building game. Mechanically it's a hex-based Glen More minus the rondel mechanic, plus extra options, and with slightly more straightforward scoring. Each hex can affect adjacent hexes, remote hexes and some are also affected by hexes in other players' boroughs. It comes with a lot of tiles and goals, so there's lots of replayability, the setup is fairly simple, and  every game feels a bit different. The theme is excellent, and it plays silkily.

The only complaints I've got is that the art is not my style, the boards are a bit sub-par (in particular the triangle that ostensibly holds all of the games' coins), and the insert is nonexistent. I'll almost certainly invest in an organizer.

The rulebook is short and sweet. Definitely easy enough to set up and teach during a game night. The tiles are a nice thickness, the colors are pleasing, and there are helpful aids, both in a guide for each player, and little hints built into the board (where your income and reputation markers start, how many tiles you use for different numbers of players, etc). The start player marker is delightfully over the top, a painted wooden rectangle that gets stickers on two sides. 

One of the things I noticed in researching the game, and saw even more in playing through it, is how the designer took care to have the tile placement be thematic. You don't want a factory next to the suburbs or a park. You don't want an airport in the center of town. You want a gas station and a school next to residential areas.

I foresee lots of replayability. Only about half of the tiles, and only a few bonus tiles, are used during a game. 

There's not much in the way of direct conflict. You can take or bury a tile you think your opponent wants, and you can benefit from tiles that your opponent builds, but you can't directly destroy anything on your opponent's board.

Has a bit of a Glen More feel to it, choosing tiles and watching what's adjacent to what, but it's also about money and population and not just tile placement.

This is a solidly designed game that carries its theme very well, but I just don't find it much fun to play. First, it's a spreadsheet-as-a-game and there's an awful lot of stuff to track. I think is thematic, since city planning involves number-crunching and is not thrill-a-minute. Second, I hate those red lines: I can swallow that they nicely abstract all the problems a growing suburb/city would face (and are not just a catch-up mechanism), they also kinda make it feel like you're just treading water the whole game. I do appreciate that they managed to incorporate some player interaction.

This is a charming game with solid thematic integration. You come out of the game with a cohesive, attractive city. I love the spatial element of planning what will go best next to each other, and I love the tiles chaining off of each other. The doubling tokens are also awesome, and clever use of those will be big. But for some reason the secret goals really rub me the wrong way. I think what bothers me most about them is that they're for majorities, so they're prone to people screwing them up for you. And this can go two ways: either they can try to suss out your goals and try to stop them, which is a mini-game I personally don't enjoy at all, or even worse your opponents just happen to buy things in a way that prevents you from scoring your goals. I haven't tried it without them but I suspect if we threw them out this would go up to 8.5 for me.

This is a game that ticks a lot of boxes, but unfortunately has some serious flaws: 

1) The game end condition is whenever the tile is drawn from the C stack, which means that the player who lucked into switching from income to vp at the right time will have an advantage.
2) The player whose private goal matches up with the public ones has a massive advantage. This can be a double edged sword though if you lose the public goal, you may lose your private goal too if someone else decides that that public goal is the one that they are definitely going to get.
3) It is possible for another player to stop you from getting your private goal accidentally if it aligns with their strategy (eg they have most greys, you have most contiguous greys, they just happen to put all their greys next to each other) or (non goal orientated: you have most lakes, another player might grab waterfront realty (before you or as well as you) and go lake mad)
4) The randomness of what tiles are available each turn, giving an advantage to whoever lucks into getting the strong income tiles early on
 
It's still a fun game now and again but can be incredibly frustrating if other players stop you from winning your goal by accident.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this game you purchase components for your growing city (buildings, parks, lakes, etc) that provide you with income and victory points and special bonuses.  There is a strong spatial aspect to the game as bonuses often depend on the arrangement of the tiles and what they are adjacent to.  There are also combo effects.  For example, tiles are categorized and many tiles will provide benefits depending on the categories of the tiles one already has (as in bonuses for residential tiles).  This is an engrossing game that is enjoyable.  What tempers my enthusiasm is that it is a very tactical game where you are to make the best choices each turn but while there are paths to victory there isn't a lot of strategic planning or interesting combos.  I leave the game feeling satisfied but not hungry to play again or with ideas I'd like to try out in a future game.

Suburbia is an enjoyable take on city-building. It has some issues in that there is quite a bit of bookkeeping, certain hidden goals can make the game harder for certain players, and that, with more players, the tiles can come out in an order that makes them near impossible for certain players to have a chance at obtaining them. In spite of those flaws, it still is quite a bit of fun if for no other reason that the feeling of building one's city and seeing it's economy, reputation, and population grow.

Reminds me of "Glen More" (2010) with that when you place a tile you also activate neighboring tiles.  The random goals for bonus points could add for replayability.

After subsequent plays I'm lowering my rating... too much to keep track of not only on your own play area but every one else's as well... the sequel to this one, Castles of Mad Ling Ludwig, is more streamlined version of this... and I would rather play than Suburbia (though I'm still more fond of Glen More)

Its a neat city building game with a cool catch-up mechanism.
I like that almost everything has a relevance with everything else.
Sadly there are too less different cards. Don't get me wrong it'*s enough variation, but I would have liked it more, if the cards with the same effects had different names and pictures on it, so it looks better at the end of the game. Instead of 3 industry it would be nicer if you had like "steel industry", "wood mill", "chemical industry" and so on.
Also the end of the game can hit you pretty surprisingly. You grew your income the whole game and at the moment you start going heavy into population, the last round begins... That kind of sucks.
Never the less it's a cool game! If you like euro-style city building games and you have no problem to lose the overview of the game, that's the game for you :)

I expected more from this game. It is gorgeous, the components are very well done and it has a lot of replayability, however the decisions involved in the game are rather obvious, so luck plays a huge role deciding if you get the right buildings at the right time. The first 30 minutes were pretty fun, however the game is too long for what it offers.

I´m not sure how I feel about the catching mechanism (red poles) in the score track, it seems it punish good players and allows a very similar score, still I have only played once so I´m, not sure this is the case. Also I´m worried about the Casino and PR tiles, they are (more or less) exempt from the balancing mechanism, making them overpowered.

The game is easy to learn and teach, but it is too light for my taste, I will give it another chance in the future to properly decide if I like it or not. For now it is out of my “to buy” list.

Suburbia is enjoyable for me despite being far lighter than my usual tastes.  Part of this is due to the city-building theme.  I've been a fan of city sims ever since SimCity 2000 for the PC.  I even like Urban Sprawl a great deal, despite the Chad Jensen title having been rejected by many for its computational complexity and chaos.

Suburbia itself is mechanically a simple tile-drafting game where the complexity comes from the tile interactions and the end-game goals.  I worry about players getting frozen out of income generators through little fault of their own though.  There's a significant snowball effect and getting left in the dust has proved fatal in my experience and those of my friends.

I can see wanting to bring this game out in a lot of 3-4 player situations where we have an hour.  Not sure I want to devote more than 10 plays to it, though.

- I wish they had chosen a better colour scheme for this game and made better artwork. Had FFG got hold of this, but kept all the mechanics the same, I feel it would be way more popular.
- I really enjoy the mechanics, but some of the buildings/tiles are pretty boring and drab.
- The way your per-turn income and scoring decreases as you reach scoring milestones is brilliant. This presents an interesting speed/timing decision. You generally want to build an income engine early game, and transition into a points engine mid-to-late game. The question is when to transition, and can you maintain enough income to ensure you don't stall when you jump up in points.
- The personal and public goals are also great. They give players just enough incentive to compete for things without massively punishing the players that choose to abstain. It's rare a player will be able to complete multiple public goals and their own private goal as these often go against each other. 
- I also really like the lake mechanism. We all take pleasuring in laking a tile another player clearly wants.
- Plays well with all player counts, teaching is pretty easy.
- Recommend the first expansion. The border tiles are a fun edition as they provide extra choices.

My local store will be getting reprints soon. I am going to watch this played out in game groups then decide whether it is a game for me. I am not too sure whether I like the Modern building games. I find older settings to be much nicer - they give warm feelings using woods, bricks, and stones to build. But it is still a building game so I am keeping this one in mind.

+ Had a chance to play this one with a nice group of 4. For first time playing, it was an OK game. Not too hard to understand, but many interactions from building tiles were a bit overwhelming at times. I think that this game would play much nicely with smaller group of people (2-3). The theme wasn't really there for me; simcity vibe was nice, but just putting tiles down didn't seem that satisfactory for me.

Fantastic game. Played the first three games incorrectly, activating a tile and all adjancent tile to it. Scores were in the 170s. After seeing the mistake in videos played game four correctly. Scored less then a 100 pts easily. Great game, concept. Will eventually get all the expansions.

I have played this a few time and I enjoyed it. I did feel as though I was understanding the game inside out after my 5th or 6th time of playing and lost some interest.  This is a fun game but I don't expect a deep or strategic challenge when I sit down to play... for me my expectations where too high and the game got a false start.... I'm giving it a little time and then I will revisit this one... it's potential isn't lost on my.

Sim City-type game in which you buy additions per turn to grow the population and, hopefully, income. What makes this game so wonderful is that you have to consider upcoming tiles and costs with each move, and what you place may boost the income of opponents as well as yourself. It's simple to learn, simple to play, offers tons of different strategies, with lots of options. Definitely worth a lot of replays.

Decent game play, shrouded in one of the more generic graphic designs I have seen in a while. This has a surprisingly decent solo game option, which I suspect enhances its appeal with the gamer crowd. In this game you simply place tiles which have their own effects as well as effects that apply depending on whether other tiles have been played and/or are adjacent. The catch-up mechanic not only slows the leader down, but forces all players to adjust their strategy based on what they are about lose by moving forward. Not terribly exciting, but easy to explain and just engaging enough.

This is a fun game where you feel like you are building a puzzle, but one in which placement of your tiles generates resources.

From the Spiel 2012 flood of city building games this seems to be the one coming closest to the ideal of a Sim City boardgame. In principle, it's a simple tile-laying game with no really original elements but the combination of economic management balanced with population growth works fine. Different goals and using only a subset of tiles each game guarantee replayability although I doubt that there are alternatives to the general strategy of first building up income and timing the switch from income generation to population growth correctly. A slight drawback is the fiddlyness of executing all effects from tile placement which can be too confusing for occasional gamers. Once these effects are internalized, it plays smoothly and is one of the few games that should finish in less time than the 90 minutes stated on the box. I'm interested in getting a copy which is high praise from me for a game involving combo building.

RATING: 7
This game is so much fun. Someone said this was like sim city in a box, which made me question how fiddly it would be. Once I saw the game in action, all of my doubts subsided. I love the way that strategies are varied without being overly complicated. While it's tough to remember to adjust your scores to tiles played by other players, I think that it keeps players engaged during downtime.

Update: has an excellent app for pass n play.  I loved it for the airport layover with my wife. There's a great single player there as we'll, though extra difficulty levels that you have to beat weren't the best. I also absolutely love the expansion suburbia inc. it fits seamlessly into the overall experience. Still loving it after loads of plays and looking forward to the other games coming out in the series.

RATING: 6
I would probably prefer the end game if it were more like Archipelago, with lesser bonuses going to 2nd, 3rd and so on for the various categories. Forty point swings in points that result from one person vs another being in the lead for a bonus are simply too large. Way too easy for small or unintentional moves at the end of the game to result in huge point swings. This falls squarely into the "I would never suggest to play it, but will be happy to go along if somebody is really excited to play it" category.

An absolute hit with my wife, mom/dad, and serious gamer group.  Light enough that casual gamers can get it, but with enough depth to appeal to the more serious gamer.  The expansions only help with that.  Takes the wonderful theme from SimCity and brings it to the tabletop in a very convincing and appealing way.  Players purchase city tiles from a market and build their city in a way that can trigger effects in other player cities to avoid the "multiplayer solitaire" criticism leveled at other, similar gamers.

I enjoy some games of multiplayer-solitaire such as this one. Interaction is minimal (similar to most worker placement games and deck-builders), which is a negative in my view, but somehow I walk away from this game (and pretty much all deck-builders) feeling like I built something cool. Prefer the Castles of MKL over Suburbia but suppose hard-core board-gamers (lolz) might swap that order around.

RATING: 7
Well placed themed in a very euro-lite game. The rules aren't complicated, but playing it can be a bit difficult. But the complicated nature of playing is also what makes this game so good. You need to pay attention to what everyone is building in their 'burbs. Because what someone else builds may increase your income, or change your reputation (Which causes people to move in or out of your city). You'll be placing buildings to try and balance income, and control your population growth.

The next interesting part of the game is the scoring/population track. The winner of the game essentially is the one with the largest population, but as you grow in population, the cost to run it increases and desirability of your city decreases. So you have to be set and prepared to gain points.

The city-building game that finally Got It Right.  Suburbia provides an excellent city building experience with well designed thematic connections - no one needs to ask why people don't want to move to the borough where there are landfills in everyone's back yard.  One of the brilliant decisions in the production of Suburbia is the plentiful oversupply of tiles - in most games, only about half the available tiles are in play, increasing variability and making you less sure of how you're going to proceed toward your goals.  This is the first game that's given me "SimCity in a box" - a definite 10.  Now maybe Ted Alspach can give me the occasional earthquake or monster attack :)

I like city planning/building as a theme in games. But the game is completely ruined by the Casino and PR Firm tiles, which are overpowered. Money is too free and the winner seems to be determined by who lucks out to be in the right position when these tiles are flipped.

This is a much lighter game than I expected. I also note that it never felt it being anything close to Simcity. It is however a pretty good game to play.

Players simply buy a tile every round and add it to their city (claiming either Income or Reputation). If players have not enough money, they flip a tile to "lake" it and gain some income.

That and some secret goals is pretty much it. Nothing particularly revolutionary about it, but its still fun to play.

Basic game play but complex interactions between properties.  Base game tile placement allows for enough flexibility in placement that there wasn't much decision making to be put into it.  The expansion may complicate that with the addition of the long boards.   

Have since upgraded the components so I have plastic mini hotels to put on properties that give future benefits as a way to simplify searching for effects after every tile is placed.

Oh, how I love this game! You have the joy of creation as you watch your corner of the city grow and evolve as you carefully shepherd it towards one or more of the end goals. I like the fact that there are limited ways to truly cripple your opponents. I'm rather bad at it and rarely win, yet still enjoy playing it every time. Also, the fun doesn't stop when the final scores are revealed- you then have the entertainment of looking at each other's towns and figuring out exactly where they have built. This is even better with the expansion.
The one niggle I have is the goals- a lot of them are "most X" or "least X" goals. If you're unfortunate enough to get a personal goal that is in direct conflict with one of the public goals then you can end up significantly disadvantaged. In addition, the "least" goals can really limit your options and lead to a rather crippled city. We tend to house-rule, removing 50% of the "least" goals before shuffling and drawing private and public goals, which really helps this problem. Other very minor niggle is that some of the cardboard components tore during punching, leaving them identifiable from the back. All this aside, an excellent game.

I strongly prefer games where you are playing other players, rather than multi-player solitaire. There are exceptions and this is one of them. One of the best. 

What I like most is how smooth the game plays and the interesting combinations you can develop. Every game I play results in a vastly different city. In this sense the game does involve a lot of indirect player interaction because you need to respond to what other players are taking from the real estate market and adjust based on that. You can't just follow your own plan, ignore what other players are doing, and expect to do well. However, the game still has a strong multi-player solitaire feel about it and that's my only negative about the game. It's fast, fun, clever, and by the end, satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game that I always enjoy playing and introducing to others.  The goals provide you with some long term planning potential, while reacting to the changing real estate market and your opponents' moves is primarily tactical.  I like how the complexity is emergent from the tile interactions rather than a heavy rule set.  A lot of replayability in the box from the different goals, and the fact that not every tile is used in each game.  I also appreciate the modular board/setup that can easily accommodate different table sizes and player counts.

Some people may not like that there is no way to track different tile interactions (other than mentally), so for example you may forget you get a certain bonus when someone plays a type of tile, but I have not found this to be too much of an issue, it just necessitates paying attention to other players' moves.  Also, a small minority of the tiles might be considered duds that are hardly ever bought (I have yet to play a game where somebody purchased the new car dealership), but this is a minor quibble.

All in all a great design, and one of my favorite middle weight euros.

2014-09-29 - I finally played again, with Suburbia INC expansion and the game is really good. Back to 8.

2017-10-27 - 8->6 - After almost 3 years later (and many, many more games I got to know) I played Suburbia again and I find it to be OK. When I played Castles of Mad King Ludwig I was sure that I like Suburbia better. Now I really don't know. And I guess I won't suggest playing Suburbia although I will play it if anyone would like to.

RATING: 2
The first time I played this it was alright. I wasn't jumping for joy with each move, but all in all, not bad.

The second time I played this, it was terrible. The tiles in the starting market were all WAY too expensive for the amount of starting money we got. There was only one affordable one, and since my opponent was start player, it was gone before I ever got a turn. From the starting move on, I was unable to afford anything that generated recurring funds. I had to turn buildings into lakes the whole game, and then immediately get the meager amount of money that this made for me taxed away for the sin of progressing on the population track.

I'm okay with losing a game. But to have fun, I need to have the feeling that I can use my ideas to make some kind of self-determinative progress. The rules for Suburbia seem to be written so that if you have a poor hand (or a poor place in line at an ill-stocked market) from the beginning, then you're basically screwed. You now have to sit there for the next hour going through the motions so that the other players can take their turns. That doesn't seem like a well-thought-out design. Even if someone could guarantee that this would never happen to me again, I just don't want to play a game where it can happen to ANYONE. Games should be for having fun—for ALL the players to enjoy themselves trying different tacks even if an initial poor decision or poor hand means they won't actually win the game.

Suburbia just doesn't fit the bill.

If you want to build futuristic cities, play [thing=128271][/thing]. Heck, even [thing=25568][/thing] is a better city-building game better than this, and it's an abstract. You want markets? Play [thing=2651][/thing]. Don't play Suburbia.

City-building game where the tiles play off of one another, so clever combos can be accomplished for maximum points.  There is a neat bidding mechanism to make players pay a premium for tiles they REALLY want if they aren't available for a cheaper price.  It's a balancing act.  I was entertained, but it isn't my style, so I would never buy this one.

This game is tough, on the one hand it works really well, lots of depth, and tons of enjoyment to be had.  On the other, it sometimes feels like work, and also the production quality has left something to be desired.

Starting with the good.  The game's design if very good.  I don't own another tile laying game, and this one has a lot of very good mechanics behind it.  We play power grid, and the new tiles follow sort of a "market" value for new tiles.  Unlike most games, the highest spot actually has a chance of being purchased.  You can strategically gain a lot by buying an overpriced tile.  This is all new to me and a welcomed change.

The other nice thing is the fact that you have indirect influence over the other players from their tiles, your tiles, or goals.  Manipulating the market to force others to spend a ton of money, or taking less than optimal tiles are some examples.  Leaving high cost tiles in the lowest market value blockading low income players from making big moves are just great.  Dumping off certain tiles to force others to take a certain type of tile (Industry / Commercial / Residential) so they'll lose the goals for points at the end game are so nicely done.

All the while you're going to have to watch what you're building because a wrong tile can give benefit to your opponent instead of yourself.  Or you might have the right tile but no where to put it.  You have to watch the market to make sure a tile you want stays on the board by the next turn, and also keep your balance up so you can build up your own combos.

The game is pretty solid as far as risk / reward goes too.  Is it better to put your eggs in one basket and go with an airport route early?  The tiles early on provide very little bonus, but as the game goes on, others can benefit off your early plans.  However, if you can secure all of them and multiple tiles comes out per phase, you're in a great spot to win the game.

My wife actually played this game and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I have yet to play with more groups, but she's asking for more.  I've played a single player game, and three, three player games.  I think from the positives alone, I can give this game a solid 8.  I like it a bit more because it seems to draw itself out for more plays.  Popularity helps with the score.

Now, not everything is sunshine and rainbows.  When I first saw the reviews of this game, I knew calculating the scores can be daunting.  It can actually go both ways with that.  I first tried the solo game and it was a lot to take in at once.  Despite only having a single city to concentrate on, it had a lot of back and fourth with the scoring.  You had to calculate what is happening, what has happened, all while learning the tiles.  My first play was a total bust and I had to restart mid way.  My 2nd game ended with more understanding but it took nearly 2 hours for me to go through it going back to the rules as I played.  I would strongly suggest playing multiplayer first before tackling a solo game.

Now, the next three plays I played was three players.  As each player keeps an eye out on their own tiles, scoring is a LOT easier.  Less planning ahead because you don't have the extra step in solo rules, and you can plan while you wait.  Actually that's one positive I left out.  Productive downtime is a very common thing in this game.  Still, as the game played on, and by time our third game drawn out, people got lazy, attention spans start to grow short and I had to now keep an eye out on three sets of tiles for everyone.  Forgetting to score things started to creep up, and it became a small bit of chore to continue the game.

Now, if you're playing with people who are all into the game, I don't think this will be a problem.  So I took a point off purely for the fact that you can hit or miss with the scoring.  I know with more plays it will get easier, but I see it as a problem in the future after a bit of time off from the game that relearning the tiles will be a bit tricky again.

Lastly, I'm not exactly thrilled with the many comments about the quality of the production.  My copy came with a couple of tear edges on tiles.  The tile cut out was of very bad quality.  It's definitely the worst production of all the games I've owned (only after my King of Tokyo copy), I have yet to follow up with the company to receive replacements on my tiles, but the saving grace is, it is still a playable game with the damages.  Unfortunately, I keep my items in pristine condition and to me, this poor quality is unacceptable.  I won't take points off for this however, because I focus more on game play experience.  Otherwise I think the poor quality would drive this otherwise great game into maybe a 5 - 7 rating.

Still, I think I'm glad to have this in my collection, and will be playing this many more times in the years to come.

I seem to be -very- good at making money at this game. Unfortunately, the goal is to make victory points by driving people into your city through reputation. And I am -terrible- at this. 

I like this game, it has a lot of fun mechanics and options to deny runaway leaders to counter its luck-draw component. The end game bit is terrible though, and I think I'd like playing just until the stack is down to a determined level rather than a random draw one.

Also feel I got tired of playing this super quick...

For some reason my taste just doesn't align with a lot of Bezier games. I find the theme and ideas of this game intriguing and I think it's a good design but the scoring is too fiddly and (as in Mad King Ludwig) I just don't find the market fun. Kind of exhausting to play.

The Good: A game with varying strategies to try. The rules, for the most part, can be taught as the game proceeds.

2. central targets for everyone

Tetszett, kimondottan érdekes volt még a Mad King Ludwig után is. Sokkal gémerebbnek érzem a Suburbiát, nagyobb figyelmet, több adminisztrációt igényel. A dizájn itt sem díjnyertes, de megértem, hogy funkcionálisnak kell lennie. Játék közben teljesen rendben van, csak amikor ráér az ember kicsit nézegetni, akkor morfondírozik el rajta, hogy vajon nem lehetett volna szebbre?
Azt hiszem, hogy pont a könnyedsége és a kevésbé adminisztratív jellege miatt tetszik jobban a Ludwig, de ha nagyon bele lennék bolondulva az ilyen jellegű építgetősdibe, akkor valószínűleg a Suburbia lenne a nyerő.

Similar to Castles of Mad King Ludwig, but with more player interaction and a theme that ties it all together much better. Definitely more strategic than Castles. However some tiles definitely feel overpowered, especially in a two player game. This can lead to frustrating playthroughs. But overall a good game, and is good with two players without any "Take That!" mechanics. Not sure how it scales to higher player counts.

Enjoy the challenge of balancing income vs reputation, and creating my city.  The hexagonal tiles create a fab tile laying puzzle.

Too many scoring events. "You placed a Zoo? I get 2 points from my Civic Arena, which is doubled by my Parking Lot..." Everyone needs to pay attention to everyone else's turn, which for what is other 4 player solitaire, makes this more bookkeeping than fun. Still, some great ideas...

Wow, this is a good game. The game turn is really simple, Take a tile, Place a tile, score. Tile interactions are crazy and you really have to pay attention to everyone's turns since there new tiles can affect your town. Everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it. For a game with simple turns there are many choices to make. Only issue, remembering to score everything when it may affect other players and adjacent tiles is hard. People with constantly need to adjust stuff as they missed one of the tiles.

A city building, tile-laying game that has slightly more theme than I would expect given the drab art style of the game. The theme is showcased in the constraints of building a city too quickly, and not having it adequately planned. Couple that with the good chuckles as you assemble a disaster of a city, with multiples of certain buildings that would be unnecessary in a real city. The bonuses give the player a good direction. I still rate this a 7, even though I'd always prefer to play Castles of Mad King Ludwig over this if there was ever a choice between the two of them.

This is an outstanding board game. I bought this thinking it would be a nice little game for two people, but I was very, very wrong. This is a great strategy/(IMO)casual game to play on any weeknight. It is competitive, but not too competitive to put you on edge. The entire game I feel like I'm going to lose, right up until the secret and public objectives get counted for. Up until this happens, depending on the strategy I take, I may be pleading with the game for that last round tile to come out or vice versa. This game is designed wonderfully. The only downside to this game that I see is the sheer amount of information you're managing while playing it. (However, this could be looked at as a feature of the game) Sometimes it gets a little overwhelming with just three or four players when you have to do all of the checks for a tile you place down(this can even lead to forgetting to do something). Nonetheless, to me, Suburbia is a must own board game and is a great casual/strategic game.

[size=12][b]Why I like Suburbia:[/b][/size]
+ The various tile interactions are fairly balanced. 
+ I like the mechanics
+ I like the theme
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The duration of the game is fine
+ There seems to be high replayability with the Suburbia Inc expansion (that I have yet to play with)
+ The game requires meaningful decisions to win
+ There is the right amount of decisions

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Suburbia:[/b][/size]
/ The game is missing an extension to the board. You can find this file on BGG.
/ There are a lot of things to keep track of throughout the game. Some players for some reason fail to read the player aid and I find myself repeating the process too many times or doing the process for the player. I suggest playing with people who are willing to read the player aid. 
/ Money seems to be a non-issue. I wish money was tighter so that player order is not as much of an issue in regards to buying the strong tiles that come out at the end of the cue. I think that a variant that increases the cost of the final spot would fix this issue but I have yet to implement this.

I wonder if Suburbia was playtested as an app, because all the record keeping takes more time than actually playing the game. 

Apart from the never ending record keeping Suburbia's biggest fault is that it's super dry with almost no interaction. Gameplay-wise it also offers zero new ideas. Art is functional but ridiculously bland. 

Currently one of the (if not the) most over rated game on BGG.

Ted Alspach made a lot of dofferent games and proves with this one that he is amongst the hest designers.

Thanks to a well thought of cost tracking system he managed to make an interesting citybuilding game that plays rather quickly.

He confirmed his place amongst the best designers by making castles of Mad king ludwig.

I am eagerly awaiting his take on a pure economic game.

RATING: 7.7
This is the board game version of Sim City. The game mechanism faithfully reflects the city building theme. Although the tiles look boring, most of them do make thematic sense. I also like that there are common goals AND a personal goal, secretly chosen out of the two given at the beginning. Those goals offer a fair amount of variety. Otherwise, every game would be quite similarly scripted. What I mildly dislike is that one has to keep checking all the previously played tiles, including other players', since all of them affect and are affected by the new tile. I know it is an essential aspect of the game, but it requires unusual scrupulousness.

There is a trivial amount of interaction, and that seems to make this a shallow game of drafting the best thing you can afford while you put together the pieces of your tableau/city area.

Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).

During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost – and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!

Can't wait to try with the expansion. Also need to check out Castles of Mad King Ludwig as I've heard it's similar.

RATING: 6.5
December 2013 - Debut ranking is an 8. Highly entertaining and enjoyable after 6 plays. Very smooth and intuitive, easy to teach.

January 2014 - Two-player play is seeming highly predictable after a few more plays. In danger of slipping to a 7.

2014: slips to a 7 because the two-player play is just predictable; my brother has found the same to be true in 3/4p play as well. Once you know the tiles, there's almost no game to be had here anymore :(.

Played 3 times, 4p.  Very good city building game.  In the beginning, as with most economic vs. victory point games, the economic engine is most important.  It seems that this game, with its giant stack of goals (that are both hidden and public) will have quite a bit of replay-ability.

Fairly fast game of build & operate your engine (city) for resources and points.  The income / population grown mechanic (of passing the red bars) is a bit tedious and not elegant but it works.  Building the city and configuring hex tiles is fun and satisfying.  On the flip side, it's easy to forget things and skip on points & penalties because of all the cross tile interactions (even across players).  The playability & relatively quick play makes this worthwhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Curious to keep exploring this one.  This game likely requires several plays just to learn the tiles so people can start planning ahead in the midst of playing tactically as well.  Balancing money and reputation is important and one does want to not build up population too quickly at the expense of loss of income.  This feels like one of the better city building games out there and I am curious to see what different paths to victory exist and how much interplay exists between the different tiles.  The game is a bit fiddly in that you have be paying attention to update your income, reputation, and population as tiles do interact with each other and effect those numbers.

Eines meiner Lieblingsspiele... was soll ich sagen? :)
Wenn man das Spiel kennt, hat man schon Vorteile gegenüber einem, der die Plättchen nicht kennt und nicht weiss was da noch kommen kann.
Wer an der Reihe ist, darf sich von den ausliegenden Plättchen eines aussuchen und in seine Vorortsiedliung einbauen. Das kostet Geld und bringt Einkommen oder Ruhm. Je nachdem wo das Plättchen hingelegt wird gibt es Synergie-Effekte. Wohn und Gewerbegebiete neben einen Park bringt Ruhm, was wiederrum Einwohner beschert (Siegpunkte). Industrie zerstört zwar mein Ansehen, vor allem wenn man sie neben die Wohnsiedliung baut, aber erhöht mein Einkommen, was mir Geld bringt um neue Plättchen kaufen zu können. Dieser Sinn dahinter, dass sich die Plättchen sinnhaft gegenseitig beeinflussen finde ich an dem Spiel so toll.
Ich spiele es immer wieder gerne ;)

It's pretty fun building up your city. It sucks to have other players turn your awesome tiles into lakes before you can snatch them up, but that doesn't seem to happen too often. It's hard to judge which strategy will be the best, as so many of the tiles are absent each game. Still, when you embark on a strategy and it comes together, it's a beautiful thing!

RATING: 7
Another city-building game, this one didn't skimp on the theme (though we did end up building a city in which one could go to elementary school and college, but all the high schools were at the bottom of lakes). The game isn't bad, but very mathy. Every tile placement requires you to see what that tile scores. Then see if it changes the score of any tiles next to it. Then see if it changes any of your other tiles. Then see if it changes anyone else's tiles. Then go to suburbia.com to see if it changes the tiles in any other games of Suburbia currently being played in the world. Okay, that last one is a lie, but still there's a lot of calculation and recalculation. None of it is difficult, but it does increase the chances of discovering at some point that you shorted yourself some income or something. This one's supposedly coming out on the iPad soon and I think it's probably better suited for that.

In addition, the goals you're trying to achieve are hugely swingy and it's possibly to be dealt a personal goal that isn't worth much even if you do achieve it. But that's something that repeated plays might reveal to be not much of a problem.

Hugely enjoyable.  Once the rhythm of the game is understood it moves smoothly but has enough decisions to make you think and keep your attention throughout (our game played between 75-90 minutes but I am confident we could hit the 1 hour mark with more play).  The choosing of the tiles means you are primarily playing against to the left and right of you however the common goals and tiles which trigger scoring opportunities across the table mean everyone around the table is involved and attention should be paid to all choices.

The designer's connections to Age of Steam is evident at a surface level with some scoreboard features and tiles.  However, more importantly the similarity is apparent in how strongly the mechanics support the theme and the need for a 360 view as each aspect has an impact on the other. Entirely engrossing.

A refreshing contrast to a plethora of kickstarter dice fuelled games I have faced recently. A welcome change.

Tile laying game with a fairly sophisticated engine under the hood. Thought about getting it at Essen 2014, but was low on funds - then I got it cheaply through a friend. So far I prefer playing with just the base game, to get a better grip on the possible combos. Witg both 5* and inc. There was simply too much giong on, and too many different combos, that you couldn’t really have any adea if they would be i. The mix or not

I like this game a lot. The shared goals become kind of interesting races to see what your opponents are going for. And your secret goal can either be something you really work towards or you can just ignore goals and try and get the best score otherwise.

The reputation and income tracks bring the theme into the game. And I think the simplistic art style works for this game.

Good game, original, and with some depth. 
If you love city building, it's the game for you. It's a thinking game, but not too long, a perfect mix for most gamers.
There is some luck involved, and some strategies that are better than others, so the negative of this game is that you might end up losing without being able to do much about it (due to bad luck).
Thankfully, it doesn't happen too often.

RATING: 8
While my initial fears that it is really easy to forget of effects that proc off nonadjacent tiles, this game has also fulfilled my expectations of a game that combines simplicity with a high number of choices and good theme implementation (despite the only okay art scheme). Furthermore, this game is very easy to learn (only 3 pages of rules if you exclude the solo variant) and seems to incentivize different play styles depending on which goals are available. 

Knowing what to maximize your limited money in the early game and when to switch from boosting income to boosting reputation in the midgame is key, and if you can pull ahead casino and PR firm seem very strong (but doing so too soon will leave you floundering late game). 

This game has no direct interaction, but you can definitely deny people some key tiles. Because of this, I think this game plays best with 3, as with 4 it is much harder to pull off strong synergies (however it still plays well with 4), and 2 does not offer as much competition for goals.

A seemingly simple and attractive tile laying game, which really sucks you in and can actually be quite punishing if you make the wrong choices. A little luck on which tiles come up, but managing your money should reduce this. I really liked it and want to play it again. Bought at Essen 2013.

Excelent game!
It doesn't play for too long (1h, 1h:30m), has a good amount of strategy, and, still, doesn't get you brain burned by playing it.
Filled with good choices every round, so you can adapt your strategy as the game evolves, and also has 'final goals' that improove the player interaction and the thrill at the game ending. 
I have never met anyone who disliked it and it seems that I'll never get tired of playing it, very well made. First game that I also enjoyed playing solo, in the 1p mode.

It's SimCity in board form!

The big swing point to be aware of is the presence of the Casino and PR Firm buildings in Phase 3. They're the ones that let you ignore the diminishing returns of income and reputation as your population rises, and can easily be the most powerful buildings in the game. If some players aren't aware of them, and aren't thinking about holding enough cash to grab them at first opportunity, the knowledge gap can effectively determine the game with a missed opportunity to buy them.

12/27/17: 8, after one two-player game. Interesting decisions to be made each turn. As the game goes on, there gets to be a lot to keep track of, but it wasn't too much. (We never actually forgot anything.) Maybe it will become easier to track with more experience? Or maybe it could help to place special tokens on the trickier ones to track, as a reminder?
12/31/2017: 9, after a four-player game. Liked it even more. More tile variety, and more interesting interactions across buroughs. Tracking didn't seem like too much trouble, so I don't think any sort of additional token is needed. The game did take longer - a bit over 2 hours - but I think that will go down with experience.

Suburbia is a solid attempts at a city building game.  The game has you buy hex tiles and you place them with other tiles.  Certain tiles will have benefits if placed next to other tiles.  Also, it can have benefits if other players use certain types of tiles.  You have secret objectives in the game and public objectives.  These objectives can represent a very large percentage of overall game scoring can be very "swingy".  The game suffers from having to constantly remember that certain tiles have benefits when other tiles, including opponent tiles are placed.  Even with all of this, it is still an pretty fair game.

SimCity meets Carcassonne.  All the upkeeping makes you wish the computer was doing the work.  If it wasn't so fiddly, it would be a fun light tile-laying game with a bit of an economic engine.  

I would only play with 2 or 3.  4 seems like it would be a real headache to keep track of everything.

A game of finding the right combinations to make your little city work and complete your goals with a puzzle element in the tile placement. Keep an eye on your economy and don't forget that the bigger your city gets the more expensive and crowded it becomes.

I still enjoy this game but it has been downgraded somewhat after a few plays. The game seems to be mostly driven by the order of the tiles that come out, and the vast differences in the difficulties of the goals. Some goals such as "all other players use doubler markers" are pretty much a given while others such as "Most Airports" may suffer by having only one or two or even no airports appearing in the game at all.

Really neat city builder that is maybe not the deepest game out there but can be learned in just a couple of minutes and remains challenging and interesting because of the changing goals. The interaction between tiles is the best part of the game: seeing how large parts of your city interact with each other and with cities of opponents is extremely fun and satisfying.
The only part about the game that feels odd is the ending: I would have preferred a more Carcassonne-like end scoring of some sorts that makes the final scoring a bit more tense. Now the game ends kind of abruptly.

I love that someone has finally made what amounts to a board game adaptation of SimCity. Unfortunately, I wasn't as smitten with this as I hoped I'd be. It doesn't help that I find Ted Alspach's art style off-putting, but the real problem for me was that the game seemed to inconsistently alternate between tiles that have a once-off effect, tiles that do something based on the neighbouring tiles, and tiles that use the whole game state. The latter were problematic in that at times it seemed I needed to keep track of the game state at all times. Computer games can do this, but board games shouldn't.

I'd be happy to give this game a few more goes if it was suggested, but I can't see myself adding it to my collection.

A pretty standard city/tableau building game but the really interesting mechanic for me is the score track and the balancing that it does with the score/income/reputation.

was always a fan of city building games on Pc (sim city etc) this tile laying / buying game is very enjoyable, each player tries to build the best suburb of a city, game has open and secret objectives.

played a 4-player game and no expansions
good game, good mechanics, good components in look and use.  The tiles may make a new player leery but the rules and the tiles are easy to read and correctly understand.  3/4 of the players were brand new and the teacher having only one game under his belt and we still didn't check the rules much.
It may feel like a point salad occasionally.  This especially stung me because I lost by having the goal I had worth 10 and the person that beat me his goal was worth 15.

on kinda a side note, this game is a great example of having a tracker.  Some games need them and don't have them, others use them when its not needed, this game needs two and has two.  This game makes me respect trackers being used for not super heavy games.  And it blends in the tracker so their not just hanging out on the side.

I’m in a minority when it comes to this game, obviously, as most folks seem to love it. To a certain extent, I can understand their stance, since building up your little city in an optimal way, making the best use of the tiles on offer, is certainly fun. And while the various tile interactions are possibly more involved than they have to be, I would gladly swallow the extra book-keeping, since you get back both an enlarged decision space and a small taste of the complexity that a proper city represents.

Regretfully, Suburbia throws all this into the bin with the lazy (and frankly, a bit baffling) design choice of using all-or-nothing goals in what purports to be a mid length strategy game. That some of these goals are hidden, giving you the opportunity to screw over another player accidentally, just adds insult to injury. For me, this turns a promising and well-developed game structure into an overlong luckfest.

I’m prepared to make an exception for the two-player game, because a lot of what irks me about the arbitrary nature of the goals will be less of a problem there – at least you clearly know who to target with counterplans. With more players, however, this is not something I’m keen on playing again.

Gives you the feeling of building a city, but with more of a bird's eye view so you're not bogged down with all of the minutiae.   That makes it a tad bit lighter than you would expect from a city building game, but there are still decisions to be made - variable goals, tile placement, keeping money/reputation in check, synergies between tiles, etc.

RATING: 7
Satisfying city-builder that fired Castles of Mad King Ludwig. The options are immense and offer a multitude of different paths to victory, ensuring no two games will play out the same. Tiles are easy to understand and finding quality combinations is fun and intuitive.

It does have some down sides. Keeping score gets tricky as your city grows and the score track can be a bear to manage, but it doesn't get in the way of the game's execution.

Good "euro" game with a well implemented thematic. I really like the idea of creating a small city and make it profitable while trying to keep a good reputation.

In our first run it seems that maybe there's a little to much "fiddlyness" involved at keeping all the tiles effects in play, but I liked the game a lot, and my group said that they will play it again (I hope they mean it).

This very well might go up. Only played 2p so far (barring a 5-turn, early-ended game with 3). So far I find it to be amazing - building upon Castles of Burgundy and Among the Stars, this offers a lot of depth and surprising interaction. I'm raring to play this more.

RATING: 9
What a smartly designed game. So simple: buy a tile, lay a tile, collect income.
I am normally not fond on tile-laying games, because there is not much strategy in them. But this game is different in that perspective.
There are initial goals - hidden and open, for which players are competing. Furthermore, all tiles interact, on different levels and with different aspects, which introduces new (sub)goals.
The consequence is that each player desires almost every tile, but for a different reason. There are many paths to victory, but all go through the same set of ever contested tiles.

Suburbia is a game great in mechanics and filled with theme. Each turn is simple, with the player playing 1 out of 2 possible actions. However, the repercussions affect the player until the end of the game (like throwing a rock into a lake and seeing the ripples form, except the ripples become bigger as time passes). This creates different strategies for different gamers. Never once did I feel I could not do anything on my turn. There's always something good out of everything you do. The difference between a good and a great players is the ability to plan ahead. Still, there are goals that can balance the game so that losing players always have a chance to win. This, for me, is a great game that's easy to learn, but hard to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the things I love in games is simple rules with a lot of strategy. I think Suburbia fits that. 

The other qualities about it that make it special are how unique each city builds. You can almost tell a story about your city by the end. The combination of public and private goals makes the end game sing.

(Also own Suburbia Inc and Suburbia 5*.)

The more I play this game the more fascinated I become. It is elegant and messy if that is possible. I would say this is a medium light board game once you have a handle on the rules. I really enjoy this as a two player, the interaction is great, stopping your opponent from getting what they want. It also limits the amount of upkeep with the checking of all the tiles, that can get busy in a 4 player game.

I love this game.  It was one that I missed when it first came out, but when the buzz finally reached me I knew it was a game I was going to enjoy.

My only gripe, and its a minor one, is that I wish there was more variety in the tiles.  Sometimes we'll be playing and there will be 4 airports for purchase or something along those lines.  More variety would have knocked this one out of the park for me.

All the same, I really enjoy this one!

Reminds me a bit of Simcity, with different types of tyles.

For a city builder there is some interaction more than just stopping others getting a certain tile which is a positive.

Expansions add to the enjoyment after you have played a while and the modular way they work allows you to tailor to your groups preferences.  There is however plenty in the base game to get your moneys worth.

Less convniced with 5* and certainly wouldnt recomend as a 5 player game as feel would go to long.

Good game that is fun to play but after 10 or so plays it becomes 'same-y'. There is not a huger variety in the tiles and the goals don't really shake up the game play that much. The best winning strategy is usually to try and prevent the others players from reaching there goals which after a few plays become evident. 

I suggest picking it if you find it for a good price.

Suburbia is a tough nut to crack. I definitely enjoyed it, but we had trouble getting going. The directions, in my opinion, are not well articulated and not comprehensive. As a result, some of the placement rules are unclear at first, particularly tiles with ongoing effects. Our first game was a write off. At the beginning of the second game, we were still checking the rules (in vain) for clarification. Don't get me wrong. The game is not that complicated. But there are some important distinctions that have to be made between their effects. So, the rules get a C-. The game itself though is fun and quite different. It is a thinky game, not an "exciting" game necessarily, but there is a unique satisfaction to building your own city. I like it, and I hope that I grow to like it more with future plays.

RATING: 8
This game simulates planning and building rival cities and competing for various resources.  Each turn a player adds one tile to their growing city, and then adjusts their population and money accordingly.

The designers here guaranteed a different experience every time by including more tiles than needed (so you only play with a subset), and introducing various public and private goals to compete for throughout the game.  One game I double-invested in Casinos, while another I never saw a single one.  This little bit of unknown information really goes a long way here: are Offices in short supply this time?  Are we all avoiding Industrial Districts like the plague?  Tune in next time to find out!

From the actual playing stand point, the turns are short and simple, with only two resources to really track (income and population).  I was not expecting to like such a simple design, but I love it.  Rather than focus exclusively on getting those two numbers very high, you're usually focused on combining adjacency bonuses on your city tiles.  Two players may have rich towns but accomplish that in completely different ways.

It's quite fun solo, although working out all the changes each time you lay a tile is annoying. Multi-player it remains annoying but adds dry and tedious to the experience too.

Good city builder, maybe the best.  However it can be very mathy and you have to take things slow to make sure everything gets scored correctly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.99
The solo variants are essentially there to help teach you the game. The solo variant without the bot has zero tension and it is merely you trying to score as many points as possible without any boost from another player. The bot is very easy to beat. They generate a ton of money so that's the only thing you really need to worry about. You can intentionally screw over the bot.

Multiplayer is really the only way to play this game. I have yet to do four player though even though it is suppose to play best at that number. Four players will make the amount of turnover for the tiles to be on the high side so it could make it harder for players to plan out better. More players means more ties for goals. This in a way can free up strategy as you might not get the chance to win certain goal rewards anyway.

There's extra stuff to keep track of due to all of the bonuses with the interconnecting suburban areas. That aspect might be the thing that takes to down a notch from being a gateway, but I have had little issue with it. The rulebook is four pages, and the theme is so well done it is easy for people to pick up outside of tracking bonuses

Explaining a couple of the the goal tiles in the rulebook would have been nice. The fewest/lowest goals can be annoying for some and can honestly make the game more difficult to win even with higher rewards. Some combos are more difficult to pull off than others, IE office titles, but some of them are done for thematic reasons.

Currently my #3 game. rating wise it is tied with others but wins out due to plays and total time invested.
 
Rating Potential: 8-9. Someday I'll try to figure out if it deserves the full 9+ or not. It would make it close enough to a 10 to where I would wonder why it isn't. I'm just not sure I'm ready to put it on the level of Mage Knight and Summoner Wars. Hearing the expansion was built along with the base game confirms that this wasn't as much of a full blown game that it could have been, and if everything was there from the start, it would be an instant 10. It is still "kind of" awesome though.

I really like this, but its just begging for expansions.

Edit:  After a couple of more plays, I'm lowering my score.  The public and secret bonuses scored at the end of the game can cause way too much swing if you happen to be the unlucky one who draws two private bonuses which conflict with the public ones.  This is a very poor design, imo.

Also, I cannot agree with those who claim this game is best played with four.  I find to be unacceptable with four due to the issue with the bonuses, which is mitigated by having fewer players.  Two works best for me.

An excellent game.  My son also enjoys it, which says a lot as he generally does not like most board games.

Fairly easy rules (although sometimes there is a lot to keep up with when it comes to scoring and tile bonuses).  The game has a great graphic design and is aesthetically pleasing.  At the end of the game I enjoy looking at the city I have built.

Theme is the most important aspect for me in a game, and I was originally unsure how I'd feel about Suburbia.  I want to make sure when I build my city everything fits and makes sense; not just putting tiles down for the sake of getting points.  I am happy to say that Suburbia manages the theme quite well.  You don't want factories next to residential areas, you get more people when you have schools, and you make people happy by building parks (which cost money to upkeep),etc.  

There isn't a whole lot of player interaction, but there can be, depending how you want to play.  I was a big fan of SimCity growing up, and this gives me that feeling again.  Out of all the city building board games out there that I've seen, Suburbia looks the best, to me at least; aesthetics are important in a city building game, such as this, as you want your city to look like a city.

Great game when played with 3 players.  The only thing I would do differently is eliminate the hidden goal tiles.  Although you get to choose from two, there is still too much variability in their difficulty to attain.  I think the game would be much better with all information public.  As is, I rate the 3-player game a solid 9.

With 4 players, the game begins to fall apart a bit, or maybe it just plays differently and I don't like it as much.  There are not enough rounds and the bonus tiles completely overwhelm the importance of points earned during the game.  I would prefer to play with 3 public goal tiles rather than 4 public goals and 1 private goal.  As is, I give it a 7 with 4 players.

RATING: 3
10/05/13 Played a three-player game. 
I thought the game all made sense, that placing certain tiles adjacent to other tiles could increase or decrease one's income and reputation. But the process of trying to figure out which tile to buy to optimize your community, where exactly to place it, and exactly how it would affect you (and others) was tedious. Ditto the "red lines" on the scoretrack every five spaces or so that basically kicked you for increasing your score (population). All this basically sucked the fun out of the game. I'd rather do my taxes. 
I could go on and on about what a train wreck this game is, but several people who rated the game a "1" or a "2" have already expressed exactly how I felt and were much more eloquent about it. Please see their comments.

Initial rating.  Enjoyed it enough to try it again.  Not sure if it is just a good game or if it is a very good game.

Second play was very frustrating. Seemed like tile draw was killer, but maybe I just had really bad planning?  Not sure, but I lowered my rating.

But, it might have just been frustrating because I played it poorly.  :)  I should try this one again.

3rd time the tiles were kind.

This is an enjoyable game if one accepts the fact that the tile appearance coupled with one's hidden goal can really swing one's fortunes.

Yawn... Now this game is fine, perfectly fine, slick modern clear graphics and clean intuitive gameplay (for the most part).

However, it's just an exercise in snowballing and growth, so much growth. As such, it is only worthwhile to play alone against AIs on your tablet - when you have nothing else to do... I will say that the "gates" that have you lose income makes for a nice challenge, and setting up your city to get the most advantage when you change gears from income to pop / rep is a tricky puzzle. 

Also, the triggers that has you looking over at your opponents cities are more clunky than rewarding from an interaction standpoint and I almost wish they just cut it altogether so that the only screwage would be "Damn! you took my tile!"

Playable, amusing enough, but just a bit meh...

The game had a funny twist in its population count which affected income and reputation. The pile placement lacked of twists or arcs however. There were no "rewards" for good planning in the last C-pile. I feel this is a great base, but could have been better. Could be solved with carefully thought-out extensions, maybe?

Rating after 2 4-player games. My favourite of the city building genre. Play is straight forward, although some fiddliness due to the tile interactions. Good length for complexity. Edit: Played many games on Ipad now - it may be a better game there than in physical form, like Elder Sign.

Interesting city building. Not a big interaction, but an easy ruleset and a not so long playtime makes it very funny and relaxing game. 
Luck factor is not so high, but it sometimes can change the score. 
Best with 3p, but very good with 2 players.

Das Design ist sicher nicht jeder Manns Ding, aber es funktioniert. Der Mechanismus funktioniert auch und sorgt für überschaubare Downtimes. Einzig das Auswerten kann manchmal ein wenig nervig sein. Da muss man ordentlich aufpassen. Auch scheinen einige Gebäude sehr stark zu sein im Vergleich zu anderen. Aber alles in allem ein solides Spiel.

Pretty good city builder.  Very simple.  Sometimes adding up all the effects a bit wearysome but not overwhelming.  Long term strategy difficult because you have no idea if any more restaurants will come up, for example.  Not an Alspach fan, either, but I admit he made a pretty decent one here.

As a fan of Simcity, this was immediately appealing to me.  I like that you get to build up your own little town, and each town has a character of its own.  I like that the effects of one tile on another make intuitive sense.  And I like that the value of a tile changes the longer it's been on the market, and will differ from game to game based on the random goals.

There's enough variation that I think we'll get quite a lot of plays out of this one.  And it plays with 2 players just fine.

"The game has a wonderful catch-up mechanism ... It's a very elegant implementation that I haven't seen elsewhere.

I love Suburbia at 2P count, as players are very free to pursue different strategies... Definitely do not like how random the game becomes at 4P.

The other minor quibble is that the number of "different" strategies are limited. That said, it is one of my favourite games, and I would never turn down a chance to play it."

Nice theme and artwork. Got that Sim City feeling, including the lack of player interaction. Sure, some buildings is affected by other players cities and you do compete for the same tiles on the track, but the main focus is always your own city. That, combined with the cute art style makes a round of Suburbia a cheerful event.

Tactical city building that involves interactions with tiles in 4+ different scopes. Subject to AP but it's quite inventive and fun. Try variants on the hidden objectives, like making them apply to all players or giving players more choices.

Suburbia est un jeu rapide et mécaniquement assez facile à prendre en main. La gestion de son argent et de sa population est une autre affaire, qui demande pas mal de réflexion et beaucoup d'observation. Tenir compte des divers bonus octroyés à chaque tuile posée est rébarbatif au début, mais rassurez-vous: pratique et concentration permettent de maîtriser tout ça facilement. Mais cette attention de tous les instants peut vite faire de Suburbia un jeu assez froid et cérébral...bonjour l'ambiance!

I know that judging by this game's rating here on the Geek I am in the minority, but I just found it a tedious and unfun exercise to play this game.  I'm not a big fan of tableau building games that force me to keep in mind everyone else's tableaus when it comes time to take my actions, because it can lead to severe AP and frankly, I just don't care to worry about what three other people are doing in the game (I can barely keep track of what I'm doing half the time).  Most of the time the choices seemed elementary and simplistic and after the mid-way of the game (when tableaus become large) most of one's turn is spent doing accounting trying to figure out who all is affected by the single tile I placed.  No thanks.

RATING: 8
Very quick plateau builder. The combos not only form your own city, but everyone else's as well, is very interesting and keeps you focused on what everyone is doing. The goals seem to be more important than anything else and I like that there is this tension between trying to achieve them while at the same time trying to get the right tiles even though they contradict the goal.

Very nice city building game. I like the way the market works and I like the combo's that can be made with the different tiles. The goals give direction and bring some welcome competition between players. I don't like the artwork, it is functional but too clean for my taste. That makes the game look and feel dry to me. Great gameplay though, still good after many plays.

Fun "town-building" game that excels at the level of player interaction for a euro.  If you like your games to be multiplayer solitaire, you might want to avoid this one. (That's not to say it's aggressive or mean, but that you need to watch what others are doing, and alter your play accordingly). Some neat rubberbanding mechanics, progression and timing between growing your income, reputation, and population.  I'm never a fan, however, of secret end-game bonuses, but that's a tiny part of the game.  All around solid.

This is a weird one. The convoluting scoring begs for mistakes - even when I play the iOS version and try to figure out how to score the tiles before the computer handles it, I never, ever, ever get it right. So it's definitely not a game I'd want to play the cardboard version of. But it seems like the kind of game that's way better with actual people sitting around a table - although I can see it being a nightmare trying to keep track of everybody's tiles. Also, the randomness of the available tiles is kind of disappointing. Conceptually I love it, but sadly, it misses the mark for me.

This is my favourite euro so far with possible contention from Shipyard should I ever get a copy / finish a full game. It's easy to teach and simple to play. Scoring is a little tricky for new players, but some small transparent discs should solve that problem. 

Every game plays out differently depending on what tiles are available and which public / private goals come out. Each player count has a different feel, but all play equally well. Lower player counts are more strategic but higher player counts are more interactive. Best of all is the way suburbs grow and stories evolve organically. Each player evolves their own identity and town history, sometimes to hilarious effect, which is a rare quality in a euro.

A fairly complex optimization / tile-laying game, with quite a bit of interaction compared to similar separate-player-board games. The last couple of turns bog down a little as the number of global-effect tiles grows (e.g. airports, which have effects based on total number of airports in play), but until then it's great fun, and worth that for the final scoring. I like it.

RATING: 6.5
I rather suspect the one game I have played so far of Suburbia was atypical in that all open goals were to be the worst at something. This, and my hidden goal to have the most green tiles, pretty much drove my entire strategy. I was terrible for everything except worker housing and my Soviet-style town managed to cash in big on bonuses having the least amount of imperialist capital blue developments (no need for a convenience store when the state supplies all your needs), worst reputation (jealousy from Capitalist Roaders who envy life in the Workers' Paradise no doubt) and the worst performing economy (down to kulak/Trotskyite wreckers). 

The game itself was quite enjoyable and played well, but as I was attempting to be the worst at everything I didn’t really get a ‘fair’ view of how the game plays. I did, however, win by a big ol’ heap of points, a fine victory for the people and thorough vindication for applied scientific socialism.

I would try this game again just to see if the victory conditions can be less extreme, i.e. economic and social success is rewarded. At this stage Suburbia is not on the ‘must purchase’ list but this may change after another game or three.

Really cool tile-laying city-building game. A delicate balancing act between getting income to be able to buy more tiles while also building reputation to attract more population. But as you increase your population, your reputation and income both drop. The tiles make sense thematically. It's light-ish, but plenty of decisions to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Suburbia is a nice design, but it doesn't really suit me.  I feel like the decision space in this game is smaller than it seems.  For example, after buying a tile, it might seem fun to figure out where to place the tile, but in fact it feels more like a math exercise: which placement optimizes for income?  When I play this game, I feel really confined:  income is tight, options are few and tile placement is a tedious math problem.

You spend the entire game trying to make a beautiful functional city and in the end the winner is resolved by bonus tiles (huge values). Hate the catch up mechanic à la Age of Steam - ruins the feeling of growth and does not award the "good" player.
The concept of a small fast civ game is great but the execution a little to dry and abstract.

I've only played this once and I might have mentioned it was a miserable experience. I remember the owner basically just explaining I won't understand anything and won't know how anything plays out into a larger strategy so just get tiles and put them wherever. This was very early in my introduction to the hobby and when I think back on it I just remember timidly buying a tile. Placing it with my other tiles, and then watching him move stuff on my board and then on the scoreboard. The other person at the table learning the game also just blankly stared at tiles and watched as the game was mostly played for us. It was weird and I acknowledge that a better teacher would have made the game better. But first impressions do a lot for you so I still don't like this game.

I've only played the iOS version single player campaign (which is really neat!) and a few games against AIs. 

The iOS version is probably one of those digital versions that remove the need to play the original, since the app takes care of counting out the income, population and reputation plus the effects that the tiles have on each other, which I understand can be a bit tricky.

I'm one of the rarer people who played Suburbia after playing The Castles of Mad King Ludwig.

-Pretty simple, as long as you can calculate a bit
-Discovering big combos is very satisfying, especially the investment marker (this lessens with playthroughs, as you're pulling off the same combos again and again)
[b]Dislike:[/b]
-No interaction (except buying stuff your opponent might want)
-Fiddly calculations, especially for new players
-More people makes the game worse

So many interesting decisions the make, and the effects of every tile fit the theme enjoyably perfect. The investment marker is one of the most satisfying pieces/mechanics I've come across in gaming. Initially, the game can also pretty funny, but that fades away after a few games.

I find it a little too bad though that it can get a little fiddly when a lot of effects are effecting each other, but finding that awesome combo that raises a certain stat sky-high is just awesome! Also, I hate how little interactivity there is between the players. It has that thing I don't like in gaming where in the end you're just like "ow, seems like I played a little more efficient than you." If a game doesn't benefit from more players, it's not something I'm really excited about. You don't really care what your opponents are building in this game.

A puzzley tile laying game. Usually there's optimum placement which can be a little boring. This game has some of the worst artwork of all time and is extremely dull on the table. A cardinal sin for a game where you're trying to building something of value.

This is a really great game with lots of theme. Once the rules of the game are understood, it is easy to teach and play. Goals in the game are very important; If you aren't paying attention to the goals until later in the game, it can be very difficult to catch up. The components are artwork are beautiful and complement the game very well. This is a really fun lighter middle weight game.

I really enjoy Suburbia. It's very simple and straightforward, but it's also very satisfying to see a city grow in front of you. It really needs Suburbia Inc. to give the game any sort of longevity, however, as many of the tiles from the base game are going to come out from game to game. I'm also not sure how accurate the goals are valued at, but they haven't been the deciding factor in many games, so this doesn't bother me that much.

I would rather play Castles of Mad King Ludwig at this point.

One of the first board games I've played. I enjoyed the trading and managing funds, creating a city from the tiles, and thinking ahead to future benefits from the multiplier tiles and goals bonus. Many things to think about during so there really wasn't much interaction with my opponent. Although I liked the game it is one I would play occasionally, not often.

Anyone who compares this game to SimCity is doing it a disservice.  Suburbia is fun, but the only thing it shares with SimCity is a similar theme.  The gameplay is all about finding good combos with tiles and setting yourself up for success later in the game, and while it is certainly fun, a little more player interaction (outside of blocking each other from taking tiles and the occasional bonus from someone else's suburb) would be welcome.

A solid 8.  Good, but not quite great.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting tile-laying game, quite similar to Glen More in that adding new tiles would trigger the other tiles in your tableau in different ways, so what to acquire and how to place the tile is a crucial part of the game.

The goal seems to be the central focus of the game - probably more so than the tiles, as they add a lot to the final score. Often the tiles are balanced enough that any approach you make is decent as long as you make sense, so everyone' score will be similar. 

The theme is here, the game play is satisfying, however I wonder if the game necessarily rewards good play, especially with the bonus tiles. Often these will affect the final scoring much more than how well you manage the city throughout the game.

The game has a very good core. It just needs a lot of fine-tune to be a good game.

Really fun, quick, snappy game. The theme is pretty engaging, the gameplay interesting, and it is a good length for the amount of depth. Surprisingly not as replayable as I imagined - by the fifth game, I'm already craving more variability. Looking to the upcoming expansion, I think that will add a LOT more to the replayability of Suburbia, and seems almost a necessary addition. Have only played 2 player, looking forward to trying this out with more!

RATING: 6
Never has a game I've played come down to the player that has made the best city. Usually it is the player that has completed the right combination of objectives. This would be fine if it were about hidden objectives, but the game isn't about hidden objectives, it is about building a city. Worse, due to the way the objectives are set up, sometimes you get opposing objectives, basically handing your opponent the win before the game ever starts. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only played with 4 players, and with 4 the game doesn't seem to have enough time to develop.  The "winner" isn't the individual with the optimal / most creative city arrangement.  Rather, the winner tends to be determined solely by objectives.  For a game that should be *about* tile interactions, that's a huge disappointment.

That said, the game is quick to pick up.  The interactions between tiles are cute, and there is a sense of creating something.  I'd imagine that with 2 or 3 players, the game would provide a better experience.

Really enjoy this game, but find it a little hard to table, as it requires someone who can enjoy the math.

Building cities is just good fun. I found the base a little one dimensional, and a couple of tiles are poor design choices, but the expansion massively improved it for me.

**House Rules:**

I took out the Casino and the PR Company, because - well - they are bad design. They come up early and they are unbalanced in power to the point where getting them becomes 50% of the strategy of the game. Except it's all ultimately luck if it's your turn when they appear. Dumb.

The dominance of the early income/late reputiation & population strategy makes the game a bit unfriendly to novices, but overall it's a great game. It is long and has a lot of accounting, so not for everyone. Can also play a bit solitaire-ish, but there are interactive mechanics.

After one play I found it far too easy to let AP set in, but that's improved with repeat plays.  Multi-player brings this alive, since there's a enough interplay between boroughs without it feeling overwhelming.

Played 4p and really liked it (though there were some nitpicks). I expect 3p would be better, but I love the theme and logical consistency, the clean yet systematic styles, and how you can combo based on how you build the suburb. Spacewise, its not too big, and it feels thematic with the actions.

I was not crazy about watching my tiles for each little activation, but I suspect getting some tokens to mark which tiles activate things would help (and also some are only for adjacency). I also kind of wish the artwork was more vibrant, but I understand thats the cost for its small, portable size. I also didnt like some goals tiles and think it couldve been clarified a bit more. And some, like "least income" or "least reputation" (both of which I had had) felt counterintuitive to do while scoring points.

I like how building your money first is important since the red bars keep the winners down, that is a good design imo. I was also a bit biased since I won with 125 (and couldve won with 140) so I feel good about that game. Another minor nitpick is the luck in the tile flip, timing, and individual bonus markers, but I think this is necessary to give it a lot of replayability and force the players to think and mitigate. The individual bonus markers also make it a mystery who is in the lead and the red bars keep the bonus tiles relevant, preventing runaway leaders too much from what I can see.

Overall, I really loved it. It was a lot more charming than I had expected. I like this more than CoMKL too, since its so much smoother and cleaner. I also really love how the points is called Population, and the naming of income and reputation. Brilliant little thematic touch!

Plays: 4+

After a couple plays, I find myself finding this game just a bit on the light side. I wish there was more gameplay or depth and its felt a bit more fiddly watching for activations than I like.

Reasons for trading away: too light, a tiny bit fiddly to set up (expansion actually made this worse), 2p mode sucks (or is subpar at least), isn't actually that newb friendly with all the constant checks and updates to your board (I don't mind but its a little annoying when I have to keep checking for others or when I dont feel as much of a challenge), and its a rather simple strategy game (just play conservatively on your 0, +2 tiles and keep income up in beginning, switch to reputation midway, get your goal tiles and at least one center tile, and you're set). I didn't find it mindblowing in anyway though the theme helped but just wasn't an amazing game that made me excited like PG or HT were and not as interesting long term after the initial luster wore off. There are also pretty much zero clever plays or memorizing moments that I can recall - its just a solid game with a solid experience and very little wrong but not a whole lot right.

Liked it, gameplay is very simple, pay for a tile, place that tile, adjust city income + city reputation, collect income and population (based on city reputation).

 I'm amazed how thematic it turns out. Everybody wants to live next to the Park, but faraway of the airport for instance. Or the new and dandy fancy restaurant gets you a lot of income but if there are more restaurants available, then it begins to diminish...thematic.

It's a nice tile laying game! You have to think what tile you will buy and where to place in your city. There is some interactions with others players with some effects but it's never aggressive. The buildings create realistic effects that affect your reputation, your growth and your fortune. The rules are straightforward. I like to play it until 3 players. With 4 players, it doesn't bring a lot and it can be a lot of downtime.

Suburbia provides a decent city building experience with its rather dull looking components. The interconnected nature of all of the various development tiles is thematic, but unfortunately causes the maths involved to become increasingly more complex as the game progresses.

Gameplay feels puzzle-like and slow, with even less player interaction than a Worker Placement game.

With complicated math requirements, solitaire gameplay, and visually unappealing components, Suburbia didn't stand a chance with my game group.

RATING: 8
There are lots of options in this game, but it is quite tough to figure out.  There is a run away leader rule that keeps people from getting too far behind, but a pro at this game will destroy you.

It can be frustrating learning because there are populations and income to concern yourself with and as you move up in money, population goes down.  It becomes a kind of optimal brain-teaser that can get tough.

The way the different tiles work together gives you ample amount of flexibility to build the city that you are keen on...as close to Sim City as I have seen in a board game!

RATING: 7.5
Surprised by how highly rated this one is. Probably the theme helps. It has a similarity to Glen More with activating adjacent tiles.
-----
Upped from 6.5. The Glen More likeness is more the mnemonic than the actual mechanic, but either way it's burdensome, and there are probably a few tile effects that get overlooked in each game -- really, you need a computer for this type of chore work. Great gateway game if you can get past the hurdle of explaining how the tile effect mechanic works. The high novelty factor wears off after a few games once the tiles have all been seen.
-----
Realize now that it's meant to be much lighter and disposable than all that. Suburbia as Cribbage. Luck of the draw plays an outsize role, but the game is short enough that it feels right.

RATING: 7
One of the easiest games to explain to non-gamers I've seen in ages: Folks, it's Sim City: The Board Game, and it fits that definition to a T.  The only reason I'm not rating it higher is a) the fiddliness of the pieces is really off-putting to non-gamers, which negates the initial appeal, but if they can push through there's enjoyment to be had; and b) there seems to be a clear path to victory from the tiles in any given game... and the game doesn't announce that path until the 3rd Act, where you've either developed the right path for the C tiles or you're not as lucky.

Also, while goals create extra tension and strategy, hidden goals kind of break the game for me. Drops to 5.5 with hidden goals.

Still, a rather fun game and my favorite from Ted.

I really wanted to like this game - and fortunately I did!

It's a tableau builder with some nice ideas. A spatial element is always interesting, and the ability to key off different subsets of tiles (including your opponents) allows for a variety of different effects. As with other engine builders, knowing the available tiles helps your cause greatly.

The only criticisms I have are that games can sometimes be samey (get income with blue/yellows, get reputation with gray/green), and in person it is extremely difficult to keep track of all the effects.

I've played this a few times, and while I enjoy it, I can see it getting old. The problem we ran into was that the points awarded for the secret missions can vary from ten to twenty points, and ten points can easily be a game winning difference. We tried to solve this by only giving secret missions of all the same value, and this seemed to work out a bit. It'll probably require more plays, but I don't foresee it becoming a classic in our group.

More than one year after, tired of not finding any offer, I finally decided to buy it at full price... I'm not disappointed at all. 
It’s a fresh game, quite original, elegant and it really seems to have been polished a lot. Tiles seem to offer different strategies and there also seem to be a lot of diversity.
I want to play more and see how different seems the second game and I might even raise more the score!

The second game was incredible. Different tactics and thrilling win in the last second! I raise my raiting from 8.3 to 8.5.

Could play again but it is one of the games where knowing which buildings combo with each/others helps a lot so might not be a good game to play on my regular group.

What an awesomely balanced and fun city-builder, probably the best one out there.  The game plays very intuitively and everyone becomes very invested in their city.  After the first 1 or 2 games you will really love your creation.

This is one of those games where even when you lose it doesn't really bother you because you made an entire city with its own unique personality.

So is the game interactive with other players?  Definitely.  Some parts of your city can affect others and vice versa.  You always want to know how you're benefiting or hurting another player as it can mean victory or defeat.  The scores usually stay pretty even towards the end of the game so every move counts!

Even solo play is fun!

Very enjoyable tile-and-resource juggling act which is accessible without having to learn the power tiles (this is a good enough commendation in itself). A wide spread of possible game-end points is effective and very necessary.

In a strange way, a great story-telling game too, as you find yourself building a hippie San Francisco town (parks, lakes, lots of people, no money) or a corrupt 1950's mafia-driven city (skyscrapers, casinos, tons of money but terrible reputation).

I think it might be best with 2 or 3, with attention paid to blocking and disrupting the competitors.

The premise is simple- grow a small town into a large town, buying developments and adding them to your individual array. Some developments only effect adjacent tiles, others your whole town, and some effect every player. These are not once-off events, either: effects have continuous duration so upkeep can become complex, albeit not onerous.

I quite like Suburbia. It isn't a brain burner (hello City Tycoon) and plays very quickly, with more interaction than I was expecting. There is plenty of opportunity to annoy other players by way of interfering with the market of available tiles.

An easy game in which you build your own city, not exactly how you'd like to build it but just trying to maximize your income at first and your population later. Some interesting outcomes appear, such as pushing your town into a specific direction paying the consequences and gaining the benefits.

I do not like the fiddliness.  A friend who loves Through The Ages called this game too fiddly.  To be fair, we play that game online.  I suspect Suburbia could have a very good online implementation. I suspect the ipad makes it a much better game.  Live, though, the work to fun ratio is too high.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays well with 2, I also really enjoy it with 3 (haven't played with 4 and I'm not sure I want to).
- Sim City the board game, enough said.
- Nice components, I actually really like the graphic design and aesthetics in this game. Once you finish constructing your city it looks great.
- I really enjoy all the different ways the various tiles interact with each other, and the variety of the buildings themselves.
- Having to balance your income versus reputation is really difficult and since different tiles come out every game, this is a game you can play a lot.
- This game is usually pretty tight and the winner is not decided till the end.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]We have played 3p and mostly 2p games so far and we all love this game. It absolutely recreates the feeling of playing SimCity when I was a kid.

I love the graphic design and the simple aesthetics of the game, once your city is built it is beautiful. We always spend time after playing to describe what kind of city we built and if it reminds us of a city we have been to/ or know about. Excellent game, this is the replacement for Monopoly my son has been looking for since his favorite aspect of that game was buying properties and making $. I can't recommend this game highly enough!

As far as playing with my family, I believe my 8 year old daughter could handle it, but so far she has not wanted to play this one yet. My son (11) is excellent at the game and has no problems keeping track of all the information in the game on each turn.[/i]

Sim City the hex tile laying game. Combines a lot of elements of games I like into a delightful package. Can be enjoyed by players who aren't hardcore gamers, although it's a bit intimidating to them at first. The intuitive theme helps a lot with this.

Played it once in psychical format and then like a ton on the Ipad. I like this game a lot. It has a lot of moving parts and a lot of room for strategy. The campaign mode is super hard. It also makes you play in a way that is suboptimal for real play, (basically asking you to limit certain resources that help you win in a normal game, such as population.)

First game played went really well. Had the unstoppable combo of PR Firm and Casino, which helped me win the game. Liked the need to balance between Reputation and Income, while taking care not to pull too far ahead in population at all times. Wife had to perform the High School action 3x (using one investment action) to catch up and the final score was just a 5 point difference despite her being quite far behind for the middle part of the game. Love all the combos that one can do in this game.

A simple and clever game of building a city. You and your fellow players each build their own section of the city. But all players can benefit or suffer from buildings built in all players' sections of the city. For example if you build a building that gives you +1 income for all restaurants, you would score +1 for every restaurant built so far by all players in the game. 

The game turn is as simple as purchasing a tile and placing it in your city area. Then you collect the income and reputation based on how the tiles interact with your other tiles and other players' tiles. 
Wonderful game, great for 2 players, probably even more fun with more and a great week night game.

More tactical than strategic, this is nevertheless the most interesting city builder I've played, including things like Sim City and Cities Skylines on PC. It's much less of a sandbox than those PC games - there's a real competitive game to enjoy here. Also I love the aesthetic, a kind of modernist minimalism but with a splash more colour than that description may imply. I find that euros often suffer from visual busyness or an off-putting cartoonish look, but the tone set by the artwork here is just right.
There's also a pleasing amount of player interaction here - besides the familiar 'hate drafting', players can exploit each others' building choices (my rivals build a lot of residential areas so I start a homeowners' association to rake in the cash, for instance).

RATING: 9
Wonderfully-designed, tile-placement game I show people after Catan or Ticket to Ride because the strategy and the gameplay is very simple to grasp. Turns only involve one action and the mechanics of "activating" tiles are plain and easy to understand. For me, the best part of the game is the "catch" to "growing your population"/gaining points: it affects your income and the points you'll score next turn. Also, I love the constant weighing of public and private goals; it only slightly affects the amount of AP in the game, but it provides randomness and intrigue in a game that would be pretty dull without it. And the expansions definitely add to the variety of the base game, not get in the way of what made it so fun in the first place. Always a pleasure to play Suburbia.

This is a mid-level Gamers' game about building out a Suburb/City. This is an excellent city/tableau building game that has immense depth and re-playability yet is able to be won by a first timer. The game is so smooth in that it teaches and play extremely well with little effort. Once a new player grasp the concept of how the tiles effect each other they can just run with it, and we have had several first time players win. The Goals in the game give players, especially new players a direction in to which they should start building their Suburb. This really eases the learning curve and early decision analysis paralysis of players because there is only a limited amount of choices each turn but endless combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This turns out to be a simple drafting game. 6 tiles in the draft, each tile costing less the longer it's been in the draft as the tiles before it get taken and they shuffle along to the right. The tiles make the game, or rather the decisions you make on which tiles to collect win the game. Or even more rather, getting lucky when the tiles you've collected to date are supplemented later in the game by combos and they're not the ones that have been discarded pre-game. Which makes the result seem more like a gambling game than a drafting game. The tiles have all sorts of info to take into account - do you want more income (almost undoubtedly), instant VP's, each-turn VPs, combos which earn you money or VPs now or later. And so on and so on. Book-keeping gala. Hope your combos come. And hope no one takes them before you. As such, the decisions throughout the game are engaging, and there's replay on offer as you explore the combos available, but in the end, it's just a tile drafting game where you're playing in hope rather than expectation.

AP. Math. Sim City. Coolness. Nuff said.

Actually, this game is probably the boardgame that presently comes closest to Sim City; but one important aspect to note is that Suburbia has players working on their own city, instead of all players contributing to one shared city.

RATING: 6
"Very clever, but has too many types of building effects, which means there is too much to track."

What I like:
- Nice theme; minimal screwage
- Pretty good graphic design and components
- Only took 75 minutes, which was quicker than expected

What I don't like:
- Way too much to track, across multiple boards
- Too many different kinds of tile scoring
- Heavy reliance on majority scoring
- Non-intuitive mechanisms make learning games tough
- Scoring track really needs directional arrows

Overall, it's a near miss for me. I don't like games with so many different things interacting with other different things. This is especially bad in that some things are adjacent, some are within your board, and some are game-wide. Plus some are "what something else is adjacent to". It's all just a bit much.

I agree with the 2.7 weight.

Coming up with your own twisted narrative for why the nuclear power station is next to the elementary school is optional but highly recommended.

First try last night after the first day of Spiel '12 in Essen:

It's a nice game, very fast to learn the rules and get going, but great depth in strategy. It's somewhat "multi solitaire"; the only interaction is whther the tiles you plan for is still there when it's your turn, and the gain others get from some tiles you build. All 15-20 rounds are very similar even if your economy grows, so it might be boring to play often. 

After second try: Money is the key to everything. 

After some more plays: It's a nice game that you can play now an then, but not to often since it gets "old" quite fast, and you really repeat the same action over and over.

This is another one of those games that is in my wheelhouse!  City building, tableau building, and very puzzley!  You always have to keep an eye on everyone's city.  Money management and ascending the population (aka, points) track at the right rate is key!  This one is a modern classic.  Very very good!

Based on one play: One of those games where you build up your area by buying tiles and as it gets bigger tiles tend to work together to get you more and more points or money. In this one, the tiles move your income or point track up and down which determines how many points you get each turn. Where it gets interesting is that there are also objectives that give bonus points. Each player has their own hidden one, but four are visible to everyone and they are worth a lot, so you must build up your area while also fighting for those objectives.

Suburbia is a city-building game in which players are drafting hex tiles to place in their personal play area.  The hexes will provide some sort of benefit, and may also help the players compete for one of the public or personal end-game goals.  Tiles may have effects that trigger based on the tiles next to them, the tiles on that player's board, or tiles in any players' boards.  The interesting thing is, tiles will have an immediate effect for any qualifying tiles when they are placed, but will also have continuing effects for subsequent qualifying tile placements.  This game has some interesting ideas, and you're definitely forced to pay attention to what everyone else is doing, but because of the tile draft, you don't end up having that much control over what ends up in your play area.

Super nice components and solid gameplay makes this game a good choice. It was a bit mathy, but I think it was more that you had to keep track of so many things that it made it more laborious than it should have been. It played relatively quick and I am unsure of what I think about the goals.

I do think if all players are actively working towards the goals, the game plays much smoother. If anyone starts slacking, giving the goals to other players will literally cost you the game. Also, not really fond of the investment markers. They work, but barely. You have to back track on tiles if you apply it to such a tile and it can be difficult/impossible to remember the effects of it. Still, I rather like the game and would easily play more of it when asked.

A city building game where you have to balance your prestige (= points each turn) and income via building (buying) city tiles from the central offering. I like the spatial aspect of planning the city - each tile makes synergies or penalties quite thematically with the other tiles. The artwork is a bit too simplistic (somewhat prototype-like), otherwise very enjoyable game.

I like the base game alone better than with the expansion. Expansion adds complexity and play time for not much benefit in my opinion.

A very satisfying game, where accomplishing goals and building an engine of economy and reputation is always a balancing act. Figuring out that balance is a moderate brain-burner, rewarding the player who thinks with the big picture in mind. It took a few plays to really understand the fine tuning of the borough, combining multiple tiles to get quite beautiful combinations. Easy to learn and more enjoyable after multiple plays. Usually play 2-player games, and it works very well, although I usually lose.

Edit: Still great, but after a handful of plays the game was really begging for expansions. Added Suburbia Inc. and that adds a lot of interesting stuff, making the game better in many ways.

The choice points in this are brilliant. You need money and population, but there are always multiple ways to get them. Get cash now or build income? Get instant population, build reputation, or aim for goals? In any given play through the game, you need to do a little bit of each of these.
Since the line-up is random, though, the game doesn't grind to a halt as you try to puzzle out a solution. Each turn is pretty short.

The synergies of the different tiles and the strategic elements of when to boost income and reputation appeal to me a lot. Later in the game the book-keeping can slow things down a bit.

Overall a nice game, but it caters too much to the casual gamer for me. Your borough at the end of the game is rather small, you get the feeling you didn't get to do much in the entire game. The choices you face when thinking of purchasing tiles are rather similar: nothing is quite really bad to buy or good with the exception of the "Waterfront" tile. This is an obviously overpowered tile that breaks the 2 player game experience and gives a strong advantage to its owner on 3-4 players. The hidden objectives of this game are an afterthought (see thank you section in instruction manual) which should not have been integrated in the game since this is not a deduction game (out of 20 objectives you will probably never guess right and players have no real penalty in not accomplishing their secret goal). Finally, playing only a certain quantity of tiles is great for "a different game each time" but really hinders strategy since you may be building a borough with a certain strategy in mind which you will later find out was not even going to be playable since your synergy tiles were in the tiles that were not even played in the game. I was completely charmed by the potential of this game and the girlfriend loves the theme, but it is too short with only two phases (build income, then build reputation - end game) and there is too much luck for it to be a real strategy game. I am not sure what Mensa found so interesting in this.

Tile-laying meets SimCity. I will always like playing this game even if I am not good at it. Its just abstract enough to ignore for some people (although I like it) and the depth of play means that no one game is the same. It would almost be better with some kind of auction mechanic to negate the luck-of-the-draw on the market--but at least that can be hedged if you have the money to buy properties higher up in the market.

Probably the best SimCity vibe game currently. Tile placement city builder, mid-weight Euro (engine building). Tile placement follows various set bonus scoring, some are coattail scoring. There are several levels of combos triggered off of tile placement. Ultimately its about zoning optimization. Mechanics enhance the theme

Personal and collective variable point scoring goals. Thus multiple paths to victory. Plays well with all player counts, solo game available.

-Tile artwork, while clean, is a little drab. There can be quite a bit of bookkeeping each turn, it can be easy to forget some triggers when placing tiles. For a mid weight game, the turns are quick, but it can play a little long.

Compared to Between Two Cities: a heavier, more strategic, variable and competitive Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and simple to play city building game, that gives you a lot of interesting choices and synergy between tile placements. It's fun when your tiles get you benefits from things other players have on their boards.

I like this a lot, but I'm not sure how I feel about the mechanic of only playing with about half the tiles each game. You might see a tile that gives +1 income per airport built from now on and then never have any airports come up, just out of randomness. Also, the graphic design is more than a bit dry. When this game was first released I didn't pick it up just because I didn't like the look of it. Overall the game-play won me over.

So much fun. It's my only city-builder and I love looking at my masterpiece afterwards. I find some of the goal tiles can contradict. Being that we can't know other players secret goals, it seems to give advantage to a player who does not have contradictory tiles. Jason loves this game so that's a big plus. I've tried the first solo variant and wasn't thrilled. I'm hoping Dale the Bot offers more tension.

A must-have for Sim City lovers! This is definitely the best city building game on the market. It's not terribly complex but has great gameplay and mechanics. Activating other tiles with combos is the heart of the game. You have to manage income and population wisely. If you have too many people and not enough income, the game can become very unpleasant for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The variety of tile interaction and the sliding market make for a game where your strategy will fall apart if you aren't able to rapidly shift your tactics. You have to build up both economies of income and reputation without growing so fast you burn out, or so slow you never get hot. You have to know when to pull in money and when to dump it all and try and push your population growth as fast and hard as possible. 

A game where every tile interacts with other tiles, often retroactively, requiring a certain amount of tracking, but allows for great combinations.

One thing I really like about this game, even moreso than in the sequel 'The Castles of Mad King Ludwig' is that by game's end, you have a really funky little city with its own story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After several plays of Castles of Mad King Ludwig I got to try this. Slightly simplified version of Castles, all hexes are same shape and colour which is not super thematic. Lots of things to keep track of and hence get missed. Will always prefer Castles over this, even though this is playable.

RATING: 7
Nice city builder, you buy tiles from a drafting line paying the cost plus a position premium. As tiles remain on the board they become cheaper. You need to what will work best on your board, several things  adjust depending on adjacent tiles and for that matter non-adjacent tiles which can be tedious. Income, population (VPs), prestige (population growth) for several factors when placing on your board.
It looks nice and give a thematic feeling for city growth.
It does have a lot of downtime, because people have to review what is in the tile draft when their turn comes around, to try to optimize their purchase

Love love love Suburbia and never gets old! I always describe it to newbies as SimCity as a board game but even that sells it short a bit in how deep this game is.

Only played this on iOS, but think there is a lot to like here. The app handles the number updating of income, cash, reputation, and population so well that I suspect playing in real life would have me slightly fed up with how fiddly manually calculating all of that would be. Still I like the relatively quick pacing on this one while still feeling like there is plenty of interesting decisions about what to buy and where to place it. 

Update: Finally got around to playing this in real life, and my suspicions were correct. I like this game better as an app that does all the calculations for you. In real life a good half the time spent playing the game was just incrementing income, reputation, and population for every player. It's still a good game and is fun, but I think the app gives a better experience than the physical version.

First of all, it's a very fine game. Lots of replayability in the box. Being mostly tactical, it's rarely predictable and always forces you to stay on your toes. The spatial element is interesting and makes you think about the shape of your future city (even more so with the "Suburcia INC." expansion). Also, it's satisfying to observe your little city grow. All of it makes "Suburbia" an enjoyable experience.

I have to say though, I did think I will like it more. It doesn't have a lot of that SimCity feel to me, most of the tiles are either "profit" or "reputation", rest doesn't matter. But that's the game in essence: balancing two factors, your money and reputation. It's definitely more "mathy" than "buildy", for lack of better word. In the end, the city looks like a bunch of random, colorful blobs, doesn't have that epic look of, say, "Carcassonne".

An amazingly good game with a very nice ios implementation. 
-3/2/15 

Went from an 8 to a 10. I was worried about getting tired of playing f2f due to the app and about expansion glut with the expansion. My concerns were taken care of after taking out some tiles to even out the game with the expansion. 

This is great on the ios and is great in person as well and the expansion is once some tiles are removed. 

It is easy to make a mistake in priorities early that will hurt later or to overvalue the goal tiles  but avoiding such things is part of the fun. This is definitely a top 20 game for me now and may be top ten material. Great game.

Quite a bit drier than I expected - but easy to play. We got a rule wrong that made the game half an hour longer than it should have been, but I never really did feel overly engaged at anytime. Decisions were fairly straightforward, with the key being placement of each business or building rather that it's purchase. Otherwise, a fairly enjoyable point multiplying game - but I'd rather play Big City for its theme.

Really enjoying this game.  Lots of interesting decisions, but not a real brain burner.  A bit fiddly, but the fiddliness here doesn't bother me too much.

I've played Suburbia now with a friend and with my wife and it's a fun game.  I definitely prefer this one to Ginkgopolis, but both are still fun.  I was afraid when I first saw the boards that this might use an auction mechanic, but it does not - it actually works out more like Morels with things you can buy shifting down over time and forcing you to pay more to take something when it is first revealed.  If shifting tiles down in a conveyor-belt manner bothers you, this might not be your game.  Other than that bit of fiddliness, it's a great Euro and one that I think does help avoid the old "I need more blues" or "you have more yellow than me"... instead you hear people saying things like "I think I'll build an elementary school to bring in more people" or "This parking lot will really help my income!"

A good, not overly complex middle-weight euro. 
Based on my limited experience I don't really like tile placement as a core mechanic, but here it is incorporated into a bit of engine building, a bit of secret objectives and so it suits my tastes much more. I really love the arc the game tries to tell you: first you try to build up your economy to support the growth in your suburb then you try to increase your reputation (and parellel to that your population) while trying to reduce the negative impact of the population growth. Based on the two games I played you did your job well, when you finish the game with your economics falling apart but with just enough money to finish your plans.
I like the secret objectives and can see, how two experienced gamers can start to anticipate what the others' hidden objective could be. 
On the negative side, I don't know if the airport/restaurant/skycraper strategy would be efficient and if you add more tiles (with the expansions) their effectiveness dilute even more.
Currently I lack good middle weight euros (alongside the likes of Castles of Burgundy) so this is definetely a keeper in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
The mechanics here feel very reminiscent of many other games I've played, but Suburbia's greatest strength might come in it's streamlined design. Basically, you build your town/engine up for the first half of the game, then you flip the switch and see who can acquire the highest population in the uncertain amount of time that's left over. Watch the end game conditions closely. Perhaps the only thing missing from the game is some token/counters to place on tiles that active constantly throughout the game. There were quite a few times where I discovered I'd missed something a turn or two afterwards, and it's nearly impossible to re-calculate everything if you need to.

Edit: Upon more plays, I've also realized the flaw in the end game goal tokens. It's entirely possible to receive a goal that contradicts another goal. Definitely creates a small disadvantage for that player.

Overall: Very enjoyable, but a few easy tweaks could improve it.

RATING: 7
This is an economic builder with echoes of Carcassonne, St. Petersburg, and Vegas Showdown. It has simple rules but offers lots to think about, and lots of nice combinations are possible. On the downside, there are a variety of ways that tiles interact with other tiles, not only in your own tableau but also in your opponents'. That's not a bad thing, but it's difficult to track. We have made quite a few mistakes by forgetting that when HE adds a residential tile, SHE gets $2, and so on.

Not at its best with two players, I think. Haven't tried it with more, but with two some of the tiles and goals seem quite overpowered. Having more players would smooth that out.

A nice tile laying game with a cool theme.  The artwork is nice and clean, and I like seeing my city form over the course of a game.

I wish there was some element of police/fire stations but it's fine as is, and might possibly over complicate the elegance of the set up.

I quite enjoy Suburbia and it's been a hit with the family too with its relatable theme.

Wish list.  Fun Sim-City like game.  It's nice that you are building one area of the city, but some of the tiles in your city score differently based on the other player's tiles.

Bit of an analysis paralysis trap on the last turn.  If you let yourself you can calculate your possible final scores based on buying each of the tiles available to you.  I'd recommend that you quickly go with your gut and have a good laugh at the end if you picked the wrong tile.  :)

Fun game.  I've played it once and want to play it again.

I immediately saw some similarities between Suburbia and The Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  It has a similar feel.  You can tell it's from the same designer.  If you like one you will probably like the other.  I like Suburbia quite a bit more.

Perhaps my biggest reserve is the scoring mechanisms in these games seem too complicated.  I think they are just a bit too fiddly.  You will find yourself going through so many checks each time you place a tile just to verify how everything can be adjusted.  It's not too hard.  It's not enough for me to avoid the game.  It's just not...well, streamlined.  Not elegant.

Still fun!  :)

~20 moves in 3 hours = long and AP-prone. I like the idea of the game but the execution is immature -- you can't even speed up or slow down the game as it's always one tile a turn.

Light/medium City building game.  Theme makes sense with decent mechanics though for my initial games, I found it too calculation heavy but in subsequent games, it seemed pretty manageable and no longer a detriment to game play. 

The more I play it, the more it grows abit on me though its certainly not one of my top favourites.

After one play of this game with all expansions, this seemed to have a nice flow. It feels mellow and seems like it would reward multiple plays.

My only concerns are that it has relatively little interaction, the decisions often seem obvious (although I didn't score highly, so may be missing something!) and it has that annoying thing where you need to constantly be tallying-up points opportunities - including looking at what opponents' tableaus have. Those are common to many modern games, though, and this one has nicer mechanisms than most.

I only played the Android application of this game (which works really well btw), so choose to ignore this comment.

Suburbia is a very pleasant tile laying game with a well-integrated theme You need a game or two to get how you should balance population growth and income. With a little experience most decisions are pretty much straight forward, which allows for smooth play.

However, there this is not a very deep game, but has a ton of bookkeeping. On a smart device, the computer is doing most of this for me, but doing this on my own and checking how many buildings of a certain type my opponents have really keeps me from playing a physical copy. If I have the opportunity, I will give it a try though.

Update: Habe played it a physical game finally. As I expected there is a lot of bookkeeping and probably  some errors were done, but the game still was playing smoothly. In total, a good game.

Fantastic game. Fast, deep, it seems to have many strategies, you can teach to anybody while playing. I love the graphics too, very simple but elegant. Mechanics are so bounded with theme that sometimes you create strange and ridiculous situations (like a school near a heavy industry or a hospice near a radioactive site)

Easy to understand game play that just makes sense.  Not quite Sim City in board game form  as it's not that complex (i.e there isn't utility management for example).  However, as a board game it truly makes you think and plan. It just great to watch your borough expand and there is a real feel of building something.   There is player interaction with a many tiles that make you keep your eye on your opponents borough especially if you need to get rid of one; however, there isn't in-your-face aggression against each other.  The nastiest part is when you decide to play a little defense and pay to remove or turn a tile into a lake that your opponent could use.   Money it truly tight at first and if you don't create a good money engine early then you will struggle.  If I had to compare it to something, it has the building aspects of Glen More with the end conditions similar to Kingdom Builder, however, there is not only public ending condition point there are secret agent end of game points, just perfect for this game.  Just a spectacular game that is easy to learn and has good strategic and tactical decisions.

4-player game takes too long and the downtime is quite long. You can't be really plan too much ahead in a 4-player game. Tile placement is very trivial and overall the game isn't very deep compared to the playing time. Even the theme doesn't come through the system. This might be good as a 2-player game filler but nothing else really. 

Useless game since Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a million times better game. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is improved game in every aspect. The fanboys can't seem to admit the fact.

RATING: 6
Current players criticize classic roll & move games for intrinsically random (unfairly) and too samey (fairly). In twenty years the multiplayer solitaire games like this will be viewed as intrinsicly fiddly and error-prone (unfairly) and samey (fairly). 
Some designers are clearly stuck in rut (driven by a vocal section of players) of creating solitaire puzzles. In this case buying tiles which either earn income or victory points and which interact with each other (+1 X or Y per tile of Z type which is adjacent/in your town/on the board). The basic strategic dynamic is establishing early income and knowing when to switch to generating victory points (and of course setting up that switch). but the flaw/feature is that where-as a game like Dominion does this elegantly Suburbia requires the tracking of a host of potential interactions. If you enjoy mastering the fiddly rules then that is a selling point, but if not you will find it is too easy to miss something or make an error and as other players are not tracking your personal little board this could substantially alter the outcome of the game (did you really earn that win or did some combination of errors hand it to you?).

As a big fan of the Sim City series of games (excluding the awful SC5, of course!) back from the days of the Spectrum - I had to give this a try. And I was not disappointed.

The one player option does work well and gives a fun solo play option.

Obviously, it is better with more players. It plays well for 2, but I think plays better for 3-4 players. Early turns go past quickly, but forward thinking is important to optimise where things go in your city as you can't go back and change later (no just selecting the bulldoze option here!). 

Overall, i really enjoy Suburbia and it is definitely one of my favorite games at present.

I was surprised how much I liked this game - the mechanics are exceedingly clever and take several layers of understanding both how to grow adequately as well as a keen eye to identify tiles that could cost you the game if left to be purchased by an opponent. Worth noting that I am reviewing the iOS version, the book keeping seems a bit much for the physical game so take half a point off my rating if needed.

RATING: 6.5
newbies in my game were not taught the importance of the tiles for the end-game scoring. At the end, I thought 1 scoring tile should be shown after the start of each group of tiles is started, giving some strategy to using them, but not a full-on strategy to win from the get-go (that everyone adopts). Or take a note from Garden  Competition, and not show any end-game bonuses outright. Make a turn consist of looking at 1-2 of the tiles instead of laying down a tile; very much like how the x2 tokens are used, losing a turn to do so. I wouldn't have thought about trying to "fix" the parts I saw in need of fixing, but I did, and that shows me right there, it is not a game I feel I need. I'll play it again with some caveats to level the playing field, but would not reccomend the game to anyone considering the first game they play as determining the rating as veterans will sweep them away, knowing full-knowledge on how to win considering the scoring tiles they have and the ones showing.

a solid (but low interaction) game.  I worry that there aren't really multiple paths to victory; I find myself only every winning when I follow a particular path -- that's not terrible, but it's too bad.

When playing the physical version, bookkeeping becomes a nightmare, and I would only rate the game a 4-5.  However, with the digital app the game is pleasing and interesting.  In person, the time spend checking your books could easily dominate actual decisions.

Rating after two four-player games at BGG.CON 2012.  This was my favorite new game of the con.  The Sim City Card Game DNA is readily apparent and made me pine a bit for that old, odd game.

One of our all time favorite games.  We love city-building, and this game does it extremely well.  Each of the tiles have such good synergies and combinations.  We have probably played this game 50 times.  We don't play it a whole lot anymore since we have a lot of new games that we are played, but we would still be happy to play it absolutely any time.  The only issue we have is that the goals are worth so many points that you can't possibly ignore them and win the game.  So they really force your hand, particularly in a 2 player game where you are in direct competition over each goal.  This bothers Jeff more than me, though, as I really like goal-oriented games. We have played with Suburbia Inc as well, and really enjoy the new tiles that change things up.

15-04-2015. I have now played it 7 times (all 2 player with my GF) and I still like Suburbia. I do feel it hits the table not enough recently though. I feel like the tiles and interactions make the game relatively high maintenance.

01-02-2014. It has been a while since last playing Suburbia (like 1 week or so). I've played it 4 times so far and I like it a lot. I like how the tiles interact and make your opponents side of the table interesting..

Somehow I like playing tiles and getting resources. I enjoy building the economic engine necessary for this game.

Definitely one of our top five favorite games. While each player builds his/her own borough or suburb one tile at a time next to a city, each player's decisions affect every other player. This is a game with a lot of interaction between the players. Random goals for each player that change every game keep the game fresh, exciting and force you to play differently each time you sit down. If you like all this and a theme similar to SimCity, then try Suburbia.

This is a great game - if you liked Sim City, you'll like this.  I actually never liked that Sim City never ended and this is great because it does...then you can start all over again!  It actually works better at 2-3 player than 4, not because of length, but just because it is really hard to keep track of 4 boroughs and you do need to keep track of what others are doing.  (JW)

I'm really enjoying this game. Tile laying game that feels a lot like Vegas Showdown in gameplay but without the auction. More player interaction between tiles and competing for goals, but this does require some time spent keeping track of tiles you have that may score when other tiles are played in the future (I like to put a $1 coin on those tiles and just go through them every time I or another player plays a tile). Thematically, you do feel like your building a city and deciding whether you will have lots of industry or residential or lakes etc, although perhaps you don't get the same nice aesthetic you get from a finished Carcassonne board. Probably best as a 3p game, but works quite well 2p (which Vegas Showdown does not) and the solitaire game is quite good with the bot rules (search for the Jule variant for more challenge).  I haven't tried 4p yet - there might be a bit too much book-keeping and you might feel more screwed by the luck of the draw - (in the 2nd half of the game, it seems like players are often buying the new tile that just came out on the far left of the track, so there is a large luck of the draw factor if the right tile come up for you). It would be cool if you could pay a little (like $2) to look at the top face-down tile in the current stack and can then buy it instead of another tile for $10 + the tile cost (or if you don't want it or can't afford it, put it back on the stack and buy a different tile for the normal cost) - I might try this variant.

I usually wait for quite a few plays before rating a game, but I am doing a bunch of ratings at the moment. Nevertheless I have played 6 games, the last 4 with Inc expansion, which I already think greatly improves it and is very important for the ultimately replayability.
By the way, just out of interest, I came across Galaxy Trucker and Suburbia as a result of studying the highly rated games by Race for the Galaxy devotees (ie 10/10), as I also consider RFTG as possibly the very best game, but do wish to maintain variety in gaming. This approach seems to have worked.
20170326; Am decreasing rating .1, because, after now playing perhaps 12 or so games, I am convinced that the goals are too highly valued such that they over-ride most other considerations. If all the goals were worth 5 less, I think it would make a lot of difference, allowing at least some consideration of possible powerful moves which may slightly compensate the loss of a goal. I don't think we have had a single win from anyone who did not score the most goals - the best we have had is to be within a few points of the highest goal scorer. And this not infrequently causes a degeneration into a goal race, such as the game today where for the most part we were simply racing to pickup greens and borders as goals. My opponent had opportunities for clever play on his last turn, but simply had to pick up a lake border on the last turn as losing the goal to me was worth 2 or 3 points more.

A solid game. Simple, to-the-point in mechanics, Analytical in its gameplay. 

The game is a tableau-builder with simple market mechanic. Each round, you pay for one tile from the market that gets cheaper the farther along it stays on the market. It is not only easy to deny people of their choice pieces, it may benefit you well if timed properly as you flip the piece on its back side to place a lake in your borough. 

The game rewards long-term planning, having clear phases where you first develop your engine and subsequently transit your purchases to point generation. The trick then is to find that balance, and knowing when to step on the gas without hurting yourself at the end. 

Would like to try with Suburbia Inc. next time.

RATING: 6
+ Can be fun to figure out the optimal position and timing for the developments in your suburb. 
+ The variety of goals encourage players to explore a variety of strategies, giving you slightly different things to think about with every game. 

- The goals sometimes come out in combinations that force the gameplay to become distorted and boring (like getting into a lake-building race). 
- Private goals sometimes cause large, unexpected swings during endgame scoring, and as a result I usually feel blasé no matter what the final outcome is.
- Every turn, there can be a lot of bookkeeping and a lot of different tiles to check, but it becomes somewhat more routine with repeated plays.
- Artwork is utilitarian and rather cold.

The perfect game for a lazy Sunday afternoon, played with a friend or two.

Only played two 3-player games so far, each time with new people. The game is very easy to grasp, while it takes sometime to get accustomed to all the symbols - people seem to confuse income with money and sometimes miscalculate the usefulness of some tiles - but all that comes with knowing the game and knowing what kind of tiles are going to be available later on (possibly available - as not all tiles are ever used).

I also very much like the goals (public and personal) and feel like this really makes the game. People are trying to beat each other for the bonus points, which is where the actual competition comes into play - in what is otherwise a very relaxed and non-confrontational tile laying game.

So far played with casual/non-gamers as well as proper gamer gamers, both parties have liked the game in equal measures, there is enough interesting decisions to make, and the complexity is somewhat hidden to not intimidate the casual gamers.

Update 1:
Now played a few more games, including several 2 player games (not played with 4 players yet). Even with just two players the game retains its interesting qualities. The goals are slightly easier to control and the market place is more predictable as there is only 1 person to compete against, but I don't feel like these hurt the base game that much. Prefer it with more players, but it is my go-to 2-player game at this point.

Simple drafting of city tiles that complement each other well and produce a good income flow early and points later on. It's fiddly as you add your tiles checking for all the points, income and reputation fluctuations dependent on other tiles. Easy enough to pick up and play quickly, yet it doesn't feel that tense even when you're competing head to head with another player for big bonus tiles. After a few turns, when your city is starting to really take form, the drafting seems to be a bit obvious as to what you should buy or bury (by turning into a lake or purchasing a base tile). It's all designed so that games should be close. Fun theme. It's okay, but not very exciting when it comes down to it. I think I prefer Irondale in the city building genre for a bit more interaction and choice, and Pax Porfiriana or Civilization: Through The Ages for tough card drafting choices. Not a bad way to spend an hour though.

Suburbia, City Tycoon, Urban Sprawl, Ginkgopolis, Urbania... so many city building games in such a short time. None of them seem to have quite cracked it yet, but I've got a few more to try.

------------------

A definite improvement with further play. There's more interaction that I thought at first. The tile drafting costs mesh together well with the income focused beginning moving to VP generation timing. Money is not so hard to come by (which is good), and so you see buildings of all costs and drafting positions being bought and buried.

My main complaint is the points seem to be very evenly matched, except the bonus tiles, where the difference between one player drawing a 15 pointer and another a 20 pointer is enough to decide the game.

This game took several plays for me to finally get, but now it's really one of my favorites. Perfectly thematic, it really feels like a board game version of SimCity. Really interesting drafting and push-your-luck kind of elements, nice tension with managing your income and reputation, trying not to grow too fast... just such a beautiful and elegant design.

After just one play I enjoyed the game - there is little 'on board' interaction as each player has their own suburb to build, however the choice of tile each time can have an effect on other players. 
I do like games which will be different each time you play: the goals are different and the tiles will be different and will enter play at different times. 
Easy to miss some income/reputation points when you first play but that would diminish as you play more games.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting interconnected game between your tiles and tiles of other players. The theme kinda fits the game of building a city, though the market doesn't seem right, and feel its mostly there to give options for the current turn than just randomly pulling tiles from the bag like Carcassonne.

Keeping track of bonus tiles can become a challenge towards the end of the, especially if 1 tile triggers 2-3 others. The game should of included cubes or some other mechanism to help identify these trigger tiles.

A good city building/drafting game. It took me several games to figure this one out, and a few bad play experiences gave me a less favorable view of the game initially.

I enjoy the game but two things don't quite live up to my expectations: (1) The feeling of accomplishment of building a city is diminished because the graphics on the tiles are primarily devoted to giving game information while the city-scape graphics are very simple, washed out, and very much a secondary consideration. (2) The primary focus of the game is finding the right balance between population and economy which makes building a beautiful or sensibly designed city unimportant and often pretty much impossible. The players are thinking first and foremost about what tile and placement are going to give the best results to their population and economy tracks. What makes a pleasing city doesn't really enter into the equation.

Great city building game with just about the right play time. I have played this with 2 players the most but also with 4 enough times to rate that experience as well. I prefer it with 2 but I appreciate how 4 changes the game just enough with different values on certain tiles and less ability to buy the exact tiles you want.

The SimCity to California's The Sims. Draft tiles with money, place it nicely in your area for maximum benefit. Nice job with the theme but meh, I don't really enjoy tracking what my opponents have done with their own hexagonal puzzle and small text on each edge for adjacency bonuses and penalties (or for others to AP it out). I'd rather the puzzle be simpler so we can focus more on interaction.

The speed bump on your income and reputation tracks if you blast out the gates early also seems to be a bit of a tacked-on catchup mechanism.

It's a MPS puzzly thingy of sorta tableau building style (tiles, cards - same thing). Stuff you've seen before: public market of tiles (new ones being more expensive), individual player boards, goals (common and individual), getting many points in many different ways. It doesn't move as fast as drafting games, but it's in that general league with 7 Wonders and Amongst the Stars. 

But makes 1 thing better than all the competition: narrative. Not only it's pretty good in building yourself something genre (and relatively short). It also makes for interesting stories if you think musings about social classes and urbanism are fun (tee hee hee): [i]hey I've build retirement village next to fast food and population skyrocketed. [/i] Or putting that social housing project in the far away part of town, behind the large lake. 

EDIT - in hindsight I like the theme and general flow of the game, but find some parts too gamey and needlessly complicated.

An alright city-building game which is much simpler and more thematic than its bureaucratic appearance lets on. At its core, it's all about optimising the purchase and placement of the right tiles. There are, however, public and secret goals which will influence your choice of tiles. The "speed bumps" along the VP track also require players to build up a steady income before powering through the bumps towards the end.

While I don't have any major issues with the game, there are several nitpicks which gradually add up. Most prominently, it gets increasingly fiddly to optimise remaining moves while keeping track of building effects to be triggered. There's also the minor snag of luck in the tile draws – buildings which depend on specific tiles appearing (airports, offices and the like) can be notoriously underpowered if the right tiles don't appear in the pool.

RATING: 7.5
This was on my list to buy, but I probably won't now that I have played it. It's not because I don't like the game, because I REALLY do like it. Like Legacy: Gears of Time, it has simple mechanisms, but lots of strategic game play. HOWEVER, the constant bookkeeping necessary while playing is VERY distracting. We had a 5th person doing nothing but that during a 4 player game and it still took a couple hours to play. I have decided to wait for the iOS version of Suburbia that has been announced to get and play since it will handle all of the bookkeeping and enable the players to focus more on the actual game. Plus, there have been some production issues with the printed version of the game evident in the copy I was playing and that bothers me, especially at that price point.

I have played Suburbia several times and it's fun, but I could see it feeling samey after a bit. It's a neat game overall, solo play is a bonus, but the tiles are a cut a bit off-centered in every copy I've seen (this kind of thing bothers me), there is a lot of fiddly bookkeeping that's necessary during the game, and even though there are various strategies, it isn't overly deep. It does a good job of replicating the SimCity feel and I like it, but I recommend that people try it before buying, if possible, because I'm not quite sure it's worth the money. They already have an expansion in the works that will add some new mechanisms to the game, but I'm not sure it's necessary. I think I'm more excited about getting and playing the iOS version of the game once it gets released rather than owning the physical board game.

Awesome game, scales well from two to four players. Theres a lot going on in this game that's geared better towards experienced gamers.

Deceptively deep! This game has a lot going on in terms of strategies you can pursue and how the scoring pans out. Some people feel the end game goals are too 'swingy' - they are, but this is a factor that a good player will take into account by assuming their opponents have goals which can gain them 20 points and planning around this by chasing the public goals and ensuring that their own private goals are met.

The expansion, Suburbia Inc adds a fun element of direction in terms of new challenges to accomplish as adding borders which alter how your tableau develops. I am a fan of both tile laying and tableau building,and find Suburbia an excellent implementation of both mechanics. A very good game

I tried this solo on iPad and liked it enough to pick up a trade copy. Need to get this to the table or get rid of it.

Update: played 3p finally, I think it's a keeper for us. A somewhat rare occurrence for me where playing the digital version hasn't ruined the analog version for me; more fun playing for real, which was a little unexpected because there's sort of a lot of bookkeeping in this which I'd normally find fiddly for playing it in person. Instead, we all enjoyed puzzling out the best pieces to buy and how to build out our boroughs.

I think this is a fun city-building game, but it has two major flaws:

1.) The buildings Casino and PR-Firm are overpowered if they come out early in the game. They should be removed, as they meddle with the inherent balancing mechanisms of Suburbia.

2.) The (personal) goals are much too important. Often the luck of the draw will simply prevent you from achieving a goal. Goals are almost always game deciding, due to the huge amount of points they provide. If all players simply need to fulfill their personal goals to be able to win, then they are poorly designed. I personally like the idea of goals but the amount of points they provide needs to be toned down a lot.

Update: After eagerly anticipating The Castles of Mad King Ludwig by the same designer, it seems that it has the exact same problem with the personal goals (maybe even more so), especially for low player counts ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Suburbia is hands down one of the most fun games I have ever played. Building a city and having to keep track of what other people are building is perfect for keeping everyone involved on game night. I would say that the only problem I have with the game is that some of the tiles seem much better and almost broken in certain players hands. The game will let you turn tiles into lakes to mitigate that, but in my group rarely is someone looking to bring another player down like that. Overall though a great game to put on your shelf.

A King Ludwig óta nagyon vártam, hogy kipróbálhassam az elődöt, mert a témája sokkal közelebb állt hozzám, mint az utódé és nem is csalódtam. Várost építünk, lakó, üzleti és ipari negyedekkel, amiket parkokkal, kikapcsolódási zónákkal színesítünk. Célunk, hogy minél többen jöjjenek hozzánk és lakjanak nálunk, ehhez pedig körönkénti bevételünket is szinten kell tartani, hisz ebből építjük az épületeket. Körönként a már több játékban ismert mechanizmussal tudunk lapkát szerezni, azaz elsők olcsóbbak, a következők plusz pénzbe kerülnek. Pénzhiány esetén a szerzett épületek tóvá alakíthatók, amik így ingyen vehetők el és azonnali pénzt hoznak. Kőkemény euró létére nagyon tematikus a játék. Az épületek egymásra hatnak a játék közben, amire nem könnyű a figyelés, mert játékostársaink épületei által is változhatnak a városunk értékei. A játékban van 4 nyílvános cél, ami a játék végén 10-20 lakót hoz a városnak és mindenki a játék elején két-két titkos célból választ. Én kicsit soknak tartom az ez által szerezhető laókat. Így azért erre különösen érdemes figyelni. Nagyon tematikus, hogy ahogy egyre többen laknak a városunkban úgy egyre nehezebb új városlakókat magunkhoz csábítani és a fenntartási költségeink is nőnek. A játék vége nem fix, ez általában nem tetszik de jól működik. Első játékomban teljesen más stratégiák mentén a három újonc 8 ponton belül végzett. Kicsit talán lehetett volna szebb a grafika. Elsőre erős 7-es, ha sikerül még játszanom vele emelkedhet a pontszám.

Suburbia is an excellent tile-placement, city building game with loads of tough decisions and tactical strategy. The rules, though, are quite simple. You take turns drafting tiles to put into your city, trying to get the best reputation and lure people into your little hamlet. While the game scales fairly well, I prefer it with two. Going through the effects of each tile can get quite overwhelming the larger your town gets, particularly if you have to check the towns of three other players. There are also a couple of tiles that are a bit too strong for my liking (the Casino & PR Firm), but there is enough variety to just remove them. Overall, Suburbia is a great game for those that are just stepping past the beginner or gateway level games.

Great city-building euro.

The artwork is a bit bland but I love the thematic nature of the different city-tiles. They all work as you would imagine.

The scoreboard has a wonderful feature that, when your cross one of red lines, your income and reputation both drop by 1, representing the increase of bureacracy in your city. You need to be more and more effecient to keep yout city going.

Also, I love how easy it is to teach. The rulebook is short, everything makes sense, and that makes it uneccessary to re-read the rules if you haven't played in a long time.

I have only played the game with 2-3 players and I fear that you would loose to much control with which tiles are avaiable to you with 4.


I have one gripe with game though: The goals. First of all I'm not sure they are totally balanced (although I believe it's more pronoucned in The Castles of Mad King Ludwig). Secondly and even more annoying, are the public goals. If you play a 3 player game, the goals that give you VP's for having less tiles of a specfific color than the other players, leads to a sort of king making. 

Let me explain:
A nonspecific public goal in a given game gives a player 15 VP's if they have the fewest yellow tiles in their borough at the end of the game. In a 3 player game it now becomes a race for whoever gets a yellow tile first, so he or she has one more than the others. Why? Because now the other players cannot aqquire any yellow tiles unless they want to give 15 points to the remaining player. maybe it's a case of group-think, but it just rubs me the wrong way.

This is a good city building game, but the theme is a bit too dry for my tastes. It also feels like it goes a lot longer than it should due to the slow tile movement and long downtime.

These mechanics would benefit from a re-theme or re-skin, I think.

DH likes this one a little better than Mad King.  I prefer Mad King, but they are both really good tile layers.  It's nice to earn the money from the "tiles" that you buy instead of relying on the other players like in Mad King.

Great tile-laying game. While a little fiddly from having to compute the effects of a played tile with the ones surrounding it, it's not too bad and in fact makes the game have interesting choices. I love the sense of how your city grows. The objectives provide a great way to channel the direction of what you are trying to do and vary up gameplay. Finally, the tiles themselves are quite thematic to make this just a soldi game.

Easy rules, (few rules as well), plays very smothly. Interesting decisions. I also like the tile laying aspect and the (pretty unique) mixture between personal hidden goals and open public goals. In short: a very good game!

Suburbia is a board game version of SimCity. For that reason I enjoy it more than I would otherwise. On the one hand, it's a fiddly optimization game with individual player boards in the same vein as Power Grid: Factory Manager. On the other, there are several opportunities for parasitism and screwing your neighbour. Luck plays a role in the result, and with all the secret objectives, it might feel a bit random, but it's not as coldly calculable as other games in the same genre. I don't like suburban development at all, but I like Suburbia. See also Castles of Mad King Ludwig, which I might like a bit more.

A game that I'd wanted to play for a while, in fact I heard of it not long after I started pursuing the hobby. However, it took a while to get that first play and having got Castles of Mad King Ludwig in the meantime Suburbia now feels a little irrelevant for me. Deeper and more tactical, but to me some of the strengths of CMKL are based around the lighter aspect of the game. I won't be rushing back for another play.

RATING: 6.5
This is a tile-laying city-building economic game for 2-4. It's sort of SimCity, in board game form (but no monsters - yet)! The rules are very thematic, so that you end up designing a city that more or less makes sense and fits with what you expect a city to look like. Thanks to varying end game bonuses (objectives) and the fact that only a subset of tiles are used each game, every game should be different. 

Game play is fun, but there are several annoying elements:
- having to count the number of specific tiles in play in ANY players' cities
- having to track everyone's progress towards all the objectives
- some buildings, like the PR Firm and the Casino, seem VERY powerful (overly so)
- the way that the (semi)randomly distributed goals and face up goals sometimes get distributed (e.g., some people facing incompatible goals, or goals that happen to match perfectly) 

I think I'll like it better with fewer players; and probably best on the iPad!

--- Summary ---
 The central board has:
- 7 face-up tiles in a row which, in Showmanager style, are available for purchase by paying the tile's base cost plus an additional cost that rises as you get further back in the line. 
- several additional copies of the starting tiles, also available for purchase (if bought, the player still discards one of the 7 face-up tiles)
- 3 groups of tiles (A, B, C), which are the Stock from which to replenish the supply line of tiles. They are also the game timer: an end-of-game tile is shuffled into the bottom portion of the C deck. When this tile comes up, finish that round AND ONE MORE, then the game ends.
- several end-game objective tiles, chosen at random (the single player achieving each objective will score the indicated VP)
Each player starts with
- the same set of tiles, creating a little city with income (cash earned each turn) and reputation (population, or VP, earned each turn)
- cash
- 2 personal, secret goal tiles (for end-game VP): after seeing the public objectives, keep ONE of them

On your turn, buy a tile (you do have the option to reduce the base cost to $0 if you buy it face down, as water) and place it in your city. Then, apply the effects printed on the tile you placed AND any other related tile on your or any other players' boards. Tiles may give you cash (e.g., earn $2 when some tiles are adjacent to water), or modify your income or reputation; or they may modify the effect of other tiles (e.g., every restaurant in play increases the income bonus of every farm in play by $1). Income and reputation are tracked on your personal board. 

At the end of your turn, gain/lose cash (based on income) and population (based on reputation, and tracked on the score board). As your pop increases, you'll cross one or more red lines; for each line crossed, you must reduce your income and rep by 1. Replenish the tiles available for purchase by sliding them to fill in the gap, and adding a new tile from the (A, B, or C) stack of city tiles to the back of the line.

At the end of the game, players earn VP for:
- goals: the public objectives and their private objective, if they are the ONLY player to achieve the goal.
- money: each $5 buys 1 pop
Most VP wins (tiebreakers: rep, then income, then remaining cash)!

I went back and forth quite a bit in my head about this game.  The initial press blurbs and tidbits I heard about this game intrigued me.  "Sim City as a board game" was the biggest one that piqued my interest.

Then I read a full review in Spielbox about this game and my interest waned quite a bit.  It was a positive review but the way they portrayed it made it seem a little too light for me.

Then a close friend of mine showed up to game night with his brand new copy and I had to find out first-hand, and I'm glad I did because it completely changed my mind back.  This is a very fun and very well-designed game.  It is certainly on the lighter side of things, but in all the right ways.  It isn't overly convoluted and it is certainly easy and quick to teach new players.  But there's also a decent amount of variety both in the tiles and the game mechanics that there is a lot of strategic and tactical thinking to consider.  I also love the mechanic of having a hidden private goal to strive for in addition to the public goals everyone has knowledge about.

I got demolished my first game because I tried to play the system and completely miscalculated.  Building up income and money early and filling my town with the tiles necessary to take the majority of the goals and then switching gears to focus entirely on population (this game's 'victory points') when I thought it was the "end-game".  Unfortunately the game lasted quite a few more rounds than I expected and I found myself with no income or money to buy the expensive end-game buildings and the mechanic of crossing red lines that lower both income and reputation meant my end-game sprint resulted in me not collecting population consistently any more either.

There's a lot of interaction between the tiles which I love, you can even interact with tiles in other players' burroughs.  And the interactions make sense thematically.  For example, a slaughterhouse lowers your reputation by quite a bit but gives you more income based on the number of restaurants nearby.  This is actually quite a thematic game overall and the different mechanics make logical sense and are original and fun, like the above mentioned "red lines".  As your city grows in population you lose income for the upkeep.  The loss of reputation they describe as losing "small town" status and is a little wonky but I guess the theme can't be completely perfect.

My only complaint is the same as with any game like this, where most of the gameplay comes from the interaction of the different elements, the city tiles in this case.  With a finite number of tiles, eventually the best ones and the best combos become apparent and games devolve into competition for those best lines of play (which can sometimes be way too dependent on "luck of the draw"). Although expansions are assuredly planned for this game to extend its life.  It can also become a bit difficult to remember in all the ways you need to make adjustments when a new tile is added later in the game.

Played once with 2, once with 3. I can NOT find the fun in this game. The choices seem bland and predictable most of the time, and the constant need to watch for buildings that score non-adjacently is tiring. This game actually makes Suburban Sprawl seem fun by comparison.

In Suburbia players play some kind of board Sim City. There are yellow (industrial), grey (cultural), green (residential) and blue (comercial) types of buildings. There are also lakes, that work more like a plan B action. All of these tiles appear on gameplay divided in 3 decks (A, B and C) thus trying to make some sense of evolution, and they are bought by players and placed in player's displays, forming a pattern of hexagons on different colors that are supposed to represent blocks of certain activities. In the end, what players want is to increase population on the city and accomplish some goals (having more money, being the player with more or less income, have more residential/cultural/comercial buildings), you name it! Every goal and its opposite should be in the game. All of this is very, or all, more than abstract.
The action mechanism is quiet simple and that is an advantage for the game. Players select one tile from a row (the more the tile is new the most expensive it gets) and apply it into his city activating it. The activation is made with symbols that represent population, income and popularity. This representation is color coded and simple to understand too but still only a pattern of tiles.
And players go round after round, buying tiles (buildings) that when placed closed to others give more or less benefits, depending on each one's abilities. Simple but also boring. And also boring is the non-sense of grow when displaying a tile. I had no such feeling of growth. Even when you get more advantages depending on a number of 'green tiles' you have on your display, or 2 money for each 'grey tile', that's not enough for the city building feeling, in my opinion.
In the end, this isn't a bad game. But it isn't a very good one too. Because it had so much more potential and it could be so much more interesting to play. And it has one of those lazy solutions on scoring (bonus tiles) that are related to everything you come to do in the game, even some that you didn't choose to: the player with the most income can win 15VP's in the end, but so can the player with the least income, for example. And these bonus tiles, in the end, can mean more than 30% of all the hard work one had during play. I can play it occasionally.

Enjoyable city building with tiles game. Thought provoking, humorous and nicely produced. Rule book not great. For a own tableau  game it manages to be interactive. The 'every' and 'all other borough' tiles require players to keep their heads up and watching each others neighbourhoods.

It feels a little like Glen More, but I find the spatial element a little more thematic, the interaction and the possibility for negative draft more interesting.

Suburbia is one of my absolute favorite Euro games.  It combines a fun theme with interesting mechanics and is dreadfully simple to learn but difficult to master.  This makes it an extremely fun game each and every time I play it.  I especially like that you will only see on average about half the tiles in any given stack every time you play.  You never know if you will see a lot of airports or restaurants come out and will have to adjust your strategy accordingly.  I've even had people tell me that it replaces SimCity for them.

The one thing keeping this from being a 10 is that I have won every single game I have played of it so far, and I've played 6.  This has made me grow a little bored of the game, because I don't like to play games where I'm always winning.  It's not even like I'm playing bad opponents; one of the people I play this with usually wins 70% of all the other games we play.  However, he can't seem to get this game at all, even when he had no problem understanding the rules to Twilight Imperium or Arkham Horror.  Once I start getting some better competition and lose a game or two, I'm sure it will become a 10.  However, if I continue to win with ease, it may drop as my interest in playing drops.

EDIT:  yup, the latter. I'll still play this if people request it, but it's not as fun as it once was because I seem to always win. I may have to see if adding the expansion helps.

Best tile laying game I've played outside of the 18xx world. 

Takes the relatively narrow decision space of Carcassone, and turns it into a real strategy game.  

Components are nice and easy to use. Game was easy to learn, with a few rules questiosn.  Enjoyed the manuals in-depth description of each tile - in case there was confusion.

Most of the game you are trading income for population, while managing current cash.  

Theme felt solid.  Many of the buildings felt like real buildings, and I was working hard to keep the power plants out of the business disctrics and what not.

Nice blend of strategy and tactics.

This is the only city building game that I have in my collection, and it is one that I enjoy very much.

Love it.

For the life of me, I cannon understand how this game is rated so highly.  Although the mechanics are sound, the aesthetics of this game are severely lacking.  Why make a game where tiles laying in someone else's tableau affect your scoring if you can't read what's in the opponents tableau?  No significant marking is included on the tiles which makes them suddenly readable at the other end of your gaming table.

This game suffers so badly from terrible graphic design that it detract from what could have been a very, very good game.  While I could have agreed with the rating on this game otherwise, I cannot give it a high rating as it sits.

I want to like this game, BUT....
the money aspect of the game is a bit to hard and makes it a bit to much about money instead of being about building a nice little suburb. 

I find the artwork could be a little nicer, it doesn´t feel like your building a restaurant, more like just taking a blue tile. For me, this game would have increased in rating if there were a little more sillyness to the tiles - more like Castles of mad king Ludwig. 

It is also a bit to long for what it provides.

Initially was very impressed, but the goals seem to be a little imbalanced with 2 players -- they can really swing the game and can be determined solely by the luck of the market. I think this game has less long-term strategic planning in it than people make it out to have. That doesn't mean we don't enjoy it, but it's a bummer when the game is won based on a single goal and whose turn it was when a particular tile comes into the market.

The first time I played this game it felt a little "dry." But a week later I was still thinking about it...that doesn't happen often. My love for it grows with each subsequent play and while I lose more then I win, I still have fun trying! 

However, I am thinking that my rating for this might fall as I play more Ora Et Labora and Keyflower as those seem to be very similar.

A bit tricky to rate and will need another play or two to solidify.  

Love the theme and how integrated the theme is with the play.

The iconography is way to small with far too much hex space given over to the mediocre artwork.  That needs to shrink by 50% so that the interactions can be easier to read from across the table.  The actual iconography is extremely poor as well--I cannot emphasize that enough--yet would have been so simple to fix.  For instance the difference between a positive shift in income and a negative one is a .5 point red line around the circle and an illegibly small minus sign which might even be completely hidden by ink bleed.  Really?  you don't even need a minus sign--make the number bigger, make the circle a solid red for negative, solid black for positive and you're done.

This is the type of game I like to play slowly, watching other players as they pull off their cool combos, playing my turn carefully so that I don't overlook anything, and having the other players watching what I'm doing so that they can be all impressed by the amazing moves I'm pulling off (and to double-check that I'm not screwing anything up!).  In that context, this is a pretty enjoyable experience for me.  The first play of a game like this tends to be a little overwhelming as you're trying to figure out how everything works together, but some basic familiarity with the game also makes the experience more enjoyable.  I like that there's a decent amount of player interaction for a tableau-building-style-type of game.  I wasn't totally sure what to think of the art/graphic design and its almost childish, cartoony look, but I've decided that in a game like this, being able to see a lot of things at a glance is of the highest priority.  Thus, functionality wins out over beauty in this case.  As a whole, there's a fun game here, but nothing to blow me away.  Also, I'll take the PR Firm over the Casino any day.

Purchase tiles from a Through the Ages-style row and add them to your city, getting benefits from the tile itself as well as those adjacent or even in other players' boroughs. It's all very thematic, if blandly illustrated: if you build a heavy factory you increase your income, but you don't want housing adjacent to your industrial zone or you'll lose reputation. Airports go up in value with each new airport built by anyone. If you build a fancy restaurant, it's worth a lot at the start, but as competitors open up your income decreases. Many of the later buildings are marvelously cynical.

The degree and depth of these synergies makes the game more interesting than somewhat similar titles like Glen More. Much of the strategy comes from targeting the randomly-selected public and private goals (most houses, most reputation, most money etc.), which are worth significant points.

There's masses of interplay variability, with many tiles (both cities and goals) not included in the mix for any given game; the flipside is a very real luck factor. Hope you get the right building at the right time! Early decisions have very uncertain payoff: memorizing the tiles doesn't help as much as it could because not all tiles are included. That airport isn't such a good deal if none of the rest come out! Private goals can also be frustratingly out of your control. If you take the "fewest green buildings (+20)" goal and another player doesn't build a green at all, there is nothing you can possibly do to influence that. 

It's also a game that doesn't seem to gain much except time from adding players; the sweet spot is probably 2-3.

I enjoy the game but it offers just [i]slightly[/i] too little control to be a favourite.

Great theme play.  Fairly easy to learn, but easy to play.  Some player interaction.  Only gripe so far is the way the game ends.  Game has a variable ending so players don't know how many turns are left which really limits options available to players.

I thought for sure when I first saw the uninspired "art" that this game would be similarly dull, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. I liked a game about city planning! That in itself is kind of a design triumph. The tiles were very well linked to the theme, even though it seemed  odd to score off what my opponents owned. I liked the public and secret goals, and the simultaneous income and reputation tracks, but I found the punishment of passing the red line unnecessary and annoying. There may be a runaway leader problem. I would play it again, but I'm not sure with so many other new and classic games grabbing my attention that I would ever suggest it.

As of this rating, this game is rated lower than Castles of Mad King Ludwig, which is almost criminal.

The great: It's thematically tight to an extent I haven't seen since Agricola. The minimalist design is visually appealing. The pieces minimize text effectively. The game moves briskly. The goal system rewards flexibility, and the cash/income system rewards strong planning and tactical soundness. The income-loss system helps prevent runaway leaders. The randomness of available buildings can significantly alter the tempo and decisions from game to game.

The not-so-great: It's very easy to miss something and lose track of your cash/income/reputation, which causes scoring issues to the extent that it's very challenging to score a full game correctly. The goals' outsized rewards can push the luck impact too high. The randomness in game end-time seems intended to prevent "timing" the endgame, but often leads to one or more players simply hoping for an early/late end to the game.

The verdict: I have never failed to enjoy a play of this game. It plays light but with depth, and appeals to a broad audience.

Game works great it is that I just really disliked this game.  It feels very euro and to me the theme seems just layered only.  To me  I need a theme that is very interwoven and I like to make a plan and watch it come together and I cannot do this in this game and that is why it is not for me

As good as you can get for a Sim City adaptation on a board. A few minor gripes with certain bonus tiles especially the lowest money or reputation which are not strategic but lead to dumping in the last few rounds. Would always want to play with simple turn order auction variant wherever possible.

Really enjoyed my first few games of this. Starts out simple and becomes a little complicated towards the middle of the game before exploding into full on AP inducing calculation by the end. The amount of stuff going on means that the final scores feel a little like estimates as keeping track of all the scoring possibilities can be a real hassle, but this doesn't affect my enjoyment.

Definitely feels like a city building game. It is fun and definitely has a good engine building system, but loses points for a lot of the fiddliness and clunkiness of some systems. Keeping track of all the different conditions is maintenance heavy and definitely detracts from the game. The losing income and reputation when passing certain population tracks is a bit double handed... it rewards building a long term engine over a short time gain. Not necessarily bad, but does feel like it limits some strategic paths.

Some improved suggestions would be: The tiles that have global bonuses need to be highlighted more. Additionally, the end game tile being shuffled into the last 9 makes the last turn fairly random, especially when a lot of the last tiles are so powerful and can turn a game around.

Just played our second full game of this with my wife.  The final score was: Wife 62 points, daughter 60 points, and I had the highest score I have had with 166. It is one of our 10X10 challenge  games, but most of our plays have been me playing solo or playing solo with my daughter on my "team".  

My wife loves Sim City and I thought for sure this would be a hit.  Looks like I was wrong.  She really doesn't like the struggle to earn money and is also turned off by the reduction of income and reputation when passing the red lines.  I think creating your engine is a selling point of the game and the red line is needed to help slow down someone from running away with the game.

Oh well...looks like the last three games of the challenge will be solo games and then it's off to the trade pile.

Tile laying game where you buy and build an income engine in the form of various city developments. Derivative and overly procedural, it feels like it lacks some form of snappy innovation, some extra mechanic to really bring everything together. Unfortunately it feels less than the sum of its parts. Sold after two plays.

At first I thought I loved it. After playing a few times, however, I found that my norm of not enjoying tile games holds true.

There just seems too much luck involved.  Sure I enjoy games with more luck, like the card based game of Ashes, but winning that game seems to take more consideration of each turn than it does in suburbia.

I feel like my biggest complaint is the goal tiles.  You have no idea what hidden goal your opponent has unless you can guess based on their actions, which isn't always easy.  I love hidden goals in some games, but the point swing it can give you at the end of the game is deflating.  I want to win my euro games based on me outsmarting someone, not losing because they built more lakes than me.

Suburbia is basically Sim City: The Board Game. You get income from your city, buy buildings, and strategically add them to your town to maximize your profits and reputation.

It does get a little slow late-game. There's a plot of slow point calculation in this game--every tile you put down might affect every tile around it, and might get bonuses based on not just *your* board, but from tiles placed by ALL of the players. There's a lot of "Wait, how many residential tiles does everyone have?" and "How many restaurants do you have?" It's interestingly complex, but it does slow things down.

There's a nice self regulation mechanic to ensure that players dont get too far ahead, and there seems to be an inverse relationship between points and money, so players can only be strong in one area.

*sigh *

Just deeply deeply soulless. Build a money engine and then build a VP engine while the game has Power Grid-levels of subtle catch up mechanisms to ensure you don't pull too far away.

Oh, and hidden scoring tiles that are deeply random. "Oh, you happened to not build any of those tiles either? Well, then I can't score my twenty points. Ho-hum."

It's also deeply frustrating when a tile comes out that you want and you can see exactly what will happen - that it'll drop in price and then be gone by the time it comes back to you. Did you need that tile really badly? Too bad! I'm sure that is less of an issue with two or three players and if I'd liked the game more I'd have been more forgiving. I didn't so I'm not.

I'm rarely excited to play this, but every time I do, I think "this game is really great, I should play it more often." The rules overhead is low enough that you can teach it to anyone; play is smooth and elegant, it's really a triumph of game design.

It tells a really fun story, too. Every time I play, I end up smiling and laughing. This game has a sly sense of humor, despite its almost clinical appearance.

Probably the game I underrate most severely. It's really terrific.

I just don't know what I think of this game.  There are some things that I really like about this game, the feeling you get while playing, the object is well thought out, etc.  But there are some things I really don't like.  Those goal tiles are a huge swing, and the private goals are completely random.  Some can be incredibly easy to get, some are near impossible, some can even be out of your control completely.

Very strong theme, but beside that a standard tile placement game. 

I like the red lines - when you gain some amount of VP, you lose one income and VP / round, so it slow down your development. You must play to the end.

Suburbia is a tight game of city building that in many ways reminds me of a more elaborate version of a drafting game like [thing=66362]Glen More[/thing]. You have to choose a vision for your burgeoning suburb, and then try to fill it with synergistic buildings from a common tableau, all the while hoping that the other players don't choose the buildings you want. Of course like any game of its kind, keenly observing the other players is a must so that you know when to select a building that may not be ideal for your personal strategy, but that hurts the other player(s) enough to be worth the hate-draft.

As for what you are building, the joy of the game comes when you see your city grow before your eyes. It takes on a personality of its own depending on the type of buildings you install. Will you be an airport hub, a residential paradise, or a commercial powerhouse? All options. The game-play tension, however, comes in the form of balancing population growth (points) against income (money to buy future buildings). You can't have both, but of course you need both. The only way to overcome that typically zero-sum limitation is to look for positive interactions between the building you are buying and the buildings you (and your fellow players) have already built.

And this is where my criticism for the game comes in. If I fault the game anywhere it's in the elaborate checking and re-checking that you have to perform each round to see how your new building scores you bonuses. If you are playing with four people, for example, you not only need to check your own board, but also the boards of each opponent. This lends some much needed player interaction to the game, but it ultimately comes off as more chore than joy. While it can be satisfying to take advantage of someone else's hard work, those moments are less common than you might think. But still, it's easy enough to get into the habit. It doesn't interfere with the flow of the game so much as it create the feeling of a bookkeeping exercise.

I suppose my other criticism has to do with repeat plays. Because the game is quite good, it rewards experience. However, the game also falls into the trap of having set strategies that players can repeat over and over. This is mitigated by the random draw of tiles, but not by the actions of the other players. I would prefer the latter.

So overall, I find Suburbia a tight game that is also fun to play. The lack of true player interaction will prevent it from rising to the top of my ratings heap, but that doesn't mean I'm not impressed.

Sure, put that farm and slaughterhouse next to the middle school!

Something about creating something as you play game is very enjoyable. Especially when it is all yours. Game that have this mechanism that come to mind:

Agricola
Castles of Mad King Ludwig--which is Suburbia--the pre-quel.
The Castles of Burgundy
Dark Seas
7 Wonders--well, not really but sort of...
Alhambra

Suburbia can become a brainburner. Especially when you get to the "C" tiles. Which tile is the best value for my buck? Which tiles will I have a chance at next turn? Where would I put it? What goals could I still win?

Nice.

This might be the best city building game on the market.  I really like how the buildings synergize with each other.  I kind of wish the goals were less powerful, or there were fewer of them.  Especially the ones that are based on income or reputation, because those can be entirely influenced in the last few rounds and don't really dictate your strategy for most of the game.

A great game that I really like! I got hooked immediately after the first play and it got even better the second. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised as I love city building games ...or actually games where you have to kind of develop your own machinery, your own motor where all the parts have to fit into each other.

The game design and mechanism is in essence quite simple but manages to grab a hold of me in a very entertaining way! I leave the table with a feeling of having played a "big" game but in under two hours.

I had left this one on the shelf for a while, but after playing the excellent app again, it's come back with a vengeance. Suburbia is one of those rare games that manages to satisfy me after each play but want to come right back for more. Building a city is fun, and attempting to balance your needs while attempting to edge other players out of the goals is both challenging and engaging.

It's funny how the digital app solidified the physical game's place in my collection. Suburbia is a wonderful game, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Solid economic tile laying game. Offers tough decisions as far as what to buy when and making sure both of your engines (money and population aka victory points) are firing on all cylinders.

Suburbia seems to have some issues, especially in terms of balance. There are game-breaking, end-game tiles that basically render everything that has gone on before meaningless. Aside from balance issues, the game just didn't excite me ... it felt a bit drab, a little fiddly and more of a grind than a fun affair. Suburbia works as a game, but it's not one I had much fun playing.

In fact, the balancing mechanism - if it was meant to be balancing - screwed me, the player in the last place even more than the other two players ahead. Still a 5,because I had a feeling of citybuilding and not just placing green, grey, yellow or blue tiles

Build a city, keeping costs low and influx of residents high, and managing the spatial relationships between different kinds of buildings.

Suburbia simplifies city management and development down to a few easy to manage resources (money, income, population, and immigration) and has a ton of variability. It can be a little to easy to forget what you and your opponents have built in the first few plays, but after a while it becomes second nature.

A city building game accomplished via tile placement. The ruleset is pretty light. Overall, this is a pleasant game that isn't particularly demanding, but still offers some nice tactical depth. The random goals are a nice touch for replayability.

I suspect a 2 player game would allow for some added light strategy. In larger games, the tile selection for future turns is rather unpredictable.

I could see a common complaint regarding the bookkeeping, but for me it wasn't too bad. Though, everyone needs to pay attention or they might miss a benefit here or there.

A minor quibble I have is that the building specific artwork on the tiles is pretty bland.

I might have to lobby for this as a replacement for Alhambra down the road.

I was sort of committed for a while to only thinking this game was ok.  I think it was just such a benign theme (I hate the suburbs in real life so why on earth would I want to play a game about one?).  But here's the deal: it's exceptional.  I think it might be one of the finest designs I've every played.  The relationship between income, reputation, and overall population (score) is complex and exciting and difficult to master even after a few plays.  And the interaction between tiles within and between player tableaus is first-rate.  I can't speak highly enough of this game.  Get it, give it the due time to wrap your head around, and enjoy yourself.  It's just so good.

Wonderful components. Fascinating mechanics. Light but swell theme.

So why don't I like this game?

This is the type of game I'll never be good at it, and it somewhat wrecks my opinion of the game. Petty, I know, but there you have it.

I completely understand why people like it, including people in my group whom I value highly. But it's definitely not my first choice and I play it only under protest or in order to balance out game requests for the evening.

EDIT: All of that was useless so here's something productive - keeping track of what tile affects what is too difficult; huge runaway leader problem; plenty of times where you just have mediocre or bad decisions to make, stalling or stopping your progress.

RATING: 8
I love the Sim-City feel, the challenge of building up your income and reputation to overcome the late-game drops, the inherent catch-up provided by the red lines, but still rewarding good early-game decisions, and the multiple high-level strategies.

That said, it has a couple weaknesses: there should be more interactive elements (more restaurants and sky scrapers for example), the randomness of the goals (and the distribution of points for them) feels a little off...the luck of the tiles.  It all comes together to be a little more chaos than I want in a game of this complexity.

I still play it a lot, almost purely based on theme :)

This is the kind of game that allows you to play it with multiple intentions and all are equally enjoyable. You can either plan your city in a manner that makes a city make sense or try to win the game through buying the best tiles each turn.

A simple and elegant urban planning game.

I love games with simple rules and easy mechanics that have great depth and replaybility. It allows me to set-up, teach and play the game easily and spend my time making critical decisions and enjoying the game. Suburbia fits exactly this description. The classic drafting is supported so well with tile placement and set collection - thanks to some great tile design - that the end result is impressive. The game flows well, has tough decisions, requires planning ahead and creates a great sense of accomplishment.

There is little to dislike here, other than the artwork and the general production value. The game deserves much more in presantation. Other than that, the randomness of the tiles puts me slightly off, as I'd prefer to know for sure how many of the key combo buildings will be available in the future. 

Overall it's a fine game, perfect for urban planners.

RATING: 10
What I like:

-The quintessential city building game - a theme most folks can get behind
-Hits the playing time sweet spot
-A great balance between complex and intuitive for both new and experienced players
-Fun management of your city's Growth versus economics
-The way the market works creates some very interesting decisions
-High replay value with the many different tiles and strategies

What I dislike
Having played way over 100 games of this I feel that the goals are actually a bit too important. Once you realise this, the game almost becomes a race of chicken to see who is willing to crash and burn harder to get the goals. The otherwise amazing amazing expansion only increases this as it makes it easier to get a great city even while only focusing on the goals. There is no winning just by creating the best city - you need the goals and preferably most of them.

A fine enough city building game for what it is. It's faster and easier to teach to people than The Capitals. Honestly though as I like heavier games I do prefer The Capitals to Suburbia but it's not likely to hit the table as much so I feel there is room for both games in my collection.

RATING: 7
I like this game very much and the mechanics are really good. There is just one thing that bothers me and it sort of bothers me a lot: The goal is about getting the most populous suburb, but most strategies include just a minor number of residential buildings if any at all. And furthermore, these buildings are almost never built in the beginning of the game. So the question is "Where do all these people live in a city that mainly consists of offices, restaurants and industries?". There is a great chance that the airport (or even multiple airports) is built before there exists even a single residential block. Ah...well.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
It is NOT the SimCity board game.  A market drives development of 1-4 boroughs in a city.  You try and balance income generation with gathering population (points in the game).  Euro- no player elimination, easily playable solo and one of the more enjoyable mental exercises that I have had in a while.  Very much worth your while to play.

It's a city building game where there are four types of buildings and various iterations within those types. Buildings have their own effects, trigger off of other buildings, or trigger other buildings. You are constantly struggling to provide income and reputation. There are four public goals (which I completely ignored) and one personal goal (which I choose poorly). This is definitely a game where having an idea what buildings are in the deck and how they interact helps.

Edit:  After playing a lot of this game on iOS, I've downgraded my rating.  This is a game where repeated plays can burn you out on the game.

I enjoy this one more each time I play it.  The interactions between the different tiles can make for some interesting strategical decisions.  Figuring out every consequence of placing a tile can sometimes be fiddly and take a bit to figure out, but most tile placements go pretty fast.  I wish there were more player interaction, there are buildings that become more or less valuable based on what your opponents have, but for the most part it is a solitaire exercise.  But that's not to say that it isn't fun and engaging.  I also enjoy the clean and simple design.

Still need more time with this one; the rating is very tentative. I like it more than she does, mainly because I keep winning. Really not sure, but so far: somewhat luck-driven, might be a problem in particular sessions, but other times quite balanced. More to the point: a bit...boring...not sure why. I think we haven't gotten good enough to avoid money shortages and other dead-end consequences of bad play, so we have our choices limited. But...I want to like it, I think there's something there in all the combo opportunities. Not sure how much play it will get with shelves of great games that we don't mind repeating.

Another game I've been waiting a long while to play thanks to being very limited availability in the UK for some reason. In the meantime, we've actually played Alspach's other newer construction game Castles, and Suburbia definitely feels like a predecessor to the Castles game, but by no means a poor relation. Both games stand up to equal play with Suburbia requiring some very tricky balancing decisions based on what you can see going on in your opponent's town. If you like the Castles mechanics, you'll love Suburbia

Liked the game a lot more than I think I would. Watching other people play at Essen, I thought the game would be fiddly with all the little icons and text on the tiles and that it would be hard to keep track of other players' special abilities. But even though I have some reservations about the random order in which desirable tiles become affordable and the point distribution on the achievement discs, I really liked my first game. It played a bit like a big brother of The City, in that the game is all about finding the right moment to move from income to point generating tiles. It offers a nice effiency puzzle, and as long as players pay attention it should not be too hard to remember the special abilities of other players that you may trigger by selecting an action. I look forward to my next play of this.

Regardless, this has all the trappings of a terrible game.

After several more plays, my initial impressions are mostly still accurate.

A lot of very clean pieces fit together mechanically, and it's very easy to play through a game and make interesting decisions and have an enjoyable time.  But it's also easy for people to be rewarded disproportionately due to tiles coming up when they're in position.  If this was just a case of hitting what you're hoping to draw (and thus rewarding diversity of preparation), that would be fine. 

Unfortunately, a couple of cards (most notably the Casino and PR Firm) unfairly reward ANYONE who happens to be in position to snag them if they come up early enough in their respective stacks.  When either of these cards are grabbed early enough, they benefit ANY strategy, and provide WAY more money income/population income for the dollars spent than any other building, barring odd circumstances.  They are worth buying even from the most expensive position if they come up at the right time, and take no preparation/strategy aside from "have money to buy stuff".  They essentially unlock your scoring potential, which otherwise caps due to the red lines.

There may be other tiles that are also push the luck envelope a bit more than I care for, but those are definitely the egregious offenders, because they're no-brainer lucky.

I'm ok playing the game again, but not suggesting it myself.  And I might go so far as to suggest playing with house-ruled nerfs to the clearly broken tiles.

It is light hearted enough that I don't feel sore when I lose, in fact, I am happy to experiment and discover new ways to play. If there is a lot of competitive tension in the group, this is a must get.

A city building game that uses hex-shaped tiles to assemble your own neighborhood. Players take turns buying tiles before their opponents can purchase it for themselves. Smart tile placement to create synergies will lead to victory, but each game has unique scoring goals, so every play is different. Very engaging, but the plain paper tiles are not tremendously attractive laid out on the table.

Pretty fun building up and figuring out what you'd like to buy - but the hidden goals seem way too important for their sheer level of chaos.  It's very easy for goals to be met or ruined by happenstance and being lucky with how the other players decide to play.  There is also some potential to be ruined by the tile distribution that comes out.  This is bad enough in a 3-player game and would be even worse with 4.

RATING: 8
This and Castles of Mad King Ludwig are similar, mechanically, and this is the one we end up playing most.  The theme is not necessarily as strong, but as someone with a degree in environmental/urban planning, I still love this game.

There are a lot of icons involved, but every tile also has text to help you make sense of things.  This is probably one reason we prefer it to Castles.  It's also pretty competitive and sometimes you'll be torn between doing things to help you get points during the game that may take away your points at the end of the game.  The red lines where you have to drop your population and reputation seemed like they might feel too punishing, but they usually don't.  It forces you to think about balance - if you score too big too fast you'll be scaled back.  This also helps keep one person from running away with the game and making everyone else feel like they should give up.

I do have a pretty big gripe with the hidden agendas however.  You can really be unlucky with the one you get, or just pull an Agenda that isn't even pertinent to the game while your opponent could snag an easy one.   I'd house rule the hidden agendas out personally.

One of those games that feels like it would be better as a computer / phone game. There's just so. much. upkeep. Every time you place something, you need to evaluate that building, adjacent buildings, and ALL buildings that trigger on that type of building being built. Still a good game though.

Nice tile-laying economic game. In short you build up an economic and reputation engine and try to fulfill goals in the meantime to achieve the highest population in the end. Fun halfway, then it just gets too much to keep track of. Also, I would not recommend four players as more players means more towns to keep track of. That is the big downside, because all the players towns synergize with each other you need to be aware all the time not to miss a single positive or negative effect and that is what ruins it for me.

There's no exceptional mechanics here, but the game gets a lot of things just right.  Just complex enough, just thematic enough, and just granular enough, Suburbia gets the modern building of a city in a way that is intuitive and quick-playing.  It is highly reminiscent of [gameid=15364] or [gameid=28620], in that it's nothing new under the sun, but feels tuned perfectly.  The name is misleading -- I mean, who wants to build a bedroom community sycophant that feeds off of the dynamic urban center?  But unlike what the name suggests, this is much more reminiscent of building said urban center.  This is the game that [gameid=3052] should have been.

I think what I love the most about this game is that pretty much everything makes sense about it thematically.  With the number of different tiles in the game and the level of interaction between the tiles, it's a remarkable accomplishment.

This is one of those games where in between plays I always seem to forget about how much I enjoy it, and then make a comment about how much I love it about halfway through the second stack of tiles.

I enjoy the city building aspect, and the decisions required in the buy phase (buy low, buy high, block opponents, etc). It is satisfying to look at your city after it's been built. The variable goals and hidden personal goal should keep the game fresh for many plays. I have only legitimately played this with 1-2, need to play this some more, and with 3 and 4 players, and I suspect it might rise to an 8.

I have played almost one game, we had to end about one round too soon.

First half of the game went on wondering, on the latter half there was some ideas how to play. I focused on couple of things, but of course to master this game, you need to pay attention to more goals and more what your opponents are doing.

Hexagonical city building is nicely done, you buy tiles and lay them on your city, get some new habitats and income and so on. Components look good. At this point it feels like an ok game, but of course needs to be played more. I'm willing to play again in the future.

I tried the apps, and found this game quite enjoyable. Good concept, for once i feel like playing city building simulator. Then i played Castle of Mad King Ludwig, also a great game by the same designer. Then i played the physical version of Suburbia.

Quite painful, i say. Moving the tracks manually is quite a chore. But the deciding factor is the pricing system. After tasting the dynamic pricing in Ludwig, this game feels a bit flat. And the final state of the game doesn't look like city at all. A good game, but not one i would easily enjoy physically.

Random Boredom and Stupidity in Suburbia

Why the hell are a large number of tiles randomly removed from the game?

For variety/replayability? Bollocks! None of the tiles are particularly interesting or unique and nobody gives a crap or even notices a slightly different tile mix from game to game. However, most if not all tiles of a certain type may randomly be removed and make other tiles worthless with no way for players to know this and leading different paths/strategies into a complete deadend. This is just plain stupid.

For unpredictability? Bollocks. There are several ways that tiles are taken/discarded so that you cannot rely on getting specific tiles, so it is completely unnecessary to randomly remove tiles from the game. That other players can screw you over intentionally or accidentally is of course just fine, but that the game setup can screw you over before even starting to play is just moronic game design.

Also, far too fiddly with a "simple" 7-step player aid checklist to go through all the admin everytime you place a tile - including looking for tiny, near invisible symbols on tiles in other players' tableaux when choosing/scoring tiles.

Also, very limited interaction - primarily taking/discarding tiles which other players may want but this is very limited as only a few tiles are affordable and it is not worth spending lots of money just to obstruct another player.

Finally, I did not even lose the game although I lost all interest less than halfway into the game and took crappy action after crappy action which just happened to fulfill my goal plus a common goal rushing past another player who actually played the game.

Suburbia is just such a clever game that is so satisfying to play. The first few turns you see which buildings are available to you, and then you build a strategy around that. The trick of the game is when do you switch over from a high income generating city, to a high reputation (VP) generating city. There seem to be a lot of replayability just in the base game. This is a game I would certainly own myself, if it weren't for the fact that several others in my gaming group already do. Big thumps up and highly recommended.

Suburbia is a game I want to like. Not only is urban planning my profession but I also love games with a spatial element. Yet I find myself after two plays disinterested in Suburbia for the following reasons: (a) The focus on increasing income then victory points is too formulaic and one-dimensional. Sure, the details may vary, but in the end you're doing roughly the same thing every game. Fiddling around with a bunch of different tiles just to increase yourself on two linear tracks gets old fast (b) The goals rub me the wrong way. Having the "most" or "least" of something isn't very interesting nor really congruous with the rest of what's going on in the game, yet the goals are a huge chunk of scoring. To spend 90 mins drafting and spatially arranging tiles on your tableau, developing your economy and later your point engine, and then have the winner come down to who had the least cash on hand at game end just feels stupid. Not to mention each player's secret goal; how that adds value to the game experience other than making player scores non-calculable is beyond me.

To its credit, the game does not overstay its welcome, which excuses some of its one-dimensionality. Yet in the end the spatial elememt isn't interesting enough nor is it a big enough part of the game to make me want to revisit this.

So far, so good, and I say that having only played the two solitaire variants.  I like the way that the tiles work together, and how you're building a self-sustaining borough (otherwise known as your engine) based on what becomes available in the game and what your opponents let you have.  I don't know how the interactivity works, since I've only played it solitaire (though once with the Dalebot), but it sounds like it's a subtle form of interaction, which I like.  All of its parts work together well, and I look forward to playing this multiplayer to see how well it works with other minds playing the game.

My favorite game that I own.  This game challenges your brain in a different way from most games: spatial relation and planning.  Since every tile you lay down is impacted by those around it, you have to think spatially and plan spatially.  It also has lots of economics and engine building and all those other things.  Oh, and it has secret and public objectives (So you won't know who wins until the end of the game) and a mechanic to reign in the person in first, which is always nice. 

And at the end of the game each player gets to tell the story of their town based on which tiles they placed!

As everybody says - the theme is strong in this one. Yet, maybe not the greatest game for 2P.

We will give it another try with the expansion.

RATING: 9
So far I'm loving Suburbia. It really captures the spirit of SimCity while creating its own unique game system. It's loads of fun to try and figure out the best way to combo-out your tiles and to try and thwart your opponents with a well timed hate draft.

There has been some criticisms leveled at the end game bonus goal tiles for being an unbalancing factor. My take is that in a straight up pure point calculating analysis, they are incredibly over-powered. If someone grabs two public goals, they will most likely win...It doesn't matter how well you have planned your city. In-game scoring can not carry you to victory if someone else bonuses out at the end.

Does this break or weaken the game? In my opinion, no. It simply requires players to be a little more alert to what everyone else is doing. It requires everyone to play defense. If everyone is playing alertly, it becomes VERY difficult for someone to score multiple public goals. What we have here is the Puerto Rico effect. If someone at the table is inexperienced or of a significantly lower skill level, someone else will probably win by a landslide.

That's not really a problem in my group. I think as long as a new players are made aware of the importance of the goals going in, they can probably avoid King-making someone else.

Aside from that, I can't recommend this game enough as far as fun factor goes. I can't wait to get my grubby little paws on the expansion...

Fun game. I didn't think it did a lot to distinguish itself, other than the unusually well-integrated theme for a game of this type. One of my pet peeves is the endgame trigger here (shuffle the tile into the pile somewhere), so that didn't endear it. I also thought the randomness was a bit too high for my taste given the length of the game. The goals in particular didn't seem particularly well-balanced. I also had a bit of the same problem I have with Ascension: it was difficult to plan ahead on my turn since I knew I wasn't likely to see most of what was out by my next turn. (Also like Ascension, I've only played this with 4 and suspect I would like it more with 2.) Like a lot of games, it's not so much that I disliked it as that there are quite a few similar games that I'd rather play.

There's a lot to love about Suburbia, but in the end, it's not one I see evolving enough over the the length of the session.

Maybe next time, Ted.

A multi-player Sim City-like board game.  The player who makes the most populous city is the winner.  Fun concept and a good implementation, but with a significant caveat: it is largely multi-player solitaire, but requires players to keep a close eye on other people's turns.  Too easy to overlook scoring during other people's turns, so don't yap too much or leave too long for a beer.  A player in a recent game commented that it is a game better suited for a computer.  Am inclined to agree.  Not keen on the end of game goals either.  They seem arbitrary and tacked on; from reading the game credits, the goals were indeed tacked on.  Negative goals are particularly annoying.  A good game, but not good enough of a game to warrant the focus it requires of me.

After several board-based game and iOS game experience, with all negative comments on how boring/themeless/fiddly calculation it is, I have to conclude that Suburbia is the game to me. Yes there is quite a clear strategy after a few plays, the randomness of tiles ensure different tactics to be applied in each game. Once you master the tiles and your indeed-no-so-busy gameboard, indeed you can properly take care on about what tile they are targeting and to block them accordingly, exempting the game from being multi-play solitaire. iOS version is a great great implementation which became my best time-killing companion. Recommend new comers to have a few trials to fully understand the tile function, combo formulation and you will see the beauty of this intelligent game.

Good city building game. What makes it unique is the fact that one player's city area may affect areas of other players (and vice versa), Suburbia is by no means a multiplayer solitaire. It's a little bit too luck-dependant for my taste though, you can't be sure which tiles will appear in the game and your strategy may backfire. A solid game nonetheless.

This is an interesting tile placement game with a slight economic aspect to it. Players buy districts of different types to add into their suburb, and based on the placement the cities income and population increase. It is important to balance the types of tiles or the income or population growth can become negative. The player with the highest population at the end of the game wins. It is an interesting game, although it is a little long and slow paced for my liking but that does not mean it is a bad game. While it would not be my first choice I would not refuse someone asking to play it.

Normally this would be too abstract for us.  But the draft and tile placing synergistic possibilities is so addictive.

Hidden game ending objectives for each player adds excitement from the uncertainty.

A neat, mathy tile-laying/engine-building game that I enjoyed a lot more than I'd expected to. Each tile you place is affected by your existing tiles and vice versa, but can also be affected by tiles placed by other players. This is a neat element, although the constant recalculating & adjusting can feel fiddly, which is why I prefer this one on iPad. There is also a catch-up mechanism where gaining vps hurts your production, which adds an interesting layer of timing to the decisions.

I had a great time playing this game. It felt a lot like SimCity, which was good. I'm not a big fan of the end game scoring--it almost negates what you do in the main game--or at least that's my initial feeling.

UPDATE: Moving rating from 7 to 9.

Okay, after buying and playing the shit out of Castles, I figured that my initial thoughts and rating of Suburbia were wrong. So I bought the damn game. And I was wrong.

This game is meatier than Castles, and so that is maybe why so many people like it more than Castles. Or maybe it's play order? I don't know. Suburbia is great. I'm still not sold on the end game scoring (if you call it that), but the game is just damn solid and I find myself wanting to play it over and over again--and not to win, but to just build a damn city.

Bit of a slow starter, but once you get past the learning curve (mainly due to the iconography and multiple scoring steps with every turn) it's a very enjoyable and interactive game. Not one I'd introduce to a new gamer, but it scratches the tile-laying and city building itches nicely.

Really like this game. Can get a bit mathy towards the end of the game if you have to resolve all the effects when placing a new tile. But I love games where you build things, and this game provides that in spades! I love the spatial aspect of trying to work with adjacency bonuses or penalties and figuring out what would work well for my particular town.

Good city building game that's a bit heavier than Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  I think I like the "engine building" aspect of this - you really have to plan out your city's layout and think ahead toward how you're going to design your city in the future in order to make sure you have an adequate income and are able to increase your reputation / population growth.  Once you get higher up on the population track, you really get penalized quite quickly for having such high population.  Dealing with that toward the end game is part of the fun!  More of a gamer's game than CoMKL.

Excellent Sim City kind of game with enough variation and possibilities to keep it interesting to play. The only thing is, especially with the "all X tiles" feature, it can be quite tricky to keep overview of all the tile benefits. You easily miss a benefit or reward if you're not focused. With the "All adjacent X tiles" it's easier to keep track.

Played it with 2 and 3 players. Both seems to work very well. With 2 it's a more relaxed city building game. With 3 it's a bit more active and more "crap, i wanted that tile" moves, which makes it more fun. So with 4 it may be even more fun. Or too crowded. We'll see.

A bit more player interaction, or tiles that affect other players more, could have made this game more fun to play. It feels a bit like solitaire at times, but cooler of course.

I've played this a couple times now but they've been pretty spread out. And, at the moment, I'm still not 100% sure what I think about it. It seems like a few reviewers also feel that you need to play the game quite a bit before you can make a determination about the game as well.

There are a lot of things that I enjoy about the game but also a few points that are still up in the air for me. As such, I have put a placeholder ranking down for the game as I enjoyed it but am uncertain where it'll truly end up.

Hidden objective frequently ruins game.  Luck plays too big of a factor compared to similar games.

There are very few things that I could imagine would make this game better. If you want a city building game you can stop looking. I've heard the dice tower guys, other than Tom, complain about how it looks but I don't see the issue at all. I think it looks fine when you are playing it. I do wish I could add the expansions without diluting the percentage of the special tiles like airports and restaurants but other than that this game is amazing.

6.5 after 2 plays

Interaction between tiles implies choice and placement are both very important. Goal tiles increases replayability.

However, decisions seemed somewhat forced and circumstantial. Player interaction is low as one is concentrating on his/her own construction. Substantial bookkeeping during the game as well, and there is a good chance that one will forget to include some income or reputation changes caused by a latest tile.

Suburbia seemed fiddly at first glance. But game was just so smooth that it wasn't noticeable at all. The engine building is great. Although a bit abstract, when the game is done with, just looking at the suburb you created is nice. Plays well at all player counts; even solo!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Suburbia is a fun game, but I find it a bit light. I'm not the target group though, as I have never enjoyed SimCity or similar games. The game needs some sort of small token to mark all your "Every" and "Each of your" tiles so that you can quickly check if your opposing players' builds impact you.

As a solitaire game I find Suburbia a good random puzzle. It's fun how much control you have in your city building, and I can see it appeal greatly to many an old SimCity player, but it's not the solo game for me.

Played it with friends and was shocked about the rules first, but turned out to be not that difficult. Of course you have to develop and re-arrange your strategy throughout the gameplay, but it plays very fluently and is still fun to watch the other players building up their suburbia. Definitely a main game for your gaming night and best played with 4 players.

I really like a lot of the driving mechanics of this game.  The spatial aspects of getting the most out of your tiles and the sliding scale of costs to acquire those tiles felt good and I liked how the various goals gave you something to focus on through the game.  However I did find the book keeping a little tedious. Counting all the different types of tiles that interacted across the cities could make it hard to see which purchase would be most beneficial... but trying to keep track of which of my tiles would change value or interact whenever anybody purchased a certain type of tile seemed too easy to mess up on.  I can see where a group all watching out for those instances could keep things flowing smoothly... but I think I'd prefer this as a computer game to keep track of those permutations.

All the same I'd like to play it again to solidify my opinion one way or the other as the spatial and engine building aspects were really neat.

Last week we were visiting one of the biggest European boardgamestores. While we were looking around in the store I noticed this game in the corner with damaged games. In my Essen 2013 recommendations, I gave this a thumbs down. Simcity converted into a boardgame doesn’t seem interesting to me at all. I loved Simcity and a boardgame of it, should be filled with tons of rules in my eyes. And with over 600 new games to look at in one day, you do a really rough selection. But, somehow, the game kept coming back to me. I’ve read some reviews about it, and slowly (very slowly) I became interested in this one. I the months between October and April, I didn’t became convinced to buy this game, but I sure wanted to give it a try. I even had looked it up, in some on-line stores, but with a price of about EUR50,-, the interest in it turned down very quickly. But there it was. A damaged copy of Suburbia. I took the box and I noticed that it was almost 50% off compared to the on-line stores. And the damage? There were two corners pressed a little (and I mean very little) bit, due to stacking boxes. Decided to by this one, and turn it into a ‘try after you buy’-game.

One day later, I started to unpunching the tiles, and at that point, the frustration began. It had to use a small knife, to cut the edges of the tiles, because the tiles weren’t cut as they should. Over 1 hour later, I finished the job, and I could start looking up the rules on the Internet. We bought a German copy of the game, and I prefer Dutch. I didn’t found any Dutch rules, so I downloaded the English rules (I prefer to read English above German, and M. does vice versa, so two rulebooks in two different languages isn’t to bad for us). Printed out a copy and started to read.

After reading the rules, which aren’t written that well, it seemed like a pretty easy game to us. On a players turn a player:


    Picks a tile to build and pay it’s costs and the extra costs indicated on the spots on the market
    Adjust their income and popularity tracks according to the effects triggered by the new placed tile. This means that all tiles in play (yours and the tiles of other players) have to be checked
    Collect money (indicated by the money track) and let your community grow (indicated by the popularity track)
    Move the tiles on the marked that are left of the just bought tile to the right, and add a new tile from the stack.

Especially step 2 seems a bit overwhelming the first time, but in reality it doesn’t take that long to do all the checks. But this part made us abort our first play, because we realized that we were playing it wrong (it should be hard to earn money, and we had loads of it ), and play it again. After that it turned out to a balanced game. The player with the biggest population wins the game.

There is luck involved in this one, as it is depending on what shows up on the market. But it isn’t a bad kind of luck. You will continuously have to adjust your strategy to let your city grow bigger. The interaction in this game is very minimal, as you’re building your own city, and besides checking the other players tiles if they would effect your newly build tile, there is no interaction. Despite the frustration from the bad die-cutting and the sometimes unclear rules (in both English and German), enjoyed the game very much. I ended my Essen 2013 recommendation for this game with the words: ‘Of course, I might be way wrong.’

I was wrong.

Irondale 2.0 unfortunately has not fixed any of the bugs. I love the concept but the execution sucks.

Great building and bonus tile concepts, but the game is a headache to play.

2012-08-17: It seems mega-fiddly at first, as you cross-reference this hex with that hex, but it actually tends to ease up after that, and is an excellent game.

2015-09-18: The Casino is a tile that should be removed if you play versus Dale the Bot (solitaire), because it is hideously broken without the high cost to offset it. Him paying $3 for it as soon as it hits the line easily gets him over 300 points by game end. That's just not fun.

Solid Alspach game. I don't know if it was me or not, but it felt like the instruction manual didn't really get into the nitty gritty about the detail of the rules.

Even when I lose, I still enjoy thinking about what an impractical, messed up city my creation would be in real life. I once had all three airports that turned up.

Very cool game.  First 2p took about 75 minutes and I could easily see this getting down into the 7 Wonders 45 minute range with repeated plays and experience.  Not particularly deep and does have some bookkeeping issues where there's a good deal of minutiae to track late in the game, but the experience seems worth it to me.

Expect expansions in the future.  Modular design could allow for different editions/themes or just the addition of more contemporary buildings.  Definitely worth your investment.  Almost certain to hit iOS in the future as the iPAD was basically made for this game. 

With increasing plays, I'm liking this less and less with four players just like with seasons.  As you become familiar with all the tiles, there's a bit too much waiting.  Three or two is better.

My new #1 game from the past few years. Maybe it's from all the hours of playing Sim City/2000 growing up that city-building games always seem to strike my fancy. Plus, I love the dynamic of everyone's suburbs affecting one another, and in so doing, meaning that even though a tile might help you, it helps another even more, so you'd just better turn it into a lake. Hugely replayable. Even though there are a lot of things to keep track of from turn to turn, this is a much more gamer's tile-laying game than others like Carcassone or Prosperity. Unlike those games, you can envision the story of your town with a lot of clarity because of the synergy between different tiles. It's a must have.

We purchased this game a few months ago and have enjoyed it immensely. The gameplay was new to us and it's quite fun to build out your town and make strategic decisions about what tiles you pick and where to place them. The gameplay is so compelling that I heard some rumors that it had influenced the latest version of the popular Civilization series of computer games, where purpose-built tile improvements have particular adjacency bonuses like they do in this game. Whether or not there was inspiration, it's clearly a well-liked mechanic. We did find that it's possible in the early game for a player to gain an insurmountable advantage; that hasn't happened too often though so we haven't been too bothered by it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I Have only played the 2 player version of the game and would like to play with more players to see if that changes some of the games dynamics. Not a huge fan of the objectives as the public ones are all-pay-bid-auctions, and the privet ones can be randomly shut down by other players just taking good tiles that you NEED for it. 
Mix in that there just doesn't feel like there is enough restaurants, airports, or other symbol tiles in the game to support tiles like the farms and slaughterhouses and the game just feels unpolished and unbalanced.
I quite enjoy the game for a comfy time, and as long as you don't care about final score and just want to make a cool town its OK, but for anything else it just fails to deliver and is poorly designed.

****UPDATE****
After more play through of the game I have to lower the rating as the flaws I mentioned above were even more impactful than I originally thought. ON top of that there was a very strong strategy that was discovered where you chain Heavy Factories in a straight line at the beginning of the game allowing you to take landfills and other unwanted tiles with only one connection ever, while still being able to support a hub of what ever else you need to make your other engines work, without ever needing to make lakes.
on top of that there are a larger number of tiles that can support a full yellow strategy in the game than just about any other color, and most of those tiles are also yellow.

Great game.  Rules are simple, bits are great.  Gameplay flows. The city building aspect isn't as integrated as it could be, there's no roads you have to match up or tile edges t match.  There are a bunch of triggers you have to watch to get all your points or money but its easy enough to learn.  The base set is a great game on its own but it could be seen as too light for some people and may benefit from a few added layers.  I have not tried the expansion but am eager to.

My wife loves this game.

While I enjoy the theme, it's difficult to get me to buy a light game.  But, the Secret Cabal gaming podcast raved about it so much, that I finally decided to give it a try, and I'm very thankful that I did.  It's light, yes, but I enjoy the decisions and the city building.  Plus, it has solo play, and that's always a big plus in my book.

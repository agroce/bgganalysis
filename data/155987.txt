Rating could be anything from 6 to 10. I'm setting it to 9 after one play because I won. ;) If I lose next time, it'll go down to an 8. ;)

Honestly, though, this is again a very well rounded game by Mr. Catala, which combines simple game mechanics ("Go fish" in this case, a simple bidding mechanic in Cyclades) with elegant design, which is a breeze to play. I like it!

It's a light to medium-heavy set collection game. Players take turns until one player recruit 7th Lord or only 2 Lord cards left on the board. 3 phases: Plot at Court - pay 1 Pearl each to fill the court (optional) then Take 1 Action (Explore the Depths - Ally/Monster OR Request Support from the Council OR Recruit a Lord) which ties in with the 3 tracks on board then Control Location (mandatory) if you have 3 Keys or more. You get points from Locations (bonus multiplier), Lords, Affiliated Allies & Monster Tiles. Most importantly, get Allies to recruit the Lords to control Locations. The Lord cards required some reading which might be a turn off to some. The Pearls as resources is what drawn me to this game but it's not really useful during the game, only for some actions. The visual & the colourfulness of the game is mesmerizing nevertheless. Too light for my taste, a bit thin on theme, not so much a keeper.

Maybe a little long for a card game, but the theme is good and the art is amazing!  The rhythm takes a little getting used to.  It feels like a different experience, but it really isn't anything new, mechanically.  I really enjoyed balancing the "temporary" powers; I liked all of the control over this.

This has been my second favorite game I've ever played for several years.  I got the expansion, but it honestly doesn't need one.  The base game is still fun and different every time I've played.  Never gonna get old...

RATING: 5.5
I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Amazing artwork and high component quality aside, I was pretty underwhelmed by Abyss... maybe due to the hype that the game got before it came out or maybe even because that amazing artwork builds up your expectations a lot.

Concerning game-play, Abyss is a straight-forward family level game all about set collection. Its twist on this fairly common concept is that you can easily give yourself more options, but at the same time you're giving more options also to your opponents. And, while I like the idea a lot, I ended up being disappointed by its execution. I thought it would have created interesting decision making situations, instead while playing I felt that there was really no doubt about what to do. At the end of the day if you take a mediocre card/lord/territory tile for yourself so that your opponent has to take a mediocre one too... you could just as well take the chance to get the one you want and grant the same chance to your opponents. So it all comes down to luck at the end.

The second issue I've with Abyss concerns the red lords. They are just a bunch of take-that cards! Even if I usually like games with conflict, it really bothers me instead in games like Elysium or this one. It feels to me like an element that doesn't belong... like something they added just to give something to Ameritrash players, while the rest of the game is on a completely different planet. The main focus of Abyss is resource/hand management and efficiency... and while these mechanisms sometimes are well integrated with conflict elements, that is not the case here for me. Actually Abyss it's even worse than Elysium in this respect, because at least in Elysium you can remove the take-that cards from your games. That is something you cannot do in Abyss instead.

All that being said, the game is not completely bad. Maybe its visual appeal played a role in this, but I had a decent time playing Abyss. Not decent enough to give it a positive rating, but not bad enough to give it a really bad one either. Still I don't really care if I never play Abyss again... So, I guess, this means that it's a pretty mediocre game. Such a pity for the beautiful artwork.

It landed surprisingly well in my collection. I didn't expected it to get such good reactions from my friends and myself. The rules before trying it out seemed very foggy and strange, but once played, the game shines with its pure originality. And it's not just original to be original and therefore very clumsy, it's original, fresh and polished, it has some mechanics, that feel new, work great and makes this game unique. In advance it has amazing art design, it's beautiful, and though it's lore is not described too well, the theme is strong and it feels great. As for the components - they are all really good, especially I like pearls as currency, awesome idea.

"I am Jacques Cousteau. Join me on an expedition into the depths of the Abyss, a world of unimaginable monsters, a world where neither sunlight nor theme can ever penetrate."

It's the art that prevents this game from being completely lame. I will happily play this anytime just so I can experience flights of fancy as I ponder the exceptionally beautiful art, especially that of the location cards; but the art is what makes the game so disappointing, as it holds the promise of a wonderful, fantastical undersea epic struggle, and doesn't even try to deliver. You're then left with nothing but mechanics, which are quite run of the mill.

I'll play Abyss anytime just to see the art (for which I give it an 8). The mechanics are pretty standard (for which I give it a 6). Thus, my rating of 7.

Abyss is a game of collecting five types of ally (although you can think of them as resources or currencies) to convert into Lords.  Lords score victory points, have special powers and may help you towards getting locations that will score even more points.  So far, so run of the mill.  Abyss does offer some novelty in the ways that ally cards are obtained.  Exploring involves turning up as many cards as you wish up to a limit.  After each one is turned, the other players have an opportunity to purchase it.  Purchasing becomes progressively more expensive. Ally cards that aren't taken go to the Council, where sets of the same colour can be hoovered up as an alternative to exploring.  While mechanically this is a bit different, the decisions involved are not hugely taxing.  That last comment could really apply to the entire game; it works, it does things a little differently, it is reasonably enjoyable to play, and  yet there isn't quite enough meat for this hardcore gamer to chew on.

The artwork is terrific and component quality is good.  Despite my fumbling fingers, I didn't find the much criticised pearls a problem.  The rules are well written and appear complete.

Σχετικά απλό καρτοπαίχνιδο όπου ουσιαστικά μαζεύουμε κάρτες διαφόρων χρωμάτων και με αυτές αγοράζουμε κάποιες άλλες κάρτες Λόρδους που δίνουν VP και κάποιο ability. Φέρνει δηλαδή κάπως σε Alhambra με τα λεφτά σε διάφορα χρώματα όπου αγοράζεις κτήρια στα αντίστοιχα χρώματα.

Ενδιαφέρον παρουσιάζει ο βασικός μηχανισμός για να μαζέψεις κάρτες, αφού ανοίγεις τις κάρτες από την τράπουλα μια μια και κάθε φορά οι αντίπαλοι έχουν τον πρώτο λόγο για το αν θέλουν να αγοράσουν την κάρτα που μόλις άνοιξες. Σε πληρώνουν με μαργαριτάρια, τα οποία έχουν διάφορες χρήσεις στο παιχνίδι. Αν δεν αγοράσουν την κάρτα τότε μπορείς να την πάρεις εσύ δωρεάν ή να ανοίξεις την επόμενη.

Επίσης ενδιαφέρον παρουσιάζει το γεγονός πως οι λόρδοι πολλές φορές έχουν και ένα κλειδί πάνω στην κάρτα τους. Μόλις μαζέψεις 3 κλειδιά κερδίζεις μια τοποθεσία η οποία θα σου δώσει VP στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού (ανάλογα πάντα με το τι έχεις μαζέψει) αλλά πλέον χάνεις τις ικανότητες των τριών αυτών λόρδων. Οπότε από την μια θέλεις να δουλέψει λίγο ακόμα το ability αλλά από την άλλη θέλεις και τα VP. Nice.

Το παιχνίδι έχει υπέροχο artwork (από τις ελάχιστες περιπτώσεις που καθόμουν και παρατηρούσα τις κάρτες για ώρα) αλλά γενικά το θέμα του υπάρχει απλά για να λέμε πως υπάρχει. Μας πήρε λίγο κάτω από μια ώρα για μια πρώτη παρτίδα τριών παικτών. Δεν ξετρελάθηκα αλλά δεν το λες και κακό παιχνίδι. Πάντως στην αρχή βλέποντας το κουτί με το κάπως dark artwork νόμιζα πως θα παίξουμε καμιά ameritrashιά με ξυλίκι arrrh αλλά τελικά το Abyss είναι light προς medium euro με έμφαση στις τακτικές επιλογές.

Να σημειώσω επίσης πως κάποιες από της τοποθεσίες και τους Λόρδος μου φάνηκαν πολύ πιο δυνατοί από τους υπόλοιπους κάτι το οποίο γενικά δε μου αρέσει. Για παράδειγμα η τοποθεσία που σου επιτρέπει να ψάξεις την στοίβα με τις τοποθεσίες και να πάρεις όποια θες είναι απίστευτα δυνατή. Ενώ όλοι διαλέγουν μια τοποθεσία από 3-4, με αυτήν παίρνεις ότι θες.

Αξιόλογο παιχνίδι κατάλληλο για οικογένειες και casual παρέες. Έχει το εντυπωσιακό artwork για να τραβήξει το ενδιαφέρον τους, έχει μια δόση τύχης για να είναι αμφίρροπος ο νικητής, έχει αρκετό interaction και παράλληλα έχει και ένα στοιχειώδες εύρος επιλογών για να μην βαρεθεί κάποιος που προτιμάει πιο βαριά παιχνίδια στρατηγικής.

One of the big disappointments of this year, the game is nothing like the game box promises. If themed and advertised as gateway game, than it would deserve an 8 - it is in fact a good game for beginners. But experienced players expect more - properly balanced cards and locations and a more challenging game play, more meaningful decisions. The are, however, is gorgeous, probably best I've seen in a euro - thus a rating above four.

Excellent components and artwork, obviously, but the mechanics aren't as mediocre as some reviewers would have you believe. This is a lightish game that runs a little long, perhaps, but my group have enjoyed it. Scores have been very close in the games we have played and for most turns I felt like I had a few different options available to me. The mechanic of buying cards that others are exploring corrodes downtime and there were a number of strategies at work in our four player game. I’ll see whether this one stands the test of time. If people insist on comparing this to 7 Wonders (which in my opinion makes absolutely no sense at all), then 7 Wonders is much better.

For a family game, the game has fantastic artwork and sound mechanics. There is just enough going on to make it interesting and to keep the choices tense. That being sound, I found the game a bit clunky. Like Ticket to Ride, players are often drawing cards... drawing cards... drawing cards... in hopes of making a meaningful decision in the future. The tedious nature of the auction makes the game a tad too slow for what it offers.

Not a bad game. Just not a great one either.

Abyss has quality components, fantastic vivid art and design. The theme is underwater civilization and battle for political power. The theme is well executed and the iconography is colour coded and intuitive with clans/types sorted into colour & species. Plus the money is tiny pear beads or pearls (because of the theme which was cute).

Initially it was the art that attracted me to the game as both dark and vibrant colours. The game is a basic victory point collection game that utilizes interesting risk reward management for both earning $, providing yourself with options and providing your opponents with options.

Simple and easy to learn, the variety of strategies for points gives the game re-play-ability with the right blend of competition without player elimination or direct combat. 

Everyone I've played this with enjoys it from seasoned gamers both competitive and non competitive and also casual players.

The game is broken up into a few different actions: Exploring the depth, Requesting councils Assistance or Recruiting lords. 

Players recruit followers from the different clans which are used to recruit lords and score points. Lords have a cost of followers (# and colour which players must exceed to recruit them) each lord has an ability & point value that help players win the game. Certain lords (or actions) will grant players keys, every 3rd key unlocks a location which often multiplies players victory points but will cover/lock the lords active abilities. 

Giving players yet another option for balancing points and variability in strategy. 

The coolest thing for me in this game was exploring the depth, wherein players flip over potential recruitment cards. As you flip cards the current player must offer the available card to the player on their left & each other player in turn before having the option to keep the card for herself. This means that on your turn the more cards you flip the better chance you have to get a card you are looking for but you are also providing your opponents with this same chance. IF another player wishes to recruit a card you have discovered they pay the active player, so exploring while helping your opponents may also earn the player pearls (currency) they need to perform additional actions.

Tényleg szép, ahogy sok helyről hallottam már előtte, és nagyon egyszerű, letisztult a szabály, és a játékmenet is, végül is csak 3 féle akció van. Tetszett, de valahogy nem érzem átütőnek, valahogy kevés a dilemmás helyzet a játékban. Pl. az hogy 2. 3. játékosként melyik kártyát vegyem meg, túl egyértelmű. A lordok választásán lehet agyalni, és itt többféle stratégia is kínálkozik (pl. gyorsan rámenni 7-re, vagy inkább kevés lord amin sok kulcs van...). Szóval nem rossz, de nem tudom hány játék van benne. De mégis azt mondom, hogy szívesen játszom vele bármikor, annak ellenére, hogy a téma nem annyira az esetem. Durva, hogy idén mennyi játékkal jelentkezett a szerző...

I will state the obvious saying that Abyss' main selling point is the over-the-top artwork, perhaps unparalleled in the boardgame industry.
This artwork is probably a huge misleading factor in setting wrong expectations about gameplay: it looks as some high conflict american game (à la Cosmic Encounter, or other FFG game), but it plays like a euro with low and indirect interaction.
Even the (only) fighting part mentioned in the rules (monsters) is just a way to gather some resource or VP, boiling down to a decision about doing it now, or let the "monster" get away and come back later bringing a greater reward for the next player encountering it.

The truth: Abyss is a filler in the same niche Splendor occupies. And it is kinda good! But its ratings will suffer for those misleaded expectations.

There is a clever mechanic for drafting ally cards, used by players to acquire lords. Lords bring players victory points, powers and keys. As soon as a player gets three keys, he loses the power but gains a territory (with end game scoring bonuses).

At the end of a 30-45 minutes quite light ride, players score points for lords, set aside allies and a hidden (2-4 pts) tokens.

Is it good, beyond the art? I have to play it some more, but I am inclined to say yes...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The stunning artwork was my first draw to this game, followed by generally positive reviews.  I'm glad I made the plunge, because Abyss is a very enjoyable game with high quality components.

The game play is unique and rewarding, yet reasonably simple.  I was able to get my wife to play it, and even though it pushes the limits of what she considers too complicated, she actually enjoyed it.  That's a plus in my book!

Really an 8.5 rating. 

Some of the most beautiful art you'll find in a boardgame. Just gorgeous. 

The game plays smoothly. In most cases people have trouble with the game because the don't read with comprehension and overlook the smaller rules. I do deduct .5 of a point for one or two Lord cards that can throw you off.

The game runs fine but nothing too exciting ... The only originality is in the acquisition of resources, unfortunately it appears long and repetitive. The rest of the game is classic : buy lords with the appropriate resources.

The illustrations are nice but too dark (especially the board), so it's difficult to play in a dimly lit place.

An average game no more.

(3-5 Players, 60 min) A crafty game of undersea politics. Search the depths for support from various marine creatures with which to grab the attention of the nobles of the undersea kingdom. Shrewd manipulation of support and trading pearls to other players will pay off in your goal to be the power behind the aquatic throne.

My first play of Abyss was less than stellar. I didn't grasp a purpose early, and played about as poorly as one can play. I finally threw up my hands and just started adding cards. Came in second, beating 2 seasoned players. Makes me wonder what I could have done had I understood what I was doing!

Amazing set collection game. The theme isn't immersive, but it's cool, and it makes for some drool-inducing artwork. The interaction is high and really interesting. Having to offer cards you might want to your opponents first is a neat mechanic, as is the fact that the price for grabbing cards from you rises. The lord powers are varied and interesting, as are the location rewards. There are many choices for you and your opponents to make in this game, making it a balanced, competitive, joy of a game. The only thing holding it from 10/10 is scaling and playtime. 2 players plays very slowly and ends too soon, and AP can push this game towards overstaying its welcome.

Beautiful underwater fantasy artwork and graphic design.  Players explore the depths to acquire ally/affiliate cards in five races to acquire lords or fight monsters.  As keys are acquired you 'unlock' locations with end game bonuses.  All the while you are collecting and spending pearls to fund some of your decisions.  The game is easy to teach and plays quickly for 2-4 players.  Player with the most influence points wins.

The cover art kept me away from ever looking into this one before I played it. Actually, the art in the game is nice and I'd clearly "judged this book by its cover."  Abyss is a simple card-collection game of racing to recruit influential lords who can provide powers and points and eventually more points when you've collected enough keys with your lords. The euro-style parts of the game seem pretty well designed and kind of interesting, but the direct conflict with some of the lords' powers didn't fit for me. I won't play this again.

The obvious thing is that the artwork is gorgeous! But we all really enjoyed the gameplay as well. There were different strategies employed, and a close game with all players. A very good time!

RATING: 6
After being awe-struck by the stunning art, I wanted to play Abyss so badly, even though I knew it’s a plain eurogame: now I have tried it out a few times and, even though it isn’t as shallow or dry as one could expect from such games (I guess its theme kind of prevents Abyss from being shallow or dry...), it still doesn’t impress me at all.

It’s one of those games you have to play a few times to master, after which they lose all their attractiveness, bound to be forgotten in a few years.

The art though, that’s memorable...

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Interesting card drafting game with amazing art.  This game might have the best art of any game I have ever played!  There are basically 3 things you can do on your turn, all of which will give you cards in some way.  You will try to use these cards to find combos to give you the most points (or slow down your opponents).  One big theme in this one seems to be that it allows for you to reach "further", but by doing so, you are helping your opponents.  Its pretty neat, as sometimes it can be tough to tame yourself, because you can see a big pay day at the end of the tunnel... but there could be a bigger one for an opponent if you go that route.  One I am interested in exploring more with different player counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game where you are building some sort of empire - beautiful artwork on a theme that is just tacked on. But there are a lot of different mechanics you can choose (draw cards with a buying mechanic, buy cards with an ability, collect keys, push your luck on the card draw, take piles of cards, it sounds like a mess, but it works pretty nicely. A good group of people made this game quite enjoyable.

Pretty to look at, pretty dull to play, pretty annoying they didn't code the kingdoms with which lords they apply to (who are the politicians, etc - colour coding is great if you can actually see the colours). For a game about the ocean depths pretty dry.

A decent, light card game that would have been perfect if it had been marketed as such. Instead, ridiculously overproduced as it is, it was kind of a disappointment. This should have been a $15-20 small-box card game (a la Onirim), but with the unnecessary board, pearls, and pearl-holders, it's not only overpriced but awkwardly much larger than it should be. 

It's too bad, because this would be a perfect game to play at a café or take on vacation. Now, it spends most of its time sitting on my shelf.

One play, so take it for what it's worth. I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I enjoyed it *enough*, given the competition. There was a lot of talk about the setting and worldbuilding on Abyss, and I have to say I don't think it came through much in the design; this is a pretty straight-ahead eurogame, albeit a fairly well-executed one. Unfortunately the physical design is not great and impedes playability; lots of murky, indistinct colors that makes playing hard until you've internalized everything. A little bit more effort to make the color-coding pop a bit more (mainly on the locations) would have been really helpful. Also, white text on the dark background kinda sucks; what are you going to do, I guess, given the other choices, but it could have been larger. That was all a bit rant-y, but I do think usability was sacrificed too much in the physical design and the payoff in terms of art wasn't really good enough.

Anyway, a classic borderline game for me. I'd like to play it again. I suspect it's not a keeper, but it could surprise me.

Even though the game is far different, Abyss actually felt a lot like playing Ticket to Ride.  You spend a lot of turns drafting cards, and some turns you spend those cards on something that scores you points, hoping other players don't beat you to the thing you had your eye on.

A pretty good family-level complexity game, maybe on the more complicated end for families due to the special abilities on the cards.

The game is very visually stunning, and many of the components are really overdone, but in a good way that makes the game just plain look cool.  There are location tiles in the game that have giant awesome illustrations that could have easily just been done as cards.  The currency is actual (fake) pearls instead of punchboard pearls, and shell-shaped cups are provided to keep your pearls in.  Extremely well done on the production side of things, as the French have a real knack for!

Overall, a pretty decent game, but I think the stunning production quality is more appealing than the actual game play.

Very good mid-weight family style game. Easy to learn, lot of enjoyment during play. Full of good mechanisms: you can pay active player to acquire high-value Allie card, abilities of Lords help during a game, but when you get a Location tile, you have to cover some Lords, so you no longer may use their abilities, when you pay Allie cards you join the weakest Allie and you score for strongest, and at the end you have a chcnce to join  Allies from your hand. Good amount of strategy for a fairly simple game. Looking forward to Kraken expansion as well. Good theme, one of the best artwork i have ever seen in game and great components (those pearls as a currency are just awesome) and it looks so well on the table.

RATING: 9
The art is great, but fantasy themes don't do anything for me so it is hard for me to get sucked into it. The options each turn are very simple, which is great, but you have great choices to make about which action to do each turn. Since you can only do 1 thing each turn by the time it is your turn again your choice may not be the best so you do have to think about your 3 actions carefully to get the most out of each turn. 

I thought it played fine with 2, which I wasn't sure it would so that was good to see. I still think it will be better with more, but I wouldn't turn it down again either.

After another play I'm raising my rating to an 9. Even though we had a tough lord setup to get stated with, it was another great game with plenty of tension. I need to be better at remembering what lords I have since I didn't take advantage of them. Can't wait to play this again and the expansion.

Surprisingly light. Didn't expect that. It's basically a use X currency to buy Y currency to buy VP. Has a bit of interesting mechanical things on top of that but it's pretty slimmed down in a good way. I also love that it feels that a lot of decisions you make are at the risk of helping others more than yourself. A great design.

I really like the way the mechanics are brought together to really make it feel as though the player is building forces. Simple, but effective - especially the exploration draw cycle.

If only the box were a standard size, rather than a snip smaller. I *hate* it when games are irregular in this manner.

What an overhyped, overproduced game.. The gameplay is an interesting twist on the auction, set collection,  special ability VP escalation motif, but the end result felt flat and lifeless, and the mechanisms themselves disjointed and loose. In addition, the game suffers from excessive luck of the draw, that seems to get more decisive the more players learn the game. The art is phenomenal, but the game board and cards could use clearer iconography. The pearls and pearls cups hindered more than helped the game.

This is a mediocre game at best. Will not seek to play it again.

Many are disappointed by the game because they think the game mechanics don't stand to the artworks.
Yes, the artworks are gorgeous but for me it adds a lot of flavor to the game.
The mechanics are really simple but I think you can do a lot of plays not doing the same thing. The main task to win this game is doing the right thing at the right moment (I think Bruno Cathala like to have peoples who plays his game have a hard time choosing between 2 or more actions.)
So, Nice game for me. Not a big hit but It deserves surely its 8/10.

A little too easy for my play group. There was a lot of picking and passing with not much strategy. It also seemed weird that if you decided to defeat a monster that it was just automatically defeated. There was also a player that continually drew the sea monster card making it especially not fun for him. I didn't think the amount of cards were balanced afterwards.

If my bride didn't love it so much, it'd be gone.  Set collection and obfuscated victory points are not my bag.  I do, however, really dig the way cards are "gifted" out in a kind of push-your-luck manner.  I just wish the design built in more direct player interaction.

RATING: 7.5
Graphically superb 2-step card game. The players collect a first type of cards (5 types/colours of allies, with values from 1 to 5), which are combined in order to acquire a second type of cards (Lords of the Abyss, each with their own characteristics), by means of which points are scored. By means of affiliation of allies extra points are scored. The game plays fluently, is quite simple, but nevertheless the different ways in which to score points keep the game interesting. One downside: player order is important and is fixed throughout the game. The game ends when a player recruits his 7th Lord, after which all other players still get a game turn. This implies that only in the case when the starting player finishes the game every player gets an equal amount of game turns. If the second player finishes the game, the starting player gets 1 game turn more than all other players. If the last player finishes the game, all his/her adversaries get to play an extra game turn. Is this important? Oh yes...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
The artwork is something great in this game.

There are some elements i dislike a bit, like the different features of the cards ("Lords") you have to pick to establish your set collection (forces you to "study" the game a little and some of the cards powers seem too strong) and the fact you have to renounce their powers once they are framed into a location (a kind of anti-climax thing. Besides, the locations also have different features...).
However, the game runs fairly easy and in a short time (less than 60 minutes), with some cool things involving negotiation and bidding, as also the final score. Overall, a nice experience.

Good quality components and stellar art. Unique theme but ultimately a euro card game in a race for points with some indirect group interaction through card effects.

Random card draw can affect performance but there are a lot of options to go through in terms of points and manipulating leaders, locations, and keys. Decent next step card game.

Green Box. Amazing art and solid rules but this one feels a little too "soulless euro" to warrant additional plays. Abyss is basically a bunch of euro hand management/tableau building mechanics that very loosely correlate with the theme. The theme is absolutely "pasted on" which is a shame, since the art and teased lore is so interesting. I'm sure the game plays better with 2+ players but we never got a chance to get it to the table with more before trading it away.

The artwork of this game is probably it's biggest plus. It's a fun game but there wasn't anything specific to this game that made me think, "Wow, I love this game." I'd play it again if that's what is being played, but would rather play other games over this.

Com més hi jugo, més m'agrada perquè vaig veient l'ampli ventall de possibilitats que s'obren.
És un joc lleuger i ràpid, alguns el poden anomenar "filler", però té prou decisions a prendre i prous maneres diferents d'afrontar la partida com per donar profunditat al joc.
Cada partida pot resultar diferent segons els Lords i Localitzacions que surtin d'inici.

The first thing to say about this game is the great artwork it has.
The theme is nice and the components add in-depth to that.
The game plays smoothly and is a really fast paced game.
It's easy to learn and play but the replayability is huge, there are a lot of location + Lord combos to do.
A nice looking card driven game that plays in 40mins.

RATING: 6
Underneath the amazing art is a relatively simple card game.  The core mechanism is the card row that is revealed one at a time in push your luck fashion, the opportunities for other players to buy those cards before you do, and the way they drop into sorted discard piles which other players can claim.  All the faction tiles you buy for scoring are simply the output of how well you manage the game of the currency cards.

I think the best position to be in is left of the current player so put special thought into the turn of the player on your right.  Overall this game was fun to play but a little too light for my tastes.  I also thought the flop of the cards was a touch too random: later in the game, each player has more specific needs as their strategies gel and the player whose random draws best match their needs will have a big leg up.  The game is not short enough for that sort of randomness to be desirable.

This game has been accused of being a lite set collection game in a big box. I disagree! This game immerses you in the world of under water politics like nothing else! Yes, the game-play can sometimes feel disconnected from the theme, but, as you gain allies and recruit lords and take over locations a beautiful story unfolds right before your eyes. This story is as equally compelling as the game mechanics that are driving it!

Thematically, it makes no sense, but the stellar artwork helps mask that.   The gameplay is pretty simple - collect sets to buy character cards which give some temporary abilities or bonuses.   There's not a whole lot to it, but it flows well enough and lasts just the right amount of time.  The expansion adds a bit more meat, but I wouldn't say it is essential.

Abyss is a game I've had the opportunity to play a few times now.  While I believe its price tag isn't merited, it still remains a good game of strategy that is worth visiting from time to time.  It's not something I would like to put on the table on a regular basis, but it does have a pretty decent crunch to it that makes what time you spend with it a worthwhile experience.

The biggest hit against it is its forced theme.  By the books, the mechanics of the game are very Euro and very straightforward, but the designers applied unnecessary vocabulary that befuddles the more casual mind.  Even regular gamers should be properly confused at some of the design choices in this respect.  To illustrate this, ally cards (a secondary currency, if you will) and Lord cards (scoring and abilities) belong to one of five categories represented by icons (for factions, you see).  One of these, for example, is an octopus or squid tentacle.  When referring to the ally cards for this icon, they are squids, but the Lord cards are politicians.  Crab cards are military or soldier, etc.  It's a weird design choice that always ends up with someone asking what faction is what.  This could have been easily avoided by simply including the icons on descriptions where needed (for example, if a location gives you a bonus for Merchants, it'd be so easy to simply print the clamshell icon right next to it and there'd be no confusion).  YMMV if this is a major or minor quibble, but it is a quibble nevertheless.

Otherwise you have a perfectly sensible game where players seek to build the best scoring combos by the end of the game.  There are no bonuses for triggering the endgame, though, so it's not always a good idea to rush it through.

With the expansion that includes the Kraken cards, much-needed tension is added to the game, to the point where I would say I'd never want to play Abyss without 'em.  They introduce black pearls (called Nebuli) which are useful as spare change, but ultimately have negative impact on your scoring.  Dealing with these as you get them provides an extra layer that can make or break a player and when compared to the vanilla game, it's a world apart.

Fun and light romp! The game was easy to teach/learn and quick to play. Downtime was minimal as the other players also had a part to play on your time. Only played with 2 players so some of the push-your-luck elements are a little wasted on us. 

Overall, we felt that the decisions were meaningful enough that it made the game a good time.  The art is gorgeous~

2017-02-21 : Back when this game came out there was a serious hype about it- both for the graphics and the gameplay and it went out of print really fast. Never got the chance to play it until yesterday. The first thing I notice is that for such a hyped game the graphics aren't all that great. And the layout of the board for the council is simply bad, making it too hard to see what color cards go where. And that's on top of the other layout mistakes made with the Lord cards where lots of text could have been replaced by icons. Ok, so totally overhyped on the graphics department, but how's the gameplay ? Well, mundane is the best description. Most of the time it's pretty obvious what your best choice is and sometimes there's really no choice at all. There's a bit of long-term strategy, but it's not really deep and luck plays a major part. Again a game where there's not much wrong with it, it's just uninspiring and keeps me scratching my head as to where all the hype for this game came from ?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played a second game with 4 players... verdict is still out. Was distracted much of the game by kids and others, but my general impression is that this is just an OK card game in a really pretty, really large box. There's some good decisions and trade offs that you have to make and I could see enjoying this on the same level as a game like San Juan, but... this is in a much bigger, unecessary package. Would like one more play but this is seemingly headed for my trade pile.

RATING: 7
Is Abyss a lighter game than you would anticipate based on the artwork, price, and size of the box? Yes.
Is the game expensive compared to other games that are of this length/depth? Yes.
Do I find it disappointing that there are only 35 Lord cards in the game (which are the cards that provide special abilities) and they are not evenly distributed amongst the factions? Yes.
Are you disappointed by the fact that the theme is irrelevant based on how hyped the theme was prior to the games release? No, but others were.

You would think that would lead to a negative comment/rating.  Especially considering that this is a lighter card game than what I typically go for. That said, this is a really easy to teach, family-style card game that plays in under an hour. While it's lighter than I normally like, there is still some interesting decisions to be made. If that weren't enough, at the time of writing this, Abyss has some of the best artwork of any game I have ever seen. Beyond having excellent artwork, the components for the game are also fantastic. The one negative would have to be regarding the monster track that very rarely goes above 2 spots. If you're looking for a quick and light card game (ie Splendor) that will draw people in based on components and artwork, this is your game.

A perfectly lovely light game with just enough going on to maintain interest yet not ask too much brain-wise. Nothing novel, just a solid game. 

Usually digesting too many unique card abilities/powers can annoy me but it's entirely manageable here since the powers are very straightforward. The artwork is very nice and I found myself immersed in the theme (no pun intended).

The game really overstays its welcome. It feels like the weight of 7 Wonders but it lasts too long for what it is. The combined push your luck and market phase is really interesting, but unfortunately the game wrapped around it is just "meh".

One big problem with it is the total lack of iconography. Lengthy card text could often have been advantageously replaced by simple icons. The end result is that you end up passing cards and tiles around to read them, then refer to the rules to remember what a "diplomat" or an "allie" is.

Többet vártam tőle. Valahogy ez a felcsapós dolog elég random, és bosszantó. Sokat számít, hogy csupa különbözőt, vagy egyformákat csapsz fel, hiszen gyakorlatilag a mögötted ülőnek kedvezel. Hármasban ez valahogy be is tudott akadni: mindig ugyanannál az embernél fogytak el a pakkok, és mindig ő csaphatott fel újra. Adok neki még egy esélyt, mert lehet, hogy csak a különleges mechanizmust kell szokni.
Így elsőre 6.8
-------
Reméltem, hogy a második játékra összeáll és sokkal élvezetesebb lesz, de nem így történt, sőt. Valahogy nincs meg benne semmi, aminek kéne:
- nincs tematika
- nincsenek komoly döntések
- aránylag nagy a szerencse
- és ami a legfontosabb, egy percig se köt le, valahogy annyira jelentéktelen.

Érdekes, mert az alapmechanizmus nem lenne rossz, de valahogy nem sikerült belőle játékot csinálni. Kár a sok szép grafikáért... :(

-> 6.1

Ein gängiger Versteigerungsmechanismus, Sammelkarten für Zielkarten und weitere bekannte Elemente vermitteln spieltechnisch ein gewohntes Spielgefühl. Und dennoch: Da ist ein Zauberschimmer. Das liegt vor allem an dem überragenden, geheimnisvollen Artwork, von dem deeper, mystischer Strom ausgeht, der das Spiel umhüllt. ABYSS ist ein vorbildliches Beispiel wie atmosphärisches Look&Feel ein Spiel tatsächlich anheben und das Gewöhnliche zum Funkeln bringen kann. Der visuelle Ausflug ins dunkle Meer macht den feinen Unterschied. Die Muschelperlen als Zahlungsmittel setzen Neptun die Krone auf. ABYSS ist lebendiges Bewusstsein und  Anschauungsunterricht für die Qualität von Material und Auge.

I liked it! Actually, it exceeded my expectations. I remember when Abyss came out a few years ago and the same critical point was made by a number of players: the awesome art and production doesn't cover up that this is a straightforward, slightly dry card game. So I didn't exactly avoid Abyss, but I didn't go out of my way to play it. As I recall, Abyss was one of the early points of modern gaming where people were accusing game companies of overproduction in order to cover up for less-than-stellar gameplay. And that still happens! And it's true that people will invest in a game if it looks great, before the reviews are even in on if the gameplay is any good.  Abyss, however, is not just a passable card game; I think it's actually rather strong. Lots of interesting decisions about in terms of when to buy cards or take a pile of cards or trade them in for Lords that grant certain powers - until a point when you have to trade those in for point-scoring locations. It actually flows amazingly well (though the decision-making with the push-your-luck drafting track feels rarely like a tough decision, unfortunately). I have to admit that I think it's quite a bit stronger with the Kraken expansion which adds a little conflict and meanness to the game - just a little - and that's exactly what it needs, really.  So I consider this and the expansion the complete game. Unfortunately, due to the high production value of Abyss, this means that you're spending just over $100 to get a good card game. It's hard to justify that cost when you know you're paying more for production than mechanics. Again - Abyss is a good game, almost I'd say, a _very_ good game, but there's not enough in it to justify what I would pay normally for FFG big box game, or something of the like. As beautiful as it is, I hope at some point Asmodee will lower the price (ha!) to make this game a little more accessible. Instead, Asmodee keeps this one on the list of games where "you should only be buying one or two great games a year" (just quoting a hapless Asmodee employee).

Piękne grafiki - warto mieć chociażby po to, żeby się nimi nacieszyć. Licytacje, trochę strategii i planowania plus push your luck. Na przyjemną posiadówkę zawsze warto wyciągnąć, żeby trochę pogłówkować, bo jak się okazuje, idzie całkiem sporo punktów wykręcić (nawet 100).

Great art and even though there are simple and easy to understand mechanisms here (Set Collection) there is strategy and thought you can put into it if you want.  It is very light and quick but satisfying for a game that presents itself as a bigger game than it is.  

Two qualms.  (1)Everything linen finished but the cards so they slide everywhere. Please publishers, charge us $2 more and make a card heavy game better with linen!  (2)Monster tokens should have variable points/text like lords and locations with the same range (2-4).

It's a fine game of push-your-luck and economy. It's a fascinating combo and it has plenty of curious interactions, but it's rather light. The most interesting part of the game is the explore action, but it helps your opponents almost too much, so it doesn't happen very often. The art is beautiful and the lords are fun, but the memory aspect is annoying.

EDIT: It's much better at 4 players than with 2. It fixes the balance issues around exploring as well as the pearl economy. It slows down quite a lot though, which is not ideal.

So nice artwork but what an annoying game. Firstly it consists of ca. 40% of a repetitive boring auction. Secondly some of the lord cards (as well as locations) are extremely powerful. The timing when they show up is game breaking. Therefore the game has severe balancing issues or in other words is too much dependent on the luck of the draw.

First of all, what a refreshing theme! It doesn't affect the gameplay too much but it add a really cool mood to it. 

Cool, smooth gameplay and interesting decisions to the base set collecting game. You get to make decisions during other player's turns, so you don't feel like you're just waiting for your next turn.

The incredible production values show everythere, from the components to the art, which is probably the best I've ever seen on a boardgame.

Played two player and had a great time. There are several mechanics that drive this game, but they are incorporated in to a very cohesive, solid game. The decisions can be tough, and it can be a little mathy at times, but it really is fun, and the art is freaking gorgeous!

RATING: 5
Clever combination of simple mechanics, and I liked the fact that each color of lord has a distinct type of ability. (So if you need pearls, picking up green allies is more appealing than if you have plenty of pearls but need points.)

But the monster track seems clunky (nobody lets it get past the second space) and so that big stack of locations also goes mostly unused. That left an odd taste in my mouth-- not a bad taste, but also one that's unlikely to ever seem PERFECT for a given occasion, so I am not sure whether I'll play it.

A resource management game where you collect allies (cards) and pearls (money) in order to purchase lords (victory points) and districts (bonus victory points). The actions available on your turn are simple enough, but the interactions and dependencies can be a little obtuse. I won the game by a sizeable margin, but I think it was mostly due to luck of the draw and the player before me making sub-optimal choices that benefited me greatly.

The artwork for the game is interesting. I really like it as art, but I think it hinders the gameplay. Simplicity would enhance the playability.

Abyss is one of the easiest games to teach that I know of. It is beautiful, it only in its illustration but in the simplicity of its design. The flow of the game allows it to be taught in stages.

Of course, the game is also fun and interactive. As a good Euro will, it offers many paths to victory so that any gamer personality can pursue one that appeals to him or her. Turns are quick; and the most common action gives every other player a potential way to be involved even when they aren't the active player. 

Abyss does all this in a solid 30-45 minutes of fun! A great game, all around!

RATING: 8
I don't care about what the critics say, the game is nearly as good as it is pretty, and it is VERY pretty.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There is nothing really innovative in the design, but it still feels unique. A couple of mechanics seem rushed and don't work quite well, while luck of the draw and even sitting order may often be significant, but the game has some undefinable quality that makes it very pleasant to play. I got it in mid-November and it already is my most played game of the year! The attractive undersea civilization theme, despite its loose implementation, and the absolutely gorgeous artwork definitely help.

Just one criticism regarding the production: the plastic pearls are a nice touch, but their functionality is terrible. Being spherical, they need deep recipients that make it hard to see how many the other players have, and if they fall off the table, they can be a real pain to catch. If they just had a flat side, both problems would have been solved.

Some stupid stuff in it:  the board and components are really stupid.  You need a cup to keep the "pearls" in, the board is too big.  Some cards are too big, and some are too small.

On your turn you can do one of three things :

1. Draw card out and ask if any player wants that card. The player that wants the card pays one pearl to the active player. If a player buys a card the second card would cost two pearl to get the card instead. Each player are only allowed to buy cards once from active player

If he or she does not want then the active player continues drawing cards until te sixth card is revealed unless he or she wanted a card revealed after all other players do not want that card. The active player gets that card and one pearl

After the active player selects the card of his or her choice the cards are placed faced down onto respective colour piles

2. Active player may select a pile colour and take all discarded cards of the cards player did not select earlier on from action 1. Note that players can only choose one action and cannot choose multiple actions.

3. Buy a lord. Pay the cost of The Lord according to the color cost. It has to be exact and has to be of multiple colours to add up if it is stated on the card.

I like this simple to learn and play mechanic where everyone can interact to make the game fun to play. Quite themetic as the game portrays the underwater depths of the deep ocean monsters creatures and lords. 

This game played up to 4. Nothing bad to critic. Would recommend this for newbies or new to noardgamingZ the artwork is excellent which makes the game thematic and fun to play

Quite a solid entry level mid-weight game. But was a little too simple for my liking because of how the combinations are driven by color matching. There's good and bad in such a simple mechanic but I lean towards a more open ended interpretation of card play (like seasons).

I really enjoyed the expansion, Abyss: Kraken with the addition of the deficit pearls (Nebulis) It elevated the game play to a solid 7.25 because of the interesting use of such a simple mechanic.

Collect sets, to collect sets, to collect sets. It's all about points in the end. The artwork and design of Abyss has to be commended, it's very good. 
This game has gotten a few plays and we've enjoyed it. The variety comes into playing the Lord powers well, and capitalizing on points from the locations. Not super competitive but there is some "take-that" with the military lords. Once explained the game is fairly quick and doesn't overstay it's welcome.

I like the art and components in Abyss, but not the gameplay. It's tactical, which is fine, but relies way too much on luck. It's hard to make a tactical decision when there is little indication of what the next card up will be. Even better is when the card one desperately needs appears and gets purchased before even having the opportunity to do so.

As a result, I really don't see myself playing this game again anytime soon.

The imagery is very nice. Just as the gameplay itself. It is fast-paced once you get the roll of it. I am a fan of ornaments and I love how there are pearls in a shellbox etc. However, maybe it lacks a bit of depth in the abilities.

Beautifully produced game. The theme doesn't matter at all, but I love that it's there. This plays very well at all player counts, and anyone can pick it up quickly. It's a great thing to pull off the shelf as just BARELY more than a gateway game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2015)

Many geek friends said that Abyss has gorgeous art and components and they were right, the art of the game is AMAZING, one of the best I have seen. The gameplay is also fun so I was pleasantly surprised by it. 

The rules are very simple, but the decisions aren’t (I love this). It has interesting decisions (how many location tiles to review? the more you see the more options your opponents will get, how much to pay? With which cards to pay?, which Lord to buy?).

Abyss plays at a fast pace so there is very little downtime.

The theme is rather thin, in fact, I’m not sure what are we supposed to be doing in the game or why.

The game has lots of auctions and I enjoy that, but memory also plays an important factor, a huge plus for me (I love mechanisms that depend on memory).

Luck is also present in many ways, but I’m still not sure if it plays a decisive role, I need to play more times to verify this point.

Bottom line, I was surprised I liked Abyss (one of my favorite Cathala´s after Mr. Jack). It is a light-medium game but a fun one. I want to play it again soon and I will probably keep it in my game collection. I like it more than Five Tribes.

Fun set collection game with the addition of special abilities and point multipliers. Nice light but strategic game.  Fighting the monster seemed like a kind of broken press your luck mechanic - although I have only played 2 player so maybe it is more important in a 4 player game.  Have not tried the expansion yet but am eager to do so, seems promising.

RATING: 8
Abyss is a great game, which I played a lot as a 2-player game with my partner, and also with several friends - everyone likes it. It's a medium-level game, with simple mechanics yet the possibility to refine your strategy. The artwork is of a rare quality and the little plastic pearls are a pleasure to handle. I love that you can choose from 3 possible actions during your turn, it makes the game really dynamic. Maybe the theme has been pasted on the mechanics, but it's highly enjoyable nonetheless.

RATING: 7
Beautiful artwork, felt a little overproduced—a really huge board that didn't hold all the components because it was mostly artwork. A cool game, but could've been a much smaller (and cheaper) card game. I'd play it again, but probably wouldn't be interested in buying it.

Very beautiful artwork! The game play is not too complex although gives you a few different choices each turn. I like the fact that you are engaged during other players' turns also. I'm not sure this game will work as well with just 2 players though. I think we will probably pick up the expansion down the track.

RATING: 4
Hugely thematic and beautiful artwork combined with entirely mechanical and unthematic set collection card play. The game is simply a frame around a rather clumsy card-drafting auction mechanic. You try to collect sets of cards to purchase larger cards that give you both special abilities and the ability to buy "locations" that give you end game scoring bonuses. So in short, you draft cards to buy cards to combine for yet a third card. Because, you know, the third card is exciting to get and all. 

Don't get me started on the "explore" action. You basically draw cards and offer them for sale to the other players. After they have purchased one card each or you draw 5 cards without taking any yourself, then you have to take the last card and get a bit of money. This makes the draft long, drawn out and undramatic, because the importance of a single card is not high. After a few rounds of this, you can simply take a pile of rejected cards which is FAR more valuable. Included in this is an entirely tacked-on "monster" mechanic which plays out more like a shopping list. That's okay, though, because, you know, you'll get the third card eventually. The THIRD CARD!!!!

Played Oct 2014

The art is so beautiful and the game play so mediocre, it's quite the juxtaposition! I played with many of the memory elements removed because I don't find that fun in any way. The buying of allies from opponents is fun, but brainless. Deciding which leaders to buy can be interesting and there is some hand management involved with that as well. There is nothing terribly deep about Abyss, which is quite funny, and a little sad because it looks so amazing. It would make a nice family game.



----------------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 2014

Kind of light card driven game of set collection, power collection, and sprinkles of both positive and negative player interaction. The Art is breathtaking! I would like to play this, but it isn't at the top of the list.

Such a super-elegant design. Meaty enough to sink your teeth into a bit but simple enough that newer gamers can still easily get their heads around it. Absolutely LOVE the engine building/breaking mechanic (though I think it works A LITTLE better in Elysium). Also...those production values...just, everything about this game is so well made. From the art to the pearls to the cards--stellar.

Never, EVER... play this as a two player game. This game auction mechanic and strategy shines with 3-4 players.

RATING: 6
Convoluted rules dress a simple basic three-tier system: set collection of base cards to acquire intermediate cards which allow to get final VP cards. At game end, all three types of cards provide VPs. The game is completed by the special powers some cards grant, a basic monetary system with very nice pearls and the abyss theming.

Lots of effort for not enough reward. The strength of the special powers can differ a lot, deciding the game early on. The atmospheric artwork doesn't generate enough excitement for me to fully enjoy the game.

This also happened with Animalia - everyone raves about artwork that I find adequate, but not inspiring. I should admit that my preferred artwork type (evocative, abstract) is probably not to everyone's liking, so I don't expect others to share my opinion.

The game places such a heavy emphasis on the artwork that the lack of theme or back story is almost comic. What exactly are we doing? Why?

The mechanics work just fine and I am engaged when I play. But there is nothing here that is new or unusual. There is no spark here that makes me want to play it repeatedly. I would definitely be open to playing it again, but I wouldn't suggest it.

RATING: 7
Not my style of graphics, but the game behind this is interesting. Quite an original way of collecting cards (allies). Although cards are drawn randomly, players have choice to pick it or to wait for a better one, but provide better opportunities for opponents. Choosing a location has also similar mechanics: you can have more choice, but then your opponents will have more choice as well. As usual, I have to play it more to say more.

Ne mano stiliaus grafika, bet pats žaidimas įdomus. Gana originalus būdas rinkti korteles (sąjungininkus). Nors kortos traukiamos atsitiktinai, žaidėjai renkasi, ar imti ne pačią geriausią kortą, ar palaukti geresnės, bet suteikti geresnių galimybių varžovams. Vietos pasirinkimas taip pat naudoją panašią mechaniką: gali turėti daugiau pasirinkimo, bet daugiau pasirinkimo turės ir varžovai. Kaip įprasta, turiu daugiau jį pažaisti, kad galėčiau pasakyti daugiau.

Love the three possible actions, and the interactions between them, love the lightning fast pace, love the Lords and their different types, they Key system and the sacrifices it entails, the push your luck of the Monster track, but my favorite part is the card management behind the federation of allies, where the lowest numbered card you use is added to your score pile. Mastering that part is a big part of my enjoyment of this game.

Abyss was a bit too light for our taste and some card powers are really mean can hurt the game state too much. My opponent got the red card that limits other players to 6 cards and after that you feel too restricted and she kinda didn't cover it for a long time playing slowly and that messed me so much. So that might be my main issue instead of game being light. The artwork is gorgeous though hard to pass on mentioning that.

Solid tableau builder that is also elegant in its action choices, notwithstanding a complex way in which to explain the game. On a player's turn they either auctions cards, take a pile of one color of cards, or buy a lord with a combination of colors and cards. The auction plays out in a nice press-your-luck style where the first card costs a pearl, the second a third, and so on. The player gets to keep the last card and all non-purchased cards go to the council to increase the card pools there. Lords are all worth different point values and have cool abilities attached to them. Was pleasantly surprised with this one, having no expectation or understanding of what it was before having played it.

RATING: 8.5
I LOVE Abyss. The amount of time and dedication into producing this game, in terms of artwork, it's unparalleled, if ranked only on artwork, it's be a solid 10. But sadly, the game only supports 4 players. I'd love to be able to accommodate 5-6, since it limits the playability because I can't play it in larger groups. It also has a higher learning curve. There are many subtle nuances to the game, that just escape some players, and since you have a bidding mechanic in the game, and bidding goes in order around the table, I've had some awkward situations where one player destroys the whole table, because the person in front of them in bidding order, just really doesn't grasp what they're doing... But given all those things, it still comes out every game night, and everyone asks for it. When you get 4 experienced players at the table, the game is nothing short of flawless...

Awesome game. It feels akin to 7 Wonders to me because of the excellent art and you're building your own empire in a way. The difference is the decision process is much richer.
It has that elegance of, you can do 1 of 3 things in your turn. One of my favorite decision making process happens with gaining Lords. There are two types of Lords really, those with Keys and long-lasting powers or those with no keys and one-time-use powers. Some of the long-lasting powers are awesome. The decision process I love comes when a player gets 3 Keys, they have to use those keys to gain a Location. A Location is final bonus points, but you lose the long-lasting powers those Lords gave you. So now you ache over the choice of losing these great turn-by-turn powers for a location with possibly great victory points.
I greatly appreciate the theme being represented here. It could have been aliens and looked like every other space game, but somehow making different races under water made it completely fresh. Every Lord card is awesome art (35 total). And for money you get Pearls in your own black plastic clam shell. The graphic design is solid as well.
I don't like to say things like "this may be one of my top ten games" when I first get a game because the "newness" is still there. Still... this might be one of my top 10 games. Definitely top 20.

Abyss is a game of development, combination and collection in which players try to take control of strategic locations in an underwater city. To achieve this, players must develop on three levels: first by collecting allies, then using them to recruit Lords of the Abyss, who will then grant access to different parts of the city. Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder — but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends.

What a strange experience. I had and do have problems with the game, but by the end of it (and since) have convinced myself I like it quite. I try to explain my ambivalent feelings in short. First of all, it is way bigger than it should - I'm sure when it was designed, it looked more like a Port Royal-like game with 150 cards and 30 coins, but now it's a big box game with dark but quality artwork and some amazing components including 'real' pearls that are just fine to be toying with in the downtime. The problem is, the game still feels like a small card game, and the mechanism is really something Port Royal-like: even though sometimes you have other options to choose from, in most of your turns you are going to turn up cards from a pile and while you are trying to get a good card, others are quite possibly going to buy some of these cards for 1, 2 or more pearls from you (the mechanism is different, but it still has push your luck and still a lot can depend on a card that is drawn at the right time). Then, just like in Port Royal, you can use combinations of these cards to get other cards (that give you VPs) for them. (These other cards can give you some abilities just like person cards in PR; also these other cards can make you get cities that give you some end game VP aims etc; the rules are a bit more complex but not as much as the 16-page rulebook suggests). For beginners the game can go too slow for what it is but in the second half of the game I could already see it goes with a fine speed. In the end, I liked it way more than Port Royal - while I appreciate that PR does not try to look more than a card game, this one is sold with a strongly thematic look and components that do suggest it's not an elegant tableau-building game but something with more emphasis on "take that" (just about the same way as the djinns in Cathala's other 2014 Essen game, Five Tribes). I like that this game knows what it is, even if it's overproduced as hell.

Played once, 4p. More Cathala style over substance. I hated this game intensely, and will never request it. This was definitely colored by getting seriously shafted one turn, essentially guaranteeing I couldn't place any higher than third. Even so, I still think the game is significantly influenced by luck of the draw. On the other hand, I can see why some people really like it, as you don't have to think about much, and the art is very impressive.

This is a game that seemed to be everywhere not long ago, but had never gotten played around me. When I saw it for cheap at Barnes and Noble I grabbed it, even though I shouldn't really do that sort of thing.

It's okay, nothing special. It feels like it started its life as something else (there's a strong feeling of "Magic the Gathering tie-in" to it) that then turned into an underwater type thing. It just kind of does its thing and then moves on, and I can't imagine having any strong feelings about it one way or the other.

This is one of the most beautiful games I own. The art is stunning, and the game is well balanced and easy to learn and teach. The game is straight forward and sneaks up on you with how fast i can end if you let it. Play for me is usually 30-45min. this is great as a 2, 3 or 4 player game. As someone who is always varying with number of available players that makes this game ideal. I havent played with anyone who hasnt enjoyed the game.
I highly recommend this to seasoned gamers and casual players.

This is a gorgeous game that's surprisingly simple to master. I absolutely love the theme (I'm actually wearing my mermaid leggings while typing this up). The artwork is perfectly ominous, and the way that the keys/locations work is fantastic. I love that fact that you lose powers after acquiring too many.

Plus, the pearls are amazing.

RATING: 5
Apparently this game was some kind of a big deal at GenCon 2014, so when a friend offered to teach it, sure why not? The art looked gorgeous anyway.

As soon as we started playing, I feared this was not my kind of game, with lots of random "take that" (discard cards because I bought this card you suckas!). To be fair, the rest of the game was kind of neat: a weird kind-of-auctioning of cards, the possibility to pick up the leftovers (which I grossly undervalued), and interesting scoring with the cards you pay with.

Especially once I realized the game would be over in a fraction of the time I feared, it wasn't nearly as bad as I initially, although my initial play was already ruined. I would actually like to play it again sometime.

RATING: 7.5
Pre-Essen 2014 buy. Initial thoughts are positive, this was a fun absract with some cool push your luck thrown in with special powers. Our first game was quite close, but only because I did not twist the knife and end the game earlier than I could have (was not sure I had enough to win). Interested to try this with more than 2, see how it plays.

Kraken expansion adds enough game to make this a 7.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Beautiful artwork and nice components. Comes with beautiful plastic pearls that are used as currency. They are not very functional however and its hard to see how much of each pearl people have hiding within the deep clam shell cups in front of them.  Be prepared to be asked "How many pearls do you have?" a lot.  This game may have been more functional with tokens but it would have loss some of its charm without the pearls so it was an interesting and ultimately acceptable design decision.

Overall, I was a little bored with this game.  The real appeal of the game is buying lords with special powers and being able to use those powers to your advantage.  Some of the lords have interesting powers but a lot of the ones that came up in our game were kind of boring.  "Take 2 pearls".... OK... Thanks I guess...  Some cards are a lot better than others and can screw over your opponents like the Assassin who can remove the special power of an opponent's lord.  Some have no power at all and are just victory points.

My biggest complaint is keeping track of all the powers and multiplying effects in the game (or potentially in the game).  It is just tiresome and not really fun in my opinion.  At one point I had the chance to gain some victory points from monster tokens so I did.  The next turn someone bought the lord to steal monster tokens and stole the token from me since I was the only one with tokens at that point. So you have to keep track of not only the half-dozen or so lords in play but also the potential instant effect lords that can be purchased.  It can be a lot to remember as your trying to plan your turns and also keep track of which cards are going into the council.

We had one person who really took the lead early on since he had played before.  There was very little we could do to slow him down or prevent him from getting more powerful.  There is quite a bit of luck (and press your luck) involved and if you get the right card draws you can really snowball and run away with the lead early on.

I would play this game again to see some of the other lord powers and try some different strategies but overall I was not blown away by this or feel the need to go out and own my own copy.    It is a beautiful game and I was hoping for a more enjoyable experience out of it.

Un mélange de jeu de prise de risques et de jeu de pioche de cartes. C'est vraiment bien fichu, même si je trouve l'édition trop sombre. La mécanique n'est pas follement originale, mais ça tourne vraiment très bien (et j'aime beaucoup les perles qui servent de monnaie).

RATING: 7
The graphic design on this game is very impressive.  The game is set collection and is not terribly innovative, but it does work very well.  You are collecting cards through a simple auction and you collect Lords of the Abyss.  The Lords provide special abilities and ultimately allow you to acquire lands.  

It is almost family weight in terms of complexity.  I liked the game and would play again.

I think this game suffered from over-hype and so expectations of the designer and artwork were very high. In the end the game delivers a really good experience. Not as good as the hype but much better than the naysayers give it credit for. This is a clever card game with some neat choices and obvious visual appeal. I really enjoy Abyss and I'd love to get the expansion.

RATING: 7
The game looks very good, has good quality components (e.g., the pearls and art), the rules are simple to teach and easy to remember, and it a match is not too long.  It has some innovative mechanics and some interaction.  It was designed by Bruno Cathala. In spite of all of the above, I was underwhelmed by my first play session.  I found that the gameplay was fairly repetitive, and the level of interaction was less than what I usually like.  In spite of the novel mechanics it was not particularly innovative, and the 90 minutes felt longer due to the repetitiveness.  I might change my mind on repeated plays, but so far I can think of other games of the same type that I prefer, like Elysium.

Played it again, and revising the score upward, with upward potential.  Good game length, especially with fewer players.  Better sense of the mechanics makes the tradeoff seem more consequential (for example, the careless loading of the discards favoring the following player).

My group is very much liking the act before your opponent type of games and this is a good one.
mechanics are easy to grasp.
doesn't work as well as I thought it would as a 2 player game (still ok).  

one surprising complaint I had in my game group was they felt like the game could have been physically slimmed down, a lot of wasted board space.  So I know many people (including myself) like the art but the flip side is the size.
A gripe of my own is the minimal impact the lord types had, like the game wasn't long enough to take advantage of it

My favorite mechanic in this game is the push-your-luck element where your opponents can pay a pearl to buy a card on your turn.

I love the artwork in this box. I love the bidding system in this game for the explore the deep. It is probably a lighter game than you would expect, but there are so many options in this game, it still stimulates the brain. The artwork is amazing. The "affiliated allies" mechanic also adds some depth to decision making. Oh yeah, did I mention the artwork? Phenomenal. Mechanically, I love what this game does. For some reason though, I hesitate to say this is a game with great legs. I think this game serves best as a next step game. If you have some non gamer friends that you have enticed with Catan, Ticket to Ride, King of Tokyo, or some other gateway game, this would do well as that next step.

This is a light eurogame where the only thing that makes it really interesting is the presence of hidden trackable information, which I don't appreciate.

I was prepared to dislike this game, as Cathala designs rarely go over well with me and I thought this one was all art. Turns out I like it quite a bit. I love that you have to give up special powers to move forward in the game, and that sometimes paying very efficiently scores the most points. These two points of unusual tension really make the game enjoyable. Add in some very minor push your luck and largely non-confrontational player interaction and this works very well for me.

Abyss war ein Blindkauf. Grund hierfür war das fantastische Artwork. Dahinter verbirgt sich aber auch ein sehr gutes Spiel. In der Tiefsee versuchen die Spieler die Gunst von "Edlen" zu gewinnen, Angehörige eines Unterwasservolkes. Doch dazu benötigen die Spieler Verbündete wie Quallen, Krebse oder Seepferdchen. Diese bekommt man durch einen spannenden "Auktionshaus"-Mechanismus. Die Spieler bieten reihum Perlen, oder enthalten sich eines Gebots. So stocken die Spieler ihren Vorrat an Perlen und ihre Handkarten an Verbündeten auf. Jeder Edle verlangt eine andere Kombination an Verbündetenkarten, die man ablegen muss. Einmal angeheuert, bieten die Edlen unterschiedliche Vorteile, die man anhand ihrer Kastenzugehörigkeit unterscheiden kann. Die Krieger blockieren die Mitspieler, die Händler sorgen für Perlennachschub und die Politiker manipulieren den Hof der Edlen. Außerdem bringen manche Edle einen Schlüssel mit. Hat man drei davon, kann man sich einen Ort aussuchen, der zusätzliche Siegpunkte generiert. Abyss ist ein zugängliches, spannendes und tolles Spiel.

Well, I should have known it would be good, Bruno designed it. I'm indifferent to the theme.  However, the artwork and components are very nice, as is the game play and mechanics.  I may like this one even more than Bruno's Five Tribes.

RATING: 7
Artwork is top notch and the risk/reward card draws are fun. The artwork is great, but the game is ultimately very thin on theme, which is a real shame because the idea behind the theme is really good. This is a fancy set collection game, make no mistake, but the pearl  economy and special powers make the game cool. The fact that the powers don't last the whole game (normally) means that the games don't break with certain bosses that come out, so I think that's a really smart design choice I'd like to see in other games. Some of the scoring tiles are imbalanced in my opinion, clearly not worth as many points.

So nice game with and without the expansion!
Love the Lords' special abilities and the VPs they give,
love the strategy about the collection and combination of the allies
but needs some time to calculate the VPs that each location gives you best...

Great game, simple mechanics so it is easy to teach new players, but duo to the simple mechanics I would consider it a light game, meaning there isn't much depth on the strategy of the base game but that can be fixed a little bit by using its expansion Abyss: Kraken.

An unique twist on push-your-luck mechanisms that I can really appreciate. Don't be fooled by the gorgeous art, there's still a really fantastic game here. I've found that it's a bit on the quirky side for a lot of people, as it can be difficult to learn and teach. I think this is probably my favorite game from Bruno Cathala, as it feels very unique in how it utilizes familiar mechanisms.

Not a bad game at all, but feels very overproduced compared to the gameplay.  I find myself wanting to own the game despite a very lukewarm experience with it so far, and that is pretty much completely due to the artwork and component quality.

 you to get more points or hang on to some powers instead of been lost in return for location....nice game experience after all......

After watching a live play by Grey Elephant I have upgraded this to "love to have." This game doesn't bring anything really new to the table as far as mechanics, but I love the theme and the amazing artwork and components. It is a surprisingly light game that looks like it would play fairly quickly and therefore make a nice gateway game.

This game feels very overlooked to me. I don't see many people raving about it and I believe it deserves that treatment.

I was worried that this game was all artwork before I played, but I'm a huge believer in Bruno Cathala (also Five Tribes) and Xavier Collette (Dixit: Journey, Timeline, etc).  As it turns out, it's a very fun game with a unique auction mechanism.  And those pearls...yes!  Beautiful game on the lighter side of medium depth and definitely worth having.

I should not have traded this one away. I am not a fan of "gateway games", but I can see the need for them in a collection now. This game has fantastic art, it is easy to teach, and it is relatively quick to play for a non-filler game. This will never be my favorite game because it is too simple but it has a decent amount of variety and it is terrific to play with people that are not seasoned board game players.

Rating based on 1 play during CanCon (Canberra Australia).

A simplistic set collection which has a nicely implemented push your luck element. Sets are used to purchase lords, who have keys to location boards which are are the main sources of victory points. Location boards had strong similarity to purple guild cards in Seven Wonders. The game is actually very simplistic in play and strategy, but seems to be disguised as an in depth strategy boardgame. Artwork and components are exquisite. However functionality wasn't so good, although the pearls are quite aesthetic, they can easily roll all over the place if not in the cup and are difficult to count when within the cup. The yellow and green faction lords could hardly be distinguish by background colour, especially once a location board is on top covering the main icon. Location boards are overkill in size, cannot be shuffled easily, should have been cards. Game seems to be a race to the location cards and I didn't like the fact they cancelled the lords ability, making the game simpler and less meaningful. To play the game well you shouldn't push your luck and aim to deny other players the cards they need. This prolongs the game and wasn't that fun; you don't plan your strategy as much. No real desire to play again but would play if suggested or decided by others.

Abyss has been praised for its stunning art. After playing the game I cannot disagree. As for the game play, I found Abyss to be enjoyable but forgettable. It had some neat mechanisms that I enjoyed.

RATING: 7
The game is an acquisition spree in which you curate your holdings as best you can, primarily on a tactical level. On a first play it felt like the game was playing me -- I was off rhythm and it seemed like everyone was playing to the eventual winner's strengths -- certain combos were either game-breaking or will take more experience as a group to solve. In particular, an approach that ignores the powers of other players won't cut it. I think, viewed as a disposable game (i.e., played quickly like a card game, knowing that luck of the draw is a fundamental component), Abyss works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pardon the pun, but the game lacks... depth.

Not necessarily a bad thing, but it masks the mid-level Rio Grande Game that it is with over-the-top production values that add nothing to the game but the illusion of depth.  I have no need to play this game again.  It's not bad, but... overhyped.  There's others from 2014 I'd rather play, starting with Mysterium and ending with Tragedy Looper.

[b]Abyss[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/12/15. (Received Wasabi)

[i]- One of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, really, the art is amazing.
- Top notch components as well (especially the pearls and seashell cups to hold them).
- Some interesting interactions between the lords/locations.

Basically Abyss is a set collection game with all kinds of special abilities which effect game play and scoring, but a lot of your strategy is dictated by the randomness of the lord/location draws. I prefer games like Battle Line or Morels which allow for more long term planning and bluffing; games where you have knowledge of what cards are available and knowing you will most likely see every card in the game.

In my opinion Abyss is an average game with beautiful artwork. I think it works well as a family game if you are looking for a relatively light game with a fair amount of randomness. For me the decision space felt too constrained and not very deep.[/i]

Wow, what beautiful artwork. This is a really neat looking game. The powers of the Lords are nice, the game-play is fast-paced and all round just really smooth.

Don't let the artwork fool you; this is a set collection card game that is decidedly on the light side. You won't be exploring the depths of the ocean. A pond maybe. The interaction is mostly either of the indirect denial type or the "screw you because I have a card that says I can" variety. The pearls used for currency, even though players have a clam shell to store them in become annoying due to rolling over the table and players unable to resist spinning them in the clam shells. The art is great but the cards really have to sleeved as the quality is poor.  All in all, a fun game but does not justify the price nor the size of the box.

RATING: 6
Abyss is a set collection card game--you're trying to collect cards of certain values and colors to claim one of a number of "lords" that are available.  Each lord requires a certain total numerical value, a certain number of different colors, and a required color that has to be among the cards turned in.  These cards are obtained through a bizarre non-auction auction, where the auctioneer flips over a card, and the first person in turn order that wants that card can pay a fixed cost to the auctioneer.  Both the auctioneer and the bidders have minimal control over what gets flipped and who gets what, since the price isn't fixed by the auctioneer and no one has a chance to outbid, so what cards players end up involves a lot of luck.  The lord cards themselves give players special abilities, and sets of lords can be turned in for end-game scoring "locations", which negate the lords' special abilities (but not their victory points).  Since the whole thing ultimately derives from the initial cards, though, you really don't have much control over who ends up with what.  There's just a ton of luck here.

The game has beautiful artwork and theme.  There are several different options in gaining allies to recruit the lords.  I like some of the press-your-luck when going in the abyss.  There is decent interactivity in racing for lords/activating them and going for bonuses.

The game seemed to be a little clunky with the going in the abyss for allies and the pearl payments.  Some of the lord abilities seemed to be overpowered and dominated the game.

While it is light, there are also interesting choices and different ways combine cards  that can either make certain actions better or create end game scoring synergies.

Troll face the board game is art of the year? I don't get it. While the artwork is technically skilled it is either disturbingly ugly or whimsically bland. This has to be the most overrated artwork of any board game I have seen yet. The box covers all have a creepy vibe and the card art work is joyless. The only thing I can figure out is board gamers are largely blind to beauty and have a deranged obsession with freakish art.

The game itself is just a bunch of components and mechanics jumbled together so the artwork could be sold in a box as a "game". I had no idea it was so easy to literally troll gamers like this.

Enjoyed this short cardflippy set collection game. In this game you collect colored cards, and then spend those cards to buy other cards that give you special effects, and may have keys printed on them, which you use to buy these boards that give you lots of endgame VPs for having collected a certain thing or things over the course of the game. I'd be happy to play this again, but nothing about it makes it really stand out in the world of eurogames. I don't know that I'd feel the need to pull this off the shelf in place of any other game.

Set collecting with simple mechanics although some players will struggle with why a rule is the way it is. For instance, one of the actions you take is to reveal cards until you find one you want to take. However, each card you reveal is first offered to everyone else in turn order. They have first chance to buy the cards you are revealing. Art and production value is insane...worth playing once for that alone. Another player commented on the board lacking the same art quality of the other components. I really like it because of the perspective of the "court" it represents. Would definitely play again although I will probably not purchase.

I was kind of surprised at how much I liked this game despite hearing so much "meh" online about it. I think the initial hype and hate over the multiple box arts kind of deflated the excitement, or that people were expecting some sort of really meaty game with a lot of moving parts.

Abyss is a fine game, but it is by no means a meaty thematic experience. The art and design are gorgeous, but have little to do with actual gameplay. I'm totally fine with that, since the mechanical aspects of the game are fun and easy to pick up.

Nice game for both "beginner" and "experienced" players. No ground-breaking mechanisms but it works and trying to optimize your lords/locations feels pleasant. 

I like the "press your luck but you offer options to your opponent(s)" mechanism. It offers a little interaction besides the red lords.

played only 4-p configuration.

A lot of fun elements going on here.  Had some brain cramping at first on what the optimal choices were.  Game ends faster than you think. Draft an ally, draft all refused allies of a certain faction, or buy the assistance of a Sea Lord.  Sea Lords will grant you keys to buy locations to help your final score.  So it's a victory point race, but this gorgeous game is a lot simpler than observers will think when watching from a distance.

You're one of the nobles in the underwater society of The Abyss. Garner the respect of the citizens and the council to be crowned the next Lord of The Abyss. This game is what I think Splendor should strive to be; it has a great theme and the mechanics are great. The player-to-player interaction is intuitive as well as the set-collection. The cards offer variable powers to make each game feel unique. The pearls are a really nice touch to the game.

This game was an instant favorite. One of the few hits of Gen Con 2014. Every action just flows into every other action so smoothly. Exploring is a great push-your-luck mechanic that gets all the players involved. Which locations get revealed change every game, which helps replay-ability. Each faction has a particular focus. Soldiers are more confrontational while Merchants give you precious pearls. It's hard to pick a favorite, since each seem to give important support  towards the end goal.

This game missed the mark for me slightly.  It was pretty fun and I would play it again.  I just wouldn't be asking for it.

First, the game moves just a little too slowly due to the mechanics of the game.  Exploring the depths with a single card, then players have the option to buy before drawing the next...yeah, that's too slow.  If you draw into all the cards to begin then each other player decides to buy all at once...maybe?

The end-game trigger of 7 lords seemed too much as well.  It just draws the game out for me.  5 lords...maybe?

I love the pearls though.  Awesome.

Sept. 2015: From where I sit, in summer of 2014 the hype for it was huge and the preview card art was loved.  Then the game was out and lots of people were disappointed that the game play wasn't so deep.  Then it wins a bunch of art awards and more people who had no preconceived notions of it played it and really liked it.  So long story short, I got interested in it 12 months after it came out, picked up a dented copy, and I've loved it.  Wife and friends really like it too.  Fast to play.  Better with 3 players than just 2.  Terrific components.  Highly recommended!

I'd had my eyes on this one since well before it was released, but I don't need to buy it because another of our gaming group did, and I don't feel this game is great enough to merit buying a copy of our own.

Abyss is intimidating to play for the first time. The scoring mechanism is very involved, consists of multiple phases and is not easy to explain. I honestely defy anyone to truthfully say they understood how scoring worked the first time they played!

The box is good quality and the artwork there and on the cards is great. The pearls for currency are a nice touch, but they're quite impractical during play as they're very small and the little storage containers are easy to knock over - sending the tiny pearls flying. While they look nice, I think some other way of representing currency would have made more sense.

Once you figure out gameplay, things move quickly enough. However, the choices all feel fairly lackluster. At the start, you can really just choose to deal cards while others get the opportunity to buy one from you for varying amounts. Later, you can take a pile of face down cards (generally 1 and 2 point value, so card counting isn't necesary!). Or you can buy the loyalty of one of the Aquatic Lords. While this kind of list of choices isn't new in this kind of game, it just seems less exciting than I'd like.

The variety of lords you can buy is good, including the Crab race that don't score many points but do inflict negative effects on your opponents - this is a good mechanism. 

Overall, I think that there are a number of good mechanisms in play here that don't really work together in a fun way - leads me to think of this as a pretty average game.

08-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Abyss is one of the Cathala games from 2014. I was late to the party, playing it almost a year after the release.

In Abyss you are some are trying to get influence points, by buying lords, playing allies (with values 1 to 5) and getting control over locations. Each round you can take 1 action. Actions are buying lords, searching the depths and taking cards previously searched and stored in a stack of the color on the board..

There are two currencies in the game, ally cards and pearls. Pearls are wild resources value of 1. Ally cards can be collected in two ways, but in essence are cards of a color and a value (so blue 5). You buy lords, by paying in certain amount of allies cards (in various color combinations depending on the lord). Interesting is that the lowest played Ally is 'scored' at the end for points for each color. If you ever reach 3 key symbols, you buy a location tile, which give you VPs based on certain conditions (like 6+ 4 per blue lord). 

You get allies by flipping cards and offering the cards to your opponents. If an opponent buys a card, you get 1 pearl. IF the second also buys a card, you get 2 pearls. Max 5 of these cards can be opened at the end of your round.

I do like the game. I felt it was a little simplistic, but otherwise interesting. In a weird way it felt to me like a gamers version of TtR.

Abyss is an amazing game with outstanding artwork, beautiful theme and fun, yet simple mechanics.

The biggest complaints I hear about this game are 
1. The cover of the box - yes, I agree this a creepy face I don't want staring out of my game collection shelf.  With all the beauty in the game, they could have chosen just about anything else.
2. The theme just seems 'painted on' and has nothing to do with the game.  Fair enough, but can't this be said about many games that are in the top 100?

This was a must buy for us.  We love games that scale well from 2-4 players.

My favorite game released in 2014.  

The gameplay is fast, easy to teach, and extremely fun.  The superb artwork elevates the experience, as well as the tactile feel of the pearls used as currency.  A simply gorgeous game that I will play any time someone asks, and I suggest it all the time also.  Plays just as well with two players as with 4.  

Can't think of a single thing not to like, as this ranks easily in my top 10 of all time.  The only thing keeping it from being higher is at times I prefer a heavier game. But this gets played a lot more than those heavies, of course!

I really enjoy the three tier mechanics in this game. 

1. First I can recruit to the council, fight some sweet sea-monsters along the way. 

2. Secondly, I can just grab the aid of the senate which I need at the time. I choose you shell people!

3. Lastly, the Lords. I dig those guys. Especially the Elder, he's super O.P. hence it always being a race when he comes up.

Just a really tight, slick game that looks gorgeous.

First off, this is a beautiful game.  Some of the graphic design choices are a little off, but the art is excellent.  I think the theme is a bit weird and the "monster" mechanic is also odd since you always defeat it.  The pearls, though nice and tactile, are impractical, even with the cups.  It's a decent, lighter game, but it also looks like it requires four players.  Glad I played it before buying it, because doing so will save me the trouble of buying it.

[1 play] Perfect example of a game I'm happy to play anytime, but feel no need to own. That is my personal definition of a "7". If it's an 8, I often feel like I probably should own it, so that I can have it available as an option to play at any time.

Anyway, about Abyss ...

The artwork is cool (Ruthie walking by thought it was really beautiful), the game plays out as an interesting card game should, and the special powers are interesting but don't overpower or break the game as can happen sometimes. The theme is strange and wonderful if you go for that style. I've however, become a bit jaded over recent years by the artistic Fantasy Flightation of so much game artwork. (Yes, I suppose other people would feel much the same if it had been themed in the Renaissance).

This is a rambling review, so I apologize and will attempt a brief summary:

Abyss is fun, pretty simple when you get into it, and the theme and artwork will have great appeal for many people.

Everyone knows by now that the artwork for this game is just gorgeous. I picked up one of the alternate game box covers at GenCon too. But it's also a really solid game. It gives me the same feel as 7 Wonders, even though it has many differences. I like the way you need to think about recruiting allies for end game points, and the fact that you can gain locations, but in order to do so, you'll have to lock up some lords and lose their in-game abilities. Including little pearls as the currency is also a nice touch. This game pushes so many 'love' buttons for me. I need to play it even more!

I received this game for Christmas last year, shortly after I got into board games. I am a sucker for artwork and that's the only thing I knew about this game when I put it on my list for Santa ha! The game is fairly light and easy to teach new players. There is a little bit of room for "take that" interaction but you are largely trying to collect sets, build cards for points/abilities, and collect location tiles that add score multipliers. The one complaint I have about the game is its "explore" action. You have a deck of smaller cards that you must draw/place o the board one at a time. Opponents get a chance to buy a card by giving you a pearl, if all pass, you can take the card. Otherwise, you keep drawing until the board is full, collecting the last card in the row along with 1 pearl. I like everything about this process except for the fact that all cards that weren't purchased/claimed get stacked in their specific color groups and placed face-down in an area of the board where the next player can scoop them all up in one turn. I suppose this adds to the "push your luck" nature of exploring. If you choose to collect a card early on in the explore action, then there's less cards to put back on the board. All in all, I'll be keeping this game in my collection as a great intro game for people with beautiful visuals to lure them in (pun intended lol).

I have one word for this game, gorgeous! The artwork is phenomenal and I think it will be a long time before another game will even come close to matching the beauty to be found here.

That being said, while it's not at all difficult to get me excited about an underwater themed game, mixing it with politics automatically reduces my enthusiasm.

For me, the gameplay for this one doesn't quite match the beauty of it's artwork. While the game is a fun politically themed, set collection game at it's core, I wish this one could have delivered better gameplay to match it's beautiful artwork.

It also doesn't help that I have only ever managed to win this game twice out of the numerous times it has hit the table.

Good game, quite some variation, interesting decisions without being overly brainy. The character powers are interesting and the different ways to score points lock into each other in multiple ways, which produce interesting dilemmas.
But: The game does not play too well as a two-player-game. Three or four players seems almost necessary. For two players, some kind of variant would be needed.

A bit over-produced, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Quite an enjoyable game.  One of the things that confuses me though is how few locations actually seem to make it into play during the game.  If all you collect is key lords, you'll generally only have 2 locations under control.  And only around 50% of the lords are key lords.  With such a huge stack of potential locations, it seems like only around 4 make it out in our 3 person games.

Mikor megláttam rácsodálkoztam, ilyen gyönyörű játékkal ritkán találkozik az ember. Sikerült kipróbálni is. 1-5 erősségű lapokat gyűjtünk, amivel Lord lapokat veszünk, amik vagy azonnali vagy tartós képességgel rendelkeznek és győzelmi pontot is érnek. Egyes Lordokon kulcs szerepel, amivel helyszínt szerzünk, ami még bónusz győzelmi pontokat hoz. Tudunk szörnypontokat is szerezni. Nagyon egyszerű mechanizmus, nagy szerencsefaktor, de gyors játék. Minden játékosszámmal rendben működik. Igazából nálam ez egy 6-os játék lenne, de a gyönyörű grafika és kivitel miatt muszáj egy plusz pontot adnom.

I absolutely LOVE this game! It has quickly become one of my all-time favorites! There are many reasons for this, which other reviewers have already stated more eloquently than I could, but one big reason is that it appeals to the non-gamers I know (the ones who, when they think "board game", think "Monopoly" or some other vanilla game). And that means that I get to play it more often!
It plays well with 2, 3, or 4 players. The box has a storage space for everything, and I LOVE that! I wish more companies were that thoughtful in designing the box insert. 
I'm looking forward to the expansion, "Kraken", being released in November!

This game just works so well and is so smooth. Everyone is usually involved in each turn and turns are really quick. Works great with 2 and with 4, although 4 lasts a little longer than I would like. However, I'm puzzled why they have a localized English language edition but did not put the type of Lord right on the card; that would simplify the locations for new players. I rarely look forward to expansions, but I can't wait to see what the Black Pearl adds (other than some mysteriously colored pearls)!

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er, 4/2015

It's a pretty straightforward game, although it was late and it took us longer than it should have to finally get it! It's a set-collection game with push-your-luck element (going for more monsters, or better cards) and some very nice artwork. The lord powers add some direct interaction sometimes, in addition to the fact that everyone else has the right of first refusal when you flip a card. That last thing, though, was kind of annoying since it seems to slow the game down as you wait. You don't wait long, but it feels ... awkward?

Decent game, worth trying again when I'm more awake, but I doubt I'll ever think of this as great.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
On your turn, you either:
- explore: one at a time, draw from a deck of cards (several types, each with numbers 1-5). Opponents get first crack at each card, paying you in pearls (# = # of cards taken already + 1); if no one else wants it, you can take it for free and end your turn. Or, draw again. Max 5 cards, and you get the 5th. Place all other revealed cards in their respective piles face down. If you reveal a sea monster, there's a "fight" of sorts: you win automatically and get some extra resources (better ones if you've pushed your luck and flipped more monsters), then continue your turn.

OR

- take one of those face down piles

OR

- spend cards to buy a lord (they show up in a card row). These cost different combinations of suit and number requirements. The lords are worth VP at game end, and may give you special powers (and/or keys) until you lock them. 

Then, if you have 3 keys, you must spend them to get a location. These lock down a lord (canceling his power), and are worth VP at the end of the game. They have a variety of mechanisms for VP (e.g., double lords value, based on cards in your hand). 

The game ends when someone gets 7 lords, or the Lords deck runs out. There may have been additional end-game VP (pearls remaining, cards in hand, etc.). The player with the most points wins!

Considering my predilection for heavier games I'm quite surprised how many lighter games lately have really been winning me over.  In fact this is the second Bruno Cathala game that I would have expected to be more style than substance that has found a home on my shelf over the past couple months (with the other being Five Tribes).

In this game players are competing for the favor of lords belonging to 5 different underwater tribes (heh).  Gameplay, as I mentioned, is reasonably simple.  On your turn you can do one of 3 things.  1.  Explore, which is done in a neat way mechanically.  You reveal cards from a deck which give you influence in the different tribes and you can take one card you reveal into your hand for free but you always have to offer it to your opponents to buy first.  So opponents exploring on their turns can sometimes be a lot more beneficial to you than doing it yourself.

2.  After exploring all unclaimed cards go into piles seperated by the five different tribes.  Another action you can do is simply take one of these piles.

3.  Finally, once you've acquired enough influence in the appropriate tribes you can hire lords.  These are the most interesting part of the game.  The lords give you different abilities and point values and cost different combinations of influence to acquire.  The lords also set the pace of the game since it ends when the lord area can't be refilled or a player hires 7 or more of them.

For how simple it is the mechanics present a lot of interesting decisions and it intrigued me quite a bit.  Like Five Tribes, I don't know if I was just surprised by the depth this game offered or I just didn't grok it in my first play, but I got creamed and can't wait to play it again and hopefully improve my position.  Also, the board and bits look great.  It has a great insert that holds and separates everything and I especially love the little pearls used for currency but be careful with pets and small children around.  I will say that the council areas where ally cards are discarded is busy and blends with the cards themselves making it difficult to gauge when and how many cards are in each pile and the yellow and green colors can be hard to tell apart but those are minor gripes.

BEAUTIFUL artwork and top-notch components.  Slightly less than mediocre gameplay, however, drags this one down a couple notches.

Reevaluation elevates this rating slightly.  A change in perspective -- this game is not a board game at all, it's a card game.  And it's a decent card game, barely good, perhaps; and again, the art is amazing.

So, up to 6 it goes.

More hype on my gaming table! I didn't buy this, as I felt most of the hype was simply based on the great artwork. And it is lovely to look at, but great artwork does not make a good game. In some cases it even bothers actually playing the game *cough*FFG*cough* After just having played [thing=157354][/thing], playing more Cathala games does sound appealing though.
This game has us collecting cards with a fun twist and then using those cards to buy other cards that give us a combination of points and abilities. Some of those cards have keys on them which give you even more points and abilities, but they also take away some abilities as soon as you have 3 keys.
This is a pretty typical superfiller. It plays fast, it has a good amount of strategy and tactical choices and a good dose of luck with a short playing time. Good stuff, but nothing spectacular. And the awesome artwork can't hide the fact that there is no theme.

RATING: 6
Abyss is a charming family game with some gentle set collection and push your luck, undermined by theme which makes it much  less playable. The colours of each set are a bit murky and dark and how they relate to the theme makes no sense to me at all - and so collecting the land that scores you for 'political leaders' really could have been any of the colours.

It's beautiful to look at, but I don't think anyone will still be playing this in 3-5 years.

Update: This is very nearly a really good game; I love the idea of most of what you do benefiting other players - exploring makes cards available to other players, taking one costs you pearls, going looking for a specific card fills up the sets for people to swoop in and take, looking at lots of scoring lands makes more available for others, but the game just doesn't quite hold together for me. The lands are swingy and variable, the game is just too fiddly for a family game, and the attack cards are too punishing for a player to be able to make themself immune. A shame as there's a lot of interesting design decisions in here.

Rating down from 7 to 6.

RATING: 4
I did not enjoy playing a 4 player game at all.

During the exploration phase, we all wanted the big fish (value 3 and up) and monsters, so we cycled through the deck a lot. After a while, it gets annoying to ask every other player "do you want this?" over and over again.

There is much text to read, and it is important text. From the other end of the table, it is hardly readable, so it takes a while to read and analyze all the available Lords and Locations.

Others have commented on specific killer combinations of Lord cards. We suffered from a 6 ally-cards hand limit.

The pearls look and feel great, however with 4 blokes in our game, we were sometimes handling them like coins (throwing them on the board), which resulted in pearlfising under the table. I know this "fits the theme" of the game, but it is something to watch out for.

The art may be great, but its colors are very dark, and since the cards were sleeved, they reflected a lot of the ambient light.

Repetitive, overstays its welcome after 30 mins, will not get this to the table again, so my rating is rather forgiving!

Not my kind of fish.

I'm a little torn about Abyss. I like card drafting and enjoyed some of the mechanics of Abyss. That said, the powers of the Lords are all over the board, and players lucky enough to be in position to draft the ones with the best powers will sail on to victory. Some lords also will hose players downstream from them, such as the one that allows a player to take two (instead of one) piles of allies from the council, ensuring that the player going next pretty much never has the option to nab a good pile. In short, balance seems to be an issue here, but the game is interesting and quick enough that I'll try it again.

The game itself is a fairly simple and straightforward set-collection game.  The size of the box, the extravagant art and the unique theme gives the impression it will be something more.  It's not a bad game.  It's maybe even a good game (though definitely not a great one).  But I don't think the production is the right match.  I'd prefer it to be a smaller and cheaper game that focuses less on the art and more on functionality and readability.

RATING: 8
A brilliant set collection game that's full of nuance and subtlety within its simple exterior.

There's a simple system where you take one of three actions on your turn. Players are always engaged because if you try to collect cards from the deck, your opponents first have a chance to buy them before you have the option to keep them. Timing is hugely important because you can collect cards as long as you want, but eventually you need to cash them in and buy some Lords to get their abilities and points.

Awesome game, rating could even go up with more plays.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3+[/b]
The two player game is just okay but with three or more there is more interaction and there are more decisions about when to pass up buying a card for a pearl.

I saw video reviews of this game and didn't think it looked interesting, then I played it.

However, it even feels like politics in that you can't refuse them from taking that exploration card you wanted, but you do get pearls so you can now do the same to them.

A very good Euro. The weight is just right. Though the game has multiple mechanics and VP sources, they flow well into each other. The game errs on the side of being too short. Like any game in which players can build an engine, you would not want a run away engine to bore other players, but the game seems to cut out before engines can really get going.

The theme does not really make sense, though.

RATING: 7
This game really seems simple at first glance. You do one of three things on your turn. Buy a lord. Start an auction. Or take a stack of cards.

When you start an auction you flip up an "affiliate" card from the deck, which is basically money, value 1 to 5, which comes in one of five "creature flavors"... these are the cards you spend to buy lords. So you flip up a card and everybody else has a chance, in clockwise order from you, to buy the card.

The person to buy the first card pays you a pearl. If someone buys that card, you flip another card and repeat the process, but now the cards cost an extra pearl (it goes up a pearl every time someone buys a card). If the card ever comes back around to you, you can take it for free. Or you can push your luck and keep flipping until you have five revealed cards, at which point you take the last card you flipped and a bonus pearl for going to the last card.

The cards that weren't taken are separated by creature flavor and put in separate piles, adding to any cards from previous auctions that still haven't been taken. On your turn you can just take one of these piles.

Finally, you can spend affiliate cards to buy lords. Lords have varying costs, and you must pay with cards of the appropriate creature type(s). You can use pearls to make up the cost if you're a little short. Most lords give victory points and some have powers or instant abilities, although some just give points, typically more than those with cool abilities. Additionally, most of the lords with cool powers also possess a key. When you acquire three keys, you must spend those lords to acquire a location, which give you points. The spent lords still score for you, but you can't use their abilities anymore. The lord row only refills when it gets down to two lords. Before that you can spend a pearl to add the top (facedown) lord on the lord deck to the row.

The game ends when one player has seven lords or the deck of lords runs out.

Given that there's only three actions, there's a surprising amount of game here. There's a fair bit of random, but it's somewhat manageable, and it doesn't feel like it's too much. I had a lot of fun with the game.

Oh... I really like most of the art and aesthetic of the game... except for the cover! The cover, at least the one that most people have and is shown online, is horrible. There's another four different versions, all of which are better than the one they always spotlight, but most places online won't guarantee which cover you get when you put in an order.

About [thing=155987][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=155987][/thing] is a card game. This is important to know, as I saw this game receive some flak due to some people believing that, due to its boxes and components, they would be buying a full fledge board game. [thing=155987][/thing] is a game of hand management more than anything else - you gather cards in order to best use them to get Lords. That is it. The basic mechanic of [thing=155987][/thing] is pretty straightforward.

In the game everyone is trying to be enthroned and rule the Abyss people. To do this, you gather allies (cards) and pearls (the currency in the world of [thing=155987][/thing]) and use them to get the help of Lords to your side. Lords are worth points and most have a special ability, either once per game (when you get it) or a continuous effect, until it is covered. Some Lords also come with a Key symbol - when you get three of these, you take a location, a mandatory action, since the location covers the powers of the Lords associated with the Keys, but the locations are always worth several points.

The goal of the game is to have the most points in the end, which occurs when someone acquire the 7th Lord to her side, triggering the final round. [thing=155987][/thing], while having easy rules, allow for some neat decisions, due to many powers of Lords and the benefits they can give, coupled with the restrictions each has to be taken to your side. [thing=155987][/thing] players rather fast and has little direct interaction, though the military Lords allow its owner to mess somewhat with other players.

Still, while [thing=155987][/thing] is gorgeous and plays well and smooth, it isn't groundbreaking nor it need such a big production value - it could definitely be a $20 game in a medium box, instead of a $50 game in a big one. Since [thing=155987][/thing] falls in that OK level, it didn't serve it well to have such a high price tag, but is sure looks nice in the table. 

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players have three main actions (which they can do only one) and one extra action to do on their turns:
a) Explore: the main player reveals cards, one at a time, from the deck of allies.The other players can buy first the cards revealed - the first one bought costs 1 pearl, the second 2 pearls, and so on. But each player can only buy one. If the player exploring reaches the end of the line, she must get the last revealed card, but also gains a pearl. The player exploring can also simply end the exploration before the final space, after everyone passed on buying a card (or everyone already bought one), by taking the revealed card - she simply won't get the bonus pearl. All unwanted cards in the row go to the appropriated place for their races in the council chamber bellow (each ally card belongs to a race). If a Moray card is revealed, the main player can "fight" it, gaining the current bonus - no other player can fight the Moray. If the main player don't want to fight the Moray, the bonus it gives when defeat will increase;

b) Consulting: the player takes a pile cards from the coucil chamber (the unwanted cards that were left from the exploration). The cards here are divided in races, so the player takes all the cards of a given race;

c) Recruit a Lord: the player pays the cost of a Lord with allies cards. Each Lord has an associated cost and a restriction regarding the number of different races cards that must be used when recruiting it (for instance: a cost of 11 and requiring the use of 3 different races cards). There is no limit to the amount of cards that can be used, but no less or no more than the exact number of races can be used. It is possible to complete the payment of a Lord with pearls, in a 1-to-1 basis. Most of the Lords have special abilities, that will be available to you once you Recruit them. If, when buying a Lord, this one brings a 3rd Key to you, you will immediately gain a Location, which is worth points, but block the powers of the Lords with a Key symbol. After a Lord is recruited, the player keeps the lowest card used to acquire the Lord - it is the Assistant - and this card will be worth points at the game's end. If two or more cards are tied for the lowest, the player chooses which to keep.

The extra action is pay pearls to open new Lords from the deck, as Lords aren't replaced after being recruited until there are only two available - if this happens, the row of Lords will be filled.

The game proceeds with these actions being done until a player reaches 7 recruited Lords. This will trigger the final round. Then, once the game ends, the player with the most points (from lords, locations, assistants and Moray tokens) will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which action to make - explore, recruit or seek consult. Explore and consult are normally easy decisions to make: if a deck in the council is big, it is normally better to take the cards. If you are in need of pearls, exploring is best - and in here, the decision is if/when to stop, or push your luck; and if a Moray shows up, to fight it or not. When not being the main player, the decision, when someone is exploring, is to buy or not a given card - normally also easy to make.

Recruit is the richest decision-making moment: this takes into consideration the cost and restrictions of each of them, value in points, special ability and also if it has or doesn't a Key symbol, as you might not want a 3rd Key, which will make you lose the abilities of two Lords you already have. Coupled with this, is also important to consider how to pay - remember that the lowest card used is turned into an Assistant, is also grants points.

Finally, which location to take when getting to three Keys. The game allows the player to simply take an open location, or to pay pearls and take locations from the pile - the number of pearls is the number of locations taken. The player will keep one of the locations and the others will be open for the other players.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- The art and production value are through the roof;
- Gameplay is smooth, easy to understand and to play;
- Plays rather quickly, since the turns are done fast, so downtime is normally low;
- Allows for some nice combos, but not too powerful or big, due to the location mechanic that covers abilities.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Too costly for what could be a small to medium card game;
- There are plenty of luck present, specially in the exploration and the opening of new Lords;
- Most of the decisions are easy to make.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like playing chess with Aquaman in Atlantis. The setting is there, but you aren't really doing anything sea worthy. [thing=155987][/thing] isn't an abstract game: the types of the Lords are used well: the military attack, the political change alliances, the mages do some unique things, and so on. But, for the rest, is merely names and uses, without no bearing of theme.

The flow of [thing=155987][/thing] is very smooth and it reminds me of a slightly more complex version of [thing=6249][/thing], where you gather cards for later use to take what is worth points, but without the very neat aspect of actually building something. Also on gameplay, though BGG says its better with 4, I can't see what a 4th person would add to the game besides downtime.

The recommendation for [thing=155987][/thing] is rather tricky: it is, as I mentioned, an OK to good game, but one that is too costly for the [i]game[/i], but not for the components you get. The publisher made the stuff inside worth it. However, I can't shake the feel that all of  [thing=155987][/thing] could come inside a [thing=478][/thing] box, just changing the material of the components, crossing off the board and went to the same price range. And if is costed as much as [thing=478][/thing], I would recommend it for everyone. As it is, I only do it for those that want the over the top bling.

Great light game with easy to teach rules, little downtime and lot of replayability since there is a ton of different lords to purchase. It is important to note that monster track must be houseruled! Original rules are very bad because after couple games the track will never go beyond second place. Our houserule for fixing this is a bit complicated but for us it works: When someone draws the monster card he can choose to fight the monster if he wants. If he fights the monster he throws a 1d6 for himself and for the monster. Bigger number wins and player wins ties. If player wins he gets the reward but if he loses -> monster grows bigger and player can choose to either take one pearl or the last ally he drew before monster card as a consolation prize. This way it is not always good to fight the monster and the monster can grow big but at the same time even if you lose you get the consolation prize so losing does not feel TOO bad.

One of my favourite mechanics in games is the conundrum of advancing your own agenda at the cost of helping your opponents along. Abyss is built almost entirely around this, and as you can imagine I enjoy that very much. 

I compare it quite often to Splendor, but Abyss is much harder to introduce to burgeoning-gamers. The explanation takes much longer, and the mechanics can overwhelm initially. But the sweat. Oh, the sweat. 

Almost essential that you have at least 3 players around the table for this to shine. And boy does it shine. Do you want that card? Well everyone else gets to bid first, and if you get greedy and push your luck for a higher value, you are only feeding those ravenous other players on later turns when they pick up all the scraps. And like every good game should; it makes sure you are paying attention on your opponents' turns. Nothing beats grinning wildly as you yank a coveted card away from someone and hand them a grimy pearl in exchange (side-note, the pearl components are awesome). 

Takes around an hour or two with the full complement of players, but trust me, that is the experience you'll want to have.

Abyss is a beautifully designed game with some annoyances. Some cards change the game in ways from which it is difficult to recover. If played early, there is little hope of winning. In this way the balance felt off. I can't get excited about playing this again. Perhaps they will make an expansion to balance and make cards less punishing.

Abyss is a great card game in the same vein as Port Royal (push your luck and set collection), but with a great theme and fantastic components & artwork. Really more of a family game than a gamers' game, but great because of its limited game length, interesting player powers and snappy game turns. Recommended, even with just two players (although better with more).

This one grew on me: a family-style set collection game with an interesting (if slightly cumbersome) push-your-luck mechanic and wonderful artwork.

While an initial play might leave one scratching ones head as to what the big deal is, further play shows plenty of interaction between the three collectible types. 

Figuring out what set of Ally cards to use for buying Lords (as well as whether to use Pearls) gives you interesting choices for building up your Ally scoring. Different Lords might be more or less useful based on their power and how long it might last (whether or not they have keys). And deciding whether or not to dig through the location deck to find one that best suits your current tableau of Lords and Allies potentially puts you at risk of putting out great locations for your opponents.

Add to this the fact that each action has it's own luck-pushing element (Filling the Council with more Allies the more you explore, re-filling the Lord track if you buy one of the last Lords, the above mentioned Location digging) and you have a surprising amount of interaction for a game of this type.

That these additional considerations lend more thoughtfulness to play without over-burdening the players is a rarity in this current era of design. Cathala's games don't always do it for me, but when they do (and usually when tempered by a co-designer, as in this case), they knock it out of the park.

If there's one complaint, it's that the monster track is a throwaway piece of design that's drastically un-compelling given the rest of the game. I hear that the upcoming second expansion will fix it, though, so I'm currently eagerly awaiting it.

Fun little game.  This is the first time I will say "over-produced" in a somewhat accusatory way.  I enjoy how beautiful the game is, but it's a bit silly having this grand board demanding all of this table real-estate, really heavy cardboard slabs that simply sit in front of you, and loads of confusing verbiage and descriptors.  Really just a pretty simple set-collecting card game.  I think it might be to it's detriment somewhat, because the game would be a nice evolutionary step from Ticket to Ride, but going from happy trains to warring underwater lords and tribes is a big theme jump.  It also creates a lot of jargon that creates an unnecessary barrier of entry.

Overall I think the game is fine, if it moves quickly.  There's really not much there for it to be entertaining for more than 30 minutes.  There's very little you can do to interact with other players.  The more I play it the less I seem to like it.

Very nice looking art. A good game also. For some reason this felt familiar and the closest I could compare it to is Ticket to Ride. It's got the same kind of build-up phases of set collection followed by rushing buys of lords/railroads. However, it adds on that familiar engine a huge mix of other elements but still preserves relative simplicity. All in all this is a very good next step when wanting more complexity than TtR but not feeling confident enough for some "real" euros.

[+] components and artwork are top-notch, good board design, a lot of interesting decisions for a fast-paced and relatively short game (~1h), scoring 3 keys at the expense of 3 powers
[-] the art (no matter how great) does not make a theme, takes a lot of table space, point salad does not make a very exciting end, threat track does not add much (I think you could do without)

I bought Abyss primarily for the stunning artwork, and was somewhat cynical after it received so-so reviews after GenCon 2014. However, it's proved among our best games (two-player) of the year. 

It's a super-filler, which plays in 45 minutes, is easy to explain, and has agonising decisions despite simple rules. Most of the interest comes from anticipating and interacting with your opponents, something rare in modern euros. Played between two experienced and competent players, the game is a fascinating battle of wits.

Truly wonderful... I can't recommend this one highly enough to couples who enjoy interactive weeknight games like Guildhall.

Abyss is a simple game. The entire thing revolves around set collection, via a push-your-luck draft of the game's multiple currencies. It is super light and breezy, yet there are quite a few decision points and multiple strategies to pursue, all of which need to be adjusted on the fly according to what your opponents are doing. Think multiplayer Lost Cities, with a dash of Alhambra.

It's not a must have game at 50 bucks, nor will it engage most heavy gamers. But if you see it cheap, give it a whirl. The art and production are absolutely gorgeous, and the set collection is interesting enough to push it past the filler label.

What I Love-
Building your tableau. Competing to recruit the Lord you want. The way the exploring action keeps everyone involved in the game. the pearls. The powers on the Lords you recruit. The locations to get victory points based upon your tableau. Quick game play. Feels like a cross between Ticket to ride, and San Juan.
The other options to subtly score points.(monsters, affiliated allies)

What I Dislike-
Seems to be settling in at an 8 for me, might drop... good but not necessarily great.

Abyss does not shine for originality but it is simple enough and offers some interesting decisions, flows well and, most of all, it has one of the best art ever seen in a game, comparable to my favourite, Blue Moon City.
The best mechanic is the one that forces you to relinquish some of your special powers when you get a kingdom to have more scoring opportunities.

[EDIT]: after second game i appreciate this much more, the dynamics in three players are even better and art is SOOOO gorgeous! on of the best ever! it flows well, it is quite tense and there are interesting choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This rating is after one demo play of the game at Gen Con, so it may change after a full play, however I enjoyed the gameplay and the decisions offered. Abyss is not an incredibly complicated game: you have three choices on your turn: start an offering (auction is the wrong term here), take all of the cards of one color, or buy a sea lord. The offering and cards both result in taking small cards (what I believe are allies). Those small cards let you buy sea lords later, which earn you points and abilities. However, don't get too cozy with those abilities because they can be taken away by red (military) sea lords or once you reach three sea lords with keys they're benefits are covered up.

However, that's it. There aren't too many more decisions to be made, and I think that's the beauty of it. You can teach this one to family and friends and they should be able to grok it while enjoying the absolutely [b]beautiful[/b] art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game. The card drafting mechanic is a fun way to move through the game. It keeps the game moving forward and keeps players involved even when its not their turn. The only complaint I have is that some of the lords have overpowered abilities. This is usually mitigated by the collection of territories, but I have played games where people just never collect that third key. Regardless I still enjoy playing the game.

I had this game on my "To-Get" list for a few years and finally, earlier this year, I picked it up. A more intense set collection game. Easy turns with easy choices and I DO want the expansion. Do you go exploring, which sets off an auction for every card you draw, do you seek aid, where you take a stack of non-chosen cards of one color? Or you can influence a Lord to your cause, which will unlock locations (more points) and give you abilities. I'm not terribly fond of the pearls as currency. I like this game.

RATING: 5
The game looks really good, but the mechanics lead to a bit of unsatisfactory feeling in the end.  This to me revolves around the mixing of two mechanics the locations, and Lord acquisition.  The locations are good scoring opportunities, but you can be left with a set of locations where you score little points.  Now you are left with a decision go for another location and/or make your one scoring location work well for you.  If you choose to concentrate on the latter, and it is Lord based, and there is a full council or near full council you have no way to force the court to be populated with these Lords.  This complaint also relates to getting a bad court, which you have no mechanic to compensate for this situation.  This leads to the game feeling like it has a lack of depth, and feeling more luck based.

Pretty good very light game.  Not one I would play over and over but for times when you aren't sure what to play this will do!

Light card management game with superior artwork but pasted on theme. It's a good game but don't expect anything too deep. There a good amount of variation in lords and locations.

Set collection game with a strong emphasis on assessing value and risk as you explore the depths. Decent game play combined with amazing art and components makes this a very fun time.

Awesome game that revolves entirely around the idea that you can give yourself more options at the cost of providing more to your opponents. Very well done balancing act. I love bring this one out.

Group loves this game and I understand why. Fast, quick, fun. Like a flabby Splendor but with theme.

great cooperative speed game.  I love coop games, I love speed games and this is a gloriously well done combination of the two!  An extremely intense experience.

(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

Our initial game left me a little confused.  Our four-player game was amusing, but we found it incredibly easy to beat, which is very unusual for a co-op game.  I'll have to go over the rules again to make sure we followed the rules correctly.  Reserving rating until that happens.

Update: This has fallen utterly flat with my gaming group.  I don't see it ever getting played again.

This is not my kind of game, but that doesn't mean it's a bad one.  It's got some strangely-timed elements that make it stressful.  But it is cooperative and has dice rolling, so that's cool.  The components are absolutely top-notch.

Great game!  I love how the real-time element mitigates the controlling player element of a lot of co-ops.  I was worried that the time limit would be harsh, but it's not so bad if everyone is clear about their roles.  Can't wait to see what Z-Man does with this game.

I have only played the games through a couple of times now... (we didn't introduce the timer until half way through the second game - I recommend that you don't use the time when playing with a new player - you could also just play 3 rounds instead of 6 to give them a feel for the game.)  My wife loves the artwork and the co-op play... I think it will hit the table more often than most other games in my collection...  oh, and a 2 player game can be bashed out in 30 minutes once you know what you are doing.

I love the timer mechanism and the way it imposes excitement and tension on the game. I also like how this seems to be 2 different cooperative games in one: First you have the speed game of swapping dice and making ingredients that your partners need, and then you have the group decisions between rounds where you have to decide what upgrades you will need to succeed. The downside of the game is that the rules are not intuitive, and the game can get a little repetitive. I wish we were taught by someone who already knew how to play because it felt like the rulebook was a little ambiguous on some points. And the rounds all start to feel the same after awhile, which I also find frustrating. I'd play again, but this is one game that I took off my "must own" list after playing.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Definitely feels different than other Co-ops.  I am usually not a huge fan of timed games, but this one is silly fun.  The character powers do not seemed balanced, and those + dice rolls seem like they could make the game very swingy.  The timer is a piece of crap (would of just rather had sand timers, or at least had the choice), and to think that is the component that caused this game to be delayed.  The game was fun, and there is definitely a place in my collection for this, as it is very different than the other Co-ops I have played. 

One final note: I have nothing good to say about Game Salute after this campaign... I will NEVER purchase anything from them again.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting time pressured co-op, with divided responsibilities, like Space Alert. A few balance tweaks are needed, but the end result is a lot of fun. I like the 6 day structure, where the strategizing happens between each day.

A cute little cooperative where you and your friends are trying to perpare meals and serve customers before the timer runs out.

I think we played slightly wrong - because we had a long period of preparation which made getting things out the door a lot easier.  Shrug.

Not many of these were made, and I'd love to see it go commercial.

I was super excited to pick this game up from Kickstarter, I'd been looking for it for awhile but it was a hard one to get... My copy finally arrived, I finally got to play it and it just sort of fell flat. I'm not sure if we weren't playing close enough to the rules (one person seemed to be directing everything and we weren't real particular on who was doing what...) or if we got the rules wrong. Hopefully I can get this played again, I really want to like it.

The electronic timer is super annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Real-time cooperative game? Quirky, fun theme? This is a recipe for wacky, wild fun, right? 

Wrong. This is one of the most boring co-op games I've ever played. Since players each take separate turns, there is very little cooperation, and the only interesting decisions to make occur once the timer has stopped. Bleh.

I'm not normally a fan of real time games, but this one is very fun.  It's very thematic and feels like you are working frantically in a restaurant kitchen.  It does go on a little long, but it's still worth it.

One small problem: players are so busy moving ingredients around and filling orders that they can sometimes miss when a timer runs out.  For my next play I will be using a timer that beeps when time runs out.

RATING: 7
After waiting 3 years for the game to be reprinted, then another year for Game Salute to make it, I'm glad to finally have a copy.  It's a fun little game.  It's not going to set the gaming world on fire, but with a full complement of four players it is an enjoyable real-time exercise.  I like it.

Once we got past the very poorly written rule book (it was nearly impossible to figure out the game flow of the main part of the game until we saw the flow chart on the last page!), there was a really fun and addictive game here!

The difficulty seems to be set very well.  We played on normal right off the bat and weren't even able to come close on the first couple of plays, but afterwards we had a lot of discussion as to how we could have done better!  To win, you need to come up with a very sound strategy, and spend your dollars wisely, and also get a little luck with your die rolls (rolling very poorly can be an absolute disaster!).

One of those games that definitely has a "let's play that again" feel!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like coops and I like real-time games, so this game should be right up my alley. And while I find it good, it's nothing groundbreaking. I think the reason why I don't love it is that it's generally a bit too easy (even when playing in hard mode with 15 seconds), and because the gameplay seems somewhat repetitive. Granted, I haven't played it extensively, but even after three plays, I cannot say that I am dying to play it again. It works with both 2 and 4 players, the latter count obviously being the most chaotic and therefore also the funniest. I won't go into too many details on how Games Salute handled the delivery and the promised artwork of this game, but let's just say that it wasn't satisfying... Not that it has any influence on my opinion of the gameplay itself, but I urge people who might read this to take a look at how poorly the whole process was handled, it's actually quite funny in a sad way. Anyway, Wok Star is a fine game, but it's not even close to the best coop game, and it's also not the best realtime game, so I cannot justify a higher rating.

Wok Star was a pleasant surprise for me at a convention. I'm not normally a fan of coop games, but if I'm going to play one, I love the idea of a real-time rush game, like Space Alert or Escape. Wok Star fits the same bill.

Unlike those other titles, Wok Star involves a bit of planning as you try to figure out how to make bigger and better dishes demanding extra ingredients. It was all a bit of a blur as I had to learn the game quickly, but I'd play this again, and I'm curious if the kickstarter version is streamlined.

I like timed coops, but think on the whole I prefer escape (and this isn't even close enough to compare to space alert). I also realised in the final round that I knew exactly how many resources we needed which short circuited the manic nature of the game.

This is madcap tension in a cooperative environment.  Players roll their dice and then try to quickly fill orders based on recipes in front of them, and swapping dice among themselves.  Whenever you run out of time, that's a dissatisfied customer giving you bad publicity!

But the real key is deciding between rounds how to upgrade.  Should you add another recipe to the menu?  Advertise for more customers?  How much cash is worth burning to give you these options?

This is really quite fun if you can get a good group to work together.  Well worth owning when a reprint becomes available.

Pledged in Now Boarding KS campaign for 3rd Edition.

Tim Fower’s description of new edition:
“Wok Star was my first boardgame and I’m bringing it back for the fans. This will be a new 3rd edition of the game. Like Now Boarding, Wok Start is a realtime cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players are members of the Wang family, trying to keep their Chinese restaurant in business. Each player has a unique responsibility — ingredients to prepare, and recipes to serve.  And you only have 20 seconds to serve each customer.

I’m mixing the best elements from the first two editions, and adding some new, modern mechanics. I want to keep it’s identity as a game, but tweak a few things to keep it dynamic. There will be more paths to victory via new investments, each with their own risks and rewards. There are more ways to use your dice and deal with bad rolls. And of course it’ll keep the great art and fun sense of humor. 

• Coordinate “Grocery Runs” that allow all players to reroll use their dice again.  
• Go fancy and add new ingredients to your dishes allowing you to make more money.
• Earn “Hustle” which allows you to manipulate dice in a pinch. 

It will come in the same size box as Now Boarding, 6"x9"1.5" It’ll have sandtimers and a timer app. Check out the new tiers that include copies of Wok Star.”

RATING: 8
This game really captures its theme.  You feel as if you and the other players are working together to make this restaurant work!  Hurry and fill the orders!  How shall we invest in this place?  It's fast, fun, and delicious.

It is also hard!  I haven't won on Easy level yet.  And the rules need a bit of cleaning up.  I'm still not certain that I'm really playing right.  The frenetic quality of the game, though, begs for house ruling.

All in all, great game!

I picked this up at the local FLGS because it looked interesting and I was hugely dissappointed to find that it required batteries to play and the components are pretty cheap and nasty really.
This mean that it was [b]unplayable[/b] out of the box.
I am very dissappointed in this purchase as I feel I have been ripped off, the game play better be damn good! 

I have actually enjoyed this. Not particularly frantic as a game but an interesting diversion. I think others in my group enjoyed more than I. The cheap timer included with the game will have to be replaced as it is almost impossible to set and reset the timer with any accuracy, but I can overlook the other shoddy components.

Rules issues seem to allow the game to be played against the intended spirit.  The frantic energy that appears in the first couple rounds is quickly squashed by realizing that one can solve the round before it's played, leaving little fun or crazed energy to be enjoyed. Seems under play-tested.  The game seems determined by an initial dice roll each round, and never develops beyond that.

Losses the fun once you figure it out,and that happens way too quickly.

I didn't really like this one. If things get hectic, people tend to naturally "forget" or ignore the rule about starting the timer immediately after arranging ingredients. And on top of that, people naturally ignore the rules about who should be manipulating what ingredients. As a result, it's hard to accurately hold yourself to any particular difficulty, as in either Pandemic (where time isn't of the essence) or in Space Alert (where the clock isn't at all up to the players).

Gave it away somehow.

It's hard to get motivated to play a co-op a second time when the first time is an easy win. You can figure out in the morning exactly how much you'll need of each ingredient during the day, which takes the tension out of choices about whether to use dice inefficiently. Without those choices, not much to the game.

Now this was fun. It captures some of the excitement of Miss Poutine, in that you are shouting for needed ingredients under time pressure. The co-op kibbutzing is still there between rounds, but during the rounds themselves there is no time for any sock-puppetry as everyone is just grabbing dice.

Co-operative game that's not really that much fun.  It's like a puzzle game, but with randomness (dice!), and a 20-second timer.

Very clever and innovative cooperative game.  It will remind you of cooking mama or burger joint if you've tried those sorts of hand-held games.  However, now the chaos comes not from your own reflexes, but on your need to rely on other partners.  A touch too long, but that should be overlooked given the novelty here.

It's a bit surprising, perhaps, because I don't usually like speed games, and this is a game with timed turns.  But it's a cooperative, which I do tend to like.  It takes some  time to get used to the flow of the game--we didn't really have the hang of it until the second game (which immediately followed the first).  The events are perhaps a bit too swingy--one of them in particular seemed to have the potential for an insta-lose or a no-effect, depending upon when you drew it.

This is the only type of coop game that I will play - one with a speed element which keeps everyone involved and also prevents someone from telling someone else what to do.

NOTE:  Disappointed with Game Salute no doing their due diligence on this one.  First they promise shaped ingredients but after the campaign is finished inform backers this is no longer possible.  Secondly, the artwork on the ingredient disks is poor and the pale colors seeped into the white disk background to make a mess of the disks.  Thankfully, designer Tim Fowers provided stickers to cover up those ugly images.  Game Salute also blamed a long delay on perfecting a timer after announcing the game as print ready during the campaign.  In short, Game Salute lied numerous times during this campaign and the likelihood of supporting another GS kickstarter is slim to none (with the possible exception of Keyflower expansions since I have very little options there and they have yet to mess up straight up distribution partnerships to my knowledge).

I'm blown away by this game for two reasons:

- The theme works. When you're screaming for different ingredients or shouting out the current order it DEFINITELY feels like a short order kitchen.

- Unlike most fully coop games it's vital for each player to fully control the generation of the ingredients in front of them as well as spend ingredients for and collect completed orders efficiently. It's all hands on deck.

This game takes such serious focus to play well I was mentally fatigued as much as most heavy games I play, and I guess that's a certain weight of the game in and of itself.

There are multiple approaches at the start of the game, important and varied decisions on buying mid game, and it all culminates in what you hope will be success in the final round, but initial plays have shown that the best laid plans are not always fruitful. 

What a great game. It's a shame that it's among so many games shelved by the Filosofia buy out.

RATING: 6
This is a cooperative game that is about speed. It doesn't require too much thought, so it is fun for me when played at the right time. It is on par with a light party game. The strategy doesn't change from game to game - there is no variable that changes what would be an optimal buy at the end of each round from game to game. Since you have access to any recipe you want, it makes the most sense to just always buy the recipe with the largest overlap of ingredients you already have. 

After a couple plays, you'd buy the same recipe every single time and that makes for a very bland decision.

(I own the second edition - the first edition has different rules that seem more interesting)

Very entertaining and fast paced cooperative game, Wok Star manages to deliver an intense real-time experience with a thematic fast food restaurant theme. Building up the restaurant by upgrading ingredients and buying new recipes, players decide how to manage their money and ultimately make it or break it.

Very fun game of this type: co-op simultaneous play.  The pressure to play quickly by the timers makes it fun and furious -- I do feel in the 'theme' of working in a fast-hurrying restaurant.  This game strongly appealed to me -- the theme (for a mostly-Euro) was tight, the gameplay went well, and the components were awesome.  Kudos to the self-published components!

RATING: 6
Tried to learn this at a Con and I can't say I got everything totally right.

Wok Star is a co-op game, whereby the players are trying to satisfy the ingredients needed to complete various Customer Cards, who order meals at a Chinese Restaurant. 

The trick is that only so many ingredients are available and the players need to work together to make the most of a set of dice that are rolled at the start of each round. These can be assigned to the Preparation Cards that the team of players have, and by doing so they can increase the number of available ingredients. 

At the end of each round the players will earn points for each customer they were able to serve and they will lose money for each customer that left without eating. Assigning your own dice to your own Preparation Tray can also earn a few extra bucks. I should also note that a 30 second timer adds to the tension of each round. 

Between rounds the players may buy new dishes to add to their restaurant or they can upgrade their preparation tray cards to allow for more ingredients to be gained. 

Fast forward to the final round and the players have their objective in sight. In the final round the players are aiming to earn $60 dollars or more by serving customers (think of this as a bit like the final round of Colosseum) to win. 

The earlier rounds are simply a means to add more dishes to the Customer Deck in order to make the required amount of money at the end of the game. 

I think there could be a pretty good game in here, but I need more plays to truly assess this one.

I'm a sucker for co-ops so I'm pre-disposed to liking. Here, the system to beat is the real-time aspect which reduces the likelihood that you'll be able to allocate dice optimally. A round consists of getting through a deck of "orders", 1 by 1, each on a 20 second timer which fails the order if it runs out. Each card needs ingredients. Your dice allow you to get more ingredients, the number you have being recorded on the board - eg any die will get you 1 egg, a 3 will get you 2 eggs, any combo totalling 7 will get you 3 eggs. Filling an order is done by simply reducing the ingredient totals. If one you need is at 0, you need to get more or zap the order (too many zaps and you lose the game). Due to the timers, you don't have much time to decide what's the best way to allocate dice around so as to get lots of eggs but leave the best dice available to get the other ingredients needed for other upcoming orders. Being able to do this smartly under time pressure will come with experience, but it's some good fun getting up the learning curve. The real decisions for the group come at the end of a round once you've gone through the orders. You'll get money for each order done, and then you need to decide how to spend the money wisely - adding new orders to your deck (which will increase your money for next turn), on upgrading your "get ingredient" cards so that one die for example will get you 2 eggs instead of 1 now, or buy a new type of order which a different ingredient mix, which will also add 2 new orders into the mix. Adding new orders, and the ability to get them done, is the key, as you're aiming to maximise the money you make on the 6th round, that single amount being your score. Everything is building up to that 6th round. The game goes pretty fast, everyone *has* to be engaged and locked in and you have to be up for the real-time aspect to enjoy it. The decisions in the real-time aren't hard, it's just that they're under time pressure. Doing the same deck 6 times, building into it, means you may have had enough / be satisfied when the game completes. But it should see some ongoing play because of its different nature and because there are skills to learn in both the real-time play and how you spend your money. Just not sure how many legs it'll have once that curve's been ridden, but fun until then.

Wok star is a fairly good take on a timed game.  In wok star players are working together as the Wang Family trying to make enough money from their chinese resteraunt to pay the rent on their location at the end of the month. Players frantically try to fulfill as many customer orders as possible until the timer sounds indicating the end of the week. Players are rolling dice to get the necessary ingredients to prepare the customers orders as quickly as possible. Then players can plan for the next weeks menu.

Pros: Fast game, continuous interaction beatuful art and unique and interesting theme.

Cons: stressful game , Timer can be confusing to use. Not evenly spread tension with all players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Solo Player Value = Fair. With only one player the game misses that chaotic felling that comes from the player needing to work together quickly. The game becomes more mathematical. More puzzle like. The timers do not affect the game as much either as the single player controls everything.

Two Player Value = Fair. The extreme difficulty could turn played away.

Three Player Value = Fair. The extreme difficulty could turn played away.


It is important to say first that I have the original Gabob version. Everything I write is based on plays of the Gabab version. Furthermore, from reading further about the game, I am convinced the Gabob version is the one I want. Later versions of Wok Star use different rules and different components that make the game less enjoyable to many players.

Wok Star is an interesting game. The restaurant theme is not often used, but fits this games very well. The real-time cooperative mechanic is not often used, but it fits this game well too. The components are lovely as well. Nice thick card stock with a wooden board and pieces. Everything sounds wonderful.

Then you begin to read the rules. You realize that after reading the rules two times through you still have no idea how the game is actually played. Playing the games based strictly on the rules provided renders the game nearly unplayable. The biggest flaw with the rules is the timing of when you roll your dice. Looking through the rules file section on the Geek will result in finding a few different rules. All of which are different. In the end, I used two different sets of rules and pieced together the rules the best I could. I played with the rules that made sense and kept the game flowing. I am pretty sure I got the rules 95% accurate.

Wok Star is truly cooperative in every way. The players must work together.

Added to the fray are timers that make the game occur in real time. Each round of the game must be completed within the time allowed. This gives the game a frantic and chaotic feeling as the players must rush their decisions and movements.

Without the timers the game is a just a big math equation. But the odd thing is that without the timers the game remains extremely difficult. Even on the Easy setting with no timers the game is very hard and the players have a big uphill battle to victory. It remains difficult, but not having timers pushing you allows you the time the calculate every move to the fullest potential. Even without the timers you very well could reach a point where the game becomes impossible to beat. You simply will not have enough resources to continue. Adding the timers further compounds the difficulty. I suggest not using the timers until your group is familiar with the game.

In the end I have a game that I really want to like. But I am not sure I do, or can. There is not a lot to differentiate this game from other cooperative dice games aside from the addition of the real-time timers. But those timers make an already extremely difficult game even more difficult.


Pros -

Fast, frenetic, simultaneous action, cooperative play. This game is tons of fun! (This rating is based on the original game/rules.)  One of the best coops I hope to own (c'mon kickstarter!)

Also, it is worth noting that one person can NOT shanghai (heh!) this game and take over.

RATING: 8
Crazy fun. Stands out as a coop *and* real-time game. The franticness and strategies (buy ingredients BEFORE someone orders the recipe!) are really thematic. Unlike most real-time and coop games, the break between rounds allows players to strategize (discuss what stuff they need) for the next round. Great game design.

I hope a publisher picks this one up soon! Small print runs mean high costs, and this game should be much less expensive in volume.

***

* Most real-time games are relentless "pure reaction" games, but Wok Star requires the players to take a break between the "real time" rounds and discuss what upgrades and strategy they need. 

* Most coops suffer from a "single leader makes all the decisions" syndrome, but Wok Star's real-time component actually benefits from this. You need to run your restaurant in "real time" as smoothly as possible, and, if a "single leader" helps, the players will win the game.

I think Wok Star is innovative in how it seamlessly marries two different styles of gameplay, although, individually, each style is not unique.

Fun and frantic cooperative game about running a Chinese restaurant. Reminiscent of the Diner Dash video game. It's a lot of stressful fun trying to beat the timer, and plays quickly. Great for families and non-gamers.

A real-time cooperative game about running a Chinese restaurant.  The rulebook completely fails to mention that most of the event cards permanently add a die to your pool, and the phrasing on them is subtle enough that it's easy to miss.  (Most are roll a die to see what effect happens, and it's atypical design that you then permanently add this die to your pool that's used for an entirely different purpose, initially keeping it on the face you just rolled that determined the event.)  Without gaining dice, the game is utterly brutal, as you then don't have enough ingredients to cook most anything.  This could have easily been averted with a line in the rulebook to effect of "Note: Most events also add a die to your pool for the rest of the game.  This is the only way to gain more dice."  The cultural representations are a bit sketchier than I would like, but not outright awful, and it was a coop that my almost-five-year-old was able to fully participate in without having to simplify, so we'll probably give it a go again at some point.  I do like that the older the family members have obviously more powerful abilities, as it nicely models experience.

Best play of BGG.CON 2010 Sat night.  Easily the 100% co-op that has the most tension I've ever played.  In the end, we lost by 1 point not because of lack of smarts or planning, but because of lack of true team-work and poise the like I haven't seen in a board game. Never have won a game yet - kinda makes me sad for the Wang Family.  [mergan]

Usually even the best cooperative games are doomed to receive average ratings from me. I look for competition, not cooperation. But there are exceptions, and Wok Star is one of them. It's exactly the frantic fun you'd expect from a game with its theme, and it's executed well--assuming you enjoy speed games. The restaurant depicted is typical of North American Chinese restaurants, and I was worried about stereotypes when I saw the designer's name. Frankly, there is a card or two that might offend some, but I think they're lighthearted enough to be funny rather than offensive. It's not punching down so much as gently ribbing. I've lived and travelled in Asia and eaten things that most Westerners are (irrationally) averse to. I love the people and the food. Cultural appropriation annoys me; this game doesn't.

RATING: 5
This is a real-time cooperative game where players are managing a fledgling Chinese restaurant.  Much in the same vein as something like Escape or Space Cadets, a timer is flipped and players have the designated amount of time to accomplish a task.  In this case that task is producing ingredients to create dishes to serve customers.

Because dice are rolled at the start of a round and then the same dice are used to serve several customers there isn't as much tension here as in something like Escape or Space Cadets.  After a couple rounds we found several gaps where both timers were still running and we could produce our most in-demand ingredients.

That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, there was still enough tension there to make it interesting.  Which it actually needs to make it interesting because strip away the timers (which we did for our first, practice round) and there's not much there.  It's just assigning dice to the needed cards.

It is also a bit of an optimization puzzle.  In the final round we lost by 1 single dollar when if we had done the math a little better and made enough ingredients to make one additional dish we would have won.  This seems to make for a pretty well-balanced game and I wouldn't mind playing it very occasionally.

I do wonder if some of the jokes are too insensitive though.  I'm not of Asian lineage but those who are might take offense to a card such as "Free Meat" that gives you 2 chicken or pork but depicts a dog and cat on the card...

Something needs to be said about the new edition.  I actually like it less than the old one (which I still wasn't crazy about).  The components are a little nicer but some of the minor rules tweaks ruin the game for me.  For one, in the new version players don't have individual recipes.  Instead the recipes are in a common area and each customer card shows the number of the next player to serve a customer in the corner.  This creates a bigger gap and more downtime between turns which kind of ruins the tension of a real-time game.  Along the same lines, this is not a game better served with an electronic timer compared to the sand ones in the base game.  Pressing a buzzer-style button at the start and end of each round makes the game feel like it is really bogged down and clunky and this is compared to a game that I felt didn't really utilize real-time tension too terribly well to begin with.

Fun and funny real time co-op. Lots of action with some tough choices as far as planning on spending resources. Nice addition to the co-op genre.

The 2 player game does not scale well; greatly improve with the "Tweaks" house rules posted in the variant section by LemonyFresh. We've now always been using this variant; its a nice addition.

RATING: 7
This is a co-op game where the players are running a Chinese restaurant.  Each player is responsible for preparing one or more ingredients for a dish.  The game consists of 4 rounds.  In each round, customers come to the restaurant and you must serve the customer before time runs out.  Each dish uses a number of ingredients.  If you successfully serve the customer in time, you get paid.  If you do not, you get bad publicity and lose money at the end of the round.

After the first 3 rounds, you use the money to upgrade your restaurant.  You can add new dishes and/or improve the preparation of the ingredients.  In the 4th round, you have to make a certain amount of money (depending on the number of players) to win the game.

I got this game because my parents used to run a Chinese restaurant.  I really enjoy the theme and the game has a timer that makes it feel hectic like running a restaurant.

This is a unique, fun, and tense cooperative game with a real time element.  Wok Star gets around the "alpha gamer controlling everything" problem by making certain players responsible for specific things.  Everyone has a special ability as well.  It can get kind of frantic at times, but all in all it is a lot of fun!

The game was taught to me by an idiot who tried to simplify some rules and fought us was we tried to point out what rules we were getting wrong. Playing it, I did not feel any sense of urgency. We flipped a ticket, looked at the recipe, decreased the correct ingredients, and called for a die when any one was low. The game did not seem fun, just tedious. The events just added more luck to the game without adding any meaningful depth. Using them to randomly and unevenly distribute more dice to players just felt like a poorly thought out decision.

RATING: 7.5
Wok Star is a cute, fun real-time cooperative play game. There are not a lot of other games in that category, but they usually make for fun gaming experiences. The theme and art style of the game makes it seem like it may be a family game, but the frantic and hectic pacing may turn off many families. The game's length is perfect, and it never wears out its welcome during the hour or so that it is on the table. Part of the game's initial challenge is to figure out the types of strategies that work best, and once they are found, the game loses some of that exploratory charm. However, the game still remains challenging to win, especially with differing difficulty levels. Replayability may suffer slightly from the discovery of successful strategies, which become paths to follow in later games, but this isn't the type of game that really feels like it should find its way to the table every time. Like Chinese food, it's better when it ends up being the occasional treat of a meal instead of a regular weekly diet. Still, there are enough variables in play that make each game itself challenging and offer just enough replay value that the game doesn't feel "solved" by always employing certain strategies.

This game does take some getting used to. Played 2 three-player games without a timer and even with meticulous timing, we barely lost the first game and got clobbered the
second time around due to really poor dice roll. So it comes down to two things: luck of the roll and also speed of execution. The game is not easy by any means on normal setting. Without the necessary dice rolls, one single round can tank the restaurant. 
I enjoyed the game without timers, but felt the tension just as much. However, I am not sure if I am such a huge fan of real time coop games. As such, my ratings reflect the game play

Frenetic and truly cooperative. The real-time element of the game creates a situation where everyone really must work together and trust each other. Best of all Wok Star is FUN.

I am waiting to see how well it stands up to 2 player and repeated plays (although the difficulty seems to scale well).

The game play is delightful, and fills a 'family co-op' niche that isn't easily scratched, but:

Wok Star is a great cooperative for families. You play the members of the Wang family, who have just taken out a loan to start their own Chinese Restaurant. You have six game turns to drum up enough business in order to pay off your business loan.

Trying to optimize your restaurant is highly addictive and enjoyable. The game has a very good theme, and it is well implemented. I also like that most of my favorite Chinese dishes are represented. The game supports from 1 to 4 players and is good at all counts, but definitely easier with more players. I highly recommend it if you want a fun family game.

The game is played with two 20 second timers to simulate the high stress factor of running a restaurant, but it allows for play without the timers, and is still fun this way. When playing with children, or new players, I would recommend leaving out the timers. One drawback of playing without timers is that it becomes a math puzzle, and you can deduce the best path to victory. That said, I still play this mostly without timers, and still enjoy myself.

I'm a sucker for real time games and games about food... so I'm not surprised I enjoy this so much.  While there were quite a few complaints about the much delayed kickstarter and end quality of some of the components for this game I think it looks great on the table and manages to make me hungry for Chinese food... so that seems like an aesthetic success for a game about food!

The game play is hectic as you try to balance getting your orders done quickly with efficiently preparing your ingredients so you have enough for other coming recipes.  Unfortunately the game is also very easy if you aren't pressed for time and after several plays I found playing with people that don't police themselves well when it comes to the timer and what they can and can't do that the tension disappears.  With the right group this could be a lot of fun, but it wasn't for mine so I traded it away.

This is a fun, fast-paced co-op game! However, it can get a bit easy/predictable if you play with the default set up. We like to randomize our starting 3 recipes so that we get more variety and usually more of a challenge too.

Also, rare for co-op games, this never seems to suffer from having an "alpha gamer" telling everyone what to do. Probably because you only have 15-30 seconds to make each decisions, so there's not enough time for someone like that to "take over".

This is a fresh, brilliant take on collaborative games.  The players don't join forces against a common foe; they work together to make customers happy.  I dig it!  Oh, and it's fast and frenetic, rather than long debates and one bossy person running the show.

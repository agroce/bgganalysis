RATING: 7.1
I love the simplicity of this game. Can be taught in less than three minutes, plays quickly and builds mastery easily enough that people almost always want to play again. Player interaction level is perfect. I don't typically like elimination games but it moves so quickly it's not a problem here. Instant favorite. Recommended by John S.

This game works great for non gamer family members, my six year old, and (for about half a game) my three year old.  There is something very Zen and aesthetic about it which makes the game play absorbing and enjoyable.

This is a fast playing and easy to learn game with sufficient strategy for the "pure" gamer, but enough chance for the casual player.

My wife and I have played the game repeatedly since purchasing it.  I have yet to play it with more than 2 players, but it appears that this game would be an exciting group experience.

Now this is probably the most fun tile-laying game I've played. I'm not saying it's the best one... but it's light, moves quickly and is fun to watch, even if you are out of the running. It is very visually appealing as well. I might pick this one up... and I generally do not like tile-laying games. UPDATE: I traded Metro for this one.

Metro-light with elimination, survival and make your neighbour's life hard.

Great filler as it's quick to play and with a fair amount of thinking.  Lovely art work on the board, box and cards and those pieces are rather like retro-modern art...quite classy.  A shame the company's given up on board games because if this was going to be typical of their products, I was impressed.

RATING: 4.5
+ This is the perfect game to have out while waiting for others to arrive to the party.  You can learn in 2.8 seconds, and play with 2-8 people.
- There's no real depth here, so basically you're just killing time until you can bring a bigger game out.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's only good as a quick game, and there are better ones out there that we've found.
This game got donated to my local high school game club where there are plenty of people who enjoy it.

Pretensions of being far more than it is. Plays OK with 2, but even then easily bogs down into separate solitaire puzzles of trying to survive as long as possible with the tiles you happen to draw. With more that's all it is.

Simple, elegant, but mostly devolves into "who didn't paint themselves in a corner?"

If you try to stay away from the other dragons as long as possible, while trying to keep the most board space open for you (and thus make it more difficult for other players to encroach without putting themselves in danger), then it's mostly a game of attrition

RATING: 5.5
A dull game of laying tiles which draw lines and trying not to link into a wall.  Each player lays a tile down and follows the path of that tile, hoping to not be eliminated by running off the board (or hitting another player).  The choices are very limited, and the replay value is scarce.

Pros
- No reading! Yayyyy!
- Fun traveling on a line with your piece
- Cool pieces and board
- Intuitive to play since it's all lines on the tiles
- Supports up to 8 people really well
- Plays quick
- Some player interaction when you send a friend off the board

Cons
- The theme isn't much, but at least they tried with dragons.

There isn't a whole lot of strategy to the game but it's over quick enough that you don't really notice. The artwork is beautiful and the box small enough to be taken on travels. An additional plus point would be how quick and easy it is to teach and play.

This is a really neat game but it has trouble finding a sweet spot with players.  With fewer players, you'll find you spend the first half of the game just playing keep away and there isn't much happening except maybe setting up with a bit of future pushing strategy in mind.  With too many players, you can often feel helpless once the flood of player eliminations starts.

I’ve only played one – two player game so my thoughts are very limited. It seems like your decisions don’t really matter until the final stages of the game and at that point luck is also rearing its ugly head.

Played it six-player, which made the game too short for my tastes.  I appreciated the simplicity of the game though, and would bet it's a full point or two higher if played three or four-player.  

Once the cards are memorized, though, it might give one of those points back.  I'm not sure this is a game that benefits from cost/benefit analysis.

Tsuro is the best filler game I own. You can play it in 15 minutes. You can teach it in about one minute. You can play with two player or as many as eight. It's simple enough for kids to play, yet engaging for adults. The game board is small, and there is virtually no set up time making it a solid choice for taking to your local cafe or coffee shop.

RATING: 7
Easy to learn, easy to teach (I was quoted 15 minutes, and was taught in all of 3, haha).  It's pretty fun, but I think it'd really be more fun with more than 2 players.  2 players was a pretty good time though, so I'd recommend it =).

And after playing it with 5 players, I was right- the game is a lot better with more players, where it gets to the point much sooner where every move becomes fatal to someone!

Good for what it is. A solid filler that plays fast with up to eight players. Very simple rules and is usually a good laugh.

The decisions you make in this game are a little dull, especially early in the game. You could literally play with your eyes closed for the first half of it. The player who corners himself and is lucky enough to not have someone come to his corner is usually the winner. This game isn't really about winning though and more for having a good time.

Enh.  This game looked interesting to me at first, but after playing it, it's nothing I'm terribly excited to play again.  The gameplay is easy enough, probably a little too easy...the rules, on the other hand, are kind of confusing to follow.  It may be better with more players, but I'm not that interested in finding out.

EDIT: I'll leave up my initial impressions, but now that I've played it with four, I'll up my rating a bit.  As a filler, it's great - short and simple.  As long as you're not expecting a really deep experience, it's fine.

This game reminds me of TRON lightcycles.  If you want to see people play this game more cutthroat, substitute candy pieces for the stones... if you cause the pieces demise... you get to literally eat the competition.  :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting twist on the standard connection game in that the players are trying to make the longest run and thus keep themselves alive.  As a light game, it is odd to see player elimination.  This game handles it quite well, since the play time is so short no one feels left out for long.  A good filler / closer that will surprise many.  Just remember that there is a lot of luck in the tile draws.  Play it super quick for a board game that feels like the light cycles race in TRON (i.e. a game with 4 in under 5 minutes total.)  [GTI: AGCL]

Play a tile beside your piece, move your piece along the relevant path shown on the tile, and any further tiles connected. If your piece would collide with another player's piece, or go off the board, you lose (as do they if there was collision).

Very light game with pretty art. Now that I own it I wish I'd gotten Ta Yu instead.

Very simple abstract/puzzly game where players are essentially building routes to keep their pieces on the board. That being said, the game has a significant luck factor and many of the decisions, especially in the beginning, seem inconsequential. But, it does play quickly and can accommodate a large number of players... so its a solid filler if you don't take it too seriously.

RATING: 9
I'm a big fan of this game!  It's a simple premise:  use tiles to create a path to keep your token on the game board while trying to knock your opponents' tokens off the board.  The game is simple to pick up and gets really tense as the board starts to get a bit more crowded.  Most impressively, the game only takes about 10-20 minutes to play, so you can get multiple games in for a single session.  And, trust me; you'll want to!

My very slight complaint about the game is that the beginning of the game is rather dull, as people make their first moves on the board.  The good news is that, unlike, say, chess or checkers, the opening moves don't take very long, and you're to strategic end-game moves quickly.

UPDATE: I've played this enough now that I feel this deserves a solid 9. I have never had anyone not enjoy this game when I bring it out. I also never have to try to remember the rules even when it hasn't been pulled down for several months.

UPDATE 8/28/13: I am increasing my score for this game.  Since my last set of comments I have played with a lot of different types of gamers.  Until this game, I was only able to get my wife to play Rummikub, but she enjoyed this game.  Even the bad group that managed to make Dixit less fun enjoyed this game.  The rules are so solid and simple, there is just no room to argue.  My latest play of this game was with a very good gamer friend.  He was every bit as giddy about each decision as I was.  The fun in the game comes from pulling off that awesome escape or sending your opponent along a slippery slide to his doom.  We played three games.  The last game we even tried each playing two stones.  As always, setup is extremely quick.  The rules can be explained in the time it takes to deal out the starting tiles.  And the art design is excellent.  You can't beat the simplicity and fun of a quick game of Tsuro.  I am now tempted to buy the sequel.

Old:
Competitively, this game has a lot of chance involved since you are restricted by the luck of the draw.  You don't always draw the pieces you need to make your strategy work.  I found that the most fun is had by letting the strategy work itself out as more paths are laid.  Losing is just as much fun as winning.  In the end, I am always tempted to try to get my opponent to follow a long and complex path to her death.  The setup is very quick.  Games are fast paced.  Sliding the stones along the paths can be very satisfying.  The concept is very easy to understand and pickup from the very start.  This is a game I would always be willing to play for some quick and sometimes hilarious fun.

Interesting Tile-Laying game. The game looks similar to Metro/Iron Horse in that each tile has paths that intertwine. The goal is very different, however. Each player has a marker, and must place their tile so that they can move their marker. After placing the tile, the marker is moved and another tile drawn. This continues until someone is forced to move off of the game board. This player is eliminated, and play continues until there is only one player left. The components are very nice, with beautiful artwork.

Its a quick sorbet that gets quicker with more players. So much depends on the cards you draw and the actions of others. Lovely componants, shame the game doesn't quite justify the polish. I would play again but I wouldn't buy it.

Subsequent plays, its apparent that your game is utterly at the mercy of the tiles drawn. I can see very little room for applied skill. The saving grace is that it that it takes longer to set up than it does to play (almost).

Wouldn't want to play again, mark down to a 5.

Tsuro is an abstract that works well for any number of players from 2-8, REALLY! That alone should make it worth the price. Now, the game is different with more players (nice and tactical with 2 or 3, totally chaotic with 6 or more) but that just adds to the replayability. And, the board, tiles, and player markers are all beautiful. Nice little game...

Metro meets Knots and has a run-in with the rules writer least qualified to describe a marker saying "it's me who gets to draw first when there are new cards" ever!

p: Some games are so pretty you just want them to be great. Some proclaim they can hold up to 8 players, and you just want them to work, vaguely. Some are elimination games but play so quick that no-one minds being the first to drop out. Others have tiles and look like "Metro". This one has it all. Surely this has to be too good to be true?

And I guess it is.

The art is certainly lovely, and at the high end of what I think of as US standards. Everything looks great, but the pieces are plastic and the tiles made from card board. Stone and wood boys, stone and wood... Had this been a German production than you just know someone would have included the wind-chime and possibly a complete Zen-garden as an afterthought. 

And whilst it does supply all bits for 8 players, the best game emerges at the other end of the spectrum, as only in a 3 or 4 player game is there any sense you can influence your destiny.

On the up side, there is only so much time that can pass before 35 tiles have been laid, even with people who compulsary work their way through all the possible ways the tiles can go down before commiting themselves to a move. Yes it is fast.

And to say it "is a bit like Metro" is starting on a line of thought and following it to its logical conclusion. 

Alas, though you can do various things to possibly prolongue your survival on the board, in the end it can be anyone's game. Although it can be tempting to consider the placement of all tiles, only the last ones have obvious cause and effect, but by that time it will probably be too late to dramatically alter the winning order. And the initial ones set up little more than traps and escape routes, without having any idea who they are intended for, or get you to the middle of the board fast. Yes, the trick is to guide yourself to a part of the board where you can lay tiles without being helped or hindered by other players, whilst they eliminate themselves as their open space disappears rapidly before their eyes.

And since that trick is tricky, and fun, this is certainly a decent filler, but on a first glimpse you do hope for so much more. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy playing it and it  certainly won't be the last time. But on the whole it's only an interesting diversion at best.

The most challenging aspect of the game turned out to be lurking in the rules themselves. The wording for the use of the Dragon-Tile is so vague that we, with a combined rules reading "expertise" of several hundred hours, in the end decided to just start playing and see exactly what the tile did when it would crop up. And then it's immediately obvious. It's only purpose is to indicate the player who is the first one to redraw a tile after someone has been eliminated and new cards find their way back onto the exhausted draw pile. A bonus tile to the newbie player who can figure that out from the rules BEFORE playing the game!

KNOTS: An unintended perk is that the components from Tsuro are all you need for "Knots", a very intriguing 2 player connect-the-opposite-sides of-the-board game. Now that is good!

RATING: 6
Mukavahko monen pelaajan peli. Ei vaadi paljoa järkeilyä, enemmänkin vaan kentän hahmottamista. Tuurilla toki sijansa, ja ihan hyvä niin. Huonosti pelaaminen kostautuu, mutta paras mahdollinen pelaaminen ei välttämättä riitä sen pidemmälle. Parasta antia kuitenkin toisten backstäbbäily. Toisen pistämisen pihalle voittaa vain useamman pistäminen pihalle samalla kertaa. Ja jos sen tekee vielä törmäyttämällä, aina parempi. (17.3.2009)

An awesome game that is so extremely short we usually play multiple games in a row.  The components are great quality, and the rules are simple to teach.  The one flaw is the way the rules are written, they greatly confuse the use of the Dragon Tile.  Check the Rules section here on BGG for some clarification.  Aside from that, it's an excellent puzzly type of game that has become an instant classic in our household.  A mix of strategic tile-placement and path-finding make this a fun game for all ages.  And just one game is rarely enough, most players want to try again almost immediately.

I think the one downside is that it can sometimes feel like luck when you win.  Often in the later part of the game players have no choice but to send themselves off the board.  If that would annoy you then I would caution you to stay away.  And, though the game is still fun with 8 players, it becomes even more chaotic.  But, again, the game is so short it's hard to get annoyed by the luck factor.

RATING: 2
Too chaotic.  8 people would be far too many - both 5 and 6 were.  Might make for a better 2-player game.  Someone made an apt comment, "once you get down to the last 5 tiles, the game is entirely luck."

[-]Nice little game.[/-]
I bought it because I thought that it was some sort of traditional/ancient/far east game...It is not...
It plays very quickly (too quickly I might say).

First time with 3 players.It was ok.I am starting to think that this game is for 4 players and up.
The rulebook is very complicated for no reason!!!
Rating goes from 6 to 5

I played a 4 players game and it was more or less the same experience as with 3.

Love that a game this SIMPLE can be played so FAST and can accomodate SO MANY!

This one reminds me a lot of Metro and Street Car. Players lay tiles and move their stone along the path created to remain on the board while also using the same tile-play to shunt others off the board. Games are over pretty quickly (15 minutes or about) and so a chance at a rematch is possible. Production is good-looking and the components durable, if not quite as high as those of, say, Days of Wonder. A very nice intro to euro-style games. Bonus for accomodating eight players.

Boring.  It's more of a fast tile-laying exercise than a game.  Just try to carve out as much open board space as possible for yourself, and hope for good tile draws.  Avoid moving your pawn anywhere near your opponents' pawns because it's easy for them to eliminate you.  Probably best for 2-4 players.  Too random with 6-8 players.  It plays fast, but why bother?

RATING: 5
This is a fun enough filler game, and is a breeze to explain. It handles 2-8 players, and even non-gamers can play. It's pretty, too. But as far as I can tell, it's a game of keep-away (from the other players), and that turns player interaction into a strategy error. So you either interact with other players (and lose), or do your best to play solitaire. Acceptable in a quick game like this, but it does lose points.

Played this as a closer, not my favorite. It's very chill, and it was nice that I won, but as the game goes on your choices evaporate and it feels a bit like "roll a dice, who wins?" I think I prefer more raucous light games and more dense abstract games. More data may be required... but I don't know if I'm going to give this one the chance.

RATING: 5
Not alot of game here. Place a tile if you can find a space to stay on the board. It is a very simple game that would appeal to non-gamers as a gateway game.

Tsuro is very nicely packaged and visually attractive. Esthetically, one of the nicest games games I can think of. The rules of using the dragon tile are very poorly written. They are incomprehensible and require clarificaton.

A fantastic game for larger groups of people and for those who consider 40 minutes to be a long game and 4+ rules to get confusing. I enjoy it, though I can't play more than 2 or 3 times in one sitting without getting bored. 

Without too much depth, it's a good game for socializing and joking around about your dragons. The game itself is extremely high quality. The tiles have a wonderfully glossy feel, and the dragon "stones" are so fun.

Excellent, short, thoughtful game that actually plays well with anything from 2 to 8 players.  Many games claim to do that but few achieve it.  Having said that, it can get a little chaotic and you must understand there is luck involved, which is why I'm not interested in the follow-up Tsuro of the Seas, which only seems to add complexity and randomness to what is already a fun game.

The fewer number of players, the better. More players means that the board changes more drastically between your turns, which decreases the effect of strategic planning -- effectively pushing the game more toward luck than skill. With a 2-player (or even possibly 3-player) game, there's a good amount of skill and planning involved.

RATING: 5
There's nothing wrong with the game, but the two player game comes down to tempo with a fairly early tipping point, despite the random card draw. There is probably a second player advantage. Not having played with more than two, the multi-player game is likely to feel pretty chaotic with players eliminated by opportunity fire until reduced to a two player game of pure tempo. But the graphics and components are quite nice.

I don't really understand the appeal of this game.

I guess I just want some angst in my fillers, and this game has none.

Unless you're playing with someone who really doesn't have a clue what they're doing, the first 3/4 of the game is very underwhelming. Just taking turns placing tiles and moving your piece around the board. It starts to pick up in the last few turns but in my opinion it takes way too long to build up. Don't get me wrong, it's not a long game. It's actually very short. It's just that 3/4 of the game feels absolutely pointless to me.

Tsuro reminds me of Metro, and to me, those games are a bit "meh"; take them or leave them. I think I prefer Tsuro just because you can play with 8 persons and not many games (beside party games) are able to play 8. It's a fast game where you need to make the best of the tiles you get. You need some skills but definitely also some luck... So it's actually quite a good family games (and most of my plays have been with my family as it's so simple), but it simply doesn't hold my interest.

Just received. Theme is more Taoist than Zen.. I wish the game makers had done more research first. It's in all that added detail work that the screwups appear - on the traditional order of the kanji/Chinese characters for the cardinal directions and elements, for instance.. or that they used the European element list instead of the Asian ones.. Huh.. Maybe I expect too much from "wizkids." 

It's a great game, though, and I really hope it scales nicely from 2-8 since that would fill a few gaps in my collection. (Only played 2-3 so far.) I have to say the pawns feel solid, but cheaper than I expected. I thought they'd be more stone-like and have a good weight to them, but it's just a solid hunk of plastic. The tiles have a nice, rigid feel to them.

SO very basic, but an attractive game.  Hand size is small and choices are often very limited.  Plays very fast, and lots of people, which are a plus.  Also plays much better with more people, as your placements will be more likely to effect other players, which is part of the fun.

This game is VERY good for a group of 1 to 7 people wanting to fill in a 20 minute gap between other things.  The instructions are beautifully and HORRIBLY written.  They are nice to look at.  They don't explain the rules.  Get the rules from the reviews at boardgame geek.

They should have called it:  Demolition Derby.  
They should have called the "dragon tile" the "I get the first available tile" marker.

But no.... Your life is instilled with cascading waves of intermittent zen droplets to find your inner path of... of... STUFF.

A pleasant little time-waster, good for family who isn't big into games.

Fantastic production values, but beyond that, not extremely interesting.  Maybe could have some interesting strategies in a two player game, but beyond that, it's just OK.

Actually, I rescind this comment.  There is at least some small amount of strategy to be had with it, and I have to say that, despite being a filler, is still pleasant.  Fast turns keep it from being boring, and the visual appearance, in my opinion, carries it a long way.  That said, I'm still not upping my rating, because I think I made it when I was being too easy on game ratings.

Reminded me of Metro, which I can't stand.

RATING: 6
This rating is based on a single play with only 3 players. Supposedly the game scales to 8...which I think would be too many. But I think this might be very good with 5 or 6 players. 

The artwork on the box, board and tiles is beautiful. I wish the plastic pieces had been either heavier (something like the Samurai pieces) or glass or real stone or SOMETHING. They feel kind of cheap to me. The quality of the tiles was also a bit of a disappointment, particularly with how attractive the art ON the tiles is. All in all, though, Tsuro does a good job of creating an oriental feel to it with the components...just with a bit of a glossy plastic edge.

In terms of gameplay: This is a nice filler. It plays quickly, fluidly and the rules explanation is all of 2 minutes. You may suffer some bad luck, but it plays so quickly that doesn't really matter much. I suspect with more players my rating might bump as much as a point. Or not. I probably wouldn't suggest playing this myself, but would not turn it down if someone else wanted to.

RATING: 2
A very light tile laying game where the object is to keep your piece on the board. You keep a hand of 3 tiles in hand which show twisted paths on them, and on your turn you must play one of them, oriented in any direction, next to your pawn. You then nmove it, and any other affected pawns. When players are forced off the edge of the board they are out of the game.

The rules in this game make for very few interesting decisions and in a larger game the chaos factor becomes very high. In a strange alternate reality I will be convinced to play this again because it is fast, but I doubt it.

Decent filler tile-placement game. Very easy rules.

RATING: 10
Amazing what a clever theme (even one only implied by the artwork) can do to enhance the experience of what otherwise is the epitome of an abstract game (I imagine the idea for this one came to someone absentmindedly watching the old "pipes" screen saver on Windows XP).  The game is infinitely re-playable, with or without deploying any strategy, and can be enjoyed by young and old alike.  Well executed game design.

If Metro is "Under Pressure", this game is "Ice Ice Baby".  I honestly think the designer played Metro and thought "What if the trains moved out of their stations?"

A very elegant and beautiful game where you play tiles and follow paths with your token. Very quick to play. Nice and relaxing. Not a lot of substance but there is enough decision making to make it feel more complex than just being along for the ride. For the beginning of the game your moves don't really matter. It's only towards the end when the board is starting to get crowded that you really have to start to think.

Pretty expensive for what it is.

Tile laying to create paths.  Try to create the longest path for yourself, while attempting to eliminate opponents by sending them on paths that lead to the edge of the board.  The tiles can lead to confusingly circuitous paths that form abstractly attractive patterns.

I feel a bit saturated in the "make a twisty route and deal with others doing the same" games like Metro, Streetcar, etc (and yet another new one--see Aqua Romano below), but I like this because it's stripped down to the essence, plays with up to 8, and is reasonably quick. With no branching and two paths leading in and out of every side of every square, it can be a bit of a strain on the eyes to follow a path without using your finger, but they have nice rock-like pieces to mark where everyone is, so you don't have to follow from their entrance. Great non-card/non-dice/non-dexterity filler.

Simple game of space management. Best tactic seems to be to lay claim to a portion of the board and defend it passive-aggresively. In the end, players need to play opportunistic as they really don't have much control over the board-state individually. Plays very fast.

Played this with 3-5th graders in an after-school board game activity and they ate it up.  Elegant and easy to learn, though the player elimination can be frustrating for some, especially young children.  However, games don't last very long, so it's not much of a problem.  Absolutely zero language dependence, so that's a plus for international/multi-lingual situations.

Played twice, once with 2p once with 3p.  Both games ended in a draw on the last piece.  I like the way the game looks, and it's fun fitting the pieces together.  But I feel like most games could end in a draw, as long as no one makes a big mistake.  That might change with more people.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.

On the plus side, it handles a large group of players, it plays in 10-15 minutes, and the components are outstanding.  On the minus side, I'm not sure there are many meaningful decisions for a player to make in this game.  Fun, but not something I'll make a point of trying to play over and over.

Tsuro is beautiful, easy to teach, quick to play, and handles up to 8 players.

RATING: 7.5
I would have loved to play this again immediately. It's a fun, fast-paced lightweight game.

Very fast and chaotic but having to place a tile that moves your own piece limits the effect that the chaos has on you, making it somewhat managable to look ahead at least a move.

There are definitely mistakes to be made and winning definitely involves both luck and foresight.

I love the simplicity of the rules (apart from tile drawing) and limiting the placement of the tile (making the only choice what tile to place and in what orientation) keeps decision-making fast.

Elimination doesn't become an issue given the short length of the game but rather sparked a desire to replay and do better.

Extremely beautiful gameboard and components.

Surprisingly quiet game for eight people.  Not as big of a "screw you" factor as I would have thought.  Very little control.  You just kinda move your piece around until you get somewhere in the middle where everyone else is, and then you just hope for the best.

Great Gateway: Easy to learn and is visually enticing.

Great Filler: Can be played in as little as ten minutes.

Great Scalability: Handles as few as 2 players just as easily as it handles as many as 8. That's rare.

Great Adaptability: Both gamer and non-gamer alike can enjoy it. 

Should be in everyone's collection.

Update - lowering it to an 8. There are just so many games out there now that I find I keep bringing those out instead if I'm trying to accommodate player counts higher than six.

Abstract games usually work only for two players. In Tsuro's case, the game is best at four players. The concept is simple but the decisions are deeper than it seems, if you want to get out of the mess and block your opponent at the same time, while the production is amazing. The tiles are nice and the pawns are some of the prettiest game components I've ever seen.

Beautiful artwork and components, very easy to play. I found that (with 2P) you are just laying tiles without any player interaction or tension until the last few tiles.

One of my absolute favorite games. Simple, elegant, and beautiful. You can LITERALLY learn this game in about 30 seconds. And the built-in time limit, due to only having 35 tiles, means that the game scales great between 2 to 8 players. I know some people may consider it TOO light or simple, but I love it.

My go-to for a quick, easy, fun game for a group. The accessibility of the rules and the 'everybody gets to play' factor put this high up on my list for playing with non-gamers. Perhaps the most satisfying part of this game is looking back over the board after a game and retracing your path through the stylized tiles.

Why this is not a 10:
-> This game is at its best with 4 or more players. It loses intensity with fewer players.
-> The simple nature of the game is satisfying but doesn't encourage too many repeat plays in one session.

E poi qualche partitina a Tsuro in 4. L'avevo provato solo in due, finora, e devo dire che in 4 e' un'altra cosa. Piu' si e' meglio e'. Davvero carino e veloce. Si spiega in due minuti e poi si ride tanto. Ci ho fatto poche partite, per cui non mi esprimo sulla longevita', comunque ci ha divertito molto e questo e' l'importante.

I'm not a big fan of Asian themed games, so this one is included although the theme is non-existent. 

I know about the game (via reading) and thought it might be too light and easy for me. 

Then Wil Wheaton Tabletop Gaming webpisode came out and this is one of the game played. I still feel unimpressed but I feel the urge to try it.

Came opportunity, I tried it during my recent visit to my FLGS. It was 2 games, one 5 players and the other was 6 players game. It works fun (not by a mile) and splendid as a party game. I don't feel like owning it now, but maybe in future.

In a 2 player game, you're at first laying down tiles uneventfully, with no apparent ramifications. But you're actually laying down paths for you and your opponents to utilise once the board starts to fill up.

Games with more players pass quicker, with space filling up faster the more players there are! Player elimination becomes a greater issue too.

Clever game; brief, fun and pleasing to the eye.

Not bad for a quick, light filler game, Tsuro seem like it would work best with a moderate number of players. With only 2 or 3 players there are no interesting decisions until the very end. I have not played with a large number of players (6-8) but I imagine getting eliminated in the first couple rounds would be a common problem. I would rate this a 4.5 for 2 players, but I bumped it up a point for the terrific artwork, which really does add to the experience. With 4-5 players, I'd probably bump it up another point (to a 6.5).

Tsuro has such an elegant design. It's fast, easy to learn, accommodating of large groups, and offers plenty of strategy. Place a tile and move your game-piece. Try to be the last person standing on the board. Don't run into each other. It's not going to be the game you want to play every night, but it's really good for a few sessions at a time every few weeks. I think I will always enjoy playing it.

Good filler. It's a game to start a game session or just make a little pause between long-time games. It can be played for up to 8 players, a game with duration of 10 minutes. 

You and your friends gonna be putting tiles on the board, each tile has path or routes that always connect with other ones. When you put a tile, your pawn (dragon stone) gonna move to the end of the route that is marked in the tile placed.

Your goal is to keep your pawn (a dragon stone) on the board because the paths that are in the tiles could send the dragon outside the field. 

Tsuro has great components, the pic in the tiles are great and the dragon stone is good. Is easy to learn and to teach.

This is a very fun, albeit short, game where you fly dragons around until they either run off the board, or into each other.  This is a really great game for 2-8 players, it moves quickly and is very unpredictable.  Games of Tsuro last about 10 minutes tops, so this is a game you can either play as a "warm up" to something longer, or just play it over and over in a tournament style.

Though it feels a little like Metro, there's too much luck of the draw for my liking. And it's an elimination game (which I am not particularly fond of). But it works great with kids. Artwork is beautiful but the endgame seems rather inelegant.

Perfect game for lunch time, light, quick and simple.  The rules are just a page or so, and the game plays very quickly (10-15 minutes).  Not the deepest game, but we are really enjoying it here.  Traditional non-gamers are also very willing to play.

RATING: 6
This is a decent tile-laying filler game.  It plays quickly, has a good dose of luck with tile draws, and with just (barely) enough decision making to keep it interesting.  It doesn't hurt that the game is beautiful to look at.  This won't be a game that you'll want to play over and over again, but it works as a light weight filler every now and then.  The game also supports up to 8.

This game is simply too short and pretty to try to rate any lower.  I usually want to play, not only because it's a quick little diversion, but because it's a great filler.  As well, people will usually wander up, and bang all of the sudden you have a few people lined up for the next game.

It's also just fun for me to see what situations I can get my stone in, such as "Lined up right next to a guy", or "Now if you go there I can play a tile to kill you".  I don't necessarily play to win.

UPDATE: Played this one again recently and it's an enjoyable short game playable with a large group.

Light weight, not much of a brain burner. Decent game for a larger group (up to 8) that plays quickly and isn't a party game. You can be eliminated quickly, but you won't be sitting out for long. Looking at the discussion here, it looks like people try to make this game harder than it is.

This is simple and quick to get going, it's a great starter if you're going with a Japan theme. I'm not sure there's any real strategy tho, other than avoid other people.

(edit; I still think this game is mindless, but after playing other horrible games, I appreciate that at least Tsuro is over quickly. It has gone from 1 to 2)

SOLD IT

I understand the need for a light game to play from time to time, but Tsuro is soo light in depth; it floats away from ever needing to own or play it. Basicly you play tiles... see where your piece moves... and hope for the best. I've both won and lost the game, the reaction has always been the same; "eh, what now". The game components are very nice to look at, but unless you want a game which feels like matching Domino ends for the sheer sake of watching a Domino line grow, stay away.

very quick and easy tile placement game, simple to learn, great filler game as the game time is very quick... Much more interesting when you have 3 or more players though. Playing with 2 players we tended to stay clear of each other on the board, which frankly gets boring after a while.

(As of [b]6+[/b] plays) This ridiculously simple high luck, low strategy tile-laying game is a good alternative to party games and works well with non-gamers. Plays fast and scales well from 2 to 8 players, but lacks the depth necessary for repeat plays outside of non-gamer engagement activities.

Tsuro is a delightful design -- very simple, but extremely elegant with a great balance of luck and forward planning; fast enough to play that it never outstays its welcome, and unbelievably quick to set up and teach; it works well with almost any number of players; and as icing on the cake, it's beautiful to look at, and it's funny. In other words, it's pretty much the perfect filler game (and you should own it).

This is the 3rd game I'd bought when I first got into board games about a year ago. It was fun, and different, and got played a lot at the beginning because if you only have a few games, they get played a lot! Once more games started getting introduced, and the complexity level increased, this got played less and less. We still play on occasion, but it IS quite light and we are starting to get into heavier games now. This, however, is a keeper. The theme is lovely, the components are beautiful, it plays up to 8, the rules can be explained in 2 mins, the gameplay is simple and straightforward, and that makes it perfect for small family gatherings or evenings with friends that drop by and don't normally play games. Serves as a really good intro to modern board games.

A really simple yet highly addictive game.  You take turns laying down tiles with paths on them and move your piece along the path.  Eventually the paths will connect onto other players tiles and you really have to start planning ahead for where your path will take you.

Almost anyone can pick up the game and it doesn't take long to really get into the strategy of it.  It plays fast and is fun for just about everyone.

Simple rules, good 15 minute gateway game that can handle larger groups of players, and excellent newbies.  Too simple for gamers, instead play the similar route-building Cable Car.

That confusing dragon tile: "If tiles end up in the deck again (because a player is eliminated), players get to draw a tile, starting with the player holding the dragon tile and going round till either everyone has 3, or the pile runs out again, in which case the first person who doesn't get to draw gets the dragon tile."

While I can only speak from two-player experience, Tsuro is a quick game to play that is very easy to learn.  There is a fair amount strategy but the player isn't inundated with too many choices seen in classic games like chess.  Try to think a few turns into ahead and take note of what your opponent is trying to do.

Tsuro has a wide appeal and can be quite happily played with kids, non-gamers and families alike.

A special note has to be made on the presentation of this game.  Tsuro is the most beautifully presented game I have ever seen and has a timeless, classic feel to it.  The only way it could look any better would be with an over the top production of wood board, wood tiles and carved marble pieces.

Fun connection game with the opportunity to take out your opponent.  Perfect length for a game with player elimination.  I prefer Indigo over this (like a little more complexity). and might be tied with Metro (which may have too much going on and take too long for the style and relative lightness).  Would recommend Tsuro as a gateway.  Doesn't hurt that it's readily available at most Barnes and Noble bookstores.

Nice little abstract that starts off innocently and requiring little thought but quickly turns deadly towards the end, making you think harder. Other players can play tiles which can spring a trap against you, ending your game in a split second. This game is like a baby kitten which you reach down to pet, only to find that it turns into a viper which strikes your hand. Very simple rules, very unassuming little game, but don't let it take you unawares. As the game goes on, you must pay keen attention to what your opponents are doing, lest you be forced down a path to the edge that you did not foresee. Very nice looking components, too.

It's great for 4-8 players, is easy to explain, and I bring it out quite often for the reasons above, BUT I don't find it as stimulating as I prefer. But the added layer of complexity that the follow up "Tsuro of the Seas" adds, removes one of the key advantages to getting the game to the table; 1 sentence rules explanation.

Very simple tile-laying game for up to 8 players. Plays very quickly and is ok for a play every once and again, but it's not particularly engaging or challenging since the "strategy" is rather simplistic: keep out of the way as long as possible. The game actually mostly plays itself.

Recently I was with a group of fellow-students in a lab where no one was really in the mood to work, but we had to stay to log a certain amount of lab hours.
I eventually convinced (forced) enough to play Tsuro with me, and soon enough the others that were "too busy" and completely disinterested had gathered around to watch us play, and were forming their own strategies and making suggestions.
It was so satisfying. B)

RATING: 8.55
While the strategy here is very light, this is a great game not only for introducing non-gamers to the hobby but also as a relaxing game. While there is strategy in positioning yourself near opponents, laying traps for others, and setting up escape hatches for yourself, for the most part this is just a relaxing game that is great as a filler between heavy games or for winding down after work or before bed. I highly recommend it for just about anyone.

Tsuro is a fun, light tile game wrapped in the trappings of asian philosophy.  All the components are very nicely done, with beautiful artwork and an eye for quality.  The play is relatively simple and short, but with enough subtlety to encourage some strategic thinking.  Not a difficult game, but a lot of fun.  Now if someone can just explain the dragon tile to me...

This game reminds me a lot of Metro without the obfuscation of scoring. I'm quite impressed with the 2 player game, and the 8 is decent but don't take it too seriously.

I've played with the German Kosmos edition (without the dragon tile and with the spirally pieces) and the English edition (with the dragon tile and the oval pieces) and I MUCH prefer the German edition. The oval pieces are nice but there are fewer tiles, the board is only single sided, and the rules about the dragon tile are just too confusing.

I would have probably rated this a point higher had I never played Aqua Romana, but since I have, this game suffers in comparison.  It is quick, the components are attractive but it's a very simple pipe-layer without any real distinguishing characteristics.  An ok filler, but with other games in the same time , thought involving frame I don't see this as something I would ever herald or ask to play.  If you want to experience what this genre of games can be (pipe-laying) I strongly would recommend Aqua Romana over this by leaps and bounds.

Excellent game.  Very easy to learn and while late in the game some might succumb to AP, the game goes by so quickly the best course is to just make the best decision you can in fifteen seconds and if you lose, turn around and play it again.  You can easily play it all the way through in five minutes--ten, tops--even with more than four players.

This is a very nicely produced game that is far too random.  Many comments have compared it to Metro which I prefer to Tsuro.  I like having to manage several routes at once in Metro.

This felt like a one-shot, duller Metro, and I already dislike Metro.  No real thought beyond trying to stay away from others and trying to ensure a possible escape path for next turn.  It pretty much plays itself.  At least it's over quickly, but I would rather just wait and read some rules while others play.

The only way this could be a bit interesting is if people secretly bid on what stones they want to win.  But even then...

Straight away I was impressed with the overall art and production of this game.  The artwork is excellent, as is the overall art design.  Thankfully, the game is good as well.  Everyone starts at the edges and work their way along the board doing everything they can to not get run off the board.  There is player elimination as you have to be the last one standing to win.  The game plays quickly regardless of the number of players, which is a huge plus.

The wizkids version suffers from having too few tiles, and the rules relating to the "dragon tile" are obtuse and unclear.

The original German version of the game is a more enjoyable game as there are always more tiles than can be used in a game, thus the issues that ccur in the wizkids version never arise.

That said - a very fun and quick game especially good for those who don't normally play boradgames. Easy to learn and teach and fun to play, especially with 6-8 players.

This game surprised me because I simply can't phantom how it can be so popular. You must place tiles. Placing tiles in this game isn't fun, isn't interesting and requires no strategy all you need is to see if you are going to die when you place the tile or not, which is boring. And you can't plan for the next turn because there's no way of knowing what the other player is going to play, but hell, even if you could, the analysis would be boring as fuck.

I rate this a D because at least it got me to play it several times again just to see if there's any strategy or thought involved.

Tsuro is one of my go-to filler games, with its quick play time and ease of explanation. It's perfect for waiting for a player to show up before a longer campaign game, or in between main features. It also works well with little kids or adults who typically don't like board games, and that accessibility also gives this game points in my book.

After 3 games with 2 players, using the rules in the box, I give Tsuro a rating of 6. I like the simple and fast play. The components are a pleasure to see and handle. But the games were relatively uninteresting until close to the end, when choices became more limited. I can see how this game would be more fun with more players. I want to try some of the variants to see if they can improve the tension and strategy for 2 players. I also saw a solitaire variant that looks promising.

Note to self: adjust the rating after trying variants.

RATING: 6
Simple.
Elegant. 
Something to play while you enjoy a latte at your local coffee house on a snowy day.
Move your token along a path you and other players create by laying down tiles with multiple paths printed on them. The paths on the tiles create interesting patterns, and when you're done, the board looks like a work of art. Or, at least a work of art designed by someone whose primary medium is strings of yarn.
As you lay tiles, your paths eventually connect to another player's token, so they move too, and eventually, one of you will run out of options and run off the board, which is the losing condition. It's not quite chess, and not quite checkers, but something more spiritual.

The game has a peaceful calm about it, and invites you to reset the board and try again not because you're angry that you lost, but because you want to see how well you can construct a new path. 
A great game as a warm up for bigger, more involved games, or a great diversion between set-ups.

11-1-09: My middle school students ABSOLUTELY LOVE this game. Favorite game of every single student that has played it. Playing with them has increased my enjoyment and thus my rating. I wish it came with some extra tiles. Annoying to lose 1-2 tiles and have it no longer playable.

Place a tile, go in its path and avoid being pushed out of the board. Nothing serious here, but a nice filler type of game.

I don't know what to make of Tsuro. When I play it, it often feels like the first 2-3 cards played are throw away actions with little strategy behind them. The strategy doesn't really become front and center until about 12-15 tiles are on the board. And when I pull a new tile, I never get that "YES!" feeling, because you are really only playing one tile at a time. Unless you really need a certain layout, it's hard to know whether you pulled something that can help you or not. On the plus side, my six year old can play the game. He can't win it (yet), but it is accessible for kids of that age.

Have some decent memories of playing this as a kid, and not knowing any other tile layers, found it unique and interesting. Revisiting it almost 10 years later it just doesn't hold up: very chaotic, haphazard player elimination, and almost totally braindead. No reason to use this as a kids/intro game when Carcassanonne takes a minimally longer time to teach and you can scale its difficulty by removing farmers for intro games.

It is beautiful. 

It handles 8 players easily. Gamers and non gamers. 

It requires less than a minute to explain. 

It is fast, 10-15 minutes max for a game. 

It is engaging and satisfying. 

This is a solid "9" from me. :)

Rated down because this isn't hitting the table in more than 2-3 years.

Very few decisions.

Very little fun to be had in just playing to see what happens.

No engagement when it's not your turn (so people forget what color they even are).

Has one rule (the dragon/re-dealing mechanic) that's more complicated than the whole rest of the game.

It truly amazes me that anybody prefers this to the alternative, which is to sit and chat for 5 minutes while other people finish their game.

Somewhat simpler than Tsuro of the Seas, but I rate it higher for two reasons: It's much, much nicer looking (and the scratchy looking design of the pathways in TotS actually give me a bit of a headache) and for lower numbers of players I think the game is actually better without the dragons - in a 2 player game, the dragons often have very little effect other than to make each turn last longer, so not having them makes the game move much faster and become much more enjoyable.

I don't get to play this as often as I might because I don't own it (other than the digital app on my phone). For me Tsuro is a classic abstract game with just the right amount of theme dashed in to make it beautiful and interesting. I'm positive this will one day be added to our collection.

This is a great idea nicely executed. The components are well made and well thought out, rules are very easy to explain, and new players can pick it up in minutes. It lends itself to everything from quick plays to reflective strategies. One of the better entries in the "quick-but-strategic" category.

I'd rate it higher but replayability is limited. After two or three games you definitely want to move on to something else.

Tsuro is an extremely accessible game that combines area enclosure with a bit of "screw you." Each turn, a player will place a tile from his/her hand of three. This tile will be placed directly in front of his/her dragon piece. The dragon must then follow the newly created path as far as possible. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible by not following a path that sends your dragon into another dragon or off the board. 

In practice, you will need to strategize about when to place your tougher pieces (the ones with similar sides and thus less options). You may find it more worthwhile to kill an opponents dragon even if it puts your dragon in a less useful position. It's ideal if you can close a section off for just your dragon to use, because as the board fills up, there is no escape from death. This creates a very nice tension between wanting to stay out of the middle where there are bound to be lots of dragons, but also to stay away from the sides which are death if you run into them.

It scales surprisingly well with 2-8 players, though with more players there is definitely more chaos. You can lose some control by virtue of the fact that 7 tiles will be placed before you get another turn. That said, dragons die very quickly with that many players, so when the smoke clears, the end game is often very exciting. It's a very light game, but it plays quickly and I'm happy to play it as a filler before/after a heavier game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 6
This game takes from 2 to 8 players.  It took about 10-15 minutes for a 2-player game, and about the same for a 5-player game.  In theory, it's more interesting with lots of players, where there is chaos and carnage on each turn, as people try to knock out multiple opponents at once, but in practice, players try to stay away from each other to avoid this sort of problem.  It's more likely that you'll be forced to knock yourself out because you have to advance your track, and the tiles you have in your hand may all lead to the edge (and hence, a loss).

I suspect there may be a way to calculate out a winning strategy in a 2-player game, but I haven't given it much thought.

Tsuro is a great game for quick gaming. It takes 10 minute or so to play, a minute to figure out and can take up to 8 people.

A pretty fun game. My largest problem occurs on the retail side of it: It's always priced at $20-$30. I don't think it is worth that much based on gameplay (unless you plan on playing this thing A LOT). The reason it costs that much is because it looks nice... really nice... beautiful board - although the Japanese theme seems irrelevant to the gameplay and the back story just adds to the price.

All I am saying is for a 15-20 minute game, paying over $1/minute is too much. So if you buy it (like I did... *sigh*), play it often to get your money's worth.

Gorgeous components shroud a simple, yet profound game of path optimization. Players lay tiles with arbitrary paths on them, and attempt to follow one path without falling off the edge of the board. Good design allows up to eight players, and keeps it quick at less than 15 minutes. Fun and interesting filler, but after the novelty wears off, it may be a while before this one shows up at the table again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy game to explain and understand and may be resumed as: "Place a tile in order to just keep on the board". You place a tile in order to move your pawn in the path that is marked on the tile. If you crash with another player or get out of the board, you lose. It is funny when you have multiple choices that may affect other players. It is a better and faster with more people.

It can be a good filler between games, but the board is a big, so if you are playing big board games as Risk or Ticket to Ride, you may have to play Tsuro on another table.

People start losing at the second half of the game. When they use tiles already on the board. So if you lose you are not going to take a long time before the next game.

-----------------

Un juego sencillo de explicar y entender y pudiera resumirse en: "Coloca una ficha para mantenerte dentro del tablero". Tienes que colocar una loseta para mover tu peón por el camino que marca la loseta. Si chocas con otro jugador o te sales del tablero, pierdes. Es divertido cuando se tienen diferentes opciones que pueden afectar a otros jugadores. Lo considero mejor y rápido con varias personas.

Puede ser un buen juego de relleno sin embargo el tablero es algo grande. Así que si están jugando Risk o Ticket to Ride, los cuales usan tableros grandes, es probable que tengan que jugar Tsuro en otra mesa.

Los jugadores comienzan a perder a partir de la segunda mitad del juego. Que es cuando comienzan a utilizar losetas que ya habían sido colocadas en el tablero. Así que si llegas a perder es probable que no esperes mucho tiempo para el siguiente juego

It's a super light filler. I would barely classify this as a gateway game. It's too short and doesn't really teach any useful mechanics besides planning ahead which 99% of people already know they have to do. It's great to have at home when waiting for more people to arrive due to it's quick pace and variable player count. It's beautiful and very relaxing but not something I would suggest buying or suggest playing unless we were waiting for guests to show up.

RATING: 7
First played December 5th, 2007. It takes less than 5 minutes to play and maybe 20 minutes to play for 4 players. There is some good strategy in this and has good luck/strategy balance. You draw a hand of 4 tiles and chose which outer line to start on. Each player places a tile (next to your marker) and moves his marker along the path he creates by placing his tile until you reach the end of the tile. If the end of the tile runs off the board, you are out and turn your tiles into the draw pile. If you run onto another tile follow that until the end. Finally you draw another tile and the next player goes. When the tiles are out, no tiles are left to draw and you wait. First person to wait gets the "waiting" tile. Last person alive, wins. I'd strongly recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it and give it consideration in purchase if it appears to you. It's a great filler game!

It's a simple and fun game.  Games can be as short as 15 minutes.  I won this game the first time I played it so it's not terribly hard to learn.  I think it's a good icebreaker or warmup game.  It also could be an ideal game for people that don't normally play board games or for young children first starting to learn how to play.  There is a danger of overplaying this game to the point of boredom but as long as one doesn't do that, it remains a very nice first course.

I bought on a whim after I saw Tsuro of the Seas being played at Tabletop by Will Wheaton and the crew. It is a cool and simple abstract game with some chance element, easy to teach and you get one game done in 5-6 min. The 2 player game is very slow at the start, so I would definitely recommend 4+ to get the right tension and player interaction. In general, I am always happy to play couple of games, but it does not really scratch my itch when I feel like playing some fun games...

Game is short and quick. Basically tiles are layed down and you following the paths created to their end. It's fun to see how the patterns turn out once they start connecting up. You could think a lot about it each turn I guess but I find it more fun to just enjoy this game as something simple and play the cards as I see them. An okay game but nothing really too special.

The game itself is beautiful and stunning to behold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best filler I own.  Scales better than anything, but this is also one of the simplest games I own.  I like it for what it is though, and there is some strategy involved, just not very much.  This is my favorite warm up game for a night of gaming.

The fact that it plays as well with 2 as it does with 8 is the biggest selling point though.  If you don't need as much range out of a game as I do for number of players, there are probably better fillers out there for you, but I love how flexible this game is.

VERY light, fast and short game of time-laying where your goal is to just survive. Almost NO rules, so good for gateway and an okay light filler to pull out with 2 to 4 players when very short on time, likely best with 3, maybe 4. With 2 there is too much space, too chaotic with more than 4. I might have it rated a point low.

Tsuro isn't a very interesting game to me. It takes a while before anything to happen and when it does happen, it feels very random. Only in the late game does the ability to organize the chaos start to appear - and by then, most players are either eliminated or in a situation that provides a strong advantage or disadvantage.

There are better games that use the mechanic of tiles with criss-crossing paths (Metro immediately jumps to mind).

Very fast, very light, and very fun.  It is an elimination game, but the games are so short that it's no big deal.

With 3 or so players there is some strategy involved: if you carefully chose your tiles you can plan ahead and create escape routes or traps to exploit later.  With more players though it's pretty much impossible to use any strategy at all since the board changes so much before your turn comes up again.   It is cool to knock out multiple players at a time if the oppertunity presents itself in a big game though.

Thank you Wizkids for publishing a game that isn't collectable.

Initial Rating: 2.5 (January 2018)

I finally played Tsuro. I have previously played Tsuro of the Seas and I heavily disliked it. I also dislike Tsuro.

Tsuro is a very easy game to explain. You can do it under 3 minutes.

Tsuro is gorgeous, but that’s its only redeeming factor.

The reason I dislike it is that the game is very obvious, you have to take easy decisions each turn and the luck factor is through the roof.  Luck will decide the winner. Perhaps it can be a better game with only 2 players but I don’t like it.

Bottom line, Tsuro is a gorgeous, but ultimately, pointless game. The decisions needed to play the game are obvious and sheer luck will decide the winner of the game. Not even its short playtime can save it. There is almost no game here.

Tsuro is a nice little filler with almost no rules to learn. I also love the board art. I may even frame it!

RATING: 6
This isn't my type of game, but if you have good spatial skills and enjoy exercising them, give it a try.  Its virtue is that it's very quick, so I can satisfy the Tsuro fans in my group without losing too much good gaming time.

Not too shabby! Initally, I was concerned that it would be too much like Metro, but it's not. I like both and they're different; Metro is more puzzle like and analytical (which I do like a lot), Tsuro is more dynamic and quicker. I'm glad to say that I like both!

This is a great coffee house game. Easy to teach, quick to pick up, looks nice, and has good tactical play. Impressed me more than I thought it would. A nice find.

This is a quick and easy game to teach and play. I quite like the game. I rated it a 6 rather than a 7 because several games in a row caused it to kind of lose its luster. But, playing it sporadically it is quite a fun game. It is also a great game to play when time and space are limited.

RATING: 7
Quick, attractive multiplayer game with simple but neat mechanics. Staying alive as long as is possible is the objective, but as the board fills up it can be harder avoiding forcing yourself out of play than kicking the others out!The rules around recycling cards from knocked-out players are fuzzy (and I'm being charitable here) in the supplied rules, which is a shame as they are critical to game play. I think I've got them now.

I am not usually taken by games with this amount of luck (card) induced chaos, but the speed of play and the clever simplicity bring it back. Unfortunately, the new Kosmos version has substituted wooden pagodas for the lovely 'dragon stones' which added a little extra to the original version.

RATING: 6
I thought I really liked this at first.  Then I discovered that there really wasn't much strategy here.  Oftentimes, there is really one 1 "best" play available, and with more than four players it just feels like a random cluster****.  At least it plays fast, and is good while waiting for others in your game group to show up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I personally enjoy games where I can kill other players. Luckily, this game allows you to do that, but balances it with strategy, as you need to account for your own safety with the same move. 

The greatest thing about this game is the pace. You can get through a game in under 10 minutes, which makes it a great time filler if you're waiting for people to show up or another game to end before moving onto something else. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fast game, and the kids like it. A great game to play while waiting for our pizza order. We've played with 7 players, which is quite a different game than we're used to (4 players). You very quickly get down to only a single tile in-hand, far less control and choice. On our second 7-player game, I made a point of playing my symmetrical tiles first--it helped a lot, but the 2nd-to-last player took us both out with her last tile.

RATING: 6
Almost a party game because it's so simple but more interesting. I played wih 3 but 8 would have to be zany, fast, fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played a couple of times... well, maybe I didn't... the game almost plays itself.  There is almost always an optimal placement for your tile and. if you keep away from your opponents, there is virtually NO player interaction.  The entire game comes down to the final few draws and how they affect everyone else in the game.

By only allowing tiles to be placed next to your own 'path' there is absolutely no long term strategy... the only redeeming feature of the game is its fast play time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very simple and easy to teach, originally there may not seem alot of strategy other than staying on the board but it does grow on you that maneuvering yourself right you can ruthlessly take out your opponents.  Also plays in under 15 mintues.

Great filler game.  If two pawns land on the same card there is a potential for screw you opponent by forcing him off the board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wanted to like this, because I like connection games.  But compared to hex, trax, or wu yu, it seemed more random.  The long paths (each tile has four paths on it) become very complicated and were hard for me to keep track of.  With two there wasn't much interaction, would probably be better with four.
Update: I was wrong, it's interactive with 2. Just doesn't wow me. Knizia stole the mechanism and improved the game with Indigo.

RATING: 6
This game has a subtle Zen-like aesthetic look to it.  I almost feel compelled to light several scented candles before playing... well, almost.   

You need to initially direct your pawn towards the center of the board to give yourself enough time and  latitude for movement throughout the rest of the game.  By end-game, the tile placement gets much more thought provoking as the inter-twining paths become more complex.  Best played with 3 or 4, IMO.  -Traded

Great looking non-gamer game. Easy to get newcomers to play but it's not so easy to get them to play a third time. It's a little bit better than okay but just a little bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Place tiles down to drive your token around the board. Remove any tokens that leave it or crash into another. Winner is the one left standing. It's fast and easy to teach. Strategy comes in planning what's the best move to escape the chance of losing, so not much chance of analysis paralysis... but there's not much more to the game than that.

PLUS: easy to learn, speed of play
BIG MINUS: not much more than simple play

I played Indigo a year or so ago and thought it was pretty good.  It was nice to play its predecessor and I found Tsuro to be the better game.  I like the simplicity of placing a tile and moving and enjoy the strategy of placement.  It's important to lead yourself away from walls and opponents, but sometimes your tiles just won't let you.  A really great game that plays best with more, but still plays well with most player numbers.

En mi opinión es más bien un party game, ya que jugarlo entre 2 ó 3 no tiene mucho sentido, ya que el tablero se queda muy grande.

Partidas muy rápidas que provocan situaciones muy divertidas cuando tiras a alguien a la calle, pero desde luego no es un juego para jugarlo toda una sesión, algunas partidillas para calentar el ambiente si hay por lo menos 5 ó 6 personas.

Por otro lado, si te tiran a ti a las primeras de cambio te quedas "mirando el Palomo", aunque como he dicho, las partidas no son muy largas.

This is a simple, but fun tile laying game. The goal is to build a path and keep your piece on the board the longest. You have three tiles to select from that have two paths.

The game is ALMOST “elegant” in its simplicity, but the lack of control and luck factor cause me to recant this rarely used adjective.  With that being said, it’s a great, great filler.  Being able to play a game in under 20 minutes with 6 people is a very rare feature.  Combine this with the ever so important, “lets play this again” factor and you have a must-buy game here.  Plus, who doesn’t like mazes?  Tracing where your guy goes automatically give this game a bonus in my book.

This is a really great game breaker/opener, it's quick, it's simple and you barely have to explain any of the rules to new players (even those that don't even play board games). Just shove a hand of tiles in their hands and tell them to follow the paths and not crash into anyone or go off the board.
Games are quick, elimination turnaround is very few, so no-one is waiting too long to get into a replay/another game.
Want something to play before a big game, or even something between big games, or even just to wait for other gamers to arrive? This game is perfect.

This is a must own for anyone's game collection.  Tsuro is a simple gateway game that even an avid player can enjoy.  I call it the next step up from checkers except you can play with as many as 7 of your friends, or frienemies.  It is a great strategic game and yet is relaxing at the same time.  Creating the paths and following them just seems to have a calming effect even when another player is trying to run you off the board.  Great game.

Fast and very pretty path-laying game where the objective is to not have another player lay the tile you're about to move into.

Good for beer and pretzels, since it takes almost no thought until the last few turns. The sort of thing you might take along when you're visiting someone in hospital.
A handful of peanuts is an amusing snack. But just as peanuts are no substitute for a good curry, Tsuro is no substitute for a game. But I like it for what it is.

It's difficult rating a game like Tsuro. It makes the rotation often and people enjoy playing it. I wouldn't call it a _good_ game, though - it's difficult to take ownership of a strategy and to feel engrossed in the game because the winner is virtually random.

That being said, imo Tsuro remains is that it is the king in a very, very small kingdom - quick games that are easy to learn, have quick turns without a lot of downtime, and play very quickly. Adding weight to a game like this would weaken its core competencies, and with those things in mind I do think Tsuro is a very good game. 

It's pretty, too.

RATING: 6
Based on only one play (three players).  An interesting game.  I felt the first half was bland as the players were placing tiles leading up to the last half of the game when the players began to come in contact with each other.  I imagine this would be different with more players.  I'm certainly be willing to play this again but was not impressed enough to consider buying it.  I'd have to be in the mood to play this although it plays relatively quickly.

I've watched it played twice, and played it twice. Tsuro is a visual tile-laying game in which you want to be the last dragon standing. It plays quickly and is equally accessible to children and adults. There is a minimal amount of strategy towards the beginning of the game, but eventually you get to a point where you are simply trying to play a tile that won't knock you out of the game. I don't dislike Tsuro, but there isn't enough here to warrant bringing it to the table. It should have been a super-cheap and portable card and token game, but I just don't understand the over-the-top production values for what is essentially a pocket filler.

I was attracted to this game based on its aesthetics; it's a beautiful little game. However, game play is mindless, at least for 2-3 players. I can imagine that the game has a substantially different feel with more than 4 players since it accommodates up to 8. Basically the game isn't interesting unless your path is forced to cross another player's path, which is easy to avoid until the very end when played with 4 or less. With 6 or more, avoiding another player is probably very difficult. It feels more like a party game than an abstract.

One of my absolutely favorite games. Simple, elegant, and absolutely beautiful. You can LITERALLY learn this game in about 30 seconds.

As far as I am concerned, this game is pure luck.  You can talk about "carving out an area" or whatever strategy you think is a winner, but at the end of the day anybody can go anywhere with the correct tile.

Games that are pure luck are fine if they give the illusion of control (see "Love Letter").  However, I don't get that illusion here, I feel that the winner is determined randomly, and I don't enjoy it.

Tsuro is a super simple filler, nothing more, nothing less. Not particularly replayable, but has a nice balance in between conflict and length. Even people who dislike direct conflict and player elimination should not find Tsuro to be much of a hassle, thanks to its short length.

All degree of control players may have is lost if playing more than four, though it becomes tolerable again if players are divided in teams. I also get the feeling it has potential to be a great drinking game, though I'm not fond of those, so can't give you hands on experience.

Overall the game has a great aesthetic while still being perfectly playable.

This is a very chaotic game with elimination, where players can take each other out of play from the very first rounds.  At most, there's a touch of spatial reasoning and pattern recognition to realize when you can save yourself or eliminate a player, since the game board can change drastically from turn to turn.  I'm disinclined to play it in future sessions, even though it's quite short.

A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn. The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.

Quick filler with some interesting things going on. Much different than just about any other game out there. The closest thing to a religious experience you can find in a board game. Walk the path, become zen.

After playing [gameid=124172] I can definitely say that this one is the much better game experience. The new version of the game adds a bunch of unneeded gamey elements to the mechanics of the game, as well as including terrible illustrations of dragons and useless miniatures. Do yourself a favor and stick to this version.

2-8p

Gems to collect Variant (cfr indigo):
To set up the game board, place the central tile(.....), then add five green and one indigo gems to it. Place six "u-turn" tiles on the outer edge of the game board in front of the middle lines, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these u-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to himself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.

On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone "moves" as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the fourth connection.

If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!

When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green and 1 for yellow. The player with the most points wins.

My compliments to Wizkids and my extreme gratitude.  A game publisher that on this occasion did not want to alienate a large part of its market and rather than comissioning box art which targeted a niche market, cutting their profits in a single brushstroke, produced an attractive game with consistent artwork throughout for the general market.  This is a game my girlfriend picked out purely for the artwork and one she asks to play.  This is therefore a game that will get played rather than the classics games that sit on the shelf gathering dust.

The game itself is so light it might float away if you took too long to place the tiles but it is quick and can be easily explained.  Tile placement with a clear single objective, do not stray off the board, make it a game which is fun if not challenging to play at family gatherings and to introduce to non-gamers.  The more players the better.  Tsuro is not the final word in boardgames, nor was it ever meant to be, but it is an interesting opening sentence and will encourage more to read on.

RATING: 7
Very elegant-looking route-building abstract. The artwork and playing pieces are very nice. In the end, though, I think I prefer the app version of the game with the alternative scoring methods

RATING: 9
From Wil's Tabletop to yours, you won't be disappointed. It's not the deepest game but it is quite entertaining.

The setup is very easy, explanation is easier, though we did have to point out the grid to a couple of first time players. The pieces are very nice and sturdy.

Definitely worth the money for the number of plays it gets.

A very simple to teach abstract with some hand management, this game does unusually for an abstract luck in the tile draw and is pretty shallow for a game in its family, but there is still a fair deal of spatial aspect involved. A lot of times barring a well planned winding to another portion of the board the player who wins is often the one that is given the most space by the other players, but for a 15 minute game there isn't much else competing in the somewhat thinky yet plays 6 players well niche.

I know they're slightly different games, but they scratch the same itch: maze-based games. There's a lot of randomness, so my goal is always to take as many people down with me as possible.

I played the full size version at Origins a few years back and headbutted one of my friends when I navigated us into a collision. It was awesome.

We enjoy this game, although with just the 3 of us, the first half of the game can kind of feel like you are playing solo. I like that it can accommodate up to 8 players as when the family gets together we like to play games with all of us.  Simple enough that younger kids can learn it fairly quickly.

You place a tile which causes your stone to move.  If you place a tile that goes off the board you lose.  If you collide with another player you both lose.

It is a fun puzzle game.  However it seems to end more often than not with two players tied.  This seems a bit unsatisfying.  

It is a good game to play as a filler.

Great labyrinth game, fast, and perfectly designed.
You can learn to play it in about half a minute, but the game itself quickly becomes quite challenging.
The objective is to be the last player standing on the board, and it becomes increasingly difficult while the game progresses and the board is filled with knotted patterns.
Very recommended for a fast and fun game experience.

Simple yet elegant. A game where you can't use words like 'dead', 'killed', 'lost', 'won'...its far too spiritual than that. Play until your time is up. No tears from the kids, no tantrum from the adults. Always up for a few games as it takes very little time and is such a pleasure to play. Tactics are hard to understand until the very end of the game, until then, its nice to skate along the lines on your own.

A fine filler game. Tiles are of good quality.  Can play up to 8 players (which is rare). Gameplay is luck driven. Only at the very end is there player interaction. Games move quickly so player elimination is a non factor.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple games need to be accessible, even though the reverse need not be true. Coupling a fairly harmless route-building exercise with an overcomplicated gimmick and overwrought rules ruins any potential that this might have had as a pleasant filler that is beautiful to look at. I note that it was Wizkids only foray into games of a more serene nature; it was probably a wise move to stick to their guns.

Pretty brainless--you only have three tiles to play on any turn, and there are only so many ways to play them, so there's no strategizing.  Just make your best play, draw a new tile, and in a turn or two you'll be knocked off the board anyway--this game plays really fast.  Doesn't feel like there's any chance of someone being 'really good at' this game, it's just what tiles you draw.

(10/17) 5. A fine gateway game.  I think I slightly prefer Tsuro of the Seas, but the simplicity and mitigation of randomness in this one does have its own appealing qualities.

RATING: 6
There's not a lot here, but it fills the important role of a true filler BOARD game. I mean, a game with a real board, real spatial relationships, not just cards, and it plays to completion in 15 minutes. That might make it a keeper right there, but the fact that it goes over well with my kid just adds to the appeal. As does the wide range of players.

I bought Tsuro for what it is and for what it isn't -- notably, it's not a party, word, or social/bluffing game, the usual suspects for 8 players. And it's fun, simple, easy to explain and play, and satisfying for its length.

It really does play just as quickly with the full complement of players, too. My first game with 3 and my third game with 8 took about the same amount of time. It's ideal as a warm-up. Nice bits, too.

As a board game by itself it is kind of average, but when you introduce the game is live action with three foot square tiles, it becomes awesome. So 8.0 for the excitement of the live action version.

3 player game. I am going to wait to rate this game for when I get to play with more players. The game is beautiful and it seems like a fun filler. However, with 3 it is slightly boring. There is no player interaction and no way to zoom opponents of the board (since the pieces are too spread out). Edit: Played a 6 person game - very fun fast filler. Not worth playing with only a few people.

This is a staple for a quick 1-10 minute game (20 if you play slow) at our game club.

We did play 3 games in just under 15 minutes one, the last one took about two minutes. 

It is quick, fast and light. It does have some basic strategy though and it is more about who clashes with who than pure random luck of the draw, even if luck of course is a big factor. Seeing those through-ways that allow you to move away from a shrinking play area (preferably 1-2 turns in advance)  into a clear area across the board is the key to victory.

RATING: 7
An incredibly simple game in which players place a square tile on a large grid map.  Each player has a dragon token that starts at any one of several positions on the edge of the map.  Each tile place has a number of lines drawn from each of eight positions around the tile (two per side), with each line beginning at one position and ending at another.  

Once the tile is placed, any dragon tokens bordering that tile are slid along the line.  The goal is to keep your dragon token from sliding off the edge of the grid map or colliding with another player's token.  The game is incredibly simple takes only a couple minutes to play, and it's easy enough to teach virtually anyone how to play.

Like many other reviewers here, reminded me of Metro. But much, simpler, lighter, shorter, and more fun to play. Some confusion involved with the Dragon tile rules. Also, the board's grid lines are way too faint, making it a bit difficult to place the tiles early in the game. I guess they didn't want to mess up the board's artwork.

lay tiles with connections on them and try not to go off the side of the board or run into anyone else.  Neat ideas and some nice tactical play which plays fairly quickly.  With 2 plays with 3 players I think it might be better with 1 more.  Any more than that and it probably becomes to chaotic to really plan much at all.

Very pretty box and board/tiles.

I kind of wish I had little miniature dragons instead of the funky tombstone pieces.

The rules for tiles is somewhat funky... I think it would have been a bit cleaner to include a few more tiles instead.

I love the flow of the game.  It reminds me of elements of Blokus (claiming space) and Metro (similar crazy routes exist).  And imo that is a good thing.

03/13/12 Played a three-player game. I found Tsuro mildly interesting. But I suspect it might play better with more than three people. I'm guessing you ought to have at least five. Otherwise its too easy to merely avoid the other players' machinations. I gave it a provisional rating. We'll see if that goes up if/when I play it again with more people. 
03/05/13 Played two five-player games. Having more people helped slightly, but not as muhc as I'd hoped. It was still easy to avoid the other's until the last round. So I see no reason to change my rating. Though who knows, maybe with 6-8 players it will have more merit. Though I doubt I'll ever find out. At least it only lasts 10-15 minutes. I like abstract games, but this one seems to be 75% luck of the tile draw.

A fine game that gets better with the more people you add to it. It's a great gateway game for new players or a great opening game while waiting for your playgroup to get together for something deeper. The game is also a great way to appeal to more visual/pattern based players, as it relies highly on planning ahead based on both your hand and the board state without needing to know a bunch of rules or strategies.

The art style and pieces are nicely crafted and sturdy and setup and breakdown is very quick and easy.

This is a simple, quick game for up to 8 players. Lay a tile from your hand and move your piece to the end of the path. Try to complete the paths of others so that they collide or spin off the board.

People at my club like it a lot, which surprises me as it's so random. The component quality is nice and I'll always play it as it's so quick but, really, it's a light game that holds little interest. Fine, but blah. Let someone else buy it.

Game in a Nutshell: Lay a tile in front of your stone, move your stone along the path, keep your stone on the playing area while attempting to eliminate other players by putting them on a path that would send them off the board.

Played as: 3,4,5,7 player

Pros:  Beautiful, both in simplicity and presentation.  Maybe the only game I can think of where I would be comfortable framing any component and displaying it on the wall.  Accessible to people of all ages. Easy to get people to the table as there's really only two rules to sell... place a tile; follow your line. Nice tension when paths begin to intersect and a single tile will effect multiple player's stones. The game is fast no matter if playing with the minimum or maximum number of players.

Cons:  I’ve had a slight warping issue with the tiles (WizKids ed.). It seems despite the simplest of rules, they somehow continue to botch it in the rule book. Some people may have a hard time seeing how things will play out without placing the tile, rotating the tile, trying another tile, rotating that tile, etc. Can be a chaotic feeling game, moreso with more players.

Other:  While I’m usual willing to play, I seldom feel like more than a single play in a row due to a lack of depth. On the contrary, due to its quick play, most people can't wait to go again.

Best Use: The Swiss-army knife of fillers... one game will cover you for 2-8 players.

There are some interesting tactical decisions to be made in this game, although player interaction is sparse (and generally avoided).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great filler for 5-8 players, although I wouln't play with less than 5. I like the combination of tile-laying, trying to "save" your meeple while scheming to move other players off the map. Game requires luck and some skills; a small feeling of 'not enough control' keeps me from giving this a higher score. However at 15 mins/game, this is one that I'd be happy to play almost any time.

I really like this game for parties or for casual play. It's fast, easy to teach, and yet there's a lot of fun and a lot of meaningful choice to be made. It's a great way to pass the time or as fillers between more complex games. It's always a hit when I bring it out in a new group. Veterans may prefer more meat, but even hardcore gamers need something to unwind.

Very similar to Metro, with less emphasis on collecting points and more emphasis on staying alive.  Good points: plays well up to 8 players.  Negative points: sporadic replayability over time... more novelty than challenge, so it would not hit the table night after night.

Pretty neat abstract that gets major points for playing from 2 to 8. Limited options, but about as an enjoyable as a "pick one tile, then play it" game could be.

Rating could go up, but from one play I don't see as much potential for screwage as advertised, given that you have to place a new tile adjacent to your own guy. Still preferable to Carcassonne, because it's so quick.

Fun, simple, fast.  Good mass appeal.

Not sure how much of the strategy I get, but I'm usually one of the last eliminated.  I normally get disappointed by bad luck in luck games, but in this game whatever luck there is does not disappoint.  

Could consider as a stepping stone to RoboRally.  If you wanted to get someone into RoboRally who was turned off by the theme.  Of course they'd have to like talking about this game and you could bring up chaos similarities with RoboRally, but that it's even more intense.

Pretty much exactly what I expected. I suppose it's okay for a non-gamer filler, but I have enough of those. Perhaps the advanced versions offer something compelling, but as it is I don't need to own this and will never request it. I'll play if requested and I just want to converse with the company.

RATING: 5
I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this little gem of a game. It's definitely light, definitely a filler, but it plays super fast, and just feels quirky and original.

In terms of the strategic quality - I watched two games, played two, and watched another. In each of the games the last player in the turn order either won, or tied for first with the player preceding him. I can't figure out if this was just coincidence or a flaw in the game state (perhaps a disadvantage to going first?)

I am curious how the game would work with only two players, in that one of the pleasures in games with five players was that there was tons more conflict and screwage going on, and in a game with only two pieces, it seems like there is a high probability for a tie--players can just avoid each other and build track until they both run out. HOWEVER, one of the kids I was playing with suggested that in a two player game players could each control and place tiles for more than one piece--say three pieces each, which would add an entire tactical layer to the game (with the idea that a clever player could focus on a primary piece to be his "winner" and use his secondary pieces to defend that piece, or attack his opponent's pieces.)

---------

Repeated plays of this and it loses its luster. It's fast, and there is some strategy, but it feels canned at some point. Still concerned that the last player has an advantage - getting to see how everyone else plays before choosing and placing a tile means the last player will always make a choice that is more carefully informed than the other players. I have yet to see a game where the last player did not win.

I am awful at this game! I think I have won a single game in the last 20, but I will happily shuffle up and play another 20 right now. Getting friends together for this game is always a pleasure. It has great table presence, when people come by and see us playing they will always stop and ask, "What game is that?" Gameplay is simple and fast but a great tactical tile layer game. Yes, it is probably a filler game but sometimes it is more fun to play an evening of fillers than slog through that 4 hour beast that will eat your whole evening! 9/10 Get it, seriously just order it now!

RATING: 5
There must be a good player number that balances this game, but I haven't found it.  Playing with 2-3 players results in a lot of early solitaire activity that is rather random.  Not knowing what later tiles you will pick up in the game your earlier plays don't come with much strategy, though you at least can attempt certain tactics.  With 6 or more players you have so few moves that in many cases you are not planning and just reacting to other people's tiles, if you have the opportunity to react at all.  

Components are nice, game requires little time and mental investment, and concept is very easy to pick up so makes for a good family game, children game, or game for non-gamers.  Owning Tsuro, I find it rarely makes it to the table, with other games in the same bracket, like King of Tokyo and Escape, taking preference because those are also easy to learn and quick to play, but, unlike Tsuro, are extremely fun, very interactive, and much more deep 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not what I was expecting from the box- this game is gleefully over-produced!

Is actually a very simple tile laying game in which players try to make paths that force their opponents off the board whilst keeping themselves on.

Tsuro is great for when the non-gamers are round and can easily be played whilst drunk making it a good light weight game, but without BGG I don't think anyone would be able to work out what the Dragon Tile is for!

Doesn't last long, minimal brainpower needed, better than Carcassonne as a tile-laying filler, but basically a non-game. Pretty. Strategy seems to consist entirely in trying to stay as far away from your opponents as possible and waiting for them to run out of viable moves before you do.

RATING: 7
A great small game with stellar components that offers something different, but can be played by anyone. It offers interesting decisions with immediate consequence, but these choices move quickly. However, I never think about Tsuro, or have a particular pull to play it. It just comes off the shelf when the situation implies it, with that situation being quite often for me. Good, but not deep enough to be great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tsuro is one of those simple-to-play games that I either use as an intro game to newer players in order to teach them that there's more out there than Milton Bradly, or as a quick warm-up game when i'm with my hard-core gaming friends and getting ready for a good 6-10 hours of games. Is it the most complex or intriguing game? Certainly not, but I'm still extremely glad it exists and is in my collection. As an aside, I actually did discover an actual strategy to the game that gives me a huge leg up over non-players, so contrary to my initial reaction, there is a skill to the game, it's not just luck.

I was introduced to Tsuro by a couple of friends and was immediately absorbed by the simple and elegant gameplay. Play a tile, follow the path to the end and make sure that it doesn't lead out from the game board. That's really everything you need to know!

Tactically, your choices are limited to three tiles on hand to choose from every turn and this is quite enough to create a fast game. Nevertheless, you still have interesting options to choose from. Should you try to hide in a corner? Should you block other players' access to "your" tiles? Should you attack in the center to throw out an opponent? Each new game will bring a new answer!

Lovely game. Plays quick and easy with enough thrills to make it enjoyable. Great warm up, filler or play-while-watching-tv game.

[size=7][i]NB. Dragon tile is given to the person who is unable to draw cards from the pile because it is finished. They will then be the first to pick tiles when they are available and the tile will be passed on to the next person, in order, who is unable to pick tiles.[/i][/size]

Ingenious game that is great with 4-6 people.   Can play up to eight but it can be quite chaotic, but fun.  Simple 10 minute game with an ingenious idea of just trying to stay alive with Metro-like tiles on a small board.  Excellent quality board and pieces and tile quality.  One of our favorite fillers right now.

A game of building a path and trying to stay on it the longest!  Great game at all player counts, though the mid-range count (4 to 5) seems ideal.

Works great as a solo puzzle too, trying to see if you can fill the entire board with tiles without falling off!

I bought this game with high expectations, after a few recommendations. It's not really a bad game, but I feel that it lacks complexity - and therefore fail to engage me. The good things is that the game is beautiful to look at, it's quick and easy to learn (if that's something you look for i a game). I guess it would work well to play Tsuro with kids or grandparents - or with other people that are really unfamiliar with boardgames.

Tsuro is a nice SUPER SHORT filler/intro/coffee table game. There's not actually a lot to it but it feels sleek and polished as you play and has a nice feel.

For as simple as a game that this is, I really do find it fun and refreshing.  A usual game only takes around 10 minutes or so.  They are pretty fast.  Long games take 20 minutes.

The squiggle game!

Tsuro is a decent filler. Very simple rules make the game accessible to almost anyone. As a player elimination game, I think Tsuro may be too quiet for eliminated players to find entertaining to watch while others finish.

The price point Tsuro commands is a joke. A few pawns, a board, and tiles illustrated with squiggles: $40+! Granted, all the components are great quality, but the price is too high.

----------------Preliminary thoughts----------------

Very light and original game whose main strenght is that it plays really fast.

You really can't do a lot to improve your chances of winning. You just head towards open spaces and pray that you'll have the tile you need when it counts.

The first stages are boring, but needed to create the necessary tension of the end. It's not a huge drawback, because it plays fast and your next turn will be just a minute away.

Precisely because of this, I do not recommend more tan 4 players. Too much time bewteen turns and you would not place enough tiles.

I would play it from time to time, but it doesn't have enough to be played regularly.

The edition is very nice, but also very pricey for what it is (a few tiles and some pawns).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love it!  The game itself is gorgeous with great components.  It's teachable in under one minute and plays in under 10.  The fact that it comfortably fields 2 to 8 players just makes it that much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Works as a filler with 4 or 5 players. About 10-15 minutes per game. Game is very light but there are a few real decisions to be made but eventually cards other players have played affect at least as much as your own. Might be a bit more meatier gaming experience with 2-3 players. With 5 you really can't plan too much ahead most of the time and luck decides winner in most games. Game looked really nice and all components (including rules) were very good looking. A bit overproduced really.

As Shafi said, it seems to be a "turtle's game". However, I've only played with 3 players. With more players, I'm sure it's more chaotic.

UPDATE: This is a great game to pull out after playing a long game or brain-burner. Just turn off your brain for 5 minutes and play 1 or 2 games. Also, it's more fun with more people. Definitely at least a direct linear proportion, but might even be greater than that.

It's still (too) simple to play often.

Relatively easy to learn and explain. I'm always amazed at the process by which he designer must have figured out all the potential paths on which to move stones, and how the game gets resolved within the limits of the number of tiles played. Plays quickly; beautiful board and bits. Very fun, quick family strategy game, or good for larger groups, too, as it accommodates up to 8 players. Requires the ability to look moves ahead, as once players' tiles begin to go side to side, people start exiting the sides of the boards and are out. Each tile is unique, but each tile also connects its paths at some point. Very clever. I played with my then 7- and 13-year-olds and they wanted a second game immediately. So, this is a winner in my book. Have also played alone with my 13-year-old, who really likes it (March 2007), and him, my 7-year-old, and my wife, who also seems to like it. The more players, the more cutthroat it becomes. To me it's a perfect warm-up game, and in my experience a good gateway game. If it has a limitation it's that with more players it's over quicker, and even with 2 players it's in no way a main event type of game. But it's been popular with everyone I've played with, from ages 8-55. My youngest son, Trevor (now 10 in 2009) rates the game a "7".

Simple to learn, teach and play. Can be played anywhere from 2 to 8 players...and I really am interested to see what 8 players is like.  The game is probably very short with that many players...needs more plays. You simply play a tile and set your piece on one of the lines. Your piece must always follow the line to its completion. If you reach the edge of the board you are out of the game.

This game fills the niche of opener for 5-8 people for 10 minutes while you're waiting for others to arrive and for that it's successful.

20+ Plays - Great game that can be shared with anyone whether they speak the same language as you, are young, old, play board games or don't. Great with any number, though 5-6 is best. With 7-8 it's hard to fit around the board, and you will likely be dead after placing only 2-3 tiles. With 2-3, though, there's just less chaos.

at first I was like what the heck is this? Then towards the end of the game I was like ohhhhhh! interesting. It's extremily light weight, but it's clever. Then I played it with more than just my girlfriend and was impressed. Now I hope to get a full 8 people to see what sorts of maddness will happen.

A simple game of tile placement. Start at one end and place a tile to move your piece along the path on the tile. All you have to do is make sure you do not hit one of the end points on the board, but tiles placed by others may cause you to continue moving after passing through your tile. Fun and simple, best with a lot of players.

RATING: 6
My rating on Tsuro is based on the two very different experiences you can have with the game.  With more than 3 players, it's effectively random, but fast and surprisingly "fun" in the "yell at the board" sense, which I'd give a 5; with 2 or 3 players, it's surprisingly strategic, and a game I'd give a 7.  It's almost never going to be a go-to game for that player count, though, instead appearing more frequently in large groups where you're often hunting for something to play that isn't a traditional party game.  Still, I think it's worth splitting the difference.

I really really enjoy this game.  I know a portion of it is in the tiles you draw, but I find myself pretty good at it.  The problem is no one else in my gaming group is very excited about it.  I was surprised by that, because I have known these guys for years and was CERTAIN they would like this game.  They were just "meh".  My nephew and dad liked it, but I don't game with them as often as my regular group, so I may think about trading this game away.  It saddens me that it mostly gathers dust.

If there is a game in the collection that could be tagged as "overproduced," it would be Tsuro. It certainly looks and feels great, but it seems to be less of a game than virtually every other entry in my collection. Perhaps some depth will emerge after a few more plays. The kids will readily play it, and it's quick.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast and confusing. It's both frustrating and fun to try to connect the routes in my mind. This would be bad quality in a longer game but this was great. 10min/game isn't bad. Rules are also quick to explain.

The only bothering thing is the last card of the deck. It makes sense of course why it's included, but It still felt weird.

Edit: More plays really made me like this game a lot more than before. It is a quick game so you can more easily try many times before judging.

At first glance it seems like a game that's too simple to be good or even fun. After having played a round I was hooked. Great fun with some interesting (quick) choices all the time.

Best of all; everything in this game is SO beautiful - not only the bits and pieces and box - the rulebook still blows me away.

Very simple abstract tile laying game -- you basically move your stone along a path. The first one to hit a wall loses. I bumped it up one for the beautiful presentation in the box and components, which set a nice theme for this easy little game.

Super fast, super simple, pipe game-like, filler game.  Pretty even though board is essentially monochromatic.  Build a path.  Dragon flies on path.  Don't lead path off board or into another dragon.  Survive the longest.  Games last less than ten minutes.  Good stuff.

I got to play this game at my local meetup as a opener game and it was alright. Everyone catches on easily and were not eliminated early. The play is pretty balanced until the end and I won. As I suspect this game is too light for my taste and it is pretty much a luck-fest. Take it or leave it? I will leave it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light but good throughout the full range of players. A quick filler for 8 players can be useful but I'm happy to have long intervals between plays because if this is the only game there is time for, it might be as well to end the session and if you have long enough for two game you could play 7 Wonders instead.

You move a stone along a squiggly line. You lose if you fall off the map or run into another player. Those are the rules. It is simple and quick, but it is a beautiful game. I was able to teach this to friends who speak limited English, and we speak little Italian. However, it went great, so much so that one ordered it the next day. Additionally, it scales well for different player numbers.

RATING: 6
A really fantastic game for introducing yourself or others to table top games. 

Tsuro absolutely beautifully designed and packaged. The whole thing looks and feels so elegant and plays that way too. Even the catalogue of other games from calliope is a thing a beauty.

Tsuro's rules can be explained in seconds allowing you to jump straight into play with anyone. It's for two - eight players and works well with any number of those. 

For none gamers it's a really satisfying quick game which in seconds to explain and ten minutes or so to play, shows that there's more to board games than they thought and for gamers it's an elegant mini game, perfect for a quickie or appetizer.

So easy to learn, yet very fun to play. It's a game that works almost always due to it's "lightness". It fits just as well as an only game for a night when you're not up for pulling an all-nighter, as it does for a quick playthrough in between other more demanding games. Don't let your mind slack off too much though, or you'll accidentally run yourself off the board.

As if Metro was such a great game, somebody decided to produce a copycat.  Tsuro's box and components come with interesting Asian motif and calligraphy (Chinese or Japanese?) but the gameplay has only minor differences with Metro.  It is as chaotic and lack of control is as pronounced. At least this one is shorter and the tiles are nicer to look at. It's very unlikely that I play this ever again.

Very light game that's clever and fun, but not overly stressful.  You can easily get taken out of the game before it ever comes back around to your turn, so you don't really feel so bad about losing.

Tsuro is a good simple game. Enjoyable even with 8 players, although downtime can be a bit of a drag. The winner often is determined more by luck than skill, but the beauty of this game is in its accessibility and quick play time. Perfect for a filler or introducing new gamers to the hobby.

I thought it was really cool after watching TableTop, so I bought it, really enjoyed it at first, but the appeal quickly wore off. I almost never play this anymore and feel empty when I do. Winning/losing doesn't feel like anything was accomplished/lost. Looking to trade/sell. The components are beautiful though (that rice paper too!), and the theme is rather nice. Just not enough depth for me I guess.

This is hardly a game - it's more a pretty collection of bits that interests people more than a coin-flipping contest would.
It's amazing how many people will happily play this and call it a game. While the game gives the illusion that you have choices (because you have multiple tiles to place on the gorgeous board), none of the choices actually make any difference. The majority of plays it is a coinflip, as to who happens to go last or have the right tile to win. The good thing about Tsuro are the components, and the short timelength. 

Unlike almost every other game I've ever played, it does seriously make me question whether or not it deserves a 1.

A fun and interesting filler game that did pretty well with out group, but a couple of the rules (particularly the dragon tile rules) were so poorly written as to be incomprehensible.  In large part because of this, this game has not hit the table in a long time.

RATING: 8
A quick filler of a game with some gorgeous production in the rulebook and the box an board art.  The "Stones" were not as appealing, and could have been more bottom heavy to reduce tipping over.  The gameplay is pretty quick and simple, but the management of luck in your tile draws is key.  Play becomes more of a challenge and better with 3 people than it did with two. Not a mentally taxing game, but one that will reward a bit of risk analysis.

this is an o.k. filler/party game. not much to the decisions you'll be asked to make during the game. pick up a tile, hope the track on it allows a placement that doesn't force you out of the game, and maybe forces another player out of the game in an entertaining way. yadda, yadda. fun with the right crowd, as it can be pretty funny to watch a piece follow a long path across the board that eliminates one or more players. personally i would have to be in the right mood to dedicate game time to this. maybe fun for non-gamers.

Zen Style Tile Laying Game. 2 - 8 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is super easy to learn and very quick to teach, which makes this game an excellent candidate for playing with non-gamers.  I also like how this game can handle up to 8 players.  I've played this game with 8 numerous times, and had a good time.  The amount of strategy required by this game isn't much, so don't expect a heavy strategic experience.  Whether you survive or not depends heavily on what tiles you draw and what the other players do.

Tsuro is not the type of game you will constantly play over and over, every chance you can get.  But it's a great game to bring out every once in a while and play a couple times, especially if you're with non-gamers or a larger group.  I've never played this game with anyone who hated the game.  So if you're the type of person who tends to break out the games and lead people in gaming, I would recommend having this in your collection.

Simple tile laying game with beautiful art and components. Always a good pick after playing a long game to give your mind a break. Takes about two minutes to teach and the longest a game typically goes is near ten minutes. Can play up to eight but I don't think I would go over six, personally. Good casual game as a warm up or cool down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a quick little game that can be a little thinker. Contrary to what some say, there is strategy to the game: get rid of your symmetric tiles and save your asymmetric ones. Why? The tiles that are the same no matter how you turn them are the ones that give you less options on your turn. The ones that are weird and have asymmetric patterns give you MORE options. It's also language independent and beautiful. It plays fast and it fits up to 8.

My only grips are that it tries to be something that it probably isn't. It's not really a party game as it's still one of those silent thinker games. It plays fast, but it doesn't have that meat or give off that sense of accomplishment that thinking games do. So basically, the speed of play and the large amount of players make a party game probably a better choice for that. The type of game probably makes a Euro more suitable.

Overall, it's still a decent game I'll play here and there. A huge plus was that I was able to play it with my relatives who do not speak native English. Who knew the path the game refers to: "game of the path" meant death?

That's it?  The entire point of this game is to avoid moving you piece anywhere near where other players are placing tiles.  Once things get tight, the entire game is a matter of pure luck.  Now, with 2 players (maybe 3, max), this might have the faintest feeling of a game, but 5 was definitely way too many.  This game would be more interesting if the goal was to simply create the longest path (with the caveat that no two pieces can share a path).  Unfortunately, that's not the game.

I feel like there's no game here. Seems like every time I play everyone's pieces start falling off the board or hitting into eachother around the same time. A bigger board might help this, but at the moment it feels like you're just laying tiles for the sake of laying tiles. No real control.

RATING: 6
Quick little tile laying game.  Nice as a filler, but grows stale quickly if played too often.

Positives:
- My kids enjoy this game.  Its quick and its fun for them to move the stones along the paths.
- The tiles are nice and thick.  I like the art.
- Despite the flaws (see below), I still have fun playing this game in small doses.  The "fun factor" is there, it just needs to be experienced in small doses.

Negatives:
- Players can be eliminated rather quickly - this can cause some beginners to become disillusioned.
- Lots of luck.
- The Dragon tile's function is explained quite poorly.  Once you understand what they are trying to say, its function is quite simple (basically its a reminder of who should get the next tile when one becomes available due to the elimination of another player) but the wording is vague in the printed directions.

Very simple rules (except for what to do when/if you run out of tiles....dragon tile, etc...).  Great game for kids.

Just figured out the Dragon tile.   When someone is knocked out of the game their card(s) are shuffled and given to the players.....starting with the player holding the dragon tile.   At first I couldn't figure out how you'd get add'l tiles back into the game.

I'd call this relaxing. There's a minimum amount of strategy, but it's kind of fun to put tiles down and see what happens. I've taught this to non-gamers, as it's very easy to pick up on. I wouldn't really recommended it to anyone as an example of what modern gaming is all about.

Though I can say that this game has some of the best components and packaging I've ever seen.

This game is similar to the feel of Metro, except every player has one "train" and when it terminates, they are done.  Some more choices in that you have a hand of tiles to pick from, so you can have some limited effect on the course of events.  I've seen the game end  on a fluke tie (creating a tie) and a mutual destruction (creating a tie) both of which resulted in a  less than satisfying game.  It's quick so I'll still play it, but I won't pull it off of a shelf myself.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I'm really surprised this is not higher on the abstract games list. It is a very simple game, players taking it in turn to place tiles infront of their piece. The objective is give your piece a clear path to continue and cause the other players pieces to crash back into the edge of the board. Fairly light, but a fun abstract that works well with a group, and importantly the finish both in terms of production quality but also the theme (love the little dragon stones that represent the players) is brilliant - it almost gives a sense that Tibetan monks might have studied this 2000 years ago.

This game is pretty "meh".

The entire game revolved around avoiding other players. If too many players start beside you, you'll probably lose. The only good bit is that it's practically impossible to be put out of the game until quite close to the end. 

Its positive is that it seems like a good game to non-gamers and is easy to teach and learn. So that's the only real reason I'd consider playing it now.

Simple, quick, and a nice aesthetic.

Tsuro is great to pack when going to a board game party if you don't know how experienced a lot of the guests are as gamers. Everyone can play Tsuro, and it takes seconds to teach it. Plus, it supports a large number of players. Games are pretty quick, but are satisfying, keeping even the players who were eliminated engaged until the end, eager to see if the person who knocked them out suffers a similar fate.

I won't usually pull out Tsuro if my group consists of more experienced gamers, since we're usually looking for something a bit longer or at least a little more complex, but Tsuro has its place. It serves well as an introduction or stepping-stone for newer gamers, and is nice for veterans in the mood for something lighter.

As a filler game it's a bit long, but it can help balance out an evening that includes a three hour epic or some other complicated game.

BUT, there isn't really a game here.... you just put a tile down in front of your pawn, move your pawn along the path, and try to avoid others.  That's it.  Since it's so random and chaotic, there really isn't a strategy to the game.

Simple yet enjoyable game that plays in about 10 minutes. Definitely not for in depth strategy gamers. If you are consider this or Tsuro of the seas choose Tsuro of the seas.  This has very few decisions and is a little too basic for me.  However big props to such a beautiful board and pieces.  A fun light game to play with the kids.

This is a surprise from a company I have learned to dislike passionately.  Tsuro is kinda like Metro Lite.  Games are always going to be quick barring Analysis Paralysis, and the production of the game is beautiful.  This is the only Wiz Kids game I wont scowl at...  but I still would only have a passing interest in playing it too often.

This is my go-to game for people who are completely new to designer board games.  The gameplay is so simple you can explain it and be playing within a minute, and the beauty of the board and tiles and elegance of the gameplay is so attractive to people that it draws them in.  You simply lay a tile to extend the current flight path of your dragon, fly around the board without going off the sides or flying into anybody, and be the last dragon standing (or flying, rather).

The game's simplicity and aesthetic can make for very relaxing game sessions, but these can also be competitive and tense with the right crowd.  It plays between 2 and 8 players equally well, and games last between 5 and 15 minutes.  Instant rematches are very common.  

The game's simplicity not only makes it work as a gateway game and filler, it also allows for nearly endless variation.  The rules out of the box are fine, and work very well as a game, but my gamegroup has found ways to liven the game up even beyond those first few gateway plays with tons of house rules.  You can play in teams, or with individual players controlling multiple dragons.  You can vary the tile distribution, giving players more choices to make, with face-up or down tiles.  You can use the dragon tile as an obstacle on the board to avoid.  There is a lot of game here, and Tsuro will remain in my collection for decades to come, because it has been that successful for me.  Top marks, one of my first designer games, and one of my favorites.

This is a great warm-up game for a night of gaming.  It's simple, light, quick, yet no two games are the same.  Players have and place tiles on a board and follow the path their tiles have created.  Eventually your path will lead you off the board.  The final player on the board wins.  The game really becomes interesting when your path intersects with someone else's path in which case your path may no longer be your own.

Tsuro is a great 'Filler' game. It plays well with any number of players up to 8.
We use it to occupy our time while waiting for the rest of the gaming group to arrive.
Everyone we've introduced it to - thoroughly enjoys it.

Some like it for it's simplicity and ease of play, some like it for the speed with which a game can be played, and some like to over-think it and attempt to use a 'strategy' to succeed in the game.

Either way, much fun is had and it was well worth the price paid.

Gorgeous components, super simple gameplay, and very quick. You won't shred any neurons playing this one. Just admire the components and soon enough it's over. The board is a grid of squares, suitable for placing tiles. Each tile has four strings depicted, and each tile edge shows two strings entering/exiting. On the edges of the board are hash marks, with two leading into each edge square (or four on the corners). Players take a very pretty pawn and place it on a hash mark. Tiles are shuffled face down and everyone takes three. The rest are stacked. Players take turns, play a tile, and draw a tile. On your turn, you place a tile in front of your piece, in the square, so that all the strings (or hash marks) line up. Then you move your piece along the string to the end. If this leads you to an edge of the board (to another hash mark) you lose, your pawn is removed, and your tiles return to the stack. If this leads you to another player, you both lose. If your tile placement happens to be in front of another player's pawn, they move as well, following their string to the end and suffering the same consequences for collision or exiting the board. There's a little strategy: aim for the empty areas; if there's a gap between you and an opponent, fill it, and try to make it so they are forced off map; try to block out opponents to keep empty areas to yourself. I have seen this game end in a draw, whereby all tile placements are forced, and it leads players into a fatal head bump. At a certain point it's very likely the stack will be depleted. When this happens, the first player who cannot draw takes the dragon marker. As soon as someone loses, the player with the dragon tile gets first dibs on the replinished stack, and pass the dragon tile to their left. It's a cute game, not strategically bereft, but nothing deep here. But garsh it's pretty. Good for a warm up game, especially with newbies in the mix.

If it were less Pretty, it'd probably get a much lower score.  Its other saving grace is its extremely short playtime and incredible ease of picking up.  Mechanically the game isn't really interesting at all, but it's a pleasure to look at, and I've enjoyed playing it every time I have.  We usually start out game nights with a few rounds of Tsuro nowadays.  I first played this game on a prerelease version which had a nicer cardstock than the stuff they used in the final version (the tiles were a nice plasticky laminate instead of some good-quality cardboard).  If those pieces had been included here, I'd have bumped my rating to an 8, since so much of my enjoyment of the game derives from how aesthetically-pleasing the game is.

2012 Birthday gift for Zack from Julia

A quick and easy abstract strategy tile laying game with beautiful Asian artwork and distinctive "dragon stone" player pieces.  It looks phenomenal on your coffee table and it plays from 2-8 players in 20-30 minutes.  The only downside is that there can be swift changes of momentum in the game leading to unexpected player eliminations.  As a starter filler game at a game day or game night this is a great choice for new gamers to explore tile laying for the first time.

I enjoy connection games a fair amount, so it was a given that I would seek out a play of this game.  In a lot of ways, it seems similar to Metro in that you lay tiles to extend your line.  Granted the tiles are random, but I feel as though you do have some meaninful control of what you are doing.  It is also nice that it can support so many players, though I have never played with more than two.  Overall, it is a pleasant enough game.  It is not interesting enough for me to add to my collection (too many train game preclude that) but it is a fair enough game for what it is and one that I would easily play if asked. [12/29/2009]

A decent and quick lightweight game. After 9 games, I have a half-baked strategy of playing tiles with multiple straight paths early (as those are less flexible late in the game) and to avoid encroaching into another player's area (as that player has a big advantage in sending you to a premature end). Just don't take this a serious, thinky abstract game and this will be pretty fun. I also love the authentic looking playing pieces.

Players are trying to be the last on the board. Each turn, they lay out Metro-like tiles and move their piece to the end of the path on the tile. Any other pieces that are linked by the placed tile also moves to the end of the connected path. Last man standing wins!

Great presentation (The design is fantastic) and scales up to 8 (!) players. However, don't bother with 3 or less. The more the better. Sure, there's luck and screwage, but it's a filler. Laugh it off and play another round or three.

I like the graphic design on Tsuro, but that's about it. I didn't really enjoy playing it. Tsuro is kind of a puzzle game, but it isn't the kind of puzzle I like. Sorry I can't say anything more specific - I played it a few years ago and just recall that I have no desire to every play it again.

A great, simple game.  Lots of luck of the draw, and the dragon tile mechanic is a little confusing if you don't understand it's intent, but a fun game nonetheless.

Tsuro is an amazing game, unique, elegant, simple, short, and a lot of fun. I almost always use Tsuro as a warm up game to start the night off while we wait for other people and to that effect the game is great. Don't buy this game expecting to get a whole evening out of it, but it's a great in between game to start the night off, or introduce to younger/newer board game players.

RATING: 2
A filler game that stays in its lane -- extremely short, and doesn't outstay it's welcome!

This, moreso than just about any other gmae I know though, is 100% a filler. So something I would never opt to play on its own merit, but instead just a way to agreeably pass time if other people are into it and something good is coming up.

But playing this, while mostly harmless, would be a selfless act.

This should have been called Sewer-o! with rats running around in tunnels.  This is a pleasant enough distraction, but I'm not sure how much game is actually here.  I almost want to give this a 5 rather than the 3 because it is short and painless and is kind of fun to find out what the results are, but I just can't do it in good conscious.  I'm not sure how much you can actually effect your standing.

Someone mentioned that if you could get Nunzilla to walk along the tracks it would be a much better game.  They are right.  I love Nunzilla.

A neat concept for a game, but has some pacing problems.  The first 75% of the game is very random since you don't really know how the board is going to fill out, and then the game crawls to a halt for the last 25% or so as players agonize over the limited choices they have to work with in an attempt to outlast the other players.  

Makes for a nice 10-15 minute filler game, but a little too big/expensive of a filler to justify having in my collection.

This is a tile-laying game reminiscent of Metro, except that you have one piece that you're trying to keep on the board with the longest path.  It's not bad; I'd like to try it with more players to see how it holds up.

UPDATE: While not amazing, it's a fun and quick filler.  Moving up to a 7.

UPDATE #2:  Have to move up to an 8, simply because it's great for what it is, which is just a quick-moving tile game.

Very nice little tile-laying track-making game.  Very simple rules and short playing time.  But some agonising decisions along the way.  A great filler game, that plays 2-8 people (but I would think more than 5 might be a bit too chaotic).  Beautifully prodiced too, with zen-like overtones.  Recommended.

It's a simple game: you play on a grid marked with lines. Each player puts their marker on the edge. On your turn, you play 1 of the 3 tiles in your hand in front of your token. The tiles show paths - after playing, you move all tokens touching the new tile to the end of their path. If any token hits another token or falls off the edge of the board, they are eliminated - you get to choose one of their tiles and add it to your hand. If everyone survives, you instead draw a replacement tile from the stack. Keep playing until only 1 player is alive.

This is a fun, fast game, but too random with 8 players - the tile selection is extremely limited, and it seems like survival is mostly luck of the draw. Still, an easy filler.

I like this game a lot.  Plenty of strategy and messing with the other players' gameplay, but enough random chance that your fate is not completely in your hands.

I played it at the local game store and could tell immediately it's not my type of game due to the tile laying.  I don't like Metro either, so this one really does not inspire me.

This game is super simple and plays in like 6 minutes.  Each player has a piece that they put on one end of a grid then each turn the players play a tile on the board that moves their piece.  If a player moves off the board or crashes into another player then that player loses.  Last one standing is the winner.

It's fine for that 6 minutes but past that there's no meat on the bones.

I have the feeling that I shouldn't like this simple game but I do.  I've played half a dozen 2-player games and have found that to get the most out of the game you have to force a confrontation rather than just mosey around the board trying to outlast your opponent.  I can't imagine playing with 8 people but 3 or 4 might be interesting. 
Update: After 10 plays, raised rating to an 8.  This is still only for 2 player games, which are a lot of fun since we like to play it as a push-your-luck type of game. 

Would like to get a second copy for my daughter.

RATING: 4
Simple multiplayer abstract, with some serious endgame issues. What happes if all remaining players fall of the board while playing the last tile? And what if a remaining player has no tile left?

But even apart from that, it's so short and chaotic, that it seems somewhat pointless, especially with more players.

Easy to teach, simple to play, and beautiful to look at.   Unfortunately that's about all there is to it.  It is engaging a few times but about 90% luck since all you can do is place tiles which may or may not lead to your doom once the players come in contact.  Once the players tiles are in contact, there is a modicum of tactics as  you attempt to use one of your limited 3 tiles to keep yourself looping back, or perhaps send your opponent off.

In fact the "game" is not really a game so much as an interactive piece of performance art.  There are few, and perhaps no, interesting or thoughtful decisions to be made--quite literally at all.  There is no deciding which tile might be better or safer to lay--it's either a clear choice, or there is no way to tell what effect the tile will have.  But, nonetheless, it is fun to slide your pawn along the loopy track as it forms--and it's a much fun to see where you end up as your opponents begin to lay tiles.

Easy enough for kids, although my daughter isn't particularly enamored by such abstract games, she (age 9) much prefers games with a story arc of some sort.

The game is short enough that I would play it again, but I would not ever request it--there are much more intellectually engaging games that play in the same amount of time.

This is a "first impression" rating after a single play with 3 players.  That's right, I have the nerve to rate this game after less than 10 minutes of playing time!  Anyhow, Tsuro gives the impression that it could be similar to a beautiful woman who you fall madly in love with, but then quickly realize she has a very shallow personality.  I love "maze-like movement games" where you create clever movement paths, such as Quoridor and Hey! That's My Fish!, and to a lesser extent The aMAZEing Labyrinth.  So after my first play, my first thought was, "This is so simple and so fun - I must own this game!".  But then when I thought about it for a bit, I realized that there seems to be too few meaningful decisions during the game to create a lasting replayability.  The first few tiles set a somewhat random groundwork, and then the rest of the game seems to consist of fairly obvious decisions.  Playing with 3 was fun, and I imagine 4 or even 5 would be too, but with 6-8 players I'd want the board to be at least double the size it is now, otherwise each player would just be laying a few tiles and would have very little control over what happens to their pawn.  As for the artwork, well, let's just say that the large, hideously-ugly bird on the game board discourages analysis paralysis by motivating players to get their tiles on the board quicker.  Now don't get me wrong - I very much enjoyed my first play.  I'm just not convinced that the game carries enough weight for repeated plays or for larger groups of players.  Tso to tsum up, Tsuro is a wonderfully tsimple, fun and tstrategic game that perhaps doesn't have enough meaningful decisions to add it to my collection.

RATING: 5.5
[WizKids 2005 edition] {Party; puzzle, tile-laying, player-elimination} Tsuro is an abstract tile-laying game, in which players' pawns travel along established paths on the board. If a player's pawn has to move out of the board, he is eliminated.  The winner is the last one standing on the board.

It is an ok gateway game for families but I think it isn't good enough for gamers.  Decisions each turn is very simple and the goal is very clear; however, it is quite random (esp. with many players) and this makes it difficult to predict moves in future steps.  I think gamers would prefer Metro.  For families, the game is short enough to be fun.  I think Tsuro is better with 3-5 players.  8-players game is also ok, but the game becomes chaotic and comes with longer down time.  Nonetheless, I quite like this game despite its randomness.  It is a no-brain choice for a group of new players.

The game is nicely produced.  The board and player pawns are attractive.  And the rulebook is pretty and clear.  But the dragon tile is somewhat useless even though it is a good reminder.

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

I'm concerned that there really isn't that much control and many if not all decisions are no brainer decisions.  But interesting enough for an occassional play, and I would object to playing on occassion.  Gains a few points for quick play. 06/06 upped a bit,  for a filler this is  fast and fun game.  Frankly we laugh our asses off every time we play.

This makes for a great filler.  The attractive board and bits draw people in, it only takes 15 minutes, and you can play with 8 players!  A great way to wrap up a game night.  Tsuro feels like the party version of Metro.  The solitaire variant is fun, too.  This game appeals as much to heavy gamers as it does to casual gamers so it works well as a short fitter with a mixed group.

A gateway game, very light, with tile laying and movement. I find the gameplay to be too shallow and random to really want to play it again. On the plus side, it's very pretty and fast to play, not to mention good for 2-8 players. Not a mainstay, but it fills a niche.

Tsuro is about the easiest game I've ever played.  I doubt there is any sort of strategy at all.  Mostly the game is all about luck.  But it's a fun game to play and it only takes about 5 minutes.  Not a bad starter game for game nights.

This game is so simple I considered not giving it as high a rating, but I have to be generous since so many people I have played this with have praised the general idea and theme of the game, despite how simple it is.  Its ability to also do 2 up to a huge crowd of people is insane since the way the game mechanics work, either group of people is equally good.  It is the only game I own that I can play with any number of people at my party and not worry about how it plays.

My only complaint is that I wish the colored stones looked more like dragons.  They are the least interesting piece of the whole game and they are your characters!

Tsuro is by far the most beautiful game I own. I'm amazed every time I open the box and take in the quality pieces--even the rule book is lovely! It was worth the price alone just for that, but the gameplay is quite nice as well. It's an abstract strategy game, but the elegance of the theme almost transcends the abstract nature. We can get goofy with it, crowning the winner the "most enlightened dragon," but it IS fun to swoop around the board pretending you're a large, fantastical creature overlooking your domain. It has the possibility of growing stale with too many plays (or perhaps I just get bored easily) and the indirect conflict can become tedious with fewer people, but in general it's a great add to any collection.

Quick and enjoyable.  Good with 2 players.  It's definitely a lite-strategy game, but does keep you thinking as you consider your options, and react to your opponents decisions.  The fast pace makes it great for casual/social play, and also makes it great as a warm-up game before a heavier strategy title.  Usually finishes in 10 minutes or less.

This was a gift. It's...pleasant? I guess? But doesn't have a lot of strategy or player involvement. I'd MAYBE play as a cooldown at the end of a night with a lot of players. But would probably rather just call it a night than "play" Tsuro. 

I like Indigo better, especially as an opening game when just four people are around. Definitely takes the base mechanics in Tsuro but provides more choices and strategy to make a better gaming experience.

Don't be fooled by the simplicity. Tsuro is a fun game to play with any number of players - although the more the merrier. It also plays very fast so there can be plenty of chances for revenge. You can see our [thread=528895]full family video review of Tsuro here.[/thread]

This game is simple, fast and surprisingly elegant for what it is. The artwork, I think, is what makes the game work. Without it, I suspect I would look at the game differently and find it to be flat, 2 dimensional. The more players invovled, the faster the game goes (assuming you don't have someone trying to accomplish the impossible by making a tile do something it will not do). The choices are limited, but it is possible to plan ahead to ensure some degree of longevity for your piece. It worked well as a side game while dealing with downtime at a heavier table.

I love this game. It's one of my top games to breakout for getting a game night started. It plays fast, it's easy to add players into it. It's not too brain stretching so it's good to play with people who are less likely to want to play board games. The tiles are really nice, and the dragon tokens look nice, I always just want them to have a bit more heft. Definitely a game that I would recommend as an essential game to own.

RATING: 7
It is hard to be simpler than [thing=16992][/thing]: the players put tiles (picking one of 3 they have in hand) on the board and move their pieces by the lines. Try not to follow a line that leads out of the board. The winner is the last player still in the board. Done, game explained.

At the start, not falling off the board is easy, but once the tiles start to get together, the lines grow longer and are harder to follow, and your piece can ended up going to an unwanted place. Also, the other players, when you are closer to them, will try to put their tiles in a way that is makes a safe movement for them, but push your piece off the board. 

[thing=16992][/thing] is an extra-light game, able to have up to 8 players, a mighty number. But, unlike [thing=68448][/thing], play isn't simultaneous, and, though the game [i]is[/i] light, sometimes choosing the proper tile to put, while considering all the paths that they can lead your (or someone else) piece, can lead to some AP and downtime - therefore, playing with 8 might not ideal. Four to six seems to be the sweet spot. Though, even with 8, I can't see the game went on for too long, as eliminations will happen faster.

The game is all about interacting with the board and other players, specially when playing with higher numbers, as the tiles the other put will have a big impact in the movement of your piece.

[thing=16992][/thing] has some amount of randomness, in the form of the draw of tiles. Sometimes you just won't have the tile you need to get way and stay on the board. But this is lessened by the fact that players have 3 tiles in hand, and when using one, they draw another. This allow for more control over your destiny.

As for the components, [thing=16992][/thing] is a nice looking game, with some great pieces and tiles, and the board has a nice art. The tactile factor is there.

Overall, [thing=16992][/thing] is a neat filler, able to cope with a good lot of players while still being somewhat fast. The decisions are meaningful, but aren't hard to be made. Anyone can play it - from kids to elders. It can be teached in 2 minutes and played in 20. I can see the game working really well with families and also with groups of veterans board gamers. [thing=16992][/thing], for me, isn't in the same league as [thing=172][/thing], [thing=34219][/thing] or [thing=2842][/thing] in greatness factor, but is easier to be played than the first two, and is faster than [thing=2842][/thing]. [thing=16992][/thing] can be a good option for those that liked [thing=37759][/thing] but wanted a game with less luck involved, while still being as fast and easy - still, be mindful that the game has player elimination, and even in fast games this might not work well with some people.

RATING: 6
Tsuro is a light, simple game that can be taught quite easily to new players. With higher player counts, player elimination happens early and often unavoidably for unlucky players, but the brevity of the game means another can start shortly.

With lower player counts, the game starts slowly and with very little player interaction, to the point that we often play a variation using tile drafting rather than individual player hands. We also sometimes use the dragon tile as an obstacle placed on the board at the beginning of the game by the first player.

The art on the board and tiles is beautiful, and the player tokens are solid and attractive.

Fine for a filler. Simple but not obvious, quick but not pointless, nice components. The dragon tile makes sense only when you learn it from a person, and not from the rules. Not something I'd rush to, but I won't turn down a 5-minute game if someone wants to play.

Ranking as a kids/family game.  Great with the 4/5 year old kid.  We started out playing blind (= no cards in hand, draw one from a face-down pile on your turn), now graduated to playing with cards in hand for more strategizations.  Beatiful, fun, short.  Play with a reserve of smarties for more evil fun:  every time someone "smooshes" you, they get to eat a smartie.  All smarties gone?  You are out.

I liked Tsuro at first in part because it was so good to play with non-gamers.  Thing is, it's just soooo light and fluffy.  And then Indigo came out.  If I have the choice of playing something with more interesting choices that has similar gameplay and lasts only a little bit longer I'm going with that game.  In this case, that means Indigo.  Tsuro is like a display piece - pretty, but not super functional.  I could see keeping it if 1)you play non-gamers a lot and/or 2)you like a lot of variety in your collection.  For me it was a no-brainer to ditch after getting Indigo.

Really high production value for such a simple tile-laying game: be the last man standing on the path while attempting to make your opponent fall off the edge or crash. Fills a particular niche as it's one of very few fillers that can be played by 8 people within 15-20 minutes. However, seems to hit its sweet spot at about 5-6 players - 4 players makes for a more strategic game but to me the luck elements, multi-player chaos and short playing time makes makes this best suited as a fun activity with budding or non-gamers or as a late-night filler to wind down with one more little game.

RATING: 9
Great game for kids age 5 and up.

Short filler game, with a really simple, elegant, and pretty design. Almost all luck, but it's fun and one of my favorite filler games. Great to play with non-gamers, as well as with small children, as there is no reading involved and just minimal strategy. Downside: it's got a musical-chairs last-man-standing dynamic, where folks are pushed off the board one by one, so if it's the only game going on, players will have to wait until it narrows down to one winner. So while it's perfect for including small children, they hate it when they are pushed off first. Losing worst plus being excluded while the rest are playing isn't fun for small kids, even though it's a fairly short wait at that point until the end. Alternatively, with only 3 or 4 players (you can play with up to 8 players), you can play cooperatively, where the goal is to not let anyone get pushed off the board, and have everyone meet together in the middle on the dragon tile after all the other tiles have been placed. Playing this way is more challenging and I find it much more fun. I've cooperatively won with 3 players several times, but it's very hard to do with 4 or more, though it's possible. Finally, there is a newer version, Tsuro of the Seas, which I don't like nearly as well as the original.

This is probably the most disappointing game I have purchased.  I've bought other games I can't get played because the rules are confusing or they take too much time (and we never have enough time for a long game), but this one is just plain...not fun.

If you're playing with less than *at least* 4P, it's very quick.  Painfully quick - it's boring. If you have a group of 6-8 people and just need a casual filler for holiday parties, it might be okay,  But, otherwise, there are so many better short, filler games for 2-3P environments that this one just isn't worth it.  I really wanted to like it, but it's going down as a 3.5-4.

This game felt brilliant in it's simplicity when I first got it.  Now that it's seen about a dozen plays though, it barely gets play, even as a filler.  Still fun and light, I'm happy to play it on occasion as I love tile laying.

Fortunately, it's easy and quick enough, I'm pretty much always willing to play it, and it's great to have a no-brainer game for so many players.

OK, here's the idea: get at least 6 players, start in the same quadrant, and use the Dragon simply as the Instant Death Trap variant, where whoever pulls it places it somewhere on the board...if you fall into the dragon, you die.  THEN the game works like a mad dash through some kind of Chinese hell.  Otherwise, yeah...the stock rules teach you how to play a practically broken game.

Has many of the elements of games that I like: Metro, Linie 1.  Yet I feel each turn there is NO decisions. I could basically turn over a card from my hand at random and do just as well as if I picked one.  I'll play it only because it is over quick and handles a group larger than six for a few minutes.  Oh yes I also will only play if I can be black and someone else is white so I can say:  "Ah incisor...so we meet again!"

Place a path tile, advance your pawn on the path created, don't run into anyone else or off the board or you're out of the game. Last player standing wins. Extremely fast and simple, I picked it up because it was on sale, gorgeous, and handles 8 players. Almost nothing plays 8, a nice filler for large groups. We actually played it 2 player, with 2 pawns each, whoever lost both pawns first was the loser. Worked just fine.

An interesting abstract.  So far I've played with one other player.  With just two it is a bit slow with not a whole lot going on.  We then played two colors each and that made the game move faster and led to more interesting combinations.  I think it would be more fun to play with a large group.

A very quick maze game. Try to stay on the board by laying tiles in front of your piece and moving him forward. Don't hit the edge or run into another player. An 8 player game shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. 1% challenge and 99% fun.

Try to stay as long ass possible on the board.

Each tile had 4 ropes (so 4 exits) on it. You can choose how to place it but you must follow the pad. Problems occurs when players meet and you get on their pad.

RATING: N/A
A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn. The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8. Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Is winning more the result of careful placement, or the random tile draw?  I don't know, but the game plays so quickly that I wouldn't have a problem either way.  There is a tactical game to be played, in that you want to (a) avoid other players, while (b) leaving yourself a lot of space to work with.  If you isolate yourself in a corner, there's a good chance you're going off the board on your next turn.

Looks nice, although some of the colors are a little difficult to differentiate in poor lighting.  Plays quickly.  Can easily be dismissed as having no strategy, which I disagree with, although it's certainly not *deep* strategy as there is too much chaos at work.  You might have no winner, but the game is so quick you don't feel cheated.  I would play again happily, but I could see how you might burn out on the game quickly.  Curious to see how it stands up under many plays.

Tsuro is, in my opinion, the best game to play with people who are 100% new to board games.  The rules explanation is so simple as to be almost self explanatory (Though, there have been people who just don't get the concept).  The game is simple, and is extremely luck dependent.  Which is not terrible for a 20 minute filler game.  The game also scales beautifully.  Playing well with 2 players as well as 8, without much increase in the length of the game.

So, simple, beautiful game, best for new players.  The game is great for what it is.

Lay tile, move along a line, repeat, repeat, repeat. This game is no fun at all. If your playing with 5 players or less your basically playing solitaire with yourself until the end of the game and if your playing with a higher count of people(6-8) you will be lucky to get 4 or 5 turns in the game! The artwork is ok which prevents this one from getting a 1 or 2 but if your looking for fun steer clear of this game because it will put your game group to sleep!!

Tsuro - the game of the path. Got this one for Christmas from my sister-in-law and love it! It is the quickest game to learn that I have ever played, plays in about 10 minutes, and changes with each play. just as fun 2-player as it is with 6. Not only is it a blast to play but the Asian-inspired artwork is beautiful and elegant. This will easily be THE game I use to introduce non-gamers to board games and get them hooked!

I like this one, but it's not one I like to play more than once or twice in a night because it is so simple and can feel repetitive.

*Owned for school - three copies*  My students are enjoying Tsuro this year, but placing the tiles without bumping the board can be a challenge for them.  For a classroom setting, I think the game plays best with four or five players.  With a full complement, students lose track of turn order and can get distracted.

RATING: 4
The images of this game evoke the idea of higher quality pieces than they are.  I would've thought they're finely carved stone tokens, and solid plastic tiles on a wooden board -- at least, until I saw the comparably low price.  Still, the pieces are nice enough -- plastic tokens, thin plastic coated tiles and a cardboard board.  The game is light, though, and purely tactical.  Select a tile to place adjacent to your piece, then trace a path to the edge of a tile, off the board (which loses), or into another piece (which both lose.)  Then trace other tokens the same way if they were adjact to the placed piece.

This classy looking game seems like it belongs in a tea house. It would fit the game's vaguely Far Eastern asthetic and really, what could be more relaxing than pushing stones around on a bunch of tiles?

Game play is completely abstract and easy enough to teach a 5 year old, yet it still can get thinky if you let it. this belongs in any collection that sees a lot of inexperienced players, as it's a great ice breaker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the fastest games to teach new players you will ever find.  Pick a start point. Draw three tiles. Lay down a tile and move your dragon. Draw a new tile. You go off the board, you lose. You end up traveling the same path and direction as another dragon, you both lose. Last dragon standing or if you are still on the board when all the tiles have been played, you win.  And that is it.  All the tiles are unique so there is no way to card count a strategy.  You just need to think on the fly (dragon...fly....ha!).  Beautiful art and the tokens have a stone like feel to them despite being plastic. One of the best games in my collection. highly recommended.

I am not a huge fan of this one. I find it a bit boring. I never really buy in to what I am trying to do. I have no emotional attachment. On the surface, it seems more fun with more players, but the more players there are the more time is spent NOT playing the game. And occasionally you can't even prepare your turn because the game state can change by the time it gets back to you. It is quick, however, and just about everyone else I have played this game with enjoys it. So maybe I'm just missing something...

My understanding is that colliding luckstones are eliminated due to a matter/antimatter implosion.

Such nihilism in a family game is unexpected, but who am I to fault the designer for his creative whims.

RATING: 6
Played twice (with 7-8 players). A game with beautiful components and very simple rules. However, you have very little control on what happens outside your turn, which is a large part of the game when there are lots of players. It is probably much more controllable with 3-4 players.

Was a fairly fun "build a network of tracks" game, but inferior to the similar game "Indigo."

RATING: 9
Great, light, and very quick game that's short enough to sneak in between much heavier games or anytime you've got a few minutes to spare.

Beautiful board and high-quality components.

I find myself enjoying this more every time we play it, so I've raised my rating a bit.   It's the near-perfect gateway game - it takes literally seconds to teach, and plays in 10-15 minutes so there is always plenty of time for repeat plays or other more complex games.


The Dragon tile is far less confusing than the rules (and the frequent complainers) make it sound.   All it means is that when more tiles get added back to the empty draw pile because of a player elimination, the player holding the Dragon tile puts it on the bottom of the stack and then gets to draw a new tile first.   That's it.   Most of the time it's better to not even mention it until it actually comes up in the game.

Quick easy game for everyone. Not too deep though and a lot of luck determines who actually wins. In some ways too basic and your choices are so slim it gets a bit on the boring side after a few plays.

A good palette cleanser and can be really enjoyed by people who don't play games a lot.

Have Tsuro of the Seas, didn't really need both (you could play the originally by using only part of the board with Seas and removing the dragon aspect). Decent tile drawing and laying game, good interaction with other players. Simple to pick up and play.

First played this at PAXEast 2010.  Couldn't get enough of it, friends and I love playing this. I actually started teaching some of my students how to play as well.

RATING: 7
Very artistic and nice to look at.  Beautiful pieces.  The gameplay is simple and easy to explain. (lay a tile, move, draw)  It looks like it has fantatic potential.  But it does not work well with only 2 people. It does work fantastically with 8 though.  And probably four or more.  the gameplay is quick. (under 20 minutes even with beginners) It is fun enough that nobody seems to mind not winning, and even seem to work towards an artistic death if that's what is in the cards.  The biggest problem I have with this game is I have not found a good way to shuffle tiles yet. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My main knock on this game is the player elimination, which is kind of the point. Fortunately, Tsuro is short enough that it's not a HUGE deal, but I'm still not a huge fan of games that make player(s) sit out while the game is finished. Otherwise, it's a fun little puzzle where you try to push others off the board while keeping yourself on the board.

Excellent family board game, fast and easy. Perfect for playing with non-gamers. This "road" tile placement game is beautiful in all levels, in its simplicity resides its strength. Really good for playing with children and elderly, they'll love it! It provides a zen aspect that is a plus for me.

RATING: 7
Good party game.  Simple, cutthroat without being mean.  Games are short and don't feel cheap.  Update:  After playing many many games of this, it's lost its charm.  It's good as a filler with big groups but overall I would only want to play it if we can house rule additional complexity.

Perfect 10 for art, design and layout. Gameplay is a 7 as far as fillers go. I really like the game and its quick pace, even with the player elimination aspect -- but it didn't impress anyone else I've played it with. I *love* the art, theme and elegance of the game. The layout and style is incredibly well conceived and implemented. Feels a bit like Metro, but with only one Train to worry about... I'd like to get in more plays and see if it changes the opinion of anyone in my group.

There are times, that you have some time left, and the only thing you can do to kill some time is to play a game. But if you don’t have to much time, it’s always nice to know a game which you can set up within one minute, and the rules of it are so simple that you can explain it in two minutes, and you’ll know that a game will take about 5 minutes to play. Yesterday we suffered such a time. We had 20 minutes of a time gap. We grabbed this game. Set it up. Started playing, and 15 minutes later we finished three games of Tsuro. It’s fast. It’s easy. It’s just plain fun.

Beautifully made, simple to learn, plays in about 10 mins, but pretty bland. Elimination never really impresses me, as it's not fun for someone to sit waiting for others to lose, so the short play time is necessary. If you're looking for thick strategy or a lot of interaction between players, this is not your game.

RATING: 8
A game that has you balancing destiny and choice, Tsuro is a short and simple game of attempting to walk the longest path. Starting on the outside edge of the board, players take it in turns to place tiles with paths on in front of their stone. Their stone then moves as far as possible along the new path. As the board fills up, paths can take you to whole new areas of board. Be warned however, that making our way back to the edge, or meeting another player's stone, will get you eliminated from the game!

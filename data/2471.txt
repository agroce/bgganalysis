Found this on the clearance rack at B&N for $10. Thought I would give it a shot. The game is super long with 4-5 people. There is a lot of back-stabbing cards that made our first game drag on and on. It's simple enough to pick up and play, so I think it was a good buy.

Not much depth, but is entertaining enough to give it a try if you're curious about it.  Light and fun enough to want to play every so often.  The main thing I didn't like about the game was that so many of the action cards ended up being useless unless you were in exactly the right place at the right time.  So many of them were unused and discarded.

I waited this game to be quick and funny, like Betrayal at the House on the Hill (which I like!), but instead it turned out to be bit dull, too much of "roll the dice twice and pass the turn"... The theme is great, but gameplay was a disappointment.

Zombies!!! is a game which needs heavy houseruling in order to work and play in some reasonable timeframe.
It (and its expansions) also have awesome bits, are funny as hell, and no game "Cancer sucks!" as well as this one.

Good game.  Quick.  A lot of fun.  Easy learning curve.  From the start I wanted to mount my tiles on something heavier as a stiff breeze or a table bump will shift the whole board and all the pieces.

The theming, components, etc. are nice, but I think as a "game" (in the sense of a decision-making, intellectually challenging game) it is entirely unplayable as-is.  The large part of the game, until the heli-pad appears, is largely pointless.  In order for the game to work as it should, namely as a "light" game with a good theme and nice components, the victory condition should be completely rewritten, and the game tweaked to be a 20 to 30-minute game.  IMO, a 60-minute+ game in which most of what you do throughout the course of the game do not matter is WRONG.  If it's a 15-minute game, that's okay.

Ugh.  Random, boring, long, tedious, uninspiring.  Why a 3 instead of a 1?  Two reasons.  First, zombies.

Terrible. The game is slow and repetitive. The cards seem designed to obliterate whatever little progression was achieved.

a silly little game of screwing over your mates in as many ways possible as you fight off the Zombie hordes. It is great fun, not particularly one you will dream about afterwards but has led to some extremely great moments. One that comes to mind is me moving the escape route (a helicopter) away from the lead player and over to the other side of the board. Not a friendly tactic.

EDIT: Now totally supplanted by Left 4 Dead 2. I can get my Zombie splatting fun in full colour.

Brainless fun. Or should I say "brains-full"? Some house rules are necessary to quicken the game, though.

Now go kill some zombies in Todd's memory. He'd like that.

People keep telling me 'you can use a variant to fix the rules and make it a better game'... ... The bottom line is that this is the designers job. I expect rules problems (and am happy to work through them) in heavy wargames, not in light Ameritrash!!! The game needs A LOT of fixing. I expect when I purchase a light Ameritrash for the game to be playable, I didn't find this so.

Have only played one of  the modes that is not a scenario. Probably better playing a scenario. I felt that most of the equipment cards was tied to a location, so you had to go there to use them. Which was pointless when the helipad was discovered. The rules is not as tight and the randomness is maybe a tad high for my taste. Also felt that in the beginning, there was no point moving zombies, as you couldn't block a person completely or overwhelm him. In the end there was no more bullets to get on the map, so it was just a grind to get to the helipad.

Also the map pieces could have been printed on a card board. On a smooth surface, they moved too much.

RATING: 5.5
This game often gets a bit of an unfair treatment when compared with other zombie themed games but if you tweak a few issues it has it works much better.

For example, there is a great co-op variant for two or more players to team up - but you can still only get two people on the chopper. If you're team mate falls at the last minute do you run back to help him (must be done before it reaches the fallen players turn again) or do you leave him to die and make for the chopper yourself? 

You can also roll one die to determine who will move the zombies (6 numbers for 6 players, 3 pairs for 3 players, and discard 1 or 2 numbers in 4-5 player games) and then that person rolls again to determine how many zombies can be moved.

It's not a great game by far but the option to backstab people is appealing - sometimes.

The subject is great!  Zoooombieeees!  Heh.  I spend most of the game making zombie grunts and saying "Brains.  More brains" everytime someone moves or places a zombie.

All kidding aside, the game itself suffers from one problem.  It's slow to set up the board.  While one player is messing around with zombies and counters the other players tend to get restless.

Our group is working on some sort of house rule to speed up the board setup phase of the game.

The game is very light and funny and outright hilarious, but it needs some rules changes.  There&#039;s just waaaaaaaaaay too many zombies and one could easily stay in the same spot of the game for more than 10 turns without doing anything if people intend to screw you.

RATING: 6.5
Al principio engancha mucho. Con el tiempo, te das cuenta de que, no solo no lo echas de menos, sino que evitas jugarlo porque recuerdas algunas experiencias que no te gustaron. Hablo de la caja básica.

La partida puede hacerse pesada, aunque es económico y parece pensado para jugadores casuales. Me pareció un poco estúpido que, teniendo como objetivo matar zombies o salir por la casilla del helicóptero, haya tantas cartas para perder el tiempo en un edificio u otro (ya que sólo sirven cuando estás dentro). Todo se hace más interesante al final, cuando crece el puteo. También es donde más insoportable se hace, ya que el factor competitivo puede hacer que se tumbe al "jugador de siempre" por el que van todos. 

Jugadores: recomiendo 4+.

This can be a really fun game.  After a few plays, though, it gets a little old.  Not enough choices or something.  Maybe the numerous expansions help with that (I can't say).  But it is fun once in a while, and if someone said, "Hey let's play Zombies!!!" I'd be like, "Sure."

RATING: 8
A great game that can sometime be frustrating because of the tile drawing mechanic used to build the city. I highly recommend you use the quick play option and place the helicopter tile in the bottom third or half of the deck otherwise you can find yourself contending with a sea of zombies.  I very much like that death is never absolute, you start with a fresh character, so everyone can stay in the game and remain effective.

Card cycling is important - use the discard option as often as you can.

I would heartily recommend the "Quick Play Rules," as we managed to play a four hour game using the standard rules (there were enough people that someone could always stop any leader from ending the game).

With the quick-play rules, it's a pretty fun light game, but out of the box it's a little questionable.

RATING: 6
Zombies!!! is a decent game for the right group of players. It is very basic, so it's easy for anyone to pick up and go. However, it tends to take a very long time to finish a game, especially if you're playing with any of the expansions.

There are too many random elements to allow for much strategy, and it is almost always better to attempt to win by killing at least 25 zombies than to actually reach the helipad.

It's a decent game if I'm in the right mood, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for hardcore gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is fun, but sometimes it can get too crazy. Everyone saves all the "shaft" cards for right before someone is about to win, then shafts 'em. No one ever wins... You can't escape the zombies... So much shafting...

This is a total beer and pretzel game.  Object, make it to the helicopter before anyone else or be the first to kill 25 zombies.  This is a tile placement game in the way that you draw a tile on your turn and add it to the ever growing city.  This is fun with the right group of people.

RATING: 4
i like the theme, i like dice, i like the idea.  the execution, however, left a bit to be desired.  mostly in terms of game length, it definitely wore out its welcome with 2 players and i have no idea if it would be better or worse with more.  i would certainly be willing to revisit the game, but it would have to be using some kind of gamier and shorter variant.  i wish that more effort were put into officially sanctioned rulesets, everyone claims that there are variants out the wazoo but it doesn't seem that there's a rating system or any that would be commonly considered the best.

Can't help but feel that it gets old rapidly after several intense plays but if it is pulled out of the shelf with some time in between this keeps it's initial fun-factor. Basicaly a very mindless halloween-game (some say it's part of the fun wich I partly agree with) but also chaotic and offering little or no variation or strategy.

It's a sleazy, basic zombie survival game, but I'm not going to lie to you: this is a fun one, and that's why it has survived so long and had so many additions to its family. I do wish a lot of the item cards weren't only triggered in specific buildings that may or may not come out of the tile deck, or rather that they just had multiple uses, but this is something which an expansion might have already fixed and I'm not aware of.

Anyhow, you get multiple modes out of the box for up to six players, a big pile of zombies that look good for their size, and a bunch of tiles and cards. 3rd edition.

Fun game. The rules required a bit of head scratching to fill in a couple of holes. (This might be something to do with the way Twilight Inc write rules as my brother has Medevil and we had to 'fill in the blanks' on a couple of things there to).

If you find something inherently entertaining about a table full of Zombies surrounding a desperate handful of beleaguered heroes then you'll enjoy this.

I enjoy it and play it for a some light amusement when we fancy an old fashioned shoot 'em up.

So simple I played it with my 5 y.o. son... to his mother's horrified dismay :). It's a light game.

This is a nice miniature game specially if you like the zombie theme. The art is great and so are the components. There are plenty of fan-made rule variants on the official site; we play with the one where the number of hearts (health) determines the movement range.

Contrary to some comments, I believe the rules and the cards' effects are reasonably clear. It's not because there's an official FAQ and many variants that a game's broken.

I admit it - I haven't played this. I think I saw enough not to ever play though. A take-that game, with enough take-that cards the game is practically impossible to finish. The game I watched ended after almost 2 hours with everyone finally admitting it will never end. They just tossed the dice to determine the winner.  Take that games are pretty bad in my book, but as with this one the 'take-that' cards easily do more damage than what the players might do toward finishing the game, it's something I'll go to great lengths to avoid.

RATING: 3
Terrible terrible game.  Thought this would be fun but could not have been more wrong.  I love the components - the map, cards and zombies are all good.  Unfortunately the gameplay is awful.  Since movement and attacks are dice driven it is very random.  The cards you get are of little use as most of them require specific buildings to be of use.  It just becomes a grind as every player waits until the helipad comes out and then run towards it.  First person to bludgeon there way to it wins!  This took us around 3 hours! Goodbye after one play.

Have only played a couple of times.  Both completely different.  First time, long and fairly boring.  Second time, kind of long, but a lot more fun.  Not a super deep thinker's first choice, but would you really go for a game called Zombies!!! if you wanted to use your brain much?  It would probably get eaten anyway.  Can see the appeal for all the fans of zombie movies.  Wouldn't probably be my first choice, but might be a fun one to take out during a Halloween party or late night gaming jag when the players have all pretty much turned to zombies themselves.  Can't go wrong with 100 plastic zombies!  [Market price]

Great theme, poor rules. Gameplay is very slow, even for a zombie game. things don't really get hectic, because too few zombies move, they move slow, there can only be one zombie in a space, and you can only shoot one zombie at a time!

Improvement ideas: faster zombies, more zombies that move, better weapons, vehicles on the board that you can use, etc. You shouldn't be able to win by shooting 22 zombies.

Like so many others I really wanted to like this, but just hated it. Felt like a slog and a couple of players quit before the end.

Being a huge fan of campy horror movies, this game is another staple of mine. Who doesn't like killing zombies? And this way you've got little to no chance of dying because of it! (so long as you don't eat the miniatures or dice.)

RATING: 2
Ugh... Where do I start?

-I don't really like the theme, but even if I loved it, I probably wouldn't enjoy the game. I find theme to be extremely poorly implemented. Most bleeding example: Ok, you've died. There, go back to the beginning (which can be even an improvement to your overall position, effectively being a prize for doing badly). It's not only that the mechanic is anticlimactic, it's that it even works against the theme!

-More on that. I've been carrying this baseball bat all around town. I can only use it on the sports shop (Not sure if the example is actually in the game or not, but it's representative enough). Yeah, sure, that makes sense :what:
I realize it is supposed to be a "You actually only get the bat when you get to the sports shop", but it makes no sense you can get the card at any time and only be able to use it somewhere specifically. Wouldn't it make more sense to have a "you find something cool" card that lets you select an specific item related to the position you're in, and let you use the item whenever you want?

-The 25-zombie kills makes no sense thematically, either: "OK, I've killed 25 zombies. I'm invincible! [Well, I died twice to get to that 25-zombie mark, but that's not all that important, is it?] Fuck the fact that I'm in the middle of the city with no way out and those 5000 other zombies lurking every single street. I've won!"
I understand that rule it's there as a mean to prevent never ending games, but taking into account it also fails on that account, could have it been that bad to add "Kill 25 zombies and exit town by arriving at a tile where the road ends in the table" or something like that? At least it would make more sense...

-Final rant on theme... Zombie games are the kind of theme that screams "cooperative" to me. I can buy you're fighting to survive, though, even if it means standing over your fellow survivor's corpse (Ups, you can'd actually do that, they re-spawn :shake:), but what sense does it makes that another player, minding his business on the other end of the town can actively trump your progress?

-Strategy doesn't mean anything. This game is such a luckfest. You might as well play the Game of Goose, or Chutes and Ladders, your options are almost as limited.

-It's Slooooooooww... and annoyingly long.

Yeah, I hate this game. If I don't play it ever again, it will be too soon. And yeah, I know I bash on the theme a lot, maybe even too much. I can play not-so-thematic games just fine. I love abstracts. But I really dislike when a supposedly thematic game is actively preventing me to get into the theme.


-> Rated a 10 from 6-3-13 to 27-3-13 to support Todd Breitenstein's fight against cancer. May he rest in peace.

I really know I should hate this game. There is not much to it and most decisions are very obvious. Still it stirs some kind of pleasant feeling inside. For some unexplainable reason I find this game fun. Fighting the endless horders of Zombies and messing with other players is just plain fun. Shoot me.

Less a game in and of itself, and more a kit to make your own, hopefully worthwhile, game.  The base rules by themselves are poorly written, poorly thought out, and kind of... just... not good.  Probably not worth the cash unless you can get it for super cheap, or if you really like the components.

We had trouble playing this game as the board seemed to expand too quickly for our number of players. We had a few chuckle-worthy moments, but otherwise the board ran out of control in comparison to our ability to move our pawns. My opinion may change if I can motivate to replay with fewer players.

I really want to like this game. But there are some problems with the game, especially the length of the game which is quite random. Many games are too long and you have little control over when it ends. The quickplay rules that are downloadable from BGG helps, or at least some of them, but it is still a bit too random. I am waiting for expansion 3.5, and hope that the new cards will improve the game. Great theme though.
Edit: Yes, the 3.5 expansion adds extra weapons, and that helps somewhat, but you still really need some house rules. Try the Quick(er) rules downloadable here.

RATING: 10
I still contend that this is one of the best zombie games available.  Most zombie games are a co-op shoot em ups.  Zombie films are about surviving...from the other humans.  Zombies are an easily dispoable threat and this game captures that theme of human douchebaggery quite well.  Sure you will need to use some rule variants from expansions, but play this fast and mean...and you've got one hell of a zombie game.  

*** This is a 10 for Todd.

Uhmmm.... this one is tough to rate. A 7 for the astounding theme created by the inspirational artwork of Dave Aikins and a slew of plastic zombies. Unfortunately it receives only a 4 for the mechanics. Players are forced to rely far too much on the luck of dice and fortune of unbalanced event cards. It also suffers from too-long gameplay exasperated by too much down time. This game earns a bonus .75 for having a zombie theme.

This game is simple enough that you can explain as you go to a newcomer and they'll grasp it after two or three turns, but the strategy, decision-making and luck factors make this incredibly fun.

A really funny game for up to 6 people. I recommend downloading the "Quicker Play Rules" and use some if not all of them.

Some sick part of me really wants to like this game and get into the B-movie atmosphere.  There's just too much dice rolling and luck of the draw.  Roll to move, then roll to attack, then roll to figure out how many zombies you can move 1 space.  Plus the game is full of "take that" card play (and zombie keep-away), and the game lasts way too long.

This is the game I really, really want to like, but it's just not very good. A large part of the problem is that the game sends mixed messages - it's competetive, in that there can only be one winner, but characters cannot actively hurt each other.

Zombies is a competetive game hiding in co-operative clothing. It uses tiles to build a board (I really like this facet of the game), dice to resolve combat (players can, to a degree, control combat using counters to influence their rolls, which I like), and cards to affect themselves and the other players.  It is these cards that I dislike, as they have a strong "take that" aspect to them, and are the primary means of interacting with other players, but only in a negative fashion.

Zombies lacks consistency, and suffers from poor pacing. I don't reccomend the game, but I really wish I could.

I love this gameconcept. Zombies are great. But as a game...?

I have the first edition, there's many small things that don't make the game good. The tiles are too thin and small, the rule about playing cards doesn't satisfy, after a while there's way too many things (tokens, zombies) on the tiles. And you need lots of luck with the dice...

But, I love zombies. :)

A total bore fest with dead simple rules and loads dice rolling.  This is a completely adversarial game, which it does not attempt to hide in any way.

I love the zombie theme and this is a fun enough game. The components are good for the price, the plastic figures are nice, and the artwork on cards and tiles are good quality.  The game is brought down by the fact that the rules need a bit of tweaking but, the game is almost open ended for "house rules" and variants.  Overall, not the deepest of games, but fun to play with a couple beers, and some friends that don't hold grudges when you stab them in the back.  The expansions and user variants are what gives this game some legs.

Zombies!!! has about 15 little expansions that add new cards and new tiles to the game.  A very simple game, not much decision making.  The bulk of the fun comes from drawing event cards and seeing what you can do to your opponents.  Yet, sometimes its better to not play anything just to hurry up and get the game over.  Overall, very easy to learn but lacks depth and can be tedious at times.

This Zombie game is a blast, especially with my own rules variant! For me, what I have come up with is the definitive way to play this board game, and as you know, every player who falls in love with this game, agrees it is incomplete as it stands, and could use the editing hand to bring it up to calibre. Even then, this is simply a testament to the potential fun factor of the game. Mine now stands as uniquely fun, and if the game was actually produced under my rules version, I would have given it a 10/10. Zombie headhunting was never this fun.

I raised a zombie for Todd's cancer fight! Then I went out and got the game. It's the essential zombie apocalypse scenario with lots of room for house rules and customization. Great artwork, great with the not-a-regular-gamer crowd (especialy if they are into zombie flicks) and nicely priced too! I like it very much! It's simple and fun!

The only downside is the production wich feels kind of "cheap" compared to the competition but I see how higher production values would have raised the price.

The rating was to support Todd Breitenstein's fight against evil and as the game has grown on me since, I guess I'll leave it.

Just for the 100 zombie sculpts I would have given it a 10 anyway (1/10 zombies) ;)

Fun in the beginning, but too long for what it is. Using dice for combat is okay, but using dice for movement isn't fun. If everybody teams up against the player closest to the heliport the game drags on forever until someone gets extremely lucky with their dice and cards. 

It feels unthematic to me that the survivors are fighting each other rather than helping each other in face of a zombie apocalypse. Theme-wise, I prefer co-op or semi-co-op Zombie games.

Really more of an activity than a game which really drags at the end, as everybody plays cards to prevent the leader from reaching the helipad.

Anyway, good for some chuckles with the right group, but essentially a roll and move dice fest with a nice theme and artwork.

Not much beyond rolling,moving and praying the dice doesn't let you down when you're surrounded by zombies. Keep it in my collection (and picked up the latest edition) more for the nostalgia, given the second ed. was the game that led me to find tabletop games that weren't monopoly.

El juego es lo que es, un tiradados, pero jugando 3-4 personas es entretenido aunque en realidad sea un deambular por el mapa hasta que sale el helicóptero. Tiene su encanto (a todo el mundo le gusta tener su colección de zombies bien muerto) pero teniendo claro que estamos ante un juego que no te va a exprimir el cerebro (aunque si puede comertelo si no tienes suerte con los dados).

What can you say? You kill zombies. The game requires no strategy, the cards and events are totally random and arbitrary, and play lasts a little too long, but it's still fun to build a little city and kill zombies. 

Don't be fooled into buying more than one expansion. More is not more in this case: you will only make the game longer and less fun.

The modular map takes a large amount of table space.  Zombie population on the board never got to be a problem, either.  [Idea: move 2d4 zombies every turn, instead of 1d6.]

RATING: 2
OK, first off the summary of the game: it sucks. OK, with that out of the way, the thing that really intruiges me about the game is that it has become somthing of a cult hit at verious cons amongst hardcore wargamers (supplanting the previous and moderately less dreadul Circus Minimus). Why would these guys, all of whom play really serious games, competitive with lots of strategy &amp; tactics, get sucked into this awful train wreck of a game? I mean, I&#039;ve heard serious OCS players debate the merits of certain action cards in this game, which blows my mind. Facinating, but regardless, pass on this one.

Pésimo juego, lo único que hace que sobresalga es sus imágenes de las cartas. A mi parecer nos ofrecen más apariencia que mecánicas, a lo que se suma que el juego pueda extenderse innecesariamente largas horas en el momento en que los jugadores solo buscan molestingarse los unos a los otros con tal que nadie gane la partida. Este juego lo compre en mis inicios en este hobbie por lo que solo me guiaba por lo que vendían las tiendas sin referencia ni conocimiento previo de los juegos de mesa.

RATING: 6
It's not as rich as most of the board games I find myself yearning to play most of the time, but it's just good fun. It flows and the capacity for screwing over the other players in a playful way, while taking what they dish out, makes for a nice complementary dynamic. I don't know if Zombies!!! is what I'd call a great game, but I appreciate it very much.

Desde que tengo la app para el movil estoy viciando mucho. y me gusta un monton. la cantidad de zombies es generosa y el las putadas entre jugadores llega a ser la diferencia entre ganar y perder.

Usually I play a game three times before rating. I don't need to in order to say that this game is the worst thing I have ever played, and an absolute waste of an hour and a half spent at the game night I was at before quitting halfway through. The game can be summarized by this: roll d6. That's it. Roll to kill zombies. Roll to move zombies. Roll to move character. Get interrupted by a game-breakingly powerful card, then look at your own hand of useless cards and feel powerless. And the game is breakable: Simply running around the map and never killing anything will allow you to place the helipad and win the game. I usually will stick through bad games, but there are no redeeming qualities here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What can I say that hasn't already been said? A fun game with a fun atmosphere that actually has a fair amount of depth provided by the event cards (you find that screwing with your friends becomes one of the most entertaining aspects of the game). Not suprisingly, one of the expansion sets consists solely of new event cards. The core rules are but a page or so in length, which can definitely be refreshing once in a while. One of the best, most fun, and most entertaining games I've ever played.

Preliminary Rating after only one play. The first half was great fun, but for some reason once all city areas were on the board and most life and ammo tokens used up without anyone winning it seemed like it could drag out forever. We probably played a very wrong tactic, so I am willing to give it another try.

Not bad. Better than I thought. Played as a two player. This rating could go up with more people. The components are a bit flimsy, but the artwork is fun.

Good fun initially but we got very bogged down and the game reached a real impasse.

I managed to win with 25 zombie kills, but everyone was hoping I'd make that last roll to make sure the game ended...  will give it another go to see if it shines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not into the whole "zombie thing" so any game based on that theme will be uninteresting to me. I played one time in a group of 8-9, and the downtime between moves was horrible. Game dragged on for 4+ tedious hours. I quit before my next turn, and I even had the cards to make me the winner. Just wasn't worth sitting through another round. 

If you want a zombie-themed "beer and pretzels" game, you'll have much more fun with Zombie Dice. Same amount of fun as an entire game of Zombies!!!, but packed into 15 minutes, so it's much more enjoyable.

I rated this a '10' to try to boost its rating while Todd (the designer) was still fighting cancer, but once he passed away I reset it to what I really thought about the game.

Zombies! is a great game for a bit. I love the exploration part, but it turns into a real drug out mess at the end of the game when the helicopter appears and everybody bombs anybody nearing the helipad. Some of the user variants make it much more enjoyable though. Better co-op as well.

Light-hearted fun.  I've found it challenging to kill the 25 zombies (actually, never seen it done yet) and rather random to find the helipad.  The expansions help some by providing some other routes out.  The game seems to drag greatly near the end... you definitely need to play fast and furious.  Haven't looked into some of the variants, though this game certainly screams out for some (and I know they're out there).

Like the box says: this is a no-brainer. With the right player group, it is fun, fast and vicious. Stay away if you want to be able to plan your moves and hate to be thwarted, if you dislike a high element of luck (dice-rolling, card drawing and even unexpected vicious twists by opponents playing nasty cards on you). DO buy if you love zombie movies and less serious games.

I find it a lot of fun and even if playing it only once every few years, the rules are relearned fast enough.

I can't rate this above a 5, but the house rules mod makes this stellar? And the core game is pretty cheap and easily available on the second hand market, so if you can't afford the expensive Zombicide but feel up to checking fan forums for better rules? Get Zombies!!! You'll be set for a long time.

Rules are in some instances not very well thought out. Sometimes it is not possible to fulfill winning conditions at all. A lot of randomness. Mechanisms are simplistic and do not leave much space for creative thinking. Hardly any meaningful decision-making. Game duration too long for simplicity of the game, becomes repetitive. Lots of downtime, at least with many players.

A neat game.  
Reminded me of Betrayal at House on the Hill, with drawing random tiles.  Nice way of always keeping the growing town different and random (at least at the mercy of the player playing the tile)
It was a pretty good, every player for themselves, kind of game.  
Though it didn't hit the table too often, it was fun.
Although because I do enjoy other games more, especially ones with a cooperative aspect, it's a good game.
Other players also had some fun while playing but if we didn't schedule this game in our playing sessions, then it just was not a top pick when hitting the gaming table.

Hence the 6 rating.  Not a bad game, fun to play, but so many others that were chosen above it.

I bought this game way back when the 2nd edition dropped. I only recently started playing again after many life changes (marriage, college, kid, etc.). My feelings towards the game haven't changed much. It is a flawed but enjoyable game. 

The gripes I mainly see with this series are "it's too luck based" and "it's too simple." Both are mostly true, This is a very simple game, and much of the game is die roll and draw dependent. 

Winning/losing seems to be largely determined by the roll of the die and the luck of the draw. Except, I play with my wife, and I almost always win. It isn't due to great rolls and great draws, but rather the difference in how we play the cards we get and the decisions we make. I play aggressively, while she plays passively. This means, I take more risks, I play more "screw you" cards, I burn through cards as quickly as possible to always have access to new options, and I know which win condition to focus on given how the game is shaping up. This shows that even though it is a luck heavy game, the dice don't determine the winner/loser.

I find the game's simplicity to be more plus than a minus. Sometimes you want a hyper complicated game that requires as much mental energy and time investment as a full time job, But other times, you just want a simple, easy to set-up, quick, and enjoyable diversion... with zombies. This game is that. The simplicity issue gets fixed as you acquire more expansions, which add extra mechanics, variant ways to play, more cards, and individual player decks. 

Simplicity and the game's main flaw (vagueness) is also fixed by my favorite feature of board gaming. You are free and encouraged to tweak rules as you please. I love this. I have been playing video games my entire life and Yu-Gi-Oh (grudgingly) since it came stateside. These are fixed regulated experiences. You are at the mercy of the game, and you have no freedom to change things that don't work for you (unless you can use mods). Board games don't have this issue, and I love it. There are mechanics and cards I live and those I don't. I don't sue the stuff I don't like. I expand upon stuff I do like. Lately, we have been using the addictions and character card expansions as a base to create custom characters that fit our play. It adds to the game without changing it too much. We also use zombie animals where we see fit, like dogs or kids in town and bears in the woods. 

I would recommend this game to anyone into games, and if the enjoy it, I would recommend some of the expansions, especially 3.5 and 6 to expand the town, Deadtime Stories for lots of new content and ways to play, and later Defcon Z and the 2nd expansion to bring in a military base, infection, enhanced zombies, and more. I find the zoo and college expansions to be lackluster, but I love zombie animals, and the underutilized Guts Tokens offer a lot of great customized rule options.

RATING: 10
Leaving this a 10 permanently in honor of Todd and his family, and also to piss off you asocial, subhuman wastes of genetic material that harrumphed an out the BGG ratings and the sanctity of the Web site at a time when a prominent designer needed the support of a community he contributed quite a lot to. If it had been Uwe Rosenberg or Reiner Knizia, you stupid fuckers that complained about this wouldn't have bat an eye. The people that complained about this and got upset are an embarrassment to the hobby and I this Web site. So permanent 10, I hope others do the same to unnaturally raise this game's meaningless ranking.

>>>
Re-rating a 10 for Todd- best wishes to you and yours.

The critical dichotomy that divides this game reminds me of the opinions I heard regarding ALIEN VS. PREDATOR.  "No plot", "stupid", "made no sense", "immature", "no character development"...WHAT THE HELL DID YOU PEOPLE EXPECT FROM A MOVIE CALLED "ALIEN VS. PREDATOR"?  Likewise, those who b*t*h and whine about this being a "dicefest" or "luck-driven" obviously don't get that ZOMBIES!!! is just supposed to be stupid, nonsensical fun geared toward horror movie fans.  You play it, you crack jokes, roll dice, and it doesn't really matter who wins.  Granted, if you try to play this with the beards-and-bellies set that likes to crunch numbers over a a game of El Grande this game is torture incarnate.  Play it with players who game to have fun rather than demonstrate their intellectual superiority via complex long term strategies and it's definitely an 8.  Plus it's fairly receptive to house rules, which cna really add to the good times.

RATING: 6
A fun game to pull out once a year in October or if you're really in a zombie killing mood. I only play this with a house rule allowing players to play 1 card during each players turn (rather than once per round). Keeps people much more active between turns and allows for more backstabbing. The game can get drawn out however as people try to prevent the leader from killing their final zombie.

RATING: 6
As written, the rules aren't the greatest. The tile artwork can be confusing with certain buildings, and the map doesn't expand fast enough at the beginning of the game. However, we've added a few house rules and changed up the arbitrary card system to give it more clarity (when you enter a building, you can get the item from the building, etc.). 

In short, we changed the rules to make it more fun and thematic. At times, it really feels like you are in a hopeless situation, utterly surrounded by zed.

This game has tiles and is modular, but doesn't have that "dungeon crawl" feeling that I thought it might.  Good!  SO simple, but I like the zombie theme.  I will keep this game and it will come out as needed.  HIGHly customizeable.  Very conducive to house rules.  Great game for Halloween night, when the trick-or-treaters keep pausing the game.
Played using the board from Electronic Mall Madness = AWESOME!
Thank you Todd.

I have to admit that this game was much funner than I thought it would be. With the right people for this kind of game it can be a blast. I probably wouldn't rate it higher than a 6, despite its fun, for a couple of reasons however. First off it is way WAY too long for the type of game it is. Our game with 4 people lasted over 3 hours. This is not a deep enough game to sit for 3 hours for. It was fun enough that nobody wanted to actually quit, but still a bit tedious. Also, there is not enough of a strategy element to it. Its a lot of die rolling, and the rest of the game is basically trying to screw over everybody else more then they can screw you over. As I said, with the right people, this can be quite fun. I had the right people for my first game, and as a result I would be happy to play it again on occasions. (minus about 2hours of playing time of course)

You can pretty much throw any strategy out the window when the helicopter pad tile shows up. After that it becomes a luck of the dice rolling race to the helicopter pad. It doesn't matter if you die because you just re-spawn. Die, re-spawn, race to the helicopter pad. Die, re-spawn, race to the helicopter pad. Die, re-spawn, race to the helicopter pad. You get the idea.

I had high hopes for this game after reading the rules (and discovering one of the "faster" variants).  But the first game I played was not great.  I find it hard to see the town pieces, and it felt like we spent half the game just placing little zombies on the board and accidentally knocking them over and having to pick them back up again.

Fun to play! We always have a blast playing it, and have had some hilarious moments, especially when people are going for the win. Expansion 6 is a must buy for me because the subways allow for much quicker movement towards the end which stops the game from becoming too slow late on which is the biggest issue with the base game. Great value for money as a 4+ player game, best at the end of a game night after a few beers I think. Especially if people get into the game!

con las reglas originales, repetitivo, aburrido y se puede hacer muy largo sin aportar diversion. muy desbalanceado y poco interes en diseñar el juego.

con reglas caseras se logra un juego interesante, sobre todo si un player maneja los zombies, se banen o modifican algunas cartas y se modifica la colocacion de losetas.
para reglas custom si o si.

Bought after playing it again for the first time in years. I'm a big fan of zombie games and movies, hence my higher rating than most.

RATING: 5.3
This game is worth a few laughs, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost to own it.  Players maneuver around a modular board, trying to slay 25 zombies, or make it to the helicopter, whichever comes first.  A simple roll of 4 or better on a die defeats a zombie.  The luck of the die and the attempts to push your luck by attacking "just one more" zombie leads to some amusing moments.

But there are several negatives.  First, the bullet and heart tokens are tiny, and hard to pick up off the tiles (which are themselves very thin).  Secondly, it's hard to move anywhere on the board quickly, making the potential strategy of going to pick up a key weapon you have listed on a card very difficult.  As you slog through to move just a couple boards, boards are added with still more zombies at an alarming rate.

This isn't a bad game, but it's just not the game for me - I'd rather play Last Night on Earth.

RATING: 3
A theoretically infinite play time (and in practise far too long - by the end of the game I played everyone pretty much wanted it over regardless of who won).

Few tactics - mainly chance based.

Unsuccessful at provoking fear or any real narrative.

Essentially a lightweight 'filler-type' game that goes on way too long.

THis game has alot of potential, but it just needs more work. I love the aspect of exploring the city, but there isn't much point in doing so because you will inevitably end up on the opposite side of town from the helicopter pad. And that is just annoying.

Picked this up at B&N while visiting Sheila in Greensboro and it started this whole obsessive game collection.

Out of the box, the game isn't much fun at all:  No one ever wants to go into any buildings (it's too easy to die), it sucks if you keep rolling poorly (especially for movement), and it's a waste of time placing tiles/zombies on every player's turn (since no one will ever even go to half of those tiles).

Still, a few house rules can make the game a lot better:  Only draw a new tile when you move near an edge, create custom characters that have set movement amounts and special skills, let weapon cards be used in any building, etc.

This is an OK game that may be leaving my collection soon.  I like the tile laying mechanic along with each player controlling zombies each turn.  My main complaint is that it always ends up being an unnecessarily long game, especially since there are so many cards that give players the ability to prolong the ending by thwarting any "near victory" players plans.  The end game always ends up being just a race to the heliport with repeated "send back to start point" cards played along the way.  I would like it more except for that fact - it's too easy to make this game last far too long.

This was the first Twilight Creations game I played.  It was tedious, but I have been told that the expansions have upgraded the game play.

In einer Zombie-verseuchten Stadt muss man sich bis zum Ausgang durchkämpfen. Durch sehr einfache Regeln sehr unkompliziert und gute Horror-Trash Atmosphäre. Man sollte sich nur eine Hausregel überlegen um die Spielzeit niedrig zu halten, dann wird der durchaus vorhandene Spaßfaktor nicht überstrapaziert. Ansonsten gibt es viele Partien, die nie zum Ende kommen, weil der gerade führende Spieler von allen anderen mit fiesen Aktionskarten bombardiert wird und dadurch wieder stark zurückgeworfen wird.

Good theme and good bits - the game is just a couple of rules away from being very good. I think it would benefit from a scenario type set-up, rather than a random generation of the tiles. Also perhaps something to remove the 'take that' element from the game and replace with a more cooperative (but still competitive) light role playing feel. I must trawl the available variants on bgg at some point to see if someone has already produced something like this - no need to now, Zombicide is the way to go.

I have never sold a game that I own before, but if/when I do, I will probably try to get rid of this one first.  

It takes way too long to play, there are almost no key decisions that you have to make, the board is constantly getting moved around due to the cheap nature of the board components and most of the game is spent moving zombies back and forth as you try to box in your opponent and they subsequently try to move them away so they can move.

It's one of those games you play when you first learn about board gaming, think it's amazing...and a few years later after you learn and play other games, realize that it really wasn't that good to begin with.

I went in with low expectations for this game but was pleasantly surprised.  It does has a few problems...Whoever draws the helipad has a big advantage.  Also, the zombie collection win is difficult to pull off.  This can reduce the game to positioning for the helipad.  But it still a fun 2er game if you like a good dice-rolling game.  Not suure how well it will scale up for more players.

RATING: 10
This game is rated a 10 in honor of its designer, Todd Breitenstein, who lost his fight with cancer in 2013.  Although I am not particularly fond of the game itself (I would probably rate it at 5 or 6 in any other circumstance), this game will forever remain a 10, as well as a part of my revolving game collection, in his honor.  There are some things that are simply more important than any supposed "sanctity" of game ratings, and the fight against cancer is one of those things.  RIP, Todd, and know that you are not and shall never be forgotten.

I've played this game twice, with different groups of people, and both times it ended with long-time close friends yelling at each other in anger. This game brings out the worst in people.

It's a dice-fest, and one bad roll can put you in a hopeless situation that just has you praying for the game to end.

Unfortunately, at the same time, someone else is having a great time and thinks it's a hoot. So each time he places new zombies onto the board, he places them in a way that is going to prolong the suffering of playing the game, even though there are other players begging -- PLEADING -- with him to just put everyone out of their misery.

Don't play this game with anyone you actually like.

There's not much strategy here at all, and the cards are very much in the "take that!" category, but the theme is fun.  Goes on a bit too long and doesn't have the best replayability.

Zombies may suffer from some problems (such as rolling a die for movement) but when all is said and done, it's still good fun, if it doesn't go on too long. 
Witnessing a game unfold is like watching a movie, with subplots and missions unfolding, succeeding or failing, and new goals popping up... with players often working to achieve very different goals in very different ways. 

Plays  better with the expansions. 

I agree with others assessments that the game can go  on too long. There are numerous variants online (including here at BGG) that correct this problem. My rating reflects my opinions of the game "as is", out of the box with rules as written. If you get any one expansion, my recommendation would be the 3.5 cards expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Can be fun with a lively crowd who enjoys the theme, but there isnt much to this game except repeatedly 1) moving your figure a space, and 2) rolling a die to shoot at a zombie in your path.  Playing cards on other players mostly just lengthens the game.  Ridiculously overlong with rules as published.  Could rank higher with variant rules, but never really tried.

When playing this game, I feel like a zombie myself. With the default rules, playing with 5 players, you're just waiting for the last tile to show up. Then it's only a race to the helipad. The alternate victory condition is impossible to achieve with 4  players, so the penalty for dying becomes moot. The event cards are for the most part useless or have a negligible impact on the game. Bleh.

Check out also my comment on Midevil.

Lots of luck, random in this game, boring. A game can last a couple of hours. Especially with 6 players. Might consider playing again with fewer players. You do the same thing in every turn. Not a lot different possibilities.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I don't plan to play Zombies!!! any time soon.

The theme is amusing, but the gameplay tends to drag on. If all the items on the map run out, it turns into endless attempts to run from the respawn point to the end, killing a few zombies along the way. Who wins is a fairly random matter.

Nonetheless, the play can be fun in the right atmosphere. Usually, though, I'd rather play a heavier game - or a less dragged out light game.

I don't get what the fuss is about this game.  Seems to be broken in many ways;  You don't often interact with other players; Room-based action cards are pretty useless (chances are you won't be anywhere near that room and it isn't usually worth it to go there).

The best beer and pretzel game ever. The rules are simple and you can be playing this game in a matter of minutes. Playing with two is ok but the game really shines when a third person is added. It is all about stabbing your friends in the back. At one point we had two tiles to go to get to the helipad and everyone started in with the 'we're screwed!' and 'bad sense of direction' cards(play the game and you'll know what I mean). It took an hour just to get past those two tiles to win. What an hour that was though, we never laughed so hard during a game session. It may have some faults but it is too much fun to pass up. Buy it.

A mí me pareció un juego con mucho azar, mucho puteo (esto le sube puntos) y una mecánica que no me parece para nada pulida. Mucho muñequito y poca consistencia. Ideal para hinchar las bolas un rato. Aunque para eso, a priori, prefiero cualquier cosa menos este juego; y para juego tengo varios que me motivan infinitamente más. Si lo desempolvo alguno de estos días será para variar. Quizás me sorprenda gratamente. Pero lo dudo.

Pretty much the epitome of a "beer & pretzels" game. Not much strategy or anything you really need to pay attention to.  Grab some items and roll some dice. It's cool to have lots of zombies on the table and to fight through them, but the straightforwardness of it feels a little dated and doesn't have as much appeal as it once did.

RATING: 5
This game is special because it renewed my interest in board games after my highschool/college days of playing Axis & Allies and Samurai Swords.  I thought it looked cool at a local hobby shop, and because of my purchase there, I was eventually led to BGG.

This is a take-that, player-screwage, type of game set in a zombie apocalypse.  Players explore a zombie infested city, flipping over one city tile at a time on their turn.  While doing so, players kill zombies and collect health and ammunition.  Players utilize cards to either give themselves benefits/equipment or use them on opponents to screw them over.  

The mayhem truly begins when the helicopter pad tile is drawn and everyone makes a mad dash to be the first player there.  Ultimately, there are no friends in Zombies!!!

The game is a little rough in the rules department and plays a bit long for what it is.  However, there is a lot of room for house-ruling and creating your own scenarios.  There aren't many deep decisions to be made and it is highly luck-dependent.  It's ok for what it is.

fun, no-brainer game.  The Zombie minis are fun and the game does a good job of making the players feel as if they are exploring and escaping from a real town full of zombies.  Zombies suffers from a couple of things.  First, it can be a long slog lasting several hours.  Second, there is limited strategy.  You can either run for the helicopter pad full of zombies as fast as your little plastic legs can carry you, hold back and let someone else attempt to plow through the zombies hoping they die in the attempt or ignore he helicopter altogether and attempt to collect the 25 zombies needed to win the game outright.

Hateful, really. It's a shame, because it's a great theme & the components & cards are excellent & genuinely funny. 

I have a house rule whereby each player rolls a die at the start of the game, with ties being re-rolled. The player who rolls the highest is declared the winner.

This has the same net effect, and frees a couple of hours for you all to do something remotely useful and/or interesting.

This game is good for a laugh. I couldn't play it every weekend, but getting together with friends for a zombie apocalypse once in a while is a good use of an evening. The miniatures and game concept are cool, and there are numerous revisions and homerules for spicing it up a bit.

The expansions are a bit meh, and only really add new map tiles and some interesting cards.

(As of [b]1+[/b] plays) A zombie survival crawl with about as much vitality as the undead horde it features. Gameplay is repetitive and interminable, easily lasting a full hour longer than it should, with no meaningful decisions or strategy. Extensive house rules can salvage something playable from the wreckage, but played "as published", this is a loser. 

[b]10 year verdict:[/b] One of the first games I bought in college. It served its purpose (giving me and two other geeks stuck on campus something to do before the semester started) but after that, it has been nothing but an overproduced millstone around my collection's neck. I was thrilled to trade it away.

This could be a fun game, but I'm never satisfied with the version of the rules my friends and I are using. I don't like continually respawning when you die because it takes any tension away in the game and also makes the game last for forever. We tried using rules in which death is permanent, but the scarcity of resources makes it a little too tough.

A great game that is always fun to break out.  Games can sometimes take a while and other times take next to no time to complete.  It is best to plan for long games and be surprised when they end quickly than to expect a short game and have it drag on.  The expansions only add more to the game and make it completely customizable by which ones you add in to the chaos.

This game is terrible. It is awful.

Do you know how sometimes you have that one friend who likes eating a weird food, and everyones like "ew, how can you eat that? it is so WEIRD!", but then you're all "Hey man, eat whatevs you want, we've all got different tastes."  And its true.  You like what you like and I like what I like and there's  no problemo.  And then some other guy who likes to eat the feet of orphans is all like "I like to eat the feet of orphans!"  And then you citizens arrest his ass, and he's all whiny "But I thought you said I could like whatever I wanted and it's cool cause we all have different tastes." and it is then you realize that some things just aren't okay to like...

This game is one of those things it is not okay to like.

I've heard the second edition adds some better artwork to the simple tiles that come with my version, i think that the actual basic game is a little mediocre.

Zombies is a breezy but cutthroat little kill-fest that doesn't really turn fun until late in the game, when the encroaching zombie mob is difficult to avoid.  The event cards are wildly unbalanced (if you can hold on to the 'move 10 spaces' card, you pretty much win), and sometimes placing all the life and ammo tokens on new tiles is irritating, but the basic game play is fun, in the right group.  Also, for such a light game, Zombies takes up a *lot* of space on a table.

This game is so pointless it's almost fun. When my group played, we turned it in to a co-op towards the end. Why would humans be competing like this in a Zombie Apocalypse? And why are you making your way to a HELICOPTER? Where are you going to go?? It's the APOCALYPSE! And by the way, when you were running through the city, what was the pilot of the helicopter doing? Reading the paper? Why can't he land on any building? There's no rules any more, there's no society! Random combat with the zombies, poor production (the brains/bullits are very hard to pick up). Nonsense.

I've actually dropped this a notch from 7 to 6. I think there's a tipping point where the game starts to drag, and everyone just wants it to be over.

This game could easily be fixed majorly by allowing you to play as many cards as you wanted from your hand as opposed to 1 per entire round. Thus ensuring everyone holds on to their cards for dear life until someone is about to win then they pig pile on him. The playtime is WAYYYYYYY to long for what you get out of it.

Pretty uninspiring game with a lot of randomness.  I played with two players, and I could see it becoming a bit more chaotic fun with more people, but also dragging out MUCH longer, which could make it tedious.  Since I picked it up for $10 at a Barnes & Noble clearance sale, it's not a big loss, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the game.

(2-6 players) I've been an apologist for this game, but no more. Great components and theme but it suffers from horribly tedious mechanics (roll, roll, roll your dice).

Now I just need to figure out how to incorporate the zombie figures into other games.

I gave this away to a friend who wanted it.
Honestly!
They wanted it.
I didn't force it upon them! *cough*

This game is too brutal to be any fun, even if you manage to collect all the health and ammo you need you better not actually run into more than 1 or 2 zombies at a time otherwise you will fail a roll and die horribly, problem is the zombies tend to clump together and with a variable game length (keep going until you find helicopter pad) this can drag on for a while without you actually achieving anything.

And if dragging on endlessly wasn't fun enough for you your fellow players can and are actively encouraged to nobble you just because.
YAY! *waves tiny flag*

An incredibly basic combat basic game, with not a lot going for it, except for lots and lots of zombies, a cool tile laying system of building the city, some disgusting yet awesome artwork, and a bunch of neat expansions.

If played with the proposed "Quick Play" rules found on the Geek, goes up to a 6, maybe. Pretty fun with a bunch of gamers. I wouldn't play with the expansions - it just makes the game longer, and it already is a bit too long. *** UPDATE: Okay, maybe not. This is a 5, but by all rights it should be a 4 despite the quick play rules. They needed to keep this in development for a little longer, and made it more interesting by giving players more meaning ful decisions to go with the platic zombies. *** UPDATE: Ok, it IS a 4. Not playing this again if I can help it.

RATING: 9
I love zombies, tile based board games, and screwing over other players...this game was made for me. The only things keeping it from a 10 is that the game can run a litte long and some of the players I play with tend to lose intrest or become somewhat frustrated and pissy near the end of the game. Aside from that though, this is a great, simple game with a great theme, incredible artwork, and the rules are easily modified to provide the type of game you&#039;re looking for. And you just can&#039;t beat 100 plastic zombies. I love this game!

The first game that I bought, as myself and a mate were curious about it at the time. It's okay... maybe it's better with the expansions? But I've never really liked it enough to invest more money into it to find out.

RATING: 5
Not really a 10.  But supporting the designer is important.

Very fun with cards that really add to the theme but too often gets bogged down with repeated "do overs" after players die or send each other back to start with one of the cards.

This was a gift, and it's pretty good. It can be overlong and repetitive, but it's also very simple and accessible. I play it with my family sometimes and try to make it as enjoyable as possible - which means I don't play too competitively and try to make everyone's experience go smoothly. If played cutthroat style it gets long and frustrating.

Roll and move plus a coin flip combat mechanic are the ingredients for a game that offers no relevant decisions and seems to last forever. And as if that wasn't enough the only way to screw other players is to slow them down even more. I'd recommend doing away with all the bling (board, figures, cards) and just rolling dice. Most 4s+ wins.

classic its basically an arcade type zombie game. not complex like zombicide  so its really easy to teach to new people, and its got tons of expansion and each one adds tons to the base game giving new victory conditions and weapons and enemies without overcomplicating the game. I have 2 copies of this game along with a bunch of expansion so this is an extra trade copy. Its basically like arkham horror, one of those games that everyone should play at some time.

A rather basic zombie fighting game with some good miniatures for the cost of the game. Just not a lot of depth on what's going on in the game it would have been easy in the core box to have some different cards for scenarios to add a bit of variety. Good for a in-between game or to introduce people to zombie games.

RIP, Todd.


Brraaainnns....a simple game, given bonus points for the atmosphere...and *100 FRIGGIN' ZOMBIES!*

For a small publisher, this is certainly a great production.  You open the box and are immediately greeted with the little 100 plastic zombies.  The tiles are a decent thickness, the cards seem to handle wear well.

It's a roll and move affair with some cardplay, exploring the town, just trying to survive until the helipad turns up.  It's certainly thematic, but the rules are a bit rough, like it needs a bit more "there, there" for the length it takes to play.



EDIT:  This game needs house rules to help with bad endgame.  You think the end's in sight when the helipad comes up, but then whoa nelly does the cardplay come fast and furious.  Suddenly, everyone in town forgot to tie their shoelaces, or slipped, or hurt their leg, and of course the mad zombie congo line begins in earnest.

I dig this game, it just needs...help.

Pretty good, but not that good.

Who cant love the name and the classic cheesey zombie film style of the game. I was intrigued by the game and loved the concept, but the game itself left me feeling a bit empty. The game is repetitive. Killing zombie after zombie, action card, then moving to kill more zombies. I mean the game is a great idea, but it was just designed in a way that was monotonous and sorta boring. Don't get me wrong, the game concept was brillant, but the game just in the end simply wasn't fun enough to fufill a full sixty minute game.

I've now played this game three time with my kids and it gets better every time. It's been great for building confidence with simple skills like orientation, counting, and simple math.

Not the best game in the world, and it tends to drag. Once in a while it's all right, but I wouldn't tell anyone to run out and buy it.

I myself have a fetish for zombies, so, naturally, I gravitated toward this title. Once the Lady and I tried it about four times, and only actually finished it once, it remained on the shelf gathering dust. So, I traded it away.

Definitely a beer and pretzels game...if you have nothing else to play....

Really wanted to like this, but just couldn't. It was slow and boring. By the time we drew the helipad tile, we just wanted the game to end. We played with cooperative rules and are willing to try it again with more players and with the competitive rules, but I really don't see our opinions changing on this one.

Where do I begin with "Zombies!!!"?

I was introduced to Z!!! by a friend of mine many years ago. We played it hoping for an awesome Zombie game, what we got... was more than we bargained for.

Basically we played with 6 people, loved it, and even still to this day talk about how awesome it was. 

Now that I've moved away from those friends, I told myself I would buy Zombies!!! for myself, which I did.

Then I found out how many expansions there were for them!

Malls, Military Bases, Woods, Schools?? What!

So this game, is just fantastic. Build a city, collect items, battle your way through zombies, get to the chopper, win?

Such an easy game to learn, and so fun. It can be quick, or take the entire night to play.

And I can't wait to play it with expansions!

Not a bad game.  Easy to learn, not hard to pick up. Did not go too long.  Players can get knocked out easy, but we were using a variant that lets them "respawn", so I think that would be the best version to play.

My kids are OK with the subject matter (as they are used to seeing zombies running around in Scooby Doo!), but the action cards supplied with the game are in my judgement too gory for my 8 year old.

One might ask why all the expansions considering my low ranking. I guess that once I started buying the expansions I was caught up in the inertia and didn't come to a full stop until #7. Still find myself picking up #8 once in a while at the FLGS and have to remind myself that I am unlikely to ever play it before I can break the spell and put it down. I think I've only ever played the base game, Mall Walkers, and Schools Out. If I am not mistaken I have also purchased that bag o extra zombies. (I really do want those damn clowns tho! If you are a betting person, put 10$ on me eventually buying it before the end of 2010.)

edit: yep, bought #8. Now just need the bag o clowns.

Jorge (Regalo de 2015, con practicamente todas las expansiones)

Lo considero un juego tematico bastante bueno, adecuado para introducirse en el "mundillo". no complejo de reglas, una buena ambientacion y el original metodo de construccion del mapa son sus mejores bazas. 

Hoy dia se considera ya superado (principalmente por zombicide o por huida de silver city, segun a quien preguntes). Pero aunque evidentemente en presentacion y materiales por ejemplo frente a zombicide no tiene nada que hacer, por contra opino que en mecanica de juego y desarrollo de la accion en algunos aspectos zombies!!! es mejor. 

un buen juego para "la tarde del domingo"

I've really enjoyed this every time I've played and it's poor overall score surprises me. However, I've not got to play it too often, so maybe my enthusiasm will wane. There's a childish joy in the manner you can foil your opponents, and the tile-laying nature of the game - and the two ways to win - takes it above Munchkin. However, it does suffer the same endgame issue as Munchkin, where it can drag on longer than anyone would like - something I will get round to doing a house rule for at some point. Probably something as simple as once the helipad comes out, all 'move back' and 'place x zombies' cards can only be played once more before going out of the game entirely.

I will always love it, since it was one of the games that brought me into boardgames in my early twenties! But the game it self is really not that fantastic. However, with the right group, and a couple of beers, this is a great "take that"- game! Butterfingers! 

Update: I recently taught this game to people at a small Zombie Con, and it was fantastic! Families, teenagers, grandparents, everybody loved it!

I was going for 5, but... It's fast, simple, stupid, FUNNY SHIT HAPPENS with the action cards. I can play it with the kids or as a drinking game. Anybody can learn (and master) it in a minute, setup doesn't take forever and the game takes a very reasonable time.

Don't expect immersion or heavy replay value, but as I said, the action cards spell out a funny story every now and then. I've been looking for the follow-up a long time, it's never in stock when I'm in a store :-)

This game can suffer from the "gang up on the leader" mentality all-to-common common in a number of other games of this genre.  I would highly recommend that you consider tweaking the victory conditions based on the number of players, possibly removing some of the city tiles, lowering the kill count, etc.

Uniquely among my ratings, this games score is based on the fun it has given me, rather than actually how good it is. This used to be a regular, psst midnight, end of night mess around. Hrs and hrs of play time notched up. Just roll the dice and do one on your mate, as you head for the heli. Have burned out on this now and moved on.
If you don't like to play for fun, or don't see the joy in fucking your buds over for shits and giggles. Think winning is the most important part of game nite, or are looking for some mathematical analysis puzzle etc, you had better go elsewhere. 
Contrary to popular belief the rules are harmless, its supposed to be simple and silly. Who cares if the ending is broken for some, it's all about the alcohol fuelled zombie slaying ride!

Also own the expansions:

2 & 
6

6 is very good. It can be used to eliminate the end game: isolated with no chance 'issue'. 
I personally think you should have just killed more zombies or accept that some shotgun guys are doomed to die. But hey, its all good!

Broke this out with the children, only out of curiosity. The rules are simple enough I thought. So gave it a go. They loved it, we laughed all the way. Looks like the old game has new legs. Will make up a few children friendly decks, for our next session. Grr arrgh!

I really, REALLY wanted to like this game.But alas, it was not to be.The trash taking and the special cards are fun, as is the discovery factor.  But add in the sloooow pace, and those wear thin quickly.  If you make the players more powerful or give them more movement, the game moves quicker for a while, but still slows at the end.  The game still took 2.5 hours (with 6 people) and the gameplay just wasn't enough to sustain interest past 1.5 hours.The end game is INTERMINABLE, and collecting zombies to win just makes no sense.  There has got to be a better way to finish the game.  Even the variants I've seen only increase the players' powers and allow for zombifying dead players.  Something is awry...and I'm not sure what.  Somebody fix this (end)game!

Zombies!!! has awesome miniatures, and tons of them. It has a board full of houses, and has you play a survivor trying desparately to outgun and outrun the slow-moving menacing evil clawy bity zombies.

But, the mechanics are sluggish, the cards are so situational that many of them become barely playable, things in general are unbalanced with some stuff being really powerful and other stuff being really weak.

I'd much rather play Last Night on Earth.

It's an extremely annoying and disappointing game if you play this game with players without tactics and your survival can be totally ruined when somebody plays poorly.(Plus, you can do nothing about it.) Some cards are too powerful, it's actually the others who control your character. If you're the target, you're screwed. If not, you may have a chance to control a little bit more of your character if luck is on your side. The game starts ok with everybody searching for the cockpit, but the ending sucks because of the game play. I don't see a reason spending time playing a game when you can hardly decide anything significant for your own character.

   This game is really fun, especially when you have enough players. Despite the simplicity of the game, there is plenty of player interaction and quite a few decisions to be made.
    My one complaint is that there is a certain threshold where a player gets enough heart tokens / bullets and they are essentially unstoppable, no matter how many zombies you through at them. If the game gets out of that equilibrium zone, it isn't so fun, but otherwise it's a blast. Besides, it IS a game about zombies!!!!

This game seems good on the surface, but after playing a few games you see it's rich on flavor, and light on everything else.

Great brain eating fun. Some of the cards are bah-roken and silly, so I play without them. Run around staying alive until the resue helicopter arrives. I love the modular board, and gameplay is funny as well, but the endgame is a foul mess, and detracts from the enjoyability of the game.

GAMEPLAY
A zombie thrashing game with simple roll and move turns and gotcha card playing. The goal of the game is to kill 25 zombies or reach the helicopter and live to tell the tale. The city is built each player turn as they are randomly laid from the stack. Each player takes it in turn to roll for movement fighting zombies along the way. Play cards with weapons on them to more effectively kill zombies or move faster. Other players play cards to add more zombies in your way. This game is a blast to play as you get stuck by your opponents. Unfortunately also because of this the game can drag on quite a long time. There are some house rules to help (check out the strategies).
COMPONENTS
The art is a generic modern city setting of good quality. The cards used for the city are too thin and need some back bending to flatten. Thicker stock would also help prevent the board shifting during gameplay. The models are about 15mm, there is a shotgun toting hero of six different colors and a bag full of zombies. You can and should augment your collection with a second bag purchased separately which will help for bigger games.
THEME
Everyone loves zombies! The simple mechanics and the unexpected twists and turns of the cards makes the game feel very cinematic and full of story. Brains…..
WHO IS IT FOR?
This is not a very deep game, with lots of dice rolling luck. That and the gotcha cards its hard to plan, there is chaos abound. Its tricky to recommend an age because of the subject matter, the game’s length is more of a factor try 12 and up. Games can be as short as 90 minutes but they can go on much longer.

This rates a 5 played with the rules as written out of the box.  With the proper amount of house-rule spackle this can climb as high as a 7 or even an 8 with the right music, mood and people.

How much spackle?  [i]All of it.[/i]  You'll want to come up with new rules for movement, combat, endgame and victory conditions, using any combination of your own tasty brains, the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/3063]Quick(er) Play Rules[/url], [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/Yugblad]Yugblad's[/url] suggestions:

[q=Yugblad]1. Throw out the rulebook.
2. Pick and choose from the variant rules on the Geek - remember to keep it SIMPLE!
3. Do not lay down tiles after finding the helipad.
4. Forget counting "dead" zombies for the winner - this is a kill-the-zombie-to-escape game. Let the most bloodthirst player place the helipad.
5. When a player dies, have him/her/them control the zombies, etc.
6. Trim the card deck to a custom-picked 50-60 cards. NO more, no less. Keep it 50/50 to screwage/benefit cards.
7. Use a timer - this keeps a panicky atmosphere ticking over.
8. Mount the town tiles on 2mm-thick card.
9. Use the subway expansion.[/q]
and the smorgasbord of rules salad on the Twilight Creations website.

I have to admit that I was very put off by this at first—if I wanted to make my own game I would have made my own game, not spent money on an unfinished product.  With time, however, I've very much warmed to the idea of [i]Zombies!!![/i] as a sandbox/toolkit experience game, a gaming hot rod that can be fiddled with and tuned until you get the custom ride that perfectly suits you & your game group.

If you dig the theme, have the time and are so inclined to tinker, this is pretty darn good.

:zombie:

My set-up:

[GAMEID=23972]
[GAMEID=31464]: glow-in-the-dark zombies, cards & tiles
[GAMEID=20494]: Guts tokens & cards
[GAMEID=28734]: Sewer tokens, cards & 3x subway tiles

Great fun - lots of mass zombie murder. Either kill 25 by normal rules.. or... GET TO DA CHOPPA!

My girls love to play this primarily because of the theme.  The game is very shallow and, as my daughter says, "feels loose".  I agree with her.  This game is repititve and after the second or third play becomes pretty boring.  The artwork on the cards is hilarious, however, and adds entertainment.  Not a well designed game but fun the first couple of times you play it.  The bigger the group the better.

One of my first non-standard board games. It can be a bit aggressive so we end up playing it more co-operatively (while still raining zombies down on one another). I think of it as a cardboard videogame, old-school 8-bit with thin plot and mechanics. This game isn't deep and it takes too long to play; it isn't meaty enough. And it's ultimately luck-based, so it feels mindless. It used to at least get pulled out at Halloween but there are much better, similarly themed games for that now ("Dead of Winter" anyone?)

this is a bad game. it really would be a 2 normally, only the nice components push it to a (not very solid) 3. by all means: AVOID laying this game without the fast-play rules. otherwise you will be mindless like a zombie at the end of the 3-hour-or-so-of-absolutely-senseless-dicerolling. as soon as the game starts i always find myself wishing somebody win this game QUICK to make it end. even with fast-play rules. without them i would probably not survive it.buy the zombies and play some of the other zombie games free on the net. everythings better than this game. really.

Blarg. . . is what I have to say about this game.  Its amusing watching the zombie swarms grow as you place tiles when you first play it but then you realize that after the last tile is placed its torturous route to the helipad against an endless supply of zombies or getting 25 kills which is just as impossible with the "lose half your zombies" rule.  The only thing going through your head after a while is "PLEASE!! Let someone win. . . Don't die, don't die, don't die. . . ."  Too long for a game that lacks any complex strategies.

This is the game that never ends, It goes on and on my friends. Some people started playing it not knowing what it was...And, just so we are clear, it is very repetitive. Great bits though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Goofy fun with zombie hordes.  House rule allows as many zombies to be placed in a single square as can fit, makes it much more dangerous (no limit on number of health tokens you can retain to compensate for this).  Re-playability for this has taken a nose dive because of how repetitive it can be, but it's light soft fluff I can still enjoy for the speed & simplicity of non-cooperative play that I don't find in bigger co-op zombie games like Zombicide or Last Night on Earth (or for that matter any of the Cthulhu board games). 

Have Zombie Corps(e) and 100 extra glow in the dark zombie figurines.

Please, forgive my mediocre rating and don't let it dissuade you.  This game was really fun for a while once we fixed the movement problem and sped it all up.

And finally, now, refuse to play it altogether.  This was fun once, honest!  And if your friends don't go all one-track-zombie-mind on your games collection, may continue to be for years to come!

Not enough in this game for me, even if the theme is cool and you get 100 zombie minis. Maybe it will be better with some of the add ons, but I doubt it since they add cards and locations and one of the problems with game (IMO) was that you were never in the right spot to play your card (some cards require that you are, say, in the Sporting Goods Store). More cards would only reduce the chances of you being in the right spot with the right card.

Awesome Game! One of my favorites. I've played all the way through several times. The humor is great, playability is fantastic, and the competition between players continually spices it up. My only beef is that if you play by the rules, 25 kills or the helipad, it goes to quickly, and if you play both, house rules, then it tends to take quite a while. So close to a perfect game IMO.

Decent game for starters. If you are looking for a cheap zombie game this will work, but nothing in this game has lasting appeal. Bad dice rolls will knock you out of the game and not much strategy to keep you coming back. Good art and a good amount of minis for the price. Last Night on Earth and Zombicide do what this game does much better, only advantage this would have over them is the price.

We've had a lot of fun playing this one.  Bad rolls can make the game tough (bad attack roles) or boring (bad movement roles) but there are a lot of "unofficial" rules to mitigate.  

[b]Something important that many don't seem to understand about this game[/b]: it is not about the players versus the horde of zombies, but rather the players versus each other... The zombies are just the death fodder you throw at each other.  

We've never had a problem with game length but have only ever played with 3 people and use a few house rules.

If someone were to look at my game shelf and ask to play this, I'd suggest we play [GameID=7514] instead as it's probably more along the lines of what they're looking for.

Okay, 'as is', the game is a little futzy... download the 'fastplay' rules off the geek and I really enjoy it.  The pace quickens, some of the needless tiles are tossed out, and things seem to work more smoothly..It's a 'theme' game for sure.

Zombies is to board games what hack-and-slash dungeons are to role-playing games.  We found that there were some ambiguities in the rules the way we read them.  Update: Increased rating from 6 to 10 to join in the effort to support the designer as he fights cancer. Update: rating returned to normal.

Brainless.  Roll to move, roll to fight.  But it's a fun diversion, and can be quite exciting depending on what variants or house rules you're using.

While I thought the game was fine, I am definitely against cancer.  Good luck to those who are suffering from this dreaded disease.

Inital Rating: 8.0 (January 2011)

Zombies!!! Was one of the first zombies` game I ever bought and played (I have 3 unplayed expansions for this). I love that it comes with many miniatures, however the gameplay lacks in many ways. It has a ton of luck, almost no strategy and the “attack the leader” effect guarantees that the game will take a long playtime.  

On the good side the game components are pretty cool.

I believe there are a lot of good variants that can be played with this marvelous components. Still I don’t want to get rid of my copy, in fact I still want to buy all the expansions! But this is not a good game by itself. I want to play it once every two years.

Current Rating: 4.0

I finally played Zombies!!! Again and i would rate it higher if the playtime wasn’t so long for what the game offers. I think I have finally moved on so I can get rid of my copy of the game, it saddens me a bit to sell it because I really dig the miniatures, however the heart and bullet tokens are very regular but I really like the art.

I’m not sure if I want to try the unplayed expansions, we will see what happens but, either way, Zombies!!! is in its way out of my game collection, now it is just a matter of time.

Eric.  A great idea flawed by a bad game.  Its too long and imbalanced.  It starts off fun for maybe the first 1-1.5 hrs but goes downhill quickly.  There is alot of fun player interaction and trash-talking but it cannot be sustained.  Once you add expansions, play time increases which is a bad thing IMHO.

but the bits are so cool...

**Update 12/14/05** I played this over the weekend and enjoyed it. It was faster and more fun than I remembered. Nothing spectactular I grant, but it was fun. I also liked the board unfolding and the plastic hordes tickled me. 

I made a few minor changes to the rules by mistake (nothing affecting play too much actually) that ended up speeding up the game and made some weapons wicked fun.

I'm not sure that the whole series is worth the money, but if you enjoy the game and play it a fair ammount I'd want them for diversity if nothing else.

Zombies!!! led to a legendary night of gaming.  It was a 6 player game that lasted at least three hours.  Hour one was fun and everyone had a great time.  Hour two started to drag.  Hour three everyone wanted the game to end but no one wanted to quit because everyone was so close to winning.  And there was no way hell they were going to let the OTHER guy win.  Our mistake was to shuffle the deck after it ran out.  Everyone enjoyed the game, but no one wants to play again.

Early zombie game that's simple in rules, with two ways of winning: either kill 25 or escape town. Minis are more detailed than typical American games and help give the sense of theme. It's quick to learn, but the value totally depends on who you are playing with.

BIG PLUS: theme, ease of play
BIG MINUS: not much to the game to keep players fully into it for long

El tema de los zombies me parece atrayente... pero en las películas (y dependiendo de la película).

Este juego es un tira dados que no tiene sentido, en el que llega un momento en el que rezas no por salvar tu vida, sino porque alguien llegue al maldito helicoptero.

Creo que se hace un poco pesado.

Played a couple of times before getting back into gaming and discovering BGG. This game is diverting, but can drag on and lacks any real decisions. It's more like watching a game and chuckling at everyone's misfortunes (or rare moments of ass-kicking). Can't really imagine choosing to play again.

Fun zombie hoarde game. Run around town trying to get 25 kills while picking up helpful bullets and health. Or scurry to find the helicopter port. The art is cool, and it has everything we love about bad horror movies. If you like zombies, or killing zombies I definitely would recommend this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It´s stupid and senseless, and the strategy is...no. But it´s funny and if you don´t care of losing and dying again and again, you can have a nice session.
I sugest, anyway this houserule: When the heliport tile has been placed, count 20 full rounds (each player has his 20 rounds) and if those 20 rounds end and no player has won the game, the helicopter flees, so, game over and all players lose.

R.I.P. Todd.

 Zombies was a great buy when it first came out and still is. There are other games that have surpassed it gameplay wise but not many have surpassed it in the bang for your buck department.

If played with some of the variant rules it really is a decent game and it really does deserve it's place in the history of gaming. 

What follows are my original comments.

I haven't actually played using the rules that come with the game. Drops a point if I do. There are plenty of variants out there and scenarios so you can find a game here that you will like if your any kind of zombie fan at all. Buy the game, download some variants and enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have a soft spot for this game, because this is the game that introduced me to the world of board gaming. A few years ago a game shop opened in my city, and I saw this zombie game. Loving zombies, I decided to give it a try. Before this game I had never even heard of a game with a modular board, so you can imagine my surprise. I remember thinking, "Why isn't this more common?! This is great!" And that lead me to search for modular board games, and that lead me to Carcassonne and that lead me here. Life has never been the same, ha.

Weight: Light
Audience: Horror fans, fans of zombies (title didn't give that away, did it?)
Number of players: 2-6.
Components: They're pretty good. The map tiles are thin. They're made of a durable glossy paper and not cardboard, but they're of good quality. The hearts and bullet tokens (of which there are many, all of them are tiny) could have perhaps been better outlined on a kind of character sheet or card, but that may not have really worked with the nature of how simple this game is intended to be.
Rules: Simple. 
Setup: Very quick.
Game-flow: This game can perhaps drag on if played by the rules that come in the box, but Twilight Creations website, as well as the Geek, can fix that issue for you with an abundance of altered rules and variants.
Randomness: High.
Player interaction: Mid to low.
Fun: Depending on the mood and group, I could rate this game anywhere from 3 up to 6.
Theme: Works for me. Zombies are everywhere, and you're running around an unfamiliar city!
Recommended to: See Audience.

This game has potential of being good but wasn't. It should have been done differently. Over powered playing cards, long game of reading cards and doing repeats to find it all doesn't matter in the end, and weapons are poorly done like it's combat system. It isn't worth it to me, but it has some silly moments that leaves you not hating the game completly.

I've played one 6-player game and would rather see myself playing this with lesser amount of players. Moving system is a problem as is downtime and I'm not quite sure that the 2 winning conditions are properly balanced.

Movment is a problem in this game.  Roll a bunch of ones and you are doing nothing.  Cards with location specific weapons are useless, due to the difficulty of moving.

Thanks for this one Todd! You brought a lot of joy to some of my friends and for that I'm very thankful.

Played twice. I won't ever play again if I can avoid it. 100% pure luck, long, and mostly boring although some screwage cards can elicit a laugh or two now and then. Production is mixed. You get some soft plastic figs. The board is made up of thin cardboard tiles that lack any sort of variety unless it's a 'named' location (Fire Station, Gas Station, Sports Store, etc) so it mostly looks boring and nothing like a city once the tiles are layed out, but more like a maze. Would have been better to keep the zombies but make it a hedge maze or dungeon, at least it'd make more sense. If the game play was anything other than luck with a few screwage cards, the production wouldn't matter at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
LOTS of fun, despite the vague instructions. We had to refer to FAQ's and join the Zombies!!! yahoo forum to search out unanswered questions in he small manual, and there's still a number of situations that may come up in this game that will leave us wondering what to do. As the game builds, the zombie infestation increase; you can run, but not for long as your opponents will use their cards and move the Zombies around to wreak all kinds of havoc in your path -- (of course, you'll be doing the same). Depending on your goal, slicing and dicing through hordes of zombies can be a good or bad thing. Do you go for zombie kill count, or race for the heli-pad for a quick escape. Oh wait, the helipad isn't present yet - where on the board will it appear...?

Lots of plastic zombies in the second edition, (2 bags..grey/green - even Zombie Gals). The ghoulishly-funny card illustrations are excellent, as are the map tiles; what I wasn't happy with were the bullet and life heart punch outs which are very tiny, making them a bit annoying to handle and place on a map card. Get a group together and let those Zombies 'Have Some'. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
To be honest, not my sort of game. Having said that, what it sets out to do it does so with style. A zombie game should be simple, fun, and thematic. Zombies!!! does all three perfectly.

A game with some potential that disappointed me a little. Great fun until the endgame, at which point repeated attempts to kill the leader and the drawn-out end of the game killed it for me somewhat.

Update: Repeated attempts to make the game more entertaining have all failed - the second half of the (long) game revolves entirely around blocking other players. Very dull.

What a horrible game.  I don't even... I mean okay.  Firstly, it's a dice rolling, theme driven, luck based thing.  That's one problem, but really, this game is like long, SLOW and annoying to play.

RATING: 1
The rulebook should have clued me in - whenever a game has using house rules that are commonly accepted it typically means that the game itself is already broken. When a game ENCOURAGES IT IN THE RULEBOOK gravely ill omens have been marked, for here there be garbage. 

If this game wasn't about zombies it would be nearly universally despised and people would never play it. This is a horrible game - maybe the worst game I've ever played. 

The game's draw mechanic is inherently broken. Many of the game's cards are "take that!" cards that seriously hamstring one's opponents - and since there is no penalty for playing as many cards as possible (since one can always draw up to full). This would be fine, if ...

combat wasn't so utterly broken and agonizing. There are a few cards in the deck that make combat actually viable - but since most of the game's meat de facto is trying to screw one's neighbors they are seldom seen and rarely able to be used. Players are guaranteed to die many, many times, which puts them very close to square one and utterly qipes out what progress they have made. Since this happens to everyone the game quickly falls into frustration until ...

the tile for the Helipad is drawn. But even this action, which would mercifully end the game, can be wrecked by virtually any player. This game goes on forever and ever, and I've played more than one game that has just ended with attrition to watch Road House or something.

I've left out other critical problems such as the roll-and-move mechanic, the pointless tiny chits when a cardboard character sheet would be far more practical - but this game is already a miserable enough experience without them. There are no meaningful decisions to be made, the dice determine far too much of what happens in the game, and ever action in this game is much more akin to what would make one lose least as opposed to gain most. The game's bits aren't bad (except for the tiny chits) - I've met more than one person who has considered buying the game _because a good game can be made in it somewhere_. That says something.

RATING: 9
I love this game! There is very little wrong that I can speak of, except that you WILL need to buy more zombies (the 100 it comes packaged with aren't enough). The games can be quite long - we've had one last as long as 4 hours. The game is well-balanced and the play is intense.

RATING: 8
Great graphics and theme with appealing horde of 100 zombies to play with.  Competition to win is ruthless, with most cards being used to screw your opponents and can be played at any time to thwart their strategies.  My only complaints are the life & bullet tokens which are small, fiddly & similar, and the fact that the game goes on a bit too long - this can be changed by removing a few city tiles but it seems a shame to do so.  We played with 6 players and it was tedious, 2 or 3 was about right.  Expansion pack of cards 3.5 adds to game play.  All other expansions are optional.  The game has lots of fun scenarios (such as 'pizza delivery') at the manufacturers website: http://www.twilightcreationsinc.com/zombies/

This is the game that I got into gaming with. (Try selling that to the "gateway game" crowd!) So it has some nostalgia value, but is also simple enough to be a good game to relax with. No thinking, just shoot zombies and screw your friends! (I'm coming to the conclusion that if you want to make a thematic game, less is more when it comes to the rules. You get more interesting stories that way.) Just make sure you set a time limit.

Buen juego, si te gusta el puteo entre jugadores este es tu juego!!

Si andas buscando un juego donde el putear al contrario sea la premisa del juego, sin duda lo has encontrado.

tiene la fama de ser un tiradados sin alma y un factor suerte muy alto, si bien es verdad, yo creo que su encanto radica ahi mismo, junto con la simplicidad de las reglas y la facilidad de crear las tuyas propias.

No busques estrategia porque no la encontraras. Busca puteo y simplicidad de reglas.

El inconveniente es que es necesaria una mesa de juego muy muy grande debido a la expansion del tablero modular a medida que se va descubriendo la ciudad.

Recomiendo jugar con 2 o 3 personas, con mas personas el juego se alarga muchisimo!

Silly dicefest with a lot of zombies. Surprisingly high component quality considering the game's price. Way too long for what it is though, but it scratches a very particular itch thanks to its dead simple nature, making it worth playing on carefully selected occasions. 

On the one hand, if you want a remotely deep game, don't even dare touching it. Consider fleeing to another country if you are being pressed into it. And if that doesn't work, set yourself ablaze. It'll probably be less painful than enduring a whole gaming session.

On the other hand, if you have a really silly day, it's perfect. You know, one of those days when you don't want to give things a second thought. When all you want to do is rolling dice. When your decisions are taken because "Zombie conga line! LOL!". All while simultaneously rambling about life, the universe and everything. If you are having one of these days, then [i]Zombies!!![/i] is just THE GAME. Specially when playing with the "mandatory bowls of chips and cold refreshments" variant.

The house rules on the maker's site are quite good.

RATING: 3
I'm not at all certain why this game is so popular. The art is not bad, the gameplay is a bit sluggish and the strategy is, well, not very present. Die rolls and card draws rule the game, and there's a lot of moving bits around that don't need to be moved. Also, playing takes too long for what it is, much like the more recent Twilight Creations game, "Dante's Inferno".

The theme is fun and any game where you use a grenade to blow up a toy store full of the walking dead can't be all bad, but this one just ambles by, dropping stinky chunks as it goes.

The suggested rules found on this website would improve the game considerably - my gaming group doesn't want to play the game again with the rules as they exist. 

Two parting shots - do some proofreading on the rulesheet and cards, please - it's not like there are a lot of them. Secondly, NEXT time, make the bullet and life counters look a little different, for goodness sake. Reverse the black and white, put a little letter on them, colour one red - anything! Just make it easier to tell them apart at a glance.

Someone once described Zombies!!! to me as "The perfect template to make a great game". The components are great, the tiles and figurines can be used for many games, ...

Unfortunately the actual game is horrible. And your turn if you get a 1 on the dice, you will only move once, which means you will do almost nothing on your turn, while someone getting a 6 will get weapons, kill lot of zombies, etc...

After that, it gets even worse, with the dreaded "Munchkin ending". If people are used to boardgame, then everyone will block everyone else for 1 or 2 hours, a few tiles away from the helicopter through the play of "screw you" cards. Then, finally someone will be lucky enough to get a good enough roll, and none of his opponents will have bad cards to stop him, and this game will finally ends.

One of my group's problems was that the item cards were pretty pointless: you take 5 turns to get across town to play a card which gives you a minor bonus for one turn.  Seems like we also had a number of problems with ambiguous cards or rules.

The tiles are beautifully done, and I appreciate the attempt at a zombie-escape game. But the dice add too much randomness and eat up too much time.

I may buy this game. I may get every expansion. But I would be using house rules for movement, that's for sure.

I found the mechanics interesting enough, although the game requires a more aggressive approach than our game group prefers.  In addition, some of the artwork is more obscene than we would like in this household.  Still, you get to kill lots o' zombies, and there are plenty of expansions to keep things interesting.

I am a huge zombie fan, yet I cannot understand why people like this game. The order of phases within a turn is counter-intuitive; the play quickly grows repetitive and boring, removing any zombie flavor; and ultimately chance and not strategy will determine the winner.

Easy to learn and enjoyable, especially if you are a fan of the Zombie film genre.

The random map creation element is great and ensures that no game is ever the same twice. 

It really does feel like you're in a zombie infested town.

I think endgame kind is slightly unblanced because in my playthroughs, more often then not, the player who wins is the one who is simply the closest to the helicopter pad when that tile is revealed - and sometimes simply getting yourself killed is the best option in the end as it will allow you to transport back to town center and more often than not take the fastest route to the helipad.

All about the theme here.

An okay game of which I have a ton of the expansions.  Overall, I feel like the game runs a bit longer than I would like it to.  Resources are scarce, which helps add to the feel of the game, but really end up dragging things out.  

I think the worst contributor to this is the "lose half of your zombies" on death rule.  If you die late in the game, it basically resets half of the game played up until that point.  

At the end of the day, it's based too much on luck to be a staple game that I break out frequently.

Watch out for punishing one player too much: I have a friend who outright refuses to play this anymore because of something that happened years ago.

This is not a boardgame. More like taking a (very) long combat session from a RPG and stripping away all combat rules. Played it with 3 players and short rules variation. Everyone was bored to death (took an hour), will never play again. Note that I&#039;m an old fan of zombie films. The _only_ strategy in this game involves moving zombies towards other players. Doing this makes the targeted player more likely to win because of more kills... Original rules make more sense. The cool box/artwork raises my rating. Can probably be used as a companion to a RPG campaign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
70% of map generally remains unused which is a huge bummer.  Venturing into buildings for bullets/hearts is nearly always a losing gamble if you take the initiative (clean up after another player for the win though).  Building-Specific cards are nearly useless given how large the map is when actually played out.  Not much strategy other than to make a dash for the chopper or to know when to "strategically die" in order to restart with your 3/3 count.  Trying to accumulate 25 kills is damn near impossible and almost certainly leads to players dashing for the chopper as the winning strategy.

Suggested house rules or updates: [1] Building cards can be played in any building (chainsaw, skateboard, etc.), [2.] Either kill limit is shortened to 15 zombies, or a winning dice roll is three and higher (for a 2/3rds chance of combat wins rather than 1/2 chance).

Una buena estrategia inicial (aunque es un juego de dados y por tanto de mucho y voluble azar) puede ser la siguiente:

1. En los primeros compases del juego y mientras no aparezca la ficha de Helipuerto, cuando toque mover zombies en tu turno, hacerlo de manera que se alejen todo lo posible de los rivales, de manera que éstos, si quieren matar zombies o entran en edificios o deben sacar tiradas de dados altas, lo que dificulta su "recolección" de zombies. 
Cuando aparezca la casilla de Helipuerto hacer todo lo contrario  y llenar el camino de zombies para ralentizar la llegada de los rivales al helicóptero.

2. Colocar las fichas de calle de forma que cuando esté cerca la posibilidad de salida del Helipuerto (cuando se haya colocado en juego la mitad del mazo de las fichas de calles, esto es, 14 fichas de terreno), esta casilla no pueda ponerse demasiado cerca de donde se encuentran los rivales y en cambio se coloque lo más cerca posible de ti; esto aumenta la posibilidad de que seas tú el que huya en helicóptero y gane la partida.

Seems like a cool idea, but ends up being a little too much of the same old thing, shooting lots of zombies and trying to escape.  The end game is very slow, as everyone dogpiles on anyone trying to finish.  For the genre (escaping certain doom and screwing your neighbor), I'd pick the lighter Abduction instead.

Zombies! Zombies everywhere! The "one card can be played per round" mechanism, where your own personal round is from the start of your turn to the beginning of your next one works well. There need to be more bullets in the game, but it's a lot of light fun. Besides, it's worth buying if for no other reason than you get 100 plastic zombies!

I've scavenged this game for parts (read I've co-opted the zombies for my RPG needs and don't have a need for the rest of it).

Real rating 3. 10 for the cancer fight.

RATING: 5
I've had some good games with this but the not-so-good games that last 3-4 hours are not so good. This game is so random sometimes that it easliy will lose the original rules and will become a heavily modded game. I don't like when a game needs new pieces to make it work (for example I use glass stones as bullet markers and the life markers from DOOM). When you play with more than 2 people you will run out of zombies easily, the cards don't work the way they should and they only make the game longer and painful in some ways, I don't want to look for the Fire Station (or wait until it comes out), I want my flamethrower now! My friends love Zombies!!! so I will keep playing this for a long time, but most of the times I avoid it because of the small mistakes and worthless mechanics, when I do play I try to keep it as a "work with the mood of the table" instead of a serious or strategic game.

[Played mostly with: 5, played best with: 3-4]

Edit: I grow more tired of this game as I play it, I like how my friends behace in a friendly game, but the game is worthless regarding strategy, tactics or any kind of planning.

Way back when, this was one of the best zombie games around, because it was one of the only zombie games around. Now, it shows its age.

You win by either killing 25 zombies (tough, as combat is a rarely-modifiable dice roll, and your death cuts your current kill count in half) or being the first to the helipad, which is stacked at the bottom of the location tile stack.

Most games are decided by the helipad, which means milling around for 30 - 45 minutes waiting for it to hit the table, all the while stocking up on as many screw-you cards as possible. The end condition resembles Kill Dr Lucky's design and Munchkin's functional end state, where the winner is the player whose turn comes after the guy who soaked up all the stopper cards.

If you've seen a few cheesy zombie movies, nothing about this game will surprise you: they chase, you run, you fight a few times, then you maybe get to flee. I was underwhelmed when playing it with five others - tile placement got done with so quickly that there wasn't much time for strategy before we all just had to rush like maniacs for the helicopter pad. Might be quite  a bit more fun with 3-4 players at most, though.

This game consists of reaching the "exit" tile before other players - before that happens, players turn over city tiles and fight the zombies that appear. Since the game only really begins when the last city tile is placed on the board (and the helipad is turned over) the whole experience can be tedious.

You and the other players are in the middle of a city overrun by the living dead. Your goal is to slay 25 zombies or reach safety at the helipad. Cards are used to help your mission or muck up other players' plans. Each turn you place a new city block tile, move your character and move a random number of zombies (usually to harass the other players). It's a fun beer and pretzels game.

Just okay, but not as bad as it's often made out to be (okay, I guess this is the hardcore Ameritrasher in me speaking). Good to pull out when non-gamers are over. Get the user-created Quicker Play rules for a better game (it's a 5 with those rules, with the out-of-the-box rules, it's a 4). You can find them in the files section of the BGG Zombies!!! page.

Fast playing game but too long for it's simplicity. There's not much to do until the deck runs out and then it becomes a frantic race. We decided to put the Helicopter tile somewhere in the middle of the deck to shorten it...

I think this game has potential, but it's wasted.  I played with the original rules and the game seemed to be slow and lack interesting decisions, as well as be a little bit high on the luck.  Maybe I'll try some of the variants sometime and see if that will change things.  Too long to be good filler, to luck based to not be filler...

061030: played with the quicker play rules.  That made for a faster game, but it is still not worth playing.

I feel like there wasn't as much bullets and health as I wanted -- it was very easy to die. And I also didn't get a weapon, which was lame. Too much based on luck, couldn't do anything about it. I don't think I liked the part where you had to keep fighting the zombie until you killed it or it killed you. You can't control your own fate, dependent too much on luck. I couldn't really strategize, which was lame. And you can only hold three cards, which is okay. But at first I was holding useless ones. I really wanted to go to the stores to get more hearts and bullets. Malcolm's win felt anti-climatic. I remember I enjoyed the game though, but when I think about it, there are a lot of flaws. I'd like to try playing it with less roads, or cooperatively. It felt like it took me a long time to get nowhere (geographically on the board + no achievement).

Components: fabulous. Who doesn't like a bundle of tiny plastic zombies? Theme: excellent. On theme alone, this game seems like it would be a winner. Gameplay: random (so, so random), broken, and awful.

Maybe there's a planet where watching one person get lucky and blaze through the game -- picking up the best shit and having a ball while everyone else languishes at the back of the pack because of random draws -- is fun, but I don't live there.

I'd rather pay someone to punch me in the throat than ever play this game again.

Roll some dice and cross your fingers. The best strategy is the worst strategy: Just run into the horde and hope you roll the dice you need.

1 / 5 - Bad.

This should be a fast-playing action game, but it isn't, at least not with five players like I tried it. Having to dig tokens and figures out of the box each time a tile is laid makes downtime a real pain with this one - all the more so since if you roll poorly for movement on your turn you're effectively doing nothing anyway, making things drag further. Has a nasty tendency to extend its play time past the welcome stage as well and it looks like the winner is often going to be the one who places the helipad. This might be more fun with 2 or 3 players but I can't say I'm inspired enough to bother finding out.

Pros: loads of cool zombie minis. Can be used to lure newbies into board games. 

Cons: This is a luck driven screw your neighbor sort of game. No strategy or tactics needed to win. If you just want a brainless laugh then Zombies delivers. If you want a bit more out of your game there are many more Zombies games out there and most of them are much better than this one. The best I've found so far is Lock 'N Load's All Things Zombie.

There is a popular move to rate this game a 10 in order to support the designer, who is battling the advanced stages of cancer:  http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/940650/important-show-some-real-community-support 

I show my support for this cause by not reflecting my honest opinion in the BGG ratings.  I found the game dragged in the early and mid game, and our group deliberately cut the tile deck in order to hasten the end.  Only once the helipad tile appeared did the game get more interesting and focused - otherwise it was largely aimless shambling.  I wouldn't play it again if asked.  

But I wish the designer and those close to him all the best during what must be a terribly difficult time.

It was easy to find things that could have been improved in the design to make the game a bit easier.  Like making the valid street spaces and the building spaces a little more clear and obviously different.  

The game was fun at first but near the end it just kept dragging on and on and on.  Almost everyone go close to winning but the cards just delayed it soooo long, and one player almost won I think 5 turns in a row before finally being able to actually win, due to the cards played on him.

Zombies takes a little too long to play.  I think some of the cards are too powerful and some are pretty worthless (marbles).  It just seems like the rules need a lot of tweaking.

Common critique of Zombies!!! is, that this game takes too long, which is indeed true. Nevertheless it's at least fun to prevent other players from winning with mean cards.
Just add some rules of your own, if you want to speed up the game.
The rules are not very well written and leave some questions open, even the FAQ does not provide all the answers you need, mainly to figure out which cards work under which circumstances etc...

Great light game.  Don't think too much into it.  Played with my wife and friends.  All think it is fun, a bit too long.  But who can go wrong with 100 zombies.  Changed my rating, getting better with age and my kids are now playing.  Can't read the cards yet, but love killing the zombies!
Edit: 10+ years ago we got the base game. After all the expansions, and yes I have all, still a great fun game to play after all these years. Helps now with some house rules, but still a fun game in our books. Kids can now read all the cards, have tons of zombies, we just put all in a big bag and pull out as they come, adds visual variety to the game, made some of our our cards and away we go. Still a good price and lots of expansions to choose from. I think still deserves a 10 in my book and I don't see this changing.

English. Nice mechanic. I got a new Zombies!!! plus a few expansions. Since I already had a copy of this, it's up for grab! Box shows it wear. But the components are in great shape. When players are playing to slowly... add a hourglass... It's so much more fun!!

The only zombie themed game I own and one I like. I really like the tile mechanic, making it almost like an investigation game with a different map every game. Also the rolling mechanic balanced with the bullets is something I like, and the add of spoiling your friends, defeating the zombies, the hard  difficulty... Everything is good. But it gets old kind of fast (a long time since I played it)

Why the hell did I buy this? This is officially worst thing ever - and not only in the gaming industry! I love zobies in movies, games and so forth, but this is just plain stupid... This game is nothing but rolling dies. What kind of a game has a situations in it, where it's beneficial for you to get yourself killed?

This is a fun little game.  While it has a similar feel to Munchkin Quest, it seems far simpler and better contained, without resorting to massive character bloat.  The two-player game was a little too long for the fun that it provided, but perhaps it would be better with more players and more interaction.  Overall it's a fun, light experience that could easily be enjoyed among a group of casual gamers.

No, this is not the greatest game in the world, but if you are in the right mood, it can be mindless fun.  I would not play with more than 4 and 2 to 3 seems pretty good.  My biggest complaint is the lack of weapons in the game.  For light hearted fun, the game is ok for what it is trying to do.

Zombies! Second Edition is pleasant and suitable for fast games and fun with friends, counting on an average of 60 minutes, with faster start-up almost non-existent, since the elements involved will be placed from time to time at every turn. 
Do not expect some giocone the year. Zombies! Second Edition is a game that enjoys a great setting, an exceptionally high visual impact, but at the same time bit more fun that the complex game mechanics. What if one side can make up their noses to the hardcore gamer, you may reveal a winning move for the identification, referring to the frenzy, speed and immediacy that a situation would result. Exactly offset by the material really well made and attractive and can add value with its numerous expansions!

After one play (2-player game), I am fairly unimpressed. The idea is neat, and some of the cards are fun, but the end game is long and got quite tedious in our session. Each of us died at least a couple times within just a few squares of the helipad. A few of the rules are silly, and a few of the cards are vague about implementation. I'd prefer tiles that were a little thicker, as the thin, glossy stock makes them slide around too much. The minis don't do anything for me. I'm a hex and counter guy from back in the day, and so it made no difference to me to push minis rather than chits. Getting screwed and sent back to the town square or put in an impossible situation was fun but only up to a point. After a while, it just got aggravating. We got some laughs, but I think we got even more frustration. I would be willing to play a 3- or 4-player game to see how that goes.

Not even if this were substantially shorter would it be the answer to the most important question of our age: "What is the zombie game that doesn't suck?"

It is just like being in a Zombie movie.  I do like the feel.  However, I can see where it would get old quickly unless the expansions are wonderful.  Winning by killing 25 Zombies seems like a contrivance because there are folks in zombie movies who have killed more zombies than that and still didn't make it out.  Of course, the game could never end otherwise based on how it is constructed.  Would like to tray a few of the expansions to see how they do.  It is fun to play with my college age sons.

After several plays there are several things... it does not scale well... 2 player game is more of a zombie kill fest than trying to get to the helipad. There is just to many zombies on the board.

I usually take this game with me when we go camping. It's easy to cary around. Rules are straight forward; easy to play. But the game lacks depth and as you place more and more tiles you need a lot of room to play. We usually play it a couple of times during a 2 week camping trip.

Surprisingly enjoyable (relatively) quick game for up to six people -- even with dice-and-move, AT plastic minis, and Munchkin-esque screw-the-leader-to-prevent-a-win.  Game is simple for what it is, but it just seems to work -- not much brain power needed at all!  Not something I'd bust out all the time, but it helps fill a niche.

This game will always stay in my collection. It has great components at a fantastic price and it is so imminently hackable. If you are a game designer, you should have this game in your collection and look at all the ways you can make it your own.

But that doesn't mean you have to change anything. I play this game with my cousins and we have a blast screwing each other up every time we play. The constant struggle against each other is standard Zombie movie fair and we love all the amazing homegrown variants and scenarios. 

This is a game that is too often written off, but the point of games is to play them for fun and I've had a ton of fun playing this game.

Fun little game.  Nice components, easy to learn, relatively quick to play (though it can drag: recommend hunting around for some of the house rules, shuffling the last tile (helepad) into the last 5 or 10 city tiles can make it move a little quicker).  Shame the city tiles aren't a little thicker, as it's easy to bump the map and mess it up.

I think the zombie genre remains full of potential for new games.  Zombies!!! is a "cool" game, but seems to become long and tedious.  The mechanics are simple and don't appear to have benefited from the knowledge of the clever and interesting mechanics one finds is so many of the most popular German games.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast paced and frantic! It's Resident Evil in board game form as players unveil a city teeming with undead zombies and must either battle their way to the landing pad and hop onto the last chopper out, or kill 25 zombies! A fun "not-too-much-thinking" game that's hard to resist, especially if you like the theme and genre. Bonus for no elimination. House rules and variants are encouraged and probably a good idea as this game can take a long time when played out of the box.

Played only once and it was a painful experience. A friend brought it over and we dove in hoping it might be a little better than Humans!! (No idea WHY I hoped that . . .)

But you have the annoying possibility of a virtually random "reset" knocking you way behind.

+ .5 can give you an "i'm kicking ass" feeling -  helped by the fact this game includes 100s of miniatures ... but only if you're not inclined to think too hard (or are drunk) -

+ .5 plenty of 'gotcha!' elements that can work somewhat well for competitive versions with the right group/setting... but also has the 'everyone destroys the person in the lead' side-effect, with no mitigating design choices. 

+ .5 collaborative mode can work and be enjoyable... but this can make a lot of the aspects of the game redundant or like a slog. 


-2 overall, just broadly shallow on strategy and mechanics once you get past the core mechanic of mowing down zombies. 


Fun for when people are drunk but still want to play a boardgame.

It's Zombies!!! with nicer looking tiles, but the zombie babes would be better if they wern't all holding a head in one hand and a completely different colour to the other zombies, it brakes up the "hoard" look and takes away some of the visual entertainment of the game.

Straight out of the box this game can get repetative and go on for too long, but it's simplicity allows for plenty of rules adapting for those who aren't happy. Either way it was one of the gateway games that sucked me into the hobby.

I've totally scrapped the whole rulebook and made a brand new game that simply uses some of the components- and it's great!

With variants it is an ok game.  I won both times though by running to the helipad.  Perhaps realistically, the best way to win is by trying to avoid zombies.  :)  Played with (health + 2) = movement and move 3 zombies every turn.  Next time we'll let you grab an item by walking into a shop that has an empty square.  Also, I think the event deck is very harsh.  A custom deck might be the best.  The custom deck would have less powerful event cards.  

I also might try to play a left 4 dead variant.

It is a great thing to pick up though for the zombie pieces and city tiles.  The zombies will be useful in print and play games like Zombie Plague.  The city map tiles could be useful for other print and plays.

At the end of each turn, you have to move a bunch of zombies, even though it can often be of no consequence. Fiddly and time-consuming mechanic.

The game can go way too long unless someone gets lucky quickly.

2-6 players.  60 minutes. While I was dating my ex Vanessa, who had this game, I started working on an expansion.  Now, I have picked up my own copy and can continue the good effort.  The expansion is called Zombie Challenge!!! and makes the game a game show where contestants are dropped into the middle of a zombie filled town and must fight zombies for cash and prizes!

RATING: 4
Just great entertainment if you feel in the mood for some mindless fun.  Run around and splatter zombies before getting splattered yourself.  Watch your fellow players shout in frustration as you lay waste to their already precarious situation with the right event card at the right moment.  What's not to love about this...  Well maybe the fact that sometimes games tend to keep on going, and going, and going...

RATING: 10
As a game, Zombie!!! can't reach more than a 5 rating out of the box. But the "advanced" house rules you can find on the 'Net pump up this rating up to a 7, and if you buy the game as a Zombie game construction kit, this can ramp up even higher. I've made a cooperative variant for it that is really good and it allows one or two players to play a fast resident evil style adventure... I leave the rating at 7, even if my game can easily reach 8 for sheer fun factor. Be advised: this is a game for tinkerer, but in right hands can truly shine.

Funny ideas, yes and it is a good parodie of zombiemovies. But not more than a "typicle" american dice game with simple rules... 

1. Take a handcard.
2. Take a citycard and place it 
3. Roll the dices for the figth / roll it for your moving (this I Hate most!)/ roll it for the zombiemoving.
(4.) Play ONE card when ever you want it

The players figth a bit to eachother. This is very funny - in the first 60 minuts. But this game need 30-45 minuts or more for each player. To long for a dicegame.

RATING: 4
"Will somebody please win?" That was the sentiment after an almost two-hour game with six players. There's no mechanic for ending the game except the victory of one player, and the other players can almost endlessly interfere with that one. Once all the tiles are out it's just a monotonous rush toward the exit, trying to luck out against the zombies and hope that nobody messes with your movement. Most of the better weapons and abilites requires specific locations to activate, which is rarely worthwhile. All in all, not a very compelling game even if it was sped up.

RATING: 2.5
This game has become too old. The manual should have been polished during all those years, it still leaves some things unclear.

The endgame conditions are way too difficult. It says it lasts 60 minutes... My games always lasted more than double that ammount. After the first half an hour, I become bored of doing the same over and over and not having any progress done, and I just wish for the game to end.

The game is too random, and there are too many "take that" cards, one player will finally win because he will find himself in a position to use one of his cards to win (by chance or because the other players just want the game to finish :p).

75% of the event cards will be usless (there's only one weapon really useful).

I can think of much better games to play. I will do my best to avoid playing this one again.

Nicely thematic brainless beer & pretzels dicefest, with an annoying reset button. Moderately entertaining in the right context. Just make sure to play this without expansions, otherwise the game will never end.

Setting up all those Zombies is lots of fun: the board looks like an actual Zombie flick.  But, like most of the movies of the same genre, the game is a bit predictable and can plod along: lots and lots of gore until a deus ex machina resolution.

RATING: 6
This is a game that CAN be hilarious fun, but it isn't necessarily. A bit too light and a bit lot too long. I wish it was more tense, the zombies were faster and that there were more tactical options. 

Thinking about house rules:
- roll 26d instead of 1?
- running zombie variant? Assign movement points instead of 1 movement/zombie?
- abandon the only 1 card per turn limit?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great beer and pretzels game. Needs some house rules to tighten it up though.
1. Movement is still 1d6 but you always roll at least your health. So if you have 3 health you round up anything less than 3 up to 3.
2. Instead of placing a tile at the start of turn. Players have to actually explore new tiles. Players can see up to 1 tile away as long as line of sight exists and they're not in combat with a zombie.
3. When you die you place a zombie on the nearest empty space.

No great shakes in design, compared to more contemporary games, but very good in its time, and still can be fun, but more likely so if one limits the size of the draw deck, to keep the game reasonably short. I like the plastic zombie figures and the human toting shotguns, and the artwork on the events cards is a hoot. I do think it's a design that verily invites variations, as many have suggested on BGG. My 10-year-old rated it an 8.5 (July 2009) and after his first play, he and I started sharing ideas for how to add our own variations to certain rules. After a few more plays (August 2009), he bumped his rating up to 9.5. Finally, I also think it's one of those games that one has to bring one's own passion to; otherwise it would seem slow to play and dull by comparison with other games, especially more recent games. Personally, I like to use the rule which allows players to randomly insert the helicopter pad tile into the bottom half of the (28-tile) stack, to speed things up, as there's not enough to the game play itself to justify a longer game, and there's too much of a feeling of doing the same thing over and over, which tends to drag down the enjoyment. Plus the sheer number of player-inspired rules variations indicates a design that came up short, even though it's also a franchise game. Purchased used, October 2008.

Zombies!!! is a 30 minute game that takes 3 hours to play. 

The theme makes no sense - why are the humans trying to screw each other over - surely they should be working together? And the theme is the only thing this game has going for it! 

It is roll and move, has cards that say things like 'miss a turn' or 'go back to the start.' Fighting is done by rolling dice. It is one of those games that never terminates because everyone plays 'bash the leader' cards when someone is about to win, until either everyone runs out of cards and someone manages to win, or you give up in frustration.

Truly dreadful.

It would be useable as a game for young children, except the gory artwork is unsuitable.

Maybe we could make a new game out of the components in the box. 

I ended up posting my copy to a trade scammer who never posted anything in return.

Trashy fun. I enjoyed exploring the modular board while collecting bullets and dismembered hearts plus fighting zombies although all the tokens and figurines were a bit fiddly. Found matching the cards to the location tiles difficult especially as the text had different orientations depending on the tile placement and would have preferred something like icons to help pattern match.

This is a perfect example of a game that needs to strictly control it's play-length. It should be a short and fun filler game. Instead our single play was a 2.5 hour slog of endless 1d6 rolling. That's waaaay too long for this type of game.

It is as it says on the box... This one's a no-brainer. So the group really needs to be in the mood for this one. If so, then it can be a really fun game, where you try and chop those zombies dead, whilst screwing the opponent players the best you can... if they gang up against you though... there's no mercy in this game. But it's not for everyone. Fun this one. If only taking in account the game mechanics I'd probably give it only a 6, but I put another point on it for the great thrash-zombie concept!

Got this when it first came out. I don't have ALL the expansions, because they all became the same. The circus one is kind of a waste of money. Most of the expansions I have add a bit to the game. But absolutely DEADTIME STORIES is THEE expansion to get now: it adds much needed CHARACTER cards so people don't all have to play the "shotgun dude" and there is a scenario book, to expand the goal of the game. PLUS in the new 3rd edition (and, thankfully, in the 13th expansion which I did get) NEW ZOMBIE SCULPTS!

Meh.  I've played a few times.  This is a fun game, but no strategy, too much luck, and overall, I just don't want to play it that much.

If you are worried about running long, just take out some cards/decrease the # of zombies needed to win. I did this, cut the cards to 6 per person in a 3 player game and put the chopper in last 4. Also decreased kill target to 15/20 (vs. 25) and it made it a fairly quick and enjoyable 3p game.

Shortened games of this are key. That's important here. 

Fun for awhile, but I have since poached the zombies for other games, and the box for Mogul.

Un gioco senza pretese, ma divertente (e con ottimi componenti). Raggiunge la sufficienza per almeno tre motivi:
1. L'ambientazione: il sottoscritto ha un debole per gli zombi. Ogni pezzo del gioco (carte, edifici, situazioni, anche lo scopo del gioco) è si ispira a una delle cento pellicole dove sono protagonisti.
2. L'ironia: tutto, dalle istruzioni alle carte azione, ne è pervaso. Meglio di un gioco sugli zombi c'è un gioco sugli zombi (auto)ironico.
3. L'interazione tra giocatori: tutti si mettono i bastoni tra le ruote. Le coltellate migliori si danno quando esce la tessera finale.
E poi è semplicissimo quel tanto che basta per coinvolgere anche amici a digiuno di boardgame.

As one of the 'early' zombie games of the more recent fascination starting in the 2000's, I think Twilight did a solid job with this.

RATING: 4
Rating Change:  After years of owning Zombies!!! and many plays, I've decided that I simply do not like the game.  I tried, I really did, but the combination of clunky rules (1d6 movement can often leave you with nothing to do on your turn save for taking a couple of uneventful steps through empty tiles), 50/50 combat and extreme downtime in a six player game just makes the whole thing an exercise in tedium for me.  Whenever it hits the table it's sort of fun for the first couple of rounds and then it just gets stale fast.  It's also one of the few games I know of where the guy in last place has the best chance of winning, and how can that ever be a good thing?  Bleh, I'll bring Last Night on Earth to the table before this game every time now.

There are two things that are absolutely necessary to make this game work, the first being that you must be more than two players, otherwise the zombies become much too static.

Crossing the Bar
By Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Sunset and evening star,
      And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
      When I put out to sea,

   But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
      Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
      Turns again home.

   Twilight and evening bell,
      And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
      When I embark;

   For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
      The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
      When I have crost the bar.

Simple, silly, cutthroat mechanics make this a very good game to play with my family when I feel like just having fun vs. actually being challenged. Although I need to play it a few more times before the fun of the cards vanishes, I think this will probably last a bit. One note to make is that you will place waaaay more zombies than you will ever encounter. You will probably spend more time positioning and moving zombies than your own piece. Recommended for people that are not into heavy board games and just want to spend a bit of time playing.

RATING: 7

Straight out of the box the game is clunky and counter intuitive so time is well spent altering the rules to your liking. By all means play the game with its original rules to get a feel of how the game was intended but I'm sure you'll want to make changes early on.

Zombies!!! is fun, especially when you manage to totally screw over another player and laugh as they fall foul to the undead :) The random board generation works in its favour but can take up a lot of space so make sure you have a big table or play on the floor. The book keeping can get pretty tiresome after a while (placing zombies, ammo, bullets every turn) but this can be counteracted once players know the game well and agree to play really quickly. Playing quickly is a necessity especially if you're playing with an expansion + the core set, otherwise the game will get bogged down and go on all night.

I'm giving Zombies!!! a 7 because although it's a good, fun game its flaws are many and patently obvious to the degree that one wonders how such oversights made it to production.

A very unsatisfying random game. Even as a filler it is not worth spending time on. Roll die to see if you can capture a zombie, roll die to move, roll die to move zombies, play a card to waste an opponent's move...yuck!  Probably will never play this again.

I would rather watch a zombie movie and roll a die to see who wins this game. Totally random luckfest. The helipad placement determines the winner and collecting 25 (?) zombies is unrealistic (never seen it happen).

Very dependent on the luck of the dice outcome. Rules are easy to understand and even non gamers could play this. We changed winning conditions down to 20 zombie kills instead of 25. None of use made it to the chopper yet.

A great idea, but flawed in gameplay.The artwork is gorgous, the cards humerous. I wish the tiles were a bit heavier though, if I sneeze it seems they would fly away! Have to play this a couple more times with some of the expansions and maybe some house rules.

The first of the series! It's simple and a dice-feast, but as a fan of horror movies I like this game for the theme and for its endless customization possibilities. Good components and a good 'infested-city' feeling! Back-stabbing a go-go!
But remember: 'This one's a no-brainer!' :)

Yep it is a dice fest. as you try to get to the escape point and make sure your opponents turn into Zombie fodder. One opponent made references to the zombie conga line, the way the moved that is about how it looked.
More than a bit repetitious.

Liked the B movie theme and cool minis.

RATING: 4
The more I played it, the more I realized how obnoxious the mechanics of this game are. It's ameritrash through and through, and really is best played as a thematic experience, which it's fairly weak at. The game is mostly just durdling around until the helicopter shows up, since I don't think anyone has ever won by collecting zombie trophies since you need so many. Then whoever drew the helipad just puts it as close as possible to them and (most likely) wins the game. It's just not very satisfying overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game with modular board pieces as the last remaining people in a city overrun with zombies try to reach the helicopter. Really ment to be played competitvely. Can get repetitive. My wife only enjoys cooperative games and I love playing games with my wife therefore this game is no longer in our collection.

Game sucks do not buy at full price. The best thing you can get out of this is the theme and zombie miniatures. The player miniatures look really lackluster, and the mechanics in this game are terrible. There is a BGG file to help houserule the game, but honestly your time should be spent on a wellmade zombie game if you're into that genre.

Played the game for the first time.  It is a lot of fun with a group of non-gamers.  However, it has way too much luck and not enough decision making for the player to make it really a great game for my own enjoyment.  It is a bit too long.  I have downgraded it.  TERRIBLE TWO PLAYER GAME!

I love the expanding map mechanic on a turn-by-turn basis.  Love, love, love, love, love it.  Love it.  I also greatly enjoy a game based solely on screwing your opponent.  It's a welcome change of pace on occasion.  Unfortunately, once the map reaches a certain size (especially once the helipad comes out), the map building mechanic loses every single bit of attraction.  The game stops being about killing zombies and exploring the map segments, and it becomes entirely about making a mad dash for the helipad.  Often times we won't even place zombies on the tiles that come out after the helipad, as they are entirely obsolete.  Why would a person run to the opposite side of the map just to slay some more zombies or grab more ammo and health when the endgame is right there?  Also, there are several occasions in which you'll have a great item you'd love to use, but you can't because the building that it requires has not yet been produced on the map.  Zombies!!! is a fun diversion, but a deeply flawed game.

Wow. Who knew blowing the heads off zombies could be so drawn out and boring? We cut this off less than a quarter of the way through. I agree with those who designed their own house rules - the constant laying of tiles and the HORDES of zombies, the exceedingly dull combat, the lack of tension...I'd be interested in playing Last Night on Earth just to see if it is possible that horror movies CAN make a decent game. On the plus side, I borrowed Shaun of the Dead the following day from a friend. I've never seen a zombie movie.

Just too random and messy.  The plastic zombies are good, but the rest of the components are poor.  The tiles are too thin and easily displaced while the cards slide across the table like a drunken hovercraft pilot.  I don't enjoy playing this game and will avoid it in the future.

Overall pretty fun, but I think they could have made better use of the cards, i.e. make them more useful so it's actually worth it to go out of your way to get them. Other than that the game flows pretty well.

Would be a lot more fun if it didn't take FOREVER to finish.  I like to tell people: it takes 90 minutes to get to the last square, and another 90 minutes to finish it.  There's just too many zombies, and too many cards to keep other players from winning.

I was surprised to see this one on the BGG rankings the other day and that I hadn't rated it. One of our gaming group (the one obsessed with zombie games, of course), owns this, and we've played it a fair few times, although (thankfully) not for ages. It is absolutely awful, and really no fun unless you happen to love anything with zombies in it. To make matters worse, there are lots of cards you can play on someone else's turn to try to screw them over - this kind of thing is OK in moderation, but here it makes the last few turns go at glacial pace as everyone plays a card on the player who's about to reach the exit.

I guess it's OK very occasionally if there is plenty of alcohol involved ;)

For a fun game can't beat this one, but it is definitely not a game player's game.  If you’re looking for a game to play with tight rules avoid this one – more of an experience than a game.  Sorta liking going to the movies, but getting to play out the fight against the zombies.

This game is easy to play and fun for a while. Unfortunately some games can drag on. We tend to ignore the rule about the helicopter landing being shuffled into the second half of the deck. Usually plays quickly that way.

Fine dice game with zombie theme, unpretentious, and ideal for playing it having a few beers with friends with autopilot-mode-ON and that's it. Nothing more to say. The best thing is that there´re a lot of home rules on the Internet that can be applied, and improve the gaming experience and you can enjoy different game modes. In addition, with your imagination, with the 100 figures of zombies that brings this base game (you can use them for other zombies games if you wish...), and all the tiles (and creating/printing new ones), you can even create a new game by yourself, and for the low prize that customizable side for me is great.

A good beer & pretzels kind of game. Roll the dice, kill some zombies, screw your buddy. It's simple, it's fun. There are a lot of opportunities for big moments, with players completely surrounded and yet still finding their way to safety (or going down in a blaze of glory).

I prefer this game without any of its (numerous) expansions. While adding extra mechanics and locations to most games is fun, this game works well because it is so simple.

That said, I would suggest trying a game or two of Zombies!!! combined with the Humans!!! spin-off; some players play as zombies instead of survivors, and each player has a unique goal. It changes things up in an interesting way, and while the zombie players have a few more rules they need to know, anyone can still opt to play as a survivor, keeping the game about as simple for them as it was before.

Played once. Gave up in frustration as end-game clearly going on for ever. (OK eventually someone would have  won with no. of zombies - about when all our teeth fell out - but no one was getting to that damned helicopter). Not only did we run out of zombies we nearly ran out of the white people from Age of Empires III as stand-in zombies. Maybe we missed something or just played a tad too aggressively but it was not a fun experience.

I'd read this was a lame game, and it is indeed the most disappointing game I've played in a long time.  Vague parts in the rules, ambiguous confusing map tile art (another triumph of cool art over functionality), but worst of all it has very little excitement and doesn't really capture the feel of a zombie horror film.  It's more like a tedious repetitive dice fest that drags on forever.  Your randomly rolled movement points each turn are too few, so it takes forever to move around the map.  It dragged on and on, and we eventually got too tired to continue and just went to sleep.  The game box doesn't tell how long the game takes, and I wonder if it's because they don't know because no one ever finished a game.

A hundred plastic zombies are a fun idea, but it feels like that was the core idea of the game, and the rules were just slapped together to have an excuse to sell a hundred plastic zombies in a box.

It was also annoyingly inconvenient that the life and bullet counters are printed only one one side (red life, black bullets) with indistinguishably identical white backs.  They get moved around and accidentally flipped over a lot, so they really should have been printed on both sides.
 
The 2-player card game Zombiaki is playable in less than half an hour and much better captures the feel of a zombie film.

=== 

Meanwhile the game has a bogus misleading high rating with roughly a thousand people "temporarily" rating it "10" due to [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/940650]a campaign in March 2013 to raise its rating as high as possible[/url] (and people like me who had rated it low even received direct geekmails pressuring them to change their rating).

Despite this "10" campaign being "temporary" with people supposed to restore their honest ratings soon thereafter, most of those "10" ratings still remain, years later.

RATING: 6
13-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. I may have played Zombies!!! over 10 years ago, but I forgot. Zombies!!! is a classic game about Escaping from bunch of Zombies!!! in a city by being the first to kill 20 zombies, or empty and reach the helipad first. 

The game starts with all players on a deserted town square. Each turn, you roll a d6 for movement and move through the city, playing cards to help yourself or screw your opponents. New tiles are revealed and placed when you move off a tile you're at. On the tiles is listed how many Zombies you spawn, how many bullits and hearts there are. 

Combat is dead easy and happens each time you are in the same location as a zombie. You roll a die, if you roll a 4+, you kill the zombie. If you roll less than 4, you can discard bullets to get a +1 on your roll. If you don't manage, you lose a lifepoint (heart). If you ever lose all your life you respawn at the city center, but lose half your zombies.

Zombies is, like I said, a classic. I am not sure if time has been kind to it. The game is an ultra light, take-that kind of screw your buddy game. It's fun though, although it can run a little long. I prefer this to Munchkin.

RATING: 2.7
The game is simple enough: roll dice to move and kill zombies, and either whoever kills 25 zombies first or reaches the helipad first wins. Unfortunately, the simplicity is in no way an enhancement to the experience of playing. The only enjoyable aspect I can see in the game is getting into the role-playing idea of being in a zombie apocalypse, which is helped a lot by the clever animations on the cards and tiles. Still, this by no means offsets the unnecessary length of each game (seriously, an average 4 player game takes longer than any zombie movie I know of) nor the repetitive gameplay, which pretty much consists of killing zombies and trying to find uses for the cards. The worst part of the game is when the helipad is revealed because the game naturally devolves into a "go after the person winning" strategy which involves all the other players unleashing all their bitch-move cards on the near-winner; usually this continues until someone kills 25 zombies (which, considering the 50% chance dice rolls, takes a VERY long time...) Do yourself a favor and play "Last Night On Earth" - you won't regret it.

RATING: 6.75
Played this one a few times, and it ends up being fun every time. 

The mechanics are far from sound. Games mostly comprise a lot of chaotic running around and random tile-laying. It's thus far worked out that the bravest player has been the winner.

I think there are perhaps too many tiles in the standard deck. It doesn't take long before the board is so overrun with zombies that there's no way you'll reach the new tiles, even if you wanted to (which you probably wouldn't).

In the future, I'll look into existing variants, to try to balance some of the chaos.

If you play with the quick(er) rules variant, this game is a ton of fun.  It's a fun hack n' slash game where zombies pile up in front of your character by the dozens.  It's overwhelming at times, but then I imagine going up against a ton of zombies would be.  This game is not meant to be taken too seriously - too many dice rolls and happening to be in the right spot and the right time can really influence this game.  But it's fun, and it comes with a 100 zombies.  Unfortunately, 100 zombies isn't enough, but oh well.  I recommend this game. (although this seems to be a love it or hate it type game - play test it before buying)

I'm not sure what the designers of this game were thinking. A game of hacking your way through zombies should be quick, humorous, and fun. Instead the game as written is long, uninterseting, and ultimately futile. I've played several times without ever having a "winner" according to the rules. Maybe it's because we played with 5 players, but it took *forever* and we just called it a draw each time. Love the zombie figures though...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I really don't like this game at all, but since many people enjoy it I will expand upon my low rating. As always, it's just my opinion and the game may work for your group. To the scathing criticism, then...

The phases of a turn in Zombies are as follows: 

1) draw random event cards if needed 
2) place a random tile 
3) roll d6 to move, battling zombies en route by rolling a d6 (it doesn't matter which direction you move, since the direction of your destination -- the helipad -- is unknown until the final tile is placed)
4) roll a d6 to move the undead (and it doesn't matter much where you move them, since the other players can move them as as well)
 
At some point in the turn you may play / discard / activate event cards. 

It should be apparent from the turn description above that the only real choices in the game are which cards to play and which to discard; literally everything except the card play rests on a strong random element. Sadly, the cards themselves are unbalanced, and when combined with the roll-and-move mechanism, give the game the feel of Snakes and Ladders. Sample cards include 'go back to the start' and 'advance ten spaces'. On top of this, the rules are poorly written and ambiguous. On the upside, the bits are plentiful and of good quality. As Tom Vasel -- or someone -- says, I'm sure there's a great game that can be made with the supplied bits, but the one described in the rulebook ain't it. 

If you manage to massage the rules into shape (probably with the QuickPlay rules from BGG), 3 or 4 is a more accurate rating.

Like Carcassonne, Zombies plays better with few or no expansions and maybe 3 or 4 players. If you go overboard on the players and / or expansions, the game can really drag on -- one 5P game with the Mall Walkers expansion took us 3.5 hours.

Not a bad game at all, but it drags a little long for what it is. This will be perfect if it lasts 45 minutes. It is the typical "take that" kind of game in which after a couple of hours someone manages to win because nobody had the cards to stop him/her. So, it is a game of staying there, near the victory, to make your move hoping that nobody find the right card to spoil your plans. And yes, the best moves, those that seems inbeatable, are taken down over and over again. The ride is nice, some minor dose of strategy is present, but at the end it is just another kind of lottery.You don't necesary will love this game, but if you don't like it, you are going to hate it.

RATING: 5
One of the first zombie games out there.  The game is only mediocre, but the QuickPlay rules from BGG is a must if you want this to be an even remotely fun game.  Otherwise, it's just pointless dice rolling.  The art is wonderful and the theme is definitely there, but too often you find yourself spending the entire game looking for a single card that you'll never get.  From a beer-and-pretzels standpoint, though, it's certainly not so bad that it won't come out once in a while.

I love build-a-map games with miniatures! Zombies!! is the almost perfect apex of this "genre." It feels like a zombie movie, right down to the human characters screwing each other over while the mass of zombies close in. Plus all those zombies on the map look downright impressive. Play it with some slight rules tweaks (weapons are found in locations and give players a little more health and ammo to start with) and you've got yourself a fun hour!

Previously -  Cool theme, great bits and art but no sense of real purpose to the play after multiple playings. I bought Zombie Corps(e) and Z v3.5 to try to resurrect interest but they don't add enough bang for the buck. For the same investment I coulda got a better sci-fi/horror game, I think.

I bought the 2nd edition mostly for the minis to use with my Dawn of the Dead over sized map print outs. Ever now and then I get the idea that I can make a decent game out of Zombies, though. I don't feel too bad I had a $10 Gift Certificate.

RATING: N/A
Arrived Sep-15-2007. Got it mainly for the zombie pieces, so I can play Dead of Night. I thought I should at least play one solitaire game before stealing its pieces, so I did, and I was surprised to find the game was even worse than I anticipated. The rules are a sham. The game fails to capture the feeling of fighting a zombie horde (or at least, the kind of zombie movie *I* enjoy). Plus it's too bloody long! Zombies, although numerous, are mere annoyances and not scary in any way. I concede that the cards are nice, but they can't salvage the experience. It seems like everyone who enjoys this game and lauds it also plays it with their own set of house rules. In a sense, that's why I'm doing, by using DoN as the house rules. If I were the kind of person to give a rating to a game after one solitaire play, it would be a 4. Would much much rather play Last Night on Earth.

Been wanting this game for years.  It doesn't require a whole lot of skill, or strategy, but basically pure luck.  Still a favorite on game nights due to the fast pace of the game and how most games are usually under two hours.  There are also at least ten more expansions for this game and I plan on getting a few of them.

Rating based on a 6-player game that lasted 4 hours. Fun for the first 45-60 minutes but monotonous after that. Roll-and-move games should end quickly in my opinion. But the theme is great and the components are cool. I like how neat the city looks when it's filled with zombies.

Playing it is annoying, because you have to make the board as you go with lots of crappy tokens. Very few decisions to make, almost totally random. I don't even think they fit the theme that well, beyond the minis and the artwork. There are better games of this type. I would suggest Mall of Horror for a better zombie-themed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun to play maybe once or twice. Too long to be filler, and suffers from 'Munchkin syndrome' where the end of the game gets a little drawn out. Good flavor and the art ties in really well with the style, I'd recommend this as a light gateway game but there's not much else to it.

RATING: 4
As a multi-player game, this one is seriously flawed.  Even with significant tweaking (which is essential), it just isn't a smooth play.  I hate placing the bullet and health tokens on the map.  Poor design.  I have played it solitaire numerous times, and if you use some house-rules to add complexity and specific scenarios to the game (which the authors actively encourage), you can have a good time on a Sunday afternoon.  

The expansions are overpriced and generally don't add a lot (I have the mall).  There's a soft spot in my heart for this game because of the evocative card artwork, but I wish it was more than it is.

In order to enjoy this game, one has to approach it with the mindset that it's more like a toolkit than a complete, solid game. i.e. one has to be willing to tweak it in order to bend it into playable shape.

RATING: 8.5
Great miniatures, high degree of replayability owing to the unique modular board design, superb and gruesome art and just like you would expect the game quickly devolves into a full blown zombie apocalypse. On the downside the game has a rather simplistic combat system, sometimes it hard to tell where building exits are and games can stretch for hours if the helipad gets buried beneath several dozen zombies. Still this game and all it's varied expansions is a blast to play!

I hear Last Night on Earth (and Zombie Plague) is a better zombie game.

This one falls a little flat, and we always run out of zombies in the middle of the game.  We've recently purchased the bag-o-zombies, and we hope this makes the game a little more exciting.

Update: The Bag O Babes does help a little.  Game still leaves something to be desired.

[1 play] Sorely disappointed that I wasted my money on this. Last game purchase on which I got burned badly - because I discovered the usefulness of heeding BGG ratings shortly after.

We've all seen movies that spent too much on special effects and had no budget left for a decent scriptwriter and good actors? Didn't those movies really suck? Well, this game is one of those movies.

Hey, can I have my money back with punitive damages for wasted time ?

I eBay'ed this dreck in '03.

RATING: 5
The game has great theme and faithfully mimics the Zombie movies we all love. The setup of the board is fantastic and one gets a sense of doom when zombies start appearing. However, even with the current unofficial quick play rules, the game tends to bog down to a crawl once the board has been setup. The lead player going to the helipad will get hammered by other players who will inevitably swarm him with Zombies. Ouch. 

An additional suggestion would be to make it 3-6 to kill Zombies. This makes the game move along at a faster clip and makes zombie killing a more viable strategy.

RATING: 7
Nothing deep here. Kill zombies! Great fun.

RATING: 6
This was almost a great game. The theme is great, and the components are great, but the actual gameplay tends to feel repetitive. Too many of the items are difficult to actually get into play, and too many of the other cards slow down play simply by thwarting opponents. That's unfortunate, because the cards have the best potential to make this game interesting, but the cards also slow the game down, especially when they cause some players to suffer analysis paralysis. Still, I enjoyed this game enough to buy every single expansion so far.

Docked an extra point because I really wanted to like a game where half of the box is a Zombie Bin. Overlong, repetitious, empty of interesting game concepts or much humor (Come on!

RATING: 6
OK, this game has taken alot of crap and honestly- its probably all true. BUT after playing it a couple of times I keep finding myself saying "gee, I would like another game of Zombies".

Cons: REALLY CRAPPY rules. The rules are just glossed over with absolutely no clarity.  Give up on the prospect of heavy serious game play (you will enjoy the game more if you do) The map cards are flimsy and I cant see them lasting long (but hey the game was cheap!) and the spacings on the first edition are very very unclear! The worst aspect of this game are its rules.

Pros: Its heaps of fun and especially if you dont take it seriously.  The play cards/action cards are funny and really an opportunity to mess with your mates.   Its pretty easy for first time game players.  Best aspects of this game are the theme (I LOVE zombies) and the action cards ..oo and the little zombie men - try buying the glow ones.

It's fun. It captures the feeling of a zombie apocalypse well. I got it because the tile laying mechanic was unique to me at the time although some games we've had to end without a winner because no one could reach the helicopter or 25 zombies.

RATING: 3
Totally not as bad as it should be.  It is thematically entertaining, and it works well for what it is.  It doesn't feel like just another take that card game.  But there isn't much here other than roaming around and rolling dice.

The grinding through all the same zombies does get monotonous and getting around the map takes forever.  Often the cards limit your movement, have other players return you to a dead end or cause you to lose a turn.  I think a game that injects friction on that level is suffering from a weak design.  Were it not for this it still only would rate a 4, but losing a turn (possibly multiple turns) or having your actions undone is so obnoxious that I'm dropping the rating by a point.

The Zombie figs are awesome though.

There are only two options hope you get lucky with lots of good rolls killing zombies. Lots of good rolls=25 good rolls.

Or...

Stay in last place, so you can place the Helipad near you to win.

[b]The most winning strategy is staying in last place? Yep.[/b]

If you have the cards [i]The Keys Are Still In It[/i] and [i]Alternate Food Source[/i], just wait by whoever is in last place (hopefully you) for the helipad and victory to show up.

I read your box and thought, "This is it, this is finally the game where hordes of zombies will hunt me and my friends down, overcoming my (very weak) willful suspension of disbelief and haunting my dreams", plus there are all those cool zombies!  But you weren't that, Zombies, you could've been so much more, instead you'll be parts for another game.  Hope you did good on the physics final and have a good summer.

Our first foray into "specialty" games (i.e. not a standard Milton Brothers game) and it has remained an all time fave! Two ways to win (either by getting to the chopper or killing a bunch of zombies) and a HUGE game area that changes EVERY time you play make this one hell of a game! Either 2 players, or more, there is ALWAYS fun to have. Plus, the many expansions add so many more elements to the game making it even better!!

This game is really hard to rate. The rules themselves are awful (very long and exhausting game, which is completely luck-based), but the miniatures and other stuff are absolutely awesome for the price. View it as a box of miniatures and board tiles and this is perfect for you, see it as a game and you will suffer.

Almost worth owning just for the art on the cards, but as a game, this is broken. Maybe it's in keeping with the theme that the players have little to do except wander aimlessly, but there's just no fun in it. The nub of the problem is that you can never feel that you are making any progress toward a goal or even making decisions that might have some effect on the outcome -- why go down one street rather than another, and why shuffle around zombies here rather than there? You can't even hope for a few lucky rolls that will provide a quick escape from the tedium.

This game is a blast when you have a bunch of players, as they are all trying to screw each other over all the time. Plus, since the rules are so dang easy, there is a lot of fun smack-talking. It seems essential to get the FAQ from the company's website, as a lot of cards raise a lot of questions and the docs are a little too short. But all-in-all, a bunch of mindless fun!

Rating based on one play. There's not much to the game - roll a die for a 50% chance of killing a zombie - and there's definitely a question about reasonable strategies.

Revised rating from 5 (2009) to 6 (2011).

Great beer and pretzels game. Those who are fans of Munchkin i.e. Those who do not let broken rules phase them, tend to be drawn to this sort of game.

This game is just all random dice rolls.  On your turn you place a tile and place elements on that tile.  Zombies, hearts (which represent your life and let you re-roll), and bullets (which let you add 1 to a roll).  Then you roll to move and subsequently roll to defeat any zombies you encounter with a 50/50 shot.

Very.  Boring.  The game does have items that let you move extra spaces or hit harder in combat or even hinder your opponents.  The win condition is a race to either get to the helipad or kill 25 zombies.  There are so many zombie horde killing games out there that do what this game tries to do so, so much better that you can pretty much ignore this one.

Use shorter game rules: The chopper is shuffled into the bottom half of the deck. The person with the least ammount of Zombies places the chopper. After chopper out, roll 2 die for movement. Other Variants: Movement = life tokens + 2. If you end your movement on the center of Town Square, you can fill up to 3 lives and 3 bullets. You always move 3 zombies at the end of your turn. Your movement is doubled if Helipad is on the table.

Fun for a groups, lighthearted fun, but can be very frustrating, also.

Other cards are too worthless to make them worth going out of your way to achieve.

Looking at the compact box and the interesting tiles and minis that it contains, it would be easy to assume that they are all part of an interesting little game.

At its bare bones it's solid, but boring - requires severe use of house rules to make fun.

Tons and tons of random elements to this.  The fewer the players the more strategy.  I have a love-hate affair with this game but there's no question the 100 little zombies that come with it are awesome.  Some are even miscast into even cooler Zombies!!!  Grows more tedious with each replaying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Players place a map tile, spawn zombies, roll to move then roll to move the walking dead, attempting to either reach the helipad (once it's placed) or kill 25 zombies. The elevator pitch is "take-that zombie dicefest". There's a certainly a lot of take that, in the form of cards that either help you or ruin other players' chances, but the luck factor is overwhelming.

As a game, it embodies all that is wrong with the "Ameritrash" school of design; as an activity you can get some laughs out of it.

RATING: 3
The basic premise behind this game holds potential, but in the end the mechanics just don't create a very fun experience.  Essentially the game boils down to a LOT of roll and move/kill and any potential for strategy is stripped away.  I suppose with the right people this game can be fun in a beer and pretzels sort of way, but I have a habit of gaming sober, so it doesn't do much for me.  Others have suggested house rules to spice things up and add some strategy.  I haven't explored those possibilities enough to see if they have merit, but I also haven't been motivated enough to do so.  Ultimately I see this as a game that just isn't that good.

You would need to be a zombie to enjoy this game. Move, roll some dice, get shafted by a card, go back to square one. Repeat ad nauseum. It's one of those tedious "bash the leader" affairs which manages to eke out the game needlessly for the whole evening until you are praying for the game to end. The roll and move mechanic is incredibly dated and tedious. Imagine waiting 5 minutes for your turn to come round only to end up rolling a 1 for your move. Oh well, doesn't matter anyway because another played a card that means you have to miss a turn so may as well sit back and watch the "hilarity" unfold. This might be a fun beer and pretzels game if it didn't drag on for quite so long, and the fact that the first half of the game is spent wandering aimlessly around the map waiting for the helipad to appear. While the theme is great on paper, the game completely fails to capture any of the tension or pathos of the great zombie movies. 

Gave away to charity.

It's end game is characterized by the "bash the leader (until he dies) until everyone runs out of bash the leader cards and someone wins"  

This game could probably be salvaged by a couple variants to speed up play and reduce the leader bashing cards but I'm not about to put that much effort into it.  2008/12/15

It's a fun little game, it's fun fighting in a zombie apocalypse and picking up health and ammo, love screwing your buddy over and sending zombies after him.  And I like how the map unfolds.  But really for one of the millions of zombie games out there it is nothing special.  It is a very samey, game: same tiles, same zombies, and the characters all feel the same.  Really wish there were powerups, maybe the expansions do it I don't know.  But for an overused theme, this game is certainly playable, but nothing special.

A great deal, 30 bucks for over one hundred miniatures, but the game lacks the unique thrill that you get from a zombie movie, because when a player gets in the lead, they stay in the lead, and you're too frusterated to feel anything else. The gameplay is pretty fun, but repetitive, and after the first playthrough it looses it's once seemingly great style. Iwould still recommend it for parties, and the likes.

Good bang for the buck, what with the 100 zombie minis.  Those who complain about the game length should realize that players have total control over that aspect, depending on where you feel like placing the helipad (Last in the tile deck? Within the last 5? In the latter half? Etc.).

Way too long for this type of game. I like the theme, the take that of the cards, but not the movement or some of the luck.

RATING: 3
At the time it came out it was one of the few Zombie horror games out there. The production quality is very high, but the gameplay is downright boring. Rolling dice for movement isn't very fun when it could be more than five turns to actually get anywhere to do anything at all.
Note to designers: Roll and move is a terrible game mechanic unless the game plays fast. Zombies does not. This game is a chore.

Sometimes you go in to a game knowing that you're not going to enjoy it. I've played *a lot* of games in the past few years, but not this one so when it was suggested recently, I agreed, albeit with very, very low expectations.

The map building aspects are pretty underwhelming. Draw a tile and place a tile. The movement is the roll of a D6. Combat is a 50/50 chance. It was apparent as early as my first turn that the best thing to do was to stay still and hope that everybody else died trying to kill 25 zombies.

2 hours later, 2 people had died and 4 of us were slowly working our way to the helipad. Of course, with 14 or so zombies on the three or so tile spaces blocking access to the helipad it was essentially a matter of who decided to suicide themselves on the horde so the others might be able to get through. Let's just pause here to remind ourselves that this IS NOT a co-operative game. Two of the players decided to work as a team and do whatever they could to make sure one of the two of us won. It was the most sensible thing to do and prevented the game running for any longer than it already had.

For some reason my original love of this game has burned out, new players are always drawn to it, but playing it almost feels like a chore.

RATING: 7.6
This game is just purely some good fun. It's entirely luck based but has some nice mechanics (such as the event cards) that leave scope for being really mean to the other players. Easy to pick up and easy to play, this isn't a game for the thinking man but it certainly drips with flavour.

RATING: 8
Oh, come on.  How can anyone NOT enjoy the endless onslaught of the shambling dead?  You *do* have to work out some quick house rules, though, unless you want every game to take 3 hours.  Still, for gamers who are wont to go "AARRR...rrr...ggh" at the best of times, this is a fun, mindless (literally!) beer-and-pretzels, screw-your-buddy campfest.  We've played it loads, and it's always a giggle.

For a inane dice-fest, this game is actually pretty fun.  The main problem is that it can run on far past the time that it's entertaining.  It can be devastating when the game is almost over, and a bad roll or two dooms a player into losing half his kills.  In the right mindset (light, random, dice-festival, Zombie-splatting) this can be good.

This is a great filler game.  The tongue in cheek subject combines with simple game mechanics for an enjoyable play.  I also like the variable tile system as it make for a different game board each game.  Also the action cards each player receives also add flavor to the play.  My one complaint would be that some games could become bogged down if the game board becomes closed and the last tile (the helipad/escape tile) cannot be played.  Also, a somewhat mature theme that might not be appropriate for some younger players.

I discovered one of them played this before and the next thing I know there are 6 of us playing with 4 more watching and more coming in!

This game can be fun with the right players in the right mood, but it can also be a really long slog to the finish.  If everyone plays to win, there is a lot of "gotcha" going on that will drag everyone who gets close to winning back into the pack.  As long as you approach it in the right spirit, it can be fun.

A solid game idea in desperate, brain-hungry search for house rules. Too long for what it is, fairly random, and put a shotgun to your own skull if you play with more than one expansion at the same time. Still, you can have a decent time if you shorten the game and remove some tiles. Better yet, play Last Night on Earth.

Cool art, cool components, completely underwhelming.  I bought this game back when I was a wee boardgamer, before I learned the importance of checking BGG for info.  Not even sure why I bought it, as I've never been terribly passionate about zombies.  Boggles my mind how this game can have ten thousand expansions.

Not bad, inferior to When Darkness Comes IMO though. End game gets very, very messy with hundreds of Zombies on the board and becomes hard to keep track. A good blast. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a game that I played pretty frequently before I REALLY got into the board gaming hobby.  There are many aspects of the game I like (tile-laying, backstabbing, the feeling of being overrun by the undead), but it just doesn't get to the table at all these days now that I have so many better games.  Perhaps if it wasn't roll-and-move I'd still enjoy it more; too many rolls of 1 and 2 will just bog the game down.  Plus, the game can get kind of boring with 4 or more players, especially if one of those players plays a card to skip your turn.  I'll still play this if somebody REALLY wants, but I won't suggest it myself.

Victory can only be obtained by reaching the helicopter. Zombies are kept as trophies (players are usually pretty proud of their ass-kicking abilities) but have no other meaning. I've heard of some RPG variants, we might try something like that.

This game looks great, has a great sense of humour and an interesting play style that allows for new and interesting maps each time you play. unfortunatly, it takes forever to win, there are no real tactics and everything comes down to who can roll the most 6s in the game. The ganme just misses that essential component- fun.  It has a place in my heart because of the look, and having a town map full of plastic zombies is just amazing, but i never really want to play it because it takes to long and its just not that fun.  My mates and I have experimented with various rules to make it more enjoyable but haven't struck on many.  suggestions welcome.

Fun little game, ya can't really take it too seriously because of all the random "take this" cards that get played on the leader.

The length is just a touch too long for a game of this calibre, but once again I bet there are variants around to fix this as well.

- Roll and move.
- Almost broken endgame (random tile draw can determine the winner)

It promises a lot more that it delivers.  Most of the time, potential players get excited by the theme and get disappointed when its not exactly like a movie.  That said, I still like the whimsical "screw your opponent" nature of it and the zombie movie trope references.

Very Fun game! I like the little Zombie figures! This is a game that you can hinder your opponents while trying to collect 25 Zombies or trying to escape through the streets of the town to get to the Heliport Pad.
  I would change 2 things about this game. 1.) Players should collect 20 Zombies (not 25). I played a 4-player game, and the most anyone got was 19, so 20 could be more attainable.  2.) At least 4 city street cards should be elominated from the deck.  It just seemed we were drawing cards, sometime losing Zombies because we lost a fight and  the game dragged a little until we got the Heliport Card out, and then everyone started to race to that spot to get the game over with!
  But, this was another instant high rated game while I played it the 1st time!

RATING: 6
Now, here's a game with little merit whatsoever. Not much strategy, just die-rolling, movement, and the occasional (frequent) death of a brain-seeking Zombie. That's the clincher, though. The game is brainless, much like its theme, but it's still fun to watch your opponents try and screw you over by filling up the Helipad with zombies in the final turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Gameplay becomes quickly repetitious. Boils down to: Roll the die to fight a zombie. 1-3, you win, 4-6 you lose. Whoopee.

RATING: 3
I would love to love this game, as its theme is perfect and components are inspiring. Unfortunately, the game is a pure luckfest and hardly offers a challenge beyond that. Even so, it could have been a perfect filler were it not for the extensive playing time. Even with the variant rules offered on this site, it just drags on and on and on.

I played this for the first time at Origins 04.  The game didn't quite finish in time, so the two of us that were left just compared cards, decided we were about even, and tossed a die to decide.  I lost, and the stakes turned out to be a $10 gift certificate.  It is a good game that is supported by an appropriately simple system.  If my group starts playing the run-and-gun game I already have (Frag), I will probably pick this one up sometime.  Note:  I ended up getting this cheap at an auction, but it hasn't hit the table yet.

RATING: 3.5
There is something just plain wrong about a zombie apocalypse where the survivors' primary goal is to hunt down zombies.  Player action choices are too few.  Low movement rates, collecting tokens and action cards combined means there really isn't that much to do, I've already described 90% of the game!  The other 10% of the game is using action cards to *hurt* other players (i.e. preventing them from winning), which causes everyone's agony to be lengthened.

This game is very good because it is simple to explain to newbies.  Those who have been exposed the first time have liked it.  It generates replay requests, so that's a good sign.  The game can start to run long when a helipad takes awhile to come out (I don't put it at the bottom of the pile).  But overall it is a party favourite.

Zombies is a fun little game that I've enjoyed playing. It's long since been eclipsed by bigger, better games though, so I'm not sure if I would enjoy playing it again or not. It's certainly not a bad game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Brutal. Not a round went by without me going "What was the designer thinking?"

First, the goals in this game are almost opposite of what they should be. It's a competitive game and feels more like Deer Hunter than zombie survival. You win by either killing 25 zombies first or reaching the helipad. Since reaching the helipad is almost entirely dominated by luck (whoever is closest to where it's placed has a huge advantage), the strategy is basically "open season on zombies". Yes, you actually want to actively go after and hunt down the zombies. You get to roll for both your player movement and zombie movement, and it's not uncommon to make the zombies attack yourself for more chances to get points (zombie kills). This would be OK if the theme was more like a comedy zombie scenario (i.e. Zombieland or Sean of the Dead), but it's tailored to be horror. Yes, oh no, you spawned a bunch of zombies in the building I'm in, I'm horrified... free points!

I guess there can theoretically be a point in time where strategy comes into play and someone could be wanting to run away and get supplies rather than fight zombies, so then you could hinder instead of help them. Probably as you reach the ridiculous amount of 25 zombies needed is when this would become more prominent (as you lose half if you die). There's also a lot of goofy "take that" action cards that simply remove someone's zombie cache and puts them back into play which don't help the game at all from a fun/strategy perspective.

The tiles you reveal are bland, which isn't helped by the location-based action cards almost never working or being worth it. The other actions are "take that", which is almost the only form of player interaction because the "now you get to attack other players with zombie" phase is actually the "move zombies closer to you so you can kill them first" phase. Turns take forever because of the ridiculous tile/hit/bullet/zombie placement.

I had more fun trying to stack the zombie miniatures than I did playing the actual game. Avoid like the plague!

Probably shouldn't rate after one play, but that one play left such a bad taste in my mouth.  I was initially looking forward to the game because I love exploring tiles.  I thought the gameplay was light, but cheeky and I was having a good enough time... then 3+ hours passed.  We were stuck in a seemingly infinite loop as the cards cycled and whenever anyone got close to escaping through the exit, the card came back up that sent that person back to the start again.  I've never wanted to get out of a game more in my life.

If the words "Umbrella Corp," or "Raccoon City" mean anything to you, this game will be a dream-come-true for you.  It's a madhouse Romero-style survival-horror battle royale with more twists and turns than you you can safely handle during one sitting.  Got a few kinks in it, but with the right group you'll be having WAY too much panicked fun to notice!

Ok, so 1 star is too harsh.  It's more like a 2, because the game is in fact playable, but I just want to emphasize you should not buy this game.  It came out in 2001 and that really shows.  The roll to move feature mean that about 1/3 of the time you will be moving either 1 or 2 spaces.  The game makes little to no sense how you are competing against each other to survive a zombie apocalypse.  And that only one person can make it to the chopper and survive, and that you can apparently fly a helicopter without issue.  Are we a group of trapped helicopter pilots?  Also, the combat is uninteresting.  Roll about a 3 to win, roll below to lose.  And worst of all, the game length is brutal, it's over an hour of this 1 game mechanic.

This is so much cooler than a pink ribbon. Keep fighting the good fight Todd! As you can see, I kind of hate your game...but I came into the hobby from a completely different direction than many new gamers, who share your obvious love of zombies. Your game has drawn in a tremendous amount of people into the hobby, which says a whole lot more than any opinion coming out of my mouth. Get well, you've got a lot of people waiting for Zombies!!! 87: Attack of the Harlem Shaking Zombie Munchkins. ~ Jeff
(Posted during the rate Zombies a 10 drive to support Todd's fight against Cancer. :( )

Zombies!!! is almost as popular as Munchkin and almost as bad of a game. The basic framework is functional enough. Place a tile, pick up some cards and waste some zombies. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there. The combat system is so simplistic that it makes the game painfully repetitive and manages to feature almost every type of game mechanic that I hate. Gotcha! cards that prevent the leader from ever winning, Death penalties that are so severe it's like starting the whole game over and a win condition that is almost one hundred percent random. It's like this game was built specifically for me to hate.

Shoot this thing in the head and go buy Last Night on Earth already...

Don't expect an in-depth plot or complicate rules and drawn-out turn sequence ... It's classic back-stabbing and survival ... and there are zombies!

RATING: 5.5
Players must get to the Helipad or kill 25 zombies to win. Before the Helipad is out, each player places a new town tile and zombies. There is a lot of screw-your-neighbor cards in the game, which can make it easy to slow down others who are ahead or practically kill off others. This, combined with lots of chance, can make for a long game with few strategic possibilities.

I think this was the first geeky board game I ever bought, I had never seen anything so cool in a board game before - I have come along way since then...

The game in actually pretty crap, it is very luck driven and drags very badly. It's fine as a silly thing to do with friends over some drinks but the novelty wears off quickly.

*

Including the following expansions:

Zombies!!! 2: Zombie Corps(e)
Zombies!!! 3: Mall Walkers
Zombies!!! 3.5: Not Dead Yet
Zombies!!! 4: The End...
Zombies!!! 5: School's Out Forever
Humans!!!

(Did I really buy all that, before I realised there was so much better gaming to spend my money on?)

My rating is purely biased toward my experience with the game and my enjoyment with my friends. This score should not be compared to my other ratings if you are trying to compare games. If I really had to rate the game to compare to the rest of the games on this list it'd be a 6.

Zombies!!! is a game that starts of with plenty of gusto and then slowly winds down as the board increases and as resources deplete. This is the real mood-killer of the game...you would think play would get more tense and exciting as more zombies emerge and as players are racing to collect trophies but such is not the case. By the final stretch of the game, the tedium and sluggish pace start to wear on the nerves. It's worth noting, however, that I've not played any later editions of Zombies!!! and thus can't speak to whether these issues have been addressed. House rules for more card-play and a few additional options could certainly help this game be a better experience.

Fun little game if you like theme games and thinking about hacking zombies apart, collecting weapons, and screwing your friends by putting them in a field of zombies that come out of the woodwork.

Fun, light game.  Gameplay is good with the theme, and the bits are nice.  It takes a long time to play ... but what do you expect with 100 shuffling zombies?  The length of time is my only negative comment about the game (although the artwork and theme keep this from being a game for kids); for such a simple, fun game I'd expect it to be shorter.

The artwork is OK but nothing special.  Unfortunately the board tiles don't quite match in colour when you put them together which makes the "city" look disjointed.  The character pieces are average, but it's still a fun romp which soon picks up once there are hordes of zombies on the board.  It's quite simple, although would be better if some of the cards could be used at more locations.

RATING: 3
This was one of the few Zombie games available at the game store when I bought it.  It wasn't great then, and it definitely hasn't fared well through the recent board game renaissance this past decade.  

First, I really like tile laying games.  I really like Zombies.  I like chance games.  This seemed like it would be a good fit.  The problem with it is how it ends.  The person with the lowest zombie count gets to place the helipad when it appears.  This means that often they can place it right next to them and win while others are on the other side of the map.  Annoying.  

Several of the special cards only work if you are in a specific building which is really hard to ever get there so the card is useless.  Thematically great, but painful and pointless when playing.  Just throw those cards away because they aren't very likely to help you at all.  

There are times in the game when it makes more sense to die than live so you can start over from the fountain.  Silly thematically and annoying if someone uses this to win over what was your dominate position.  Lame.  

Players really are against each other rather than for each other, which again, seems rather silly for a Zombie outbreak where the few survivors would probably stick together, at least until they were a bit more in the clear.  

If you are looking for a Zombie game, go for Zombicide (tactical minis) or Dead of winter (strategic/betrayal/thematic).  Both are better games than this.  I only play this game when my nieces come over and they don't want to commit to longer game (like Zombicide) or they just feel like killing things with no consequence or thought.

An interesting premise for any zombie lover but with the same game play mechanics as games similar to Risk (i.e. dice dependency). On another parallel with Risk, Zombies!!! lacks the depth of other games. On top of event cards (one of the few redeeming qualities of the game), the only thing you yourself can do is move. Because of the long playtime, I suggest avoiding it completely and just simply playing Carcassonne.

It's a fun 'screw-your-neighbors' kind of game.  Obviously, that's not a play style that suits everyone, but if you are looking for a good beer-and-pretzels, laugh-and-holler type of game experience, this qualifies.  ESPECIALLY if everyone likes the more comedic zombie movies, the quotes and circumstances that come up really liven the match.

Honestly, the biggest problems with the game are that it really does require the right (very drunk) audience, and it unquestionably overstays its welcome.  If the game ended, somehow, when the last tile was placed, it could work okay...but often times, that feels like about the halfway point of the game, and it can just DRAG ON from there.

Its simple, its easy to teach, and above all its a ton of fun. There are some rules that prohibit game play, but I just substitute my own for a better game. Many times I find it hard to get people to play certain games that have very stereotyped themes, like d&d, or magic the gathering, yugioh, warmachine, etc... but I don't really face that with zombies!!! most of the population has seen a zombie flick within the past year or so, so they find it easy to relate and just have a good time. a very good casual game

There's not much game here, and it's highly luck dependent, but you could argue that zombie flicks aren't exactly classic movies either.  ;)

[b]A RIGHT GOOD ZOMBIE-KILLING ROMP IN GLORIOUS B-MOVIE TRADITION, FEATURING PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUNS & BUZZING CHAINSAWS![/b]

I really like this game. It's a tile-laying, card-playing, dice-rolling action game, that doesn't take itself very seriously. But it is a toolkit. Accept it. I would score this a 5 or a 6 if I was using the clunky, confusing official rules bundled with the box. We only ever play using my house rules - the rules out of the box stink like zombie-flesh; dragging the game into the small hours if played with 4+ gamers, especially with arguments started over timing issues caused by the ill-worded, but fantastically illustrated, event cards. This should not put players off, because the theme is so great, and the rules so easy to change, that it is worth persevering with this little gem. Even the game's designers admit that Zombies, out of the box, is the seed that can be planted to grow into your own style of game system. We have always had FUN playing this game, and that's the main aim of boardgaming, isn't it? But, boy, does this game take a battering to the head, with a blood-stained cricket bat, on the Geek! 

If you like zombie movies and the Resident Evil videogames, then this game can suit your needs. The premise is simple, like most cool, zombie flicks: some dudes are in imminent danger of having the flesh ripped from their bones by hordes of lurching zombies, and must fight to get to a helicopter and escape. Screwing over the other players on the way is a good strategy and also a chucklesome pastime.

[b]Q: How does this compare to Last Night on Earth?[/b]
[b]A:[/b] Okay. LNoE has superior production values, gimmicky photoshopped cards, and also great big tileboards. That's all fine and dandy. However, Zombies has the better themic fit for my money. Urban zombie scenarios always trump zombie farmhands attacking steadings, IMHO. How many zombie flicks feature farms over, say, a mall? Not many. I have a fondness for building up a doomed town and exploring on the run, rather than having it all laid out at the beginning. You lose that "what's coming up next?" factor. Zombies also has the better artwork on the cards. Fact.

[i]Having said all that, to really enjoy this game do the following polishes:[/i]

1. Throw out the rulebook.
2. Pick and choose from the variant rules on the Geek - remember to keep it SIMPLE!
3. Do not lay down tiles after finding the helipad.
4. Forget counting "dead" zombies for the winner - this is a kill-the-zombie-to-escape game. Let the most bloodthirst player place the helipad.
5. When a player dies, have him/her/them control the zombies, etc.
6. Trim the card deck to a custom-picked 50-60 cards. NO more, no less. Keep it 50/50 to screwage/benefit cards.
7. Use a timer - this keeps a panicky atmosphere ticking over.
8. Mount the town tiles on 2mm-thick card.
9. Use the subway expansion.

We also feature bosses like RE's Nemesis to spice up the challenge, sometimes. I also bought a set of REAL 9mm bullets to replace the tokens - talk about game-pimping!

The game is a blast with the right crowd. It can also be a breath of fresh air after playing El Grande or Puerto Rico. BRAINNSSS!

[b]Tips for the game designers to ignore:[/b]

1. Keep the artist: he's brilliant.
2. Keep the deep game-box.
3. Hire someone to rewrite the rules, and the fuzzy wordage on the cards.
4. Have the tiles made of thicker card.

Yuck.  Just not my cup of tea.  The zombie art and figures are fine if you like that sort of thing... but the game itself is dull and entirely luck based... roll better and/or draw the right city tile and you win! :shake:

I didn't have high expectations prior to playing this game, because TC has a reputation to produce games that are extremely awkward, incomplete, etc.  This game though is definitely fun, albeit random, but I enjoyed it each time I played it - this was a pleasant surprise!

The components are what to be expected as all TC games are virtually the same in regards to components.  They are pretty well done and very durable.  I like the artwork in this game.

The gameplay, as I mentioned, can be redundant and definitely random!  Since your success highly relies upon die rolls, luck is a major issue here.  There will always be those players that roll extremely well and those who do not... this is to be expected.

Prior to playing the game, I already knew what to expect and so taking all into account, I did enjoy playing Zombies!!!  I am very happy to add it into my ever-growing collection and it is a well-welcomed addition!

I hate zombie games.  This one gets a low rating for the following reasons:

1) winning is almost completely luck

2) cards don't add much in my opinion

3) the game can drag on for eternity

Need a filler game?  How about anything else?

Can be pretty fun with zombies spawning everywhere, but felt a little luck-of-the-roll to me. It also goes on for far too long and is prone to king-of-the-hill bashing. Last Night on Earth handled this a little better.

Great game, but it lacks some finesse with winning. With the original rules, the guy who places the heliport tile like wins, or has a great advantage. Anyways, with some rule tweaks, it's great fun.
Upgraded to an 8. I really like this game, I really do. Out of the box it's a 7 for me, but with some rules adjustments, it's an 8. And I rate the games for what they become when I own them.

Whatever you regard this game as, it has had an important impact on the board game market, and it was with a sad heart that I learned that its creator Todd Breitenstein passed away in cancer March 24th, 2013. Rest in peace, Todd.

I have this and a few of the expansions, but I can't remember which ones. Zombies!!! actually came out like, slightly ahead of the huge Zombie cultural obsession curve. 

It's a tile-based dungeon crawl (or survival-horror crawl, I guess) to gain supplies and get to the helipad to win. You can help or harm other players as you like, or as gameplay dictates. 

It's been a LONG time since I've played this. It's an old game so it's kind of fallen out of popularity, which is a shame. It's still super fun. Plays 4 or 5 players - maybe more with the expansions. One of the expansions has glow-in-the-dark irradiated zombies, and I think another has zombie dogs.

Standard roll and move affair with a handful of nicely illustrated cards thrown into the mix which spice up the proceedings.

Basically, land on a square with a zombie and kill it on a roll of 4-6. Kill 25 of these, or reach a helicopter pad and you win.

Most of the cards are difficult to bring into play, as you need to be in a certain location to acquire them, and a few of the cards are open to interpretation due to poor wording and a lacking rulebook. But nail down most of these issues and you'll at least get some fun out of it. Just don't expect an in-depth game where you need to exercise your noggin.

I own this and most the expansions, and I love it. Been playing this game for years. But getting it to the table is a feat of strength in itself. Never have i Played a game that gets blood boiling so quickly, forces people to stew in selfishness and hatred so deeply. Bring your hate game because arguments will happen and tempers will get elevated. I love every minute of it, but those I play with don't, so a 5 because no one will play with me.

P.S. the arguments can get heated and brutally stupid-mean, but once victory is claimed by someone it all seems to go away, so it isn't long lasted, just detested in the moment. Enjoy!

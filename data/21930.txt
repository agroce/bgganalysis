RATING: 5.5
Fast paced game with all players playing as fast as possible trying to get a chain of player cards that lead to a goal, but beware cause there is but one pile for all teams so chains can be easily broken with the leading chain leading to taking a goal instead. A slight steep learning curve with this one in order to get accustomed to the teams deck. Only complaint: the players' numbers didn't stand out through the cards artwork which given the pace of the game is bothersome, making the game more difficult to learn. all in all though, fast enough game that you do not really care. Not an every-day game for me but I can see myself playing it from time to time, with the correct company.

Something in the lines of Flix Mix but this is a partnership game which is cool becuase it adds to the competetivness. Football theme adds to the fun too. With less than 4 when it loses it's partnership aspect there is much less fun.

The best quick real time game. Requires much more skill than it first seems. Definitely better to play in 2 or 3 player teams.

+ quick
+ fun to discover that it's not as random as it looks
+ plays good with any number of players
+/- when you play in teams it will be loud

Kaikki pelit BSW:ssä. Täysin väsynyt totaalinen tuuripeli. Joskin ehkä sadasta pelistä "nopeampi" pelaaja voittaa hieman useammin kuin "hitaampi". Mutta siis ei mitään järkee. (13.5.2009)

This game was very random.  Perhaps there is a little more strategy after you gain experience, but it wasn't much fun.  Not being able to play out of your hand ("draw pile") is frustrating when you're so used to being able to do it in Ligretto.

Ligretto for Team Players, thereby eliminating the entry hurdle for newbies somewhat, who are often annoyed by being hopelessly lost amongst expert players.However, it is much more difficult to read all the information on the cards quickly enough.

Overly long speed pattern matching game considering its simplicity. I was just praying for it to end.

For simplistic speed pattern matching games, both SET and Blink are better. For longer speed pattern matching games, JAB has a lot more depth.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2011)

Crazy Kick is a real time party game which I enjoy. The reason I haven’t buy it yet is that the cards suffer a lot during the frantic game play, even with sleeves and that’s too hard for me. The rules are very easy to teach and it plays very fast with any number of players. I prefer to play it with an even number of players. When we played it the screams were very loud, they were so loud we bothered some neighboring tables, buts it was a blast. I think the player who scream the most have an advantage communicating what is needed to the whole team, and it that regard my SO scream the most by far :D.

A female friend lost two nails last time we played it and some of us were scratched :D.

I feel the game has some strategy to it which is very good.

I’m downgrading its rating because Crazy Kick is not a game I would want to play very often, besides, now I rate games much more harshly than before.

Light, but not without strategy (keep a scoring card on one of your stacks, along with a player that can pass the ball to the scoring player, etc.).

Great fun, with all the chaos around the table, and people shouting the players' names!

A party game that even works with two, which is exceptional.

Sure, it's totally random, totally reflex/luck based, and it's just a bunch of cards...but it's FUN.  Everyone I've introduced it to loves it.  Especially teens and kids at church...if I ever pull out the Ligretto box, I'm sure to have a 4v4 match set up in an instant with a couple of kids hanging around waiting for someone else to leave.

I played the Polish version "Futbol Ligretto".  Very fast silly simultaneous card play, ostensibly simulating a football match.  Basically just fast reactions and luck.  Fun for a silly filler game, although it seems to only make sense for an even number of players.  (But if the two teams have different numbers of players, who really cares? It's for laughs, not a serious game.)

It seems that the person that draws the goal card first will have the better chance of winning.  Is there more to this?

What utter random crap!

I bought this 'cause I enjoy Ligretto. Mary and I tried it face-to-face 2er, then on BSW with 4. Yuck! It seems totally random! You're just flipping through the deck hoping to get to the card you need at the right moment. I suppose it may be better if you know the team, and who passes to who ... but otherwise this just isn't worth playing!

[Schmidt Spiele 2007 edition] {Football; real-time, partnership, drafting} It's better themed than other Ligretto edition.  The rule is a little bit different: there is only 1 target in the middle of table and 1 team wins by scoring 5 goals (not clear their hands).  It is more similar to multi-player "Speed".

The cards are sturdy. The illustration is colorful, I like it.

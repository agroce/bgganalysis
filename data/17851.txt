We play it once, maybe twice every football season.  To be honest, it feels like you're playing what could've been a cheap handheld computer game, but sometimes ya just gotta have your dice-fest.  Plays out in a realistic-like, satisfying way and is a pretty neat design....there's just not enough here to warrant a lot of table-time....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of fun. Not a lot of strategy, in its basic form, other than choosing a run, a short pass, or a long pass and guessing right for defense. My 11 year old loved it (and beat me 27 to 14).

Actually pretty fun for as simple as it is.  Wish it was easier to make big plays on defense.  Full games take longer than they are worth but they can be shortened.

RATING: 5
  It's an interesting simulation of a football game.  But, that's about it - everything is controlled by the dice.  Your choices make a small impact of the out come.  A good sim, but a poor game - try card football for a good football game.

RATING: 6
Light, fun dicefest. It would be nice if the modifiers for each team (in the expansion) made more of a difference in the outcome of a play. All I've played so far is a full professional game with the expansion cards and it does run a bit long for me and begins to get repetitive after a quarter or two. The time mechanic is nicely done however and adds some tension to a close game. I probably would never play the game without the expansions since it seems that limiting the offense and defense to 3 plays each would be silly.

RATING: 7
This is a strategic football game that uses dice and charts to resolve the outcomes of plays.  Play calling is simplified so that you don't have to know a real NFL playbook to play effectively.  It's not the dicefest you would think it would be considering every play is a roll - a defensive call modifies the roll, and the offense rolls on of three charts depending on the type of play.  Dice are used cleverly, such as sometimes being "open-ended" and sometimes being "closed," to keep the pace quick and exciting.

This is essentially Rock-Paper-Scissors with dice and excitement.  If you can't get over randomness, this ain't the game for you.  However, if you love football, if you can really get into the theme, this game can be tremendously exciting.  I really need to try the expansions now.

This game gets a decent rating based almost purely on theme. I wish there was a great football board game, but I haven't found one. This game does a decent job of creating the tension of trying to outguess your opponent, but it is ultimately a little dull and overly luck-dependent.

RATING: 8
A very simple rock-paper-scissors style of play calling directs you to the proper charts to get your play results.  Play moves very quickly, but with realistic results.  

Plays aren't specific, but you choose a play category (run, short pass, long pass) for both offense and defense which gives a defensive modifier to the offense's result roll.  

Guess right, and you'll have some effect on the outcome.  Guess wrong, and you might get burned.  

Good fun - even the full-length professional game takes just 90 minutes.

I really tried to like this game.  I played with and without the expansion.  I played with several different opponents.  I eventually gave up.

I just don't see how your decisions matter enough to drastically affect the outcome of the game.  Also, the full game, which is really the only game I'd be interested in, has a low depth to length ratio.

Played this game with a sort-of non-gamer friend, though he likes baseball and sports in general, so I thought it might be fun.  Well... it was fun, I guess, but there just didn't seem much to it; just a rules-laiden, dice-rolling version of rochambeau.

RATING: 5
Good capture of football, the games act as a real game should.  The decisions to make are limited however and this fact limits the strategy severely.  Still it is fun on occasion and very easy to explain to someone even if they have never played games before.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The only decision making is the defense guessing which of three plays the offense will call. The game is simply rolling dice to find the results of three plays: run, short pass, long pass. Even the possible defensive modification to the offensive play are found with a dice roll. A mindless dice fest posing as a game of strategy.

Rated a "1" for claiming have to "gritty realism." 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Yes, there are a lot of dice, but the designers built a lot of statistical realism into the outcomes.  It is a kind of glorified rock, scissors, and paper but still fun.  With games like Bowl Bound and Paydirt unlikely to come back, there is a need for a game at this level of light medium complexity and high playability.  Additionally, the game gives more options with the expanded teams from the NFL.  I'll try that next and see if the game gets a rating change.  UPDATE: Expansions do improve this game, particularly on defense - but not enough to challenge older, better football games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you don't like looking up die-rolls on charts and referencing a number of different charts to compare results, then run screaming from this game.  However if that is something you like, or at least can tolerate this game is a lot of fun.  There's a nice ebb-and-flow to the game that makes it feel like a real football game.  The scores will generally be fairly realistic (unless someone is amazingly lucky with the dice) and there are mechanisms built in to simulate virtually every moment of an actual football game.

Clearly the designers are huge football fans or they did a lot of homework.  The way that different defenses match against different offenses makes perfect sense.  Then the way results of the die rolls work is also brilliant.  I actually feel like a coach when playing..."Should I go for that long pass and risk a mishap, or should I go for the safer yards and just run it up the gut?"  These are the types of tough decisions you'll have to make during the game.

It plays with a few different variants, so you can play a short game or a full-length game.  It also makes for an entertaining solo experience as you play both sides strictly on offense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The enjoyment of this game is all about expectations.  If you and your uber-game-geek friend who hates dice fests play it, it's going to fall totally flat. BUT, if you pull this game out for your football lovin' casual gamer it will probably be a huge success.  I did the latter.  

My rating is a combined rating: I as a gamer who like a little more depth in my games, but still enjoys a nice dice-fest occasionally give it a 7.  My buddy wanted to play a second game right after the first (and we extended the game to 24 plays per quarter) and was asking where to buy it.  Which equates to a 10.

We also took stats the second game and it worked well, although we did a modified version and kept track of downs too.  It was fun to look over your play selection and drive summaries, and it also was a good way to double-check down and yardage for if you forget to move a peg now and then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Still need to play this more, but so far a cool concept gone bad.  Calling the correct defense doesn't seem to have enough effect, so basically when on D, you are just sitting there hoping your opponent has a bad roll?

Still want to try this again to see if i am wrong, but not promising.

Dice throwing and chart reading fest.  Still my No.1 got to for a bit of football. Rather wish there was some sort of simplication/consolidation of all the charts into one just to speed up the game.  One day I might look to do some DIY on this.

I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.

A well-developed, light football game.  This game works well with those who equate boardgames to "boring game for 8 yr olds".  Which is to say, the game has a topic that will appeal to guys, it's easy to teach, fun to play and encourages smack-talk.

Cons: This game tries to give you control options, but for me, it's just a bunch of dice throwing.

It takes about 15 minutes to realize that rolling dice over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over is not all that much fun.  I have to wonder if the expansions add any strategy to the game because what's there is pretty minimal.

Don't own and haven't played. However, the one copy of this game in my FLGS that appeared on a Friday was snapped up, opened, and played with immediately. Within 30 minutes, both guys were talking smack to each other and enjoying the game tremendously. They roped another convert on Saturday and all three were playing again on Sunday over that one copy. If genuine enthusiasm is any measure, this is a must-have (at least must-try) for football fans of all ages.

One play, it was a dicefest. I've heard the expansions help, but I don't know that I care to try. Especially since I'd probably have to buy the expansion myself. So I'll rate this a 4, with the "could be talked into it" being an opponent who wants to try out their copy of an expansion.

RATING: 6
I actually prefer this to the old Paydirt. It actually allows for a game play that is more realistic - with passing being the dominant offensive play call (with most teams), despite what the defense might do. Nicely done. I like the more seemless play that excludes the penalties.

I'm interested in football but don't know too much about it because soccer is much more popular in Finland. You don't have to know too much about the actual game to enjoy the board game and I really felt like coaching football team. Obviously it's not a simulation but fun nevertheless.

RATING: 4
If you really like football this could be fun.  If not,  it is basically rock-paper-scissors for 1-2 hours - yay.  It is more of a simulator than a game as I find there just aren't enough meaningful decisions.  The events sure do match a real game but you feel more like a spectator than a participant.

Game is easy to learn and quick to assimilate.  I will be curious to see what improvement/adjustment the 2006 expansion game will make to the basic game.  Good impression of play, fun, tense yet not gobs of time and with the shorter games (like the Red Zone) you can play quickly if you have the itch but little time to play.

I don't want to spend my time memorizing charts and flipping through pages and pages of charts.

I was really excited about this one, but it was a severe letdown.  If play calling were more important, it would be kind of cool, but as it stands play calling is secondary to rolling high numbers on D6's.  I can see how this would appeal more to old school gamers who played in the days of roliing handfuls of dice and checking combat resolution tables, but as a fan of streamlined Eurogames, this one was pretty lame.

It's pretty fun, but you can almost forget the defensive play calls. They almost never affect the play. So it comes down to what play the offense calls and how well they roll. Unless they balanced this perfectly, I am sure there is a mathematical best play to call every time as well. I want to try the expansion with the additional plays. Really, there should be about 12 plays, with better modifiers.

We play with an additional rule (if you get the strongest advantage on either offense or defense, you have the option to force a re-roll of one of the three black dice that determine the offensive result).

At first glance, it doesn't seem to be very much to it.  But once in the game, it does a great job of creating the tension and frustration of a real football game.

Though influenced by the luck of the dice, it seems to accurately reflect the ease some teams have of driving down the field in one series and then going 3 and out in the next.

The game really shines with the expansions that tweak the teams just enough to make it feel like you are playing the Colts or the Bears.  My only complaint with the expansions is they come out so late in the season and reflect the previous year.

However, I also admire the designer's support of this game.  I particularly enjoy playing the Super Bowl challenge each year and helping predict the winner.

UPDATE: Have played a bit with my kid. It's a shame that the neat system for resolving yardage is tied to such a simplistic game engine. It's OK, I guess, but my Cadaco spinner-based game from the '70s plays faster and offers more interesting decisions (with 20 offensive and 8 defensive plays to choose from).

>>>>>

Overly simple, with (aside from special teams) only 3 offensive and 3 defensive plays to call, and no other decisions to make.  Apparently, the expansion doubles the number of plays and adds team-specific result charts.  Huzzah.

This may come in handy now that my son is old enough to maybe understand football a little (but not old enough to handle a more interesting game).

This is a surprisingly realistic simulation of football.  The pacing, scoring, and outcomes all feel like the real thing.  Problem is that I feel more like I'm watching a game than playing in a game.  There is a bit of strategy, but if you roll high you'll win, roll low you'll lose.  Personally, I'd rather play Battleball or Baseball Highlights for less realism but more fun. 

I think PBF is a boardgame for people who like football more than football for people who like boardgames.

RATING: 4
A very simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors with tons of dice rolling and chart look-ups.   Almost no strategy whatsoever, because the results of the R-P-S makes almost no difference on the 3d6 roll that follows.   This game also has one of the worst rulebooks (spread across countless sheets) that I've ever seen.   Especially for such a simple, intuitive game.   In the end, though, it still does manage to do a good job simulating the ebb and flow of a football game.   I'm not a huge fan of sports sims, but this is quick and mindless enough to make a cute diversion.   Just roll the dice and peg your yards.  That's about all there is to it.

Fair. I got this to play with my dad, who's a sports nut.  Unfortunately his love of sports does not extend to board games.  He'd rather just spend his days flipping between ESPN and Fox News.  Sigh.

As for the game itself: well, it's okay.  One weird thing about sports games in general: sport are generally considered to be ritualized combat; i.e physical contests constrained by rules to keep everyone safe.

But why make a game about sports when you can just make a game about the thing that sports abstract anyway?  It seems to add an extra layer of abstraction.  Plus, shooting people and blowing them up is way more fun.

I'm not much of a football fan, but this seems like an excellent football game.  My interest in football has increased since I've played this a few times.  It's light, but manages to produce a nice "football feel".  It takes a while to play the full professional game, though.  Play with the expansion plays and teams for the full effect.

A huge thank you to Danny Mack for this gift!

Very fun football game, simulating the tension of a sports game, fun without being too complicated - even if it is somewhat of a RPS dice fest.  Check out Tom Vasel's review, and the Board Games With Scott video.

The choices of defensive player don't have a huge impact, with the dice rolling of offensive player being the biggest factor (high rolls are good!), but there are choices to make especially for offense - do you go for a more conservative run player, or a more risky long pass with potential for greater rewards?  Do you go for fourth and short, or do you punt or attempt a field goal?  It is a very fun and exciting simulation that does a good job of mimicking an actual football game.

RATING: 4
Much better than I expected.  Doesn't require too much knowledge of football, and really distills football down into a psychological game.  It is a dicefest, though, and it's easy to get trounced early on.  I'd definitely like to try it again.

EDIT:  Choices seem interesting, but are ultimately illusory, especially on the defensive end.  Even good decisions yield no advantage most of the time.  Interesting as a simulation, fails as a game.  And I really don't care enough about football to play a simulation of it.

RATING: 8
Fantastic fun, particularly if you like sports games (like me)!  It's nice that it has a short game (less than fifteen minutes) too.

It is a dicefest, and a rock-paper-scissors strategy will work just as well as a thought out strategy unless you are playing with the expansion teams written for the NFL.  Those make the game a bit more fun, since there are modifiers depending upon the team's strengths and weaknesses.  Keep in mind that the Super Bowl teams are published on the website for free every year, so investing in a whole expansion pack isn't really necessary, particularly just for trying the game out with teams.

I bought Bowl Bound, which is based on college football, which is much more my thing (go Irish!).  I didn't see the need for two football games, so I traded this away.
---------------
Fast forward to 2011 and I bought this game on Tanga.  It was cheap enough, and it is more accessible than any other football game.  While I don't regret trading the first time, for the Tanga price it was worth getting again.

I didn't enjoy this game at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

Preliminary rating--have played one sudden death shootout that we stopped at 14-14, and played one drive using the full time system and stopped at 3-0.  The results certainly feel like real football.

Next time we play it will be a full game with the added plays, I imagine my rating will go up farther.



UPDATE:  This one is actually in danger of the rating going DOWN.  Recent playing with my brother, we used the expansion.  There were plenty of times where he would call the proper defense--the risky version, no less--and STILL get "no effect" rolls.

As for me, I was destroying him but I didn't feel like it was because I was a superior player.  Like, on 3rd and 1, I called the run.  He knew this and called run blitz.  He got "no effect" and I broke open a run for 16 yards.  Once I got up on him 14-0, we just called the game 1/3 of the way through the 3rd quarter.

A  minimalist kind of football game that strips out much of the tedium of more stat-heavy games but leaves most of the fun. Transparent system allows you to quickly concentrate on the game situation, rather than having to fight the rules and the system. Some rules clarity is sacrificed by directing players to learn as they go, quickly setting up a game and churing through the charts. Much of the complexity is nicely distributed into the charts set, but questions (and answers) here on BGG reveal some player confusion about how defense effects and bonus dice are actually applied in-game. The additional plays available in the expansion improve the experience slightly, but I don't think the team cards add much versus just playing head-to-head without team modifiers. Over time it is hard to get away from the sense that rolling high on those three black dice is substantially more important than good play calling; in this regard the game appears to reward luck over skill which drops it down a peg.

  Since this is selling at jcpenneys for nickels on the dollar its probably now totally untradeable.  (Edit- wrong about that.  I traded it!)

I think the expansion teams certainly take care of these issues.

The best sports game.
I love American Football. It is my favourite sport. Ultimate team sport in which there is a lot of tactical scheming going on from the coaching side but in the end it's a matter of one guy winning the battle with another guy in front of him.

Pizza Box Football simulates this well. You get to be in the part of the coach scheming and planning, calling the plays. Dice the simulate how well your guys "win the battle   with the guys in front of them".

It has a lot of dice rolling and in the beginning there is a lot of chart reading and it all can feel overwhelming. But when you get a hang of it, the whole "guessing your opponents next moves and trying to yours" comes into play. In the end it feels like you are the coach in the sidelines trying to outsmart the opponent and hoping your team executes according to your plans... at least for me it feels like this! :)

I have tried a lot of different american football games and this is by far the best!

RATING: 4
All the rules of (North American) Football are there, except for penalties.  Come on, it would not have been too difficult to implement.

As for gameplay, you don't really get a feeling that you are usefull when playing on Defense, as even if you guess the right play, all it provides is perhaps a minus 1 modifier if you rolled high enough, or a -2 if you rolled 2 or 12 (on 2d6).

As is, this is more of a solo game than anything else.  Perhaps it would be easy to come up with house rules so that the defensive player would get an immediate modifier for selecting the correct counter-play.

If the offensive player rolls well, there is absolutely nothing the defensive player can do.  By the same token, if the offensive player rolls badly (less then 10 on 3d6), there is nothing the defense needs to do.

On the positive side, the components are of good quality, and I especially like the fact that the reference cards are laminated.

There are better games on the subject out there, including AH's PAYDIRT!, which was released in the late 70's-early 80's.

I really want to like this game, and overall the game play is fun.  My only gripe is that the game doesn't reward good guessing consistently.

I need to play this one more to see if this trend changes.

A dice fest, but just about at the level of weight for a game of this nature.  It had its tense moments and its choices.  Football has always held out the most promise for tactical decision making of any of the major American sports.  Pizza Box football illustrates that potential nicely.  Still maybe a touch long (though shorter than many weaker games on the same subject), I enjoyed it.

I think that this is a very good and very clever football model that strikes a delicate balance between playability and realism.  I opened the box and I was playing within minutes (compare this to strat-o-matic which I gave up on as the rules didn't make the game seem much fun to me).  I do think that most people (real football fans anyway) will want to use the upcoming expansion rules and 32 teams as I can see that the new options for play-calling and team stregths/weaknesses will add much needed variety and an additional layer of strategic depth.  I'll reserve judgement until I play a few games with the expansion rules, but I'm guessing that my rating will rise.

Note:  I'm not saying that this is a game for everyone.  Though, I think casual & serious football fans will find this game enjoyable as long as they don't mind a lot of dice chucking.

have played this once with the expansion set.Can't imagine playing it without the xpansion set would be too simple / dull.As it is its an OK game - but you don't have that much influence - even if you call the play exactly right OR fool the defence completely it still comes down to 3D6 with a very minor adjustment (1 or 2 at the very most) So luck is the major part. However for a simple to read pick up and play game its OK

Calling this a "strategy game" is a misnomer.  It might entertain for a game or two, but after that, there really isn't anything to it that would bring you back.  The only decisions (and I mean ONLY) are whether, on offense, you will run a RUN, SHORT PASS or LONG PASS play, and on defense, you will defend against a RUN, SHORT PASS or LONG PASS play.  This is Rock-Paper-Scissors followed by a bunch of dice-rolling and chart-consulting.  No thanks.

Good dice chucking, and generally produces believable football stats (contrast with Madden) -- but the player on defense has very little impact on things.  Great with younger kids who like football; it's very easy to craft a narrative to go with the dice (I'd bump the rating in that context).

This is an interesting little game that boils down to buckets of dice.  I haven't really found it compelling, but the packaging is nice, and I think with the right game partner and the right frame-of-mind, it might provide for some good diversion.  Thumbs up for providing solitaire rules.

PBF is a decent attempt to simulate the football experience, but in the end the results were too dependent on dice rolls and it felt too generic. Play selection mattered little as even when guessing correctly, there was often no effect.   The gameplay, while fun at first, gets tedious with the constant dice rolling and chart consulting.  Also, playing a complete game will likely take twice as long as stated in the rulebook - it took us 60 minutes to just get to halftime and we were playing fast.

I heard that the expansion improves things slightly by expanding play selection, but I don't think it would be enough for me to truly like the game. Give me some sort of specific player expansion (cards?) and make play selection actually matter (-1 or 1 to a 3d6 doesn't cut it) and I might be interested.

I've only played the basic version, which is too simple for my taste (and requires a lot of dice rolling.)  It reminds me of the old PC football games where you could choose run, short pass, and long pass, and then you waited for the yardage announcement.  

The advanced version looks more interesting, and I hope to try it out. Right now I prefer Strat-o-matic.

A little bit too much dice-throwing for me, although I realize that this is pretty much standard for this type of game (on the plus side, it feels like the guys calculated their odds spot-on). It's a good game, especially with the right opponent, but after 4 quarters it starts being a bit repetitive and monotonous.
Verdict: a must have for football sim fanatics, and an decent occasional game for football enthusiasts like me.

Based on one play with college overtime rules and one quarter with professional rules.  At first I thought it was pretty fun, lots of dice rolling.  But now I think there's really very little strategy effect on the game.  Even if the defense guesses correctly, it seems like the best you usually get is a -1 on the offense's black dice roll.  Yippee-doo.  I'm not one to cry "random" or to want no-luck games...but I have to say...it seems that any decisions in the game have pretty much no effect on anything.

Good game overall, although I feel that the expansion is vital. I don't have it, but the basic game seems a bit limited, as having two identical teams limits the long-term interest. Three (minor)complaints, defense often has very little impact on the play, it seems very hard to get a completion on a long pass, and some of the rules (especially those dealing with turnovers) are a bit confusing.

It's ok.  It's great that it manages to create statistics just like in a real football game, but it's really just a dice fest with a tiny bit of second guessing your opponent.

More fun than it has any right being.  Essentially a game of Rock Paper Scissors where the choice gives a +/- 1 on the roll of 3d6.  You are much more at the mercy of the dice than anything else, yet it gives the feel of participating in the game so enjoyably that it hardly matters!  Love it!

Very clever game, in that it's so darn simple, yet feels like football and plays quickly while allowing for some coaching decisions on offense or defense. One aspect I really like is that calling the wrong defense doesn't necessarily result in a big gain. That, and the dice rolling avoids what could have been a static design, while providing a wide variety of potential outcomes. The "Pizza Box" design is clever, too,and works while keeping the price of the game down. It seems to me this game was well play-tested, too, and its designers do a great job of marketing the game, with a first-rate website, downloads, expansions, and so on.

As a simulation it probably works pretty well, with expected results and yardage and possibilities for the big gains. As a game, not so well. The defense's big decision is to accurately pick which of run, short pass or long pass you're going to choose. Choosing correctly gives a minor benefit, it may reduce the yardage, but only if the defense then rolls well. After that, the offense rolls against a chart matching their selection (roll high!) which will tell you what dice to roll for yardage (roll high!). That's it. Over and over and over for over an hour. Tiresome. There's other charts for punts, field goals, kickoffs, etc, but it's just different means of rolling, with no decisions to make. Pass. (Boom-tish.)

This game represents a tremendous amount of design effort and I appreciate the game's "statistical validity" and approach.  However it takes too long to play and the defensive calls don't matter enough...I'd guess offhand that close to 70% of the defensive results are no effect, while 25% of the remaining 30% are  /- 1.  Those matter over the long haul of a full NFL game but they make for dull play.  It might be a realistic game but the player doesn't have enough input (I'm sure coaches around the league share in this frustration!).  One big problem: the lack of penalties.  Minor problems: innaccurate timing (games are too short), no out of bounds, no customized kicking plays for the expansion teams, etc.

For an NFL game the defensive choices don't feel right...I would have gone with Standard, Nickel, Dime, Blitz.  As it is the Blitzing in this game is all wrong, and so 3rd downs don't feel like 3rd downs.

I wanted to rate this higher but I know I will never play it again, thus it is a 3.

The number of tables and the theme may repel many players. I admit, I was a bit overwhelmed by the tables and all the cross-checkings, but it became quite easy after some minutes of playtime.

Total lenght of one game is a bit too long, but if you have enough time, why complain? The game includes a lot of dice-rolling and thus luck, but afterall tactics are still involved. I like how they have managed to make American football abstractions here.
Totally enjoyable! Hard to get somebody interested, but harder to stop playing.

A bluffing game, believe it or not.  Too much luck for my taste, though. (Update) After playing this once a year for a few years around the Super Bowl, I think this game would be substantially improved if there was a bigger reward/penalty for correctly/incorrectly calling the right play. Currently it doesn't matter much whether the defense predicts the offense's play: just whether the offense rolls well.

The defender secretly chooses one of six defense options.  Then the offense player chooses one of six plays.  The defender's defense is referenced to the offense play and then at least three rounds of dice rolling takes place.  Yes it's basically paper-rock-scissors, but it does a pretty good job of capturing the feel of a football game.  But I don't like playing paper rock scissors for two hours.

This game was an unbelievable disappointment.  Basically, its rock scissors paper, except the rock scissor paper has little barring on the result which is just dice rolling and a lot of it.  Maybe this is appealing to those who don't know anything about football but i was expecting a couple playbooks with 20 or so choices and then some dice rolling.  Also, you're rolling so much, it feels like you just rushing to get the dice in the dice tower just to get the game moving.  I see the expansion has six choices at least, this might make it a little better but it just needs more.  this is just terrible!  Rather play Photoelectric football for the 60s and 70s.  More strategy in that at least.

I'm impressed with this game, but not sure how much I'll play it. I'm not usually a fan of blind selection games, but it obviously works perfectly for play calling in football. The pace and timing is captured very well. The only downside is the rules, which don't really tell you how to play. You have to infer how by looking at all the (nicely laminated) charts and use your knowledge of real football.

Still not exactly the football game I dream of.  This was a bit simplistic in the gameplay, though the results were surprisingly believable.

This is a light, but fun game. If you're looking for a heavy football simulation this isn't it. But, if you're looking for something to break out while the game's on TV on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon this is perfect. 

Gameplay is simple yet there are enough elements to make it fun. There are also some really well thought out elements like the beer-resistant laminated player sheets.

I think it's a pretty good game. I don't think I'd call it a simulation... I would reserve that term for the Madden or NCAA console series.

But, it does a good job of keeping the feel of a football game without getting tedious. Playcalling in football has a certain bluff element and I think PBF captures that pretty well. Throw in a little randomness and a little strategy, and it's definitely a game worth playing... especially during the pre-game show.

--May2006-- (Played at KublaCon)  Quite a delightful football simulation:  rather than simply simulating the net result in any given combination of offensive and defensive calls, it recreates a great deal of the dynamics of the football narrative, too.

Of all the ahistorical (i.e. generic team) football games I've played, this is the best.  Unfortunately, that's damning with faint praise.

I enjoy this game.  I don't generally like American football, and I don't like mindless dice-fests.  This distills the bits of football that I DO find enjoyable and keeps it light and fast-moving. I know enough statistics to "see" the differences in the tables produced by correctly guessing the opponent's strategy -- subtle, but definitely there.  I'll have to trust others that that overall probabilities are accurate; I can only say that they provide sufficient variety in the game and usually produce reasonable results, while still allowing for occasional unexpected events (e.g., a fumble/recovery/breakaway/touchdown! sequence).  

Some of the symbols could use better explanations but I eventually found everything I needed to know in the rules or reference cards (sometimes in footnotes).  I would strongly recommend downloading the free extras from their website, doubling the number of offensive/defensive choices.

Solo game works well, with free download from official site for offensive/defensive calls and overall strategy (about the same number of rolls as a 2-player game, but obviously the same player is making all of them).

Fun, and accessible for non-gamers and younger players.

Sports. Played a "Backyard Brawl" limited game and now we're at halftime in a full game. Dice-heavy but still fun, with tension mounting as time runs out each half. Looking forward to playing a full pro game, and with the expansion plays for more variety in play-calling.

Ended up trading it after years on the shelf.

Pretty good game, recommended for people who also like games like B-17.

The effect of calling the right defense could be a bit higher though. If you choose the right counter-move but roll bad (not very bad, just bad) you'll end up having no effect on the play.

Still, the game creates very realistic results and is very tense if you like dice rolling.

It's a dicefest, but if definitely replicates the feel of a real football game.  I guess there really is a lot of luck in sports anyway--one pass a few inches shorter or longer can change the entire game.  Run, short pass, or long pass?  Go for it or punt?  I think it is a lot of fun.  It only takes a few plays to get the hang of using the charts.  I haven't tried the expansion yet.  It is a LOT of dice rolling and chart lookups, though.

Got in a trade on 3/2007.  I don't win this game much, but I still have a great time.  It is almost always close and the scores are pretty close to real football - perhaps a little low.  I have played all levels except the lowest and like the full game the best, either professional or smashmouth.  Allows for more choices and feels like you have more control.  A full game takes about two hours, but you could play a shorter game by playing only two quarters.  Would love to play with the expansions - they add more play options and more variety.

Somehow the exciting game of football is transfigured into a peg and some dice.  But it works pretty well--I find the game exciting and particularly like the shorter versions.

Good fun factors and good ergonomics with the pegs marching up and down the board at yard markers.  Generally speaking, Paydirt is a much better implementation of the simultaneous play-calling system, but I think the kickoffs and punts in Pizza Box Football are better.  Perhaps a merger of the two games would be in order.

This one has completely grabbed my attention. First of all, the presentation is close to perfect. Any football fan who sees this on the shelf will immediately be drawn to it. It just looks FUN. I've been a pro football fan for over 30 years and the Strat-o-APBA type games always looked complicated and boring. I suppose they appeal to those who like to track stats*. The only stats I ever cared about were points scored and W/L record. 

* For the record, Pizza Box Football does include a worksheet that allows you to track stats. And there are also league rules and procedures. 

Pizza Box Football has a three step play result system, which seems cumbersome at first. It becomes second nature very quickly, however, since you are doing it for every play. After offense/defense plays are revealed: 

1. Defense rolls dice to determine a defense modifier, which is applied to step 2. 

2. Offense rolls (modified by def modifier) to determine the *general* outcome of the play. 

3. Offense rolls again to determine the *specific* results of the play. 

There is a chart for each of the above, plus other charts for other situations, like punt, kickoff, field goals, etc. There are quite a few charts to keep track of, but as long as you already understand the rules of football, they're not at all difficult to digest. And, ironically, I believe that the three step dice rolling procedure helps to ensure that the "right" thing will happen most of the time. 

I love Football Strategy because of it's pure elegance. PBF loses yardage on elegance, but scores a touchdown by adding that needed dose of uncertainty to the proceedings. In FS, the same offense/defense will always provide the same result, which makes it more of a psychological match-up. TO be fair, FS also has ALOT more plays to choose from. Still, the pre-determined results can feel a little forced sometimes. In PBF, you can defend properly against a long pass and *still* get screwed. There's something to be said for that.

Update [6-13-07]: Fun game, but just doesn't see alot of table time. Maybe I'll just design my own football board game (hint hint).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Strong on theme.  Does a pretty good job at simulating something approaching a believable football game.  (The scores are pretty realistic.)  However, this game is very heavy on luck.  Offense chooses a play (usually run, short pass or long pass).  Defense tries to guess which play the Offense will choose.  At that point the dice take over completely and the results all depend on what comes up on the tables.  It's fun enough but don't expect to have much control over the game.

I'd rather play Football Strategy where at least you have a bit more control.  This is a dicefest football simulation game.  Roll the dice, compare to chart, rinse and repeat.  No thank you.  Others seem to enjoy this one but to me it seems a bit silly.

RATING: 4
Played 5+ times.  This feels like a good statistical simulation of Football.  If you don't know the rules to football (a) you will be missing some of the rules of the game and (b) you probably are not a football fan and therefore may not enjoy the game as much as a fan.  This game is absolutely great for football fans.  It's fast dice rolling action and team strategy.  I'm sure there's enough dice rolled each game to even out the probabilities. The result is the stats machine in the dice tables working like clockwork.  Lots of fun.  Add beer and enjoy.  2006/02/02

A massive dice fest and I'm really not sure that the defensive player does much of anything, but the game has a nicely thematic bluff and double-bluff aspect to it.

I may rate it higher after using the expansion rules. But at the moment, the defense doesn't seem to have enough impact on the offense for my tastes. I don't want a definite stuff of an offensive play if you guess well, like in Football Strategy.  I just want there to be a little more impact on the offensive die rolls.

Yes, your decisions have much less impact on the outcome of the game than blind luck does, but it feels like they do.  Besides even if you know that it's mostly luck of the dice the experience is still fun.

Has all the feel of NFL football and that's fun for me.

Definitely get one of the expansions as the advanced play-calling of the individual teams makes the game much better and I do think it gives you a bit more control.

The full professional game my be a bit long for what the game is, but the game can be tense if it is close at the end.

While I like football simulations, I'm just not die-hard enough for some of the old AH entries. Strat and APBA are too detailed for me. This game strikes a nice balance. The expansions allow you to play your favorite teams and the basic game even gives you four different levels of strategy to choose from. If you want to keep stats to talk about the big game later, they have that too.

My seven-year-old and I have had a blast since picking this up. He gets out his mini-helmet collection and we place those on the corresponding endzones. Now, if I can just find a miniature marching band...

Fun little dice rolling football game.  My main complaint is it doesn't simulate the game well.  The offense and the defense both choose Run, Short Pass, Long Pass.  There isn't any regard whether it's 4th and inches or 1st and 20.  It is fun to move up and down the field, but there really isn't a reason to not go Long Pass nearly every play.

RATING: 2
I've played the first two "levels" of this game and find it quite a bit boring.  Rather than selecting particular offensive or defensive plays, the defense guesses if the offense is going to do a run, short pass, or long pass.  The defense rolls dice and consults a chart that either helps or hinders the offense based on the guess and the dice rolled.  The offense then rolls to see what gains or losses they make.  That's about it.  It looks like there is clock management in the 'full' version, but I have to admit after about 5 plays this game has gotten really stale.  Bleah.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great football simulation.  Scratches a particular itch and scratches it well - meaning I will really want to play if I'm in the mood for football.  

Results are higher-scoring affairs than your average game, but not unrealistic.  I think the main reason for this is that penalties are not incorporated in the game.

Easy to learn.  Once you get the hang of it, it moves quickly.  Avoid if you don't like rolling dice.

Disclaimer: I am a HUGE Football fan.  
I'm really amazed how real the results of this game feel.  Yes, there are lot of die rolls (and luck), but you mitigate the luck factor with clever play calls.  The results feel very statistically right on.  Really, really like PBF to get my football fix (especially in the NFL off-season).

RATING: 7.5
A suprisingly good simulation of football. The mechanisms are pretty simple, rolling dice and using a lookup table to decide what happens.  The defence decides to defend 1 of 3 play types, long pass, short pass, run.  The offense decides on a play.  The defense rolls 2 dice and uses a look up table to determine a modifier.  The offense then rolls 3 dice applies the modifier and looks up the results in a table.  Often the results cause you to roll more dice to determine the exact result.  Yes you roll dice a lot.  Runs and complete passes take up a lot of time, time outs and incompletes don't.  Our game was a bit of blow out and by the 3rd quarter the outcome was determined much like a real game and then it played like a real game with the leader running out the clock.  If you don't like rolling dice stay away from this one but all in all I found it quite enjoyable.  I already have some ideas to expand this.  Customize look up tables based on real team statistics, more play type categories (yes this means more dice), a penalty die used on really good plays and really bad plays, etc.  I think I'm going to have some fun with this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Flawed simulation that opts for speed of play over strategy.  Components are high-quality, but have an austere graphic design.  The looks don't get this one off the shelf very often, but when I do play it, it can go over well with the right opponent.  Not really too much strategy, as by far the most influence on the outcome of the play is the roll of the offense.  If the offense rolls high, they'll do well, no matter what play they or the defense choose.  The solitaire method of play found on [url=http://www.pizzaboxfootball.com/]the company website[/url] is great, almost as satisfying as the original game.

I've played a lot of football sims, and there are many I would recommend before this one.  If you are looking for a game of this depth, I'd look into tracking down an old copy of [gameid=1498] first.

I enjoy the game mechanics but I absolutely hate how much dice rolling is involved.  Figuring out which dice to roll, transferring the dice back and forth between the players, and consulting all of the charts for the roll effect is just too time consuming.  The game seems to be balanced very well, and unfortunately the mechanics necessitate rolling up to 5 separate dice on each turn (due to the bonus dice mechanic) rather then one dice with more sides.  While I'd hesitate to recommend the game, if you don't mind rolling a lot of dice I believe it would be entertaining for you.  A simple computer program on a laptop could cure my main gripe, but I just don't want to spend the time to write one.  I may give them game one more try to see if the rolling gets much quicker when you start to memorize the dice combos, but not sure I can talk anyone into playing with me.

Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player than announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.

Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.

Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once. Its robust, statistically accurate play satisfies even the most demanding football fanatic while remaining accessible enough for the younger or casual fan.

Pretty disappointed by this. The core guesswork is fun, but: (a) playcalls too often have little bearing on the outcome; (b) there is no real sense of team (let alone player) differentiation; and (c) there's a lot of lookup, xref this, find that...it's fussy.

The first critique, though, is the most damning for me. There are way too many "no effect" or "cancel bonus" type modifiers, so you end up feeling like all the interesting stuff goes for naught, while the core 3d6 roll determines the whole game. Why not more modifiers and a larger spread? And the team distinctions are laughable, and needn't've been.

So, a number of good ideas and nice components, but it ends up feeling very generic. Too bad. Maybe I'll get back into Stratomatic....

I've only played this a couple times and it really isn't quite what I hoped for.  The play selection is a bit limited and regardless of the calls the player rolling higher is going to win (though admittedly a real game of football feels this way sometimes too! :)  I picked up the expansion and it really improves this game as the play call selection doubles and the increased risk/reward plays make things much more interesting.

The naysayers are out there, and I don't care.  This game is FUN, with a capital "F"!  I can't wait to try out the free expansion where each side (offense and defense) gets 6 plays each, or the expert rules where you start delving into managing the time clock.  If it's as much fun as playing with the basic rules, I'll up my rating immediately.  It's funny how this game's struck a chord with me, because I'm not even the biggest football fan.  But this one has the perfect meld of simulation and luck for me, which makes it a winner (did I mention that it's fun?)  Rating update to a 8 with the advanced playset: it's better than with the three basic plays on a side.  Can't wait to play a full game with a friend.  Soon.

We've played a 4 team league at lunchtime. Great game, we all enjoyed playing. Dice roll certainly effects the results of the plays called, but the overall rolls resulted in expected football results. I got some sneak peaks for the advanced game and teams. The advanced game is even better. The defense has a bigger effect on the outcome. I did feel I was running the Philly team, without the contract whining, of course!

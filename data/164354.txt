I fell in love with this game. It's a filler with a little bit of deduction. Now, when I can choose between Love letter and this, I pick Kryptos (less luck, the same amount of fun and maybe the Letter a little bit overplayed).

Mechanics are fine, but should have a house rule with "time limit" as if you look long enough around you will find the good answer...

simple enough deduction game that allows for a surprising amount of deductive logic. Worth a look because it is shorter and less effort than much of the competition. It doesn't require a note taking system like Sleuth for instance.

Kryptos is a simple game of deduction where player’s hands slowly open up as competitors guess which number specific cards are that their opponent’s hold (they are all ranked from lowest to highest).

While thematically Kryptos is lacking the game itself can be quite interesting.  Given it is a card game players can end up with a terrible hand which puts them at a severe disadvantage but other than that it is a good game in a neat little box.

I am inclined to think this would be a good game to teach older kids problem solving as many variables are known, then it's a game of probability and educated guessing.

*Always, always, ALWAYS play with the 'advanced rules,' Firstly it stops the game from dragging on; secondly there is nothing advanced about them, it just makes it a better game.

A good little deduction game cf Mastermind. A set of card holders would be great to avoid having to hold the cards fanned out in your hand the whole time.  Wonder if you need to reduce the value for guessing when a colour is down to 2 or 1 like when someones hand is down to 2 or 1?

A clever little deduction game. There are times when you can string a few things together and make a smart deduction, and that feels good. There are other times when you just have to rely on luck, and that feels... not good. Given the weight and playtime I don't have too much of an issue forgiving the luck. A more negative element is the tendency to have someone trail behind with no real hope of catching up. 

On the whole I like the game. It offers a bite sized deduction game which is not something you often get. It plays up to 6 which makes is ideal as filler material.

Nice little deduction game that reminds me a lot of Da Vinci Code (aka Coda). The scoring system of Kryptos might be better than the player elimination in DVC, but components-wise DVC is lightyears ahead.

Uno dei più carini giochi provati a Essen 2014. Veloce e simpatico è un gioco che richiede intuito e concentrazione. Una via di mezzo tra Hanabi (per come si mostrano e si tengono le carte) e Mastermind (per la deduzione che bisogna fare). Lo trovo veloce da presentare e molto apprezzato come filler. Materiali essenziali e non impeccabili.

Light 3-6 Player:

Oh man how I love this little game. An excellently deep deduction for three to four players. Plays fast and hard and cleanly. I like the theme as well. And it truly does feel like you are attempting to crack a code.

If you're played in the past The Mastermind, you'll love Kryptos. This game shows a real level of players deduction skill.

RATING: 5.5
Played once with 5P. In Kryptos, players deduce the values of specific cards in their opponents' hands. There is a fair bit of information available to make this possible – players have to consider the order by which cards are arranged in hand, the colours that opponents have, as well as the cards they have in their own hand. Understandably, a large part of the game tests how well you can work out the puzzle in your mind. But luck also plays a noticeable role here, as we found it often came down to a 50-50 chance of guessing the right card.

Be warned though that the card stock used is on the thin side; it is possible to see through the cards even in modest amounts of sunlight. After observing a 3P game, I would also not recommend Kryptos at that player count because the deduction element becomes far too simplistic.

Interesting concept, but just not enough game, particularly with fewer than five or six players. Considering how easy it gets to guess cards, it rarely makes sense to take a second guess and put yourself behind on points. Too bad, I had high hopes for this one.

RATING: 7
Excellent deduction filler where a set of cards numbered 1-X (where X differs with different player counts) across four colours (e.g. blue is 1, 5, 9...) are evenly distributed between players. Each player takes a number of chips showing the [i]colours[/i] of their cards, then turns two cards outwards, as in Hanabi.

From then on, players just make one guess per turn as to the number of a hidden card, getting 3VP if correct.

A smooth, elegant design.

I have to say it: This game is too easy! In most of my games, there was verry little amount of false moves. But, on the other hand, if you found it in good price you can take it - its ok for 3-4 games, before you realize how to win at it almost every time.

First, version.  All cards -YUK! 0.01 rating.

Since then it's been reworked, great art and components BUT still a bit to cut throat for me.  At least you arent steam rolled as MUCH.

Great idea. Are we supposed to play through the whole deck? That's what we did and it really dragged on. We kept doing the same motions until the game came to a stop.

The English was so bad that some rules were unclear. The art could... evolve into something more.

Looking forward to playing the expansion. The concept is just great.

The game works as a game of hand management.  I just thought it was a bit on the dull side.  I had a lot more fun playing [thing=1159][/thing] when it came to a game involving a species changing traits and [thing=50][/thing] and [thing=760][/thing] are better games for hand management.

Like the idea, like how it was set up but in a 2 player game I didn't like it.  We didn't even finish because the deck was to big and the other player got the better hand from te beginning so there was no way to come back.  With more players I think it must be better.  Rating may go up after another play.

Initial Impression: This is a clever little card game. Having to keep track of population, body size, card count, and traits that you and your opponents acquire makes for an interesting multifaceted game. The game plays fairly quickly with an interesting food mechanism. I played the North American prototype and will be curious to see how the final version looks.

You can have a lot of fun with this light hearted take that cardgame. The evolution theme fits the game extraordinarily well. Players find themselves competing for food while also trying to keep their animals safe from predators. Or you could become a predator yourself and eat your oponents species. Or even your own. It's all possible in this game. Gameplay is fluent and the rules are simple enough to start playing almost immediately. Nevertheless there are some problems with the game. It has a runaway leader problem and while some mechanics probably mimic the biology theme very well, they just take away from the playability. But overall this is a very good game that is a lot of fun to play.

Nice. A half hour take-that type filler certainly but this one felt a bit different. Two or three uses for each card and a phased turn makes this feel like a heavier game to start with, but it has all the randomness, daftness and ability to pick on each other that you would want for a filler. Yes, very enjoyable and I want to play again.

I've played two 3-player games and enjoy it quite a bit. It's simply fun to build up these creatures and try desperately to keep them alive. I don't think there's a lot of strategy, but there's definitely lots of choices about what creatures get what traits.

I really enjoyed our first game. The only thing is the deck is a little big and the cards you play at the beginning usually won't matter much for the scoring, at the end. We thought a scoring at mid-game would mitigate this problem.

Fun, interesting game with an original theme. Despite the wide variety of cards the game seems very balanced, and the special abilities can make for some interesting combos. Two things I didn't like: 1) the game punishes players who have fallen behind by allowing the leaders to draw more cards each turn, and 2) the end scoring arbitrarily grants victory to the player who just happens to be in first place on the last turn (when that player can vary wildly from turn to turn). I'd like to see a scoring system that keeps track of kills/animals over the course of the game rather than just in the final turn. Can't wait for the next expansion.

The basic idea and game play seemed pretty cool, but the flow of the game just seemed off to me.  In particular, the game seemed to go too long with too many ebbs and flows to the game to only have one final scoring at the end after all of the activity.  It just made the early game seem kind of pointless to me.  Seemed like there should have been some sort of intermediate scoring or something.

You can literally be down to no surviving creatures at points in the game, and still win.  The gist of the game mainly seems to be to make sure that no one gets one mega-creature that becomes unstoppable; to just remain at parity with the other players hoping to eek it out in the end.

Overall, I loved the idea of the game and some of the execution.  The game arc just didn't sit right with me.

One game so far. Some nice thematic ideas. Strange in that the game is won or lost in the last round which makes all previous rounds rather superflous except for building up a really good hand of cards in readiness for the final feeding frenzy. It has some 'take that' play so it's unlikely that any animal will survive the whole game.

RATING: 6.5
Test play finished on Oct 27, 2012 with a gamer.  The game is not bad and quite innovative for using the bio traits.  Graphics design is simple and looks neat.  It looks closely to our studying materials in Biology lesson in secondary school.  I prefer this classic design to Taiwan version.  
However the game is too random and chaos for serious player.  There is also a flaw design of the final scoring.  The house rule for using the triangle numbers or Fibonacci series cannot help too much.  The food generated by dice is also too far random for players.  (It can be improved by using 4 seasons or 12 months food trend with using dice for modifier.
Some cards are too strong; e.g 水生, 吸血, 寄生.  Those cards are also drawn randomly from the pile.  It makes the game far from balance.  From another point of view, it is not a good fun game but a good education game for kids.

It's obvious that the designer knows his theme and has designed to it. As such it's an interesting take on the evolution of species. Unfortunately there seems like there could be a bit of a runaway leader issue as once you're down then you won't have the card resources to get yourself back up or defend yourself. But this is only based on 1 two player game so far.

You can tell this game was made by a bioligist professor

Looking forward to making up relevant game play mechanics
that can take away some of the card draw randomness.
You can also tailor this game to the time limit available to play, which is a nice feature. Again creativity can unleash many potential evolutionary traits that can be expanded upon.Long Live Darwin!!

Potentially neat game, but what your really waiting for is food scarcity when you have initiative. Given that narrow strategy you are building a Rube Goldberg creature that manages to survive by being in the right place in the turn order. Better than Dominant Species by virtue of a short playing time.

Evolution is fun.  It is fun to develop animals with interesting and often amusing traits.  There are some decisions to be made, particularly when choosing which traits to play and how to best utilize these traits to sustain an animal's life.  There is a challenge to developing an animal properly to maximize their chance of survival.

Sadly, much of this is determined by the random roll of the dice.  Players have NO idea how much food may be available each round.  So, one's careful planning can be completely dashed by a poor dice roll.  One's herd can be decimated – or even completely extinguished – by these wild swings of fortune.   Perhaps this does mimic reality in the age of dinosaurs, but it makes for a highly random game where careful planning is rendered virtually useless.

There are other problems as well.  As mentioned, scoring only at the end of the game, which seems absurd in a game with such chaos.  Making matters worse is that on the most important round of the game – the final round – it is quite possible some players may not even receive cards due to the depletion of the deck.  Thus, one's hands can be tied entering the most crucial round.

Evolution works as a light filler, but one must be willing to accept the prevailing chaos and wide swings of fortune.  Since the game plays to completion in about 30 – 45 minutes, I can tolerate it. Still, the game would be SO much better with some rules modifications that reduce some of the randomness and improve the scoring system.  Perhaps Evolution can itself evolve!

I love the theme, the streamlined gameplay (in principle) and the sleek artwork...
... but the rules seem broken. The majority of your animals get killed rapidly, meaning that a) only the end game really matters and b) runaway leaders is a likely issue.

A rather worthy game, one that only a scientist could have come up with.

First impressions after one play with two players. Food bank and bad card luck can totally ruin the game - especially if it happens during first few turns. The most crucial cards are pairwises and if your animal isn't small it has to have some fat tissue in order to survive more than just round or two.
With two players we felt that the game did not progress very well and thus it took too long. Ofcourse that is thematically correct to get extinct by hunger or other animals' attack all the time. The overall feeling was not playing a game, it was more like a play. With more players this might be quite a nice play though.

Don't like the new 2nd ed. artwork.  This is a very simple game where you spawn creatures, genetically modify them, and attempt to survive to the end to score points (while evading or eating opponents creatures).  Bad luck can screw you over making you the target for all the attacks because all the other creatures have some form of defence while you don't.  Lots of twists & turns prior to end game scoring which can cause wild swings in who appears to be winning.  I enjoy this game (fast, simple, devious).

Interesting card game where cards can be placed on the boards on one side as an individual animal or on the other side as one of two different traits. In this manner, you can build increasing complex animals where specializations can improve survival. You get extra cards for each animal that survives a round which increases your odds of winding up with the most surviving animals with traits at the end of the game and with that the most victory points. The end result is a challenging game with great complexity. can combine 2 decks to play up to 8 players and the "time to fly expansion" adds many new traits to the game.

Too much 'take that' card play and if you don't get any combination cards, things are tough. The first half of the game probably doesn't matter too much.

Although it has some disadvantages, I enjoyed playing it very much. 
I think it's much better when you modify some rules, e.g. when you introduce a new home rule of dividing all the cards into three draw piles and count the points after each of the draw piles is exhausted instead of counting up points only at the end of the game.

I like this, but the game seems too long.  You don't really get the chance to build your tableau, it gets recycled constantly.  Which is thematic, but if there were a way to trim 1/3 of the time it would be better. Reducing the deck at random might leave imbalances.

Very nice, and I'm excited about next play. I'm very curious as to what a long-term winning strategy might be because that's far from obvious ... Rules were a bit on the short side, so I came here to get enlightened.
I can see if some people here are like "hey, some cards seem to have no drawback at all" but also see how giving each card a drawback would make for a much less streamlined gameplay.

A fun game that could indeed use multiple scoring rounds. I would suggest three rounds - one after a third of the deck has been used, the second after the second third, and the final coining double at the end of the game. The rule that the last cards go to the start player(s) seems broken.

Very good game alone, and fantastic with the expansion!  This is a card game in which you build your creatures by adding trait cards to them, and at the end of the round, the amount of food for that season is determined, and they must be fed or die.  The expansion added lots of traits and balanced the game well.

A great little game for a spare hour. Very easy to pick up, great theme, interesting and quite varied tactics. You are quite at the mercy of the food dice rolls, but I like this - I think the gameplay would become too easy and boring otherwise. We've played 4 games so far and each went down a different path so we've had a lot of variety already. My son won 3, my wife 1, and me 0! The first game was dogged by very low food levels and we had difficulty evolving anything very spectacular. The next had much more food and we began to appreciate the effectiveness of some of the defensive traits - we also found out that you had to be careful about when and how to become a carnivore. Later we learnt to hate piracy and grazing - these traits are magnets for parasites!

A species based game in the spirit of Primordial Soup but on a simpler level. 

Each player is trying to add new traits to their base creatures to help them survive against the competition. 

Certain traits will protect your critters and others will make them more of a threat to the competition. 

The key mechanic that makes the game interesting is that each creature needs to feed. Sometimes attacking an enemy earns some vital food tokens but most food is gained from feeding on the central food pool but it will disappear fast when all creatures need to feed. 

Some traits given to your creatures give them a higher food requirement to survive. 

A lot of fun if taken in the light-hearted spirit that the game intends.

RATING: 7.8
主題:1
深富教育意義的桌遊，可以直接拿來當教具的桌遊不多，本款可說是生物學教學的好教具，遊戲模擬生物基因的演化，配合每個生物紀年的食物供應量，來考驗生物的適應性，正所謂適者生存不適者淘汰。是個主題與遊戲機制能相互契合的好遊戲。

美術:0.5
卡片圖片有人說很陽春，我則覺得很有個人風格，畢竟一些演化能力是很抽象的，用實體圖片來表現，反而失去想像的空間。不過其他配件不是很精美，而是真的很陽春。但遊戲價位倒是很親民，值得大家去推廣。

規則:0.8
遊戲規則大致分成三部分，第一部分抽卡牌給予你的生物新的演化能力。第二部分，決定這回合的食物量(可以簡單說是大自然給與生物的生存壓力)。第三部分，各物種間的生存策略大對決。每個物種都要吃飽才能存活到下個生物紀，沒吃飽的就準備被淘汰。規則就是怎麼簡單好懂，除了部分演化規則文字需要細讀，其他的都很直觀。如何演化出超級物種，就是這個遊戲最有趣的地方。

設置:1
十分好設置的遊戲!放完卡牌就OK!

路線:0.7
這款遊戲路線，就是你扮演上帝，還決定物種的演化，演化策略就看你自己的知識是否能經得起大自然生存壓力的考驗。像是採用以量取勝的演化策略，或是具有高防禦力的生物以躲避肉食動物的攻擊、或是演化成高度攻擊能力的物種，想辦法吃掉別人的物種，或是演化出可以冬眠又可以儲存脂肪的生物...演化策略五花八門，真的很像是在玩一套自然教科書遊戲。

互動:0.7
玩家互動因人而異，玩家要具有強烈攻擊性，可能演化超級肉食性動物相互攻擊。而愛好和平的玩家，只想演化出各具不同特色的超級生物，來度過大自然的考驗。互動完全看玩家所採的策略決定。基本上玩家在第一階段的抽卡牌給生物演化能力時，互動就開始產生，玩家都會互相看看對方生物的演化功能，來決定自己生物的演化能力，避免演化出一隻只能當便當的物種，或者剛剛好被其他生物剋到弱點的物種。玩家互動性頗高!

個人:0.8
個人很喜歡演化的遊戲機制，當然了遊戲中免不了有運氣的存在(諸如抽演化能力卡、第二部分的食物量多寡)，但生物的演化有時也是很吃運氣的!

朋友:0.7
玩過的朋友都很感興趣，也對生物演化的專有名詞有更深刻的認識，是個適合國小生遊玩的桌遊。

想玩:0.6
遊戲概念很棒，但有時太過運氣外加太針對性，都會影響遊戲的興致。例如四人局三家只吃一家的動物時。不過以單純的卡牌類遊戲而言，這款遊戲算是很有趣味性的小品遊戲。

收藏:1
站在教育的立場，外加本遊戲物美價廉，可以收好幾套在班上做推廣!

總分:7.8
講評:本遊戲可說是卡牌對戰遊戲的簡易版、自然科學版，假如想進入卡牌對戰的世界裡，例如LCG的戰鎚、克蘇魯的呼喚，我覺得你可以考慮先玩看看這一套遊戲。試試看自己對卡牌對戰類型的遊戲感不感興趣。

RATING: 5
A game that holds thematic promise, and then turns out to be a game of basketball - start at 80-80 with 5 minutes on the clock and play it out. There's so much easy death and equalising plays available to the other players that everyone's pretty much equal going into the final round or two and then whoever gets hit the least (or gets some particularly useful cards in those rounds) defaults across the line as the winner. Which means the game is ripe for kingmaking. The game gets a rating point for theme. You get a hand full of traits. The traits you don't need you flip and they become an animal in your tableau, and then you assign them the useful traits you liked instead (attack, defense, easier to get food, etc). That's kind of fun, seeing how the combinations might work. But they'll just die anyway so it ends up futile. If you have too many animals you won't get enough food (the amount being randomly determined each round and then allocated in turn order). Also, they'll get killed off at the whim of opponents with animals with the carnivorous trait. Or opponents will simply play a parasite card on any particularly good animal, requiring it to get two extra food each round, which is generally not possible. The lesson ... don't expect any dinosaur to last for long. Which takes us back to the final round and kingmaking issues which knocks it down a heap of rating points. Which is a shame because there's an interesting game in there somewhere if the scoring approach could be re-jigged.

A nice, relatively simple card game. The base game is lacking a little, mainly regarding the effect of carnivore cards I find, but with the addition of Time to Fly the game becomes well rounded if a little overwhelming for new players and for myself to try and explain everything in one quick introduction.

A fun 3 player game, recommended only if you can get both the base game and expansion.

I've had this on my wishlist for a while strictly due to the theme. Now I can safely remove it. It wasn't absolutely terrible, and I still may find a way to incorporate it into a classroom someday, but it seemed that most of the game didn't matter. I had quite a few very cool creatures then another player played a single card that led to all of mine being eaten. The game only scores at the end, so regardless of how well a player has done, if an opponent gets the right card at the right time, it's game over. Another issue was that the game was entirely too long. We played with the first expansion, Evolution: Time to Fly, and the extra cards pushed the game to about 75 minutes. If I played again, I would randomly remove cards equal to the number of cards in the expansion.

Rating base on one uncompleted, but almost finished, play. I like the mechanism and how well the cards interact. However as you get as many cards as you have survived animals + 1, I had the feeling that the rich get ritcher as there is also no hand limit. I had a strong combo of 4 animals with strong powers who were almost impossible for my opponent to kill, while I could kill his animals easily or prevent him to get enough food. When we stopped he had 2 (basic) animals and no cards, while I had already saved up to 15 cards, just waiting to strike in the last round :D

Fell in love with this after the first game. You play animals that you assign traits to. Each trait gives your animal better chances to survive. Each round there is a feeding phase where all your animals must feed if they are to survive to the next round.Food is scarce and you may find your animals dead. You may lose even your more adapted animals. The key and the meat of the game is to create combos on your animal that will ward off enemy carnivores and ensure you a long fruitful life.

For some reason I did not expect much from this card game but this is a very fun game! You have an animal, represented by a card placed on the back.
On your turn you play a card and thus you can take a additional animal, or you can give an animal a property. For example you can create a predator that has other players' animals on his diet. Or you can give the animal a way to defend against predators, like spines or inteligence.

We played the game with the expansion Time to Fly and it appeared a fine combination. Tip.

It took a little while to get in the groove of this game but it's a tough game.  However, I think after one play it's a game that should not be taken too seriously.  Expect to lose species even really good one because there is luck factor that you just can't predict.  That being said I think this game does what it's goal is: get the feeling of survival of the fittest or sometimes the luckiest which is how evolution sometimes works.  Short enough to supply that theme and feel without drawing it out for hours and hours like a Dominate Species and it pretty fun.  Now that i know what it is I like the game and wold play anytime. Just a theory but it seems that this might be a little more strategic when you are not playing it as a duel so this game might shine more with 3 or 4.

Fairly simple card game of building up creatures, feeding them, and eating other players' creatures.  Evolving the creatures is fun and logical.  Creatures come and go quickly and often, but since the creatures only score at the end of the game, it felt like the first 2/3 of the game was meaningless.  Some mutations to the scoring system might make this game fitter.

RATING: 4
This is a card game of trying to keep the most number of your animals alive with a lot of player interaction.  Every turn players play a certain number of cards from their hand.  They can be played in any of 2-3 different ways.  They can always be played as a new animal or they can be played as 1 or 2 different traits giving that animal special abilities.

One of the most common traits you can give an animal is "carnivorous" meaning that animal can eat other player's animals.  At the end of every turn when everyone is done playing cards a number of dice is rolled showing how much food is available to forage for.  Players then take turns taking a piece of food or using one of their abilities to gain food...like eating other people's animals.

This was a little too stressful and hectic for me.  Every single aspect of this game was completely luck based.  If someone had a carnivore you had to hope you had a decent defensive card to protect yourself from them and sometimes they have a good counter to your defense meaning you wasted your card play that turn.  You have no way of knowing of course, just all luck of the draw.  Then the luck of the roll with the amount of food each round.

It just felt like play a card and see what happens with no real interesting choices to make.

I was intrigued by the idea but the game play just fell flat for us.  It was difficult to build up creatures but very easy to eat them.  There is a depth to the game that we probably didn't uncover but my son wasn't interested in it enough to give it any more tries so we traded.

Very cool game -- discovered this at Gen Con 2013.

It's better with more players because with only two you easily get into an unbalanced game where one player creates a SuperCreature that the other just can't kill. With several players the weaker players tend to gang up on the one who's ahead, and such shifting alliances tend to keep things on a more even keel.

I've only played a few times, so experience may change my assessment....

Evolution is a cute game of tableaus that teem with rapidly evolving critters.  There may be too much luck for most serious gamers.  A pair of dice decide how many units of basic food are available each round, and the high variabilty makes for a wild ride.  You know that most of your critters will starve, but can you happen to have the most high-scoring ones survive what turns out to be the last round?  It's luck on luck and may be a better fit for smart kids.  Try 3 D4s instead of 2 D6s.

You play your cards as animals or traits on your already played animals, then have your animals survive by being able to feed them round to round when everyone has passed on playing cards.  Game goes until the deck runs out, then your remaining animals and their traits are scored for points at the end.  Its a very engaging and interactive game since some of your created animals have a chance of eliminating your opponents animals through various traits you played on your animals (such as the carnivore trait).

AWFUL!  Extensive House rules needed to even make this playable, but why waste the time?

I didnt know any other Russian board game publishers other than Zvezda maybe and had no idea that the level of games coming from that part of the world could be that high!

I got the game yesterday morning, a friend came over to play in the afternoon and by now we have already 7 games in!:D
Totally addictive game and the best deck building game I ve tried up to now! Fast paced too which requires minimum setup time. We were able to play a game in starbucks this morning while having a coffee with my friend (the 7th one:p). 
The game itself is designed by a guy that has a PhD in evolution biology and is made so that it can teach such a hard to understand field of science to elementary school kids.
Very few elements are random and effect everyone in the game the same way. 
If you like balanced games and to apply logical decisions to plan your winning strategy, then this is a game made for you.:D

Highly recommended

The issue I have with the game is that in two player games if one of players gets an advantage early in the game it is very hard for the other player to win.

This is an extraordinary card game.  Very well worth the purchase.  The expansion just makes it better.

A light game that overstays its welcome by a half an hour.
Horribly swingy and too much luck of the draw.

very chaotic, rich-gets-richer problem and king-making with more than 2p, ... don't like it.

[+] original theme...
[-] no artwork. Way too long for what it is...; Always play a limited number of rounds, otherwise it can take forever!

Наиболее вероятно, что я напечатаю эту игру. Может быть любопытно добавлять собственные карты-свойства. Да и говорят коробка в игре ужасная.

I reckon' it is a really interesting game, it is a impeccable simulator for being a specie creating god, while the game balance is perfect too. The only BIG problem is when you're trying to teach someone the game who never played, they will likely to be scared and afraid it is too academic.

A missed opportunity, this game could be great, but it suffers from some bad design decisions. Plus, you have to print a VERY long FAQ as the rules don't cover many areas of the game. Still, despite my low rating, there are some things about Evolution that can be enjoyable.

What's the point of 30-45 minutes of activity when in the end only the last turn (or maybe two) matters?
In one game, one player won in the end with 1 (one) animal on the table.

Catchy little card game playing Mother Nature and evolving critters. The feeding phase is too random and seems too simple BUT this would easily grab my attention in grade school during free time about the wonders of science and biology.

ゲームとしては荒削りだが、展開はリアル。
生物学やってた人ならうなる内容。
環境の変化や生物種の発展、得点方法などを練り直すと化けるはず。
もったいない。

これを指して『地雷』とか言える人は確実に生物学の素養がない人なので対象外です。
本当に展開は生物学的に正しい。

After one play. Good use of theme. Fun game except for runaway leader, the last turn is the only one that matters, and you might not get any cards the last turn.

Rating tentative and may change. Very fun in some ways, and I particularly like how it represents the forces of natural selection. But it's pretty random sometimes (realistic, but can be frustrating) and there can be runaway leader issues, especially with fewer players.

My rating comes with the caveat that I play with some house rules regarding scoring during the game when certain events occur and scavenging order.

Perfect connection of game mehanic and theme. Building up creatures with different traits is cool. Lot of different strategies.Best Russian game I played!

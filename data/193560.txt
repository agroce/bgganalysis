GAME: Escape the Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor

RATING: 7
Great fun for the entire family! Our kids (ages 5-13) loved this game and are bummed that it can only be played once and then it gets passed on.  We will definitely be purchasing the next one that is coming out.  The clues weren't too difficult to frustrate the kids, and it kept them engaged the entire time.  We completed everything in less than 90 minutes and escaped the room.  The only thing I didn't like was the circular tape they used on every clue and envelope.  I will be replacing them with Velcro so it is easier to open and reuse.  Other than that small aesthetic complaint we loved the game and the team work that it needed to complete it in time!  Now time to pass it on. :D

RATING: 6.5
Relatively easy fun for 2-3 people, but would be an absolute car crash for more than 4 players. Cool idea, moderate execution, but would be embarrassed to bring this game to the table for 5-8 players. It's honestly playable as a solo game without much more than a gateway level challenge.

Not a bad escape in a box game, but not the best either. The components are quite good, the story is OK, the puzzles are a bit too easy for four adults, all of whom happen to be good at puzzles.

Clever first box-approximation of live-action escape rooms.  The game is pretty well-designed and the components are cheap, but functional.  I can never play it again, but it can be repackaged for other groups of friends.  For a veteran gamer and "escaper," this game was quite simple: 30 minutes to solve when given 120.  Recommended!

These types of consumable games are fun experiences, but because of their one-time use I have to rate them based on how much I enjoyed the experience and whether I'd like to have that experience again.  This one was essentially timed puzzle solving with theme, and it was fun to go through it as a group.  We made it through with a lot of time to spare, so it was probably geared more toward a family experience.  I enjoyed it and look forward to the next escape room-esque adventure.

I was disappointed by the components of the game. We had issues right off the bat with the 'solution wheel.' After some tinkering we determined that not all of the punchouts had been removed from the inner layers of the wheel. After fixing this and getting on with the game, puzzles were repetitive and too straight forward. I also did not like that there was only one puzzle to be solved at a time, and since each of these puzzles was rather hands-on it did not work well trying to play with a group. We completed the whole game in under 20mins. This game may be better for younger players.

Puzzles are a little on the easy side but a very fun little game. The publisher is doing themselves a real disservice by saying the game is for 3-8 players as it plays perfectly well solo or with 2 players. There are not enough activities happening at the same time to keep 3 or more people really involved, so it seems like the player count is way off base.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game does give an experience of cooperative problem solving ala escape rooms.  For that, I give big kudos.  The reason I don't rate this higher is (a) you can only play it once, and (b) the puzzles were easy enough that we completed everything in under an hour.  If you know another group that likes these puzzles, you can each buy one of the games in the series and then swap, since the game can be put back together for another group to try.

I would strongly recommend playing it.  I will probably arrange to reset my copy and set it up for others to play.  However, it is a one-and-done type experience.  If you can appreciate it for what it is, it is excellent in this capacity.

Really cool Home Escape The Room experience. Has a similar feeling of the real Escape Room but at home. The game can be only used once, and we solved it in one hour. I played it with 2p, and I think playing with more than 3 could be hard, because puzzles are solved one by one and if there's much people will be a mess. A great experience! Much fun!

RATING: N/A
Fun 1 shot puzzle that simulates the whole escape room phenomenon. Having done a couple of escape rooms in my time, this was obviously more abstracted than the real thing. Basically, you are solving puzzles to "open" rooms (envelopes) that give more puzzles until you reach the final puzzle. Brian and I zipped through it in about 30 minutes without too much difficulty. I think I will put this back together (quite a challenge in and of itself!) and give it to a family member for Christmas. I can see this genre getting more games with tougher and more complex puzzles in the future, and I'm all for that!

(KIDS) This is not a complex game, but it does work very well with kids.  My wife and I played it with our three children (ages 13, 11, 8) and everyone was involved for the whole game. We all contributed. I suspect a group of gamers, or even just 1 gamer, would likely solve this quickly. It took us about one hour and my wife and I held back a bit just to be sure our kids had plenty of opportunity to participate.

We will buy and play the next one.

This was fun, but much simpler than we expected. There were two adults and our two nine year-olds. We let the kids do everything with only a few little nudges from my wife and I and we finished in 55 minutes. The kids love puzzles though, so this was perfect for them. I might actually have been slower if it were just my wife and I doing it .

We played with 6 people.  None of us are "expert" puzzlers but a few of us have done a live Escape Room or two.  We read every scene and solved every puzzle in under 50 minutes.  The components for this game are AMAZING and the puzzles (while relatively easy for us) were ALL GREAT AND FUN.  This was COMPLETELY worth $20 that I paid for it and I'm going to enjoy watching another group of friends play through it while I observe.  I strongly believe that 8 people would be a big mistake.  I recommend 3 or 4 people as a great group size.  I think this would be very fun solo or only for 2 people as well.  There is no reason that I can see that "3" should be the minimum number of players.  That isn't required at all...

Excellent room escape game, the puzzles were varied and well thought out, the only down side to the game is that it was very easy, and with me, a 13 year old, and an 11 year old we finished the game is under an hour.  I look forward to other games in the series but they seriously need to up the difficulty for these to catch on.

A fun little escape room. Whilst the puzzles are not too difficult, it still had an interesting narrative to go along with it. This can easily be a fun start to an evening. I would not play this with over four people, with three at the sweet spot, as there is not that much to do. besides the puzzle in front of you.  
Had a lot of fun tackling this.

Our group loves real escape games (and puzzles generally) so we felt like we just HAD to check this out - even though it's pretty clearly aimed at a younger group.

...I guess this would be cool if you were a younger group. We finished it in about 25 minutes out of the 90 allotted. Really, there's nothing here for adults. And the fact that all of the puzzles rely around one central puzzle wheel was a little disappointing. Oh well.

RATING: 6
Components: Interesting artwork on each of the envelopes. Fun components. Somewhat interesting narrative.

Experience: Too easy; easiest of the escape room games I've played. So easy that whoever is reading the narrative out loud misses out on the puzzle solving, because the others can solve the puzzle in almost as much time as it takes to read the narrative. The instructions walk us through how to solve the first puzzle, and they don't get much harder after that. Also, the outer wheel of the solution wheel never needed to move; after solving one puzzle, it was always in the correct position to solve the next puzzle.

Like other escape room games with only a single puzzle to be solved at a time, it's difficult for multiple people to manipulate the objects; one person manipulating them typically obscures them with their hands.

Too few puzzles to solve.

Ranking this high not because I think this is a perfect game that can't be improved upon, but because it was a unique and very fun experience with wife and kids. Some of the puzzles aren't very hard, but they were perfect for the 10 and 13 year olds. I don't care that you can only play once. It's the same price as a single fast food meal and certainly less than taking them out to a movie.

Pretty decent Escape Room game, though I'm not entirely sure why they say there should be a minimum of 3 players.  You can totally solo this without issue, especially given the 2-hour time limit.

We destroyed this.  It took us under 50 minutes to do everything, including the final optional puzzle.  As far as escape room puzzles go, these were the least challenging, both comparing to the real deal and comparing to other similar escape room games.  If you've never done these things before, this is a great place to start, but for those experienced with the more dastardly-style of puzzle, you'll find little challenge here.

The good news is that the rope puzzles that plague the Gravely set in this series are not to be found, so there's a lot less frustration here, and of course, the best thing about this series is - unlike the competition - that you can carefully repackage it and find it another home.  

Natrually this is a double-edged sword as you don't quite have the same kind of tactile feel of re-arranging materials to get through the game and I think this might account for why the puzzles seem so... elementary when compared to the competition.

Still, if you're going to play any of the games in this particular series, I definitely recommend going with Stargazer.

Fun, but the puzzles are pretty simple. Our group of 4 beat the game in 55 minutes. You're given an initial budget of 2 hours, and then a choice at the end, which resulted in us being given another 30 minutes to beat the final puzzle. We did the whole think in less than 1 hour.

Comment:
A solid, completely resettable escaperoom game with nice high quality components,
BUT
The puzzles are rather simple and not challenging at all.
Most of the puzzles feel the same.
The background story is cliché and stays shallow - no need to dress up (as suggested in the introduction booklet).

All in all I would recommend this only to people who haven't heard anything about escaperooms before. For some of them it my be a good start. The puzzles are straightforward and easy to solve. Better suited for children.
But definitely not a "real" escaperoom event at home, lasting about 90min as stated on the box (30min is more realistic)!

According to BGG's rating descriptions, I don't believe Escape the Room: Myster at the Stargazer's Manor can be rated higher than a 6 simply because the game has a single solution. Unlike legacy-style games, whose outcomes can change from playthrough-to-playthrough, Escape the Room is a purely-linear gameplay experience. Players are presented with a number of envelopes - each of which represents a different room in the manor and on which is a puzzle that must be solved before the envelope can be opened. Inside are further puzzles that, when solved using a 60s-style decoder wheel grant players access to further puzzles and rooms until the game comes to a close. Along the way, players are guided by small paragraphs of text and the occasional supporting document or hint that slowly unveils the mystery behind the manor.

My group of four completed the game in about 40 minutes, despite the original timer being set for two hours. The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, but completion of each was generally satisfying and the anticipation for what lay in wait in each room maintained our interest and the game's momentum. While the game suggested 1-8 players, I think more than four would have seen half of the group sitting without anything to do. Only if each player was allowed to solve a single puzzle could I see the highest player count work and even then, the enjoyment of the game would have been severely diminished.

The game's components were well made but nothing to write home about. Throughout the gameplay, no components needed to be permanently altered, so the game could be re-packaged and handed off to the next group of players with minimal effort. The game is adequately-priced, though I think most players 10 or up could have completed the story solo so if you're most concerned with bang-for-your-buck I'd recommend playing the game one at a time instead of as a group. That said, the price tag of around $30 was far less than a physical escape the room game in my city, and the experience took approximately the same amount of time.

Overall, I'd recommend the game to anyone who enjoys solving puzzles. The game is best as a solo or two player experience in order to keep everyone involved at the same time throughout the game. While the game is a one-time experience, it was worth the money and I look forward to passing it on to someone who will enjoy it as much as we did, and hope they pass it on to the next group as well.

I like puzzles, but Escape the Room was kind of a disappointment. First off, the rulebook encourages you to "play harpsichord music" and "ask your friends to wear period costumes", but the flavour text really doesn't do enough to paint a conceivable story, even one that fits into the science-fiction genre. I would have been embarrassed to throw a dress-up dinner part with this as the centerpiece given what you get. Also, it states it's for 3-8 players, but more than 3 would be ridiculous as the puzzles are not designed for that many players. This would even work great for 1 or 2 but even at 3, players are fighting to get in on the experience. I have absolutely no idea why ThinkFun would push this as a party game.  When you get into the real meat of the puzzle, it's all stuff you've seen before: tangrams, mazes, even picture matching (like, what you get on the back of a child's placemat at a chain restaurant).  The game isn't sold as a kid's game and yet most of these are kiddy puzzles.  And there's a giant contraption that you have to build that does really nothing interesting other than visual appeal. And all of this and you have to accept this is a "one and done" concept (which fortunately you can re-sell because you don't destroy any of the contents).  I think there's room for games like this as the "Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" format has proven popular for crime and puzzle solvers.  And I know there are games that try to do this better. But the "Escape the Room" series doesn't do a good job selling itself to repeat buyers for next editions if this is what they think constitutes an interesting experience.  Still, it wasn't overly boring or broken. It plays and it can be a way to have a good time with friends, as long as you keep the play count to 3 or fewer. Honestly.

Of course, it's a one-time deal, so the rating doesn't match BGG guidelines, but more of a general, how well did I like it sort of thing.

I played this with my wife, and we finished with plenty of time to spare. Fairly easy as escape rooms go? I wouldn't recommend this for a big group, like the box says. Two people sounds about right, MAYBE three. Nothing particularly creepy or spooky, pretty family-friendly. A good experience for, say, $10, not so much for $20.

The puzzles were a little on the easy side here, but it was still a fun ride, and it had the best components of any tabletop escape room I've tried (Exit, Unlock, Escape Room: The Game, Deckscape). I played with two and it worked fine--I can't imagine playing with more than three, as there is usually just one puzzle to work on at a time, and it doesn't get much easier with lots of people providing input.

Barátomnak köszönhetően 3 fős társaságunknak lehetősége nyílt kipróbálni a játékot. Életemben nem jártam meg szabaduló szobában, de a játékról eddig készül ismertetők elolvasása során állandó jelleggel megjelent ez a fogalom, mint összehasonlítási alap.
A történet is ilyen formán kezdődik: csapatunk az elhagyott csillagvizsgáló rejtélyét kutatná ki, amikor is ránk záródik a virtuális szoba ajtaja és limitált időkeret áll rendelkezésünkre megfejteni annak (és a benne található tárgyak) titkait, egyben kiszabadulni. A nyomozás (szabadulás) lépéseit a játék dobozából előkerülő borítékok sorozata jelképezi. Az aktuális feladatot teljesítve tovább tudunk lépni a következő felé, egyben megismerjük az elhagyatott épület rejtélyét, történetét is.
Le szeretném szögezni az elején, ez egy „egyszer játszós” gém. Nem fogod elfelejteni a megoldásokat maximum több évtized alatt, így többet játszva az élmény határozottan csökken (illetve csökkenhet, mert nem visz rá a lélek, hogy újra játsszak vele).
Ennek ellenére – amíg a piac nem telítődik, ha telítődik egyáltalán – érdemes családoknak, baráti társaságoknak kipróbálni, majd használtan továbbadni, eladni, elajándékozni, hogy mások is kipróbálhassák.
Mi a játékidőn belül kijutottunk, megfejtettük a titkot, de a történetről nem mondanék semmit (bár nincs benne Csutulu, se zombi, se viking, se vámpír/vérfarkas).
Határozottan élveztem az együtt gondolkodást és a könnyű kezdő rejtvényektől a nehezebbek felé haladást. Az utolsó kivételével gyorsan rátaláltunk a megoldásokra és annál is bőven a megadott időkeretben voltunk. Próbáltunk arra is odafigyelni, hogy mindenkinek legyen lehetősége rájönni a rejtvények nyitjára (bár néha igen nehéz volt nem beleszólni).
Az egyszeri használhatósága ellenére szívesen ajánlom kipróbálásra. Az pedig még kérdés, hogy a kiadó következő ilyen játéka mekkora élmény lehet, milyen más típusú rejtvényeket tettek bele vagy „kopipészt” más témával az egész.

RATING: 8
Kellemes szórakozás. Négyen játszottuk végig, és ha nem is agyégető, de mindenesetre elgondolkoztató feladtok voltak benne. A kivitelezés szép, bár 1-2 alkatrésznél látszik a kínai kivitel :-(. Összességében megérte, főleg, mivel a végigjátszás után tovább lehet adni/ajándékozni, hogy mások is kipróbálhassák.

Gave away since it can only be played once. Games like this are hard to create. The puzzles have to be challenging without being so esoteric that you need special knowledge to understand how to solve the puzzle. Stargazer's Manor does an excellent job of presenting challenging puzzles that most people should have no trouble understanding how to solve. (The son-in-law had never done a tangram before! so we had to explain how they work.) Overall, it was an enjoyable experience.

This is a series of puzzles rather than a game, but it's a fun way to spend time with the family. The puzzles feel challenging but are not too hard, and there are online hints (which we had to use for the final puzzle). Our kids (ages 5 and 7) got caught up in the story. You can only really play through it once, but you can pack the whole thing back up for friends to enjoy, and the publisher's website provides instructions for doing so. We'll definitely be getting the next one in the series.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2017)

I love escape room games. I have played all the Unlock! games (I won’t buy the Exit series of games as you need to permanently damage the game to play it)  and I think they are great! So I was very keen to play Escape the Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor, but it was such a disappointment.

The rules of the game are pretty easy to teach, you can do it in less than a minute. The game tells you it is for 3-8 players but I think it is best for 2 players. It is a VERY simple game. You can play it in less than 60 minutes.

The game´s components are good as is the art. I really liked to have to tinker and to assemble components to solve the puzzles, it is very different from Unlock! in this regard. Unlike the Exit series of games, you can reset this one, but in each play through the game suffers a bit more and that’s a negative for me.

I like the theme, but the story of the game is lousy and weak.
 
What disappointed me, is the game difficulty. We were only two players and we solved every puzzle very fast, in fact we breezed through all the puzzles without stopping until the end. You can easily solve this game by yourself, with more players it would be a waste of brainpower so I cannot see how the game says it is up to 8 players. 

After we finished it, we felt we wasted our time, there wasn't any kind of challenge.

Bottom line, Escape the Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor is an extremely easy game, thus, it is very disappointing. The puzzles are obvious and easy to solve. I can´t see how the game recommends from 3 to 8 players to enjoy it  I like the game can be re assembled to be played again, but still the game´s component suffer a bit during each play through. I already sold my copy of the game. I´m, obviously, not the target audience for this game so I won’t buy anymore games in this series.

I'm a big fan of escape rooms so for me this was an easy buy. The game is really fun to play but I can't say that the thematic feeling was that strong. The puzzles where nice but not that challenging. For me and my brother, the base game took exactly 40 minutes to play and 4 minutes for the additional challenge. As we now have played it to the end, there is no reason to keep it as it is a one time experience. However, it is really good that the game is easy to restart (=sell).

Remek hangulatú szabadulós játék. A ThinkFunk amúgy is élen jár a logikai rejtvények, feladványok terén, hát most összeraktak néhányat, és kanyarítottak köré egy jó kis sztorit. Azt kell, mondjam, igényesre sikeredett. A magyar fordítás is kimondottan jó, hangulatos lett. Egyedül a 3-8 fős megjelölés előtt állok egy kicsit értetlenül, mert technikailag végül is 1 ember is játszhatja, de persze értem én, hogy hangulatilag más, illetve funkcióban is inspiráló, ahogyan másokkal megbeszéljük az ötleteinket, gondolatainkat, halljuk a többiek próbálkozását. Mindenesetre nagyon sok fővel, kizárt dolognak tartom, hogy mindenki érvényesülni tudjon. 2-4 között lehet az igazi szerintem. Azt mindenféleképpen figyelembe kell venni, hogy ez egy egyszer játszós történet, de mivel minden darab teljesen funkcionális, továbbadható másoknak, így az ára is elfogadható. Mi ketten játszottuk végig a feleségemmel, igazán remek élmény volt, gyerekes családoknak (mondjuk 8-10 éves kortól) is bátran ajánlható.

I liked it - I really liked it. Nice mix of puzzles and it was fun to solve this with my wife. And actually this game is best when you have max 3 players, because all the game pieces aren't that big and if you want to be part of solving those puzzles, then there can't be that many players. It's fun to watch, when other teams are solving this Mystery (I've been in that position twice).

And if you're thinking if this is same kind of experience than the REAL room escape experience... the answer is: no. There isn't that much disinformation or situations where you have to find clues,... but still this is fun.

Really fun, seems like this version might be more suited for families with a younger crowd. The puzzles were fun and interactive but were a bit easier than I had expected.
I played in a group of 6 (2 didn't really participate much) and we solved it in just over an hour. 

It was VERY enjoyable and I look forward to future releases!

I'm a huge escape room fan.

This at-home experience is ok, no more. Easy to the point of being almost trivial, mostly uninspiring, and pretty short (our group finished it in under 30m, including a pause for dramatic reading of each new story piece). 

Yet somehow it was still enjoyable and worth the small price of entry. just don't expect too much.

For a better overall experience, try Mr Boddy.

We decided to try the Escape Room in a box. It was an interesting experience. The concept was great, and the puzzle solutions wheel was absolutely amazing. But the puzzles were SO obvious. For at least half of them, two of us could have the entire puzzle solved by the time the third person finished reading the flavor prompt card. We did the entire thing in less than 30 minutes, including the optional extra part in 5. There were basically no red herrings, and everything was just super obvious what you were supposed to do.

So, yeah. Not a fan. I would never spend money on this. I would play the future ones, but only if they were store copies because I'd never spend anything on it or let friends spend anything on it. We had the minimum number of people (3), and we absolutely destroyed it.

This is a fun experience, but here's what you need to know:

- If you're gamers, this is a couple's game.  Or it could be solo.  3 would be fine, 4 is definitely max.  So this does make a great pair of couple's game.  The limitation is that everyone is basically working on things at the same time, and you need everyone to be crowded around the puzzle to be engaged.

- The game is easy.  You are given either 90 or 120 minutes depending on player count.  In our case (2 couples) we took well under an hour to solve everything with the best possible result.  Avoiding spoilers, there is a final puzzle which we completed in about 10% of the time allotted.  This was with 2 gamers, one super casual spouse, and another total non-gamer spouse.

- There is nothing PG-13.  Heck, it's probably G rated.  Very good game to play with your kids or non-gamers.

- The game is fun and it is well done.  The time flew by, and while it was rather easy, it was a very enjoyable experience and I wouldn't hesitate to buy the next in the series.

My first experience with an Escape the Room game. It was okay. I had heard that this was one of the easier games in the genre, but I did find myself getting frustrated towards the end. I just don't like puzzles for the sake of solving them, I guess. Some neat and innovative ideas are here, though I don't know if it's worth the price of admission. I imagine that doing one of these at a convention or something would be a lot more fun. As it was, I thought this was an interesting experience. Definitely nothing I'm looking to pursue in the future, but decent enough while it lasted.

A fun cooperative puzzle game. Unfortunately, this is a "one-and-done" game, which means once you have finished it, there really is no replay value! Combined with the fairly simple puzzles, I can't honestly recommend it at the going MSRP. If you can find it cheaper though, it can provide an enjoyable (if short) experience for a small group to work though.

Game was tossed due to non existent replay value.

With my kids, this was a 10 experience, but you can't really repeat it.  The puzzles were interesting and not too hard.  We mostly just nudged, and our 11 and 9-yr-olds loved the puzzles.  Our 7-yr-old had fun too, though he needed a little more nudging.  Our 4-yr-old helped turn the wheel and open envelopes too.  The story was fun and a little different than we expected.  We finished the main story in about 1:10, including some arguments about who got to solve what, and the final challenge in about 10 min.  We packed it all up with the instructions on the website and have two different families that we are going to share this with.

"Solid escape room with a series of puzzles. All were fair, and there was enough theme to hold the abstract puzzles together reasonably well. It is is solvable with 1 or 2 players, and 3 would probably be fine too. You can play without destroying any components (other than breaking the seal on envelopes)."

What I like:
- Challenging but fair puzzles
- Can play without destroying
- The theme was present, and fun

What I don't like:
- The "3-8 players" on the box is wrong (1-4 or perhaps 6 would be better)
- The puzzles could have used more variety
- A logical thinker can end up dominating the game
- At 90-120 minutes, it's a bit longer than might be ideal

This is my first escape room experience of any type. I more or less knew what to expect, and this met those expectations.

As 5P, we played this. We had all done real escape rooms previously & personally aren't really my cup of tea. 

The game gives 2 hours for 5 people. We completed the first section in only 35-40 minutes (out of 120), then it reset for 30 minutes once we hit an certain objective. We finished that last piece in about 10 minutes.

Fun & well done, but was not near as challenging as we thought it would be. Or maybe the timer should just be shorter.

A nice attempt at one of my other favorite pass times, escape the room games. Since this one comes in a box they were limited to what they could include in the box but still did a good job of creating some cute puzzles. The story is typical of what you would expect and overall I think I would prefer to go to a real escape the room game or even a Puzzled Pint evening, but we still had fun. The scenario was fairly easy making it short, but we were also 6 playing thus with so many someone is bound to figure it out. Best to play with about 4 to get a challenge. You also can't play again, but you may be able to pass it to another group if you don't write on it.

Escape the Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor is a timed, cooperative puzzle-solving game that is designed to mimic the experience of an Escape Room attraction.  The game presents the players with a number of puzzles, the answers to which are dialed up on a decoder wheel to see if they're correct.  If correct, an envelope is opened, containing another puzzle with the associated parts.  The rules overhead for the game is very low, as the puzzles (and theme) are explained on a notecard in each envelope.  Because the puzzles are static, the game can be only played once--a large part of the game is figuring out how everything works.  However, the company's web site does provide instructions to re-pack the game for use by another group.  On the whole, I thought the puzzles were varied and interesting, but definitely on the easy side.  The game says it plays up to 8, but I think that would be too crowded.  It's a fun experience.

Una aventura la mar de chula para jugarla con niños: se meten completamente en el papel de detectives. Para adultos resulta demasiado fácil, pero guiar a los más pequeños para que resuelvan el misterio es una experiencia muy grata.

RATING: N/A
90mins 10+ 3-8 (Best 3, Rec 1)

Consensus in the comments is this co-op is best at 1-4 as the puzzles are presented in a linear fashion, rather than the standard parallel solving in real escape rooms.

Having played EXIT Season 1 (loved Pharaoh, liked Cabin, hated Lab), I bought this to play with some casual gamers at work, despite the touted 2 hour time-frame. I need not have worried as we completed this in just 42 minutes. It is a vastly easier and better produced game than EXIT and looks aimed at a light/social/family audience. Only one of the puzzles slowed us down a bit and that was because we over-complicated it; no need for the online hints. Also, very glad I can reset this without much fuss (although my 3 EXIT games have now been played 7 times between them, without re-buying). Light but fun introductory Escape-Room-in-a-Box.

Not great for larger groups due to linear nature of puzzles but can be "paused" to come back to later which is nice. Should be easy enough to reset so that it can be given to a new group to solve when we're done.

Compared to the "EXIT" row this game can't hold the level. Although there are some nice abstract riddles and the layout of the game and its components is good, it seemed to be easier and thus not compelling enough. You shall not getting bored in this type of game designs.

We were so stumped when we were first set out on our own, with no more direct clues.  Good thing they have online help.  Very well thought out game.  Kind of a one time experience, but you can't go wrong with the price, considering what "live" escape rooms charge.

This is an amazing accomplishment. It was also our first escape room board game. I could trade it away now that we've solved it but I am so impressed with the quality of its components and how they fit into the tiny box that I decided I needed to keep these types of games in my collection.

RATING: 8
3/14/2016:  Escape The Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor was a lot of fun.  The story line is a bit tenuous, but it’s whimsical, cohesive, and family-friendly.  The puzzles weren’t very difficult, but that really depends on the skill level of players involved.  I could see this being a really engaging and challenging experience for a family with younger kids as the game allows plenty of time to play play and figure it out.  The game components are nice and I like that there are actually no “pen and paper” puzzles typically found in these types of “puzzle hunts in a box.”  Instead, the puzzles are a nice mix of the typical escape room types of hidden clues, logic puzzles and hands-on activities.  That having been said, this game was very linear and puzzles had to be completed one at a time.  This means that some players might not have much to do and therefore not necessarily fully engaged the entire time because with only one puzzle to solve at a time, it just isn’t necessary or practical to have everybody participating at once.  I prefer when there are multiple puzzles that need solved simultaneously so that everybody has something to do.  Again, this configuration is probably okay though since it may actually be necessary for some players to help others during the game depending skills.  

For what’s in the box (both the components and game play experience), Escape The Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor is a fantastic value and the publisher even includes free game reset instructions online so that the owner can host a game night for others or the game can just be passed along to be played by another group.  The Solution Wheel is a really clever “unlock” mechanism that provides the extra little bit of tension as the code is dialed in and everybody awaits the result.  My only real “complaint” is that the stickers used to seal the envelopes are EXTREMELY stuck on, so trying to remove them inevitably damages the envelopes which is disappointing since the game can be reset to be played again.  I wish that the publisher would have used some other type of enclosure such as metal hasps, string ties, Velcro, double stick tape or even REMOVABLE stickers so that the game components could remain undamaged after the initial play.  If the plan is to keep the components nice, then I would suggest using an Exacto knife to carefully slice all of the sticker seals open first and then use removable labels (e.g. Avery brand removable) to reseal them.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game experience and would highly recommend Escape The Room: Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor to people that enjoy puzzles or “escape the room” games.  This and other games like it have been great additions to the different kinds of games available and more like them will become available as escape rooms continue to grow in popularity.  To that point, ThinkFun has already announced the next game in their Escape the Room series titled, Escape The Room: Secret of Dr. Gravley’s Retreat, and I’m already excited about it and am really looking forward to playing!

Really had fun with this. Excellent theme was set up well with each scene card. The puzzles were also good, some fairly obvious, others required that 'eureka' moment. Although when looking back, it's all there in front of you!

Played 4P and each of us definately contributed to at least resolving one of the puzzles. In all took about an hour to complete.

Looking forward to further releases from Think Fun...

I wish it was built a little more solidly.  That said, I guess they designed it to be burned after one play.  My friend smartly did not destroy the contents so it could be enjoyed by further people.  I like this series well enough, although Unlock! is my favorite.

Our group had a great time. It says up to 8 players but 4-6 would probably be better. We finished with a good bit of time to spare. If you have experienced puzzle solvers, I'd suggest reducing the time by about half an hour--possibly even an entire hour if you want to feel more pressure. Can't wait to play the second one.

RATING: 8
While you won't be able to replay the game yourself, none of the pieces are destroyed so you can play host for others or lend it out/resell it.  

I was surprised to find that even though the box says 3-8, we played with 2 and were happy we did. Unlike some live escape rooms, this was pretty linear and mostly had to go puzzle to puzzle. That would make large numbers of people unwieldy as you wouldn't all be able to "operate" the same puzzle at the same time.  I would actually say this works best 1-4 and works VERY well for pairs. 

The multiple reveals as you open each envelope and find new items is super fun. The puzzles are pretty easy for anyone who has played point-and-click adventure games or other similar activities.  I bet non-puzzlers will have a problem figuring out how to start one or two of the puzzles.  The final puzzle tests how well you've been paying attention over the past hour. 

Overall, very happy with this and hope the series gets harder and brings bigger and more gimmicky 3D puzzles to the mix too.

This is a great family experience for a home Escape Room experience. 

I played with my wife and two kids (6, 9) and they were able to play along and help solve puzzles as well as the adults.  Challenge was just right for the group I was with, and I could see it working the same for a group of adults.  Definitely keep the group smaller, as too many hands will make the puzzles seem small in comparison.

Had to play it solo. Got it from a thrift store so I didn't know if the pieces would be there. It's a good mental exercise. I now reuse it as a team building activity for whoever will become the new captains of the sports teams I coach. I coach three seasons so it sees a lot of use. It's always enjoyed and a good thoughtful experience.

It's a series of spatial puzzles. Would play fine solo or with a group of up to about six. Some of the puzzles are very easy (only requiring that you pay close attention). Some are more clever. Be warned that you can only enjoy it once (although you can repackage it and give it to a friend).

Well, well, well...
I won't rate this, because that is heavily linked to the replayability aspect, and this is a one-time-only-experience.
Sounded fun (i love irl escape rooms), and it was a nice game, but very few thing could be done in parallel, so i would not recommend it with more than 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 6
I had fun but it was much too easy. Also, never play with more than 2, 3 at the very most. Half the group will just idle, take turns and solve it in smaller groups if you are many players. We played as 2p and didn't get stuck for more than a minute or so at worst. And most of the time the solution was almost blatantly obvious. It is still interesting and has a lot of nice things but the difficulty needs to be ramped up and the price for a new game with only one 35-60 minute scenario is just awful when Unlock! does 3 scenarios with total 3-6h+ of playtime for the same price. We had just finished the first series of Unlock! games the week before and much prefer that level of difficulty where you actually have to be an alien to make it within the time limit and without taking hints.

Bought this to get ideas for a mystery escape room themed party I was planning and also to use with my gifted students at school.  I ended up using one of the puzzles for my party and also think this will be a fun activity for my students.  I think it is a bit easy for adults; we played 2P and I don't think it would have been as fun with more.  For kids, I think 4P would be a good group size.  It would be kind of hard to involve more since the puzzles progress in a linear fashion and you can't have people working on different puzzles simultaneously.  Overall, a great implementation of a mystery escape room.

RATING: 7
I like that it's reusable (to pass on to another group), even if not at all replayable. The physical components were ingenious, but I felt like there was a missed opportunity for various difficulty settings. As it was (and avoiding spoilers), all but one puzzle was very easy, and the one that wasn't was difficult in an arbitrary way (not an interesting way, but more of a "were you paying attention?" thing).

But pretty cool overall. We enjoyed it as a family.

Way too easy. Puzzles have very little depth. I played with 3 players and even that was too many players since puzzles could easily and quickly be solved by one or two players.

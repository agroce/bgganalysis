LIKE: Quick game but a big decision tree. It was fun to block other players, and I see this being a large part of the interaction. Looting did not hurt much in the end. The mancala was a nice puzzle-ish element, and it had room for exploration.
DISLIKE: Can end up being some min/maxing at the end. Managing your resources and flipping land tiles can get a little fiddly. When a player thinks through their options, resources are forgotten and left scattered around. Player boards could have had an "in use" area.

OVERALL: A good game, but lacks a huge punch to get it through the other games demanding attention. Could be the theme that lacks punch? Maybe. Rating could rise after more plays.

RATING: 7
It has a classic feel in mechanics - mancala mechanic in dropping resources up a tray is nicely done and gives this game some planning. It can be quite mean in how you deploy your tents and use looting to cut off others. The components are really marvelous and the board variety is in set up. So over all, decent game and feels good to play.

A solid game. Gold West is clearly a Euro in that you are managing resources and trying to control a geographically variable set of regions but the theme shines through in play as well. From the mancala style gold sifting track you use to channel precious metals and building materials you discover in newly settled regions to the "most wanted" status you acheive for conducting too many raids this game not only runs like clockwork it feels like a western themed gold mining adventure where you are exploring, and using the resources you gain to build, settle, and gain influence in the local boomtown. There is also enough player interaction to ditract from the typical criticism of a pure euro that can feel like paralel solitair. The game is also an easy learn and even easier teach. The rules are well written and the design as polished as a new shiny nugget. Pick up a copy pardner!

Mechanically, the game centers around a mancala mechanism where resources are placed before becoming available. This  mechanism forces players to plan ahead so that they can optimize the resources they have. Once players obtain the resources, the game is essentially a point-salad with numerous ways to score VP. And like many point-salad games, there is a very strong race element. But because of the great components and ease to scan players' boards... you can really deduce what others players are attempting to do. Thus, players are able to make calculable decisions on whether to race for one goal or another. 

This game feels most similar to a medium-to-heavy Stephan Feld game. But because of its very simple/streamlined rule set, the game defines eloquence. Overall, I'm very impressed and can see this game going higher in my rating (and I rate games very critically).

Excellent, pretty meaty little point-salad Euro that plays in half the time of similar games. Contains the perfect blend of strategic end-game scoring goals and turn-to-turn tactical decisions. I love the area-control aspect of the board, the mancala-managed resource mechanism, and I appreciate that the rules are very streamlined and easy to remember. The game's short length and sheer ease of play really elevates it over other games of this weight.

A well-designed point salad type game, where you can do all sorts of things that are all worth points in various ways. There's some good game-to-game replayability here since there is an abundance of cards and tiles, only some of which you'll use in each game.

However, I didn't feel like there was a "hook" here that made the game particularly exciting or unique. Everything in the game is standard "spend these resources to get these points" or area majority-type fare. It all comes together nicely and the various parts interact well, but with nothing truly unique or innovative, the game doesn't stand out to me.

Overall, a good design, and while I probably wouldn't suggest it, I'd happily play if someone else wanted to.

This shares similarities to Kingdom Builder, although I like this better.  Kingdom Builder is more gateway than this, as this adds a mild Mancala element and deeper decisions with selecting where to build to get specific resources.

It reminds me of a Feld game.  With the Mancala aspect Trajan comes to mind, but it has that point salad feel with cubes thing going on.

Pros: Quick play time, easy explanation, decisions need to be well thought out and meaningful, exceptional component quality

Cons: Dry theme, probably will take a few plays to see strategies

It's a good game but need more plays to see if it is something I will keep in the collection.  Hopefully the dryness will subside too as I understand the game more.

Definitely a Feldian design as just about everything you do gets you points every turn. The mancala type resource generation is a neat twist on how you collect resources and the modular setup of the board and ways to score points makes for great variety. However, after 1 play I am not entirely sure what to think about this one though. It really needs another play for me to see if it is worth keeping. I feel like after 1 play I would rather play something like Five Tribes or Deus over this one. It's a solid design just nothing that really stood out.

Resource management and area control lead to the scoring of VP in this game. Players place camps and settlements on the central board in order to mine for copper, silver and gold, and to gather wood and stone to build new camps and settlements. The camps and settlements are placed on hexes of 4 colours (yellow, orange, grey, green), corresponding to 4 tracks which give points to the 2 players with most influence on these tracks at the end of the game. When they place a camp (worth 1 influence) in return for 1 wood or 1 stone, or a settlement (worth 2 influence) in return for 1 wood + 1 stone, they also receive the resources (2 or 3) from that space. These resources are placed in 1 of 4 spaces on the players' personal gameboard. If you place them in the space worth 0 points, you can use these resources in the next round. If you place them on spaces worth 1, 2 or 3 points it will take more rounds for these resources to be available, because you have to move the resources up to and out of the 0 space, dropping 1 resource in every space you pass on the way (when you have 4 resources in space 3, you will have to drop 1 resource in space 2, space 1 and space 0, and will only be able to use 1 resource in that turn). Gold, silver and copper can be exchanged for VP in particular combinations, or they can be shipped along a resource specific track, allowing players to take VP along the track. When you are faster than the other players on those tracks, you can take more VP. With a combination of resources special Boomtown investments can be made, allowing players to reap VP at the end of the game for e.g. the number of your camps and settlements along the water. There are also VP for the largest area a player controls. Quite some ways to earn VP in this planning game.
Do you feel like a miner in the Wild West? No. It's a euro with a theme painted across the game mechanism.

Rated after 3 plays @ 2 players

It's a light area control, resource allocation game about mining during the 1800s. The supply track is a simpler version of the Trajan mancala track since resources actually leave the track, letting players reset the state of their board. The components are top notch and rule book is very well laid out with the one exception being the final scoring of land types. Once explained, players tend to pick up the game fast. The rating may rise when played with a higher player count and the board gets tighter. 

[29 Dec 2017] - 7 (5 plays)
Sold this game after a few more plays. The game was solid and fun but the high dependency on area control for points made it less than tense with 2 players. At that point it's mostly a game of random draws looking for the valuable mineral tiles that you need.

RATING: 8.5
First play was 2-person. Tight game. Second play was with 4 people. The point system is solid. Very tight race. Final scoring really brings the game to life for a fantastic finish. 4 player game was difficult at times to keep track of what to do, as your turn happens once every 4 times—someone could potentially ruin your strategy. But that's gaming. I enjoy this game and am glad I have it in my collection.

I dig Gold West a lot. After two solo plays à la [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qCj8w_Th8A]Rahdo[/url], I can only say that I'm pleasantly surprised by this game. It's refreshing to play a game which can be taught in five minutes, a welcome exception in these days. In that sense, Gold West has a very classic feel to it: The actions you can take are not difficult to understand, the depth comes from the implications they have.

In some way, Gold West reminds me of Kingdom Builder. Where Kingdom Builder uses special actions as the engine of the game, here you have the mancala-style resource management. Both need to be utilized in the best way possible to make the most of the ever changing scoring opportunities. Sure, there's some Feld thrown into the mix with the various ways the game throws points at you for just doing stuff. Maybe this could have been done in a little more subtle way, but I'm not complaining.

Kevern is a criminally underappreciated designer. He is a master  of mid weight, quick playing, simple rules yet a nice depth. A bunch of decisions to make in Gold West surrounding how to collect your resources and how turn them into victory points.

Euro point-salad with mancala resource collection. There's a few different ways for players to collect VP throughout a 10-12 turns.

Die Regeln lesen sich zunächst überschaubar und bekannt, ja fast langweilig. Wie man sich doch täuschen kann: GOLD WEST hat eine unvermutete Tiefe und Dichte. Der simplen Mancala-Mechanismus stellt sich als durchaus kopfkratzig heraus und muss trotz TRAJAN Experience erst einmal im Denksieb des Goldsuchers untergebracht werden. Auch das Ressourcenmanagement hat es in sich: Wohin möglichst effektiv mit dem wenigen Gold, Silber und Kupfer? In den Postkutschen-Trail investieren? Nach Boomtown, um in der Endwertung zu punkten? Oder doch auf die Auftragskarten schielen? Und Stein und Holz zum Bau von Camps und Siedlungen braucht man ja auch. Fucking damned Shit! Goldrausch ist ein karges Land. GOLD WEST ist Jack Londons enges Höschen in, auch in puncto Spielzeit. Allzu schnell rauscht der kalte Bach der Zeit vorbei, dem Spielende entgegen. Die variablen Punktetreiber machen aus jeder Partie ein neues, frisches Abenteuer. Vor allem die Endwertungs-Legeplättchen in Boomtown are very great. Mancher wird in der Euro-Eloquenz von GOLD WEST wieder einmal die Themenbeliebigkeit beklagen. Für andere ist GOLD WEST ein selten gewordenes Beispiel, dass es keinen Regelalmanach braucht, um ein herausforderndes, knackiges Eurogame zu sein, dass auch im Kopf bewegliche Gelegenheitsspieler zu begeistern vermag, die dem Lockruf des Goldes folgen. GOLD WEST ist nackt betrachtet wenig innovativ, aber in der berühmten Summe mehr als die Summe seiner Teile. Die alte Schule lebt. Vertraue niemals einer Spielregel.

Oddly, I thought I would enjoy this more with three or four players, but it was more fun with two for me.  I felt like it was much easier to do some planning, and the game length was better with two as well.  As one of the players pointed out, the gameplay mechanic of moving the resources up each turn makes little thematic sense, and while it doesn't break the game, it is a little odd and very tough to wrap your head around for the first play or two.  I enjoyed the game, however, and definitely look forward to playing it again.

It's a fine enough game, but nothing about it really jumped out at me. Timing the conveyor belt of resources is ok, but it's a logistics puzzle that can really mess with you if you're not careful from the get go. 
One of the biggest issues for me is that the board is too small, the pieces are cramped and the Boomtown bonus tiles are difficult to read. I am sure they made it smaller to make the game cheaper, but I think it would really have benefited from an upgrade in size of the board. Everything else is nice and the graphic design is good.

A game that can best be described as Euro-Lite. It's got recipe-fulfillment; a shipping track that, plain and simple, gets you points; a bonus tile area you can control for game-end scoring; stock market domination; route building; a bit of a mancala-style system for resource management; a bit of punishment for not meeting turn requirements; and a dry theme too boot! 

Whew! Looking back on that, it doesn't seem Euro-Lite at all but, for any moderately experienced gamer, Gold West will be far from overwhelming. It's a pleasant, quick game, that is fairly easy to both teach and learn, and it'll be a nice stepping stone for gamers looking to go beyond TTR, Catan, Takenoko, etc.

Instant favorite! SUPER underrated game. Should be on Top 50 on BGG. It's super easy to teach to new players, even non-gamers, its super fast (60 min 4P tops!), has enough meat and choices to always be interesting, has above average replayability and you never know who won until the very end! Perfect!

RATING: 7
Even though it's an extremely straight game, the simple mechanism makes it a very interesting game. Combine this with known stuff like "longest street", "adjecent to..." or just "majorities" and you have the whole game. Really simple, but yet very clever and it seems to offer enough different strategies (needs more plays).

In the spirit of the 90's and without a 50 page long rulebook, like it's common nowadays!

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro abstracte de gestió de recursos. Els punts es guanyen a partir de complir certs "contractes" i de col·locar cases en un taulell tipus Kingdom Builder. La gestió de recursos fa servir un mecanisme tipus mancala que té bona pinta.

Excepte el mancala, la resta del joc em sembla molt poc original, al final es tracta d'aconseguir recursos per poder construir més cases que et donen més recursos i fer-los servir per guanyar punts. Prescindible, el jugaria si tingués l'oportunitat, però no el buscaré activament.

An highly strategic points-salad that feels like a Feld (that's a compliment).  The game is built around an intriguing conveyor mancala.  The lack of "special powers" makes the game a bit dry.  The game ending is usually tight.

RATING: 7.1
The heart of the game is a mancala aspect of how to move resources off your personal board to do actions/fulfill contacts on your turn.
Player interaction is some blocking. Has a similar feel to Five Tribes in the mancala aspect of manipulating pieces and can lead to some AP. The AP isn't as bad as Five Tribes though because you can at least plan your turn before it's your turn and other players cannot affect your player board.

Always gets interest from people at our club and is highly likely to see play when brought down.

Has a nice mancala mechanic for resource management and is relatively simple to learn.

Plays in around 1 - 1.5 hours depending on new players.

Overall, a good "semi" simple game, but has enough depth and variance of tactics to keep interesting after multiple plays.

Really great game, and probably simple enough for almost anyone to play while making the decisions non-obvious and generally really interesting. I always really enjoy mancala mechanisms in games, and this one, while small, packs a good punch. I also like how your choice of location has so many different implications because it impacts so many different things. On the one hand there's the question of which resources you need the most, but also the color of the tile is relevant for end game terrain type scoring and the location of the spot is relevant for other end game scoring. And then there's the question of how to use the metals, there are three distinct ways to turn them into points and they all seem really interesting and solid. Really amazing how clever and yet simple this game is.

Great, fast-playing resource management game. I've played this with a variety of groups, it works well surprisingly well for new gamers as an introduction to light-medium Euro games. The game is a good length even with 4 players (about 50-60 minutes) which is great for a game with so many tactical options on your turn. The resource management aspect of the supply track is still challenging even after many plays. The theme is approachable and the area control aspect of the board fits the theme well. Definitely one of the my favourites of 2015 and the production quality from TMG is great, the cardboard is thick and very nice. Although thick player boards would have been better.

The Mancala-like mechanic in Gold West is devilish in its apparent simplicity.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Feels like typical TMG fare - the perfect 6. However, the rating could rise and I am looking for a couple more plays before making a final determination. It does have several interesting paths to gain points and one cannot do everything   - one should likely specialize. The Trajan mechanic is interesting - am curious to explore this more and see if using the 3rd box can be made to work. The town tiles are interesting as well and those are definitely not created equal.

Short and fairly original game. It borrows elements of Trajan (mancala-ish) and Macao (delay resources for bigger gains).

After my first play, I have a suspicion that every path is so balanced, that no matter what you do, you end up scoring about the same amount, and you win by luck or extracting minor, minor edges repeatedly.

I was originally really smitten with this game.  The pace was nice, overall game length was great, and decisions were light but fairly interesting.  Components are excellent quality.  Setting up the mancala-style boxes adds some extra decisions and planning, and the various scoring options work well.  Sadly after just a few plays I've kind of fizzled out a bit.  It's still good, but it has a very point-salad feel and it just ends up a being a bit too light to demand numerous plays.  With this theme, gameplay, and presentation, I just really want it to be deeper.

The game is very well designed, very smooth and it's fast making it an accessible game for newcomers but also very engaging to experienced gamers due to the "Mancala" mechanism present in the game and where to go Mine next...

I really liked the game, it's nothing mind blowing but it's a very good one, I wouldn't mind adding it to the collection but it's crazy expensive in Europe (the cheapest I've found costs €50) so I'll wait to see if I catch this one on a future sale.

RATING: 9.5
Streamlined, sleek, euro goodness..
The Area control element, coupled with the boomtown scoring mechanic is an improved Kingdom builder.
The mancala-style supply track mechanic is an interesting puzzle, short term or long term gain decisions have to be made each turn..
The end game scoring adds enough tension to make this game have a climaxing end..
This is a light to medium game, quick playing, quick teaching/learning..
I wish it had more crunch, another element added to the game to make it slightly heavier..
But it's a great game for what it is..  
Edit: Have now played this with a 3 player count.. Excellent, is my conclusion.. makes the area Influence and boomtown elements slightly harder to manipulate..And a higher player count does not increase the game's length to much as it's soooooo smooth playing..

a hard one for me to rate. I'm not a fan of the encampment mechanic, reminiscent of a Kiesling/Kramer/Knizia abstract, nor do I like area majority scoring.

Overall a mixed bag, not one I'd be too keen to play, but it's not an utter disaster for me (Hacienda, Kingdom Builder)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoyed my first play, the second play not quite as much and then my buddy who owned it ended up trading his copy. I can't say that I'm anxious to play again, but also wouldn't turn down a play. It lands squarely in the average category for me and there are plenty of light medium Euros I'd rather play in it's place.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Gold West hits the perfect sweet spot when considering depth to play time. Our game wrapped up in 60 minutes (not including the initial rules explanation) and offered a divergent group of VP scoring opportunities to explore. The game has a great flow to it, turns are usually quite snappy even though it has a mancala aspect to getting goods. Gold West also has a bunch of end game scoring tiles you compete for (each space can be occupied by 1 player token) which will dramatically change how you play each game. Only 4 tiles are selected for each game, so similar to other games I love (Agricola and Snowdonia), every game played will see players focusing on different strategies while also having to make sure they secure the end game score tiles they want. There is also plenty of player interaction throughout the various aspects of the game because you are all competing for the various goods, point scoring opportunities taking place on the central board. This is not a multiplayer solitaire game.

Overall I would consider Gold West the perfect gateway game to Trajan (a game I love, but isn't in my collection due to how heavy and long it is). The fact that gold West has much stronger thematic integration between the various actions will make it much easier to get to the table. There is planning that goes into setting up your resource mancala, but it doesn't melt your brain like Trajan.[/i]

A nice mid-weight Euro with a few games in it. I really like the mini-Mancala mechanism that forces players to choose between allocating the resources you gather onto "quick" spots for no points now but quick benefit in the various VP races, or onto "long term" spots which offer the tradeoff of getting extra points now and bigger turns later. This tempted me to up the rating, but in the end I suspect that even though this decision making is interesting throughout your 10 turns, each playing may end up feeling a bit same-y given the game is a relatively themeless accumulation and spend of resources, which is of course a heavily traveled path.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One game only. I like it but have some reservations: 

- there is no room for more than one coach on the race track. How do they expect this to be played with four? This is poor design. The board is not even that big. They could have made it a bit larger, and allowed more space for the pieces. 
- mancala mechanism is NOT as good as trajan's. First, we never used the '3' point space. It takes too long to get your pieces, and since this is a race game to get high point tiles, the incentive is to place your pieces on the zero or the one box in order to get them faster.  The extra thinking required in order to properly plan moves where you use the three box  of the supply track doesn't seem to mesh with the complexity or style of this game,  which is to play fast and get your pieces fast. In our game we ended up using the zero supply box 75% of the time.  I started to wonder if we missed a rule but I don't think we did. 

-  I love the variable set up for hexes, tile placement, boomtown track, and investment cards.  Guarantees a different game every time.
-  The game pieces, the coaches, the miners, are nicely designed and look great.

Wife said "meh". Perhaps it gets better on multiple plays where you start to see more strategies? It better, or else it's off to the trade pile.

Great mid weight euro that is more than the sum of its parts.  If you take the game apart, each piece is very "been there done that", except for the action/resource track which is itself is a bit of a streamlines mash up of the mancala in Trajan and the windrose in Macao(an astute observation by Rahdo).  But somehow when all the pieces are put together, you have a unique and engaging game for fans of this type of euro.  Add to it that the game is the perfect length for what it is and you've got yourself a keeper.

The game has beautiful components, although there's a minor issue where the scoring trackers don't really fit on the scoring spaces when multiple players share a space. Unfortunately, the essence of the game is about being 'firsties'. I'm reminded of how in many Feld games there's that one element that gives points to the player who accomplishes some task early vs the lesser benefit of someone who built their engine and scored the feature later. This game applies this same idea to nearly every mechanism, but the engine building element seems nearly completely missing from the other half of that equation.

The first player to grab a card gets that card's reward and bonus (plus the cards don't refill). The first player to move their car past a marker gets a bonus. The first player to claim a spot gets that spot and those resources. Only the first and second players to claim an endgame scoring criteria gets to score for those things. 

At the end there are some points in terms of majority scoring, but they are uneven and uninteresting.  One possibly interesting choice this game has you make is when you collect resources from the board, you place them in this Malacca box. If you place them in a box where you won't be able to use them right away you get some extra points. I think this is meant to be the engine side of things, but it feels underutilized in this game where 'firsties' is so heavily rewarded.

A wonderful, short game about gold mining in California in the 1850s. It feels like a shorter and easier version of Trajan. There's the mancala, the resource management, and also the various areas to spend influence points. Short playtime within one hour is definitely a plus.

[ESP] Euro de peso medio-ligero con reglas simples en el que hay que ir construyendo campamentos y asentamientos para obtener recursos diferentes de los cuales al final de la partida se dan bonus para quien tenga mayoría por cada tipo. Implementa un pequeño mancala para ir administrando los recursos y cada partida cambia con respecto a otros bonus y las cartas de contrato. Simple de reglas pero con diversas estrategias en cada partida.

A solid medium-light euro. The mancala resource track is the big highlight of the game, allowing players to plan ahead while still being able to react to changes on the board. All of the different investment cards and Boomtown tiles create a ton of variability in strategy each game.

Overall, Gold West feels like a much lighter game. Easy to teach and fast to play, but no lack of meaningful choices. I can only see my score improving with more plays.

This is a very thinky game with lots of choices and ways to earn points. It does seem like some are better than others though and some balancing could improve that.

We really liked this game.  It is a good, light, quick Euro game. It has interesting resource management mechanics and a fun theme.  However, it seems like there isn't a lot of room for pursuing different strategies.  We found ourselves doing things the same every time, and just making tactical alterations depending on what was available.  In the end, the simple strategy in the game just wasn't enough to keep us interested after 5 plays. Planning to trade away.

This is a great game for those looking for a Catan +. Easy but deep enough rules, a very well implemented mancala system and hexes, to not break familiarity for the aforementioned  Catan fans looking for something meatier. The diverse paths to victory, different town tiles and the fact that there is no dice rolling going on open the horizons for newer players and add to the replayability.

wanted to like it, it has good parts (mechanics, I mean--nothing good thematically here. awful name--what is this, a game about Kanye's little known failed MC cousin from Ohio?) seen in various other good games...but it just doesn't jell into anything distinguishable from the crowd. kind of...meh, ok. nothing special. a lot of the mechanics seemed just like ways to disguise who was winning, make it hard to calculate. Which is...ok, I guess. fairly point salad-ey. most things give you a few points. don't think I'll play again...unless someone else really wants to and there's nothing else within arms reach that's better.  And I'm too tired to go to the shelf and look for my copy of Stone Age or 'gric. Then I would probably say "what the hell, this is an ok game, let's do it".

Gen Con 2015 buy. Not sure how many copies they had but probably less than 50. Lucky early snag.

9/8/2015 Played for first time tonight and it was a blast. Love the variable scoring and variable investment cards. Our set up felt a bit like Kingdom Builder with end game points for being near water and contiguous settlements. GF scored 18 points for influence track on territories. I feel like we did poorly. Only 1 investment card completed and no last bonus tiles for shipments gained. Also only 4 influence in Boomtown. Lots going on this game and a ton of replayability built in. Random tile starts seemed a bit building material poor forcing a bit of looting this game. So much going on in this game and a lot of strategies. I'm sure we were very inefficient. Can't wait to play with 4. Thanks much for a great game, Alex! 

We even had fun doing a bit of live tweeting and posting pics. This is the kind of game that leaves you thinking and contemplating what your attack plan will be next game! And then likely the scoring and investments will be completely different and viola you have a whole new puzzle to solve!

Based on my geek rating and comparison to other rated games looks like this one jumps right into my top 10!

Played once with 3P. As a point salad Euro with a mancala-like mechanism at its core, Gold West is a [thing=102680][/thing]-lite of sorts. The primary difference is that the mancala here does double duty as a means of accessing resources. A minor difference is that there is a 12-round limit to the game, which places psychological pressure to be as efficient in each move as possible.

It's fairly quick and simple, yet well-crafted and quite the challenge given its depth.

Not the most inventive game, but consistently enjoyable. I do appreciate the mancala-driven action-selection mechanism that requires careful planning to utilize well. Boomtown and it's variable end-game scoring adds much needed differentiation from game to game. 

It's easy to teach, plays under 90 minutes even with 4 players, even if some players are a little slower. Interaction is limited to a variety of "race" conditions for scoring tokens and board position. 

If I have one hesitation, it's that the shipping track seems quite powerful given how much easier it is to score versus most of the other game mechanisms. But because it's easy to score there, it's also easy to contest. I would just hate for every game to become a shipping race while other key mechanics were skipped over.

It's been a while since I played a TMG title that I really enjoyed. Most of them are fine, but few are great. This one is one that I would think would have worked just as well as one of those HiG games. Streamlined rules and game play with a good dose of strategy and tactics. It has choices that are interesting enough without being too hard for the occasional gamer yet not shallow. A very nice ballance. The result is a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 6
Excellent example of a highly polished, circa-2015 point-salad game for the masses. Feels very similar to Scoville in the way you score points, save for the very different Mancala mechanism. Plays surprisingly quick, with most turns (you only get 12 total in a two- and three-player game) taking well less than a minute. There is some room for strategy, especially as you learn how to best position your resources along your track for maximum profit. The component are high quality, and the theme provides an enjoyable touch of wild west, gold rush era charm. Overall, this feels like a very pleasant optimization game that plays quickly and provides just enough opportunity for interesting optimization goals.

Despite the game's claim at scalability (including an adjustable map size), I found that player count was a significant factor in my enjoyment. With two, the game tension was low, especially with new players. There wasn't enough competition for land. With three, the game is better, but I wonder if scaling the map up wasn't a mistake. Perhaps three players on the smaller board? In any case, with a full complement of four players the board is much tighter, with a stronger sense of tension. With four, the race to claim investment cards matters. I was also happy to see a few players using a Looting strategy. With another play or two, my rating may go up. Experience may also be a factor here, as each play saw new strategies and tighter gameplay.

I have high hopes!

Really good Euro of "mining" to collect metals to ship for points, trade for an Investment card or to buy a building in Boomtown (for end game bonuses) or stone/wood for building camps and settlements for end game scoring. Quick playing, solid game that should have pretty good replayability as the board changes from game to game with the modular game board and tons of different end game bonuses in Boomtown.

[q="THoiA's Thoughts]This game works pretty much alright with 2 players because the scaling of the board size to keep things tight.  Granted you get to occupy more of the town spaces so scores will be higher and the races for the different resource deliveries is not as tight with more players but the game functions well and is fun.[/q]

Gold West is a game about mining in the Old West, although the theme can largely be ignored. The game is fairly straightforward, but I think that lets you focus on the gameplay, which I liked.

The game is largely about putting mining camps or settlements on the board, which gets you metals or building materials, and then spending metals for points. There's points for everyone's largest contiguous group at the end of the game.

On your turn, you do three things. Activate your supply (get resources you've previously banked), spend metals for points in one of three ways, and build/loot.

Anytime you get resources in the game, you put them in one of four storage bins. You have to put all the resources in the same bin. You get points for putting resources in bins that are farthest from your usage area (0, 1, 2 or 3 points) but getting to use resources from bins that are farther away is more difficult.

So when you activate your resources, you take all the resources in one bin and move them towards your usage area, leaving one resource behind in every bin you pass. Anything that makes it to the usage area is available for this round, but you can't keep anything from round to round.

There are three ways to spend metals. First, there are investment cards that require certain combinations of metals and give you points and/or abilities. Second there's a stagecoach race for points. And finally you can build in boomtown with two metals (which vary depending on where you build). All those actions let you get points for metals, and it's hard to get screwed... but also a little tricky to efficiently get points. You'll definitely need to plan ahead.

Finally, you either build a camp or settlement or you loot. Building a camp requires a wood or stone. A settlement requires wood and stone. If you have neither, you're forced to loot. Regardless you'll pick a tile and take the resources on that tile. You can only pick a tile that has already been revealed (which just means someone has already picked a tile adjacent to it in a previous turn). Tiles are broken into four types: gold mines, silver mines, copper mines and forests. The tiles will always have at least one resource of their type (and probably more), and sometimes one or more resources of a different type. Tiles always have either two or three resources on them.

If you build a camp or a settlement, you put a tent marker on the board and then place the tile on your player board. There's a majority contest for every type of tile. Settlements are better than camps in that they give you an extra credit in the majority contest and ties are broken in favor of the player with the most settlements.

If you're forced to loot, you immediately lose a point. And while you still get resources, you discard the tile, so you're not using it to compete in the terrain majority contest. Additionally, you don't place a camp on the board and you put one in the "most wanted" area. At the end of the game the players with most and secondmost tents in the most wanted area will lose some points (1 per tent for most, 0.5 per tent for secondmost).

And that's the game. Like I said, there's not a ton of different stuff going on (although there are various ways how you spend metals), but that really forces you to focus in on the few things that it does have. It was a lot of fun and the game was really close and competitive. I'm really looking forward to playing this more.

In a lot of ways it felt like a hybrid between an old school game with simple straightforward gameplay that is surprisingly deep at times, and a newer "get points everywhere" game. While it does have a lot of ways to get points, it doesn't really feel like a "point salad" game as there are only three things to do on your turn. And even when you are converting metals to points, there's only three "areas" to choose from, and a large part of your focus in the game will have been figuring out how you plan to get metals into points. This certainly isn't a game where you just randomly get points for doing anything.

Initial play is positive. On paper, the game offers multiple paths to victory that thematically makes good sense. Unlike Feld's point salad mechanisms, the scoring paths in Gold West are more integrated with game play and feels intuitive. Except for a few quirks in scoring (such as bonus points for first 5 contracts received, why?) the scoring paths are solid and well balanced. There are a few unique elements to the game. I like how the end game bonus point tiles are arranged in a square and randomly assigned costs based on a coordinate system. The tiles can be arranged in any order and also in vertical or horizontal direction. Empty spaces are filled with victory point tiles. It is neat that the costs could be randomized in this manner. Another relatively unique element is the resource allocation and utilization.  Resources are distributed in a chain with movement of goods flowing upwards. Inspired by Mancala, goods are dropped off at each box and those goods that exit the chain can be used as payment for services. This element represents the most strategic and complex part of the game. Successful allocation of resources means uninterrupted flow of actions and efficient use of resources each turn. Further, he turns are rapid and the flow of the game is smooth. Overall, this is a pretty good mid-light Euro design.

I'm on the fence with this one.  

When I first read the rules and the positive reviews I was a bit excited.  Seemed like a "classic Euro" in the sense that it would be easy to learn, fast to play, but offer depth.

It is all those things, but I walked away feeling a bit meh.  More than one person has posted comments about this having a slight Feld feel.  When I saw those words it kind of nailed my feeling.  I'm not a Feld fan.  I think he makes solid games, but they mostly feel cold and detached for me.  But it's not that they're abstract.  I love K&K designed games and a lot of them aren't thematic either.  But I just don't feel the coldness in their games.  Here I do and I just can't explain why.

This past year I feel like I'm just playing mere shadow variations of Five Tribes or Istanbul.  Felt it in Scoville and now a little with Gold West.  All of them have a Mancala (Istanbul more a "Mancala vibe") as a central mechanic.

On one hand I feel my rating should reflect the quality of this game even if I don't enjoy it.  On the other hand I just can't give a high rating to a game that feels so cold and detached.  This is a 6 for now.  If (and that's a big if) I give this another play I might change this rating and these comments.

Edit
Three plays now and can't say my impression has improved much. Very easy to remember set-up and rules. But the gameplay is just so detached. I do think it's the Feld vibe of everything making points.

Prospecting in the old west for area control, resource management and influence in Boomtown. Smooth play centers around a mancala style management and timing of your available resources for your next moves. Almost like a deposit in the ATM or saving in a CD for a little victory point interest. The camp placement system is engaging. Use stone and lumber to place a camp and expand your claim around the lake. Or, loot your neighbor if you can't. Spend metals on investments, gaining influence in Boomtown, or to sell to market. The looting is interactive but it comes at a price on a negative victory point condition.  The game elements and victory paths are fun and work well together.

Gold West is of my favorite gateway plus games, if not my very favorite.  Turns are fast and there are several choices you have.  The game has a great flow to it that allows players to just sit back and enjoy the mechanic.  The mancala style movement of resources is simple but effective.  There are several ways to score points but not too many.  This is one game that my wife absolutely loves and that I greatly enjoy as well.  The art and graphic design is top notch.

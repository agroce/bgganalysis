A short card drafting game with some good mechanics that feels like it should play better that it actually does.  Why am I not as excited about turn order, and my card choices, as I could be, or should be?  Not sure.  Perhaps the interaction level in the game was insufficient.

A pretty vanilla drafting/card placement game where players use cards to build a pyramid along with its accessory buildings. The game is about trying to get the right cards for your buildings via a simple drafting mechanism, and placing those cards in a way that maximizes your points.

Overall, the game is mechanically fine, but doesn't really stand out or do anything exciting.

(Purchased at Meeplecon for $10) A worthy addition to any collection. The game feels a bit like Imhotep but without the take that aspect. Building your pyramid over 10 rounds is the main objective followed by building obolisks and tombs. The scoring aspect is interesting and players really have to keep track of their glyph and color combinations. A great game with staying power and sure to hit the table a bunch.

Interesting card placement, drafting sort of game where each of your three areas (pyramid, tombs, and obelisk) all score in different ways making evaluating the cards on offer interesting as you can place them anywhere.
I like that some cards have two stone and some have three stones as number of stones is an important factor in many of the scoring types but three stones are harder to place well.

A little bit multiplayer solitaire, but otherwise a fairly enjoyable filler

Surprisingly good.. even with two players.  She loves Viceroy for the spatial aspect of it and this seemed like a quick card version of that.  It was and didn't disappoint.  We enjoyed the puzzly nature of your card choices and role selection.  This is a quick filler with not much depth but enjoyable for what it is.  Magnetic box from iello is aesthetically pleasing but I would prefer a telescoping box.

An entertaining filler, Pyramids has you drafting cards to either place in your pyramid, obelisk, or secretly in your burial chamber. All three location score based on a different type of set collection requirements. Likely best at 3 or more players, it is fun collecting and building. Pyramids doesn't shine quite as bright as Biblios, but this does look better on the table. It is also fun to build the structures throughout the game.

RATING: 7
Simple but ingenious Euro card game with balance of scoring possibilities. Two main parts of the turn - choose when you want to pick your pair of cards for the tun (earlier gives you the card you want, later allows you more play options but you have to make do with what the others leave you), then play (or hold) your cards.

Sometimes you have to jump in and get the perfect card (but you can't do that every time), sometimes you have to go for the multiple play options. Scoring is interesting, but only the tomb scoring allows much player interaction.

For every player, a pair of cards is turned face up in the center of the table. Players draft a turn order card that also determines your actions for the turn. The earlier you go, the less you can do. In the new turn order, players draft the card pairs and add them to their tableaus, which consist of three sets that combine and score differently. Cards are divided into 2-4 different sized sections, each of which is one of six colors. In your pyramid you try to place cards so you are stringing sections of color together (largest sections of each color score). In your Obelisk you are trying to add cards so that one of the same color is on every card placed and in your tomb, which is face-down, you are trying to stash more sections of a single color. You always add a card to your pyramid, but your turn order dictates whether you can also add to your tomb, obelisk or both. When the pyramids are complete, the game ends and all sets are scored.

This is a very basic game that probably won't excite anyone, but neither is it terrible. It's about as "meh" as a game can be. Plays quick and can satisfy a sudden craving for card drafting and set building, if you ever get one.

Neatly produced and compactly packed family game with a classic theme choice. Reminds me of another contemporary game, Dokmus, due to the action selection pool and similar level of AP.

The turn order choice, and the three ways to play cards, make this a super tight small game that I love to play. The Pyramids, particularly, are puzzlier than you'd expect, and the balance between specializing and reaching the 5x3 bonus is a tough decision.

This is just a beautiful to hold, gorgeous to look at, simple to learn, and easy to play great filler game. With surprising amounts of both tactics and strategy. Different paths to victory mean players will be surprised by the outcomes of games. Scales well, though plays most fun at 4-5 player counts. A great game for the price.

Fun drafting game with some hidden info as you play things under your tombs, and light strategy that doesn't crush your soul. Easy to pick up on and enough turns that you can come back from things even if you don't start off in a great position.

[b]Pyramids[/b] was traded away in a math trade 12/12/17. (Received Dream Home Christmas promo)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm still not sure how I heard about Pyramids because it seems to be flying under the radar. A few plays in and I'm really enjoying it. Game play is brisk, decisions are meaningful for what is a relatively simple game rules wise. I am a huge fan of spacial puzzles and Pyramids has some of that in it's game play as you build the different buildings, with the pyramids themselves taking center stage in the puzzle department. Scoring is a good mix of scoring the features you've built [i](pyramids and obelisks)[/i] and majorities versus other players [i](the burial chamber)[/i]. 

Pyramids has been the biggest surprise for me so far this year based on how little I'd heard about it and how much fun I'm having playing. Bonus points for the box having the magnetic lid a la Biblios. The balance between the decisions you make and play time is perfect. Pyramids gets a recommendation for me as a great filler/family weight game that also plays well with two.[/i]

As long fillers go, this is decent. It's a set drafting game. To play well, each round you need to analyze what sets the other players will likely want. If they probably won't take the set you want you can afford to take a lower rated turn order card - later choice, but you get to play more cards out that round. If others will likely want your desired set(s), you'll want to take a higher rated turn order card that gets an earlier pick but plays out fewer cards. That's the game in a nutshell, repeat for 10 rounds. It's more work than I want in my fillers, and the game is more enjoyable if everyone only glances at other boards rather than studies them so as to keep the game moving along at tempo. Nothing mind-boggling, but enjoyable enough for what it is.

Set collection game while building a pyramid. Hard to control the cards you will be acquiring and placing. I found it harmless enough and really pretty simple. Family game for sure and might be a bit long for what it offers. I wouldn't play with 5 people but I would definitely play it again but probably not for my collection.

Wanted to like this more. Game looks great. But it kinda just felt like I was working on my own thing (even though you can draft against another player, it felt like it hurt you too much to do so), with cards that really didn't go well together (it was hard to line up much in the pyramid, most I got was a group of five of one color at the end).

In the game I played, the scores were so close together I wondered if the game really rewards different strategies or if it just kinda ends up a wash in the end.

Choosing a god tile was a little annoying, because there might be things I really wanted to do but be prevented from doing so, and that felt more annoying than interesting.

I'd be willing to play again, and I'd like to play with more than two players, but right now, I'm a little disappointed.

1 play, 2er

A simple, quick action-selection/set-collection game. Probably better with more players, though: with 2, the tomb scoring seems too swingy and chaotic. Clever, though, and should be a nice little filler! I love the book-style box, of course, but iEllo miscalculated with the insert size: the wells aren't big enough to properly accommodate the tiles!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The cards in the deck show 2-4 stones (stones are one of 5 colors), some of which may show a glyph. Players start with 1 card in hand. Each of 10 rounds, several (varies with player count) tiles are placed in Display, along with n pairs of face up cards. Everyone, starting with the first player and going clockwise, chooses a numbered tile. In tile order, players choose a pair of cards and play 1-3 cards (depending on their tile; each shows pyramid +/- obelisk +/- tombs). You must play to your pyramid (building on base above a supporting pair) and may play to the other areas on your tile. After 10 rounds, you'll have finished your pyramid. Score each area differently:
- Pyramid: 
... For each color, score 1VP in your largest orthogonally adjacent group of bricks (single largest group doubles).
... If you scored at least 3VP/color, earn a bonus 10VP.
- Obelisk: find the color present on the most cards, score based on number of cards (1, 3, 6, 10, 15VP)
- Tomb: for each color, the player who has the most bricks scores 5VP
- Score 2VP per glyph placed in the correct (pyramid/tomb/obelisk) area.
Most VP wins!

The game is casual in essence : the strategic and tactical aspects are present, but you basically have to deal with the few choices you get and try to make the best of it according to the luck of the draw. Up to now, it's just perfectly fine. My issue is that every turn, you need to look at cards from all sides and try to see what your best move is, which is time consuming and leads to AP. My game partner and I decided it was long enough to look at all of our respective options that doing the same thing for our opponent would take too much time, but this would have been optimal. 

At the end of the games we played, we could not say we had fun. In a more meaty game, we would have enjoyed considering options, but here, it was just laborious.

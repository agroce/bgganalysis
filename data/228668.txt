The underlying system remains fun to play, and there have been some added elements in this and the previous game (temple of elemental evil), most of which have improved it further. However the miniatures in this one are by far the poorest, low quality and tiny, and the choice of monsters is unsatisfying. Since miniatures are central to these games, that makes this one the worst of the lot, albeit still a decent game.

Since Wizkid took over, the game play got improved. However, the quality of the miniatures, in my opinion, decreases. The sculpt might be okay, but this set and the Temple of elemental evil both arrived with broken miniatures. I ended up gluing and fixing them....

Disappointing and overpriced dungeon crawler- only the most superficial resemblance to a "real" RPG. We were looking forward to playing a lighter take on D&D between campaign sessions, but this did not scratch the itch. 

Somehow this game manages to be more strategically one-dimensional and mechanically bloated: your character will rarely want to do anything during their turn but move and roll a D20 to attack some random donk, but at the same time, a "banker" is required to manage the myriad stacks of cards, tokens, dungeon tiles, and models. Why all the extra stuff, when it doesn't really add that much to the game? Perhaps because the base rules are so bare-bones that the emperor would be quickly revealed as naked without all the bells and whistles. 

Even the two traditional pleasures of dungeon crawling, looting and leveling, are sadly lacking. We didn't encounter any items of note in the first few missions, and since experience isn't gained until after the mission, characters don't often have a chance to gain any new abilities or buffs mid-game. This unfortunately means that players rarely have a chance to meaningfully expand their already sparse decision trees. 

There are better games out there at this price point: Descent, Imperial Assault, and of course Gloomhaven all offer a better dungeon crawling alternative in pretty much all respects. I'd recommend any of those (and even Mageknight) before I played ToA again.

I do enjoy a good dungeon crawl. I like how this series makes a new area each time with the tile draw mechanic. It can also be handled solo. 

I am looking forward to the jungle type theme in this one; feels like a fresh direction

I think I might want to collect this series. Miniatures can be painted (with set in box already as sold). Very immersive, now with campaign system and sets and characters can be combined. It would probably be good to give this a shot at bgg.

Great game! While the mods from earlier games ate subtle....they really improve the overall game experience. Mix in a few house rules and you have a very cool campaign.

Digital version on Steam.

I played the first two games in this series and it never quite clicked with me.  This medium may have been the best way for me to experience the game and find enjoyment in its strategies and not force it to how I felt it SHOULD have played.

The highlight of the series. It won't convince you if you don't like the other titles, but they have almost perfected the campaign system, the monsters, events and traps are more interesting, the characters are fun and diverse. Really really well done by kevin Wilson.

I like this better than the other games in the series (although I haven't played Drizzt). The tile artwork is much better and it has standee terrain.  I like the jungle theme and it has lots of traps that makes the bard a useful character.

I like this game.  I don't love it... but I'll play it with my friends.  Really need 4 players and a GM to run the game...  But the game does run itself... just need someone to place the tiles and traps and treasures and minions.....  It's tough...  I want to like it more, but I think for me, I'm thinking "D&D", so I want some role playing element and this is merely a board game....

Entertaining game with excellent minis.  The way treasure distribution works is unbalanced.  Some characters (the bard) are focused on buffing their allies, while others (the wizard and ranger) are focused on DPS.  This makes for a balanced party, but treasure is awarded to a player when that player kills an enemy.  In my playthrough of this game, that meant that the ranged DPS characters took the lion's share of the treasure.  The rules allow players to trade or give away their treasure, but that only makes the support characters into beggars.  It would be better if treasure gained during adventure were put into a central pool and divided evenly at the conclusion of the adventure.

I enjoyed the game, I especially enjoyed the fact that there are two different sets of dungeon tiles in this box, but I have a couple of nitpicks:
- There is an unacceptable amount of errors in the Adventure Book and even on Villain Cards (way to go, Wizkids!)
- One of the 13 adventures late in the campaign is not playable by 2 players
- The game is way too easy with 2 players, we didnâ€™t even spend a single Healing Surge during the campaign

Smooth combat (you only roll to hit, not to wound or save) that is easy to learn but still has good variety due to the random encounters, items, enemies, and traps. Campaign system is also simple but interesting with decisions about how to upgrade characters and items. Better AI than Zombicide, less character customization than Descent but with similar campaign length (although there are no events between missions).

Standard D&D setting, good villains and nice trap/spell systems. A given addition to the rest of the collection.

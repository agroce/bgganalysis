Another great HABA game. Components are awesome. Rules are easy to follow. Gameplay is strategic and fun. Just the right amount of time, and can be shortened for shorter attention spans. This is a great family game.

A roll-and-move filler with some neat tactical decision making, a little bit of aggression (but not too much) and amazingly attractive components. It's about 15 minutes to play, but I've never played only once in a game night. Great filler game, great with casual gamers, great with kids, and great with a mix of everyone. The board feels a bit sparse with only two players, though. 

Only big complaint: the hugeness of the box makes it hard to bring this game everywhere. I want to bring this game everywhere, so this is a bit of a problem. :)

A good super-light game that I would happily recommend to anyone looking for a roll and move game. I'd play it again.

Very good game to play with the kids.  We did not get confrontational in our first play, though I see how that can add some interest.  That can be dicey when playing with kids, though.  There's quite a bit of luck involved with the dice rolls, but this is a good one for kids to practice figuring out the optimal move with the roll they end up with.  Recommended!

Haba never fails to amaze me.  Their target audience is children and yet I always find joy in their games as an adult.  As in normal Haba fashion, components and art are top notch, and gameplay is pretty stellar as well.  I really like that players are able to pick if they wish to move the explorer or log first.  It's not extremely strategic, but makes the basic roll-and-move formula more enjoyable.

Straight forward and friendly or cut throat and viscous.  It's your choice.  It might be interesting to play teams.  Need to get four alternate color meeples and try that.

Now this is the kind of family game you need to have in your collection.  The components are a 10, the gameplay is fun and has enough interesting choices to keep all players engaged.  Haba does it again.

Fun game with a huge board that greatly enhances the gameplay.  Like too that each character piece is unique.

Jumping pieces not costing a movement space adds some strategy, but rule against separating logs from their neighbors somewhat limits options and feels like something I might want to try house-ruling...

Jogo surpreendente, de tão simples que é... Arte muito apelativa, componentes "top" e jogabilidade rápida e fluída, com espaço para decisões interessantes, alguma tática, estratégia a espaços e parasitismo até perder de vista. Enche uma mesa e apetece voltar a jogar e tornar a jogar outra vez!

Frogger the board game. 

With an adventuring theme, huge pieces and roll and move engine. You roll two dice - one moves your people, the other moves logs travelling down the river (which you have to cross).  And you can hop over other people shortening your journey. 

It's amusing, isn't trivial, but nothing too unique. However if kids immerse themselves in the theme and enjoy the big board and moving their big pieces around, it's quite fun.

Kjøpt, men gitt til Kevin. Nå har jeg kjøpt Up the River, og det får holde som elvespill fram til vi begynner å spille Niagara (som TED har på gjesterommet - usikker på om det er ment som gave eller om det er hans/hører til på Ble).

Overall, a great kids game that actually is pretty decent for adults. It's basically Frogger in boardgame form, and it's got some good aesthetics, too. There's some neat ways to move the logs around and jump over other players in order to make some very efficient moves that makes this a solid kids title.

Reminds me of the 'Frogger' video game. (Kinda)

Fun for the kids, adults will be able to enjoy themselves as well.

Light, easy to teach and has great components.

I play this as a filler with more hardcore gamers.

Yet another great game by HABA.

Lots of luck, but my 5 year old loves this game, so it is a winner in my book. It is awesome to see her figure out the best moves.

A really fun kids game, but I believe adults will enjoy it too. The visual aspect of the game is quite appealing. The moving logs, the thick gold coins, the cartoony adventurers and the gorgeous three segment board all lends to a fun experience. A simple and engaging design, I believe this game is a well-deserved nominee for SDJ.

Excited to get this from germany. Simple frogger gameplay but huge board a la Montego Bay - first HABA game: can't believe the thickness of the card and meeples. Takes roll and move a step or two forward for my 4-year-old.

update: definitely needs 3 or 4 to get some jump over moves going. Montego Bay's plastic strip top and bottom would keep the logs in place as they tend to drift around the board with younger hands at play.

One of the few children's games out there that adults will want to play as well. Simple rules that can be explained in a minute, but a surprising amount of possibilities each turn, without becoming too overwhelming. You cannot make a bad decision, but it's not always clear what's the best decision, because of the interaction with the other players. They may block you or involuntarily help you by allowing you to jump over them. There's some luck of the dice involved and half of the coins (VP) are hidden, but I think that's appropriate for a kid's game. The long board is cool but can be a bit impractical with children, but you can move the board around easily without knocking anything over.
Highly recommended.

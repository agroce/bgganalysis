A great family style dexterity game. Simple enough for kids to play, interesting and fun enough for adults too. Another win for USAopoly.

Fun stacking game with UNO card gameplay. Family really enjoys this one.  Maybe the perfect filler game for non-gamers.

Called it United with a tower, and that is pretty much it. Fun little dexterity game that I would play with family.

The name says it all
There's not much game, if replayability is considered, 
to justify the box / price -- though it is really well made.

Would not recommend with more than 4 unless you are very dextrous. 5-6th player in order can have very tough time if good cards are not drawn.

Fun party game, kind of a mixture of reverse-jenga and UNO. It's simple and easy to take places, and there have been exciting and funny moments every time I've played it.

Silly Dexterity game. Blocks are all uneven and hard to stack. It is Uno with a dexterity twist. Same idea as Uno where you are trying to get rid of your cards. If the tower falls over then you have to get 3 more cards to start the new tower. Played with the wrong crowd lead to a meh game. I would try again, but I am not holding my breath. I think there are better dexterity games out there. This one was okay for me.

I want to like this.  The components are great.  The game is fun, but there are some rule issues that make it, well, kinda broken.  Waiting to here from USAopoly to find out if I'm making some huge error.

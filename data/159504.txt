This game has really surprised me.

I missed the KS on the first run but I could not forget about the game. So finally I checked this one out and bought it on EBAY.

This game is the closest RPG in a box format game that I had already played (Shadows of Brimstone comes closest but lacks on a narrative story line).

I really love the mix between group travel, skirmishes and encounters. I really feel connected to me character. The game offers enough surprises to keep you engaged in the story and the whole narration is top notch. 

The only downside that this game has is the D100 combat. It is not as bad as I would think of it at first but the game shines in its story, its character identification and the overall theme. It lacks in tactics.

If you are Ok with that, you will love this game. This game has fired Brimstone for me and is my biggest surprise 2017. It even beats Sword & Sorcery and Gloomhaven for me.

Ambitious but overly fiddly. It has its moments but always ends up involving a lot of metagame player management to keep on track. Footprint on the table is too large, relegating info to character sheets in a boardgame is an inelegant solution to info bloat.
Also there was essentially no proofreading done on this game, typos and poor production quality abound. Nice minis I guess?

This is the best RPG style boardgame ever made. As an old roleplayer, this is the perfect walk down memory lane, and I can't wait for the next game session with my old Dungeons group.
We used to play in Ravenloft setting and this is darn close. Is anybody up for making a Ravenloft mod?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
This game nails the combination of RPG and board game. Many have tried, but the scope and presentation here exceed its peers.

It's not quite as mechanically innovative as Gloomhaven (nor does it have hundreds of hours of content), but it most closely resembles an Ameritrash Gloomhaven mixed with A Touch of Evil. I'm also a sucker for the Ravenloft setting which supports the old school RPG feel of the percentile dice.

There's a lot of stuff going on here and it handles it all smartly, managing to setup and break down relatively quickly. Love the single map tiles for encounters and how smooth the transition is.

Complaints are that I think the stories are only slightly replayable and lose their excitement after the initial run-through, so content is limited. Expansions of course can alleviate this. It's also a price well worth paying for the more focused story content of the game.

Minis, components, and illustrations are all very solid and add to the overall experience. This was a game that saw a lot of attention in development and it shows.

I demoed this at GrandCon.  I'm honestly not sure it has any re-playability.  It's billed as a story-telling game, but is really just story-reading with some hack and slash (using a d100, which means combat results are totally random roll-offs) and a few decisions thrown in.  Once you know the story elements (which, for us, amounted to gaining certain tokens that were referenced later in the game), then you know exactly what to do on your next play-through of that scenario.

I liked the idea of of this game, but this fell short for me.  Much too fiddly in some areas, the different characters didn't seem very unique, and it wasn't as streamlined as it should be for what I think it wants to be - a quick "RPG in an evening" like Descent or the D&D board games.

Comments for 1st Edition Kickstarter: The rules & story book are a hot mess with holes big enough to fly a Dragon through. The games is not playable with just two characters and the designer suggested fixes don't work with just the base game as the "Heirloom" card are not actually included but come in an expansion. After two play of 11 hours total (with access to everything that one could get in the first Kickstarter) I have formed the opinion that the "expansions" should have been (were?) part of the base game and that ,even though the game was 11 month late, the rules are not playable as is. I wanted to like this game soooo much and had very high hopes for it. Initially I was on board for the 2nd Kickstarter, but have cancelled my pledge in lieu of the problems we encountered while playing.

Took a close look at this one and decided that it is TOO close to an RPG. I may as well play an RPG. I have Gloomhaven, which seems to make more innovative use of itself as a board game and 7th Continent is an excellent adventure game. I think I'd rather pick up Pathfinder and run some adventures than pick this up.

Seems like a lot of dice rolling & RPG bookkeeping (i hate). Solo play very difficult and requires 3+ toons. iffy due to many complaints.

Folklore: The Affliction scratches that right itch for an action adventure horror board game.  On the surface it's not overtly complicated, but underneath the hood it has much to offer.  There are character builds, ghostly haunts when your character passes over to the other side, and immersive fictional worlds to explore.  When you play this game you want to play more!  So, if you enjoy action adventure board games, then this is a game I highly recommend that you back when it launches this October via Kickstarter.

Detailed comment follows after more gameplays, actually hyped by the beauty of the rules and the possibilities for shared story telling.
After playing it:
-Great storytelling and sharing
-Elegant rulesetting which is a pleasure to read. It provides enough freedom to act like in an RPG and give your story room to breath.
- The oversized map and the miniatures interwoven with the engaging stories and the freedom to roam this world in a box create a enchanting atmosphere as it is granted by a good DM.
- The world is open for your ideas. If you love to be creative and do not want to be restricted by a tight rule setting this is for you. 
The game unfolds like a flying carpet under your feet ready to carry you anywhere you dream of. It only answers your bidding and is not slave to mechanics and tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is sloppy. The loot system is sloppy. The character scaling is sloppy. The ("encounter") combat system is sloppy. It is pretty much all sloppy.
The story part is nice, and that part works nicely I think. But just about everything else is so uninspired it bogs the game down.

You will spend way too much time on drawn-out combats which require you to roll up towards 100 attacks. You will spend 3 evenings going through story 1 just to realize you did not get any of the loot you need for surviving the next story. Why? Because you have to  roll for loot and the die is whimsical.

And you will, oh boy you will, you will create many, many house rules. Sometimes to fix illogical holes. Sometimes to make more sense of the story. Sometimes to fix the insane difficulty (and it is, I might add, a difficulty that comes from randomness, not the sort you can overcome using skill).

I really wish this game was different. The setting is thought through which is something I appreciate a lot. The stories are fun, from what I have seen anyway. You have skills, you have progression.
But it is all wapped up in a system that is so mind numbling boring and fiddly.

Sold. Not looking back.

I’ve got about 16 hours total played so far across 4 sessions with two different groups. This game is absolutely amazing as a story telling game. If you are considering backing the 2nd edition, and you are not a fan of painting your own mini’s, then you won’t be missing too much playing with the standees only. The mini’s are really only relevant for maybe 40% of the total game, if that. Everyone I have played with, some of which have never played an RPG, and are openly not fans of RPGs, have loved this game. 

Yes, there are some issues with lack of proofreading, and yes sometimes you do have to hunt pretty hard to get specific answer to niche questions (easily solved by using the PDF rulebook and just searching keywords). I’m not really sure where the description of “fiddly” on a lot of review/comments is coming from. My group barely glanced at the rule book before diving right into the first story. Once you understand skill checks, chance to hit, and damage rolls, you’re pretty much covered. The story book does the rest. 

The combat is barely tactical, and really serves mostly as a light break from the more in depth story based gaming. If you are looking for deep, strategic combat, then this is not your game. 

I would encourage people considering this game to not be discouraged by the negative comments. Many people saying they dislike the game are also saying in the very same comment that they are losing interest in this genre! Well, that hardly seems objective to me. My wife and I, along with our two groups of light gamers, are absolutely loving Folklore.

RATING: 3
Part of me feels bad about rating a game this low.  And maybe after just 1 play I shouldn't, but I'm done.  I'm done playing these lame fantasy games, that have great minis, mediocre stories, and really lame mechanics.  I need to feel like the actions I'm taking during the game make a difference.  Moving to get in range of a target, and then rolling dice over and over and over again attacking it is mind numbingly boring.

I really should go back and rate a handful of other games in this same genre as low as this game.  I was too generous with the ratings I gave them.  If this game only took 1 hour to play, I could give it a higher rating.  But not at 2+ hours.

I'm sure I'm missing something that others see.  But not all games are for all people, and at this point I don't care to explore this rabbit hole any further.

Fantastic rpg in a form of a board game with deep story element and character development. Rules overhead is quite small for the depth the game provides, this also means that not everything is written out so well and causes ambiguities from time to time and some things have to be decided without being 100% sure how it is supposed to work - since it´s an rpg it actually works, there is still loads more structure to the game than a traditional rpg would have where the DM would decide and make up rules as they please all the time. 
It´s definitely one of the best adventure/rpg board games I have played. If not for the rules problems I would rate it 9 instead of 8.

This game is simply amazing. Yes, it has flaws like 2 character balance being whack but the general feel and theme of the game is so great. The gameplay flows along nicely too. It really feels a DMless RPG. If you don't like rolling dice then stay away from this game.

This game looks fun. I have had a hard time getting into HeroQuest, so I worry a bit about this game. But it is gorgeous (at least with the minis expansion), it's got a wonderful theme, and it would let my wife and I play D&Dish games with no GM, which is definitely appealing.

This is truly the RPG experience wrapped up in a box. The story is intriguing, the choices feel meaningful, and the tactical combat is intense.

Very few full co-op games manage to create a strong narrative without a player taking the role of a GM, but Folklore is one of the few that does. The fiction and world building around the game is an outstanding blend of dark fantasy and European folklore. Individual adventures are more than just simple dungeon crawls; they are complete stories with branching pathways, both combat and non-combat encounters, side-quests, and random events. There are even story hooks for each of the individual characters that become known over the course of the campaign. 

Enemy actions in battle are governed by a few, easy to follow rules which keep the game moving quickly. Combat is tense and exciting though. All enemies have a variety attacks that can weaken and hamper the players, and exploiting the patterns of enemy movement is usually necessary if the players want to survive. There are plenty of double edged swords to fall on too. Some afflictions (such as lycanthropy) or cursed artifacts can provide great advantages, but can carry terrible risks not only for the bearer, but their companions as well. 

Art and minis are all top-notch, and fit perfectly with the game's theme. Each of the six player characters in the base game are well designed, and not all just re-skins of the typical fantasy fighter/priest/wizard/thief quartet (the hook-wielding madman that can throw the severed limbs of his foes as a ranged attack is my personal favorite) Each character selects from a variety of skills and stat raises over the course of their development. There are a multiple variations of viable character builds that can be tailored to player taste, or chosen to take maximal advantage specific to some of the gear the player has found over the course of the campaign. 

Overall, this is an easy game to recommend for people that  want a strong, narrative focused cooperative game. There is enough variability and randomness in each story to make replays entertaining, but not so much that it leaves the campaign feeling like a grimdark exquisite corpse.

I picked this game up at GenCon 50. At this point, I and a friend have played into the third story (so about half-way through the core six stories). I enjoy the game, and it has gotten better as I continue to remember some of the nuances of the rules (like remembering to make a d10 search role for items following a skirmish).

The Pros:  The game world is interesting and atmospheric, with well written flavor text. The choices it requires, be they for the specific story or for an event card during play, are interesting and can have pretty strong positive and negative effects on your play through. The general board play is fairly balanced while travelling the world map and handling random encounters, and the skirmishes are enjoyable and yet still challenging.

The ability to "die" and become a ghost seemed like failure the first time it happened. However, once you understand the function of the dynamic, it is has lead to some harrowing encounters, especially with the main boss afflictions, where you are able to snatch victory out of the jaws of the werewolf or giant tree or whatever your choice of creature may be.

The item cards available for use by your chosen hero are varied and, for the most part, assist during the various stories in the game. The use of rituals and prayers as "spells" works well, and some of them are truly helpful if you can make the appropriate roll to get them to function.

All of this is wrapped in a well-polished package, with excellent artwork, varied miniatures (especially the individual characters), nice cardboard punch-out parts and includes individual, zipped baggies for storing tokens and cards, etc. (listen up Fantasy Flights!).

The Cons:  The zoomed in adventures/encounters using the square-grid maps offer little strategy such as would be present in a full-fledged RPG, miniature encounter in a game like Pathfinder. The movement distance on these small maps is much too long, and your characters are basically surrounded for most, if not all, of the encounters or end up chasing around range characters for no reason (creatures and player characters can reach each other in one movement anyway). This lack of strategy is especially true in the narrow caves, where, if the affliction out rolls you on first strike (initiative), you are trapped in a two square area with no where to move for the remainder of the encounter, simply putting your life to chance with d00 rolls. There are also some unbalanced effects and ill-explained rules and cards that interfere with play at time (need some future rule explanation/FAQs in the 
near future), and the vita/ghost point tracking cards can get a bit wonky if someone sneezes.

The Gist:  I recommend this game for anyone looking for a board game that adds the depth of character improvement present in an rpg campaign. Folklore:  The Affliction fulfills its presumed goal of translating an rpg experience to a board game. I am looking forward to further expansions and the adventure creation kit that will allow for some fan created adventures to expand on the replayability of the game.

As A DM I love this game! The story is awesome and I could go on but all I have to say is this...THIS GAME IS GREAT! The story and art are amazing and I cant stop thinking about it.

First with the good.  This game has awesome components, art and story telling.  Traveling the map is a stroke of genius and is a new, fresh gameplay element that I much enjoy.  The off-road and on-road events are fun to draw.  The maps are depicted with beautiful art and combat can be a fun, rewarding experience- they definitely mix it up (combat encounters are rarely the same).  

The story book is a very fun part of the game.  It is quite enriching to play through and adds a key role playing experience to the game.  It’s one of my favorite parts of Folklore.  It also offers a surprisingly amount of replay value.  You can play through the stories and make different decisions with different outcomes.

The Average.  Some of the rules are missing clarification.  This isn’t to say that the rule book is bad, it’s actually above average, but some key elements are missing.  How often can you travel between the story events?  Can you freely move around and hit town after town as much as you like?  If so, then why are there clearly marked moments that say ‘use town services’?  There are a lot of rules that need to be spelled out. 

The swingy-ness.  A critical outcome in the game can come down to a much needed high role. Fail and you are hosed.  Also, very arbitrary outcomes.  I got this stupid ring that made a werewolf leader rage against me (unless I cut my finger off, suffer damage but still enrage the werewolf leader- why??).  Then, you can never remove it and suffer a grievous permanent treasure loss from slain monsters.  I don’t know why this ring element is even added- it makes your life harder and you have no choice.  This was done by an arbitrary, little search early on the game. 


The bad.  Two player solo rules do not work in their current form.  You quickly get thrashed and overwhelmed.  Playing with four solo players makes it more balanced but then becomes too easy.  I completed the first six stories and never once became a ghost.  Plus, the micromanaging of resources with four characters can be a slog.  But it does beat playing with two- where you can’t get past scenarios because you keep on dying.  And dying- losing half your gold and one equipment is too steep of a price to pay- especially with two characters.

The rumor deck- blows the balance out of the water.  It makes the game too easy as you acquire lore and gold in huge amounts in addition to whatever rewards you get from the monsters you slay.  This often is by completing a single map of combat. They need to play test and refine the rumor deck.  It’s an awesome element but provides too much reward for too little risk.

I’m giving this game a six out of ten.  It’s above average.  The components are beautiful and the game play can be a lot of fun, even though it is hamstrung by untested rules and gameplay.  More, much more, play testing needs to be done.  The rulebook needs key refinement.  Once these things are addressed the game is easily an 8 out of 10.  

I’ve played a total of ten stories so far.  Six with four characters and four with two characters.  I was forced to drop the campaign with two characters because I literally got to a point where I couldn’t get past a specific combat encounter and I was forced to go through it (not including losing half my gold and one random item!). I’m taking a break from this game and seeing what they fixes that they make.  I will come back to it in a half year and hopefully I’ll be in a fresh state of mind.

I recommend getting this game but please understand it’s still unfinished as far as play testing and rules go.

Cannot wait for this to arrive, but I'll have to! Closest board game (perhaps equal to Mage Knight in some ways) to a true RPG yet without the essential RPG element of GM.

Another fantasy dungeon crawl that thinks it can survive on theme. I am sick of these kinda games. This does nothing new in an already bloated category. 

Look at Gloomhaven. Be innovative if you wanna make a fantasy dungeon crawl

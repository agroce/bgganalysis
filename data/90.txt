GAME: Star Wars: Episode 1 â€“ Clash of the Lightsabers

RATING: 6
For the price (usually found under $5) it is well worth it. A quick two player game with some nice tactical choices. And cute pewter pieces. Try the variant with a fixed 8 card hand limit. Plays even better.

RATING: 6.5
Surprise! A terribly poor film begats a pretty decent and worthwhile 2-player game. The action is defined and the milieu is made more real with the 2 pewter combatant pieces that only add to the playing atmosphere.
Still, this is a good filler game that always ends up being close.

RATING: 5
good value for the $3 or whatever it commands.  i like it better than en garde and such.  with repeat plays the hand/deck management could really take off, but i couldn't really see myself playing this enough to get to that point.  for a quick but real 2-player duel, i'd rather play lightning: d-day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is much better than it's mediocre rating would suggest.  It is easy to learn, dramatic to play, and difficult to master.  There are some rules questions, but they could all be answered with a simple yes or no, and otherwise, this game plays pretty tightly.  Don't let the ratings scare you away.  This is an excellent game with good drama, and can currently be purchased very cheaply on eBay or similar sites.

RATING: 6
What is interesting is that Epic Duels always gets mentioned as a decent mainstream Star Wars game (including being pretty desired on the secondary market), but you never hear about this game, which at its core essentially a simplified version with some similar mechanics. As a very light quick game, it scratches the same itch. 

As an aside, I just realized that it was designed by Craig Van Ness, who also designed Heroscape, SW: Queen's Gambit, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Sorry Sliders, Battleship Galaxies, and a number of other solid mass market games.

RATING: 6
This is a fun little game, although for some odd reason my games are never close despite that the two decks are identical to one another.  Someone always seems to manage to blow out the other player.  Odd.

If someone can manage to draw all the "draw another card" cards to their hand, there isn't much you can do to beat them.  That's kind of lame when it happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Good game (7.5). It gets a bonus point (+1.0) for having solid-flow in a small package. 

Plays quickly as numerous little fights in the midst of a larger battle.  Will have to try it with the kids.




=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Take the role of Qui-Gon or Darth Maul in the exciting duel.  The planning and strategy is deep.  There is some luck, as always, in the card draw but this doesn't bother me at all.  I like how some of the cards compound on each other and allow you to strategically play multiple cards in one round.  The special ability cards are very well balanced.

RATING: 8
Nice little card game, I prefer it to other 2 player card games (like Lost Cities) but unfortunately the theme doesn't seem to appeal to others - and the actual game is more hand management than 'dueling' so it doesn't get played :( I'm waiting for my son to be old enough to play ... *** update, tried it with my son (who's 6), massive hit, he loves it and grasped the hand management concepts pretty quickly - and is now a challenging opponent :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've only played this a few times with my kids so I'm not sure about it yet.  However, the small# of cards mean in your hand at any time meansthere is a significant amount of luck, I think probably too much.  With that said, figuring out how to play your special cards, when to concede and when to push are all tactical decisions.  If I had to guess, I'd say the better player would win 70% of the time give or take 5%.  

On the plus side, once you know what you're doing, you can play a game in about 15 minutes.  Which means a run of bad luck doesn't hurt too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is better than you think it will be. Fast, fun and exciting - it's one of those quick 2-player games that leaves you wanting a rematch immediately after you finish. Plus, you get those Exclusive Collectible Pewter Figurines! Score!

For a light little movie tie-in game, we sure do end up playing it a whole bunch.  Fun two-player, indirect and direct conflict game.  Honestly, it's right up there with Shazaam! and Times Square among my favorite duel-type games.

Decent wee game.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Saying I like it better than Lost Cities might be a bit of a stretch now; as I've gained appreciation for Lost Cities, Clash hasn't kept up. That's OK, this is still a cool game. But not as good as Lost Cities.
---
Not bad! In fact, I find it better than competing euro-style products such as Schotten-Totten, Lost Cities, etc. - more tension, more strategy. Interestingly, the flavor is good but not great (the action cards could be better), but still way better than the aforementioned Euro games. A very nice find.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not much fun.  A few of the cards take the fun out of it (there&#039;s a card that causes the other player to discard all played cards).  I only play it when my son requests it and cannot be encouraged in another direction.

I've had fun playing this with my 11 year old son.  It's short so he doesn't get bored and has enough strategy to interest me.  Feels like a lighter version of the Blue Moon card game.  Do you save cards to win later, or spend cards to win now?  Some good bluffing/guessing as well.  Wish it had more decks of different characters to spice it up.  I think it would expand nicely.  Worth having.  I'm sure my son would rate it a '9'.

Ebay. 99 cents. 

Use alternative Chaos Battleline play. More streamlined, more strategic, more fun. 

Rated just slightly lower than Battleline. Game play 7 - Pewter minis +1 WOW!

According to  Avalon Hill/Hasbro: "...the first batch of games went out with a typo on the FINAL ATTACK cards. The correct type should read 'Discard your entire hand.' You do not get to draw new cards when you play it." Also, be aware that FINAL ATTACK has an Attack Value of 6. 

The typo was fixed in the Transformers and Iron Man reissues.

What is this?!? War with a pasted on theme? Slightly more challenging, I suppose, and perhaps entertaining for ten year olds, but not any older than that. Cool metal figurines that are unfortunately wasted on a mediocre card game. It could be so much more in concept, but then Hasbro wouldn't be able to market it.

A two-player tug-of-war game. It plays a bit like Battle Line or Lost Cities, but has its own uniqueness and an elegance of its own. Its a little lighter than I would have liked so I'll probably only use it as a filler. Also, the wordings on the cards could've been written a whole lot better.

It doesn't have that instant 'lets play again' feel, but its themed superbly, lots of fun ('choose wisely' and 'I use the force' quotes thrown around liberally in deep intonations), usually well balanced, with good bluff and counterbluff opportunities. Having hands to make best use of the action cards, and in particular the Retreat card, will usually be decisive, as well as picking the right times to concede a battle so as to protect / support a better chance in the next battle. Being attractive and playable with the kids (8 and up) gives it more play than it would get with just gamers.

This is a great game about the battle of Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul who can be helped out by Obi-Wan and the future emperor.  The cardplay is somewhat reminiscent of Condottierre.

Back in the days when I was young enough to enjoy Episode 1, I got this game and played it a number of times with my Mother, who actually enjoyed the play counter counter gameplay about as much as one could. The game was fairly slick and sleek, and a good simple game for two people to burn ten minutes or an hour playing. I wouldn't mind a game like this (with maybe some form of expansions or add ons) with a new nonStarWars theme.

RATING: 7
Fast and simple game for two players a bit too much lucky driven in my opinion. Some little strategies are present, but often the game is heavily influenced by the order (and quality) of draws. Not so bad, however.

A very clever game of war.  The theme is a bit pasted on...there really is no use for the figures other than eye candy.  Also I was disappointed that the specials are exactly the same for both sides (barring their titles and images of course).  Still, there is some strategy invovled, and it is extremely important that you manage your hand well...having more cards than your opponent is a HUGE advantage (and there are some tricky combos that allow this.)  The game goes by quickly, lasting maybe 15 min, which can be a plus (but at the same time leaves you wanting more.)

Great simple yet strategic thematic card game. Forget the other games' yet-another-card-game-that's-just-adding/dividing/comparing-numbers-exercise : [i]this[/i] card game delivers combat, psychology and theme that leaves actual MEMORABLE gaming sessions.

Found an extra copy at GW for $1.99

Great light game.  When both players are familiar with it, you can finish in about 10 minutes.  My only real complaint is that if you get one really bad hand, you can be sunk. Several times we&#039;ve seen a player not only lose all three rounds with a horrible hand, but his opponent is still holding a couple cards, so he is still at a disadvantage in future rounds.  Doesn&#039;t seem to happen too often, though; just sucks when it&#039;s you.

This game was a lot better than i thought.  nice little war game.  Has a bit of a feel like blue moon but a bit easier.  the pewter figures are really unnecessary but are beautiful especially for there age.  The decks are asymmetrical and I' not sure they are balanced but the game is still fun for a light short filler duel.

We have one house rule: the Retreat card only lets you pick up number cards, not action cards. Otherwise it's too powerful.

Great little card game. Need to agree on how two "2x" cards will work before you start. Will it become "2x", "3x" or "4x"? Makes for an arguement in the middle of the game if it comes up.

Quick, fast, challenging, and tense.  It's not a perfect game, but there's room for strategy, and it plays quickly enough that you feel like you're having a duel with lightsabers.  And you know I know EXACTLY how that feels.

I shudder anytime I see a themed game (strongly or otherwise) that is perfectly symmetrical. CotL (and Caesar & Cleopatra, which is eerily similar) suffers from this. To me, playing Darth Maul should feel quite different from playing Qui-Gon Jinn. Maul should've had more combat cards, fewer specials (relentless attack) with Qui-Gon as written. At the end of the day, a very good mass-market product that pales in comparison to its niche competitors.

The game focuses on the duel between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul. Players face off in three battles per round trying to beat the other in two out of the three battles. If you win a round then you score a point on the victory track. Players have to manage a hand of cards and decide when to press forward and when to concede a battle.

Be sure to play with the errataed versions of the "Final Attack" cards (cards are discarded, but not re-drawn). Also, we play that Retreat cards only allow players to pick up number cards.

My personal favorite Star Wars game, just ahead of Queen's Gambit and Epic Duels. You wouldn't think a sabre duel could be duplicated in card form, but the game is quick, strategic, and actually very thrilling to play. Unbeliveable comebacks are possible (I should know).

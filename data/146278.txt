Un grandisimo juego para dos, la unica pega es que la curva de aprendizaje se alza mucho, por lo que un jugador que lleve varias decenas de partidas es fácil que gane a cualquiera que no lleve más de 10.

This game is so good! Every time I play it I feel like I get a slightly deeper and richer experience than the time before. 

It's more "tactical" than "strategic", the board state can change so much between turns that there isn't a huge amount to be gained from planning ahead, which makes it less chess-like, which for me is a definite plus.

Have played multiplayer death match and 2P high form so far. Death match was fun, but the high form is when its at its best. I love how you have to balance the need to keep your opponent in check with the need to complete objectives and gain victory points.

Grandísimo juego para 2 jugadores, abstracto pero con temática pegada curiosa. Tratas de realizar formas con piezas en un tablero a cuadrados, para invocar otras piezas y eliminar las del contrario. Diversos modos de juego, cartas de objetivos a cumplir con puntuaciones, etc. 4 facciones de cartas, 2 de ellas iguales. Materiales muy justitos pero correctos. Un gran juego para 2. Se podrían hacer torneos de este juego perfectamente.

I really dig this game so far, though I've only played a couple of games with the full rules.  It has a very much Vlaada feel to it, which I love, but has much less overhead than many of his other games.  I feel like I can get this one explained to people quickly.

I'd really like to play more, and see how my feelings change over time.

Thematic, abstract, competitive game where you try to create pattern before your opponent gets in your way.
I like the art work. The pattern matching, however, is not for everybody (some people find it very difficult to spot or even create patterns).

And now for your gaming pleasure, Vlaada with an abstract!

The whole game is an abstract in fantasy clothing.  Which is fine.  Except it plays like an abstract, feels like an abstract, and burns brains like an abstract.  Which works if you want to play a long abstract, but that's not my cup o' tea.

Too long, too slow, too brain-numbing for me.  And I don't usually mind brain-numbing, but this one is not doing it for me.  You can make whatever plans you want -- they're probably D.O.A. by the time it gets back to your turn.  And why do I suspect that part of the challenge will be recognizing when your hand is crap and you should pitch it?  That's not a skill I feel I need to develop.

Nope, an excellent abstract but very much not for me.  I've rated it as highly as I have (6) because it's a really solid, well done game.  (Really!)  If I liked abstracts, I'd be all over this like a teenager at a Justin Bieber concert (sorry, that's the analogy I'm going with), but I don't like most abstracts and this one just isn't my bag.  Ah well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is so much here I should hate: highly abstract game play that seems to reward incredibly slow analysis. But days after playing two quick games, I couldn't get it out of my mind. I should have had more faith in Chvatil. The secret information, rotating goals, and sheer complexity means that playing from the hip works reasonably well. The result has some entertaining chaos, surprising turnabouts, but still feels like skill plays a large part of it.

RATING: 5.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

While this is definitively an unique title, Tash-Kalar didn't resonate with me very much.

The game-play is very deep and back-and-forth, as you try to manipulate the board to your advantage and play cards with special abilities. I can also see how this is probably a game that gets better with multiple plays. Yet I feel a big thematic disconnect between the game's theme and mechanisms... somehow Tash-Kalar gave me the same vibes of a Feld title for the theme integration.

Furthermore, as it usually happens with CGE games, I really don't like the artwork and graphic presentation. While it has its unique style, it just doesn't work for me.

I'll surely give the game another try, when I'll get the chance... but so far I don't think that this is a title for me. Too mechanical and yet not enough interesting to fascinate me with the choices that it offers.

This Game plays VERY well. The mechanics work very well. Next plays a try the high form mode.

Update: my copy with both expansions 

Update: a few days ago i finally play with both expansions and in the high form mode. This game is a masterpiece in abstract games. The Nether faction plays so different, but causes a lot of damage in the enemy forces. The "cold guys" plays very weel too, but my favorites still the barbarians. They plays fast, strike hard and have great unitys.

1st play attempt: We initially set up the game once and aborted three moves into the game. The wife was not feeling it.

2nd play: We took another go at it, committing to 3 games, and we both really enjoyed it. What was the difference? We stopped trying to play long term strategically and started playing tactically. The game evokes a feeling of being dueling Mages presiding over magic statues in an arena. Pieces come alive, do their thing, and then return to lifeless stone. 

My favorite part is that, like other Vlaada games, it feels like you're losing and there is no hope - and then you just barely pull off a move and suddenly there's hope.

I don't know how long I'll want to keep playing it, but right now I really enjoyed my plays and look forward to playing again.

Update: played this with 3, and it was still fun. We haven't even touched the legends deck and the game flows well with a good scoring system and simple rules to explain. Well done Vlaada! (The price is still too high tho, Boo Z-man)

RATING: 7.5
Really different design expected from Vlaada who always put the themes of his games in a very beautiful synchromism with the mechanics. This time we are facing a game that is almost abstract, very far away from having a convincing theme. It is a game of making patterns and the patterns are based on objects and creatures and this is the near tematic as it gets.

It is a good design, though, easy rules and easy to explain and there is a lot going on to face. I played two of the modes: High Form and Deathmatch Duel, liked both ways, but I intend to play this game only in two players, I think it will get so much chaotic in more players, specialy the deathmatch melee. Ok maybe I'll try the team mode to see it working one day.

Just saying that I liked the game despite the absense of theme, it tries to make patterns that makes you think of the shapes of creatures and it's ok.

Way too abstract for my tastes. I really liked the artwork but when the game starts it all goes away and you are left with a chess like board. I also think that for an abstract game, Tash-Kalar has too much randomness (in the card drawing part of the game) and too much chaos if you are playing with 3 or 4 players. Maybe with repeated plays things will be more controllable.

A random chaotic mess--unless you know the all the decks by heart.  But way too light of a game to go through all the tedious trouble of memorizing the decks.  Also, once you learn the decks and become skilled, no one will want to play with you any more.  It's a good idea, but it ends up being slightly less fun than geometry homework.

Really intriguing design here, think of it like an abstract meets Magic the Gathering. You places pieces in various formations on the arena board and these formations can 'summon' creatures from your hand, and you can also eliminate other pieces of equal or weaker strength. Several modes to play, including Deathmatch, Deathmatch Melee, and the High Form in which you score by resolving various Task conditions. Four decks included.

I've owned this game for a couple of weeks now, and played it over ten times. We have a Tash-Kalar 'community' brewing at work, and people love it.
There aren't many games so versatile; it features two game modes: Deathmatch for 2, 3, 4, or two 2-player teams; and High-Form for 2 or two 2-player teams. Though I prefer High-Form, Deathmatch is very satisfying, and only gets better with more experienced players.

My only complaint with the game is its production. $65 (Z-Man Edition) gets you 120 cards, 80 thin punched tokens, four player score boards (also thin punch), and a board (double-sided; same material as punch board). For a fairly minimalist, abstract game that feels like Othello on acid, I'd like my pieces to have some weight.
The unexpected benefit of this problem, however, is that I have been inspired to experiment with polymer clay and cast resin, in the search for the perfect, custom pieces. No other game has quite captured my creative attention and inspiration like this before.

I am not in love with abstract games, and I was definitely underwhelmed when I read the rules of this game. Because, hey, it's the new game designed by Vlaada, so it should have been special.
Then I tried it at CGE demo booth in Essen.
It was pleasant to play.

There are two modes of play: high form (about scoring goals) and melee (about destroying opposing pieces).
Players alternate in taking two actions, each action can be placing a basic piece in an empty square, or summon a being and resolving its effect. To summon beings, players must form patterns of pieces and play cards.

Tash-Kalar has easy rules, plays fast and is challenging, tactical and engaging.

As with most Chvatil games, there are layers of interesting mechanics, but always one or two layers too far. The core gameplay is too abstract to please the Euro crowd, and the extra layers are too baroque to please abstract gamers. That seems like it would fit my sweet spot, but I found the planning to be overwhelming. Would necessitate a decent time investment in the game to get to the point where I could feel comfortable with all of the mechanics and formulate long-term strategies.

You cannot do any planning as the board drastically changes on each player's turn. This leads to huge amounts of AP.

Interesting thing, but I am not sure how much I like the concept. Basically you try to chain together a succession of constellations on the board. It is not like many other abstract games, in which you try to find and prevent the other players strategy.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
I had fun... and I am looking forward to playing again, however there were a couple of concerns with this one.  1) Need more decks.  With only 3 choices, this doesn't seem like there is a ton of variety (especially for the $43 discounted price point).  2) It's pretty abstract, and I am worried that I would rather just play other 2 player games.  At this point though, like I said previously, I do want to play more, and see where this one ends up, but I have a feeling it may trend down.

Imagine chess right, but it's fun and thematic!  
This game offers so much in the way of player interaction and strategic focus.  

So easy to get caught up trying to eliminate your opponents pieces, you can lose focus on the win conditions.  Trying to get the patterns to come together and maximise the effects of the cards, while trying to defeat the opponent WHILE ALSO trying to react to your opponents actions!!!

This game is just nuts, addictive and fun through and through!

Yes it's an abstract, but like Chess there is a theme of sorts that fits the mechanics and I much prefer that to a dry euro with a pasted on theme.

A bit on the long side; not sure how much it will speed up with more plays as that may just mean more scope for doublethink and AP.

Definitely not my cup of tea. I found that there is so much change from one turn to another that you cannot really formulate any kind of strategy. The artwork is really gorgeous and I liked the different decks but it just ended too abstract and chaotic for my taste.

I enjoyed the idea of this game more than I enjoyed the game itself.

I like trying to form patterns in order to play my cards with an eye towards board control and obtaining score cards. It's a good idea.

Unfortunately, the variety of cards and the difficulty of forming patterns leads to a lot of thinking. Only on my turn. And I'm not a huge fan of downtime, nor am I a big fan of making people wait.

This is, obviously then, a very turn to turn game. A long term plan that you might not be able to follow through on at all because of how much the board can change, would be a three turn plan (two turn plans are often disrupted, but they do at least some times happen).

I also can't imagine playing this with more than two players. It must be brutally slow.

I don’t care what some people say – Tash-Kalar is an extremely abstract game! I’m certainly not a sucker for theme or nice components, but boy did it feel abstract to place your small discs in a so that you could summon a unit in order to complete a task… Seriously, the theme is paper-thin, and I honestly think Chess has more theme. Oh well, as said, I don’t really care, but I just wanted to state my opinion on this matter as it has been discussed a lot. Onto the game itself:
Now, I’ve only tried it with 2 player, and while I wouldn’t mind trying it once with 4, I definitely think it’s better (and should probably only be played like this?) with 2, just like Summoner Wars etc.

In the game you’re placing discs to form patterns which match your cards; you do it to destroy the other player’s pieces and in order to complete tasks if playing this version of the game (which I would recommend). It’s very, very easy to thwart your opponent’s plan – even without realizing it, but simply by sheer luck (as you didn’t know which pattern your opponent was trying to form)! I definitely don’t like this as it means that you cannot make longterm plans but have to resort to shortterm plans and tactical moves instead of following a big overall strategic arch. Also it just sucks to have your plans destroyed by a lucky shot from your opponent… Oh, and I’d also like to say that the fact that the pattern on the cards can be rotated, flipped or even be a mirror image makes the game bog down as you need to visualize every option!

It’s cool that the game can end in various ways, but I have to say that the number of cards you get to play can vary a LOT! One of my plays ended when my opponent’s deck was empty while I still had 9 cards left simply because I couldn’t summon as much as him during the game… That’s pretty crazy. And this again shows how rather random it can be whether you get to summon units or not; you can set yourself up, but your opponent might ruin your plans without even knowing. Is this a sign of a good game? No. Still, the advanced version of the game (which I would definitely recommend although it’s slightly more complicated), the one where you compete for some shared goal cards and score points, seems to be pretty even. Part of it is probably because of the flare cards which help you catch up.

On the other hand, the 2p death match is awful! As soon as one player gets a small advantage, he will continue to be in the lead. At least that’s my experience and as far as I understand here on BGG that’s the same experience some of you have too. Maybe my buddy and I are just bad at this game and let this happen, but we really can’t see how the game should be close most times when playing the death match version of the game… It’s like a snowballing effect in which the rich player gets richer and spawns more units and controls the board whereas the other player uses his two actions to deploy units without being able to actually summon the creatures… However, to be “fair”, the losing player might still get lucky and be able to summon a guy because the winning player has no idea how the other player’s cards are shaped, so it’s pretty hard to block…

Played the basic version with two players. 

In one game I lost 0-6, and in the second won 6-0, which means my initial thought is the game may have some balance issues (as you can be unlucky with the intial card draws). 

I expect that to enjoy this one you really need to fully appreciate what cards are in the deck and to build some experience playing. So it is not a casual game.

Wow. Very late to the party on this one (been sitting unloved of the shelf for a few years), but very much enjoyed this. About 5-6 games in, and really digging it. Strictly using the "High Form" mode of the game. Perhaps my favorite fantasy 2-player. [b]Way[/b] more enjoyable than something like Mage Wars (or whatever they call it now). Setup is super simple without spending eons deck crafting before starting the game. Although all the cards do have text on them (normally I am not inclined toward such games), the text uses highly consistent language around a small set of concepts. I like games that allows players to have interesting moves, and this has that in spades. But it's highly chaotic and tactical, so not for everyone. But it's a battle after all. Pound the other guy more than he pounds you. 2v2 team mode was also quite fun.

This game is certainly interesting, but I wouldn't call it fun. I also think that there are some balancing issues with the objectives, I think that the side chain and corner chain are far too difficult to achieve without overcommitting to the board and letting your opponent walk all over you with flares. When you compare them to say Red Legend it seems ridiculous.

Played just once - some fun, but felt too long / involved for a light game, too random for a thinky game, and too abstract for an experience game.

I've heard that Tash-Kalar is intended to be played in half an hour, in sort of an instinctive style. I can certainly imagine that it would be better that way, but I feel like the game itself doesn't do enough to push you towards that style of play - that sort of pattern-making. Having only 3 cards from your deck does help, but only goes so far, particularly because many people take a bit to figure out the possible rotations and reflections. Perhaps if there were, say, a hard time limit on turns (15 seconds? Or 30 seconds when learning?), that'd do it - but again, some folks have trouble seeing the rotations and reflections that quickly, so it might drive off many players.

(I also feel like the game might work great once you'd played a whole lot and had an instinctive sense for the patterns players might be forming, but it's the journey there...)

Posiblemente, el juego que he probado de Vlaada que menos me ha gustado... y es una pena, realmente tenia muchas ganas de que me gustara. Abstracto, el que más de este autor, aunque intenta darle tema con las formas que recuerdan levemente a lo que quieres invocar. No está mal del todo, pero tiene una curva bastante elevada, hasta que no te conoces todas las cartas no le empiezas a coger el gusto. Y eso si, solo lo jugaria a 2, a mas se vuelve muy caótico e impredecible.

This game just didn't click with us.  I liked the idea of it, of the different powers combined with the abstract game and the varied goals, but I just had no idea what I was doing.  Sure, I know how to build the patterns, but which ones?  And why?  And when?  And how do I start?  It didn't help that we were completely unfamiliar with the decks.

Yes, I realize that more experience and a thorough knowledge of both decks would make it easier to see what we ought to be doing, but there just wasn't enough interest or fun to want to keep going past the three plays we did put in.

Simple rules, dynamic and aggressive gameplay. Relatively quick playing time.
Possibilities for situation reversal for the trailing players, with the ruse cards.
Different play modes, goal oriented or kills oriented, both leading to different flow of the game.
the base game includes both symmetrical factions or asymmetrical ones.

Very positive first impressions, lots of possibilities in a small package. Looks abstract but the character cards are thematically implemented. For example you really feel the difference when a cannon or a knight is activated. 

Components are ok and serviceable, but not very attractive. Standard cardboard quality, the cards are a bit thin, but you don't manipulates that much. The game would have really benefited for wooden checkers sized counters instead of the cardboard ones.

hm, so what's this?... Not really cluttered design as such, but this doesn't really go together too well, does it? Don't get me wrong, I like puzzling. I like gaming, too. This one tries to do both an somehow fails. Talking about downtime, this is bad (especially considering the fact that this basically from its whole makeup and *actual* depth of play is no more than a filler -- well, let me explain the last bit: there's really no strategic planning in advance, I guess, since the board situation is not under your control, so what depth there is is purely tactical). The catch-up mechanism is worked in in such a very non-elegant way. Na. Spend your time with better games than this one.

This is a strategy game. It is quite good and the strategy involved is huge. It is the closest games that I have two chess but it is much better and does have some somatic Elements. The one complaint I had about it was the rulebook. Once again Vlad has tried to make the writing as rich as possible. What this does though is make it very difficult to get the basic information for the game. He repeats himself a great deal and I find that I get confused. It is also very difficult to find references. There are different sections with the same information. But it is not easy to find that information evening with the basic rule Catalog that comes on A single piece of paper. Stefan fouled games are typically much better written allowing the reader to quickly reference information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Players are mages, casting magically infused stones into patterns on a game board, which briefly summon some sort of spirit being.

A baffling, stunning design.  Players take turns taking two actions - either place a checkers like piece onto a gridded board, or summon a creature from a mini-hand of cards.  Creatures are summoned if the pieces on the board geometically match the patterns on the cards in the player's hand.  Once summoned, the creature impacts the game with some effect, then vanishes, leaving a stone or two on the board - possibly influencing further patterns.

The object of the game is to accomplish crowd pleasing tasks, which involve seeding the board in various ways, or removing opponents pieces, and so on.  These tasks award points, which are used to decide the victor.

Bit hard to peg this one down.  First off, it's brilliant.  The game takes about a minute to teach.  Turns are fast and punchy.  Early games are brain burning as you mentally place pieces, and flip images in your head, trying to morph the board to match your cards.  But after a game or two, you're flying, and into the blissful mind games where you are playing your opponent and not the game.  It reminded me strongly of the sublime Blue Moon, or Yomi, where the game becomes a battle of wits.  

Instant classic.

An abstract game about placing pieces into formations which enables you to play more powerful pieces from cards in hand.  Has different decks and different modes of play to keep it interesting.   Purely a tactical game, and a fun one at that.  I was pleasantly surprised.   Negatives include the unfortunate title and the price.

(My copy has since been upgraded with the upgrade kit, and that makes a big difference visually, and effectively lets you run two simultaneous games if you wanted to.)

 Good idea with some big drawbacks imho
 1.- The card size is a big, big mistake. Moreover if, as it appears, there are expansions planned. 
 2.- I see it as a two players game. Having implemented a 3-4 version... I don't make it out... 
 3.- In addition to the previous point, I would prefer just two sets of tokens with a better quality.

Regarding the game itself it is quite fun although perhaps too tactical since your oponent move's can be unpredictible despite the patterns you can detect he/she is trying to make.

I have to play it more for my final rating.

In overall I think it is a good game that could have been even better without those production issues.

Edit:

I didn't think I'd ever like an abstract strategy game as much as I like Tash-Kalar. After the first two plays, we had to go out and get both of the expansions. Another game where I have yet to win, but also have yet to care. You're constantly thinking and adapting to how your opponent just torpedoed your whole plan, you don't have time to worry about winning. You just want to get that awesome boulder beast, or dire wolf on the board and tear up your enemies' pieces!

I went on with my Vlaada quest, and I stumbled on this one.
Not everybody I played it with liked it, but I love it.
It's highly tactical but not strategic, since the table is gonna change so much and so quickly, that it is not possible to make long term plans, but only reacting to the current situation doing the best you can with what you have.

It's evocative, tight, and I like the summoning of various epic beasts that mess up the whole table xD

Somehow related to "Magic: the Gathering", but take this statement with a pinch of salt.

My rating may change with subsequent plays.  Tash-Kalar is an abstract fighting game.  It is a little complicated and likely requires players to be equally familiar with the decks being used.  It might be good for new players to review the rules on their own prior to game day and then examine the possible patterns in their deck to prepare.  Without doing so, there may be some AP.  With familiarity, I bet this game could get really fun.  There are quite a few expansions to throw into the mix, assuring replayability.

I was kind of down on the flare cards as they seemed like too much of a catch up mechanism at first, but they feel kind of necessary in order to balance out the randomness of deck draw.  Even then though, I feel like I'm justifying something that really doesn't need justification.  

The flare cards are a part of the game.  Period.  Arguing their existence is like arguing the existence of locomotive cards in Ticket to Ride.  The designer put them there, and they're part of the game.  Once I accepted that, I got a lot more into it.  

It's really fascinating to see the patterns unfold on the board, and figure out some clever pattern progression.  You can get an equal sense of foreboding from watching your opponent setting up a pattern that will dash all your plans, and there's nothing you have in your hand to stop it.  There's a lot of great drama in this game.  It's always a great time watching it unfold.

The gist of the game is playing cards with patterns on them, like an L, after you’ve put your pieces in that pattern. Then you get to execute the power. Since you can play the cards in mirror fashion, I had to flip the cards sometimes and imagine what it would look like. 

I put a beatdown on a friend but failed to score any points. In fact, I could’ve taken a 2 point card but chose to just keep beating him down. It was more fun than getting 6 guys in a row and taking a card.

I love, love, love:
- that the game offers two same-cards sets for learning the game
- the much-needed catch-up mechanism
- the multiple modes of play
- having to pay attention to the judges' wants, your own hand, and your opponent's schemes
- that it's not just a game of taking out all of your opponent's pieces--you have to battle them while also working toward getting the points on the goal cards
- the artwork, though the sylvan people are a bit too sexy
- that the game can be made more challenging and played in different modes
- that the game rewards repeat plays for its mastery
- that the patterns often look like or have effects fitting of their names
- that the game is well made with a thick main board and thick playing pieces

I dislike:
- the unusual card size; why not go for a more standard one like tarot size?

Final verdict: Still deciding. Need more plays!

Juego abstracto con tema de batalla de magos, en el que tendremos que jugar fichas en el tablero para formar patrones y así invocar nuestras criaturas, hay dos tipos de variante de juego, el legendarios en el que tendremos que conseguir objetivos que nos dará puntos y el a muerte en que tendremos que destruir la fichas del contrario.
Lo que destaca del juego es lo rápido que cambia todo y como tienes que ir adaptándote.

I enjoy the pattern-building and monster summoning quite a bit. They go a long way to give the classic abstact gameplay that drives the game some extra dimension. I like that the game is focused more on completing objectives rather than destroying all of your opponents pieces. However, there are rules for an alternate Deathmatch mode that does just that for those who want a more bloodthirsty game.

It's not you; it's me. 

It is a clever game. The theme doesn't do much for me, but that's not where the meat of the game is.

This game hurts my brain more than most abstracts. And not in a good way. It puts my lack of spatial intelligence in the spotlight, and I experienced some prtetty remarkable AP. This game brings out the absolute worst in me as a gamer.

RATING: 6.5
More of an abstract game that I was anticipating but I did rather enjoy this one. The red and blue decks are very evenly matched and make for an interesting game. The green deck is quite tweeky and is very interesting tactically. The yellow deck has raw power with a lot of its units destroying other units as they come in, however this is balanced by the flare deck, each player has a flare card which allows you extra moves or free units when you are outnumbered by your opponent. I like the objective card and the spread of tasks is really nice. Not yet played with the legendary units or the deathmatch mode but I do hope to get this to the table again soon

Sold in 2017.

It is what it is. A straight attacking game with card actions based on positional play. Pretty simple stuff. If you can get pieces on quickly in good spots, you can keep triggering your action cards and knock the other players around.

I am a huge Vlada Chavatil fan, and this is one of his most underrated games.  While Chavatil might seem a chameleon as a designer, his game all have a puzzlely feel in common.  Tash Kalar might very well be his most puzzlely game.  Fantastic two player.  Feels like chess at times; control the center, keep the initiative, keep your opponent on their heels.  Also a highly original take on a summoning game.  Fantastic game.  I hope that they keep creating additional armies for the game.

I'm sorry, but this is another very good game by Vlaada Chvatíl.

To me, it feels like a shorter and dynamic chess, but more fun.

A real brain-burner.

Til now I've played only three time: 2 death matches and one "high-form". High form is the best way to play the game, I think, because it needs planning both offensively and defensively.

Si esperas encontrarte con la sensación que vas a invocar un supermonstruo destruye todo que será tu amigo para toda la vida, no es tu juego, ese supermosntruo se va a transformar en piedrecita nada más salir y tu vas a colocar más piedrecitas. Pero si el tema te da igual y te molan los abstractos es un juegaco como la copa de un pino, eso sí, mejor jugar a matar a toñas, que los objetivos están bien para la primera partida pero es muy frustante cuando te falta siempre una mínima tontería para conseguir la carta.

I was expecting more. It's good...I guess? When it's your turn. Matching patterns is appealing to me so that part of the game is fun. Then you might as well walk away from the table and come back in 10 minutes. I fail to see how you can plan for anything until your turn comes back since a single piece removed will force you to rethink the entire play. So really, all you do is play your best combo right now. Which is not all that hard to figure out. Underwhelmed :(

RATING: 5
I have only played team deathmatch mode, and it's quite possible that this isn't the best way to play.

In this form, however, it was a highly chaotic game with few opportunities for strategic play or even turn-to-turn tactical plays. You either had a card or cards that matched the current situation on the board or you didn't which made for a pretty boring play.

Regardless of whether this is an accurate description of the game in the other modes as well, I am not fond of games that only start to make sense once you have internalized all the existing cards. Tash-Kalar undoubtedly is such a game. In order to meaningfully extrapolate what your opponent might be working towards and prepping your defence you need to know what cards and thus patterns exist. Until then you are merely fumbling around in the dark.

I've designed a gladiator arena boardgame, and before I sunk any more money into the art I thought I'd research other arena games to make sure my product would be unique.

Picked up Tash-Kalar and didn't know much about it. I have to say, I was pleasently surprised. The gameplay is like a thematic version of tetris/chess with the time crunch.
Loved matching the patterns and intense strategic gameplay.

The quality of the board, pieces, and art would nice to look at as well. It's completely different from my game, and does it's own thing unlike any other arena game I've seen/played.

The  designers should be proud, and you won't regret adding this to your collection!

The game is fun... untill you're taking turns wth your opponent making back and forth moves without any possibility to take a VP card.

Now, seriosly.
It is semi-abstract game and is heavily one.
The good thing is that it making patterns and summoning creatures is engaging! You really are focused on what you're doing.
I don't mind, feel and care the abstractness. Not at all.
The bad things are several:
- the fact that flares cards do exist clearly means that the game can easily run out of control! If not these cards one player could easily dominate the board;
- even without them is is still possible;
- there are moments of impasse - rather boring ones, that make the game feel longish.

Played one game and liked it, but I am not sure how many people around my table would enjoy it and how many could compete with me - I assume the learning curve is steep and long, so every play ahead gives you an advantage. If you play often against the same opponent(s) this might be a nice one to compete.

I used to rate this a 9.5 due to Z-Man's overpricing of the game (see original comment below). Now that it's available from CGE at an eminently more-reasonable price, I have adjusted my rating accordingly.

[Old Comment]
It pains me to ding a fabulous game due to publisher decisions, but the ratio of price to component quality on this game is terrible. The components are middle of the road quality (including cards that aren't a standard size, so they can't be easily sleeved), but the MSRP is within $5 of Agricola, which comes with a ton of little wooden bits. Consequently, I'm knocking of a half-point off rating. (So, you can do the math and figure out what I think of the game itself.)

With quite simple rules you have lot of depth in the game. Play your cards on the right moment to destroy your opponent pieces and accomplish a goal, place the piece directly on the board.
You need lot of spatial vision, if not you are lost. It is a game you need to play more than once to discover

An excellent hybrid, like many of Vlaada's games. However, prone to board stagnation or ragequits when played by folks who aren't familiar with it yet. I find that challenging, and so have mostly stopped trying to introduce it to friends.

Much like Mage Knight, there's the precise tactical puzzle of "can I grab this goal this turn, by any means?" and then the intuitive strategic game of "is that worth it?" -- and because taking goals almost always comes at high cost, but you have to do it SOMETIME, the interplay of these two layers is full of tension.

But, also like in Mage Knight, none of that is visible until you have some skill at the game, and the beginning can be tough.

Losing games as a novice is such a dismal experience for a lot of people that it took me a long time to rate this a 10. But that can be fixed with a little patience or a good teacher (or a handicap).

+3 for the interesting concept and that's as far as it goes. Poor design execution, awful component quality, leading to the conclusion that Vlaada has become Z-Man's cash cow.

I wrote up a lengthy review of this game with a lot of the problems --- cheap components, gameplay that makes you want to play a real game where you can use what you bring in, art that massively overuses the "female as sex object" sterotype.

It got too long, so I cut it down to: just don't buy this.

Fresh and unique mechanism of pattern matching optimization.  Despite the theme pretty abstract.  Can lead to serious AP.  Playing time of 30 minutes is a joke or a misprint.  "20-30 minutes per player" is more realistic.  Definitely one of the better games of Essen 2013.

Played at Spiel'13.

First off, this game needs 5-10 plays, as you won't know all the cards before then. Afterwards I guess this game will be much better.

Anyway, it reminds me of a more complicated version of "Summoner Wars", paired with "The Stars Are Right". This isn't meant to be a bad thing, it's just the next step from there.

I don't know if I will buy this game someday, because it's hard to play vs. ppl who are new to this, while "Summoner Wars" is way easier to get into. On the other side, it offers a much deeper game.

Some really cool and original ideas with some really tedious and obnoxious ideas mixed in.  The "scoring cards" are just not well done, and a "duel" style game will be a lot more fun.  Some of the scoring cards are nearly impossible to pull off while others are so easy they will get scooped before your turn.  I had a successful game from a card playing standpoint, dropping multiple legendarys in consecutive turns.... decimating opponents....  but not scoring any points because the scoring cards out there weren't what I needed.  That kind of stuff is frustrating.  

Also, the pattern system for playing cards is cool and original, but very tedious and monotonous as you spend the copious amount of downtime turning cards around in a circle, looking for patterns.

I played a four player VP game....  I think it would work a lot better as a two player duel.

Wow. Another Vlaada game. Man do i hate his games.

By now i should simply by chance have liked one of his games, since he's always trying new genres, but no. Hate them all.

The only viable strategy here i see is to memorize most off the 18 cards from the decks. Otherwise you simply react to the new situation to the best of your knowledge. 

But since you usually have no clue what your opponent has in his hand, there is no planing ahead about what he could do. You simply hope he doesn't have the right cards in his hand.

Flares are the blatant catch-up mechanic in this game. Because drawing the right cards is incredible lucky, people can get wiped out easily very early in the game. But instead of designing a balanced game Mr. Vlaada opted for flares. So whenever you're behind you get extra stuff. Fascinating!

But people will spend money on it, just like they did with all his other games.

It's a pretty neat game with very good mechanics and some ingenious catches but the neverending reading cards break the flow of the game and slow down a bit the game overall and the inbetween turns causing an awful downtime.

[b]First play:[/b] What a neat game. The board is constantly shifting as the players place, summon and destroy their and their opponent's stones. It was a very engaging experience as my brain contorted itself to visualize the patterns I need on the board, the patterns my wife was maybe making, and how they all fit with the  available tasks. Really good stuff that is only bound to get better as we learn these cards better. And there are still two more decks for us to play with!

Abstracto del gran Vlaada.

Sobre un tablero cuadriculado los jugadores tratan de ir creando fichas de su bando, para lo cual deben cumplir el patrón marcado por la carta. Al entrar en en el tablero las fichas/unidades son capaces de realizar algún movimiento/matar a otras unidades.

The game is very good.  Some might complain about control, esp. in 3-player games, but you can mitigate this by the knowledge of your and your opponents' decks.

Abstract feeling doesn't bother at all, because it IS an abstract game :D

Cool abstract game, I like that the cards add a little something above just placing pieces on the board. Trying to use them together to let you use more powerful ones is really cool. But like all of this designer's games, the scoring to me feels pretty tacked on. This is probably the game of his I want to like the most, so I want to keep trying it.

Such a great little game!  But it's basically an AP invitation, particularly in the closing stages.

Seems to have a lot of variants. The team variant wasn't to bad, but I expect I would hate the free for all variant. Seems like there are a lot of different variants and various different rules for each. I wasn't actually the one who read the rules but I got the feeling we played a mix and match rule set.

Sometimes you feel a little helpless, but otherwise it is a pretty addictive design. The green nation seems to be too weak compared to the others, or at least how we play it. Definitely not everyones cup of tea, and the analysis paralysis warning level is pretty high as well. Still one of our most played games currently.

RATING: 7
Outwardly a duel of wizards, Tash-Kalar is at heart an abstract, pattern recognition and strategy game.  Some people complain the game is theme-less, but I find it full.  The different races, the different powers, and the manner of summoning them on the board echo strongly of magic systems from many books I've read. Certainly it's more abstract compared to the concrete realizations of wizards duels in such games as Summoner Wars or Mage Wars, but not every game needs to have Fireballs of Death or other such spells to be "wizardly."  Essentially four games in one, Chvatil gives the players a choice how they want to duel, making the game versatile, and more replayable for it.  My only wish is that they had included one or two additional armies in the base game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2013)

While this game was a letdown thematically, I dig the abstract aspect of the game. I have only played it once with 4 players (never again) and the downtime was excessive. I still have high hopes for it as a two player game. The art is great and it is a very novel game (pattern creation and recognition), I really like how you need to outmaneuver your opponent to summon your own creatures, I’m worried about the luck of the draw, too many chances to get uncontrollable luck (your deck, the legendary deck, the flares deck). I’m also concerned about deck balance, the Wild deck had way too many free actions. I need to play more to see if this is indeed an issue. 

This is ONLY a two player game, with more players not only the downtime can be excessive, also, your actions lose relevance as the board will change a lot when you get to play again, making it a lot more random. 

I feel this is a good game, however with so many two great player games out there, I doubt I will play Tash-Kalar a lot, however I will give it the chance to woe me again ( the explainer made some rules mistakes), after I play again I will come back and re comment. I still have a lot of faith in Vlaada, one of my all-time favorite designers. 

When I play this game, I don’t feel the theme at all.

I finally played the game again and I read the rules!

The rulebook, as is usual from Vlaada Chvátil, is fun to read. There are two modes of play the High Form in which you score VPs doing tasks and Deathmatch Duel in which you destroy each other pieces for points. I like them both but I prefer to play the High Form.

Playtime is around 1 hour or less with experienced players.

Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends´ decisions aren’t obvious, in fact, they are very interesting and every decision has consequences. Forming the patterns isn’t easy and many times your opponent will disrupt your plans, but it is a fun puzzle to solve. The game has a lot more deepness that I initially thought, it rewards repeat plays.

I also feel it is more thematic than I felt the first time, still, it is mostly an abstract game.

The cards have great art.

Bottom line, I´m very glad I played the game again. Vlaada Chvátil didn’t let me down after all. I really like the game, but only as a 2 player game. I will play with the expansions soon, my desire to play the game is very high. Novel game.

I have been playing the game a lot and I’m enjoying it a lot. I already bought all its expansions and I preordered the new one. For me, Tash Kalar is only a two player game, if you play it with more players you do a disservice to yourself, I almost passed it up due to this, but the name of the designer made me try it again. It is a good game.

This game falls into a narrow, usually unsuccessful niche of game design, the hidden information abstract. Most fans of abstracts prefer to have perfect information. Most fans of hidden information games don't like their games to be abstract. Games that straddle these worlds tend to be unsatisfying for both camps and, in general, fail to excite much interest.

However, Tash-Kalar works. I still think those that strongly prefer perfect information abstracts or heavily-themed games won't like this, but those who are not so strict in their tastes will likely enjoy it. There are two versions of the game, High Form and Deathmatch, but I think the High Form shows the game at its best. It is a pattern game where a basic move entails placing a common piece on the board in any square. Pieces have three possible ranks (common, heroic, and legendary - in that order). You can also summon pieces to the board if a pattern you've created matches a pattern on one of your three cards. This is usually how you upgrade pieces and place higher ranks. Cards can also allow you to move pieces or eliminate opponent pieces. The objective is to get the most points by completing tasks. Three tasks with different criteria and points are active at any given time. They usually are achieved by matching required patterns or meeting single turn objectives. The game ends when a player gets 6 points (each task is worth 1-3 points) or one player's deck has been exhausted. Each card is single use.

Despite the limitations of the card play, I think this game works because it is a contest for points rather than elimination. If the goals of the game were absolute - eliminate your opponent's pieces, for example - then the use of cards would be maddening. However, the way this is designed makes it feel more like a eurogame than an abstract and I think the variable tasks open for either player to complete really makes the game.

This is a much simpler design than we have seen from Chvatil and as such a bit of a surprise. This game shows that he doesn't necessarily require the complicated set of rules that most of his games feature in order to produce something of quality. Chvatil is the best designer of the last few years and Tash-Kalar shows that he is still at the peak of his powers and showing no sign of a decline.

I like the abstract idea of the game, hope to try more soon! I really don't mind that it's really dry and non-thematic. It's hard to judge the mechanics and replayability after one game though.

The enjoyment I get out of the hand management is comparable to the one caused by the Command & Color series. Chvatil further spices it up with his usual dose of chaos and contradicts this by putting this mix on an abstract chassis. On top, he adds two different play modes (high form with points or melee i.e. deathmatch) and a possibility for team play.
It must be the abstract framework why it gets a comparably modest reaction on the geek even though with Chvatil + fantasy it features two BGG mainstays. After two high form games with two players, it's my favourite Chvatil game besides Space Alert. Once into the game I didn't notice any more that the board looks terrible. Its unadorned nature helps focussing on gameplay and the design of the cards more than compensates for the lack of initial attraction.

Need to play the full 2-player game.

Highly tactical gladiator battle that may take very long with four players, but it is still a very enjoyable slugfest. With two players this is a very smooth experience. The game is very much an abstract affair, but the flavor of the cards makes you partially forget the abstractness. It feels a bit like comboing in MtG, but this time on board. I'm a bit wary of long term replayability which may be hindered if you learn the cards too well.

Didn't play a full game but enough to get a sense. It's interesting to see what patterns you can make but (like onitama, but less so cos you could get to know the whole deck) I find using and getting rid of cards irritating. Especially since it's not easy to know what your opponent is up to. Would be much better if you could hold all your cards and then discard...

Sadly enough it's too abstract for me to rate it higher... if I'd evaluate this just on personal opinion it would score higher.

Tash-Kalar is an abstract game where you summon tiles into the arena to then use these to power your summoning to bring forth even greater entities. Well, that's the fluff anyway. The game itself is a constant summoning of new pieces in the hope you can use them to perform certain tasks and win the favor of the crowd (aka score VP).

2015-06-04 - 6.5 - I played twice so far. It's a little bit prone to analysis paralysis. You need to switch your mind to looking for those patterns on the board. It's rather dry, but there is a little of theme. It wasn't that great, but not bad and second game was better, so I want to give it another try or two. 

2015-06-15 - 6.5->6 - I rethought my rating and I think I don't need to play it again. I wouldn't mind if someone would like to play it. I will try to trade this game.

Played half a game of it and it seemed promising; placing tokens in patterns, and playing character cards which add and manipulate tokens based on the available patterns. Nice mesh of abstract and theme, with the characters just becoming generic tokens after they hit the board. Felt like it might over-reward memorising all the card patterns, though.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a game from which one benefits by knowing/learning the cards and what they do.  It is very abstract but done in such a way that I don't really think about it in that way.  There is some planning ahead although much is quite tactical in nature if your opponent messes with your plans (quite easy for this to happen).  High form is the only way I've played thus far.  I'm uncertain why the game is so expensive with such chinzy components although the card art isn't bad.  I look forward to future plays although I expect that this will be almost solely a two player game as the 3-4 player game is very different and usually is team play, etc.

Not a "big" game, but not a small game either, and a solid one at that.

I like the way the patterns are thematic (a bomb that must be started a turn before it explodes, a canon that fires in one direction,…). This makes it easier to remember, and therefore plan around.

I like the fact that the board evolves qualitatively: more and more heroic pieces appear (and remain, because they are stronger than common pieces): this gives me the pleasure of accomplish or building something, of being able to summon stronger and stronger creatures, and this creates new situations, and another level of planning (where to put the stronger pieces, etc.).

I like the goals: they give something explicit to fight over. I like having some clear and simple goals that require some serious strategizing. I like knowing the goals of my opponent because this gives me the additional goal of trying to mess up with theirs (like in Race for the Galaxy).

A very solid "smaller" game, a good addition to my shorter abstracts (Hive, Yinsh, but also Blue Moon,…). Almost in the same category as small more thematic/varied games like Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation and Hellas.

I don't see the complaints about the components. The board is not very thick but seems serviceable. The cards are well printed and well cut (better than Robinson's, Ares's, Innovation (Iello)…), maybe a little thin but nothing too bad, and they slide nicely (not too much). The counters are not super thick but are thick enough.

I'm still not a big fan of the fact that it is quite hard to plan, as it is easy for your opponent to destroy one of two pieces and ruin your plan for a pattern.

I like the flares (even if they can be a "cheap" way of bringing balance to the game): (1) they keep the game interesting by making it a real fight and (2) they add a layer of strategy, since a player might want to play in a way that denies flares to the opponent (if he feels that they are powerful).

At 4 games, I enjoy the game more and more: I can see more and more clearly in it, I pay attention to more and more details (where we are on the board with respect to each other, which "distance" between factions is adapted to which factions, etc.).

I remain concentrated for the whole game: thanks to the goal, there is always something to pay attention to, using the cards's potential at their maximum is an interesting puzzle, etc.

Despite being a "small game" (not the variety of games like Magic, Agricola, Race,…), it is a game that keeps me deeply involved and mostly feeling in control: this is a great experience. Similar to a very good and "serious" abstract like Yinsh, despite the somewhat more volatile board.

Very good rulebook: with strategic advice, reasons behind some design choices, clear and consistent wording…

Ein echt gutes Spiel, auch wenn es mir so gar nicht liegt, weil ich die Konstellationen nicht gut sehe.
Wer an der Reihe ist hat 2 Aktionen. Eine ist einen Chip aufs Spielbrett zu legen. Eine andere ist eine Karte auszuspielen, das darf man aber nur, wenn man die auf der Karte angegebene Konstellation auf dem Brett bereits liegen hat. Die dritte Möglichkeit ist eine ausliegende Legende zu beschwören (sehr komplexe Konstellation) und mit der vierten darf man seine Handkarten abwerfen und neu ziehen.
Mit den ausgespielten Karteneffekten kann man Gegnerische Steine angreifen und erhält Punkte für zerstörte Einheiten.
Das Spiel endet sobalt jemand in einer Farbe mehr als 12 Punkte gemacht hat oder ein Spieler sein Deck durch hat. Wer jetzt in der niedrigsten Farbe mehr Punkte hat, gewinnt.

Die Eismenschen spielen sich super und ich konnte mein Deck komplett leer spielen und somit das Spielende einläuten.

Die Niederhöllen spielen sich im Vergleicht zur Eisnation sehr einfach und fasst schon Grundspielvolkartig. Die Pforte wird nicht unbedingt zur Beschwörung gebraucht, ergibt aber einen Bonus wenn sie hier oder dort steht. Insgesammt ganz nett, aber der Favorit bleibt die Eisnation, es fehlt mir aber noch die neuste Rasse (lila, irgendwas mit Zeit), die ich noch testen muss.

I was a little apprehensive about this one, as what I'd read about it made it sound like a weird, brain-burny abstract. And it is, to some extent, but it's still pretty fun. It's cool to figure out neat combos and pull them off, even when it's being used against you. I'm not much for abstracts, but this one was a good time.

Tried once with three-player deathmatch. Not impressed. 
Played introductory two-player high form. More impressed. 

Random thoughts:
- More tactical then strategic. 
- Tasks do not fit well with theme. 
- Tasks require planning, but game is tactical. 
- Placing tokens is more important than summoning, which is odd because summoning is the interesting mechanic. 

So far I like the idea more than the execution. Will play more.

I only played 2p.  I didn't think that I would like this game, and was very pleasantly surprised.  It's an abstract game with many cards with text, and I usually don't care much for abstracts and dislike games where you have to spend time learning individual cards.  However, the mechanics are elegant and almost intuitive, with a tactical, spatial, puzzle element that keeps the game fresh and moving along at a brisk pace.  I like how the board mutates, how the game pace changes over time, how you have enough options every move that you don't feel trapped or having to always follow the same strategy.  So the game has two qualities I really enjoy in games -- the freshness and speed of a card game, with the spatial element of a good area control or abstract game.  The high form and deathmatch allow you to satisfy two different playstyles and add to the game's replayability.  A very pleasant surprise.

RATING: 8
So far we’ve only delved into the high form duel game, and felt that we’ve only scratched the surface of possible tactics, let alone strategy. In what seems to become a well-established tradition, it is completely different from every other Chvatil game, and also veers away from all trends the hobby has taken in recent years. For successful play, it demands good knowledge of all summoning patterns in the game, which means that we’ll have a good number of learning games ahead of us before we’re starting to play the game itself.

While the necessity to know different patterns is similar to chess, the unique idea of Tash-Kalar is that the different abilities are fleeting, and once your stone is on the board, it’s no longer special. Apart from a good fit to the theme, this makes for a unique exercise in pattern recognition: the potential development of the board situation is far more important than what’s actually there, and this development can be very dramatic indeed.

If this is only somewhat properly balanced, it will stay at an 8. Based on Chvatil’s track record, I feel justified in hoping that the other 2 player decks will be well integrated with the basic decks, and that the multiplayer rules work as well as the duel does. And in that case, this will soon go to a rating of 9, or even a 10.

Based on the introductory game, I quite like this. I like that it's a fight-y abstract with lots of different ways to play, that there appears to be a lot of depth under the surface, that it's easy to learn and teach, and that it includes plenty of variability (card draws, flare draws, task draws). It feels like the kind of game that, when played by two folks who know what they're doing, would be quick and very dirty.

Pattern recognition, that's the main characteristic of Tash-Kalar. You try to find pattern to summon your fighters, but at the same time you try to find a way to fulfill quests. And that's the crux in this game.

Very interesting Abstract game. I like the theme a lot and the game play easy to learn, mostly.

Buut it can really drag with AP players as the pattern building takes a while to get ones head around.

Not really my sort of game it should be faster like a real battle

From my wonderful 2014 BGG Secret Santa.
Tash-Kalar is a hard game to try to explain completely without resorting to a shrug and a hope that people will play it long enough to understand all the interconnected nuances that make the game tense, frustrating, thoughtful, and rewarding all at the same time.  What first seems chaotic and frustratingly out of one's control eventually resolves itself into a network of interconnected strengths and strategies, weaknesses and traps for each different deck all held together in a matrix tight enough to function as a legitimate entry into the abstract genre despite each side not being a mirror image.  That is a true triumph, but more importantly, it is a heck of a game once you mount the curve.

THIS. GAME. IS. HYPNOTIZING. Played 3 times as soon as I got it and then had weirdo dreams filled with patterns and beasts.

The game was very anxiety-provoking due to its super tactical nature. It gives me a similar feeling to Mage Knight (only amplified by a million) of having to puzzle through all the various permutations that are available to do what you want each turn. Because your opponent messes up your patterns every time, you really have to make the most of what is available so each turn is like an individual puzzle. The board can go from nearly full to half empty in a turn or two. It's so crazy and addictive!

RATING: 5
Abstracted game where players use cards to summon creatures onto the board by matching patterns of one's already played pieces. More complex patterns can bring out stronger creatures. The creatures are really just more checkers on the board but they each have a power that can move these checkers or destroy those of others, etc. The game comes with catch-up mechanisms (extra actions) to help balance the fact that otherwise the strong would just get stronger over the weak factions with the ability to destroy and place more as more pieces equates to further pattern-building flexibility.

Played a 3-player melee and found that it was somewhat chaotic in that the pattern's you're setting up in order to summon could easily be wiped out by the time your turn came around again. In this way, the game is extremely tactical. Personally I found it difficult at time to spatially see all of the patterns or how to build them with my hand of cards. Would probably be easier if I stood up and walked around the board.

Cool ideas, but not something I look to play much more in the future.

A very interesting and fairly intense game.  Pattern matching to either eliminate you opponent or achieve various goals.  Forethought is rewarded as goals can be chained together nicely...but too much planning will get you into trouble as pattern disruption from your opponent is bound to occur.

This was a game I tried only because of the designer... if the game wasn't from Vlaada Chvátil I most certainly would never have played it!!!

Why? Because it looks terribly abstract, it looks dull and bland... it has a strong spacial element, a thing that I'm not particularly good at or like...
So this one hits all the buttons for me to stay away, but like I said, it's from Vlaada, and I have to say, I really really liked the game and will certainly play it again!

A visually engaging, tactical tit-for-tat game that is easy to teach, plays quickly and is brainy fun in an abstract way.  Despite the surface similarities, this is not at all like go or chess or other games of high strategy.  To me, it feels more like smash-up or innovation. It is a card game where your tactical choices really matter, but the chaos of the game limits your ability to plan beyond the next move.

Easily the most interesting strategy game I've come across in ages. Very simple rules and deep strategy, requiring a complex mixture of skills: visual and spatial imagination, good hand management, piece management, ability to suss out or bluff your opponent... Though I'll play any form of Tash-Kalar, 2-player High Form is where it's at.

Also, the decks have wonderfully different flavours. I like Sylvan deck (which tends to create big forest/moss/algae-like patterns) and Everfrost (orthogonal lattices). I'd knock the rating of the game down from 10 to 9 for the cheesy somewhat sexist art on the Sylvan deck, but I just can't...I like this game too much.

Best art is the Nethervoid deck, though. Yowsers. (And yes it's got a few pin-up girls in there too.)

FOOTNOTE: For those who complain about the flares as a "catch-up mechanism": no one thinks that capturing pieces whenever you can in chess is a good idea, right? Same thing here: unfocused destructiveness and greediness are deservedly penalized.

It has interesting concepts with the way you summon units, and a lot of strategy in determining what to play and where to play them. Takes a lot of effort (brain power) to play in the puzzle game sense.

Seems way more complicated to understand than it should be. Haven't played it much yet, but isn't a game I really enjoy. I give it points for uniqueness but I'm not sold or ever really want to play this. Max 4 players is also a major minus.

Stimulates very much the same itch as Summoner Wars and Innovation, but unlike those games, this a very streamlined abstract game. Being able to summon a legendary creature on the final action of the final turn of the game, to painstakingly turn a loss into a victory with long-term planning -- priceless and awesome! The color-coded rules sheet (with full rules for all game modes) is a work of art, with very polished rules (as with Mage Knight board game). Most of the hate for this game seems to stem from a few very loud haters... A guy called Aaron is hating this everywhere at once. :) Do not be put off. If you like abstracts like Hive AND tactical madness such as Summoner Wars or Innovation, you will adore this one.

RATING: 7
Players use their actions to put pieces on the board or summon a creature from the deck, which may come on the board with special effects. To summon a creature, you have to meet a certain pattern on the board. The board is  checker board, with some squares that are green or red that match some of the objective cards for VPs. 

In the normal game, you are trying to meet certain objectives to score VPs. An optional game is the death match where you score points for destroying your opponent's pieces. 

I like the planning aspect of trying to form patterns, but obviously your opponent can disrupt your plans. The flares add a layer of strategy to it as well. It tends to take a bit long between turns, and even your turn you can take a long time to find the "optimal" move. I think if you are really experienced, then this game will shine, but otherwise, it can bog down as you analyze your position. It's fun, but there are many possibilities to consider and I think that is a negative for this game.

I didn't expect to like this much as it looked quite abstract.  As it was by Vlaada and I LOVED Mage Knight and Galaxy Trucker, I thought I'd give it a go.  Absolutely love it, definitely one of my favourite games for 2 players.

Although it's quite abstract, there are some very clever thematic touches.  I love how the patterns on the card relate to their name (Knight, Griphon Rider etc).

Lots of potential for pulling off big combos to score big and frustrate your foe.  I wasn't sure how it'd go with my wife, who tends not to like games with lots of screwage, but it's been a hit.

Nice twist on a chess-like abstract. The overarching goal is not to capture your opponents pieces [i]per se[/i], but rather fulfill any of a set of objectives for points, and most points wins. These objectives range from capturing opponents pieces to having one's pieces display a particular pattern to summoning a certain number of legendary beings (which involves playing a card after getting one's pieces to display a particular pattern). Sounds good in theory, but it's not that much fun in the playing. Also, there's a lot of messing with other players' pieces, which is a turn off for me.

RATING: 8.5
A rather left-field pattern-matching game, but really enjoyable especially for those (like me) who have a history in abstracts. It rewards multiple plays and also plays quickly. I really like it.

So far I've only played Deathmatch, because I like killing stuff. It's quite hard to come back from a disadvantage here. High Form may be better in this regard.

RATING: 7.4
Brilliantly designed abstract game. You place pieces in a checkered matrix trying to make forms or combos that will make you win points, setup a favourable situation to make new forms in the next round while trying to destroy enemy pieces to prevent him from doing the same.
-> Requires some thinking.
-> Evident catch-up mechanic that works very well.
- More tactic than strategic: long term planning is minimal, because the board disposition will change constantly during your rival's turn.
- To be played in High Form mode. Deathmach is a less appealing variant.

If you read all of the flavor text in the instructions and give yourself over to the theme then this becomes so much more than just a brain burning abstract game.  It's hard to come back if the luck of the draw favors one of the players, but this is a very unique puzzler that will stay in my collection.

RATING: 6
Tash-Kalar starts with a fantastic premise: a fight on the board in which goals must be reached via building specific patterns on the board with their pieces, that normally can't be moved. Easier patterns can enable the invocation of "special creatures", i.e. cards that cause rather drastic effects on the board and bring special pieces onto it as well. If one player falls too far behind the other one, special effects can be called for to balance the play.

All this reads really promising but unfortunately the effects caused by the creatures are so brutal that the game turns into a rather frustrating fist fight with barely any long-term or even mid-term planning. The hands are relatively small, so that the most destructive use of one's turn (which nearly always means the best one) can be worked out pretty easily. What is left is an attempt to reach a goal on a turn by using the cards in your hand (half of them new if you play hard enough to defend yourself) and the shreds left by your opponent on the previous turn. The way to get better is knowing well the decks of cards in play and estimating risks for one card or the other to come up next.

This is basically my go-to card-duelling game.

I really enjoy it and so does my friend (which is always a plus). It's of course a little more on the abstract side (which actually he likes) but also not too abstract (which I like) as it still has luck and hidden information in it. The artwork of the cards is really nice and I appreciate that the patterns usually make sense, which adds a little bit of theme to it. 
It also feels "fresh" in a way that I have not really played anything similar. 
I'm a little sceptical about some of the playing modes and have the feeling some were mainly added to increase player numbers, although I have to say that I don't mind as much having more options as it won't take away from the option that I do quiet enjoy. 
So far we just played with two and I enjoy the High form much more as it involves a little more planing as you have to (and actually can) keep an eye on what the other player plans. In the confrontational match it's basically just you and your stones and what destroys the most. I was however surprised that I still enjoy it more than I thought just because in our hands this variant plays much quicker and then becomes more of a filler which is then enjoyable enough.

Way more abstract than I was expecting given the theming. Place your pieces on the board in patterns that match one or more of your cards. Then play a card when you have the pattern on the board to conduct its power, which might be to upgrade pieces, place more pieces or attack an opponent's pieces. There's a few formats, which is attractive at least, one being to achieve tasks (bigger piece formations) and another being to furiously whack your opponent's pieces as fast as you can, always by playing cards. The more upgraded pieces you have, the harder they are to be whacked (there's less cards that whack them). The aim each turn is to try and upset whatever your opponent placed last turn, as it's presumably part of creating a pattern setup that's going to hurt you next turn. If you can do that by creating or using your own existing pattern setups that gets card powers played, even better. If not, then maybe setup for a following turn and hope that your opponent won't upset your plans too much. With your pieces continually entering and leaving the board, it's all very abstracted, with a fair bit of downtime whilst analysing options and trying to work out best plays. While these decisions may have been engaging, it wasn't as much fun as the theme would suggest and that disconnect resulted in disappointment.

I like it a lot!

First of all I love the diversification between Vlada games. I mean how much farming can come out of Uwe Rosenberg before they imprison him?

I own Kahuna wich is an abstract game and my personal favorite BUT no one wants to play with me. This one gives enough theme and well crafted components to make it appealing to everyone and enough depth to keep a gamer satisfied.

Warning for those about to buy! Take it if you want a 2 player game. I had lots of great moments playing multiplayer and it's always there for you if you need it, but the game is made for 2!

Vlada is an honest, gifted and hardworking designer. I just watched a video of overated games on dice tower, accusing him of making the same type of game over and over again.

Just played 4 games in a row. The game is easy to learn and has yet sone very deep strategical choices. Some long term strategies are also available by trying to get some legends to the arena or to fullfill the goal-cards. Fine also with 3 players. The 3 and 4 player games are lasting a little to long. The game itself is rather abstract. The theme enhances my enjoyment for the game as the cards are stunning to look at. Another great Vlaada game. Bravo!!!

3 plays - Not a bad abstract game, but simply not the best either. Without a lot of play, I feel the challenge is more in 'seeing' how to translate the card patterns onto the board, rather than the strategy of placing them. The objectives work really well though and are actually 'fun and challenging. Not enough to make up for the way the cards make me feel dizzy.

This game initially felt abstract until you read the fluff from the front page and you begin to understand what you're actually doing in the arena. Then this game comes to life. Summoning creatures for a few seconds to do a large attack before turning back into stone. What a great concept that works really well. For only having 2(3) options, this game really bends your mind.

Not sure how well it will hold up to 3-4 players, but it's great with just 2. Maybe teams might work better. As of right now, this game will be either a 10 or settle on an 8. It's good, but it might be hard to get to the table.

Vlaada strikes again! I bought this without having played it, simply because of the designer. True to form, it is a unique game. Can I call it a highly-thematic abstract? Does that even make sense? How about Go crossed with Summoner Wars? Or maybe Chess and Magic The Gathering? It’s very hard to classify. Unlike many of Chvatil’s games, this one is quite easy to learn. A player gets two actions on her turn. She can place a common unit on the board, or summon a creature by playing a card. In order to summon, she must have an appropriate pattern of stones on the board. After summoning, a player will often get to move her pieces around and destroy an opponent’s pieces. There are four ways to play. The High Form has two players competing to achieve goals that will impress the audience. Melee mode is all about destroying opponents’ pieces. I haven’t yet tried the other two, but I’m looking forward to the team game. 

I suspect like many of Chvatil’s games, people will feel quite strongly about Tash-Kalar, one way or another. It won’t be for everyone, but those who like it, including yours truly, will like it quite a bit. The game is quite tactical, with the board state changing significantly and often. Games play rather quickly (less than 45 min) even though there are times when the spatial puzzling out of a turn can be a little slow. I think that there is quite a bit of depth to plumb with this one. Initial rating: 8.

Hidden information and broad options for your actions make all of your turns feel impactful and powerful. 3 and 4 player games become a bit of a chaotic slog, so I only ever pull this out with 2. But it's my favorite 2-player game.

The artwork here is really nice, but that's about it.

The game itself is ok, but the theme is just pasted on

Cute, but ultimately I found this to be too random to like. You place tokens on the board trying to make patterns to place more tokens and attack your opponents tokens, but ultimately you and your opponent are just sort of flailing tokens at each other, unknowingly interrupting or not interrupting each others plans. We were doing the green achievement mode, but we spent so much time nuking each others setups that we grabbed very few actual points. This game might be good for other people, it definitely rewards repeat play as you get to know the cards available in each of the four decks, but for me I think it was just a bad fit.

Review is based on one 3P game of Deathmatch:
Interesting card drafting/ pattern making game, the game seems to provide a lot of options at a turn but if you are attacked then your options are limited. Catchup can be  difficult as a dominance on the board allows the player to make patterns easily and use more powerful cards.

What a game. Truly escapes any categorization. In many ways really fresh and revolutionary. A fine mix of pattern recognition, Go and a card game.

It's not for everyone though. This is a title you need to play several times until you grasp the basics of strategy and subtleties. It can be extremely punishing for players doing bad moves. It's really not a game to try out casually.

In many ways similiar to Go. You place pieces, you look for certain patterns, you threaten and answer to threats. You fight for certain groups or you give up the fight and shift to other part. I often feel like during Android: Netrunner sessions - do I play this card now or later? Do I use this or discard to look for other cards? Do I attack here or there? Do I fake that pattern there or not? There's a lot of tension throughout the game and there are those swinging "opportunity windows". You can so something now or not but if you don't, the window will shut and you will have to work again to open it. So good!

The high form is an euro like variant. Task cards definitely favor those holding the centre and it's sometimes harder to win. Depending on how the game progresses and the nature of tasks, it can be either a race for points or a cutthroat festival of backstabbing. In deathmatch, it's even more straightforward and balanced, but lacks the additional positional aspect the high form introduces.

Decks look and play quite unique and balanced. A there's definitely place for more factions and perhaps even for deck building. Playing with two symmetric factions is great fun and it's easier to anticipate and react.

What's really a problem for this game is, ironically, that it's Vlaada game. It tries to be thematical a bit too much and it takes this pretentious name of tash kalar and this whole image of epic mage battles. The manual also features typical Vlaada "story helper" which feels reallu out of płace here. All this crust wasnt necessary and since people expect a heavy thematical euro from Vlaada, they really don't understand what they look on and feel cheated, when they get pseudo abstract logical puzzle game with a heavy confrontational aspect. Meanwhile, seriously if you play chess and mtg or netrunner, you should looooove this. Scratches the same itch while offering serious depth.

It also definitely has tournament potential. One of the best games of this year.

"Okay game" is probably the right descrpition. Wanted to like it more, but sadly I did not. I didn't expect it to be super thematic, no - I was looking for an abstract game with just a bit of theme and interaction, and that's exactly what you get, but it just falls... flat. With two players, it's not VERY chaotic, but you can't control everything, and that's fine. With more, I wouldn't touch it with a stick. Harsh, I know, but that's how I feel about it. (On a side note, "Theseus" is, in my opinion, a lot better, and a lot more FUN, abstract game with a touch of theme).

The factions feel samey (even the one from the expansion). Sure, you get different abilities, but it's still a game of patterns. So it's my turn, I put my tokens here and there in hope to summon something next turn. But I won't, because my opponent does it first and destroys some of my tokens. In esence, it's a game of cat and mouse. Both players try to make patterns and eventually someone will - only to carry out a simple action and do the same thing over and over for the next several turns. There's no thrill to it, no building up of tension.

So much better than I thought it would be. Really, the game has a very basic mechanic of laying soldiers out in patterns to allow the summoning of more powerful soldiers. This could have easily been a very mediocre wargame, but the scoring goals and player interaction are well thought out and never leave a dull moment. Yet,I think Vlada's genius has only begun to fly with Tash-Kalar, and this could easily become a favorite with an expansion or two.

I received this as an unexpected Christmas present from my wife in 2013 (strictly speaking, it was from her sister, but I know who told her what to buy for me :)). Unexpected because, although this was my absolute top must-have 2013 release, I had discussed it with her and she had declared she had absolutely no interest in playing it whatsoever. (I had already decided to buy it no matter what...) Apparently she only got it for me because she couldn't find copies of some of the other games on my list!

However, as it turns out, she actually really likes the game, and we play it not infrequently. She is - as with most games - much better than me, particularly in the Deathmatch form. I personally didn't love it quite as much as I thought I would (although I still enjoyed it), but some more plays, starting in November/December 2014 (inspired by us picking up the Everforst expansion) have sent it further upwards in my opinion. It's fun trying to plan the best possible use of the cards in your hand - whether to use them now for some benefit, or try to save them for later for a (hopefully) better effect. And summoning legends is always fun, whether it directly helps you or not :)

I don't think I ever want to play the 3 and 4-player forms of this though. Even with 2 it's rather chaotic - there's little point planning for your next turn because most of the pieces you need are likely to have disappeared from the board by then. But the game is an absolute blast, with plenty of tactics and I have no doubt a decent amount of strategy too.

I still only give this an 8 rating as I don't find myself wanting to play this all the time, nor is it one of my absolute first choices on a regular basis. But it's certainly in my top 20 or 30, which is no small achievement.

Esse não é necessariamente o jogo dele que eu mais gosto, mas é o que mais fala ao meu estilo de jogo.

Achei ele uma mistura de Tigris com Kingdom Builder. Tem combate, mas assim como no KB, é preciso ter boa visão espacial para usar as cartas de maneira eficiente. Suspeito que quem gosta de outros jogos do Vlaada, como Dungeon Lords e Petz, não vai se animar tanto com esse, que é realmente bem diferente. 

Acho que comecei a detectar um estilo na variedade imensa de jogos que ele cria. Todos (exceção a Through the Ages) têm um puzzle temporal. O enfrentamento dos cavaleiros no DL, a exposição de animais do DP, os obstáculos do Galaxy Trucker. Em todos, você precisa sequenciar suas ações levando em consideração a ordem em que as coisas surgem. Sequenciando mal, você toma mais dano dos cavaleiros / dos asteróides / não expõe um monstro bom e, no caso do Tash-Kalar, não consegue invocar tantos monstros quanto poderia.

RATING: 8.5
Tash-Kalar is an odd beast, strategic on paper but in the end tactical to the highest degree. Some games can really drag back and forth when playing in high-form which can be frustrating. But deathmatches are just a luck fest that are best forgotten were included in the box.

This game can also be a chore when playing with AP prone players (I am one of them!), and I therefore recommend playing online async, which is my preferred, and well, sole way to enjoy the game. Do buy the game though, to support CGE ;-)

Original release: sub-par components just don't work in a genre that I expect to come with a largely tactile and non-random environment.

Updated components: the second release sorts out some of the component issues, although I fear for an abstract game the components still lacks some substance.

Still, don't let all of this put you off, this is a clever game that many designers could only dream of pulling off. Fans of Tigris & Euphrates (although quite a different game) will utterly rejoice in the tactical challenge which gets better with every play!

Juego, de 2 a 4 jugadores, de invocación de criaturas en la arena, y que se gana consiguiendo puntos por misiones logradas. Las criaturas de tres rangos de fuerza, se invocan consiguiendo colocar fichas de fuerza inferior en la arena, según los patrones que se encuentran en las cartas de invocación.
Impresionante juego, como no, de Vlaada. Muy recomendable.

Feels a lot like chess to me in the level of thinking required, and yet somehow I still like it. Probably has something to do with the fact that [person=789][/person] designed it... I've enjoyed every game of his that I've tried.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are commendable mechanisms at play here: area control, pattern laying, and the kind of peculiar knack of Vlaada to inject his game with theme--this time summoning various creatures and magical beings of high fantasy and beyond. The thematic touch seems to be associated with the patterns that you create to summon said beings. The game also has a unique comeback mechanism using "flares", which keep your opponent from completely swallowing the board if they have the lead. Overall, a fun head-to-head game that does not quite possess the type of elegance present in some of my favorite abstracts, but the glitz and pizzazz of the card powers add some welcome flavor when in the mood for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
a neat game about spatial patterns and special powers.  It's well balanced.  Your opponent's hidden hand prevents the game from becoming too computational, and yet you can still plan ahead a couple of turns reasonably.  A nice balance!

Too bad it only really works 2 player, and I don't have much call for 2 player games.  But it is a very solid design.

05-06-2014. Rated after 1 play and commented a while after playing. Fun puzzly game in which you play cards to place tokens to obtain objectives. While I think TK is a good game, I do not think I want or need it in my collection. It seems to me that I like other (confrontational) card games (ie. Magic the Gathering, Ascension etc) better, mainly because I do not like puzzling all the time. Another reason behind my dislike probably is due to the game being ridiculously overpriced in Europe. Thanks Z-man!

RATING: 9
Try to find patterns amidst the chaos of your other tokens, and use those patterns to do special moves that help you secure objectives and screw up your opponent's plans. I like that even if you start dominating the board, that might give the opponent the opportunity to use a Flare card (read: catch-up mechanic) and combo that into a monster turn and bring things back into balance. The game could induce some AP in some, and I would recommend only playing 2 or maybe 3 players max, as with 4 the board state changes so much it's harder to pull off what you're trying to do, but it's still an excellent game.

+ The theme informs the gameplay brilliantly, but you have to use your imagination to see it (which, for me, is a plus). 
+ Involves pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and visualization of how the state of the board could evolve. 
+ Artwork looks beautiful and magical, for the most part. 
+ Pulling off a complex summoning creates a great feeling of accomplishment. 

- Games can get rather tense and agressive, so it's not something that I'm always in the mood to play. 
Minor issues: 
- Some task cards would benefit from clear indication that the diagram contains essential information, because that's not the case for all tasks and people may get in the habit of not looking closely at the diagrams - which means they can get tripped up by ambiguous task descriptions without realizing it. Unnecessarily frustrating, especially for new players. 
- The art on some cards in the Sylvan deck is tacky.

This game was one of the highest targets for me when I decided to playtest new gems at Spiel '13 in Essen. I am a huge Chvatil-fan but I have to say that this game didn't thrill me very much. It's too abstract and the atmosphere of a legendary arena doesn't come up by placing tiles and patterns.
Although it's mentioned to be a four-player-game this one seems to be best with just two players. Not my kind.

An interesting concept with a cool spacial element and some really nice artwork.  Vlaada once again has made something cool.  That said, this game brought out AP like I've never had before.  In a 4 player game you can TRY to predict what will be available on your turn, but the board state will very likely change by then (particularly in the end game).  If you want to maximize your turn, you may have to think through a large number of things.  I enjoyed it, but I probably would stick to the 2 player game as a result.

Not sure what to think of this one. It's fun enough to play, and feels a bit like an abstract. But unless you've played it a million times you have no idea what your opponents' possible moves are. So it feels a bit solitairish in the end, as you just do your own thing trying to make a pattern known only to yourself.

What a great game, so different and unique. Usually something different and unique will put people off because it is hard to understand. The unique here is a benefit. It starts out semi fast paced. Then you stop to look at your cards, the board and how it is possible to gain more points with objectives. The game slows to a steady pace as the wheels turn, and picking the correct steps to victory. 

You start with a strategy, then BOOM they destroy your pieces. Your shake your fist and start another idea. Make a move and swears are happening on the other side of the table. HAHA. Every turn is a new puzzle that needs to be solved. Great game.

This game is truly special.  A really satisfying brain-burner.  I love the progression of power, how you start out struggling to summon a common being and can end up summoning legendary creatures and bursting out with surprise moves to claim tasks in the final round.  I love that in this game, stunning upsets are entirely possible and yet you cede them to your opponent's tactical superiority (and a little bit of luck).

In my initial impression, after two "beginner" games without the Legendary beings yet, I felt that the first player was at a disadvantage because the second player would often be able to summon a being in their second turn (starting with 2 pieces on the board) whereas the first player would constantly be playing catch-up and finding it hard to have enough pieces on the board to summon beings.  But at that point I had already decided that I would love to play more to find out, and bought sleeves for my cards.

As expected, this is an abstract game and, as such, not my style. It's not totally dry, though:
- it has a (pasted on) theme -- summon unique creatures to fight in the arena
- victory conditions are variable: a deck of VP cards with different requirements each; you only see a few at a time
- there's a catch up mechanism where, if you are far enough behind in board position, you have access to a deck of special action cards
Still, it's a game of pattern creation/recognition. Use your actions to summon creatures (cards), which come onto the board based on specific board configurations and land in a specific space relative to your other pieces (both specified on the card), and immediately transform into a generic 1- or 2- strength token. Meet the conditions of the visible VP cards to claim them. It's pretty cool, but also somewhat annoying how difficult it can be to create the patterns you want, especially when the other player can often undo whatever you're trying to do each turn!

Interesting, but probably not for me.

Not what I was expecting. Is more frustrating than I would have hoped for, lots of random crap happens. It isn't random like dice rolls, or drawing a bad card, it was random because when it was not my turn, the other players would mess up what I was trying to build. So much crap, but in theory ...

RATING: 6
I'm not usually a fan of two player abstract strategy games.  Sometimes the mechanics of a game will interest me at least a bit, such as in the case of The Duke or Confusion.  The mechanics of this game were definitely interesting sounding and I thought the fantasy theme would elevate it a little bit more for me.  Plus I'm a big Chvatil fan.

In this game players get two actions a turn and their actions consist of placing common pieces on the board or if their pieces are in a certain formation playing cards that summon a special piece onto the board.  These special pieces provide bonus abilities on the turn they are summoned then they become just other basic pieces used for other summoning formations.  The "high form" game has players doing this competing to fulfill the requirements for tasks that provide points.  There is also a deathmatch variant that does away with the tasks in favor of simply causing the most harm to your opponent.

Disappointingly the theme didn't elevate this game any higher for me and I still just don't get much enjoyment out of 2 player abstract strategy games.  I didn't really feel the theme at all really, it just ended up feeling like another chess-style game.

The mechanics are indeed interesting so it did garner a little bit of interest from me but there is an inherent luck problem with the way the mechanics are presented.  You only get to have 3 cards from your personal deck in your hand and sometimes your opponent will have more useful cards than you in any particular situation or just the right ones needed to fulfill a valuable task.  I like luck-of-the-draw in a lot of games but abstract strategy games like this feel to me like they should be deterministic.

I did enjoy the flare mechanic though.  Each player always has one "catch up" card in their hand in case their opponent starts to overpower them too badly.  These cards require your opponent to have more pieces on the board than you and they can be played without consuming one of your actions so you can regain some ground.

All-in-all an interesting idea with some original mechanics but it still feels like just another bland abstract to me but this time with too much inherent luck for a bland abstract.

Get out your snow shovels, ye residents of Hell: Vlaada Chvátil has designed an elegant board game!  The oh-so-elusive hallmark of great game design is a deep, enriching experience with a minimal rules set, and Vlaada has hit that sweet spot with Tash-Kalar (the literal translation of which is "tush-kicking").  Now, merely seeing the box cover can unfortunately leave an unsuspecting gamer with the wrong impression that this is an epic and exciting game of gladiator-like combat between ferocious creatures (and as previously alluded to, the inaccurate first impression is only exacerbated when seeing Vlaada's name on the box).  Okay, I guess that description of the game is thematically accurate, but you might as well just forget about the theme altogether; this is very much an abstract tactical game that will burn the brains of all but the most natural of pattern recognizers.  (Alternatively, you could NOT forget about the theme and replace the boring tokens with awesome minis representing the warriors and creatures, but that would be crazy - crazy AWESOME!!)  And that's where the game is a little disappointing - the board and tokens are dreadfully boring, while in contrast, the card art is all very well done.   As long as a person comes into this game with the right expectations and the mental wherewithal to twist patterns around in their brain, it provides quite an interesting and unique game experience.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Players have two actions per turn to either add a common token to the board/grid, or summon one from a card in hand according to a particular pattern (i.e., it might require 3 common pieces in a row, with the new creature appearing at either end). The most powerful cards require 4-6 existing tokens, several of them already upgraded. Once summoned, the tokens often have one-off abilities to move themselves or other pieces.

An extra wrinkle is that in the normal game, scoring is by fulfilling tasks, such as "have a line of tokens from one corner to another", or "summon at least two creatures in one turn, at least one on red square". Just summoning and killing is not enough; it must be done very specifically.

The result is a brain-burning spatial puzzle requiring consideration of how summonings can feed into one another and into the tasks at hand.

I'm not convinced that it works. Players' cards are drawn randomly, so it is effectively impossible to know precisely what patterns an opponent is going for. Attempting to disrupt them is a total crapshoot. On the other hand, deliberately creating certain patterns is prone to this kind of almost inadvertent destruction. Flares exist as a catch-up mechanism, but if one player has a critical mass of tokens they seem to be fairly likely to be able to out-summon the opponent, creating something of a rich-get-richer situation. While not necessarily a problem, the game is long enough for it to be frustrating. Ultimately, the whole thing feels a little clunky, and I'm not sure the good outweighs the bad.

This is a hard one to comment on. I really like the idea and I am not afraid of the abstract that hides under the theme, but I did not have top-experiences when playing this. 4-player death-match felt chaotic. 2-player high form against someone new to the game felt unbalanced. I guess I need to look out for a 4-player team high form game. I must admit it feels cool when you put a legendary creature on the board. I don't like the idea of the flares (even though I know they are needed for balance).

Simply a masterpiece in the modern era of board gaming. So good I may need to go knock down some of my other 10's down a peg.

To clarify: My feelings for the game apply to the Two-Player High Form version, which is, I believe, what the designer intended as the FULL TRUE version. All other versions (deathmatch, multi-player) are, in my opinion, variants with varying degrees of success. It's as if the designer of chess decided to include a 4-player variant in the box. It certainly doesn't hurt to have it in there, but it holds no candle to the real deal.

Maybe it's just a failure of hype but I feel pretty disappointed by Tash-Kalar. It's just pattern-matching, and there doesn't really seem to be any deep strategy, just a matter of whether you can value your one-of-a-kind cards in the proper way, and much more importantly, whether you can draw them in an order that favors your contingency planning. I would much rather just play Go.

For the right players I'm sure, this will be a great game. Players who like abstract two player games, but want a bit of chaos to stop one from planning too much and keeping the game a bit lighter. Though they would have to accept that the game isn't as simple and elegant as many abstracts.

The movement of the pieces some times fit surprisingly well with the theme, which is fun, but overall the game isn't very thematic. I never had the feeling that I was leading fighters into battle.

For me the spatial analysis of the patterns on the board is slightly too much. I come into the same state of mind as when I play chess - even with the limited foresight. And I would rather do something more lively.

This took me by surprise.  I thought it would feel much dryer than it does.  It's actually a pretty engaging and competitive game.  But, my god, can individual turns take a ridiculously long time.  I don't know if I've played a game with worse downtime.

I prefer the deathmatch style to high form.  The VP cards are a bit goofy and I found fairly antithetical to the theme.

Very good abstract, with light theme. A little chaotic is a common complaint, but with just a few games under my belt (with only the human decks) I'm already learning the patterns and what to play around. Once you learn what your opponent might be doing it becomes more of a 'dodge and weave' strategy game. Taking out patterns that you're afraid of while advancing your own.

RATING: 3.5
I enjoyed this a lot at first. I thought it was a very cool mixture of spatial pattern building, 2 dimensional chess-like combat, and hand management.

Now, not so much. I can never see the patterns on the board. And, while I really want to love the idea of playing opportunistically to make the most tactical advantage out of the game board's state at any given time, in practice I just find this tedious and dry. If I'm tired or want to have a few beers, forget it. It ends up too light and abstract to provide enough meet for me to want to really study the game, but requires too much thought for me to play casually in any kind of effective and/or enjoyable manner.

The theme?... meh. I think I'd like it more if I actually liked the game itself. I like Magic, after all.

Awesome theme on a completely abstract game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating and description is for the 2-player high form only.  I have zero interest in any other iteration of  rules for this game.  

It doesn't really remind me of anything I've played before. One play in, and this is definitely a preliminary rating. Vlaada is a master of putting Ameritrash themes on Euro games, but this is an Ameritrash theme on an abstract game?  

You have three balls to juggle in the game. Successfully complete missions, setting up monster summons, and winning the battles on the board. Trying to serve three masters on two actions per turn is an interesting challenge. Looking forward to hashing this out as a two player only game. 

It plays more like a game from the GIPF series than a game with a summon/arena theme. There are no hit points or attack powers. There is just a capture mechanism.  Once a piece is on the board, there is limited movement on the board.  It is a very neat game,  the theme has a marriage with the rules, but it deviates from past arena type designs.  That is a good thing in my eyes. 

My rating will likely change as I figure this game out more.  I really don't have a firm comparison game to build off of, so it feels like starting at zero.  I'm sure there is strategy, but I don't know how to attack it after game 1.  Hopefully some depth reveals itself to me over multiple plays.  My initial leanings are: the first half of the game focus on summoning quickly to get more pieces out in advantage situations.  Then, focus on the missions in the second half.  Obvious, typcial euro strategy, 1. Build Infrastructure 2. Reorganize resources 3. ??????? 4. Profit.  I'll update this later if this is correct.

It's getting better with repeat play, and a regular opponent.  But seriously, which halfway decent game isn't?

RATING: 2
I got say that I was never meant to be the target audience for [thing=146278][/thing]. I prefer theme with my gaming. Usually Vlaada Chvátil delivers pretty well on this matter, with his euro games with lots of theme built in. But I was aware that Tash wasn't one of these. And I avoid it well for a almost two full years. However, recently a friend bought and asked me to play with him on BGA, to learn the rules better and see the game working. I was... uncertain - not only because of the game itself, but also because he wanted to play while I was at work, and though I can make a move here and there, as I have internet acess all the time, I can't really pay close attention to anything I do, and certainly won't look what the other is doing. However, he was excited and so play we did.

I wish we didn't.

Not only the disconnection between mechanics and real theme was bothersome, I actually found it to hinder gameplay, as some things wasn't clear to me (probably one effect of onlime gaming coupled with learning it). I tried to do a fine showing, and move around pieces, put another ones on the board, move pieces, took out pieces of my friend. It could be a neat thing, but wasn't. What it was was long and, worst, boring. As the game went, he stayed on one side, I stayed on the other, and we both could summon whatever we want with the amount of pieces - what we couldn't do was gaining points by fulfilling the objectives, as when someone was close, with all the stuff either of us could bring, the other pieces were destroyed or moved. Eventually, after lots of back and forth, he won and the game was over. Phew.

The game is basically - do two actions, usually you will either put a common piece somewhere on the board, or you will use a card to summon the creature/thing on it to do something on the board - you will have to have made, first, the proper patterns of pieces in order to allow the summoning. Once the thing do its thing, the piece becomes just another piece, but at the level of the thing you summoned (common, heroic or legendary). In the way we played - High Form - the purpose is to fulfill objectives (positioning pieces in certain ways, destroying pieces, and things like this). The game ends when someone reaches the end of his deck or by reaching an amount of points. Nothing really much difficult, but is has some depth and width.

However, I want to try it again. And we did. Fool me once... It didn't went better, but it was, indeed, shorter. Mainly because I wasn't able to actually do something meaningful and did a lousy play, as the wooden creatures (or whatever is their name) was harder for me to deal with. So, not long, most definitely still boring.

I'm not a fan of abstracts, nor games that require spatial awareness, but most of these are light games, like [thing=16986][/thing], [thing=136280][/thing], and in a less degree, [thing=31481][/thing]. So, by the simple and quick fun, I'm down with playing these. But [thing=146278][/thing] requires more than I'm willing to give it, as I simply can muster enough "want" to play it in the sort of brainy attentive way. I save these for other euros I enjoy a lot more.

So, for me, [thing=146278][/thing] was a complete failure, and I don't want to get near it with a ten-foot pole, as the game might turn it into a piece after I use it to shove the game away.

Way too expensive for what you get in the box, I don't think it plays well with 3 due to the fact that the board changes way too much in between turns. 

The art is gorgeous on the cards though; I'd be curious to play it with 2, and even more curious about the re-release!

Update: I've now seen the new art for the re-release, coupled with the new price point, there is a chance I'll revisit this again. There's just too much coming out these days that if your game stumbles when it first comes out, it's so hard to make a come back.

I love the game but don't appreciate the depiction of women in the unique decks - one is pretty gratuitous and the other has no women at all. Enough to make my wife not play which hurts the replayability of the game. Seems to bring the AP out in some people too.

Need to play this more, especially in 2v2, to see if this should move up.

Update: This just gets deeper with time. By far the best resource system in a spell-slinging game. 2v2 has proved attractive to people who didn't enjoy 1v1 as much.

This is great.  Ridiculous, and (especially with the legendary creatures) very testing of your spatial perception.  The theme (competing in a magical gladiatorial arena) is lampshaded as ridiculous in the manual, and it sometimes feels more like a race to fulfil goals than a 'fight'.  The ability to ruin the opponents plans requires a lot of assumption on what the opponent is aiming for, etc.

RATING: 10
High form 2p mode delivers on its promised playtime and is not chaotic. In this mode the game is a solid 10 and the best game of 2013. However, ap-prone players need not bother. 

Have also played deathmatch 4p despite knowing that the game would most likely be crap in this mode with this many players, it was chaotic and took a looooong time, about 1,5 hours and we even cut it a bit short. This mode was fun but only 7ish rating had this been all. 

The game is very thematic in my opinion and summoning really feels like performing a ritual for summoning beasts. Also the momentum build-up once you start getting your pieces out feels good. At some point you might simply be able to summon with every action and just need to play the right way to get points as the game discourages annihilating your opponents with the clever mechanism in flare cards. Some might say flare cards are a catch-up mechanism, which is partially true. However, the flares are also a mechanism that changes the game into a game about positioning, trade-offs and smart moves instead of being about ruthlessly kicking a decked opponent which would be the result without them.

RATING: 5
An abstract dressed up with a nonsensical theme that did nothing for me.  Has a real runaway leader issue to it, with one player's board domination usually meaning the win.  This is mitigated by the fact that matches are pretty fast.  If this didn't have the Chvatil name on the box, I don't think anybody would have given it a second look.  As is, it's definitely one of his weakest games.

Clever semi-abstract game with Vlaada's humour and panache. In the same vein as semi-abstracts like Kingdom Builder or Tigris and Euphrates, but less dry. The cards provide a tactical element, which lifts it above perfect-information games.

Extremely tense, strategic and remarkably heavy given the playtime. The game changes explosively from turn-to-turn leading to difficult tactical choices, a la Innovation. Brilliant with two, with numerous variants (high form, death match) to add replayability, and the options for multiple faction decks.

Love this one very much. Recommended to fans of Knizia's older work, Innovation, Kingdom Builder and Rosenkonig (another card-driven abstract). Needs several plays to appreciate - depth and skill is becoming apparent after fourth play.

RATING: 2
On my must-buy list going to Essen but decided not to buy it because of very disappointing production values.

Approximately two decks of amazing looking cards, but what the hell were they thinking - a thin, ugly, bare, chess board, and a handful of basic cardboard tokens in a far too large Galaxy Trucker / Space Alert size box - really? Unless a gazillion expansion decks will be released this will be a big box of empty space.

This should have been given a decent, if not the full Matagot-quality, production with a nice board - surely the great illustrator could have made a decent looking board in a couple of extra days - and some plastic miniatures or at least some wooden discs/meeples instead of paper-thin cardboard tokens which you need to place and pick up again and again and again; or it should be in a small Kosmos 2-player box.

-----

Note: The rating is for the 4-player "high form" game only.
Absolutely awful as a 4-player game. An essentially 2-player game turned into a 4-player game through the common "team-play" trick which adds absolutely nothing of value to the gameplay but simply halves your actions/decisions and triples (if not more) the downtime while blindly working together with your partner and with very limited possibility of planning your next actions due to wild board swings. The game may be and probably is much better as a 2-player game but I will certainly NEVER play this as a 4-player "high form" game, again.

Selling it as a 4-player game is practically fraudulent - why not call it 8-player, too, or 16-player, it could not be much worse and at least that would give you more time to do something else between your turns. Buyers would probably be entitled to return it for a full refund as "not fit for purpose".

And that is speaking kindly as an otherwise big Vlaada fan.

Only played the intro game only so far, and I have a hunch that my rating may go up over time.

I am a sucker for semi-abstract games with simple rules that give birth to deep, rich gameplay. This certainly falls into that category, but it might surprise some abstract players how strong the random element dominates. It is not void of strategy, but your main strategy consists of trying to interfere with what the other player(s) may be up to. It also is neither a "light" nor a "heavy" game. It really is unique.

The spatial reasoning is much more difficult than one might imagine (it is easy to overlook a pattern if it is rotated or other pieces are in the empty spaces), but that challenge adds to the challenge and enjoyment.

This is a pretty nifty abstract strategy game. Players lay down a couple of tokens a turn, trying to create patterns which then trigger effects, changing the board and creating opportunities to trigger even more effects.

I have only played this game in standard mode so far, but I am impressed. The theme is compelling, and the artwork is gorgeous. The game is won by completing a given number of tasks that involve matching dynamic patterns across the board, which is an activity that I quite enjoy. This mode can lead to a bit of analysis paralysis, so bring a comic book with you to the table if you are the passive player- there is really no need to plan out your turn in advance, as the other player can (and probably will) completely derail any of your ideas for future patterns.

I don't care how this plays as a two- or three-player game. As a four-player game, this is one of the worst games that I've played in a very long time.  What you have to look forward to: Incredible downtime due to the inability to plan ahead, wasted turns, more downtime, dull scoring opportunities, and few to no legal card plays due to board overcrowding. Finally, thankfully, the game ends and people reel in stunned disbelief.

In the spirit of public service, let me help you decide if you might like Tash-Kalar. To do this, please pick a number - any number.  If your number is higher than my number (click spoiler below), there's a strong chance that you won't like the game.

I can see how objectively this is a good game. The balance of trying to use your summoning cards and trying to score the objectives is a brain burning exercise that I enjoy. It is clever and the randomness is something forces you to change your strategy each game giving the plays a lot of variety.

However, when it is bad... it can be really, punishingly bad. It can feel stressful as you realize how any mistake can lead to a catastrophic implosion of your board position. To exacerbate this, even relatively good plays can be punished by poor draws by you and lucky draws from the opponent. 

So this game gets a lower rating because 1 in 4 plays is so unenjoyable. 

I think I would rather play Tigris and Euphrates when I want this type of back and forth game. Plus T&E scales well to 4 players.

I'm always desperate for good 2-player games, and Tash-Kalar definitely fits the bill!

This is an abstract game, trying to paste a fantasy theme on it(and not doing it in a good way). If you think tic tac toe is a great game, then you'll like this. It's playable as a two player game. Anything more than that is horrible

This is a surprisingly thematic abstract game. I know it's an oxymoron, but it holds true. 

This requires a few games to learn the cards, but then it becomes a very strategic game of cat and mouse. My biggest issue is that most people don't really want to play this with me. It seems daunting for them, and quite frankly, I understand that. The barrier to entry is high, and the learning curve is very steep.

The rulebook choices are pretty poor.  The summary, named "Full Rules" is excellent, and even in a style I might have used; however, they are useless for learning the game, because they lack illustrations.  Don't call something from which you can't learn the game "Full Rules".

The Guidebook has that unfortunate narrative tutorial style [person=789][/person] seems to love, but which is decent (at best) only if you are reading the rules by yourself, with no one around.  There is also this severely unfortunate sentence: "Each player chooses a different deck, but use only two colors of pieces, one complete set for each team."  So much clearer would be: "Each player chooses a different deck; however, each team shares one color of pieces."

Alright, primary gripes out of the way, this is a weird but very cool concept, and I was really getting into it by the end of the first game.  I look forward to playing it some more, and giving people the 5-minute education that will save them nearly an hour in the documentation.

An interesting game that can't quite decide if it's an abstract.

The different races included in the base game have fairly varied feels and the decks are small enough that with a little practice you can memorize their contents well enough to make some reasonable guesses towards long term strategy.  Having said that though, the main content of the game is in the tactics and making the best of the situation at the start of each of your turns.

The catch-up mechanism provided by flares is quite effective, though not annoyingly so, with the secondary effect (in High Form) of punishing a play style focusing on enemy destruction (instead of goal taking).

A brain burner of an abstract. Polyomino meets MtG.

Some really powerful combo's make for devastating attacks and comebacks.

Played Deathmatch, which didn't go down too well with the wife, but High Form seems to be the sweet spot.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]A big disappointment on the quality and durability of the components. The tokens should have been thick, coloured, wooden discs with applied stickers, rather than thin punched out cardboard. The board is likewise a very flimsy, lightweight affair.[/b][/COLOR]

Made my own set [blogpost=28443][/blogpost]

Update:

* Can't wait to get this to the table again

I like Tash-Kalar because it feels innovative and different. It feels abstract but you can see a bit of theme in it. The patterns are explained on the website of the game. 

It does play very smooth. It's very easy to explain and plays quickly. I believe there is enough strategy in the game. You must plan how you'll get the objective cards by using your cards. 

I think it's very hard to recognize the patterns your opponent is making. Especially when there are a lot of tokens on the board. Repeated play might help. Though I don't recognize this as an issue either. 

This is not they type of game were you think many steps ahead, but rather play out of intuition and find synergies between your cards .

My biggest gripe is that it's very expensive and although I got it as a gift, it still should have been priced cheaper. The author, Vlaada, also admitted this was a decision of the publisher and not himself and he also regrets the price tag. 

I still look forward to an expansion that adds more decks to the game.

I like it despite the destroying element, my wife not so much :) But sometimes, it really hurts me when I have to destroy something what my wife tried to accomplish for 5 turns.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

Not sure. The need of flares as catch up mechanics seem to point to imbalance. Have to play more.

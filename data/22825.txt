A very fun and well-produced tactical wargame.  i like the management of the command points to bid for initiative and also to pay for the special cards.  Of course it is a bit of a dice fest, but what good wargame isn't?

A decent game once it finally gets started. But I find the setup to be very fiddly and time-consuming. All in all not a game I'm likely to suggest playing again, but if a friend asks to play it I wouldn't mind a session or two, either.

AWESOME WWII combat game! I really like how this game is modular (different decks) and has quite a multitude of bitz and pieces. The rules need some fine tuning IMO, but otherwise it's both realistic and fun! One thing I really think this is missing is long term campaign!

Played at the Operation Early Bird Demo.  Incredibly fun game.  Great depth of strategic and tactical options, and well thought out rules without tons of complexity or exceptions.  It's really cool to finally see a game that justifies the use of fancy components b/c of actual game play!  I enjoyed getting to customize the soldiers in each squad base by changing out individual units and also adding specialty abilities to a squad.  

I found the game overall to have a lot of fun, fresh ideas: controlling command points, controlling initiative, command card decks, customizable boards, etc.  After playing a game and watching a couple more, seems to have good balance on each side for the scenarios as well.  Lastly, it plays in under two hours, which is a bonus for me.

RATING: 5.5
I think I like this form of game - which is pretty much playing with green army men slathered with dice rolling and positioning - just a more complex Memoir '44. If you're up for that, brace yourself for a rulebook that is terribly long and overly involved. Components are well produced (no surprise there), but the cards are an odd affair - there's little balance in them which is typical for FFG who favors theme over play-tested substance. Not bad, but not great in my estimation. Just over-kill in the end.

RATING: 7
After Memoir'44, for me this was the next logical step to take into the world of wargames, since the two have many similarities. Compared to M44, the rules are more complicated allowing a more realistic wargame experience. I like ToI but I still enjoy M44 more for the following reasons:
1) the squadbases are a real pain to use
2) the rulebook is a bit ambiguous at some places
3) M44 plays quicker
4) M44 looks better

The game is all about squad based tactics and it does it quite well and in great detail. Combat is resolved by dice, where number and values of the dice to win or defend yourself depends on many factors. It needs to be played fairly quickly though to remain fun during play.

RATING: 5
From Reviews: The game looks good that is for sure. The art work on the box made slightly hesitate to ready some cheesy war game. I like M44 and I am sure that this would be a fun game since it is a little more beefy. But if I am going to spend money on a wargame I think I will stick with CoH:AB:R

Tide of Iron was Fantasy Flight's introduction into WWII games.

...and that statement says everything.  I always joke that FFG paid their designers based on the number of chits and cards they used and this one oozes FFG through and through: loads of chits, cards, very cool plastic, a combat system that is, well, FFG (cover dice cancelling attack dice).

This is a WWII tactical game without a real home and audience.  It is too bloated and fiddly to be a proper step up for a Memoir 44 fan.  It is too simple for ASL fans.  Up Front fans won't like the plastic.  Band of Brothers will say it's not that realistic.  Conflict of Heroes fans will say it's too bloated.

The biggest problem with this game is that there are too many offerings on the market, so it truly is a case of "Do we really need another game on the topic?"

RATING: 7.5
Juego de la 2ª Guerra Mundial con montones de miniaturas, componentes muy bonitos y coloridos y un estilo de juego divertido, pero los escenarios oficiales son pésimos. Están tremendamente desequilibrados y con pocas opciones tácticas. Algunos escenarios hechos por fans como 'Blood on the Mountain' comienzan a mostrar el potencial de este juego, pero aún así le bajo la nota por el soporte oficial tan pobre.
Em resumen, no esperes una simulación histórica o un wargame introductorio, sino simplemente un juego bastante divertido.
--------------------------------------------------
WWII game with tons of miniatures, nice colourful components and fun play, but I have to say that the official scenarios are terrible. They're unbalanced and lack tactical choices. Some new custom scenarios like 'Blood on the Mountain' start to show the potential of this game, but I'm downgrading its rating for the poor scenario support.
So all in all, don't expect a simulation wargame nor an introductory wargame in this, but just a very enjoyable game.

ASL without the A, the headaches, the heartburn, and the general misery. So it doesn't have Poles, or Belgians, or Ethiopians, or any number of other minor units. So what?

This game nails the middle ground between a fairly abstract light wargame and your standard hex n counter wargame. It certainly has a lighter feel but doesn't have all the chrome rules that frequently show up in many hex 'n counter games. Getting the little guys into and out of the bases can be a pain in the ass, especially for someone with big fingers. And yes, the variable squad bases don't offer you 100% historical unit mixes but just remember that this game isn't a simulation. It's just a fun mechanic which offers some interesting choices on unit deployment. Nice game with impressive production quality.

Wargame ligerito, aunque más complejo (y mejor en general) que Memoir 44, por ejemplo. Partidas basadas en escenarios, tema sencillo, matar y destruir... :-).

I had a plan to not begin this comment by writing that this is a fun game but I failed. ToI is a step up in complexity from Memoir 44 but it still plays easily in an evening. Being forced to fiddle with an handfull of tiny figures, trying to pin four of them to each squad base reduces my rating of this game a bit. At least when playing with lots of infantry, but maybe the sollution is to simply play scenarios with more tanks instead.

Amazing game.  My wife will not play it with me though, she's just not interested!

For me this game falls into a perfect space in the tradeoff between simulation and game - it contains enough detail to reward tactically sound play, but enough abstraction to avoid excessive bookkeeping and table-gazing.

If you're familiar with Fantasy Flight's production quality and combine that with a lighter tactical wargame in your imagination, you'll have a pretty good idea of what this game is like.

It just doesn't feel right, you can tell the game was designed in a formulaic fashion to appeal to a mass market.  Great wargames are designed as a labor of love, but ToI just doesn't have any heart.  Created by non-wargamers for non-wargamers?

This game has everything I wanted from Advanced Squad Leader minus about 700 pages of rules.  A wonderful tactical WWII game experience.  Plenty of scenarios (when you include user-created ones found on the internet) offer great re-playability right out of the box and future expansions promise an even richer gameplay experience.

There's enough in here to please more traditional war-gamers while still being accessible to the rest of us.  It's a little pricey, and a bit fiddly (the plastic soldiers are neat and nostalgic but are a lil hard to handle) but beyond that it's a near perfect game.

Update:  Slightly lowered this rating after playing one of the tank-heavy scenarios of Days of Fox expansion.  This session revealed that a lack of "facing rules" esp. for tanks is a problem for me as it discourages maneuvering.

An excellent in gameplay and production quality, medium-heavy (rather medium I'd say) complexity squad conflict wargame.

I demo'd this at ComicCon 2007 for the store ALL THINGS FUN.  I run their boardgame night and they asked me to do it.  I really enjoyed the game.  I, generally am not a war game person but I found this game to addictive.  The more I play the more I like.  I found the rules to be very intimidating until I read them. Well written, helpful examples, and a logical progression in the rule made gam play flow nicely.  I will absolutely pick this up for keeps.

Depending on where you are coming from, ToI is either "Advanced Squad Leader Light" or a "Heavy Memior '44". To me, it feels like a miniatures game set on a board. ToI is a bit on the heavy side for my tastes, but it is very well executed and seems to play pretty quickly once you manage to become comfortable with everything that's going on. 

I quite liked the 4 player variant of the game as the social element of gaming is an important aspect of why I enjoy games. There are lots of opportunities for players to work together with their allies and gloat at their opponents making it a fantastic "let's spend the afternoon together playing WW2" sort of game. It's a nice alternative to Axis and Allies or Attack!. It's not something I'd want to bring out on family game night though, it's much to long and heavy for that style of gaming.

Love this game great strategy involved with also luck elements sometime it can feel as if one side as a bad deal and that they are greatly outnumbered and the odds are stacked against them, however in the war context this does work. Some of the rules are a little fiddly not many but the odd ones that can be annoying to remember, if it wasn't for these rules this game would have scored higher still great game and great components (except a few of my soldiers do not fit into the base) the boards are solid wood though (I have 1st edition)

Memoir '44 was too light and abstract while Combat Commander was too random and frustrating (too much lack of control) for me.

This game just tries to do too much. The premises are certainly great, but each layer of chrome it adds just substracts from the strategy and makes it more random.

Good game that makes wargaming accessible to the board/eurogamer masses.  The wargamer will probably still win most games based on their experience with this style of game, but the traditional boardgamer should not be put off by the rules and should understand them all, the important point being the wargamer will have a better time of using the rules and options to better effect than the traditional gamer.  Should be fun for both camps!

I bought this in search of a replacement for my Advanced Squad Leader collection (which I sold).  UPDATE:  I'm a little disappointed.  Not enough of a leap from Memoir 44 towards ASL complexity to adequately satisfy that middle range.  Not enough bang for the many bucks required for purchase.  Also imagine that the figure posts might wear out with extended play.  2ND UPDATE:  TRADED AWAY

I bought this game for a good mate for Christmas 2007. My first 2 plays of the game were quite interesting (we ballsed up the rules in a horrendous fashion) however, I can say that I really enjoy the game. Some of the mechanics are a little less realistic than others, but that comes with the territory. The rules are long winded, but fairly good, even if they are a little confusing. The biggest 'problem' with the game is that it is extremely fiddly and no all the components work they way they are supposed to (the prongs beign too tight for the bases for instance).

As a specific two-player game Tide of Iron only hits the table rarely as our group is usually three or more. The play time is realistic which allows two players to tee up a game at relatively short notice.

A very nice tactical wargame, with as of yet still a couple of flaws: The scenarios are often quite one-sided ( but this is being addressed by an upcoming scenario book!)and it takes a long time to set up the game. At the moment the available options as far as vehicles choices are concerned is quite limited. I hope in future we'll see some expansions focussing on adding to the game's vehicle collection. What is also dearly missing is an Eastern front expansion, but that cannot be held against them, because the game is still relatively new. Once these things have been seen to, I would probably rate it at 8,5 or 9,0 rather than the current 7.5

Rated 8 on components alone and similarity to another game I really enjoy, Crossfire!: WWII Miniatures Rules. It also features pinning/suppression and other elements, but this is an instant kit that's very expandable and I expect I could play Crossfire with the stuff in the Tide of Iron box easily. If it turns out to be a so-so game, we'll still have fun playing Crossfire with the bits! Also, kudos on a great set of board plates: I think they used clipboard material since it's hard as a brick.

RATING: 6.5
After several false starts, I finally was able to play this game right.  The pieces are excellent (although building the squads will destroy them over time).  The scenarios are tense and at surprisingly well balanced due to the asymmetrical winning conditions.

Chief complaint: Offense is too overpowered.  I assume FFG intentionally designed defense to be weak to speed up the game, but it detracts from the enjoyment.

RATING: 6.7
Finding my desire for this game waining.  Its table time is being occupied with COH and Memoir 44.  When I want more depth and have the time Squad Leader is my first look.  Plus I find myself getting aggrivated with the randomness of the bases and how well the figures fit.  It seems trivial and I'm embarrassed to say it annoys me but I shouldn't have to worry about breaking something in the process of playing a game.

After one play... So far, this is a likable WWII tactical combat system. Positive notes: Squad customization. The Overwatch rules, particularly for MGs, are clean. Fairly straightforward, buckets o' dice approach (think A&A Minis)--especially where armor is concerned. Cards bend the rules and offer a lot variety for setting up effective attacks through card/unit capabilties integration. Less positive notes: Two different "point" systems (Activations and Command) to keep track of. Potentially, a lot of different card decks and effects to keep track of and argue over. Eight or so different actions squads and vehicles can perform. Lots of little systems to remember--which makes picking up the game after a hiatus difficult. (In short: fiddly.) While this game covers some ground that Memoir '44 and Combat Commnader don't (or won't), the chief advantages both of those games have over ToI are that their systems are more integrated and cohesive. ToI requires that you learn several different sub-systems for playing the game. By contrast, Combat Commander is thoroughly integrated through the use of Fate decks. Memoir has basic combat and movement systems which only requires the application of modifiers and the play of a single card. Still, the game is fun to play and I'm looking forward to working through the scenarios.

Sorry it's boring. Imbalanced scenarios, two players only. Could have been great with the way the rules are set up and the how units work, and that is why I give it a 4. But the cons ruin the game for me.

In our never ending quest for the perfect squad level game, we finally came across this beauty. I was reluctant at first to wargame hexes with miniatures, but it's turning out quite well. Lacks slightly in a couple areas (hidden units, no facing, etc) but nothing that can't be managed with house rules or as part of the planned Rules update later this year. So far so good.

Tide of Iron is an excellent WWII wargame for me.  It has fantastic looking boards and playing pieces.  It also has a perfect mix of detail and playability.

RATING: 10
This game is perfect, for war-gamer like me, it is obvious will bring a lot of fun   and enjoyment because it's really based on historical background and a lot of details in resolving attack or even defense, various type of unit squads make it very different with other war-games alike.
Several scenarios can be picked and you can determine what kind of game you want to play, either you want to defense while your opponent attacking or vise versa. Even  Newbie who usually plays tactical combat in computer can win over board game experts.

Picked this up in a math trade.  I glanced through the rules and it's just not speaking to me.  Research indicates that it has balance issues (there's a shocker, a Fantasy Flight game with balance issues!??!).  I'm not a fan of WWII games... I'm not sure why I got this to be honest.

Thought I'd like this much more than I did. Maybe it was the scenarios? For a dice-fest I prefer Memoir'44, for a tactical squad level wargame Combat Commander is so much better. Game takes way to long for what it is. Glad I didn't buy a copy. But I'd probably play it again, hence the 4 rating.

Beautiful game engine, fantastic production values, and exactly the rightlevel of complexity.  Terrible, terrible, lazily designed and obviously un-playtested scenarios.  The print scenarios are so bad as to cripple the game, with a couple saviors.

Lo probé por pimera vez en casa de MAr en oct 2010. Es una especie de Memoir'44 para mayores. El reglamento es un poco farragoso, pero una vez que se coge, tieen pinta i doda. Tablero modular, variaos escenarios (y más disponibles en la web). Las unidades muy bonitas y las miniaturas trabajadas. 

Muy recomendable. La lástma es que se tarde tanto.

Love this game despite a few issues. Largest of those is the Elevation/LoS fogginess. the other was the components were not correct when I got them, but the great staff at FFG is correcting that as we speak. This is now moved up into a 9 for me, I loved playing it, talking about it afterwards, and thinking about the next game as soon as we're done. A great game that is, in my non-wargamer mind, a great intro to Wargames tactical thinking.

I really enjoyed this game for its interesting mechanics.  I love the pieces, the board, and the terrain.  I loved the session we played (4 player) even as my team was losing, as everything was just so much fun.  However, the next game (with a different scenario) was a long nightmare.  Verdict?  This game is tremendous, but really, really review a scenario before you play it.  Try to figure out what kind of scenario it is going to be.  If you like wide-open fights, pick a scenario that supports that.  If you like defender-style battles of attrition, then pick one of those.  The game is awesome, really, but each scenario is like a whole different game so be sure to be judicious in your selection.  Cannot wait to play again.   NOTE:  I prefer this over Memoir '44 by a significant margin.  The defense dice mechanic really makes this game work for me.

RATING: 5
This game is a mass of odd contradictions: a core of a good, clean game systems that still manages to be pointy in a number of irritating ways; some decent elements of historicity combined with the outrageously abstract; some authentic-feeling decisions mixed with the completely arbitrary. Like everything FFG does, there are plenty of missed opportunities here - the rules for damaging tanks are strange, the Op Fire rules work but have some issues, and I really miss Squad Leader's range of flavorful leaders (the designer could have learned more from SL/ASL, and given us things like a better, less deterministic Op Fire system, or ASL's great and simple rules for Panzerfaust availability). The game is hugely scenario-dependent, and the scenarios are a decidedly a mixed bag (I've had the best luck with the smaller promo ones from FFG's website).

But, when you get a good scenario, the game is fun. Certainly not a top-shelf game (even though it is in fact on my top shelf, since that's the only place it will fit); it's a touch too attritional and analytical, and not quite dynamic or historically thematic enough for my general tastes in this sort of thing, it should be simpler, and the rulebook is the traditional FFG mess. Tide of Iron isn't putting any pressure on ASLSK. But as a halfway-point game, somewhere between Memoir '44 and ASLSK, it's fun, and I've learned to live with the mess of contradictions the game encompasses. As long as the scenario is good, there is good fun to be found here. I think it competes very favorably with the Lock 'n Load system, and is definitely more entertaining than Combat Commander. Unfortunately, those are not very high bars.

RATING: N/A
Tentative thumbs up after only one (demo) game. Likely to change into a full-fledged thumb....

[update] - "Thumbs up" after eight plays. Simpler and more abstract than my Combat Commander game but still fun to play. I especially like the tactical choice -- and the ramifications thereof -- of "damage" or "suppression" when making a fire attack. Eager to play again....

[update] - Thumb turned near-sideways again; at least for the foreseeable future. Quality components; quality gameplay; but the sparse and (sometimes very) unbalanced scenarios are annoying us to no end. The addition of unit and fortification point values for use in creating home-brew scenarios would be a plus, as would a random scenario generator of some sort -- especially for a system as open-ended as this.

[update] - just received the Days of the Fox expansion. I notice in the credits for this one some different names with regard to scenario design and playtesting. I am thus eager to try out a couple of the Fox scenarios and see if we don't have some meat put back on them bones. :)

Very good game. Nicely done components, and fun to play. I have both this and CC:E, and while I like both, I think TOI will be played more simply because it will appeal to more people. The availability to support 2-4 people is very nice as well.

RATING: 10
This gets my vote as my favorite of all the games I own right now.  I have an unusual passion for WWII history, and now having a game that allows me to recreate some of the best battles and scenarios of the late, post D-Day invasion is really, really awesome.

A well done game - heavy enough to eclispse [gameid=98] in strategy, but not so heavy as to bury you in the detail that is [gameid=243].  Rather, a nice balance between the two that is sure to satisfy nearly everyone that likes a strategic dice-fest.

As many others have said, this game is definitely playable out of the box.  I have a feeling that expansions (such as the Fox coming out later) will add more units, scenarios, and different locales, but won't be necessary to "fix" the game - as it does not need "fixing".

I realize now that that particular quality of a game - that it does not need "fixing" - is akin to how I feel about [gameid=13].  So, therefore, from now on, I wil use the term "Settler" to describe a game that needs no changes, no fixes, and no house rules, to make it better.

Tide of Iron is a "settler" of a game.

EDIT:  08/05/16 - I have such mixed feelings about this game.  I will keep it in my collection forever, for I never know if the opportunity will arise where I will get a chance to play again.  My regular game buddies and my wife are really not into wargames, but I cannot see myself getting rid of this game because it is such a gem.  I refresh myself on the rules on an occasional basis in the hopes that someone says "hey, let's play Tide of Iron."  So I cannot get rid of it, and I really want to play it again because I have never been disappointed.  I have mixed feelings about the rating because I really do always want to play it, despite the well-known limitations to my ABILITY to play it.  It stays a "10", but for different than normal reasons.

RATING: 7
First off, let me preface by saying that I am no wargamer. Memoir '44 and Commands and Colors: Ancients are my only exposure, so take any comments with a grain of salt.

It's only one play, but I was impressed by Tide of Iron. There's a heck of a lot in the box, and, like Memoir '44, the bits are great. Tide of Iron strikes me as an excellent stepping stone for those wanting a bit more complexity in their wargaming compared to M44. 

There's two things I liked in particular about Tide of Iron. First, you can activate your units in any order you want. There's none of this hand management of dealing with a grip of cards that only let you activate your left or center flank. You get to choose.

Second, I like the option of shooting to kill or to pin down an oppposing unit. You can opt for a temporary benefit for movement purposes (they can't fire at you for the turn), or a more permanent removal.

The result is greater nuance and choice in how you go about moving your various units on the map. I'd certainly play this again, but at the same time, I don't think I need to own this. My wife wouldn't play it, and I already struggle with finding an opponent for the only two light wargames I own!

Takes a dump all over MEMOIR '44 and then makes fun of its mother for good measure.  Fantasy Flight Games delivers another future classic- probably the most accessible, immediate squad-level WW2 tactical wargame published to date that finds an almost-perfect middle ground between board game and war game, simulation and playabiltiy, detail and abstraction.  I was really amazed at how much the designers captured in the system in a pretty compact package without drowning the game in obscure rules and minutiae.  The game plays very smoothly and despite a 50 page rulebook (which is very well presented) it's a snap to play and easy to manage without a lot of administration.  The combat system is simple and falls a little more on the abstract side yet it still allows for opportunity fire, combined fire, suppression/disruption, armor, cover, and more- a pretty impressive feat handled with efficiency and smart design.  There aren't many unit types (yet) but FFG's now standard keyword system (a nod to CCGs) works well again and there is plenty of diversity between even the core units, particularly when coupled with a really fun specialization mechanic.  The strategy cards give a nice sense of big picture planning and situational opportunities and although they aren't quite as narrrative as the cards in COMBAT COMMANDER they fill in some of the thematic details very well.  Comparing this game to M44 seems to be the thing to do, but the fact of the matter is that this game allows a huge amount of flexibility and freedom that really demonstrates how gamey and on "rails" M44 really is- not to mention how abstract and shallow that game turns out in the long run.  It's the perfect game for players looking for something like SQUAD LEADER or ASL but more rooted in board games.  The game is complete in the box (unlike BATTLELORE) but future expansions promise more depth, more options, more units, and even more variety to a game that already has those virtues in spades.  A bravura performance for Goodenough, Petersen, and Koniczeska and almost certainly a contender for the best game of 2007.

RATING: 5
I liked some of the ideas and concepts, but was sort of turned off by many others, so this is a mixed bag for me.  It is highly interactive, there is good historical flavor, and the rules overall seem easy enough for a younger gamer to grasp.

On the down side some of the rules just plain seem odd to me.  Certain aspects of the way it handles LOS involving seeing over obstacles are just beyond this veteran tactical gamer, for instance.  I felt that the range and movement of infantry units was to high compared to the tanks, and also that the infantry just had no staying power even if in good cover.

While I'm certainly not going to run out an buy a copy (never mind the high price tag -- justified by the components but not necessarily the game play), I am at this point willing to give it a couple of more tries before I write it off.

(2007-12-21) Played again tonight, and I've decided that I'm just not interested in this game.

This just didn't do it for me.  It is a frustratingly, unbalanced, abstract version of WW2.  It tries really hard to be good, and falls on its face.

Does its job, but doesn't shine so much due to its overall complexity and sloppy mechanics.

RATING: 6.5
The plastic miniatures are not of very good quality.  The trucks all look hump-backed, a lot of the treads on halftracks are bent inward so much they don't seem fixable, the Tiger tanks are a little smaller than the Panzerkampfwagen IVs, the gun barrels on the tanks are almost all bent and seem to resist straightening.  It seems odd to say this, as I looked forward to having miniatures as much as anyone, but counters for the units would have reduced housekeeping considerably.  So far, the only smoke I've seen is generated by engineers and only in their own hex.  (Makes me wonder what the mortar units were thinking when they stocked up ammo.)  The boards look great and are very sturdy.  The plethora of strategy decks is an interesting choice, but one that seems to scream out for some sort of optimization that reduces their number.  

Overall, I'm not very impressed with the game system.  It doesn't seem to reward proper, real-world tactics too terribly much, and "feels" downright clunky and overwrought, for what results have been achieved.

Have recently downgraded this. It's a fine enough game, but there are so many better games out there.  What kind of scale is this? Bad scenario design. All needs a good reference chart. On the plus side, the game moves surprisingly swiftly (if you're not cross-referencing rules points).

Played with a friend a couple of times and enjoyed it. I've been holding off on buying it b/c I know that I just won't make the time to play it with all of the other stuff I have going on. I'm hoping that once my son gets a little older and can handle the tactics, that we'll get it for sessions @home.

RATING: 7
The more I play it, the more I like it.  This is a great tactical shooter which looks great and is a blast to play.  Unlike Memoir 44 the pieces in this really do do what they are supposed to.  Machine gunner pinning people down in the open?  No problem; use a tank to fire into the house.  Still need to pin those men?  Get some mortar rounds down on them.  Varied scenarios (plus plenty online) mean lots of replayablity although there are some balance issues.  Nonetheless,  a cracker, and the best gateway game on the market.

Hands down the biggest disappointment of the year. I hated Memoir '44 (although I like C&C: Ancients, so the system was not the problem), but find ASL far too detailed for my personal tastes. Combat Commander: Europe hit the sweet spot big time, and I would recommend that game over ToI for anyone who wants as realistic a battle experience as most of us would like to get on paper. What are ToI's flaws? Time per scenario is a problem (5 hours is simply too long for the first scenario out of the box), but there are so many other problems - advancing with units is deadly if there's a machine gun nest or two, too deadly, and even if you can lay smoke, you can only lay it in the hex *you are in*, and then it's gone at the start of the next turn. Suppressing fire is more deadly than normal fire, as you only need three successes in a turn to wipe out a unit. The player aids leave out all sorts of useful info (they ignore wire, a major part of the first scenario, completely). Note to the designer: a "round" should be shorter than a "turn", I spent an extra 30 minutes with the rulebook trying to figure that departure from tradition out. In short, a huge mess of a game.

I would not recommend this game to wargamers who thought Memoir '44 was a joke, this is just chapter two. If, however, you liked that game and wanted more, here it is. Literally, as I'm selling my copy after two agonizingly long and dull playings.

An excellent medium-weight scenario-driven wargame that hits the sweet spot for me. The 40+ pages of rules are intuitive and easy to grasp, while allowing for a range of strategies to be employed on the battlefield. I enjoy boardgames for their tactile appeal and Tide of Iron does not disappoint.

RATING: 9.5
Excellent W.W. II-game on squad level; has enough depth without being too complicated with a limited playing time; set up is relatively long, as it is variable and influences succes of play; therefore you should plan during this stage already; replayability is good because of the wide range of scenarios, but even playing the same scenario twice probably will offer two different games; nice components and a bit more appealing game mechanic make that I grant this game a higher ranking than CoH; unfortunately scenarios are often not balanced; prone to AP, but my playing group stays far from it; expansions are not necessary and I think they add too little news, just another setting. Therefore I probably won't purchase them anymore.

Tide of Iron is a good looking WW2 game of tactical combat. While I like it, I do much prefer Memoir'44. Memoir'44 plays faster, is much easier to teach and feels pretty much the same as Tide of Iron. However, this game probably is a better choice if you are into war and realistic details. If you're just looking for a fun war themed game, get Memoir'44 instead.

Tide of Iron is a definite upgrade to Memoir 44.  It adds some interesting details.  And the game weight did not seem as heavy as listed on BGG.

Will be trading away.  Nice idea, but poorly executed.  Scenarios are hardly tested, and frankly the whole figures and bases thing is a big (bad) deal for me.  Normally, I don't get grumpy about this sorta thing, but it really does affect gameplay to have the figures so hard to manipulate...  Combine all that with a very significant play length, and I'd much rather do something else with my time (aka, Combat Commander).

RATING: 9
TIDE OF IRON reune o melhor de dois universos bem distintos: O charme e o apelo de um wargame com MINIATURAS porém com uma mecânica bastante voltada para o universo ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER. 

Não se engane, TOI é um jogo complexo para jogadores que não estão acostumados aos wargames estrangeiros, demanda uma infinidade de partidas para ser aprendido e seus cenários são ambientados em eventos históricos, o que traz um certo desequilibrio na maioria de seus campos de batalha (razão pela qual recomenda-se baixar cenários novos no site ou adquirir as maravilhosas expansões).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played the intro scenario, which, surprisingly, uses most of the game concepts and isn't quite as short as one would think of an "intro" scenario. Retweaked the US reinforcements (i.e. eliminated them altogether) in order to make the scenario more balanced. 

Gameplay is quite simple by conflict simulation standards, but beginning can be AP prone as you figure out how to maneuver your units without them getting blown to bits by the defending Americans in the woods. 

Negatives are the frustration of having to remove the figurines from the bases (I was sure one was going to break in the process--that plastic is not going to hold up). Opp fire is weird, as it only kicks in when a unit *moves*. And I was even lucky enough to have my opponent handle all the setup and teardown. 

An enemy in your unit's LOS can fire at you, and even if you're set to Opp fire, you won't fire back. Another gripe is the unrealistic ability to fire through your own units--there is no fratricide, apparently. Makes it difficult to screen weaker units. Suppressive fire seems almost overpowered compared to normal fire. You can sometimes  ELIMINATE an entire unit through suppressive fire more easily than normal fire. And, even if you fail to eliminate the unit, you'll at least cause them to be out of commission for a turn or two. 

The attrition is excessive as well. No way to really rally troops nor is there really any incentive of having them initiate an organized retreat. It's pretty much just move to the best cover you can find and throw lead down range. Once they get in a position, they're pretty much stuck there for the duration until they're killed. 

In summary, not fun unless you like sending units in to their quick death and chucking tons of dice.

To my shame my very first squad level WW2 wargame. I say to my shame because many years ago i had the chance to become an SL sucker but then i discovered GIRLS!
ToI appeared exactly when i started feeling some WW2 itch so it was a must (hype).
I actually like ToI, feels a bit light but the basics for a good thrilling battle are there (op fire, pinning, routing)...

I bought it because it looked sexy, even though I told myself I don't need to purchase every coffin game by FFG.  After purchase, it sat for about 6 months, unplayed.  I had read the rules, even had it set up to play once, but it didn't do it for me.  Then I got around to playing it.  It was better than what I thought it was going to be.  Still unsure what niche this fills when compared to other tactical WWII games.  More complex than Memoir 44, but less complex than Combat Commander and ASL.  While playing I couldn't help think that I'd rather be playing any of those other games instead.  Will keep it around though.  It looks like something teenagers could really get into.

All in all, I'm disappointed in this one.  The scenarios that I've tried from the book have been so unbalanced as to be--dare I say it?--broken.  Also, there are no starter scenarios in the booklet; you have to go to the website to find them.  That annoys me.  Is there a good game in here?  I think so, but without knowing which scenarios are worth playing, and which are a waste of time, I'd rather not risk my precious gaming opportunities.

RATING: 7
Yet another take on quick tactical combat games with multi-use boards. The use of action points (command points, whatever) is an interesting approach. It certainly puts the pressure on an attacker knowing they have limited actions to achieve their goal. It does feel a little artificial (Really? Those guys are going to sit on thier hands while thier neighbours fire at the enemy right next to us?), but reflects command limitations to some degree. The strategy cards add some extra favour and decision making.
I'm not sure I need yet another similar system, but all power to the makers of pretty figures and boards. :-) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is a great war game. First, it's a great game--can be played in a reasonable amount of time, is competitive, and doesn't take years of study to master. And it's an excellent portrayal of its topic without devolving into a morass of minutiae. To assault a hex the player must suppress the defender, Shermans must use numbers rather than firepower to defeat German tanks, combined arms tactics reward the player. No, it's not ASL, which is a good thing. And it's not Memoir, which is a good thing. And it's not Flames of War, which is a good thing. But it's a bit of all of these, which is a very good thing. This is worth every buck you spend on it.

When it was announced I hoped that this would be the tactical wargame of my dreams.  After one run on the intro scenario the rulebook inspired  questions about various elevations, terrain didn't offer much cover and machine gun ranged attacks seemed overly lethal.  The next play will be critical regarding whether or not this rating goes up or down.

RATING: 9
Called Squad Leader light or Memoir '44 heavy but it actually reminded me more of Panzer Blitz.  Excellent game although I was worried about the longevity of the plastic pieces.  You push the army men into the bases and pull them out again when killed.  They seemed hard to pull out and I worry about the pegs breaking off.  Doesn't mean there is a problem but...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sits in between Memoir'44 and Conflict of Heroes (i.e. more involved than the former, but not as "finescale" as the latter).  Not sure about the "shoot to suppress" versus "shoot to kill" distinction mechanic: think I'd like this better with the CoH chit-pull damage system.  Great modular boards, like the scenario-based approach (even if some might be gamey).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Long set-up time
Lots of rules 

Memoir 44 is slightly faster to set-up and flows more quickly.  Tide of Iron has more rules, more diverse pieces, more control and longer playing time.  The both can be fun for well designed scenarios.

Tide of Iron's intro scenario heavily favors the Americans, and it can be disappointing if two new players play this one, that one discovers in the end that he didn't have a chance.

RATING: 6
The terrain is awesome.  Hadn't realized before playing that there is not just the pre-printed terrain chunks, there are also Memoir-tiles to add.  That makes the terrain from Battletech-era to Awesome-ville.  Set pieces plus variety.  The pre-declaration of Op-fire seems a little gamey, but it really works to make the game interesting.  I guess that's the definition of gamey, innit.  The good one, anyway.  The decks of special power cards are really cool, and the scenario-bonus cards are a nice organizational touch.  

The minis kinda suck though.  Infantry all looks the same except up close, and it is very important to tell the difference between a dude, an officer, and an elite.  And as nice as the tanks are, their very coolness is what will prevent the game from being able to release tons of tank types.  Counters would have worked better.

And it loses a point for having nothing but scenarios.  Yes, Mr Game Designer, I'm sure that you think you can tell people the best way to have fun with your game, but without terrain and force generation rules I get annoyed with your presumptuousness after two or three games and want to play without your help.  The game isn't finished until it can be played forever.  And it doesn't help that some of the scenarios really blow.

Players fight squad level battles during World War II.  Miniatures based game where players take turns to activate units to move, fight, etc across maps that are assembled from modular map boards.  Units are infantry (elite, regular), mortar teams, machine gun teams, officers and vehicles.  Combat is resolved by rolling bunches of dice, with hits being reduced by die rolls representing armour and cover.  Quite a bit of reading to do before you're up and rolling, but it's easy stuff.  The posture of both sides are set with decks of cards that allow you special abilities - nice idea.  Components are a mixed bunch - nice counters, astonishingly thick map boards, annoying miniatures that you have to force/click into bases before playing (I may be going to my A&A minis and play M'44 style before too long).  If you like WWII, dice and plastic, you'll probably like this.  For me, it got old quickly and hit the trade pile.

This is the squad level war game I've wanted for over 30 years. Astounding. If FFG takes this superb system and begins to apply it to other genres... fantasy, science fiction, urban, etc., they could potentially ruin the market for tabletop miniature games.

At my core I am a war gamer and my 25 year journey into the world of miniature gaming was spurred by my search for a combat game that offered squad action without the massive charts and burdensome rules confusions that hex & counter games saddle you with. Tide of Iron delivers in a board game everything miniature games failed to deliver and everything that I'd wanted in a board game.

An amazing product.

Great!  A phenomenal game that improves with every play.  Has a narrow range of appeal -- I doubt there's a lot of people who want something heavier than Memoir '44, but lighter than a traditional hex-and-counter wargame.

Great components, but poorly organized rules. Fun games system despite some weirdnesses, but inexcusably horrible balance issues with the first scenario.

Well, made the mistake and played the first two demo games of this beast. Once you get a handle on all the modifiers, there's a pretty solid game here. Some of the special cards seemed a bit powerful, but I suspect that it was due to the abbreviated play that the demos offer. After heavily playing the C&C series, it was surprisingly refreshing to not have to rely on cards to determine what units to activate. With the struggle for initiative and actions like Op and Suppressive Fire there is lot to think about when it comes to outwitting your opponent. 2  hours per scenario could be an issue, but I won't waste any time painting these minis -- at least not the infantry units. Too much handling for that.

Who would have thought that FFG would design a better wargame than LocknLoad or GMT Games? This is better than Band of Heroes and way better than Combat Commander. Like Band of Heroes, it does away with the artificiality of the card driven mechanism that is Combat Commander. But it goes one better than BoH by doing away with BoH's silly CRT and using dice instead. The main drawback? Almost all the scenarios are unbalanced. :p

Components-wise, of course this game looks great. Just look out for the fiddliness of fitting the figures to the squad bases.

One of my first forays into the world of lighter war gaming, and I have to say this did not impress me. The combat system seems slightly slow and really does not lend itself to a historical theme. I hate how some random squad with no anti tank weapons can take down a Panzer. Makes no sense.If they would at least give a minor explanation then I wouldn't be so upset by this. Also, the missions seem kinda crappy overall.Maybe the expansions fix some rules, but this was just not a game for me or my friends.

Simple realistic rules. Deep tactical thought. Challenging scenarios. Minimized luck. The better tactician will prevail even with some bad dice unlike other games of related theme where three rolls will decide the outcome of battle.
The tanks could be better sculptured especially the Pz IV which looks bigger and widther than the Tiger! Anti-tank units are missing and I wonder why. I hope to see more units in the future like assault and light tanks, armored reccon cars and more panzers. It's not so realistic to use the sdkfz 251 as reccon unit to flash out a nasty bazooka team hiding in a building.

O jogo não é difícil. Ele tem muitas regras mas as ações e conseqüências são bem intuitivas. É um jogo longo, no entanto todos os jogadores participam e tomam decisões importantes quase o tempo todo. Cada turno ocorre 3 fases: Fase da Ação, Fase de Comando e Fase de Situação. 90% do tempo em cada turno é na fase de ação onde cada jogador resolve três ações (unidade ou cartas) alternadamente até que todos resolvam todas as unidades. É fácil. O difícil é lembrar e entender como cada ação e unidades se relacionam entre si mas pela intuitividade, creio eu, isso fica muito mais fácil. Eu confesso que adorei o jogo.

Good design. Captures most of what should be in a wargame with beautiful packaging. It drops in a middle spot I don't want to fill though. If I want an easy game, I'll play Memoir instead. If I want a meatier game, I'll go for CC:E.

A lovely tactical WWII game.  Not too rules heavy but still more meat than Memoir '44.  The production is awesome (typical FFG) and the amount of scenarios and expansions now available are giving this game plenty of options.  A great game that I would play any time.

Lovely game on WW2 which emphasizes more on gaming and simplicity rather than "simulation", but still captures elements of ww2 such as overwatch and combined arms warfare.

The game does rely on a lot of player output especially for scenario generation, but it isn't difficult to do so.

RATING: 6
I'm soooo crossed over this one! ToI is a very good game- very intense, with good narrative. Some of the things that bother some (fiddly bits, imbalanced scenarios) don't bother me as much. But for all my appreciation of the game, here's what troubles me: this is a game that deserves to be played more than once every two years, and I just can't see myself doing that. It's an intense experience and one that requires investment from anyone who plays. ToI is not a simple "pull off the shelf and play" sort of game. It deserves the respect of somebody who is willing to play through all the scenarios several times and get a good feel for the game. But at the end of the day, with two players playing balanced, the game comes down to scenario imbalances, Strategy card luck, and die rolls. Again, I don't have a problem with that, as I love C&C, but the amount of time I am willing to put into that far exceeds that patience and time I have for ToI. Parting ways with ToI feels like one of those breakups where you tell the girl, "it's not you- it's me." This is sort of the case here, except I probably would have had a higher spot in my heart for Toi if it had a better introductory scenario (to introduce fewer concepts), a clearer rulebook, and a smaller time frame. I'm not going to fault the game for all the little niggley rules that cover specialized units, because that's what makes the game a deeper experience. But it bogged down our first play, and while that would clear up after several more plays, again I say that I can't imagine wanting to pull this out more than once every year or so, considering all the other games I enjoy more than this, even those of the same breadth.

So this is one of a few games where I can say, I think it's a solid game; it's just not for me.

RATING: 8
Tentative rating of 7 after two plays.  Finally a tactical squad-based wargame that isn't an eyesore (TOI leaves Lock n' Load in the dust ). Tide of Iron immediately transports you to childhood with it's mini's and into the command room with it's mechanics.  As it stands TOI may not be the deepest of it's genre, but with promised expansions from FFG it's room for growth is exponential.  Having said that, I have only worked my way through two scenarios and can't honestly say I have grasped the game's full potential.  There is still a knee jerk reaction to the strength of the German machine guns, it just doesn't seem fair the damage they can do, especially if entrenched and you have a lowsy shot for a morter specialist, but tactics and strategies will reveal themselves in time.  The ability to build units from the initial draw pool (infantry/officers/etc) allows for a real feel of customized squads, and armies.  This is only enhanced by introducing miniatures over the classic chits.  I am looking forward to a lot more plays of this and diving into the deeper scenarios.  

UPDATE: This is moving up a notch.  TOI is a wonderful squad level design.  After going through the rules memorizing, and unit abilities this game opens itself up to being a fairly strategic game.  Early mistakes in scenarios, that seem hopeless at the onset, help you really learn the values of units, and understand the big picture and strategies more efficiently for the future.  learning curve is moderate, but the game offers a lot of fun.  My only gripe is the warping boards.

RATING: 4
My Rating of ToI was very high right after I played my friends copy a half-dozen times or so:  I love tactical war games and was looking for something lighter to replace my beloved ASL -- which I played almost exclusively for well more than 10 years in the 1980s and 90's.  

Then, Conflict of Heroes came out.
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24800

The contrast between the two games couldn't e more stark.  Compared to CoH, ToI is fiddly, clunky and over-rot.  The scale of ToI is wrong (which was my main complaint even prior to the advent of CoH).  The hexes are so large that you can only get a very small battlefield on your table.  Most of the Scenarios out of the box are on a hex grid that is about 10x15 or even less.  If you simply must have the plastic bits, the ToI is for you.  If not then move over to the new standard: Conflict of Heroes.

RATING: 4.5
I like wargames. I like WW2. Yet somehow, I haven't found this one to be all that enjoyable. It just hasn't clicked with me. Every scenario we've played has been a walkover. I don't like the initiative problem. I don't like the scenario balance. I don't like how pathetic pillboxes are when a Tank is in the scenario. I do really like all the little dice though. It's just fun to throw a horde of dice in the air and see what happens.

Enjoyable WWII tactical wargame.  Beautifully detailed and unique army units for each of two factions, and the maps are equally pleasing to the eye.  Events cards offer great theme with real WWII photos, but can be very swingy in power.  Combat dice mechanic is good, but there are too many caveats for its own good.  I'd definitely like to experience more of the scenarios.

I felt it was somewhat similar to memoir 44, but more advanced, a lot longer to play and not as fun. 
I think I'd rather play something faster or something a bit meatier. This seems to me to be somewherer in between.
The only thing that compels me to want to try it again is that I made such a mess of my poor troops last time around, and I feel I owe them a second chance at glory :)

Fast becoming a favorite of mine.  Modular boards, terrain overlays and customizable units are just a few things that make this playable again and again.  Visually appealing.  The mapboards can be used as field-expedient, armor plating due to their nearly 1/8" thickness.  No warped boards here.  Already, FFG offers a LOT of support for this game including a scenario editor and a growing collection of fan-created scenarios.

It's a simplified tactical game like SL, but clearly trying to imitate Memoir 44.

Ok, after a second play of this game I'm totally turned off.  It
is a pure luck fest in my opinion.  Memoir 44 is much better.

Quality of the component material is terrible.  I guess FF is going to continue the Eagle games legacy.

i) all the map boards were horribly curled/warped right out of the box; is the cardboard too thin?  
ii) the plastic minis are a soft plastic and a couple of the units' pegs broke off trying to get them in the stands

The first turn off for me is the ridiculously long setup time.  After an hour we were still setting things up.  It's really hard to get the minis into the stands.  Maybe they'll loosen over time if the pegs don't break first!  Secondly, because of the warping, units on map borders were literally floating in the air, and pieces were sliding out of position.

Because of the longer length I don't think this game is going to displace Memoir 44 (probably 2 hours a game not including setup).

For a company that has been on the "wait for the second edition list" for some time now, FFG deserves credit for delivering a game that appears well-developed right out-of-the-box. I liked this more than I expected -- it wasn't as fiddly as I had feared, and it's sins (over-produced with all those plastic pieces, too much wristage with opposing die roll resolution rather than a CRT), aren't sins so much as deliberate design choices that make a lot of sense when you look at the target demographic. And even as a grumpy old wargamer I will admit that while counters would be more functional and easier to use, there is a certain splendor to the plastic. The end result is a game I like much more than Combat Commander: Europe and much less than ASL. The greatest disappointment for me is that while the game plays faster than ASL, it isn't an order of magnitude faster ... so if I only have an hour, I'll be sticking with Memoir '44, whereas if I have two I'll be tempeted to set aside an additional half-hour and play ASL rather than Tide of Iron. But I can certainly see how this can be a more appealing and approachable game than ASL (or even an ASL Starter Kit), and I will happily play it with my gaming buddies that don't want to dive into ASL with me. An encouraging product from FFG and it will be interesting to see how the series develops.

Maybe this is the game Memoir'44 pretended to be?
Yes it is and even more, it's halway to ASL ;)
I was surprised how long it actually takes to setup properly a scenario. It also takes some time to learn the rules and all the modifiers when battling. Furthermore you have to take a close look at the soldiers to distinguish normal infantery from elite ones. Even that the rules are complete it takes some time until you are used to certain expressions (note: I am mostly a Eurogamer not Wargamer). But then I like Tide of Iron, it comes very close to the feeling RTS Games did for me on the computer.

Maybe I didn't play it with the right rules.  Maybe I hate FFG.  I don't know.  I played with Dani and Agung once and it was definitely enough for me.  Tanks are nigh invincible, even when completely unsupported by any kind of infantry.  If I want a game that's as finicky as this, I'll play Combat Commander...which is less finicky.  The figures really don't make the difference.

This squad-level WWII land combat game is what you would expect from Fantasy Flight (for those who have played FF's Arkham Horror, Descent, or Runebound). The game board, cards, playing pieces, and various counters are very nice. Furthermore, you get a lot of the aforementioned parts. Plus, I really like the Op Fire rules that allow squads to fire at approaching enemy units; Realism is greatly increased. 
On the downside, reading the 48 pages of rules is like getting through a textbook (not like a Biochemistry textbook, but a textbook none-the-less). The rules-heavy system makes the game quite slow. At times, I wonder if the game lasts longer than the actual battle it represents. With time and experience, I am sure that the game will pick up pace, but it's tough getting to that point. I have hopes that my rating will increase as experience increases.

RATING: 7.5
What is the same are the high production standards that characterize their games.  Tide of Iron is an impressive sight, filled with over two hundred highly detailed miniatures, including regular and elite infantry, machine gun and mortar crews, leaders, tanks, trucks and half-tracks.   Twelve different double-sided boards can be arranged in a large variety of ways, and over two-dozen terrain overlays customize the layouts even further.  The end result is a game that not only presents an attractive picture, but also offers players seemingly infinite potential in terms of possible scenarios and variations.  

Compared to Squad Leader, Tide of Iron is, indeed, easier to understand and play.  But, be warned:  it is still quite a bit beyond the norm in terms of complexity and detail.  There is an abundance of rules to digest and understand.  Even with years of war gaming experience and armed with a well-written set of rules, I was frequently forced to consult the rules during the course of play, which causes the game to bog down and drag.  Only with repeated and regular play will the rules be learned to a sufficient degree to allow games to flow smoothly and quickly.  Tide of Iron is not for the casual gamer.

However, for gamers who are ready to step beyond Axis & Allies and similar games, Tide of Iron offers the next logical step.  It offers a decent degree of combat simulation, yet it is not too complex to overwhelm.  The combat system is fast and fairly easy to understand, and the game is filled with important decisions that test the players’ armchair general skills.  Players are free to implement various strategies and tactics, yet none are foolproof as the uncertainties of combat are fairly represented by the roll of the dice.  Fantasy Flight promises to intensely support the game system with expansions and new scenarios, all in an effort to provide more and more detail and options and prevent the game from growing stale.  That is good news for fans of conflict simulation games, who will find much to like in Tide of Iron.

Decks, Dice, Minis, Terrain types, elevation, command points, historical units. Armour infantry & vehicle, Unit specialisations. All bring the magic in bucket loads.

Pisses all over Memoir, renders it obsolete for grown ups, and reduces it to an introductory conflict game for your little gamers in the making (which I am actually now doing!)

Very similar to M'44 but much more complicated and longer to play for no good reason. 

Combat system is just a joke, with tons of dice rolled for attack and defense with no modifiers. 

For less money, SL, LnL or Combat Commander give you a richer and more entertaining simulation of tactical combat in WWII. Something this game does not deliver at all.

I'm fond of other FFG games such as TI3 or WoW. But this one seems to me as the perfect example of how deceiving a good marketing campaign can be. 

Too much fuss for nothing.

It's a TOY and not just a board game.  But I think it somehow lacks a FUN factor.  If I want a serious WWII wargame, I'll stick to ASL or something substantial and more satisfying.  If I want a game-y game, I'll play something else.  The set-up time may be much too extensive for the level of game it is, although I admit that the pieces are beautiful, if fiddly.  I don't really like the "magic" card mechanism and I don't like it in Memoir '44 either.  The initiative rule and back-and-forth gameplay is brutal.

This is a long, and somewhat heavy game.  I've only played once, but I can't see how the scenario is balanced and worry that the other scenarios will have just as bad of a favoring one side.

UPDATE:  I find the scenarios in the box just plain unbalanced.  That's really too bad, as I had high hopes for it.

Playing this took me straight back to the miniatures games I improvised as a child, and provided about the same amount of fun. Setup time is substantial as is the rulebook, but the system is fundamentally pretty straightforward once you get going. As a squad-level game it emphasises all the right things: staying in cover, the importance of suppressive rather than targeted fire, the influence of officers and the effect of troop training (the 'elite infantry' designation). The only thing missing from the base game is anti-tank guns, meaning that armoured attacks are more effective than they would have been in reality. Good components, but you only get 6 scenarios (and these are mostly so imbalanced as to be unusable) in a £70 game. In spite of that, this is the best boxed wargaming system out there, provided you're not looking for the detailed realism of the Advanced Squad Leader series.

This game's great! Conducting a single battle instead of a war is really fun.

I feel like this game is best played with a cigar, a stick to push pieces around with, and lots of pounding fists on the table and yelling things like, "Dammit, there are just too many of them!"

RATING: 9.5
It's a beautiful thing to see these mapboards covered with little army men and tanks. The rules are solid, making for a reasonable tactical conflict simulation while remaining playable and very, very fun. And yes, the pegs-in-the-hole system can be a PITA, but perseverance will win out. (My own solution: I use a small jeweler's screwdriver to press the soldier's base down onto the peg hole. It can also be used to pry them off again, though that isn't usually necessary.) "Unbalanced" scenarios? If you think so, quit complaining and handicap one side or the other. The game is extremely modifiable. But I suspect that some wargamer-wannabes are giving up too soon rather than discovering the non-obvious tactics that can make the difference between a close game and a rout ....

I love this game. This is really the game that got me hooked in modern board games.  I was looking for Castle Risk (a variation of Risk) and D-Day (world war 2 game from Avalon Hill) for me and my older sons when I found TOI. I have really enjoyed it. I loved the game mechanics and production quality. ToI is a great game, but it does have a heavy war game theme, and so not for every one. I would say that ToI has the perfect amount of complexity for the time invested in the game. Sure, it could be more realistic and give you many more options, but then you must also add in much more play time. No, I like the balance it gives, and it is my WW2 favorite war game right now. The rules flow and make sense. This game is a 10 for me, but not everyone loves the theme and it does not see that much play.

This game gave me most of the experience I would want from playing a tactical WWII miniatures game.  My opponent who is an avid miniatures player said it reminded him of Arc of Fire.  I really think that initiative is quite clever, and the effortless incorporation of airpower and offboard artillery through cards really makes the game clean, and in some ways better than contemporary miniatures rules design.

I was underwhelmed.  I found it to be too fiddly with too many details to keep track of.  I thought it was going to be a short step up from Memoir '44, but it's not.  I was also not impressed withe the scenario we played (I think it was the third one, the one with the Germans defending the pillbox on the mountain) as a good roll by the Americans early, taking out one German machine-gun, made the scenario all but un-winnable for the Germans.

RATING: 8
After 2 plays (rating with a room to improve after further plays - when I'll be able to concentrate more on tactics than on nuances of the rules).

Very solid tactical game.  There is a plenty of possibilities, modes, options, abilities etc.  All this  makes the game richer, but somewhat complicated at first on the other hand.  But once you are familiarized with the rules and the actual gameplay, the game proceeeds very smoothly.  It just needs some practice at the beginning and that might be the deterring factor for some folks.

For me the game is dynamic, full of tension and - what's very important - non-trivial decisions.  Possibilities sometimes create AP.

The setup is no pain (as some claim; just have the bits sorted beforehand!!).  Some concern might come from the fact that some scenarios seem unbalanced.  But that's not problem for me - it's just a challenge to win being in an inferior position.

The only problem I see is that the game is a bit longish (with *every* scenario in the rulebook).  Regular time commitment and a required system immersion are probably an issue too.  And there IS an entry barrier for newcomers...

-----

Having 'Conflict of Heroes' series and 'Tide of Iron' I don't need ANYTHING else regarding II WW tactical combat.  These two are the best options available and considering that II WW tactical games offer more or less the same, the vision is clear: you REALLY don't need any other game on this subject!

I've now seen it. Wow. Very interested. I'll see two games played over the next 2 weeks and am looking forward to it.
Update: I just picked this up for a steal (seriously, a fantastic deal)...I've wanted it for a year.

Previous thoughts based on the pre-release view: 

The production is very good, the idea very solid. The figures are pretty neat and it looks like it'll pay out pretty well.

My only fears out of the gate: 1. putting the figures on the bases may be a pain and may break the figures, but I like the customization of the units and the figure bases also hold chits to remind you of special status or weapons. 2. It's scenario based and will need scenarios for it to survive. I'm leary of scenario only games unless there are a ton (ASL) or have a generation system (Battletech, Battlelore: Call to Arms, Duel of Ages, or Combat Commander)...if you wonder about my worries for not having scenarios for a system, I'll ask you to look at Wizard Kings (a game I really like by-the-way).

Tide of Iron has a very cool production value and the possibility of front expansions really whets my appetite. I will buy this as soon as it's on the shelves <--it took me over a year to get it actually.

What a great WWII game! I liked it just looking at it with the heavy-duty playing board and variety of pieces. This is more SQUAD LEADER than MEMOIR and is a challenge just trying to figure out your set-up, what weapons team's to put together and how to attack. This is a system game you could spend a year straight playing it and nothing else, especially looking at the expansions available. Can't wait to play again.

It's hard not to compare it to two other games I really like, Memoir '44 and Combat Commander: Europe.  This one wants to play in both camps I think, but it fails on both counts.

It's way fiddly, both in terms of mechanics and physically.  Whereas M44 is elegant in its simplicity, this one seems to try to be a serious wargame, so it adds lots of chrome, which I found annoying and not worth the bother.  On the other hand, I feel it's very "unrealistic" (for some vague definition of realism), totally lacking the "narrative" I like from CC:E.

YMMV, of course.

I do like this game!!  It's easy to get into, which draws people in.  The strategies are there for different approaches to each battle.

I am eager to see how this system will expand as far as produced packages as well as the FLOOD of scenarios that will arrive in th near future!  This game will tend to be pulled out quite often!!!!

A very playable and enjoyable wargame.  There have been complaints about the play balance of the scenarios, but those complaints are over done.  The scenarios are assymetric; but that merely means that each side must adopt different tactics.  That makes the scenarios challenging and fun.

For a tactical war game that can be played in a few hours, TIO is tough to beat.

I think the tanks and minis are wonderful.  The rules are clear.  Unfortunately, I hate the game.  Memoir '44 is great--because it is easy to explain and play--it is abstract and admits it.  It makes it a simple game.  Tide of Iron has abstractions, but is a MUCH longer game--and for its complexity, it pales next to regular Squad Leader.  I want to like the game...I just don't.

Enjoyed my games of TOI and found it more than a rehash of other squad-level games already on the market.  The mechanics are often a bit cartoonish and abstract, but they fill their own tactical space and create enough decision making to keep a player interested.

I do find it is a bit too easy to kill infantry (vs. pin them) in the system - the game offers lots of ways to make infantry harder to suppress but few methods for making them harder to kill.  This seems the reverse of the history and also makes it a bit too bloody.

Most of the scenarios could be improved by giving the attacker more command points and/or making it harder for the defender to collect CPs.

Tentative rating. The game is so long and fiddly that it gets boring while at the same time the bucket of dice combat resolution can lead to ridiculous results. I'm not much into tactical wargames but CC:A and CoH do a better job in a shorter time. Rating might go further down.

RATING: 7
I like ToI pretty well, and continue to think about getting the North Africa expansion (and probably will get the new scenario book coming out), but I don't get to play it a whole lot owing to time constraints, bulk, and the fact that it's basically a two-player game. I have some complaints about the pegs/bases issue, but I could probably be less lazy and get a nail or bit to clean the bases out a bit. Consensus is that the base-game scenarios are poor, and my survey, in the ToI entry, indicates that, of those who voted, few thought any of the base-set ones were very good; the better ones tended to be the Web-only ones. The whole firing-for-casualties-vs-suppressive-fire debate isn't that interesting to me; I think it works pretty well. Nor do I care about whether x vehicle carried x-caliber weapon in x year. The Masonite boards are very, very nice (be nice for Manoeuvre!). The LOS never struck me as particularly wonky, although it bothers some. This is a pretty easy-to-learn game, and the rulebook's pretty good although it's Euro-ized, meaning it's easy to read but harder than a case-numbered set of rules to reference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It would have been higher if some of these scenarios were not SO FAR off balance that it can detract from the game. I don't mind when it's a fast game like "Memoir 44" because you can switch sides and get an overall winner. TOI takes a little too long to play for that to happen. All that being said it is still a great game. I love the squad base WW II and all of the options for play in this. It seems to be just the right complexity for me. Not too hard and not too simple. And I'm sorry but minis just add to the game for me. I prefer them over chits.

Hard to rate this one.  I've played one introductory scenrio, which was entertaining, and tightly balanced.  Quite fun, actually.  However, this is not a game you lightly suggest.  There is some encumberance to this game - lots of detail - several bits to wrangle.  I could get immersed in such a system - but I'm not yet immersed, and consider whether I want to.

In many ways this seems like a modern version of Squad Leader.  I love the quality bits.  Love the modular squads.

But as much fun as this was, I don't think I'll be buying this one.  It's just a bit too much of a commitment.

I really enjoyed playing this as a sort of Squad Leader Lite game. I think it's main problem is that it's too much of a toy to wargamers and too much of a wargame to non-wargamers.  Thus it never really took off.  I now own Memoir to play with our 8 year old son and feel like if we progress past that I would go with Conflict of Heroes or Combat Commander or something like that instead.  Doesn't help that this game really isn't supported anymore.  I never cared for the card play in this one but I didn't mind the Infantry Bases as much as many others seem to have.

As usual with FFG´s big-box-game the components are just great. Only the cannons of the tanks are often crooked, what´s a bit pity. But beside this Tide of Iron is a real good wargame. Don´t try Memoir `44 - simply get your ToI-copy instead. This game is the ideal middle of hardcore wargames and just too simplified tactical games like Memoir `44. Some scenario you need to play twice - with changed player sides, because they are far too hard for one side (i.e. you will loose with one side, it´s only a question which player-combination plays it better :) ). That´s somehow realistic but can be very frustrating... and it´s a bit too depending on dice luck for my opinion. A combination of fixed basic attack value and dice-influenced bonus would have been better...

A strange mix of a boardgame and a wargame. It fails on almost every aspect (IMHO).
Dice and cards affect the play too much, your strategy counts almost nothing.
Most of the scenarios are unbalanced. The worst point is that the rules push the outcome of the actions to the contrary of the real war situations.
There is a lot of components in the box but the components are cheap, the soft plastic, above anything else, is horrible.
After so much waiting and so much paying for this game it was a big disapointment.
Sell it and/or burn it.

Edit: played again after some months to give it a second chance... from a BIG disapointment it became a HUGE disapointment... dropped my rating to 3

It is REALLY annoying to attach the soldiers onto their bases to set up the game.  -3 rating points annoying.

Other than that (e.g., if someone set up the game for me every time, and was responsible for removing the dudes from the bases without causing others to fall out), then I'd rate it a 7 -- it's a fun system and so on.  I just never want to play because of the unbelievably annoying setup time.

TOI satisfies my need for a squad level game. My table is a 'Chit' & chart free zone. Some think this game isn't much more complex than M'44.
On 1-10 scale, for me M'44 is a 3 on complexity, and this an 7,,8 with card decks.  Don't need any game more complex than this. If your interested in this game download the manual and judge for yourself. 
Game had its share of + and - . read reviews and comments_ like you should B4 any game purchase.  Pluses outweigh minus for me! Superb  game components !! FFG has channeled game over to 1A Games in 2013.

The next level in complexity compared to Axis and Allies or Memoir '44. Each battle is a 3 or 4 hour affair but the control you have over your troops is complete and you get to move and use everybody each turn. Great fun and fabulous production values. Includes Days of the Fox, Fury of the Bear, Normandy expansions.

The ToI game system is pretty solid. Alternating actions and the command system help to seperate it from other similar games. In some ways this is almost a transitional game, a middle ground really, from lighter war themed games like Memoir '44 to lighter, more traditional Hex 'n Counter wargames like Lock 'n Load, Combat Commander, and the Panzer Grenadier Series.

I only wish that this game had more maps with more urban terrain (an entire city or town mapboard) and had more interesting scenarions. As it stands now the scenarios, while fun, aren't really all to impressive. FFG is promising to expand the system by putting in more Nations involved in the conflict, which is great. Personally i'd like to see them release some scenario packs, or at least throw a couple playtested ones up on their website from time to time.

Main issue I have here is the extremely long setup time in order to play.  The gameplay is solid although I would like to see more options for battling back or defense than is provided although this is better done than it is in Memoir '44.  In many ways, it feels like a slightly deeper and definitely more fiddly Memoir '44.  Its not card driven per se although there are numerous card decks involved in the game which effect your strategy and tactics.  Knowing how much more I prefer Ancients over Memoir; I wonder if I wouldn't prefer Combat Commander over TOI.

Just bought this monster and really anticipating its arrival in the mail. Seems like something right up my alley - easy to grasp, fun to play, lots of little minis and major game pieces that are fun to handle and move.  I hope I'm right.

Update: Solo'ed Tiger Hunt without Op-Fire rules, just to get a feel for the game.  I had a lot of fun. Cant wait to try some of the others, with more of the rules.

Update2:  Have played a couple of beginner scenarios with my friend.  Still fun.  I can see how an unbalanced scenario would be tough to play.

Update3:  Been a few weeks since I played the game.  Tried to sit down to solo one and just couldn't get myself going to set it up. Did the board but couldn't get passed getting the figs and squads set up.  Hopefully this is just a one time problem.

Update4: Haven't played this is quite a long time. Setup time really drags the interest in playing it down.

Once you get around to reading the rather lengthy rulebook, things start to slide into place (gee, kind of like all other FF games...).

2014 Valentine's gift. I really really like this. I think I would not need to get another war game if I bought this, it is basically everything I ever want from wargaming. I wish I had had this as a child and teenager. But then, I would have failed school.

Tactical squad level combat, this is taking control of individuals/squads and is probably the most detail I will ever need in this type of wargame.

The more I play ToI, the less I'm able to make up my mind about it.  On the one hand, it is what it promises to be; an easy-to-play WWII tactical game with great components.  The standardized rules for playing with more than two players are close to brilliant, it has a decent amount of chrome to it, and the strategy card abstracts a lot of the fiddlier aspects of more complex wargames nicely.

On the other hand, I think the game suffers a bit from being TOO modular.  The different nationalities and infantry units are very generic.  Tanks just feel like really powerful infantry units rather than literal fighting machines, and though the modular boards can be rearranged a million different ways, they don't really allow for really distinct maps.  City fighting, for example, is about impossible to replicate with these boards.

All in all, ToI is a good game, but I'm not sure it's a tactical WWII game at all.  Playing it really feels more akin to something like Warhammer 40k than Squad Leader.

Fun and thorough -- as close to real wargaming as I'm ever going to get. I really enjoy it with four players, but the time it takes to roll through a scenario keeps it from hitting the table very often.

RATING: 7
Tide of Iron is currently my favorite game.  With ASL begin so hard to learn for those that do not have or want to spend the time to learn those rules and even the ASLSK series is too daunting for some folks.  Now that ToI is released, the rules are sufficiently simple, the toy factor is high, and the decisions the players need to make can be very difficult.  One issue is the experience needed to really utilize the larger scenarios.  My current game partner and I gave one of the larger scenarios a go and determined that we needed more experience to better utilize our troops before attempting another large game.  Replayability is high do to the AmeriTrash randomization, decisions, and strategy card play.

A wargame lite with nothing to recommend it to anyone who plays miniature war games. On it's own, as a board game, it's fine (assuming you like games where the defender has a strong advantage). Comparatively it's rules are easy to learn, but make for a slow paced game, with little action and heavy dependence on randomisation. Real world tactics do not work as cover is functionally useless, serving mostly as a snare for moving troop stands.

Right now I rank this monstrosity a 3, but maybe I will increase the score after a couple more games. Personally I can think of several Fantasy Flight games which are much better investments for the time: Arkham Horror, Descent, Britannia & Game of Thrones leap into my mind. Frankly I consider this game a waste of money and I'd rather just play Flames of War.

An excellent game!  Takes a long while to setup, but in the end, it's all worth it.  You will also need a lot of room to play this bad boy.

Great contents; lots of high-quality plastic figures, and great cards.  The game could have come with more scenarios, but you can always download more from the FFG site, or buy the new scenario book!

Some people complain that some of the scenarios are unbalanced.  That might be true for some of them, but personally, I think that this does not take away any fun from the game.  If anything, I think it makes the game more interesting, and more challenging.  

With the right strategy, and tactics, every scenario can be beaten, as any side.

ToI plays like a tabletop miniature war-game, but you get everything you need in one box.  For the most part, it is also easier to play, yet still complex in it's own right.  It is a step up from Memoir '44.

I recommend this to any War buff.

Coming from Squad Leader I felt guilt to replace a Wargame with a light game with plastic toy soldiers. Ooh, how wrong was I. Reasonably simplified rules without feeling inferior in it's simplicity. It covers every important aspect what is needed for a realistic squad level tactical wargame without keeping account dozens of insignificant details, like are the troops on C or K rations and such. The things I miss are the lack of hidden movement and ambushes, which I can live with, but the absence of AT guns in the base game is more serious issue. Well, you have to sell those expansions somehow, I guess.

I really do not know what to think of this game.  I know I was disappointed after our playing.  However, I think most of it was the scenario.  The problem that has been bothering me since our play is that there are so many other better ww2 games out there that I do not know why I would pick this game up again.  I do want to try it again to see if my opinion is accurate.

Update:  I played 2 more games and enjoyed the system much more.  It is not really a WW2 game but if you think of it as an abstract boardgame, the system works well.  There are a few gamey things but afterall, it is a game.  Upgrade rating to a 7.

RATING: 8
I've only played this twice, so my '8' rating must be considered tentative, but I enjoyed it.

This is Memoir '44 on steroids: more depth, more realism, more tactics, plus it retains that "toy" feeling that makes it such great eye candy.

I enjoy the combination of gorgeous components and deeper game play. It's long enough to be the main attraction for an evening and short enough to play twice if you start early.

The figures don't always want to stay in the bases, and I wonder if that will be a problem (broken pegs, etc.) I'm also not excited about the long set-up time. This may be an issue for me, but I'm not sure. 

I'm actually feeling tempted to trade this, because I'm not sure I want to store this huge box for a game that I dread setting up. It's definitely not going to hit the table very often. I'm torn. I'm marking it for trade in case a totally juicy offer wanders in my direction, though I wouldn't say I'm eager to get rid of it. It's just that the thought of setting it up and putting it away makes me weary.

This game occupies, shall we say, an unusual niche. It wants to resemble a miniatures game, but it doesn't have that level of fiddliness [i]in its mechanics[/i]. It wants to resemble a toy game, but it doesn't have that kind of accessibility [i]to a casual gamer[/i]. It wants to emulate the wargame, but it doesn't have that kind of depth [i]relative to the necessary time commitment[/i].

I think it's safe to say that my '8' rating comes with a caveat. Let someone else set it up.

Look past the flash on the figures and the drooping barrels on the tanks and there's an honest to gosh tactical wargame here, not just a gussied up family game. Out of the box ToI looks like it's going to be a handful--there's a veritable blizzard of visual vocabulary to absorb with the markers--and set-up time is non-trivial (good component organization is a must) but once you get it all going it flows right along. There's a lot of smart design packed in, particularly in the way the command objectives help define the battlespace and force the player to balance operational commitments with local tactical decisions. The rules get a bit fiddly here and there and raise the occasional eyebrow (such as Rough terrain costing only a single MP for vehicles, even trucks, or the fact that infantry can shoot up a tank but not assault it) but nothing that is truly unforgivable. It gives a pretty honest narrative to boot. I'd been wanting a little plastic army-man game, and after passing up M44 and A&A Minis this is it. Really, what's not to like?

Exactly what I am looking for in a game. An intense, fascinating, thrilling experience - every minute of this long game is important, every move your opponent makes needs to be watched, every move you make is enjoyed (apart from losing units of course). Once the rules are in your head the game keeps moving at a good pace, and the theme generates the story that all good gaming sessions will have. This is not a war game for the clucking historical perfectionists, but one for those who wish to recreate the excitement and adventure of war movies in their own living room. INCOMING!

Very, very good game! A nice, light alternative to the heavier squad-level war games (Advanced Tobruk, Advanced Squad Leader) that still manages to retain the basic feel of those games in terms of tension and decision making. The only quibble I have is that it's hard to get the pieces into the stands (and keep them from falling out). I'm looking forward to the expansions!

3 things make this a hit for me. The biggest is the ability to determine your own distribution of units on the bases, which gives you tremendous flexibility with the same units / scenario. Another is the normal / suppressive fire choice that allows for great tactical play and supported advances. Finally there is the cards and command points, and especially the determination of initiative, that makes for some difficult choices and unexpected surprises. Great replay value and a good game.

RATING: 5
Much better than Memoir 44 as a wargame. Not in the same league as Squad leader but once you get used to the system it moves pretty well. I think that the figures and bases will get on my nerves as they are too fiddly and actually hurt my fingers when removing them. I wonder if they won't last too many plays. Dice rolling works to a certain extent - simpler but less realistic than CRT's and modifiers. Having said that, it's faster to play than most tactical wargames. Map boards are great. It achieves what it is meant to which is a good step above the simplicity of Mem 44.

Revised rating downwards as the irritation of fiddling with the figs and bases and resulting sore fingers drove me to ebay this game.

Got this for Christmas. LOVE IT. Can be complicated at first, but once you get the hang of the system it flows very well and really feels like a tense, brutal battle. Great game.

RATING: 9
Heavier than a Euro, lighter than most serious wargames. Squad based combat and Ameritrash greatness! The production values are stellar... this game is gorgeous!

Update: Downgraded to 9. Too long, too fiddly for the coveted 10. Because it doesn't get played often enough, each time I break it out requires some amount of rules review as well as odd situations that require stopping game flow to hunt down exceptions in the rules. This makes makes introducing TOI to those who aren't equally as geeky as I am pretty difficult.

Is it an amazing game? Yes. But I no longer consider it a 10.

Okay, where does this fall?  More complex than Memoir '44, but less than your typical hex-counter wargame.  Its tactical WWII with plastic and cards.

A totally provisional rating, and an unfair one.  I've only played one 4-player game and had not read the rules prior to play.  That said, all the hallmarks of FFG are here: over-production, tons of plastic, lots of fiddly bits and draw decks, and--surprise, surprise!--a game that fails to grab me.  But you know what?  CC:E didn't either, and I have not given either game enough of a chance.  But until I play again, I'm just fine with M'44 on one end and Flames of War on the other, thanks very much.

I actually enjoyed this one, but it requires a little too much of a time investment for what you get out of it. You could play something like Memoir '44 for the same experience, and it sets up in a fraction of the time. Still, this is the first proper war game I played, and it's a good one.

i usually don't play tactical wargames instead preferring stratigical and operational level games like europe engulfed and bobby lee. but this game is fun with enough depth to keep me interested and involved while at the same time not being overly complicated. also unlke some games that are dependent on a card or a dice roll or a chit pull(not that they are bad), this system allows you to do what you want but not everything you want. it allows you some control so you can blame yourself for things going wrong(or right) and not some card which you have no control over(of course there's always the dice!).

Tide of Iron does a really good job of taking the traditional hex and counter wargame and simplifying it where necessary while adding the customization and looks of the plastic pieces.  The result is a very strategic and fun game.  This is still a fairly complex game that incorporates a lot of the rules and terms from more traditional war games, but it introduces a few new ideas (customizing the squads, for example) that add a lot to the game.  Also, the game plays really well with more than 2 players, which is uncommon for a lot of games like this.

Tide of Iron is a longer game, and there are some confusing parts of the rules, but it's still very good.  The biggest complaint, perhaps, is that the scenarios aren't all balanced very well.  This is usually because of historical considerations, but if you don't like trying to make the best of a tough situation, you won't enjoy most of the scenarios. A very good game that I'd recommend to anyone interested in the light-medium side of wargames.

A simple and intuitive combat system, not terribly realistic, but it gets the idea across well enough without tons of rules.

My son and I played this game for the first time on Father's Day.  What a fantastic Father's Day present.  Haven't had this much fun with a wargame since the 70s and the old Avalon Hill.  My son loves it too.  Great bits, clean rules that are easy to learn but provide lots of tactical possibilities.  This is the perfect step up from Memoir '44, retaining that games attractive minis but bringing in a much more historical feel.  It ain't ASL, but for lots of old AH wargamers, that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Without a doubt my favorite game right now, after several plays just since Sunday.

The boards are nice, but the figs are forgettable and would need painting to compete with the nicer counter-based games (eg. Conflict of Heroes). Having to attach and reattach the infantrymen from the bases to vary force compositions adds a level of fiddliness I could have lived without.

Speaking of fiddliness, the mechanics are fairly fiddly too, and several aspects, such as the cards and initiative points, take up too much time for the limited impact they have.

What caused me to give up on this, however, was the poor balance of the included scenarios. Supposedly, later released ones are better balanced, but the system didn't show enough promise to motivate me to find out if that's true.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Certainly one of the best looking WWII games out there.  It takes a few plays to get the rules down, but overall it is a solid game with outstanding components.  I think I still prefer Memoir 44 for my WWII fix, but I'll give this one a few more turns before I decide for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): The game is rules-wise on a bit heavier side. I'm not too fond with games where you really need to study rules to make sure you're not missing any of them. With my limited experience wargames usually seem to fall into this category. The game itself is ok or even good but it didn't impress me too much. A very similar experience as with Combat Commander: Europe.

Like the game, but it never sees play due to the loooong setup and playtime, where Memoir 44 is alot faster. The box has a minor damage in one of the corners, but nothing that effects the game.

RATING: 4
In a way I like this game and in a way I don't. Tide of Iron can be longer than it merits and the scenarios that come with the game are not balanced or interesting. The small plastic men are a pain in the ass to assemble. When playing you have to do some thinking and make decisions, which is something I like. Decision making, however, is rather straightforward and therefore not as agonising as I would like. In the end this is a very light wargame that does not have that much to offer. However, playing Tide of Iron can be fun. I recommend playing this game with friends while enjoying some beer. I would enjoy the lightness of this game a lot more if it would not take so long to set up and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This has potential to be extraordinately good but it doesn't reach all expectations. Set up takes way too long, soldiers don't slip in the bases and it takes a too long (which means that you don't just switch sides as you do in Memoir).

A fun tactical wargame with excellent components. It takes a long time to play, though I suspect it will get quicker with more experience.

Πάντα θα λέω ναι σε μια παρτίδα tide of iron. Δεν ειναι απλά παιχνίδι, είναι εξομοίωση πολεμικού πεδίου του δευτέρου παγκοσμίου πολέμου.

RATING: 8
One can hardly assess that game without a comparison to other tactical war games settled in WW2. Think of EXTREMELY simplified ASL. Complexity: Like ASL starter kit, Conflict of Heroes, Combat Commander -- BUT it has tanks, miniatures and looks bombastic. These things don't influence game play, but haptics and optics are more appealing, of course. I think, "serious" wargamers usually dislike this piece, as it presents a certain number of features like clunkiness and badly worded rules, a terrible rule book, gaminess. It also doesn't fit the scales, and some rules (especially LOS over plateaus) don't make sense. Many scenarios are totally unbalanced -- which wouldn't be a problem if play time was shorter. But it is long, really long, maybe 5 hours in average; one cannot just switch sides and play the same scenario again. Still, Tide of Iron offers great stuff for players who come from Ameritrash to an occasional consim. I just like this game a lot.

TWEAK: Optional application of a point buy system (see files section)

RATING: 8
Tide of Iron is heavy game with tons of beautiful miniatures, maps and very good instructions. I would rate it somewhere in between Memoir and the LnL series. I did not like the rather flimsy miniature bases that make it hard to fit the miniatures onto the bases - the game would have benefitted more from stand-alone miniatures. Also, by having to pin dozens of miniatures into the bases, the setup time is almost longer than the game itself. Aside from setup time and the squad base design, it's a fun game with a lot of player interaction and great overall design.

After two plays I definitely see the scenario imbalance. To me this is not necessarily a detraction but rather an accurate simulation. Defensive firepower rules the battlefield and certainly turns the tide of any particular battle. An overload of force seems to be required in order to gain any competitive advantage. I have yet to see a very effective use of tactical cards but attribute that to my unfamiliarity with the system.

RATING: 7.5
A game that would see a zillion times more play if I had more 2p play opportunities. The straight-up war theme makes this a dealbreaker for the missus. 

The scenarios are excellent and unbalanced, which I have no issue with at all. I've played through the D-Day scenario box a couple times and that is an outstanding experience.

I feel like the game takes a little more patience than I typically have, as it brutally punishes risk-taking and doesn't really reward you that much. Given the scenarios are all time-based, though, sometimes you just gotta roll boxcars (so to speak). 

The miniatures are excellent, as is the pregame squad assembly. Not persuaded that the extra fiddliness adds real strategic depth, but...maybe? Dunno. I have maybe 50 plays and I never really notice. It seems like there is one "correct" way to build the stands, and anything other than that is unnecessarily risky. Do like the final presentation on the table, feels/looks very war-like. I'll take this over chit stacks any day!

Not a bad war game, but Conflict of Heroes has far less set up time, feels like a deeper tactical game and takes less time to play.  Normally I prefer longer games, but I just don't have time any more to even finish a long game very often, so CoH wins by default by being playable.  Given a whole weekend to game, I would definitely pull out TOI though, as it is different enough to offer a slightly different feel that is somewhat grander in nature.

World War 2 miniatures board game like Memoir'44 with a lavish, yet cool production.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating based on gameplay out of box

Components wise this game is amazing - I painted all my miniatures is just over a week including for 2 of the expansions.

Whilst I cannot fault them for content I feel the rules are a bit of a let down, simply due to some gaps or areas for misinterpretation. They are functional but I feel if I had the time I could probably improve them for my personal use. At the moment I simply have a few house rules written down refering to certain scenarios that seemed unbalanced.

and yes as mentioned by many people some of the scenarios aren't balanced and yes for this type of game one would hope that both players had a fighting chance but having said that, this is 'WAR' so for some scenarios where there is a clear advantage to one side simply give that side too the newer (more inexperienced) players, because all scenarios are winnable by either side if you really want to win them.

This type of game with the nice pieces, thick counters and nice terrain boards may look like an attractive starter set but the game is deeper and more complex than many similar looking games. A lighter ASL as opposed to a slightly more complex Memoir 44

Personally with a little bit of rule adjustment I find this game to be fun and relatively fast paced (ignoring some of the laborious setup times). I am sure I'll be playing it for years to come.

As mentioned at the start the rating is for the 'vanilla' game. With some rules revision and adaptation I could stretch this to an 8.5-9

Although, if FFG could just publish a new full rule book, including all expansions and rule tweaks already noted on their website, regardless if people have all ToI products or not that would probably push this game rating up to a 9 too

And yet another success from FFG's Big Boxes.

I definitely like the equilibrium between tactics and playability. Tactics involved, but not too much to keep it running.

The only thing to complain is the squad bases. The plastic soldiers won't fit into them too well, and if they do, they aren't really easy to pull out. But, maybe I'll fix the bases one day..!

I've only tested the Tiger Hunt scenario as I write this, and I definitely know by now that I like this game. There are of course many exceptions to rules, but they are manageable. Many of them are quite logical.

My thumbs are up!

Had to sell this game because of its size. This is a good game, but with that size - a bit better than average. 

Edit: Just a WWII semi-light wargame I have tried to find... but THE INFANTRY BASES. Oh please... Why can't they a bit easier to handle.

This is one of the best squad level games i have ever played. Takes the best of the Old AH games (like squad leader etc..) and makes it playable for all skill levels. The pieces and maps are very well made and it is just a joy to play. If you like squad level war games, this is a must own.

Very nice components, good concepts. I really like the balance of the units, the way infantry, elite infantry, machine gun crew, mortar crews and vehicles blend together. This game feels much more real than Memoir '44. 
The only down side I can come up with is that the set up time is quite long - so long that I would not bother to prepare the game unless I play 2-3 scenarios that can last up to 1-2 hours each. For now, it seems to be the best WW2 game out there.

RATING: 8
A very good scenario-based wargame that seems to maintain a high degree of authenticity. Doesn't really make it to the table that often due to high degree of complexity and long setup and play times. Also a bit of an issue in that the game is really optimal only for 2 players; the three and four player variants seem kind of tacked on, very similar to the three and four player variants for War of the Ring. Good system and mechanics though, excellent quality and production. I'd like to sit down and play this one more often.

Looks very interesting and appealing - in a typical FFG kind of way.  Sounds similar to, but less restricting and more complicated than, Memoir 44.  As it'll likely cost a fortune, I'm going to be paying close attention to the reviews before going ga-ga over this.

Medium-weight wargame. A game system, really, with options for customization and making your own scenarios.

Plastic minis, lots of dice, WWII and tactical, squad-level wargaming are not generally things I look for in a game, but I still find ToI enjoyable. It's somewhat abstract, but gives you a lot of freedom to make your own plans, without feeling 'gamey'. Lots of little rules, but it's still fairly easy to learn.

ToI is a collection of really great ideas... but that doesn't make it a great game, unfortunately. When playing, making plans and executing them, I often feel the rules aren't giving me options, they're limiting them. It can be a bit of a struggle, waiting for some luck with the dice so you can get somewhere.

There's a lot in here I like: the different scenarios, strategy cards, units.... and yet it doesn't play as well as it should.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This system is just flat out a lot of fun to play and works well as an introduction to heavier war games. The game components are excellent and the amount of components given in just the base game provides potentially limitless possibilities for scenario design. The mechanics are fairly simple and straightforward. The ability to configure your squads exactly the way you want with upgrades and weapons is enjoyable though perhaps unrealistic. Compared to games like Advanced Squad Leader and Combat Commander (or even Conflict of Heroes and Lock n' Load series games), this system is lacking in realism. But for those who are not bothered by that, this system is a gem. Not sure why it didn't get more attention. With the number of expansion released (of which I own all of them), this system has much to offer.

Tide of Iron delivers a medium weight experience a bit more complex in detail and immersive than Memoir, yet without becoming overly encumbered (e.g. Op Fire can be set up for overwatch throughout the game round).

My 100th game acquired!!!! This takes forever to set up. Much easier to get some plastic storage containers for both sides to store all the gear in. Game takes forever to play as well, but there are some very good and interesting decisions to be made. The game isn't really too complex despite the lengthy rule book. The rules could have been shorter if they didn't repeat the same information over and over. Components are awesome. Scenarios I have played have been horribly unbalanced, but who cares... getting your butt kicked is still a blast. All in all, it is a good game, but won't hit the table very often due to time commitments, and the difficulty in getting an opponent. I do find it to be really fun though.

Nikke gave his copy to me some years ago. I don't easily accept a gift so I decided to consider the game to be in loan from Nikke. But now I decided to cave in and make it official.

Shame though that this is possibly the least played game in my collection. The game is too heavy on the strategy and there's a lot of downtime.

Will see if I can get my dad interested in this, since he already likes Axis & Allies and digs WWII.

The game itself is in poor condition. Nikke says that the box was HUGE and by HUGE he means bigger that Starcraft or Horus Heresy which are the typical FFG coffin-size, so the box must have been HUEG. 
Because of this, Nikke threw out the box and wrapped all the pieces on the insert making a nice package. However this package has begun to break and pieces have been falling out.
So now I miss some of the small terrain tiles and cannot completely build every scenario and some cards might be missing. Still, the game is in playable condition.

A total dicefest game. The components look good, the general mood is there, and you have lots to do, but in the end, it boils down to one thing: who's lucky with the dice?
And I think that's a real shame. It would have been a much better game without so many dicerolls.

RATING: 8.5
I have played through most of the scenarios of Tide of Iron first and 2nd version.  Not much difference in the scenarios I thought.

I really like this game.  I play all sorts of war games from grognard monster's to light stuff like Axis and Allies.  This game is a light war game.  More of an introduction to hex and counter war games.  It doesn't have all the heavy rules but has enough to make it a lot of fun.  And the mini's are great.  Not as good as Axis and Allies Mini's but very good.  There is something really cool to be able to touch and move a nice plastic mini.

The New Wave rule book is laid out differently than the original rule book.  I like some things but I don't like that I have to flip back and forth between them.  It was nicer to just have one with a scenario book like in the original.  The New Wave now has 3.  The first one which is an introduction is pretty simple.  Too simple I think.  I think most can handle a little more rules that that one.  So it is kinda worthless IMHO.  The other two are fine but I found if I wanted to learn more about mortar attacks it wasn't in the Rules of Play but in the Tools of War.  Huh?  Most of the combat is in Rules of Play.  Oh well.  More flipping between books.

So I really do like this game a lot and have all the expansions and I am glad I do.  If you are looking for a great light war game this one is great.  But there is one problem with Tide of Iron.

The balance between the forces is really bad.  And I mean really bad.  The Germans never win and always get killed before the end of the turns.  If they do win it would be because of one player not playing it very well and the other player getting great rolls with the dice.  I know, cause I play them solo.  So I am an equal opportunity player for both sides.  

But it is not completely bad because it is very easy once you figure this out to strengthen the Germans and weaken the Americans, if you want.  

I am on to the expansions and I will be keeping an eye on this balance issue.  It will be balanced because I will make it so.  

Have fun, still a great game, but not a 10 because of the balance issue.

I should also note I judge this game based on where it is in the genre of war games.  It is not a monster and it is not heavy, which I love.  So I don't compare it to that.  I judge it based on it's own merits in it's own realm.

Be ready to know TONS of rules to get through a game of this.  If you are willing to do this, then you are rewarded with a rich wargaming "lite" experience.

Not in essence a bad game, reasonable rules, etc. There are some problems, over-fiddly caused by adherence to the game's companies standard formats, a real lack of anything original in the whole thing. However, competent. Its big problem is that it simply doesn't seem to serve any purpose at all - it's obvious comparison is a miniatures game like Flames of War and over-all I can't see any point in playing this over that.

(8/17/07) - Purchased

(8/30/07) - I wish like hell that I could find someone to play this game with me! I bought it back in August and have not found anyone to play it with. It looks to be one of the best games ever just on premise alone!

(12/23/07) - [6] - Tried this one today and I'm disappointed. The level of complexity seems to overwhelm the user instead of enhance the experience. I don't think of myself as a wargamer, so I don't pretend to like pages upon pages of rules. The round-based model seems to really slow things down. Perhaps on a second play I will like it more and increase my rated. Until then, I find myself disappointed in my purchase and mad that I spent so much $$$ on this.

(07/28/08) - [4] - Now that I have acquired a much more diverse range of games, a 6 is no longer an accurate representation of my feelings on Tide of Iron.

(09/21/2014) - [2.5] - Now that I try to adhere to the BGG rating guide more closely, I have determined that Tide of Iron is not deserving of a [4] rating.

(11/02/2016) - SOLD - Tide of Iron made the final trip to Goodwill today. I did not ever foresee a time that I would want to play this again. A long overdue removal from my collection.

I'm relatively new to wargames (Twilight Struggle, Up Front, Hammer of the Scots and lots of M44 are the extent of my experience) but I'm really impressed with Tide of Iron. It really feels like I'm planning actual, tactical level battles. I keep wanting to replay the same senario with different approaches. Definitely in my top ten. Furthermore, I don't see this as a replacement for M44. Memoir still meets a need as a fast, fun wargame I can play with my boys.

Great System / Bad Scenarios.
The System is good. Much more demanding than you would think of a game with plastic toy soldiers. I thinks its two steps away from Memoir weightwise (I am not talking about pounds here). But the scenarios are no good. There could and should be more, they should be more balanced and they are not based on historical engagements (but that's not too important for me personally).
The components border on the brink of a solid 10 if it wasn't for some small problems with the pegs and the holes.
Overall I rate the game 7 because of the scenarios which are disappointing. Concerning the game system (good tactical wargame with a nice flavour of the command system)and the outstanding material it should be somewhere between an 8 and 9.
If you really want to delve into the system the lack of scenarios doesn't weigh too much because there are custom made scenarios available via the publishers HP and supplements seem to improve regarding scenarios (Days of the Fox is a great addition)

Rating based on one play of the Chain of Command scenario.

Well, after reading the rules to this one I was worried that it would fall flat for me. It did, although I admit the game deserves a couple more plays. Problem is I'm not too excited to get it back to the table.

There are games that excite me from the moment the engine starts moving, or at least when I get a few turns in and, for me, this wasn't one of them. There are just too many distractions to keep my suspension of disbelief. Some of these would fade with more plays but many are nits that will probably always pester me.

Maybe when I get some more time I'll list some of my problems.

--Oct2007-- (After one play) looks much like a WW2 skin on Heroscape to me.  Which isn't good.  It has the veneer of a milsim, yet appeared to be missing enough of the "shouldn't it work this way" sort of detail to be more annoying than a game (like Memoir) that doesn't even make the pretense.  I think I'm not in the target demographic.  Still, I should probably read the rules myself before discounting it completely:  folk I respect think it's good!

Smashmouth wargaming.  Not a lot of finesse in the mix here -- hit your opponent hard up the middle and hope for the best.  There's room for strategy, but you damn well better be going in head-first or you're a gonner.

The pieces and their bases just aren't made for someone with hands the size of mine.  An interesting concept not well executed.

I enjoyed it very much. The FFG site has additional scenarios, including learning ones. I think the "unbalanced" comments are by those who haven't mastered the game well enough -- some sides are easier to *play* than others. (Hint: Give the n00b the machine gun nests!) Setup time *can* be long, not because of the bits, but because, like any true wargame, how you group and deploy your forces before the game even begins is as important as playing the game itself (sorta like Settlers of Cataan!). The base game also comes with enough modular boarda and other bits for you to make your own scenarios.

Not really a fan of WWII games, unless they're really good. And Tide of Iron is a fairly nice one, with minis deluxe and quite a lot of interesting tactical opportunities.

It's easier to pick up and pretty much gives the same fix.

RATING: 6
Visual Appeal: (5)
This game is better looking than most single-box miniatures games I've seen (i.e. the similar Memoir 44). I was a huge fan of the Panzer General II video game by SSI Interactive. This gave me the same visual feel that I was looking for in a hex based tactical game.

Components: (5)
The pieces are totally paint-able, and many people have done so. I have no skill in that department, but luckily they look good even in flat colors. The bases for infantry are nice because you can switch up your mortar and mg squads and they hold on to any specialization tokens for you. dice and cards that come with the game have no issues. All are good usual FFG pieces.

Theme: (4)
There are a good number of different scenarios for this game and they are set believably. I don't know how many if any are based on actual engagements. It does seem like the American team often outnumbers the German team though. In some cases, I couldn't even see how it was possible for the Germans not to be completely crushed. Even if this is true in a particular historical engagement (which again, I am no war history buff so I don't know), there should be more balance to some scenarios.

Learning: (2)
This is where the game really bites it for me. I just can't remember all the rules necessary to play a game like this without stopping to check every round. That adds non-game stress to the game for me and is a real detriment to the flow of play. The games are already long, so you have a lot of time to pick up on things you miss in the first few rounds if you're just learning. I have not tried to teach anyone this game. I don't know if I would feel confident doing it. My brain is wired to understand different styles of game but this game gets me all turned around sometimes.

Gameplay: (3)
The interaction is done like most tactical games with dice. There are also cards that each player can use to augment their battlefield strategies in some way. These have little effect on remedying bad rolls though. Such is the nature of dice! Not always my cup of tea, but in this game it seems particularly unforgiving. Got in the wrong place or got out maneuvered? Well, you can say goodbye to defending that area. Sometimes it feels like losing 1 MG or 1 tank at a crucial place will cost you the game. At best you have to tough it out and hope things swing back in your favor.

Overall Fun: (3)
It's not for me. That's really what it will come down to. I feel like the 3 maps we played were unfairly advantaged to the American side (and I have played both sides). The dice have a way of making you feel incompetent. One brilliant maneuver can be your doom if your advantage of position doesn't also play out in the dice. I'd like to try again on the remaining maps or maybe some user created ones that address more equal deployment strengths. It is a game I want so badly to like that it can have a second and maybe third chance from me.

Very intuitive and easy to play hexen tactical wargame about World War II.  Nevertheless, perhaps it is just too much for what it delivers.  Besides, some components are awful and don't work properly: the soldiers don't fit in the bases and the dice are a joke.  Still OK, but I don't see the ocasion in which I'd prefer to play this one over [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=1]BattleLore[/url][/i] or [i]Memoir '44[/i], which bring similar feelings to the table.

I like everything about this game but... takes too long to set up & I HATE the "counters". Too bad. IMHO there's nothing about this system that COH doesn't do better.

The mechanics of this game are great, as are the bits.  The core rules are  intuitive and there are several additional parts that spice up the game (like command points, optional cards and the like).  There is a lot of opportunity for deep strategic and tactical play in a wargame that does not require looking up rules often.

Good game. Would have to play a more interactive scenario, as the idea of any kind of Attack and Defend scenario bores the beegezus out of me. It's a well designed game, but my low interest in war games detracts from my liking. Also, feels like an 1.5 hours game stretched into 3 hours. Hopefully different scenarios and shortened play time will make it more interesting.

Pre-payed for mine Dec. 26, 2006 a Update: I finally got my copy on June 29, 2007.
 Played a few times and I find it a dcent squad level game with some very interesting ideas, but ultimatly, I think the set up time wil keep it off the table. That is too bad as the variable boards, ability to change squad compositions and various scenarios give this all kinds of replay possibilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In my opinion the rules in TOI governing gaining and keeping initiative, gaining command points, the purchase and the use of the combinations of the multiple Strategy card decks, all the stuff that you need to think about that is not on map, are game sub-systems that detract from the immersiveness of the combat portion of the game. 

These game sub-systems feel like an unneccessarily complex set of processes designed to distract the player from the fact that this is just as big of a dicefest as Memoir '44 and takes it three or four times as long to play.

It's interesting in that you study trade-offs between actions and firepower (concentrated fire versus supporting fire), normal and suppressive fire etc, but the long, fiddly setup (@#$# squad bases) is scary. I don't mind long setups if it's for a single 3-hour game or more, but with ToI, you take an hour to set up a scenario, play it for 1-2 hours, then take another hour to set up another scenario... very low returns for the high overhead here. 

As for the mechanisms themselves, I had been looking for something between Memoir '44 and Conflict of Heroes on the complexity scale (preferably with plastic figurines) to hook my non-gaming WW2 friends, but turns out ToI is arguably harder to teach than CoH! CoH is definitely a cleaner design (compare the lengths of the rulebooks), and is nowhere near as fiddly, both in rules and in setup.

I haven't played this game that many times. It's very pretty and it shows a lot of promise - unfortunately promise is about all it has shown thus far. It might just be that the scenarios I've tried thus far aren't that good, I'm honestly not sure. Maybe this one will grow on me, but as it stands, I'd rather play Memoir '44 when in the mood for something light, or a proper hex-and-counter wargame when in the mood for something heavier.

I've only played the preview scenario, but it was a lot of fun.  I would be interested in playing again, although it is not likely that I will ever purchase a copy for myself.  It is a lot like Memoir '44, but you do have a lot more control over what goes on.  Of course, the trade-off is greater complexity.  It took us a little while to get the system down, but once we did, everything seemed to flow pretty easily / intuitively.  Biggest problem was needing to refer to the player aid sheets a fair amount (three of them) that would likely be reduced with more playing. 2/25/2007

Almost perfect mix of realism and ease of gameplay. Beautiful components, miniatures and ruleset with great variability for scenario design and replayability. 

The rules are not as difficult to get into as it might seem. The official scenarios are generally not well thought out. Buy the designer series scenario book or design your own.

Ideal for WW2 buffs that want the feel of the era and some though tactical decision making but don't have days to spend looking at ugly card counters.

It arrived today (4 June) and whew, great components and quality all round. The mapboards are standouts (thick chipboard!) and other companies should take a leaf out of FFG's book. Only gripe is that the game could easily have fit into the FFG square box range (something like the Doom box would suit and leave enough space for an expansion or two). As it stands, I'd say that the box is 50% air.

It is very successfull in creating a "bubble", a small world of its own. Some basic strategy principles are not very well represented but still it's fine. The bad things are the long setup time and a lack of good scenarios to use the full potential of the game. It needs support from the gamers, the company doesn't seem capable of developing and publishing decent scenarios for it. If it receives the necessary support it can be a really fun game.

Solid lightweight squad based war game, which is fun to play. The rules work pretty well except in a few occasions. For example it seems strange that morale can only be affected with suppressive fire. One would think that killing half of a squad would do something to morale.

The map boards are very thick and are easily the best I have ever seen in a war game. The system of attaching your troops to the base is clever enough, but in this aspect the quality feels a bit cheap. The tank molds are nice enough. And honestly I think this game could have been fitted in a smaller box (War of the Ring size).

Tide of Iron compares to other WWII games, as Call of Duty compares to other WWII shooters: It looks great, plays nice, is very popular, but other games convey a more tense gaming experience on the same topic (which is WWII tactical games).

RATING: 6.5
It's ok.  The problem with the game is that it is long.  Now I'm not opposed to long games, but this game runs far longer than it merits.  I'm not sure why I would ever chose to play this when there are superior longer war games to chose from.  For the level of time commitment, for a hexbased tactical game I'd rather be playing Eastfront, Rommel in the Desert or Bobby Lee.  For such a light tactical squad level game, Combat Commander is just quicker and more fluid whereas this feels so turgid.  I didn't feel like there was much of a narrative here, and I don't feel that a defender's situation that they have much to do that is all that exciting.  More scenarios should reveal potential depth.

I guess what this has going for it is that it has cool little plastic men, but they are a total pain in the ass, and it is hard to differentiate them all especially the experienced soldiers and the green scrubs.  Counters or blocks are just superior in clarity, and aren't as liable to break the way that these are.  Was nothing learned from Broadsides?  

With that said, it is a fine game. It is enjoyable and never did I feel that there was anything wrong with it.  This feels complete and shouldn't rely on an expansion to fix it.  With more experience it should be a little quicker, and with more experience knowing troop capability should increase the level of real game.  If inspired to play this again, my rating may go up marginally, but for how light it is, I suspect I'd rather just play BattleLore.

Loads of fun. Takes some time to set up but honestly the setup time is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be after reading so many complaints about it online. I've mentioned several times before that a good game is one that is a series of interesting decisions and this game had that in spades. I'm a sucker for lots of little plastic bits too so this scores high just for that. This is a game where despite the dice rolling I feel like when I lose I can look over what happened and pick out exactly where I went wrong and how I could do better next time. Which just makes me want to play it more. I just wish I knew more people who are willing to put in the time to learn and play this with me!

A bit complex in comparison to my other games. I see why many would prefer Memoir '44 to Tide of Iron. I feel there are way too many exceptions and would prefer a slightly lighter game, but also one that emphasizes the Find, Fix, Flank, Finish tactics in World War II. Keeping track of individual unit stats, cards, cover, etc. tend to bog things down. At the same time, Memoir '44 is too simple and luck driven, which I DON'T prefer over ToI.

Fun, and fairly realistic.  A unique monstrosity. If you like dice and chits and minis, this is your game.

Really enjoy this game. It's not as deep and studious as the old Avalon Hill wargames but it's a great mix between abstraction and simulation. While simple, the general combined arms idea of 'find em, fix em, flank em,finish em' works as it should in this game. A good gateway for friends that might otherwise be put off by the complexity of traditional wargames. Only bad point is that a lot of the scenarios are badly imbalanced.

Very nice war game, lots of tactics involved. I like the complexity and options you have each turn. There is very little down time as your troops can take actions even when it's not your turn, and you've got to adjust your tactics along the way.

Requires patience and can take time to set up. Scenarios I found online are very good and bring lots of re-playability to the game.

Game has lots of great plastic components. Some look similar but we had no trouble distinguishing them.

Rules are a bit complex and rulebook is not so well organized, better to learn while playing it with somebody who knows all the rules.
Took me about 5 games to really learn all the rules after reading the rulebook, and took about 3 games to teach a non-war gamer all the rules.

I wish the scenarios that come with the game were a bit more balanced.

Impressions after 2 plays:

Depending on where you are coming from, ToI is either "Advanced Squad Leader Light" or a "Heavy Memior '44". To me, it feels like a miniatures game set on a board. I haven't played the game enough to get into particulars, but at the moment it's definitely my favorite WW2 game, and probably my favorite "tactical level" game (although I do really enjoy the C&C series as well). ToI is a rules heavy game, something I don't tend to enjoy that much, but it is very well executed and seems to play pretty quickly once you manage to become comfortable with everything that's going on. 

I quite liked the 4 player variant of the game as the social element of gaming is an important aspect of why I enjoy games. There are lots of opportunities for players to work together with their allies and gloat at their opponents making it a fantastic "let's spend the afternoon together playing WW2" sort of game. It's a nice alternative to Axis and Allies or Attack!. It's not something I'd want to bring out on family game night though, it's much to long and heavy for that style of gaming.

TOI is a tactical game of chance, where the players can duke it out Band of Brothers style on the WWII battlefields of Europe. I wanted the game since I read the rules in the online manual, describing a game of simplicity yet great diversity. I bought it as soon as it hit a store nearby and after playing three very interesting battles, it left me wanting more. The things I like so far:- The contents of the box is of excellent quality. Appearantly this is what FF Games is famous for and this box definately confirms it. The board, the overlays and markers, the cards and the units look beautiful.- The game is a toolbox game, which means that FF created the possibility for endless scenarios and army configurations. Excellent.- The rules are a real treat. The combat rules are based on an underlying system, which if memorised, makes all specific rules logical and easy to remember. The command system makes the game more exciting, as you must balance initiative and bonus effects.I've had a lot of fun with this game so far and I reckon I'll have a lot more to come! ^_^

Although you roll dice all the time, the luck factor seems not to be all that important in this game. The components are top-notch, and it has tactics as well as strategy galore. The command-points system is exciting. Though some have complained about the lack of balanced scenarios (and there really is an issue), here's hoping that some better ones are in the pipeline.

Solid, but perhaps too much work for the amount of enjoyment derived from it. Memoir '44 provides us with the same enjoyment with less effort (and less table space required).

I really want to get something from this game though, as I have always been a bit of a WWII nut. I will not give up on it before finding someone willing to dedicate some time to it so that we can really get to know it.

RATING: N/A
Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.
Tide of Iron is a Scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.
The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations. The only limiting factor is your imagination!

Okay, I've finally gotten back into this, and I'm enjoying it greatly.  I knocked its rating down a bit after getting into Panzer Grenadier, but now I'm glad I also have a small scale war game with high attrition and awesome miniatures.

After going down the hex and counter road, though it's sometimes necessary to allow certain "non-simulation" aspects to be, like mortars and MGs damaging tanks. (actually, I'm not quite okay with MGs vs tanks, and houserule it)

RATING: 8
If it wasn't for the set-up time I'm convinced this would hit the table at my local club more times than it has since its release. Whenever we play we always seem to end up having to call it a night just as the action starts to get inetersting - we need to prep the units beforehand!!
It's always a very good experience whenever it does get gaming time but we tend to play infrequently which only compounds the game time as we have to constantly refer to the RB (argh - not my favourite compenent). I want to rate this higher and probably could if only we played it more. 
If ever there is the option to play on-line (yes I am a Vassal fan) I'm sure that want will become a reality.

Cool Ameritrash war game, but the pieces are great, the boards are highly changeable, and the squad level play is cool.  the dice that came with the game are small, and cheapened the overall feel, so I purchased some standard sized six sided dice to enhance the game.

TOI is fantastic. I am an old school wargamer and have seen many of them. TOI is so much simpler to play but still forces accurate tactics. To me this is Squad Leader light.

Played twice so far; an introductionary scenario which was kind of static, and the first scenario in the book, in which I was blown away by handfulls of sixes.
Don't know what to think now, it was like CC:E without any tension but dependant on dice-luck. Of course I did some stupid things without which I'd survived the first blows, so I hope to play this again soon.

Third play sept'09, where the ongoing machinegun firing throughout the whole board started to annoy me. I've promised to play ToI at least once more, but to be honest my enthusiasm is fading; too dicey and strangely (not so) balanced arms. The lines of sight are odd, to say the least.

Fourth play with a massive amount of tanks. The first turn dragged on and it occurred to me that the game suggests simultanious actions (every unit moves once in each turn) but once a unit has been moved it can become sitting duck for the rest of the turn. The rating remains a 6 but I don't think I'll play this again, soon.

Huuuge dissapointment. 

I'm not an extremist in gaming. 
I accept different systems and mechanics in games.

I do like Memoir 44 as a light game as I like Combat Commader as a very random game as I like ASL as an Analysis Paralysis game.

They all have their merits why I agree to play and enjoy them.

But this is different. Extrme simplistic rules with a "glued on" addition of cards to bring "replayability" packed with a milloin tons of whistles and bells.

Once you strip off all the "bling" you'll find close to nothing is left. And that what's left is quite ugly.

Already when reading the rules I felt baffled. 

Many of the rules felt stupid. Absolute loathed the division of shooting into suppressive and normal and how they work.

Setup is a drag, and not worth the actual playing "experience".

I belive this is the second game in my entire life that we quit in the middle because it sucked badly. 

Was a painful experience. No immersion. No fun. 
Spend your money on something more useful.

The game is a completely different system, but I can't help comparing it to [gameid=10630].  This fast-paced, mid-scale WWII game is very reminiscent of Memoir, down to the hex overlays and slow attrition of the little plastic dudes.  The victory conditions are more satisfactory than eliminating units in Memoir, but it loses some of the simplicity.  I found it difficult to internalize the effects of cover, fire, and fatigue.  After a couple plays, I got it, but I think those rules make it harder for people to pick the game up quickly.  Still, it's a good game in its own right.  I don't know that I'll ever plunk down the cash to own it, but I'll play it if somebody else has it and suggests it.

RATING: 6
Tide of Iron features a Fantasy Flight staple, giant piles of plastic figures. This time it's the machine gun nests and Panzer tanks of WWII. Overall, these are nice little toy soldiers. The map tiles are heavy duty and quite nice, designed for use in many different scenario configurations. My only issue with the components are the infantry bases. The game requires you to build custom squads using multiple figures (up to four per base), and getting the little feet of the toy soldiers into the holes in the teeny-tiny bases is tedious at best, not to mention the 20 extra minutes it adds to set up time. Maybe I am just uncoordinated or too scared to break them, but set-up drives me crazy.

The game does a great job of presenting a typical WWII battle. Entrenched machine guns are deadly, tanks are mobile and devastating, and a well placed mortar can pin down multiple infantry units. There are a ton of cool mechanisms (particularly Op fire and suppression fire) that are rarely done in lighter wargames and Tide of Iron utilizes them wonderfully. The limited actions per turn, as well as the aforementioned fire modes make for a ton of interesting decisions. I'm not a huge fan of the card play, as the command deck is not all that intuitive. I often find it hard to know what deck to draw from, when given a choice. This probably becomes more clear with multiple plays, but I still feel that I am playing blind when it comes to that aspect of the game.

My main gripe however, are the scenarios. Not only is there no system for creating custom scenarios, the ones provided do not seem to be terribly balanced. Often times it seems to lean on making one player an entrenched defender, who does nothing but op-fire every round while the attacker usually has superior numbers to throw against the wall of lead, in a mad rush to beat the time limit of the scenario. Essentially, one player tries to solve the puzzle of a safe advance, while the other player simply tries not to die. Strategically, I'm not sure these scenarios make the best use of the game's mechanisms. It's a frustrating feeling, as it seems like the framework of this game is among the best out there, yet when I play...it all feels like lost potential.

Another drawback is that this is another game with a big set-up time, yet it only handles two players. (We tried three once, it was terrible. It felt like I was playing the whole game with one hand tied behind my back!) This makes it very difficult to squeeze in when our game group gets together. Still, the scenarios in the newer expansions seem to be much more promising, so this is one that I will probably keep around for a while.

Long after I punched a million chits, years after I obsessively bagged everything for easy sorting and game play, eons after I pushed this game onto my game room's top shelf after a single play, I'm ready to admit that [b][i]Tide of Iron[/i][/b] just ain't my thing and move it on to somebody else's house.

I've never been one for war games – or historical scenarios of any stripe, really – so I shouldn't be surprised by my indifference to this game, only by my reluctance to move this thing out of the house sooner. Know thyself, and all that jazz.

RATING: 9
I think this could be regarded as my 1st really grognardy wargame, although the little plastic bits sortov give it the feel of a more "toyee" style battlelore or battlecryesque game, the componants are of the now usual FFG high quality and teh rule book (though pretty hefty) is well layed out. The rules are pretty easy to remember, though can be rather confusing upon only one reading of the rule book, As in any game upon a 1st playing mistakes were made and things forgotten but upon subsequent playings I think I can now pretty mmuch play form the useful sheet thing alone. I am keenly awaiting  the release of the british expansion. The onl;y reason i gave this a 9 instead of a 10 is that it does take a considerable time to play, in the time I could play 6 or 7 games of battlelore/battlecry I coudl play one game of this, and that would be one of the smaller scenarios too! Still a very worthy purchase and I advise anyone wanting to get into hard core grognardy wargames to try this as an entry  to them.

Not the kind of game I normally seek out, but very good. I would play with the right players time and again. It is not a game I'd suggest to just anyone, it is not a general-interest game. Some of the figures in the first set I had a chance to review were disfigured and poorly cast, but most of them were in good shape.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
OK, despite the Grrr, Wa Wa WA WOW Wow Wow Wow, Woof factor I'm revising my rating down a bit on this one.  It's probably the closest anything has come to a fabled Squad Leader lite though given the limited unit mix I'd call it SL Ultra Lite.  I don't care for the minis but they're functional and what would be expected without making the game cost a fortune.  All my AA:minis look good on this game.  It's got good solid rules and a decent number of scenarios with more being posted to the FFG website already. Superior quality game boards (very thick)!  Makes me feel like a kid again playing with toy soldiers, only this time with structured rules and verified results (no more "I shot your bazooka guy, no you didn't he stepped on my land mine hidden there", etc.).  

But I can't help but feel this is what AA:Minis would be if it wasn't a collectible game.  The rules for ToI aren't much more complex than AA:M, and with the upcoming Expert rules for the latter, it will surpass this game in complexity.  But the non-collectible aspect and set piece scenarios give this game excellent appeal. Expect to see alot of expansion packs for this however with new units and scenarios.

As usual, fantasy flight's rule book is not well written. However, once the game and learned and set up you can finish a scenario in 20-30 minutes and it is extremely fun.

things to ask myself before buying a game:

great fun, intuitive system (well...it made sense to me), but setup and teardown time are a pain.  Learning games could easily take 4-5 hours, but you don't really notice the downtime since players alternate actions within phases.

I've played ASL a couple of times, and ToI felt very similar but somehow easier. It's a great introduction to "heavier" wargames.

Fun easy war game with eye candy and minis (a bit difficult to handle minis) with some mechanics that bother some more hardcore war gamers - i.e. gamey machine gun and op fire rules... but overall I am happy with the game and will play it when given the opportunity. I think this fills the spot that I hoped Memoir 44 would - just did not like Memoir - seemed to simple (like Battle Cry) and after playing Battlelore so many times I was bored with the simple game play of Memoir. So I am happy with TOI and look forward to expansions and better scenarios. Only complaint at this point is that I wish it was had just a 'bit' more complexity... a few more modifiers for cover, maybe some facing rules, little details etc. But of course there are other games to fit that bill and it does not really detract from this title.

UPDATE:  I want to love the game - and I will have to play it more to really judge. But... the scenarios seem to 'dictate' action more than I like... direct the flow of the game to much. COH does the same thing espeically wi the very tight scenario timing - but I enjoy that game more than this one. That said - it is a tense and fun game - love the graphics and the pieces (difficulty in handling aside) and I hope to give it more play.

I can understand some peoples frustrations, ie fiddly bits and unbalanced scenarios. Hasn't really been a problem for me at all; the figures get easier to put into the bases, and with some organization and experience the set up of everything else doesn't take long. Also customizing your squads gets much quicker over time as you develop general squad-building strats.

As far as unbalanced scenario's go, I don't mind because I had done my research and knew what I was getting when I bought the game. I checked the forums to see which scenarios were reccommended and played those; and then bought the designer series book.

Personally I wanted a complex wwII game, but when showing the guys I play games with, the counters of games like CoH and CC, they weren't very keen to play..
And I personally wasn't really interested in M'44 because it's just too abstract and I don't like the idea of the card driven combat. No doubt it is an excellent game.

Personally I was hoping this would be a gateway game (for my gaming friends) to other more complex wargames, and that may or may not eventuate. Either way I really enjoy playing this game. Perhaps my rating will adjust downwards though if I get the opportunity to play other more complex wargames.

Cool game. Memoir' 44 was fun for a while, but is definitively too light. Tide of iron remains quite a simple game to learn and play, but offers a lot more.

I got this game in a bargaing lot so for me it is not a loss of money: great components, a a lot of them, however, given my game group which is full of ocassional gamers and because of the topic, this game doesn't hit the table very often. ToI has a fast gameplay, it is really thematic and has very cool effects in the cards, scenarios are really clear, straight to the point  and engaging. However, It has a very long set up and rules are quite difficult to grasp at the beginning ( the top 10 worst rulebooks ). I could play it again but we play a lot of confrontational games with less micromanagement.

Oh boy, this one is really great. Played it as a two-player game and also as a four player team game. I just love it. Great design, nothing too inovative here but a nice mix of good elements - you can hardly go wrong with that. The production quality and the sheer mass of material add an extra drool-factor to it. Great game, one of the big hits of 2007 so far...

1/22/09 -- Played twice.  Most recent game was pretty fun.  I probably won't petition the Pope for another game or anything, but I wouldn't be opposed to another go.

Loads of little plastic guys, squad customization, good rules, and rolls enough that randomness has the tendancy of evening out over the course of a game.   Set up time and pushing the little pieces into the bases are the downsides for me.

I like the Command and card economy, as well as the action mechanism, because the whole picture makes for some tough decisions over the course of the game.  

On the other hand, the figures can be very troublesome, with pegs that are frequently too large or too small.

My graduation from Memoir '44. I play a friend's copy from time to time, and it's been quite enjoyable.

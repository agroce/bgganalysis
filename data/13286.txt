RATING: 6
On initial reading, the rules are a nightmare.  Since some things are slightly counter-intuitive for a Euso, it's hard to get to grips with it and the rules aren't written that well.  Having said that, I liked the theme (even if it is quite dryly done).  I enjoyed the race aspect of it and the paying of tributes is different and fun (if hard to get your head around).  It can be a little mathematical, but thata's true of a lot of Euros.

This game seems to think faster than most Geeks! Plays well with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players. Lots of Roman stuff, all in Latin. Wonderful. There are a number of little design-related worries, but greater experience may solve these. A functioning Exactor seems too powerful and also hard to beat, especially in a 2-player. Players may well be taken out permanently through no fault of their own. A definite buy, but not a 9 so far.

Initial view is that the game is well balanced. you can see short term and medium term goals. There is a possibility of catching up with the leader through cooperation but in my first game all players were close to winning. I liked the use of the building cards and the range of options they present. lots of interaction and decision making, but with three people, the downtime was reasonable.

I was interested in getting Gloria Mundi a decade ago, but the lacklustre reviews made me change my mind. Now, having finally played it, I can't get over how much fun it is!

It's not an engine-building game, but rather an agonizing engine-maintenance game. The Goths are your gremlins, and most of the play focuses on when to buy them off and when not to: it's a virtual guarantee that a Gothic rampage will hurt you, but is now the time to let them run amok or should you delay the inevitable?

Gloria Mundi straddles the line between a tactical and a strategic game: your moves are essentially tactical, but they are usually for the purpose of maintaining your long-term progress (and thus you need to keep a winning strategy in mind). You must build essentially useless projects for the sole purpose of keeping your useful projects from being hit! Yes, it's very painful.

The only major negative I find is that (like most racing games) the winner of Gloria Mundi can usually be seen well before the game actually ends; but still, for most of the game, it's a nail-biter.

I played Lewis & Clark long before I played Gloria Mundi, and it seems that L&C was an attempt to redo Gloria Mundi as a true strategic engine-builder, and much deeper than its predecessor. M. Chaboussit certainly achieved his goal: but I do find Gloria Mundi to be a more tense and more enjoyable game.

A game where the central driving mechanic is regular, somewhat predictable, destruction phases demolishing players' card engines.  Some, I suppose, might enjoy the destruction, but for me, it feels pointlessly and gratuitously unpleasant.  The game also includes a "shopping for cards" mechanic that has some appeal, but sadly, that feels underwhelming and strangely chaotic.

Nice bits, but I really don't like this type of game. Build, build, build...then wipe it all away. Feels like one step forward, two steps back. I ended up really wanting this to end.
Some balance issues around some of the cards may exist as well. Not sure I want to play this again.

RATING: 4
Played once with 5.  Lots of downtime,  as it is quite difficult to do much planning in advance of your turn.  Some of the cards (the ones offering movement) appear to be much stronger than the others,  so if someone can get one of these plus something to get resources, there seems to be little scope to catch them.  Loss of green cards early on seems to be crippling (getting more cards out helps the players who already have them, so you get even further back).  Too long, although I guess this would get better with practice.

It has cool pieces and a very interesting mechanic with the way they are strewn out on the path to Rome. And a Goth, there's a Goth. But it's possible to get really screwed in this game.

I really wanted to like this one but this clearly needed better playtesting. The card costs were way off and the fragile drafting mechanic simply didn't work as it put people out of contention through no fault of their own. Played 2 times in succession, bought it because I thought it had potential, player another 4 games in succession and gave it away. Best of luck to the current owner.

Played once with the rules explained to me!  Perhaps this game would play decently with fewer players.  With 4, I found the game just stupidly random in terms of Goth screwage and Building card selection.  I probably would like it better if the deck was divided into 3 separate phases such that the building costs would get progressively more expensive.  Actually this fix probably wouldn't help at all since the Goth would just destroy your Building combos before you even got the chance to activate the stupid things. 

On the bright side I liked the little "lite bright" pawns and the "evil looking" Goth piece.  Other than that, I feel as if I wasted a good portion of a gaming session on something that I will probably never play again.  60 minutes?  It took us over two hours!  After 90 minutes I suggested to the group that we should just pack it up and play something else!  Unfortunately, I had to continue playing until the Goth finally arrived in Rome.

RATING: 6
A racing game. You use cards to acquire resources to buy buildings, ships, military to help you escape from Rome and Italy before the Goths arrive. You also try to slow down your opponents so they don't run farther than you and win. I enjoy this game because it requires detailed analysis to play well, taking many factors into consideration such as your opponent's resources showing, cards remaining in their hands, probable future actions, trying to outsmart then and gain an edge.

Update: The tactical challenges in the game may not be enough to hold my interest. Still willing to play it though.

It was kinda hard to get your mind around this game but its fun! The thing to keep in mind is that everything you build will razed to the group...and very fast. It's not like other Euro games where you accumulate and keep resources to spend in the future. Here you build, then see it destroyed very quickly. Once you accept that, you can enjoy the game. Very tactical and not strategic.

RATING: 8
First play. Learning the game correctly from the box rules is made as difficult as possible by virtue of the dreadful wording and at times contradictory text. I read the rules 4 times slogging through trying desperately to grasp the concepts which need more examples to illuminate the vague text. In the end BGG rules forum was the only way to appreciate what was going on.

This is a shame as this is a very clever and fundamentally simple game (mechanics wise) with considerable depth of play. No dice which is good and the need to keep ahead of the game for when the Goths are burning your developments down.

Took more than 1 hour (2 actually) but guess it would speed up when you are au-fait with the rules.

RATING: 7
Inital rating - need to play it more (and with more than 2!)

Feels a bit like an AT in Euro clothing, which might explain the bashing it seems to get from people, and why I like it.

It's refreshing to play a game where you're mostly trying to cope with stuff being destroyed around you, and although there is luck of the card flip you can get a card that appears if you have sufficient resources. Definitely not a multi-player solo game, you need to keep an eye on others and decide when to tribute and when not to, and try to predict what turn type others will select.

Overall, like it.

RATING: 6
The Ernest (Cheapass) heritage was a huge red flag for me, but Gloria Mundi wasn't too bad. Try to build up your infrastructure in the face of pillaging goths, and get out of town before they arrive. Not bad, and interesting choices from time to time. But it also has minimal player interaction, downtime problems, and is hugely chaotic (and the chaos increases significantly as you add players; I have to think the 6-player game would careen off into the realm of complete randomness), and Gloria Mundi is honestly too long given everything else. The box says 60 minutes; we took two hours. At 60 minutes it might have been much more appealing. The final problem, and it's significant, is the graphic design on the cards. The symbology of the various special powers is obtuse to the point of incomprehensibility at times.

Still, despite all this, it was kinda fun, and I think most casual games will enjoy playing it once (just stick with smaller numbers of players, I think; 4 worked OK). And it was nicely thematic - struggling to fight a losing battle to build up your infrastructure while Rome burns. But I don't have any real desire to play it again. The 2 hour playing time was a real killer (although I imagine it would come down somewhat on future games).

(Playability 7.9 of 10)- mostly independent effort, moderate reliance on others, and slight reliance on luck. Age recommendation = 13 and up, making this game a fair one for adults

A good solid game this. If you can purchase the right combination of buildings and keep them standing then it increses your chances in this one. Very nice mechanics and felt very fresh as far as gameplay goes. Great Job. Green buildings seem very important in the grander scheme of winning this game. I'm looking forward to more games anyway. The game seems to hang on when you move the Goth. 7 Plays.

This has a difficult set of rules which are somewhat opaque. Several readings will allow one to get what is intended. A couple of the game mechanisms seem to provide unneeded variety - it felt like extra variety without extra value. The biggest problem for me, though, was that the overriding mechanism seemed broken. The Goth is coming (this is good). You must leave Rome (also good). But the way in which this is combined makes me think that either idea would have stood better on its own. If the Goth gets to Rome, why does it matter who is furthest from Rome (the winner)? It seems to me that everyone would "win" except for the person still closest to Rome. Maybe I'm over-thinking this, but the very good individual ideas in this game simply did not gel for me and it produced a very unsatisfying game.

RATING: 2
Gloria Mundi is a game of opposites, and I don't think there's much room for the middle ground. In my case, the negatives take the upper hand, as my first game during Spiel 2006 will also be my last. 

The game is at its heart a racing game with a collect-resources-and-build-stuff engine. Fat, lazy Romans are fleeing the empire towards Africa as the Goths march into Italy. You want to appease the barbarians as much as keep hanging on to your old way of life, therefore resources need to be kept an eye on. The theme isn't that bad or un-earthly&mdash;in fact, it's rather clever and fitting. But now its execution in an actual game. Despite you fleeing Italy, you meander all over the place along an unclear path with plenty of opportunity to look at the wrong spaces. The resources themselves are small and are handed back and forth all over the place, disrupting game flow. The entire game is driven by a card deck: an unoriginal mechanic which opens up the infamous can of worms of luck of the draw and more.  Your tactics seem to be composed of building lots of surplus lands so that when the Goths are not appeased, you don't lose any valuable cards. Fitting very well into the subject to the point of being original, even though not very pleasant is the realisation that the winner is actually the one who was most efficient at [i]destroying[/i] his own buildings. Really damning is the fact that you cannot hurt someone directly, but have to spread out the hurt over everyone. As Crowley already noticed in Neil Gaiman's brilliant work [i]Good Omens[/i], such low-grade but constant nastiness is far more effective at annoying people than straight, clear punches in the gut. Despite the good idea, actually playing Gloria Mundi therefore becomes a grating experience which sets my teeth on edge.

In my only game to date, I also discovered that slow players ruin the experience for everyone: this game is meant to be played quickly. You cannot plan all that much. And even with quick players, it drags on for too long, never resulting in tense moments. I feel a 2 doesn't do justice to the good background story, but regrettably, I really do not want to play this game again.

This game is close to being good.  Unfortunately, it barely misses.  The result is a frustrating game where it seems like the game plays you.  My one experience was a 5er game that took 3 hours (including rules).  The box says 60minutes!  No way this game can be completed in 60 minutes, unless all players just make random decisions...which might as well be the case.  Besides playing time, the Goth mechanic just doesn't work.  You spend time trying to get buildings.  The game gives the illusion that you will be able to use those buildings.  But keeping those buildings is nearly impossible because of the random nature of the Goths.  The farms are overly powerful as you have more green buildings to protect your buildings. I tried putting down all my gold resources to protect my gold buildings.  I was mostly unsuccessful as I lost 3 of my 4 cards...and really could have lost them all had the player to my right felt like zapping them.  It is a zero-sum game with your buildings.  It is total luck/chaos as to whether you are a point above or below that zero-sum.  I'm tempted to rate it a bit lower, but there is some sad, masochistic part of me that would allow myself to be talked into playing it again.

RATING: 5
Players represent ancient Roman nobles, trying to put on a brave face while the Goths gradually close in on Rome.  Fast playing game where players play a card to enhance/trigger production (of food, "peace", and gold); production allows them to build buildings which are two pronged - they enhance production, but they also enable these upstanding pillars to begin fleeing Rome for Carthage!  Finally, the Goths advance a step, or can be temporarily bought off by paying them tribute.  Sooner or later they will advance, however, and ravage the players' holdings.  The winner is the closest to Carthage when the game ends.  This game is a mixed bag of quick playing "gather stuff, build stuff", with an undercurrent of nastiness and devastation.  I was quite surprised to find myself really enjoying it - good solid game.

It's important to keep your neighbor in check.  If everybody does that, then the game can be more strategic.  But otherwise, it is possible for some people to be left alone and get a large number of cards in play, which will make them hard to stop.  That kind of gameplay will rub some people the wrong way.  I enjoyed playing this game, despite the flaws and still had enough fun.

Only one play. Awful. I'm not sure if I'll be willing to play this one-dimensional game ever again. Why would you ever buy building cards that don't advance you on the board continuously? Half of the deck is useless. We played with six and perhaps the game would be more enjoyable with fewer. A geek-buddy of mine claims that the game is "entertaining, but it's not very fun". I didn't think it was either.

Poorly translated English rules combine with card abilities which are portrayed purely by symbols - and the meaning of the symbols, especially the 'x', is inconsistent - creating a muddled mess of the rules.  Once you get past all this there is a good game here.  I had to bring my rating down a point due to the fact that the 'x' on the cards is used to mean at least 3 different things - NOT the way to go language-free!

UPDATE: Now that I've printed and used the player aids here on BGG, I like it even better.  I like the fact that you're hanging on by your fingernails, building things as others are destroyed out from under you.  You're lucky to get a handful of good uses from each one, and part of the strategy is knowing when to let something be destroyed. All this destruction has the upside of keeping the game manageable and cards effects easy to track, as you rarely have more than a handful of building cards in play at a time.

I enjoyed my first game of Gloria Mundi. It was a pleasant surprise. Something I would want to replay again. Not sure that this game is for everyone. Sure a lot of chaos since there is a lot of destruction during the game.

Manage your resources to build buildings which gives certain abilities. Some cards are better than others. Screwage and destruction, the never ending cycle. Random, repetitive. Not sure about the replay value of this game. I need to play it again. Rule book could be a little better written. More players you got, more downtime there is.

But, overall fun game if you enjoy games with a choatic element to them.

TRADED.

RATING: 3.5
Interesting mechanics, but the randomness basically decides the game. Some of the cards are just much more powerful than others, and there's little to balance this out: it's chance that determines which cards you have access to for what price.

And the length. Ugh! Maybe if we played 4x faster, this would be a fun game. As it was, I'll take option B, please.

RATING: 7
It's an interesting tableau-building game where everyone's cards are at constant risk of getting destroyed.  The market cards are expensive enough that you can't just grab any card after one turn of production.  And you can't just spam one type of production because your actions are limited.

RATING: 4.5
game works fine but it could use a FAQ for a few cards and rules.
(without it you'll have to reason out a few items). My issue is
there are some real Analysis Paralysis issues, and game play DRAGS
between turns. (few things to do on other players turns) Luck of the card
draw can also play a big role in the outcome, also it has a little bit of the
take that syndrome and has *effectual* player ellimination.(i'm out of it with 4 turns
to go and only have a kingmaker role left). Otherwise the game plays/works 
fine, just not something I really want to play.

warning: I've only played 5/6 player. 2  hour games. If the game clocked in at the
60 min. box time my rating would improve.

RATING: 2
A game so devoid of flair and fun that it is like the marrow has been sucked out of it's bones. Problem 1: how and when the Goth moves can screw you up royally, but basically there is nothing that you can do against other players destroying your income. Therefore you just watch what happens each round, and that is deadly for the fun factor. 2: The "race" to Africa is so boring and abstract that you might find a game of "tic tac toe" more exciting 3: The cards' iconography is so confusing that one desperately needs a Boardgamegeek player aid to understand them. But I cannot see how any normal person can understand the game out of the box 4: The rules are so obtuse and strangely worded that your head reels even after one paragraph. We had 5 extremely experienced gamers sitting around the board simply scratching their heads about the meaning of certain rules. Why? 5: You are played, you don't play yourself 6: The theme doesn't work, a huge board is needed for a game which could have been a simple card game and would have probably been much better. 
Sorry, but this is one of the worst professionally produced games of Essen 2006.

Didn't seem to grab anyone.  I would like to play again, but it is going to be hard to find enough to play.  2nd play was with 6, and a total disaster.  Not one person liked it--no one got more than a few steps from Rome, any buildings built were immediately distroyed.  Completely boring for the others.  They said the idea sounds good but rules need revision.  I liked it much better than the others.  I plan to keep this--hope to find others to play.

I enjoy playing this game.  The only hard part is keeping straight what the various Building Cards do and which ones are most valuable to play and when.  The board is beautiful and the pieces look and feel nice.  It does feel like the Goth's destruction is less predictable to control when a long time passes before someone decides not to pay a tribute.  Overall I want to play this game a lot more to get better at it and to understand it's strategies better.  The mechanics all seem so interesting in this game.

Rating based on a single 6 player game. There is a very strong "beat" to this game, and it's very difficult to control, at least with 6 players. This game is not a lot of fun to start with, so you would expect it to be strategical and tactical. Unfortunately, it is not, mostly due to the uncontrollable "beat" and the randomness of the card draw. Also, there is a lot of downtime. This could be quite different with 4 players, though, so my rating may change.

It just doesn't feel like it's finished - but please understand I've only played 2 games, so that's hardly enough to know. But initial impressions are that there's little in the way of tough decisions and angst in the game. I see little more than three decisions on your turn: 1) whether or not to buy a card; 2) which "color" to activate; and 3) whether or not to move the Goth or pay him off. Beyond that, decisions seem very limited.

Forget the bad vibe on BGG.  I find this 2006 game very enjoyable in 2016, provided you get the rules right (and have little individual cups for all the pieces, especially the offerings, as its nice to pass the bowl around).  So definitely print out the nice rule summary on BGG and stick it in the box.  It has everything I like in a game I will keep.  A clarity of pieces and processes, nice art, the complex bit (the builder cards) come out one at as time, so the players can read / understand them in a gradual process rather than being confronted with everything at the beginning.  The theme is pasted on, but still works.  What I do like is that it is a game about not developing an engine with your cards, but working hard to strop the destruction of your card engine.  And yes, the game can definitely be cruel, but you can win without not setting off the Goth.  The box size is way too large for the components, and the box colour makes it sadly look like a game from the 90s, but if you see this game in a bargain bin, I do recommend.  However, you must print the rule summary on BGG, and even with that, remember that when you don't tribute, and there are no offerings in front of the Goth so it moves one space, the number of players who lose production cards is equal to the number of icons, its not ALL players (Rating 7.482, Aug 16)

Birthday present Dec 09. First try at the game 2-26-10 with Barbara. Think we got all the rules correct. Hard to get head around the idea that the buildings are disposable and many will indeed be eaten up by the Goth. Don't forget that the object of the game is to get as far away from Rome as possible before game ends. Buildings help do that even if you lose them on the next turn.

What a pleasant surprise this game was!  Rating based on a single, four-player session, I definitely would like to revisit this game soon. Other than the clear plastic bits (where did that idea come from?) the components are lovely, especially the cards.  Choose a card out of your hand which will give you (and some or all of your opponents!) various resources, buy a card if you can that will improve your ability to achieve the goal of winning the game, and pay-off the Goth or let him wreak havoc...the choice is yours.

I'll meet you in Carthage, preferably after I've been there longer than you!

Thanks to a HORRIBLE manual I didn't enjoy this game at all. For starters you can't learn from the rules what 'behind' means when talking about the pawn movement. Then some unclear places describing the usage of the building (with almost no ilustrations) and you have two basic mechanisms of the game unclear as hell.

Probably the game itself is at least decent. I didn't have the oportunity to find out.

Can be a little of a brain burner, and very cutthroat. Players have to realize that you can't avoid losing buildings. Even if players agree to "play nice", eventually someone will not be able to pay the Goth, and there will be a ton of destruction. It's better to purposely not pay the Goth on your own terms, so that you can manage the destruction (and make it worse for your opponent(s) than for you.

Played once with six players, using the suggested tweak for six (one fewer green card).  Gloria Mundi is a fundamentally mathematically flawed game.  One or more players face a strong possiblity (certainty?) of being doomed by other players' decisions.  I wasn't faced with a single interesting or non-obvious decision to make throughout the game, which lasted far longer than the rated 60 minutes.  And there was another player at the table who was even worse off than I.  You've been warned.  This is not a game with a "kingmaking problem" - it is a game whose essential decision forces kingmaking, again and again and again.  If you insist on slowing down to gawk at this car wreck, I suggest you do it with a group of only three players.  Maybe then it will work, but it doesn't even come close to working with six.  I'm confident that it would be better with three, but I'm also confident that it would still be pretty bad.  Gloria Mundi is all process and no game, and never allows players to break loose from its coercive game engine.

I had a very good first impression but have not had a desire to play this much. Every time I think about it I feel like the game is just a little tedious. Constantly fighting to stay afloat. 

The decisions feel a little scripted. Each time it is your turn it is rather obvious which of the three card types you should play. The only real decisions come down to whether or not you will pay tribute (seems easily calculable) and which buildings to buy (and you are often limited to only 2 of these that are available given your building types and resources). Furthermore, the Glory resource is significantly underintegrated. It plays almost no role and is silly. And the buildings are painfully imbalanced.

Could have been so much better. I still think that a completely redesigned deck of cards could vastly improve this game. Will hold on to for now because it is unique, but I could see it hitting the trading stacks soon.

Simple basic mechanic but fiddly cards with unclear icons and unintuitive rules.

I see some good potential in this game. The first run through was a bit hesitant. Made some mistakes that probably had some effect on the outcome. For instance at least twice we paid the wrong bribe to the goth and at least once forgot to pay it altogether but did not advance the goth. Looking forward to trying again.

Now with a second play under the belt, this gamee is starting to feel better. Still made a few mistakes regarding how the cards affect movement toward Africa, but the game seemed to flow much better this time around. Upgrading the rating to 7.5 from the original 7. Would go higher, but just not sure how often I might pull this out. with all the symbols on the cards it is a bit confusing for someone to try the first couple of times around.

In our first game, we had missed the following very important setup instruction:
"[i]"Each player places one of his production cards of each type, face up, in his play area in front of his screen".[/i]".

Tried it a second time and something just does not feel right, as it is too easy to take out a good building from your neighbor to the left (i.e. next player), and there is nothing he/she can do to prevent it, nor can he/she attack you back.  I really PO'ed my neighbor to the left as I only had (3) farms, and he would loose a City or Legion whenever it was my turn as I could seldom pay the tribute.

[u]Positive[/u]:
The mounted board is nice, and I really like the cards.  The purchasing and production mechanics are good, especially the combos that can be had.

[u]Negative[/u]:
The box should have been smaller, and the board, although nice, could have been just a straight line (although it looks good, it serves no purpose other than as a component place holder and a race track).  The wooden blocks are too small.

I played with 5 players and it wasn't so good.  Cards that actually helped you get VPs were very hard to get, and as soon as they were flipped up, they were taken by the next player or two in line.  I tried saving up to get some good buildings and run for it in the end, but it didn't work so well.  I felt the game was rather long and painful, probably because of the Goth decision.

RATING: 5
I love the idea of a game themed around running away, but that's really the best bit of what's on offer here. The buildings vary widely in value, the ones that allow you to move forward towards safety when some condition is met seem much more useful than those that simply allow you to change resources. It's largely a matter of chance which buildings are available on your turn and the icons on the cards are far from clear. Nice plastic bits though.

The rules are really hard to understand but I used the summary and explanation in this review to better understand them:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/128715
I played a couple of sample turns and went back and forth between review and rules and figured it out.

The other thing you really need is the card reference sheet:

This game has a seriously flawed mechanic where you have to hurt yourself to hurt the leader and if the player to the right of the leader is unwilling to take a hit to hurt the leader at the right time, there will be a runaway leader.Not to mention the way the mechanic works is unevenly distributed.  

Also, the green space movement cards are VERY overpowered.  God help you if somebody gets 2 and their neighbor won't take a hit from the Goth at the right time to bury some of his opponent's cards.  Bleh

I was very happily surprised by my playing of this game.  I understand why some would not like it.  Careful planning is subject to brutal "take thats" from your neighbors.  However, I did not find it particularly chaotic.  You can see it coming, even if you can't stop it.  Also the general game play was novel.  I am not sure there is much that can be done about a runaway leader -- and that might happen due to card happenstance.  But still, there is enough of interest in the box to keep me coming back -- at least occasionally.

RATING: 4
initial rating 1 play 5 players

I wanted to like this but I had some problems right off the hop, randomness and lack of control being the key issues. 

Pros: 

- Fairly original and feels different than other games I have played
- High Screwage/Destruction factor if you like that makng for some fun (I usually do anyway)
- Theme wasn't bad

Cons: 

- Choices usually too obvious AND somewhat impossible at times as well due to your current resources and what card "just popped up"
-Not enough planning can be done so it lacks in the strategy dept
- Cards come out randomly which effects when and if you can buy them and how much you will pay due to the track (very bad and creates a lack of control), this might have been done better in an auction format or if the person who's turn it is does not buy the last card on the track it goes up for sale. 
- Screwage is also somewhat random, you can sometimes calculate who will get screwed and where but other times you won't know or won't have control over it and thus the leader can keep running away. You have some control at times on how bad you will get screwed but the carpet could be completely be pulled from under you at other times and this is not good. Choices are limited concerning screwage due to what colors are on the board or if there is none then it makes no sense and therefore too obvious as well. 
- Slightly long for what it is
- Slight kingmaker effects possible in the mid and end game as you can be virtually knocked out or at the end your final card determines the winner which is an unsatisfying way for a game of this length or any length to end

This might be better as a 2 or especially a 3 player game increasing control and planning and I would probably try it although I don't see how the screwage/destruction factor will be interesting or any good with only 2. The purchase track will certainly make more sense at these numbers though which will help but I don't think these things can save the game. 

Rating could increase or more than likely fall more depending on the 2 or 3 player game

The game is a fairly nice race game comparable to [b]Around the World in 80 Days[/b] with a bit of resource management thrown in for good measure.

The Goth movement track is quite novel in that it controls the length of the game and also helps to balance players hands... sometimes the decision of what to destroy can be quite maddening.

The building cards remind me of the Mission cards in [b]Louis XIV[/b], one of my favourite games of 2005, so [b]Gloria Mundi[/b] is a winner. After repeat plays, I game give this one a solid '7.'

Gloria Mundi is an enjoyable race game with an ancient theme slapped onto it. There are enough meaningful decisions here to make for a satisfying experience. Tension mounts throughout the game, and it is often unclear who will win until the final turn. I'm not a huge fan of racing games, but Gloria Mundi was a pleasant surprise.

I have played this game with 2 players and 5 and I have felt no joy in playing it.  The game is well themed.  When I played it, it was as fun as getting maurauded by Visigoths, only less stimulating.

The game does have some novel mechanics, I will give it that.

I am intrigued by the high ratings and enthusiasm here on the geek and internet which was one of the reasons I picked it up (I blame YOU, Bruno Faidutti!) :) .  The response by others I have played it with has been so dismal that I am really curious to find people who enjoy this game and perhaps watch them play it.  Kind of like a UFO sighting- I don't know if I can actually believe that people have fun with this game until I see it with my own eyes.  I want to see what I am missing.

One of the first James Earnest games I've liked.  Simple but effective production system with the ability to buy special powers that keep getting knocked down.  The game is nasty by nature, and it's not a question of whether you'll smack your fellow players but when.  Of course, everybody gets smacked kind of equally, so the pain isn't so bad.

People have complained that they can't really build up a big production system because of the way production keeps getting destroyed.  This is the nature of the game.  Once you realize you can only get so far ahead, that it's a three steps forward, two steps back game, you can relax and enjoy it.  True, though, it is difficult to create a really effective system of interlocking powers in the way you might do in Puerto Rico.

RATING: 7.5
The rule book is horrible, but this game is super fun.  I'ts an economic driven race if you will.  It's like you took stone age, got rid of all the actions exept buying cards, and made victory points really a race to Carthage.  Oh and there's also a giant pink monster who blows your cards up.

update: after several more plays I'm liking this game more and more.  I have my complaints but there is a subtle richness to the game that draws me back each time.

Not a fan of this game.  It is hard to build anything up because it is so easy for someone to not pay their tax and ruin everything everyone has.  It is difficult to make any progress before the barabarians hit Rome.  The components are average.  Just a ho-hum game.

Undecided on rating after one play. You build an engine by purchasing cards, though in our game three quarters of the cards were too expensive to afford even on the lowest rung of the market. You have to build extra stuff just for the Goth to destroy so he doesn't destroy your valuable cards, which feels more like treading water than progressing. I won, but didn't really feel like I was succeeding during the game.

Decent game. I was a bit wary about the destruction aspect of the game, but as the original game owner pointed out before I picked it off him, as long as it's done with thought, the game's actually fun and balanced. After playing it twice, I also agree that 3-4 players is really the way this should be played.

I wanted to like this game, but between the setup time and the feeling of chaos while playing the game, it just never ends up being particularly fun.  Now I understand that the game is supposed to feel chaotic - we're talking about the final days of the Roman empire after all, with the Visigoths on their way to sack and burn everything - but while I applaud the designer(s) for successfully evoking that feeling, I don't enjoy playing with it.

This game should be played with 4 people. No more, no less. With more than 4, it seems that the same 2 people at the table get hit every time, while another 2 people at the table never do.

Ok card game with a huge board to keep track of the score, but also some original mechanisms. Focus on the object of the game: to get as far away from Rome as possible. Building a combination of buildings which generate "automatic" victory points and trying to keep them is a key element. Unfortunately, our first game ended with a player having to choose between two production cards, each would give the victory to another player due to VP on the buildings. I hope this kingmaker situation doesn't occur too often. Second game was a lot better with a very close finish of all the 6 players. Third game was a bummer, runaway leader in 3 player game based on a strong early combo. Frustrating experience to see it happen and not being able to counter at all.

A quirky racing game where you progress in game turns by playing land cards to acquire resources to buy a combination special buildings that you place on the land cards.  Goth serves as an interesting timing (end game) mechanism that can wreck havoc if you overbuild or build too early and too often without defenses.  Try not to buy or build too early if you don't know what you're building (aim for the long-term, not the short-term).  Be patient and look for or plan for your building combos.  It's a game where it is important to build the right combination of buildings that help or synergize each another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A breath of fresh air introducing what seems to me to be different mechanics that aren't totally repackaged from other games.  Building different structures based on a mixture of different requirements of resources isn't necessarily different, but the added tension of deciding whether to pay tribute or to bring Gothic destruction upon a number of people around the table is a fascinating twist.  Not only does the game involve economic use of resources which face destruction every turn, its actually more of a race game as the winner is the player who is furthest from Rome when the Goths sack Rome!  Played twice thus far with three people.  Not a forgiving game for making mistakes!  Prone to runaway leaders and proves difficult oft times to catch up if more than 5 spaces behind the leader.  Best with 3-4 people.

I tend to like nasty games so I had high hopes for Gloria Mundi. After a few plays however, I must admit it's been nothing but utter deception. The rules are catastrophic, the iconography is unclear and the Goth looks like an escapee from a bad japanese anime. The gameplay itself sorely lacks playtesting as is clearly evidenced by the unbalanced cards. But the worst part is that it all feels so automatic: you don't get to make real decision very often and the few times you do won't make a big difference anyway because randomness affects the game so much. If you fall behind early in a 5 or 6 player game, be prepared for a long and painful march with almost no hope of ever catching up. Boring.

***

Fun race game with a "decline of civilization" theme that's quite hilarious. Oh my gosh, the barbarians are coming, the barbarians are coming! Gloria Mundi's mechanics of resource and hand management give it rather more breadth or complexity than most racing type games, which keeps it interesting for adults and gives it good replayablity. And of course the marauding Goth keeps it amusing and exciting with his path of destruction if you can't or decide not to appease him (there are times when it is far more strategic to let him destroy because your opponent has more to lose than you do..).

We play with some house rules for 2-3 players to ramp up the game faster and add a couple of twists: 

1. Each player starts with 3 each of food, gold, and peace - so buildings can be bought earlier in the game.

2. Each player gets a tribute token that can be used once in the game - with it you can force another player to pay the tribute to the Goth - it can save you when you can't pay, or prevent another player from buying a desireable building during her/his next turn.

3. Each player gets a building token that can be used once in the game - with it you can forcibly purchase another player's building. You pay him/her the building purchase price, and you get to take the movement points for purchasing a building, plus the building of course.

4. No hidden information - we play without the screens to hide your resources. We tend to favor games without hidden info, but it works perfectly well with if you want to hide your stuff behind the screens.

With these rules, the game goes very fast with a good sense of progression, has little downtime, and gets an added couple of differently flavored decision points. Woohoo!!! Great game thouhg, however you play it. Nice light strategy game with excellent tactical opportunities and interesting decision points, a good sense of progression throughout the game (especially with our house rules), and just plain fun.

Wasn't expecting much from this game after reading the crummy rulebook, which is not only poorly edited and incoherent (what it says about Goth movement makes absolutely NO sense - check the Geek's rules clarification thread if you get stuck) but misses the opportunity to add flavor to the games ingenious premise. You're a corrupt, cowardly ancient Roman aristocrat whose sole purpose in developing your estates and properties is to bribe your way out of Italy as quickly as possible before the barbarians arrive and trash everything. The game itself is a clever, original, and tactically suspenseful implementation of this idea that's also a pleasure to look at and fiddle around with. It's a little over-dependent on luck of the draw, but that's hardly surprising, give the theme.

Man what turd of a game.  About my second turn I just wanted the game to be over.  The Appeasing the Goth mechanic is just plan nuts.

[Played 2 times]
A classic "gather resources to convert them into buildings having special properties to get more resources and victory points" game. Unfortunately marred by semi-random screwage and constant loss of what you've done.
Decisions feeel often constrained and obvious.
The cards doesn't seem well balanced at all.
May be decent with just two players (more control and no "collateral damage"). 
With several players, downtime is unbearable.
The rulebook could have been done better.
Random, repetitive, unsatisfying. Disappointing, especially after such a long wait (it was delayed for more than a year).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game with unusual ideas is more dependent on clear and concise rules than other games are, and the muddled mess of its rulebook definitely hurts Gloria Mundi a lot. My other problem is the complexity and sheer number of building cards, whose many fiddly little exceptions place an even higher burden on the rulebook. And I'm not convinced about their balance, especially regarding how they scale with the number of players, but this is something I'd have to find out in further plays.

That I'm willing to actually play again in spite of all these problems is just because there is a lot to like in Gloria Mundi, not least of which is the willingness to try something new: a development game where your valuable commodities will get sacked almost as fast as you can build them.

Played once.

RATING: 8.081
To sum this game up in one word, it's great.  Not the best game I've played, but certainly not the worst.  I like the board and pieces, but the rules are ridiculous.  It took several read-throughs, one game, and numerous cross-checks with the Geek in order to get the rules down.  Some pics and examples of play would have cleared a lot of things up that were confusing.  Hear that, Rio Grande?  Hire somebody competant to write your rulebooks!

Otherwise, the game is fine, has too big of a box, and will probably see a lot of play.  Maybe not a favorite, but there is that possibility.

This one seems to get a bad press but I like it a lot.  The rulebook's a problem.  The rules are all there, but the layout is terrible and important points are lost in what looks like acres of text.

Our games always feel like we're flying by the seat of our pants, which adds to the tension with the big pink Goth baring down on us.

Not really sure what to think on this.  Only played once. The way our five player game went it was very, very difficult to keep the building cards.

RATING: 6
I've played three-player games eight times, four-player games four times, and a five-player game once. Gloria Mundi is... OK. That pretty well sums it up. I did think for a game with limited choices, it sort of wore out its welcome (it drags near the end). In most of the games I played one player got behind early on, and there was no way for him to catch up. The winner in every game I've played was the player who bought one (or two) of the "movement engine" cards (e.g. bovarium, piscatorium, circus, mausoleum, taberna, schola, or colosseum) that allows one to move 2-3 spaces almost every turn. If they could hang on to it they always won. They would just chug along to victory and not much could be done about it. 

-  Since I wasn't the owner this isn't my concern per se, but the way the components fit in the box looked like a blind man designed it. Nice art work on the cards, but some of the icons are not intuitive at all. And even after consulting the rule book we were unsure we understood them.

Our games have always started calmly and built up the tension very nicely, so that by the time the players are half way to Africa, the decisions of which turns to call, who to help and who to hinder, become very agonising indeed.

A big deck of building cards give this one a lot of replayability.

The rules are ok, but a little dry to read, and the functions of the cards could have done with a little more explaining, but this is a minor quibble.

Absolutely horrible as a 5 or 6 player game.  Don't do it!  It looks like it could be OK as a 2-4 player game, but it was so BAD as a 5 and 6 player game that I don't ever care to play it again.  I don't see the main flaw going away with fewer players though...that the main thing you're trying to do is gain resources to build awesome buildings to help you win the game...but those buildings are often extremely expensive and time-consuming to acquire, then it's quite possible that building will be destroyed before you can even use it.  Extremely frustrating and seemingly broken game in my opinion.

Game of running away and destruction.  Can be brutal.  Don't play with friends unless you know each other well....Downgrading one rank due to lack of table time and so many other good games.

RATING: 6
During the fall of the Roman Empire, one attempts to make it the furthest along to Africa, as the Goth slowly approach Rome. There are three types of resources: legions, cities, and forests. Each turn, you play one of the types out of your hand, and activating those resources. You erect buildings on your land, and the buildings give you special bonuses. At the end of your turn, you must pay resources to prevent the Goth from moving. If you do not, the Goth destroy buildings. This is a game where you try to minimize the destruction, rather than try to slowly build up your buildings. If you do not like the idea of having your buildings destroyed in an almost ad hoc manner, then this game is not for you. This game is all about trying to generate resources so you can buy buildings, use them before they get destroyed to be the first to Africa. It takes a different mentality to play, and will take a few games to learn. There is a lot of luck in which buildings show up for you to build, and the game does depend on what other people do. If others are playing forests, you are almost forced to follow suit, otherwise your unique reasource buildings will be fodder for the Goth.

RATING: 6
The impending Goth invasion and the run to Africa is entertaining to say the least. The Goth is among the most vile and destructive character I've encountered in games. However, it's little more than another balance-your-resources-(and-run). The rulebook is under all critique and the box is is one of those where the inlays are for a different game.

RATING: 5
The board!  The bits!  The buildings!  *Sigh* ... Gloria Mundi looks and sounds like a game that I would enjoy quite a bit, but the playing experience is largely a matter of mounting frustration and an unplesantly La Citta-ish downward spiral.  You play resource production cards, then cover them up with buildings, many of which are overpriced and some of which are way cooler than others.  Then, as the other players take some rather lengthy turns, you sacrifice them to the Goth, often without getting a chance to use them, and your ability to move towards Carthage (the whole point of the game;  it's a race, not a city-building affair) is repeatedly crippled.  I understand that it was the designers' intention to produce an endurance-based game rather than yet another friendly Euro, but I don't think they took sufficient steps to prevent runaway loser problems.  The first time I played, I grabbed a sizable early lead by buying a building that let me turn "peace" (brilliantly represented by white bricks produced by armed soldiers) into extra moves.  But, once I lost that one card half way through the game, I only got to move one more time.  My second play was a bit smoother (fewer players), but no more fun.  There is just too much screwage here, by the other players and by the game itself, for my liking.

I played a prototype of this a couple of years before it was published and was unimpressed. I was curious to see if the retail version had improved on things, so I gave it another shot. Boy, was that a disappointing experience! This is a game that could be the poster boy for all the people that don't like Eurogames. The theme is so tacked on it's laughable, and the gameplay is a dull, never-ending series of resource management. The gameplay is headache inducing, due to the cryptic symbols on the cards, the convoluted way everything interacts with each other, and the mind-numbingly boring tasks you need to focus on to make progress. Please don't ask me to endure this mess again.

The theme is very strange, but I tried it. Essentially, you have to manage your resources and claw your way up to building a structure, then it gets destroyed by the Visigoths.  If you want this experience, become a homeless person or an illegal  immigrant and live in fear. Very clunky game play.

Gloria Mundi is an original and vicious game about racing and managing destruction. It works very well with only two players and plays in an hour or an hour and a half, which is nice. Many negative comments have been made about the game, but, it seems to me, the game is not bad at all. Some players seem to think this is a game about building but it's not: it's about letting go!

RATING: 6.4
Better than the average rating here on the 'Geek might lead you to believe. 

The game has some "only hit the guy on your left" problems, and it seems like the closer someone is to your right the less impact you can have on them.

The Goth-advancing mechanism is neat, but it has some serious problems.  For example, there are many times in which declining to pay tribute several times in a row just keeps hitting the fellow next to play, despite him not having done anything wrong or had any flaws in his strategy.  

This game would have been better if it was held in development for a while longer.  There is a lot to like, but sadly this is overpowered by what's wrong with the design.

It played fine for me as a 3 and 4 player, but I'm not sure I'd want to play with more. With 3, there's a fair bit of viable look-ahead possible, which means some nice decision making to be made along the way re build-up vs building, and what to sacrifice and what not. It's certainly an odd beast of a game, constantly employing look-ahead in attempts to keep your buildings, and hence your special powers, alive. Well, alive longer than the other players at least. I don't have a feel for how much luck vs strategy plays a part, so I guess some more exploration is in order.

This game has a lot of interesting and unique aspects but is ultimately too random to allow much planning (and thus merit its playtime). 

I'd be happy to play again with 2, as I expect this would mitigate one of the major frustrations, which is that the card draft moves too far between a player's turns in a 4 player game. It's too often the case that a card one wants will be too expensive on one turn, and then off the board the next, making it hard to put together the cool building combos that seem to be the heart of the game. A longer draft line with a more slowly ramping cost a la Through the Ages might also help here.

RATING: 9
Rating after one play with my girlfriend. Lovely board and card artwork, the iconography on each one is reasonably self-explanatory but a flick through the deck to get your head round what they all mean is advised. Quite an unusual game with the Goth threatening to constantly destroy what you have built, we both began to swear at the Goth for demanding so many resources but begrudgingly paid him to keep our stuff but eventually decided I'd had enough of giving him all my resources and he preceded to wipe out everything! Very amusing and trying to figure out if you're going to come out better or worse when the Goth moves is tricky and a big part of the game. Certain cards seem a lot more useful than others, particulary the ones that allow you to move your Roman through either activating the building card or trading a resource to move. Very enjoyable make the best from a bad situation mechanic, don't attempt to go for the big engine because it won't last long, aim small and  try to move your Roman when you can. Looking forward to playing again.

Edit / We've played this one several times now and it's great fun, my girlfriend actually asks to play  and even helped me set up the board! (A first). It really can be agonizing trying to decide whether it's worth not appeasing the Goth, but it will happen sooner or later and you better have a contigency plan or you're going to get wiped out.

RATING: 6
An interesting game, with some resource collection/building purchasing, plus the havoc from the visigoths.  Moves pretty smoothly, with the occasional difficult decision.  The way the Goth works isn't very intuitive, and the game (with 4-players at least) seems to end too soon (distance-wise, not time-wise).  Basically, it feels like Settlers with a race aspect instead of a building one, and has a really nasty robber that you can trigger each round.  Some of the buildings and their advantages are difficult to understand, though.

Also, the players never really improve their position throughout the game.  Your capabilities at the start are the same as at the end, you just may have gathered some different resources in the meantime.  That part is rather unfulfilling.

Three games played, all two player - the first was played until the end but we missed the extremely crucial initial 3-card setup.  It left us with a REALLY bad taste in our mouths and wondering how on earth Rio Grande would release such a thing.  We double checked the rules and realized we played without giving ourselves the initial 3 production cards in our layout, and the second game was played with that in place, making Gloria Mundi much different and quite enjoyable.  

The third game was out of desire to play again, and once again my rating agrees.  Holy smokes, beware of analysis paralysis and make sure you play this with experienced gamers.  Definately not an introduction game.  Great bits, crap packaging.  Remember:  The goths WILL strike, it's just a matter of when.

Update:  I want to like this game.  I do.  But to me, playing this game is like getting punched in the stomach repeatedly. And you've just had a bowl of spaghetti.  With meatballs.  If you're a sadist, it's OK, but for most ---- stop punching me in the stomach.

RATING: 6
Like Pillars, Stone Age and a host of others, this is a building game. Where it stands out is in the Goth/destruction mechanic. All of the other building games are basically group solitaire while Gloria Mundi forces you to watch what your opponents are doing and requires (very often) that you allow the Goths to destroy their builds. For a building game this is fairly complex but the destruction aspects raises this above the rest.

Note: this is not a 'racing game' as some would suggest. The theme implies such but the 'race track' is nothing more than a victory point track.

RATING: 5
Very clever negotiation mechanic that coerces those in the lead to help those who are behind.

However, the game is way too long for what it is (too repetitive with not enough tough decisions). Also, the game is very, very frustrating. There's always a series of improvement cards players can purchase throughout the game. More than half (I believe) can't be purchased because players rarely have enough resources. You just have to be lucky for the right improvement card to be available at the right time. (Or perhaps we were all too greedy and were not able to accumulate resources, I don't know.)

Despite the originality of the negotiation game, I don't have much of a desire to try this game again.

RATING: 7
I bought this at Goodwill for $1.99.  I had not heard of it previously.  It is famous for having a terrible rule book....and difficult to understand icons on the cards.  Personaly, I found the rules to be fine.  the 5 phases are clearly called out.  Most of the cards are intuitive, but a few are difficult and specific examples for each of those cards would be helpful.

The game is basically a racing game.  You try to move from Rome to Africa by building cards.  You put cards in play to secure/convert resources and to move along the path.

At the same time the Goth is moving toward Rome and if you don't pay tribute, he will do a surprising amount of destruction (to you and your opponents) of the economic engine you are trying to put into place.

Great components.  The board is beautiful.  The cards have nice artwork....and nice Roman names.  It's too early to make a good call on where this should be rated.

On one play, I found this game to be engaging and fun.  Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from.  In our game, one player made it to Rome.  We thought the game overstayed its welcome by a little.  The last few turns, we 'powered through' to finish the game.  It was already clear who was going to win.  Although the 2nd player was only 3 spaces out at the end.  Next time we may start 5 or 10 spaces outside of Rome to make it end sooner.  We also started with 6 resources (2 of each) rather than 3 resources which worked well.

Designer has mentioned he working on a new rule set.  One thing that might be worth considering is having a 2 strike rule to destroy buildings.  So the first time the Goth hits your building you put a marker on it, but it's not destroyed until it is hit twice.  This would allow you to get more out of the buildings you put in place.  There can be some frustration with putting a building in place and then having it destroyed before it ever gets activated. ...even once.

Supports 2 to 6 players, and plays within an hour. Economic elements (such as constructing buildings and producing resources, as well as action selection by the active player impacting all others) combine with a race game as players are trying to be the first to flee Rome and reach Africa before the Goth arrives. Bribes may be given to delay his movement, or foregone if facing the ensuing catastrophe hurts others more than oneself. Good value.

Gloria Mundi ressemble fort à un jeu de développement, un genre que je goute tout particulièrement. Il est aussi plutôt réussi, avec ce système original de tribut et destruction (même si le système de récupération du tribut est un peu artificiel et passablement bancal), qui donne un peu de chaos à l'ensemble et l'empêche de devenir excessivement win-to-win.

Un bon jeu donc, malgré quelques défauts : le prix élevé, la grande importance de la relation avec ses voisins de table (si votre voisin de droite décide de ne jamais payer le tribut, ça va être dur de sortir la tête de l'eau), et une symbolique pas toujours claire.

Desire level:  Very high.  Update: Now own, play, and like.  I totally disagree with Dontanville's assertion that there is no progression in the game.  There is a rolling progression as short-term goals change relative to commodities on hand.  Controlling that progression in face of the Gothic depredations makes for a pretty compelling game.  Also, I really don't think Gloria Mundi is somehow Ernest's cynical commentary on Euros.  This game is somewhat susceptible to analysis paralysis, but works very well with two, and comes with a beautiful board and nice components.

The mechanic of this game makes it difficult to control the outcome.  There is so much going on with every choice, everything is so interwoven, that strategy is hindered in my opinion.  Played with a large group your choices are so limited by your starting cards that you might as well concede that you have no control whatsoever.

I guess it boils down to me that it's too long and too dry to not have a better tactical element.  Mediocre.

Economic, Building. Enjoyed this. Technically, it is very well designed with some cool mechanics, but I can see why some people are turned off by the theme and the way the Goths are continually threatening and then destroying your holdings. I'd like to play it a few more times to solidify my rating.

Update: got a cheap copy and played it again, but with 6p this time. Not a great experience. Well, my game was okay, but one player was brutally sodomized for about the last 75% of the game. Reading up on it, I agree with one problem card in particular and the number of players. I'd really like to play this again with exactly 3p, where I think it will shine. Otherwise, I'll have to lower my rating a bit.

RATING: 2
Oof.  Like many of James Ernest's games, there is one good idea included in every design. Gloria Mundi is no exception.  The deck/resource management system makes you think you are going to be playing something really clever.  While his games aren't always particularly clever, but they do have a charm about them.  Gloria Mundi has no charm, and because of the rest of the system, everything clever about the deck/resource management gets drowned out entirely.  I kept looking back in the box to see if we forgot to unpack the fun, nope there is no fun in this box.

I blame most of this on the Goth.  In the game you are always attempting to appease the Goth, everyone knows that you can never make a Goth happy.  The goal of the game is to move your piece up the scoring track that is supposed to be Italy.  In order to do so you must produce resources to buy building cards, in order to buy building cards you must have production cards.  The way the Goth works is that he takes away your production cards. So while it could be fun to build buildings with special powers, often you are setting up buildings only to move yourself forward on the track.  Now I like many Euros that have you collect resources to turn them in for VPs (Keythedral, Settlers, etc) but I don't feel that there is an overwhelming sense of competition for resources and then this gives you the illusion that you are going to get something else with your attainments which is often just taken away from you from others not paying tribute to the Goth.  

There are ways around this, but they aren't particularly enjoyable, you can set yourself up to invest heavily in one color which makes progress slower or you can take what is otherwise a game with rapid turns and math the reprocussions and permutations evaluating what the results of not giving Tribute to the Goth entails.  Often the tribute to the Goth maths out to obvious results (Good/Bad) so it makes it "worth" taking the time to examine it each turn.  The thing is you aren't just mathing out this turn, you are mathing out what the next players potential will be and the next player after that and right on down the line.  Then of course you are still subject to the caprice of other players who decide "well it may not be the best move, but let's do it anyway" or a Geschenkt scenario where they don't have the goods to pass to the next player (which you can't know because their goods are behind screens).

So after getting frustrated at setting myself up with buildings I realized that this is a linear racing game, and while it is nice to get a little leg up from the buildings, you ultimately want to keep moving forward, so just buy what you can and keep moving forward, which strips anything that was previously interesting out of the game.

There is no real progression to the game, you don't ever really better your positions, most of this is inane repetition, with the math of how to screw other players as the only competition.  It is as if James Ernest decided that he wanted to prove that all Euros were dry, resource management games where theme ultimately meant nothing other than to attain VPs.  The only reason why I gave this a 2.5 is that I want to believe that was his intention, and that this is the Showgirls of boardgames.

It's been a while since I played this one.  I can only remember that the board in pretty and that the best part of this game is the wronkage incurred by not agreeing to make the sacrifice.  Not quite enough interesting decisions to elevate this game's rating any higher (as that would have made it more memorable for me).

UPDATE: Just got this on the table again, and there are some delightful decisions in trying to manage your dwindling resources.  A quality game that is definitely underrated.

UPDATE #2: Played this recently and no one gave tribute through the first couple of rounds.  As a result, no one got their engine going, and the game stagnated and was really not fun.  Need to play again to see if this game should go lower or higher in the rating, or maybe sit where it is.

Nice idea and theme but the game is not that balanced. From one side it's too "mechanic" so the best move is often really obvious and from the other side you can be hurt so badly by other players random choices that can be really frustrating. 
It's a real pity, because the basic idea was so good.

First impression after a 2-player game: I was leading the whole game due to my opponent's poor choices in the first rounds. There was no way he was going to catch up, so the rest of the game felt a bit pointless. Have to play with more players to see, if it feels different. I'm hopeful though, maybe this game is just a bit harsh on n00bs.

Second impression; it happened again, but now much later in the game. This game punishes you for mistakes that's for sure. I somewhat like it though. It's so different from all the other games I've played, even though resource management and building cards don't sound so different. Game is short enough for what it is and stays interesting and tight.

This game is about making the best tactical choice on your turn in order to take steps towards Carthago. If you try to keep up with a long term strategy, your opponents will let Goth destroy your plans. Definitely not your normal engine building game, although it helps if you can manage to build even the tiniest engine for a few rounds.

Update: feels different with four players. More planning and thinking involved. Rating with 2 players would be much lower.

(played with 5, if that makes a difference) I could give a really long explaination for why this game is bad and what I think is wrong with it. But it's taken some valued time out of my life just playing the stupid thing and ranting about how bad it was to some other people in real life. I don't want to waste any more of my time thinking or talking about this bad bad game.

Updated - with 4 the game is more chaotic.

Interesting mostly-card game. The race is to build & develop your farms, cities and legions and then to use them to move toward Africa. The player interaction is mostly done through the Goth.

Unable to rate after first game, need to play more. I think we got it right ruleswise, but maybe our playing style wasn't very good - building cards just whizzed past without anyone able to afford them, and it seemed impossible to have any kind of strategy when no cards seemed to last for more than 1 round.

I had a lot of fun with this one. The theme is fun and the decisions are tough. One quibble is that decisions by other players about whether to pay tribute or allow the visigoths to advance can hose those closest to them in turn order, and sitting to the left of a bad decision-maker can ruin your chances to compete. With players of equal ability, though, this one shines.

The rules are confusing, & it falls short in other areas. We had a sense of very little control. The people who go later & last in the game are in a hole that seems impossible to get out of. Every turn seemed painful. There seems to be a good game in there somewhere, but it needs an overhaul.

Rated after two plays.  I doubt I'll play again.

It feels like there should be something here, but I'm not sure what it is.  By the end of the game, it felt like I had no options left.  There also appears to be a serious runaway leader problem.

Great game with very interesting mechanics. The objective of the game is to flee and destroy your empire in a creative way that will allow you to succeed. In most game, you build your empire. In this game, you have to find the best way to destroy it. Some people may not like this idea, but this is also what makes it a good game.

I was told that this wasn't a type of game that I would enjoy and then immediately afterward told this was the game we were going to play. So I went into the game with some misgivings. And I see what they were getting at... I usually don't love the "things you build can get destroyed" mechanic. Especially when it's based on other players targeting you.

However, it's mitigated in this game as you can see what things are at risk, and you can tell when you're likely to be affected or not. And building the same things as the person to the right of you lessens the risk to you somewhat. But I can still see the potential for this game to just knock you down hard. One player in our game got off to an early lead, but then had everything he built ripped away from him. He spent the rest of the game only being able to build up a building or two before they got knocked down as well.

I liked the game though. It's got some interesting choices about whether you follow other people's leads or not, timing on when you play the cards in your hand (as you have limited choices of each of the three lands you build), whether to pay tribute or not (and how that screws other players) and what buildings to build.

Interesting design. There is no luck (even in setup) other than what shows up in the building card market. The game is very tactical and AP-prone. The mechanisms are such that if you mess up any step of your ply analysis, you quite likely end up with a bad move. It's impossible to approximate the best move and have confidence that if your analysis is slightly off, the result too is only slightly off from what you expected. Similarly trying to play by gut is pretty much no better than making random moves. Ply analysis seems to be the only way to play. I don't really care for that.

On the plus side, it's very interactive (without really being a "take-that" game), and the questions asked of players tend to have very concrete repercussions, making ply analysis much less futile than it might be. You aren't overloaded with options.

Actually, with familiarity play can proceed pretty quickly. I felt speed bumps mainly in needing to shift the card market every turn, which chafed me because it seemed like usually nobody was in a position to buy anything. The market regenerates unnecessarily quickly/constantly. When you are able to buy something, usually you can find something good in what's available, but the ability you get may be arbitrary (especially if you're more interested in getting the movement bonus of the card). I am unsure how much effect the market's randomness has on the game overall.

While the game's central idea is interesting (i.e. your buildings, constructed euro-style, keep getting destroyed by a mechanism controlled by the players) it seems to cause also a lack of a feeling of progression. It seems that often your stuff gets destroyed and you must start again from square one.

Post by user diamondspider:
"What is unique about this game, as far as I can see, is that nearly every choice a player makes will have a directly and usually substantial impact on several other players.

This goes for both good and bad impacts. I might be in a place I need to play a Legio, but that will help 2 other players more than me! I might also decide not to pay tribute and hurt myself a little to hurt others a lot.

It is not common in games to have so much impact each and every move. Indeed, if you like both your fate and the fates of others to be almost on the whim of each player, this game is not only good at that, I cannot think of many other games that have this heavy of an impact dynamic!"

There is nothing you can build that the goth cannot take away. You get to build one thing a turn. The goth, on average, destroys just less than one thing a turn per player. That means on average, you are left with just about nothing. It's hard to gain much of an edge, or distinguish yourself too much. It was a very brutal one play so far, and I imagine even if we tributed more, it would be just as brutal.

Much too long for what it is. The game is very repetitive. It just cycles between building and destroying without the feeling that you're going anywhere. Although the decision to refuse to pay tribute (i.e. the decision to destroy buildings) is a tactical opportunity, it isn't sufficient to make the game interesting. However, there is a good game hiding in there.

alright game;  has much greater potential that was somehow not fully translated into the game flow -- I believe a lot of this problem lies in what flops in the market to be bought and when -- some of it can be impossible to buy or help you in any way; depending on the group you play with it might be alright -- with the wrong group it will NOT work out in ANY way;  regardless, it's kind of unbalanced at times and I (and everyone else I've played with) thinks it needs a bit of a fix to even it out and make it a little more forgiving and fair to all;  if you like lots of damage and want to see your stuff that you built get destroyed easily then this is the game for you; artwork is awesome in this game -- top marks to that aspect for sure

Fall of Rome theme.  Strategy boardgame.

A seriously underated game.  Plays best with fewer players in my opinion.  The two times I have played it with four, the game seems a little more random.  I would like to try a few more four player games to see if different tactics would work better.

As a 2 player game, Gloria Mundi becomes a tight, exciting game with lots of decisions and a relatively fast playing time (1 hour tops).

3 player is fun as well.

This game is very unconventional.  Imagine Ra, with 5 times as many disasters, and they have to be taken by some player.  This game seems to accelerate, but destruction accelerates as well.  If you play it with the right group, it is a lot of fun.  

If you don't like seeing your work destroyed, then this isn't for you.

Man, I want to like this game SO BAD.  Theme?  Fantastic.  Components?  Top-notch.  Mechanics?  Very intriguing.  But as a whole?  It, uh, has some issues.  My judgment is based on one game with four players, with at least one small rule wrong, so it's certainly possible that it can be better.  The chaos was very difficult to deal with, and long-term planning did not seem feasible.  There's too much riding on what buildings come up, and even when good buildings come up, there's nothing that says that you'll have the appropriate setup to buy and use those buildings.  Bribing the goth is an interesting mechanic, but it devolves into a lot of gamey shenanigans just to make sure that you don't get hit, but can still take a good.  The game as a whole reminds me of [gameid=31594], with the long-term planning taken out and the luck factor ratcheted up threefold.  I want to try it one more time, to give this game a chance to redeem itself, but this one's looking like a big old crash and burn.

[Played 2 times]
A classic "gather resources to convert them into buildings having special properties to get more resources and victory points" game. Unfortunately marred by semi-random screwage and constant loss of what you've done.
Decisions feeel often constrained and obvious.
The cards doesn't seem well balanced at all.
May be decent with just two players (more control and no "collateral damage"). 
With several players, downtime is unbearable.
The rulebook could have been done better.
Random, repetitive, unsatisfying. Disappointing, especially after such a long wait (it was delayed for more than a year).

A very good game but you really need to pay attention to what the other players are doing.  If you try to plan a strategy while ignoring what's going on to your right and left, you probably won't do well.  The publication of this game went long overdue but it's worth getting.

Clever game.  Lots of pretty bits,  although the resource bits are a bit small,  and the gold is brown :P  Tricky game,  that involves being careful to remember to switch from resource production to points generation....and watch out for Goth screwage!  Lots of fun,  but ran pretty long for our 5 player game.  Thinking about it,  the board is pretty excessive - half of the board is really just a glorified scoring track,  and the other half of the board is also a track (with resources for the Goth to pillage).

All of the things that others say about this game being a train wreck are generally true.  There aren't too many interesting decisions in this game.  You don't seem to have that much control over what you do, because the cards are so randomly distributed and because everything you build is subject to being destroyed by the Goth, over whom you have absolutely no control.  Also, it seems a bit tedious and long for what it is.  I agree with the general comment shared by many that the fun has been totally sucked out of this one.

Gloria Mundi is interesting in the same sense that Terra is interesting.  Both games are semi-cooperative, which means that people who can't (or won't) cooperate for the good of the group will cause the game to degenerate into a self-destructive whirlpool of hate and anger.

These types of games are psychological personality tests more than anything else - and, frankly, I'm amused by the whole thing.  It's funny to watch people refuse to cooperate, and then cause the game to blow up.

Regardless, this game could have used more playtesting.  Early-,mid-,and late-game decks would have been a good idea, for starters.

Played once (with 5 players). I enjoyed this game much more than I thought I would. The decisions do not seem to be straightforward, there are interesting choices, and the material is rather nice (although the player tokens are a bit unusual). It might be a bit long, but no one had played before (and I suspect it would be shorter with fewer players). I'm definitely looking forward to further plays, and will buy it once I have confirmed that positive first impression.

More plays might increase my rating. Problems include poor rules, obtuse card powers and iconography, and card power distribution. The nature of game seems very dependent on when or if certain cards come out. Getting a goods to VP card early can generate a large lead for someone. I am not sure if the Goths can be controlled to your advantage or if it is largely random in the end. 5P seemed to increase the problems inherent in the design. I would like to try with 3.

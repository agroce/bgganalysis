lighter than leonardo da vinci, but plays more smoothly (at least if you take out the events / prune out the more drastic ones)

Fun, semi-light, quick. 

After more plays and watching other people play I'm a bit concerned that the first and mostly second player at the start of the game have some advantage. In the first 2-3 turns it seems to be better to be the starting player (it's easier to get more workers) and in the next ones it's better to be last. So the first and second player at the start of the game begin the turn when it is good to begin it and end it when it is good to end them.

Solid mix of worker placement, area control, and just a titch of co-op.  I like it, the theme really shines, you feel like you're building up armies for a big battle.  The mechanics make sense with the theme, and the combination seems quite unique.  You essentially can steal worker placement spots by bidding more resource than the previous placements.  So if you really want something, you can usually get it even if you're the last player.  It'll likely just cost you more.  Nice game.  And my last name is Poniatowski, so I had to have this.  :)

Meh. Waste of time and money. Boring worker placement with history build-in. Beating dead horse again.

A fine combination of bluffing, worker placement and majority control that plays in less than an hour and is accessible to kids and non-gamers as well. I don't know if after a few month someone outside Poland will play it. But it has a theme appealing to me and my family likes it so what's more to expect from a game? :-)

Definitely worth trying.

Light area influence game with very unintuitive rules of placing your meeples. Just OK but nothing more.
A pity the pigs are smiling (this idea was probably taken from Hazienda) while the knights have real historical feel. And the title is silly, from historical point of view. The battle of Grunwald just occured during the war campaing, nobody was planning it earlier, what is suggested by the title.

Very good eurogame.  The best Polish game of 2010.

In theory it's just another standard worker placement euro, but somehow it stands out of the crowd.  I can write about the tension, fierce competition and elegant rules, but I can't really describe the winning formula here.  It just exists :)

It's NOT a game about the battle. It's an auction based game about gathering resources and using them to win VPs. Very engaging and with lots of interaction.

I saw this for sale in Wawel Castle so I kinda had to buy it.  Gave it a play and I enjoyed it, but one of the weaker games in my collection.

2015.06.22 Have played this twice as 2-player. The rules are fairly simple and we only made some minor mistakes in our first game, which turned out to be very lopsided due to the advantage of the three bonus tokens (I won all three outright). The second game was much more tight.

My only request about the rules would be some more explanation of the event cards, since it's not clear what happens sometimes with ties, or whether you can play the farmer when an event card asks for knights (and if so, what happens if everyone plays farmers?). The English rules on this site are a great translation, with most of the ambiguity coming from the original.

The game itself is a mix of light cooperation, worker placement and simple collection of points, with some of those points having to be "sacrificed" occasionally when cooperation fails. I definitely enjoyed the dynamic created by the Teutonic Knight attacks.

In the 2-player game, it seems like the first player gets a big advantage because they can force it that they alone collect new helpers on the first and second turns, without it costing them too dearly. Yet, somehow the second game still ended up close, so I guess it eventually evened out. The 2-player game also felt fairly deterministic, with most of the moves predetermined because any "wait" moves could be done by your opponent too. As a result, the game was getting dry by the second time around. Too bad, but I also feel like having just one more player could significantly spice up the dynamic and make this a great game. Holding out some hope.

Played one 2p game. Light eurogame, could be better for more players. Seems nice to introduce kids to worker placement and/or area control.

I could have rated it higher (about 7.5) if it wasn't for the lack of originality. Typical worker placement / area majority game.Great artwork though and good as an educational game about Poland's history. Relatively fast play is also an advantage.

Not so good with 2 people, but still a decent crossbreed of worker placement and auctioning mechanics.

Stunning artwork & stunning game.Also a superb worker placement game with plenty of tough choices for the players.
I can really appreciate how well designed this game is.
I also love playing it, even though I am absolutely shit at it.

Very nice strategic management game. I am becoming a fan of Filip Milunski's design approach. Fast, simple but with choices to be made. Gives a feel of the overall strategic management of your resources to fight the evil Teutonic Knights without getting sucked into analysis paralysis. A relatively light feel with a nice feel for the theme.

I thought this was great, Worker Placements are a fave and this is right  up there for that feeling of just wanting one more option.
Lots of unusual stuff here, the semi co-operative aspect of fending off the Teutons (or, selling out your country for your own gain - how many WPs have that sort of integration of theme?); the allocation of workers with the boss being worth more but only being able to top up in certain circumstances.
The theme really fits well, tying in to the history and you have the feeling of carrying out the tasks the game sets you.
It's a shame this won't get more attention, but for me it could well be a hidden gem

Worker placement meets area majority. Only played a 2p game, which I really enjoyed. Short and quick, yet with some interesting bluffing going on while making your decisions.

Playtested (about 5 games?) in February 2010.

Surprisingly good and interesting worker-placement game: easy-to-learn, with some calculating & moves' optimization, hand managing, few strategies to win and with a tiny bit of cooperation.

I can't wait for my copy.

RATING: 7
Like all good push your luck games, this game can be completely unfair.  But that's ok!  I really love the idea that you can take your turn to continue off where the previous player chickened out.  I think more push your luck games will do that in the future.

A rabbit themed push your luck dice game. Plays like Pickomino with a lot more chance for amazing luck or devastating losses. Uses multiplication and addition and any dice a player chooses not to select for their current score is open for the next player to take a risk and build off that same score. Very interesting decisions, I bet this one is great with two players.

Finally played this gem that was gifted to me by a generous geek.  Oh. My. God.  What a wonderful, fun, and exciting dice game.  Played 2-player with my daughter.  We absolutely loved it!  Fun, fun, fun!!

Initial rating:  9

Played 3-player with Mamadallama and her husband.  Lots of fun!!  Rating remains a 9.

Game is fast and fun at all player counts.  New players absolutely love this game.

Rating remains at 9.

21/07/12 A funny light-hearted filler - essentially you are rolling dice with pictures of rabbits and hutches and you depending on the combinations you roll, keep some and re-roll others as long as you get a rabbit on each roll you are fine. However, 50:50 chances seem to go against you a disproportionate number of times but the table talk his hilarious. Put me in a good mood for other games on an Epsom Games Day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Did I only play dice rollers today? Overly complex rules to a simple rabbit housing game. Hares x hutches equals score. Seemed more confusing than it needed to be, and didn't add anything to the genre. Pickomino is a better game for the same effort.

A surprisingly fun press your luck dice game with a rabbit keeping theme. It has very good tension. I love that you can get dice back to keep your going if you manage to use all the dice once and also that you can choose to continue playing someone else's turn after they choose to stop. It probably does have a few too many rules/exceptions to fully appeal to the light gaming crowd that the theme implies, though, and the fact that you're ultimately just playing to get the most points is a little anticlimactic (especially since the official point total target is 333 points which seems to be almost randomly chosen because it sounded funny and tends to drag the game out longer than it should be).

The number of times I am passed one die with a 50/50 chance of taking the score forward and yet fail each time. Deeply frustrating. Maybe pushing my luck is not for me?

But game is a lot of fun, a lovely light 10 - 20 minute filler with lots of groans and moaning, playable by all ages.

verjaardag papa (papa, Ward, ik), 120606. Vrij kort en leuk dobbelspelletje, waarbij je moet gokken om je punten te houden, of door te spelen (met het risico alle punten te verliezen). Als je niet doorspeelt, mag de volgende speler echter kiezen dat wel te doen, waardoor hij kans maakt ook van jouw punten te profiteren.

This is a very simple push your luck dice game with some amazing twists that lead to hugely fun moments as a singe die is cast for bunny glory!

The game is all about multiplicative scoring (bunny love). The dice can roll bunnies or bunny hutches. You need to lock away at least one bunny each roll or you bust. You can also make progress on a singe bunny hutch which must start as size 2 and can increase at most one step per roll until it is size 5. If you choose to stop you record your score which is the number of bunnies multiplied by the size of your hutch.

There are two cool twists that make the game shine. The first is that if you manage to roll all the dice successfully, you bank the bunnies you have, pick up all the dice showing bunnies and continue rolling. This means that the theoretical high score for a single turn is infinite which happens with probability approaching zero. You'd be crazy not to continue rolling with odds like those!

The other twist is that if you stop and record your score your left neighbor can take over from where you left things. This counts as their turn, but with a little luck they can capitalize on all of your good luck.

This leads to lots of excitement and stand up and roll moments which are hilarious and fun (real fun, not my style of mind crushing fun).

It doesn't hurt that I've recently rescued a little bunny, who as I type this is flopped down near my feet. So all things bunny hit a little closer to my soft spot for this little guy

Please, no more 'dry' dice rolling games... just a box with a handful of dice and a sheet of rules is NOT a game... at least not for me.

RATING: 6
A push-your-luck dice game in the same vein as Can't Stop. The new element is that you can take up on the rolls of your opponent if he choose to stop rolling. Compared to Pickomino (the only other dice game from the series that I know) I like this one better as it plays faster while Pickomino can drag a bit. But it hinges too much on one or two successful high stake rolls to get a better rating.

A simple game, largely based on luck. However, even after a few years we keep coming back to it, both with the kids and with the bi-yearly board game group. There is a certain hypnotic quality to the repeated exclamations: "Rabbit!", "Two Rabbits in a Cage!", etc.

The majority of turns you get a low score, or you go bust, but just often enough the scores suddenly sky-rocket, and because the next player can always continue where the last player left off your standing in the game is very unpredictable

Perfect opener, late closer or to play with kids. Highly recommended

The rules are much too fiddly for a simple dice game.  The rulebook was not well or logically laid out imo.

Ok - I tried again with a different mindset and played it two players with my girlfriend.  The game played relatively quickly and it made sense.

Kind of fun - a neat filler.  I love Doris M.'s artwork!!

Dice games can be pretty cool (Ten Thousand, Chicago...), but not this one. There's some gambling in that shallow, abstract game, which is a bit entertaining. Apart from that, it's boring. I have probably outgrown its target group, so that may explain why I have no real desire for playing this. However, I think it's simply bad.

Still is a fun game. And even after 4 got 5 turn away in the game, a 5th player can pick up and even win.
A game where one never can stand being greedy !

Hoppladi Hopplada! -- 

Played three- and four-player.

Yes, it's like many other Yahtzee-mechanic light dice games.
Yes, it's rather complex for something so light.

Yet it's worth it. The ability to temporarily "lock" scores and build on them by bringing used Hare dice back into play introduces lots of potential for greedy, greedy players.

And of course there is the fear/hope response when a player is deciding to end his turn. Fear on the part of the active player that he's setting up the next player for an even better score. Hope on the part of the next player that if he just rolls the right symbol(s) he'll build on the previous player's score.

Lots of noise when the long shot is risked and pays off.

This dice game has a great premise. You get to take the risks, the previous player did not dare to take. You either win big, or lose everything. This is a really fun feature. It also makes me not care about every other player, except the one to my right. This game has no screw you element like Pickomino and Sushizock im Gockelwok and therefore I rate it lower.

This is a fantastic dice roller, which we both loved it. The rules were confusing at first,  even though there aren't many. It could really do to have a flow chart summary page,  which I may have a go at producing, if I can't find one here on BGG.

Addictive little dice game. It's push your luck with a gambling element. Stop too early, and your opponent might rake in the big points. Stop too late and you risk losing it all. Quite good, but not with large crowds.

I played it once and I like it and I will play it often.
You need a lot of luck to win. But you don´t have to risk a lot if you are satisfied with collecting less winning points. But it is a lot more fun playing hazardous. Not a new type of game, just a new nice theme.

[Zoch 08 edition] {Animal; dice-rolling, luck-pressing; optimal 3-4p} Hoppladi Hoppladi is a pure dice game.  Dice luck is the major factor in this game, very limited decisions.  The decisions here are which dice to keep, whether to continue or not, and whether to keep the previous player's dice.  But the decisions are usully trivial.  No direct player interaction - one cannot steal dice or score from another player.  However, there is an indirect interaction that you may leave a good "hand" for the following player.  Yet, it is short enough to be a fun filler.  No regret to own it.

The multiplication would turn off young players, but the calculation is usually simple.

I like the dice.  They are large and nicely illustrated, even though the 7 dice are the same.

The secret sauce for this lightweight PYL game is definitely being able to resume the previous player's turn. Will *you* take that risky roll that your opponent passed up on? Who knows, you might win big!

Unfortunately the math on this is a bit too sharp: busting feels more common than not, though given the exponentially increasing scoring I think it needs that edge to drive home the risk.

Hoppladi Hopplada! is a push-your-luck dice game, with the fun option of continuing your opponent's roll when they decide to be prudent, and not tempt fate any further. The game fits perfectly into the small dice game line from Zoch, alongside Dr. Knizia's Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck, and Sushizock im Gockelwok, Hoppladi Hopplada! is definitely a game much more fun than the sum of its parts. It is actually helped, in my circles, by constant jokes about bunnies making babies, being homeless, or living by the dozens in small apartments.

The additional gambling element, on top of a regular push-your-luck game, where you can pick up where your opponent was too afraid to continue is so over the top addictive, and tons of fun. This game is filled with laughter, hoots and hollering, groaning and complaints about the lack of rabbits on the dice, but people keep rolling and pushing their luck because you can actually win the entire game with one amazing roll of the dice (and an equally amazing amount of luck).

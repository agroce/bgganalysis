Fun! It was neat to finally play this after knowing Ticket to Ride pretty well... seeing how that game must have evolved out of this one is neat. It's not really worth the inflated eBay prices though... I really hope Alan releases his new version soon. We played a variant where you can never run out of UP shares, which is something I encourage everyone to try. UPDATE: a later play fell flat. I am no longer as intrigued, and since I have now played Gloria Picktoria (Get the Goods) I no longer feel the need to own this game.

Generally under-rated game which is great fun with six players.

RATING: 7
5 plays / 4,5,6 players.

LIKE: The mechanism of the dividend card is fun, a looming unknown when it will pop up. interesting how people gradually teamed up in colors, but once in a while a few takeovers emerged. 
DISLIKE: Easy to fall behind. Game was a little long with 6. Very strong to get UP stock, seems a tad overpowered.

OVERALL: It's very fun once the strategies appear. TIP: Get the UP stock!

Railroad themed cousin to Acquire. This is a great game. It accomadates a good range of players (although 2 player isn't as satisfying) and is easy to explain. Beginners can pick up play quickly. There is depth here also although it might take several playings to work out some of the more successful strategies.

Fantastic.  Now to find a copy...

Revision after a couple of more plays:

The game itself has an interesting mechanic, but now that I have a lot more game playing experience I see the Union Pacific stocks as being broken in the game.  Initial turn order will determine how many of these cards you can obtain and these cards are huge for scoring.

I'll play it again, but only if the UP cards are set aside.

Lowered my rating from an 8 to a 6.

I'm really glad to have this game. I picked up a couple RRG copies of this in 2002 or so, but ended up turning them around for $60 or so at the time because it was going out of print and I was wanting to pick up some other things. 

Somehow I found another copy of this on the shelf of a comic shop nearly 2 years later. Unfortunately. it was missing one of its paper cash ($1 Million Dollars!) so I contacted Jay, and even though the game had been out of print for maybe over 2 years at that point, he still sent me the missing loot without hassle. I even played this with my parents once and have a great memory of that game session as it was their first introduction to a more complicated and involving game.

This one will never leave the collection as it will never be reprinted, and I just like the game.

A great investment game with a railroad theme.

Much simpler than any game of the 18xx series (it's not even comparable) and more fun than Chicago Express.
Rules for investing in the many different companies, building links and receiving dividends are very straightforward and easy for newbies to grasp and start playing smartly.

The components are very nice. Visually, it looks like Ticket to Ride with money. Gameplay-wise it feels like a marriage of Acquire and Chicago Express. 

But it is actually quite deeper on the strategic thinking than Acquire and more fun in building up the right company and trying to stay in the stock controlling group of the best ones than Chicago Express.

In my opinion, it is a game with easy rules and a good amount of long term strategy building and tactical, opportunistic gameplay. 

It packs quite a lot of fun and it can be played in less than 2 hours.

Simple rules, great decisions, fun random scoring element.  I prefer random scoring cards instead of deck-seeding, and only allowing trades to acquire up stock.  I'm not decided on limited vs unlimited up shares.  The board doesn't seem too relevant when you're playing it, but it seemed hollow as a strict card game when playing its sibling, Get the Goods.  I'm always willing to play, and would love to see a new edition just to replace the old art/cards.  Update: really disliked Airlines Europe and its money system.

A relative of and often compared to Acquire.  It is a solid game with nice production and easy to teach rules.  For some unknown reason, I don't find it as enjoyable as Acquire.

Very clever and well designed game.  Much simpler than I thought it was going to be, and can be quickly taught.  It think that it deserves the solid reputation that it's earned.

I think that with more players, the UP stock becomes more important.

Scales very well to 6 players with minimal down time.  Highly recommended for 6 players.

I only recently discovered this game and I love it. It's fast paced, has simple rules and with the right group of gamers is a LOT of fun. I own the German edition, but apart from the rules and the box, all the text is in English. Rules translations are available from the Amigospiele website, so getting the German edition (which at this time is the only one available new) is just fine.

Fair game.
The comparisons to Acquire are appropriate.  This game does have a very similar feel to that game.

I felt something missing as I was playing, though, and I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was.

The downtime during the game was very evident.

A good game, but not great.

Kíváncsi voltam, mivel kevesebb ez, mint az Airlines Europe. Hát nem sokkal. Amott kicsit kidolgozottabb a társaságok értékének nyilvántartása, nem kell mindig megszámolni. És az Airlines-nál vannak lehetséges bónuszok bizonyos társaságoknál, az itt hiányzik. Emellett a Union Pacific részvény megszerzési mechanizmusa más. Nekem élményben kb. ugyanazt adta, szóval a másikat tök felesleges megvenni e mellé.

A good light train-stockholding game that manifests almost all 18XX basic strategies: shares, blocking, bluff. It does not have the economic element. It can be used either as a normal euro game, or as an introductory game to 18XX. Mind you, the game has robust strategies and takes about 1.5 hours to play, but can be explained in under 2 minutes. Another nice but different game in this category is Wallace's Steel Driver which I also enjoyed.

[i]Posted: 5/14/06, Rated: 10[/i]

I arrived at [i]Union Pacific[/i] after having fallen in love with [i][gameid=9209][/i].  Yes, yes, I know that [i]Union Pacific[/i] is a re-release of an earlier game.  I never played [i][gameid=43][/i].  I also acknowledge that I'm probably drawing some structurally unsound conclusions by saying that several parts of [i][gameid=9209][/i] were inherited from [i]Union Pacific:[/i] the little plastic trains, the similar map with marked spaces, a limited number of routes between cities, card "drafting" in the form of having four face-up cards in addition to the face-down deck.  To me, [i]Union Pacific[/i] feels like [url=http://www.geekdo.com/boardgamedesigner/9/alan-r-moon]Alan R. Moon's[/url] first attempt to refine the formula that would eventually lead to winning the [i]Spiel des Jahres[/i] with [i][gameid=9209][/i].

[i]Union Pacific[/i] is by far the more strategically-challenging game.  And where [i][gameid=9209][/i] can be confrontational, [i]Union Pacific[/i] can foster a sense of pure r{[b]betrayal[/b]}r.  Do I go for a majority shareholding position in a single, giant railroad?  Should I opt for seeking out uncontested dominance in smaller companies?

Should I let someone else build a behemoth, all the while collecting the shares I need to steal it out from under her?  [i]Delicious.[/i]

The game board offers another interesting challenge: reaching a strategic junction can make a big difference in a railroad's ability to grow.  Collecting the proper track cards to foster that growth is also important.  All of these decisions are intertwined beautifully.

Every person (read: non-hardcore gamer) with whom I have shared [i][gameid=9209][/i] has loved it.  That fact combined with its easy, colorful gameplay earned it a score of "10."  However, I like [i]Union Pacific[/i] better, even though it is not as accessible.  I love to play them both, but I'd secretly prefer to pull out [i]Union Pacific[/i] first.


[i]Updated: 12/24/09, Rated: 10[/i]

[i][gameid=9209][/i] has been taken down a notch.  [i]Union Pacific[/i] now stands alone as the superior [url=http://www.geekdo.com/boardgamedesigner/9/alan-r-moon]Alan R. Moon[/url] train game I believe it to be!


[i]Updated: 2/6/15, Rated: 8[/i]

Five years later, the luster has faded from [i]Union Pacific[/i].  As a train-and-stock game, it feels flat in comparison to the 18xx series of games ([i][thing=17405][/thing][/i] in particular).  During a dividend round, you don't get paid for each of your shares.  Share prices can't fall, although the potential value of your set can increase as the railroad builds more connections.  The ability to invest many shares of the same stock at one turn can be disconcerting.

I still enjoy [i]Union Pacific[/i], but now I see the randomness of share draws being a limitation instead of a benefit.  And in that light, I think that [i][gameid=9209][/i] is now the better game between the two.

Reminds me a little of Acquire and a little bit of Ticket To Ride. Definitely a "next step" game from a gateway like Ticket To Ride.

On a turn you draw a track card. Then you either claim a track for company by using a track card or you invest in some stock. When you invest in stock you may lay down 1 stock each of two companies or an unlimited amount of stock for just one company. If you claim track, you then get to draw one of the four face up cards or a face down stock from the stock pile. You can then trade an uninvested stock from you hand for a single Union Pacific stock. If instead you invest, then discard on of your track cards so that you end your turn with three track cards. You then end your turn.

Four times throughout the game someone is going to lay track and then draw a scoring card. When they do, the game stops and players get to collect money according to their stock holdings. Players earn money if they hold the most and/or second most stock of a company. On all but the first of the four scoring rounds players will earn money for holding the most through the fifth most of Union Pacific stock.

Played once with six players, once with four. Nice!  Lots of angst on your turn, about whether to expand a company you have stock in, or increase your ownership in that or other companies.  Me likey.

The limit on Union Pacific cards is a problem if you play with 4 or 5 players.  If you don't play optimally at the beginning, you won't have your share of shares (ahem) and you'll get hurt badly every scoring round.  And yet, if everyone plays well and gets the most shares they can, it's a complete wash as everyone will have the same number.  You should be able to invest in Union Pacific throughout the game, in my opinion, so players are able to recover from poor early decisions.

This does not affect my very favourable rating for the game, and I look forward to a future reprint that will hopefully address this issue.

Nice stock game.  It has the tension of Acquire...a true head rubbing game.  You never know when that scoring card is going to come so you sweat out the details of laying down more shares or grabbing that sweet share staring at you.  Played with the regular UP rules and will likely to continue to.  It seems like if you went unlimited UP shares, the game would go on and on.  Also, if you could only get shares by trashing a share, I see the same thing happening.  You just better be on it, or try to get the jump in other areas.

Kövezzetek meg, de ez egy nagy kedvencem :) Nagyon kedvelem az olyan játékokat, mely azon a döntésen alapul, hogy most kevesebbet vagy később többet, de akkor lehet hogy mégis kevesebbet. Szóval a kiértékelések ciklikus változása számomra igazán szórakoztató. A részvények gyűjtésével a versengés nem feltétlenül a monopóliumot jelenti, hanem lehet, hogy a sok kicsi sokra megy alapon nyerhető meg a játék. Aztán hirtelen valaki vesz egy halom részvényt és borul az elmélet :)

UPDATE: Having played Union Pacific some more I still believe it's a good game but not a great game.  The game really fails the depth/length tradeoff being far too long for a game with a lot of obvious decisions.  Almost the entirety of the game is deciding which stocks to collect, but there is a lot of other stuff built on top that feels perfunctory.  I mean, lets be honest, the board is mostly superfluous, picking a train to put down is easy and there isn't that much opportunity for blocking.  But I think what annoys me the most about the game is that for a stock game the stock draw gets clogged far too easily.  Most of the strategy in the game is lost if people are forced to draw face down stocks; at that point it's coming down to luck.  So good, but not great.

I once doubted the quality of Union Pacific after my initial play.  Nevertheless, respected Geeks expounded the exceptional nature of the game.  I pulled the trigger on a copy from Funagain and I don't regret it.  My family instantly fell in love and I quickly reanalyzed my feelings towards the game.  The vital element to the game is the time crunch.  Other games employ a similar mechanic, but only Union Pacific really captures the agony of the dreaded dividend card.  One turn you pray for it to lodge itself in the deck and the next for it to burst free, scoring you massive points.  The best stock game.

RATING: 8.5
Fun stock collection game.  I might be in the minority, but I enjoy the tension created by the semi-random card draw for scoring, and I find the game to be a good mix of luck and strategy.  Everyone apparently uses the house rule that you can only get one UP stock per round and only by DISCARDING another stock card.  I need to play more & try the unlimited U.P. stock variant.  

** update: my recent game with the basic rules reminded me how much more I like the game with a 'seeded' deck of stocks/dividend cards where the scoring rounds are slightly predictable and rarely back-to-back.  

** notes to self: with 6p, just get stock down early... scoring happens too fast to save small lines for majority.  Also, the track deck can be unforgiving; there is a lot of plain track (and very few wilds) in the track deck so you can get stuck/hosed if you focus exclusively on small lines that use specialied track. **  

Definitely want a 2nd copy.

While the track laying aspect is fairly run of the mill (and mildly annoying due to the fact that the tracks look pretty much the same to me) the selection and playing of shares really shines. Agonising decisions which turn to audible groans when a dividend card is turned up.

Revised Rating from an 8: Well, this is a train-themed game, which is fine, but it is not a train game, which is good. I'm not really a fan of train games, especially train games that also have a train theme. 

Anyway, I love the tension in this game. If you are playing with a good group (I always am!) this game can be fun, not dull. I'm starting to develop a nasty feeling about the Union Pacific cards and their ability to help determine the winner. I have to play more to figure it out, but I suspect there is a bit of a problem there.

Too bad it's OOP, I'm not shelling out $70 for it.

Rather light stock market game. Much more forgiving than Acquire (where I never seem to be able to get the cash management right) or even Big Boss, as players need no money to execute actions.

Pretty neat stock holding game, where you fight for stock control of various train companies, while also expanding the companies on the board.  There's a lot of leaching off from other players here, as often you're happy sitting in second place for a company, letting the first place player expand the railroad.

The game is also a lot about timing; when to expand a railroad and take a share of a company vs. when to play shares to the table, tipping your hand to your opponents.

There is one bit of wackiness concerning the availability of Union Pacific stock, which is a special type of stock in the game.  The game has to be played with unlimited UP stock to make it good in my opinion, but you'll have to play to see for yourself!

Nice tension in deciding whether to extend a line or declare stock. The rail cards are almost unnecessary (you can nearly always lay the track type you want) and could have been used to print out a few more UP shares instead (there should be a lot more than 20 so players can continue fighting for the majorities). Beautiful box, board and components. One of the best inserts for sorting the bits. Are you listening Mayfair?...Mayfair? Oh, never mind.

I would have to play this game a second time to give a more solid score.  We played with a house rule making the changing of one of the shares for a Union Pacific share as full turn (vs a free move that can be done as part of a regular turn).

Very exciting train game.  This is ticket to ride turbo with acquire mixed in - and its better than both them.  This is also better than Stephenson's Rocket.  The track cards could be graphically improved, but limit the area certain color trains can get to.  The Union Pacific stocks add a neat layer to the game to make the decisions extra juicy.  Very exciting to see what stock cards come up next and how other people can help you build your lines.

Set collecting with chain-based scalars, but without the multiplicative factors of Oasis, King's Breakfast, etc.  Very much an Alan Moon design with large luck factors.  Really needs to be played with the variant Vertung card placement, and UP only available via stock discard.

This grabbed my attention after hearing a podcast about train games.  Seems like just the thing I'd like -- between TTR (which I enjoy) and Age of Steam / 18xx (which are too heavy for me).  But, it's OOP.

However, Airlines: Europe has just come out, and has been described as being very similar to Union Pacific.  Which is why Airlines has jumped onto my wish list.  Looks like a nice step up from TTR, but still very accessible.

Ticket to Ride is a good game but falls short for me in two areas: it is a 5-player game (where most of my game groups have 6) and it is just a bit too light.  Union Pacific fills those shortcomings quite nicely.  There seems to be a bit more strategy with the options available and the tension is much higher as the unexpected dividend rounds come up.  This is fast becoming one of my favorite games.

The comparisons to Ticket to Ride are less superficial than I expected, but there is something much more engaging about Union Pacific. The tension of when the final dividend card appears is very savory. This game also scales remarkably well and is nicely accessible to casual gamers. This is one that I will bring to game nights often. For gamers that find Ticket to Ride to be close but leaving you flat....Union Pacific is a distant cousin that hits all the right spots. 

After more play, I'm starting to downgrade UP slightly with large numbers of players. I think its best with 4. With 6, I don't think you get enough actions per dividend card to make the game as interesting.

RATING: 5
Union Pacific is an old Moon game that is nominally about building railroads, but is actually about making money on stocks. The board futures a large number of train companies with their home bases spread across the continent. The map also features legal places to build track, and there are several different types of track. Some companies can only build on one or two types, others can build on any type. Each company is also limited by its physical train pieces, and can have more or less range based on that as well.

The turn structure is pretty simple: you can either lay a piece of track for any existing company (and get a stock from the display or off the top of the stock deck (and also turn one in your hand in for a UP stock) or you can lay out stocks from your hand. Companies increase in value just based on having more trains on the board, so play on the board is fairly rote, you want to increase the routes of the companies you have shares out or in your hand for any which-way (because all connections are of equal value, you just want to keep room to expand) because it will increase their payouts. Having a monopoly in the shares of any company is also very good, because when scoring happens (4 times per game) companies pay out 1st/2nd place based on their trains, but if someone is in a company by themself, they get both the 1st and 2nd place money. The only extra factor is the UP itself, which doesn't build track and isn't present on the board. It doesn't score in the first scoring round, but increases in value during each of the latter 3. It gives out rather fat money, and having a hand in it seems extremely useful. Scoring phases in general are triggered by cards that are in the stock deck. There are various ways to seed the deck so that they're less than completely random, but there's always some uncertainty involved.

This game is practically the definition of what I would consider recognizably good/workmanlike but unexciting. At heart it's a stock manipulation game that tightens the screws by making you want to increase your holdings in various companies while also increasing the value of those companies and never giving you enough of a chance to do both. I think the game suffers in that much of it does seem like superfluous chrome...the track cards seem wholly unnecessary, and the board is probably not needed either. The cards are so easy to deal with that they practically don't matter, and companies usually have room to roam. This probably could be abstracted out into a much simpler mechanism which would still play out in much the same way as the existing game but without the need for all of the components that the board makes the game require. The random scoring phases also provide some irk factor for people who want to play the game carefully. There are various ways to seed them into the deck, and how you do it is going to vastly impact the way the game plays. This reminds me of High Society in that it's a game where, because of the way the scoring works, you can only position yourself to win for a round or two. If that window passes, then you are probably going to be in trouble and there is no way to reliably know when that window is going to be there.

I can see why this game is well regarded but I think it would have to be developed down into a tighter package with less chaotic scoring for me to really like it. Too much is up to scoring round chance as it stands, and there are enough good, shorter stock games these days to create some competition for this slot. The Airlines Europe re-implementation at least smooths out the track portion of this game and rates a touch higher for me.

It has that railroad magic for me. This is a fine railroad games but many people, myself included, feel some adjustment is needed to the value of the Union Pacific shares.

Union Pacific had been sitting on the shelf for nearly two years ere I got a chance to really play it. The game is not bad, but it is certainly not good either, and most certainly vastly overrated here on the Geek. Much later I realised that Union Pacific is Alan Moon's take on Acquire, just as Stephenson's Rocket is Reiner Knizia's. However, as per usual with Moon designs, luck is far more prominent. There is a bit of thought involved when it is your turn, but if you put hoarding UP stock above all else (since the payoff is the biggest and not hampered by silly track restrictions), and then based on your gut feeling and a swift look around the table decide whether to invest or expand, you cannot go wrong, really. 

[b]Update[/b] The above is both right and wrong: UP stock is important, but it just means that people will hoard it in such a way that relative differences remain small. No, what really destroys the game is the completely unpredictable dividend payout which can cement good and bad positions in such a way that players lose the game there and then because of it. It's easy to fix... probably, because all suggested fixes I've looked at to date still use some form of randomness in when the cards come out. Thus odd clumping may still appear. Stephenson's Rocket is probably the better game here.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Juega con la regla a posteriori de ¿Alan? con ilimitadas acciones del UP. Por lo visto han aparecido pequeñas variaciones que tengo muchas dudas de que sean oficiales. Personalmente yo recomiendo jugar exactamente con las reglas originales con la colocación del mazo avanzada-equidistaste. Solo le añadiría las UP ilimitadas que hacen que sean totalmente equilibradas las UP del resto jueguen los jugadores que jueguen. La ventaja que tiene la forma de puntuar, es que le da mucha tensión al juego.

Este juego suele gustar a todo tipo de gente, incluido a los wargameros que pican eurogames.

El juego que funciona muy bien con cualquier número de personas incluso con 6, con dos puede ser una de las pocas pegas del juego.

Alan R.Moon lo reeditara en el 2007-2008 bajo el nombre de Baltimore & Ohio y con algunos cambios, pero lo cierto es que se me antoja casi imposible mejorarlo, a no ser que retoque estos detallitos comentados. El diseñador esta obsesionado con conseguir el juego perfecto de este estilo, pero el Union Pacific puede que sea el juego que mas se aproxima a su hipotético juego perfecto, apto para todo tipo de jugadores.[/COLOR]

There is little doubt that this one is a classic.  So much to like. Any future remake will go by a different name, so if you are pondering that decision, go find the original and you better do it soon!

Everyone ends up with the same amount of UP stock!

I don't enjoy this as much as I used to, alas. The share competition is interesting (the heart of the game, IMO); the route-building isn't very meaty (but takes up about half of playtime nonetheless). Union Pacific also seems too good, esp. in large games - next time I play, I want to try the unlimited-UP-shares variant.

[Edit: Having unlimited shares of Union Pacific notably improves the game, particularly with large numbers of players. I'd call it a 6.5 or 7 with that variant - I'm still not as fond of the route-building-ish piece, but the investment competition becomes much better balanced.]

RATING: 4
Production: Everything is quality, except perhaps the layout, where several colors are confusingly similar on the stock cards, and the rail types are difficult to differentiate.  Play: The interesting part of the game was the decision to build (increase value of existing stock, and draw one new stock) or play stock.  The tension between these two decisions is enough to entertain me, without the clumsy board, where there is seldom a conflict anyway.  (2+0+2) (1 play)

Like Acquire, but without the random tile draws, so there's less of a luck element.    Also, it helps a lot to know how the deck is set up so you know when to expect scoring rounds (probably less of an issue if everyone's played a few times).

Some say to skip the track cards or to play with unlimited UP stock.  However, I love it with track cards and a limit of 20 UP stock.  I use the rule that you have to discard a stock card in order to draw a UP stock (you may discard UP for UP).  I use the following variant rules for setting the deck: Deal cards to players, then deal 4 face down for the draw pile, then 6 on the bottom, 6 on the top, make three piles of 4 cards as buffers between sections of the deck.  Build the deck by dividing the remaining cards into 4 equal piles, shuffling the dividend cards in the piles, placing 6 cards on the bottom followed by the first pile, a stack of 4, the second pile, a second stack of 4, the third pile, a third stack of 4, the fourth pile, and then the top 6 cards.  The buffers mean you'll never have two dividend cards come up one right after the other.

Unlike some people I don't find downtime to be an issue at all. There are only a couple of real decisions each turn which keeps the game flowing. Furthermore, there isn't much scope for analysis paralysis as the luck element means that analysis will only get you so far. This is a great game to play with 6 players. Surprisingly thematic for something which is, essentially, abstract.

I enjoyed the basic mechanics, though no-one else seemed to.

Having all the open information in front of everyone made for a fair bit of computation necessary - specially towards the end.

However, it also gave meaning to each card to be turned over and injected some excitement into the proceedings as the card of a major company turned up.

The 'push your luck' aspect (You want to play shares before the payout but it's more efficient to wait longer and play many at a time) was interesting but in retrospect I think David's strategy of playing early and playing 2 at a time was the best. Many times a company went uncontested or even without any major shareholder at all! For that reason, the potential cards lost by playing two shares rather than more probably isn't as important as the potential income lost.

On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies. There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends. Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds. Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules. Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart. Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.

The track cards and board are virtually superfluous; it's rarely difficult to place an engine from the company that you're interested in expanding. Now, if the rules were taken literally to permit access to a company's station only through its first-placed engine, then you'd have some interesting decisions to make with the cards. Still, this game adds a layer of decisions to Get the Goods and thus improves on it. In GtG, the goods (railroad companies) are all the same value; in UP, you have to decide which companies' values to modify, and, of course, you have to figure out how to deal with the UP shares.

I have a feeling the author did not think the game system through carefully.  But if you ditch the board and track cards (track cards are especially very irritating, since they bring absolutely nothing to the game) and play only with the stock cards, this becomes a very good hand management game, full of suspense - however, that game already has a name: Get the Goods.  It feels a shame though, as I have a suspicion that this could have been a masterpiece if only the board play was half as interesting as the card play - but playing the complete game now just gives one an unsatisfactory feeling of playing what is in essence an unfinished game.

Essentially a new edition of Airlines.  Players represent share dealers trying to acquire share majorities in a dozen railways. On their turn, players can expand the railways on the map and draw stock into their hand, or simply declare stock to the table. Random scoring cards trigger the payout round when they appear, and majority stockholders earn cash based for the trains on the map. More trains equals more money! An excellent game.

RATING: 6
A blantant derivative of Acquire, yet a great game in its own right. Despite the utter lack of originality, this tinkering with Sackson's classic design produced a great game with a different set of challenges and mechanisms to contend with. Instead of the simple and blunt elegence of Acquire's open stock races, here is a set of new constraints as you have more hidden info, challenges to matching your companies to the track types, pushing-your-luck in waiting for more shares before the payouts occur, etc. Far and away Moon's best (re-)design.

I enjoyed the majority stock aspect of the game, although the railbuilding on the board seemed irrelevant.   Maybe it's underconstrained, because the type of rail cards never seemed to matter much.   There should be a player aid or guide printed on the board for the U.P. scoring, because for newcomers it is not clear at all.  (Interestingly, Airlines Europe did just that.)   The scoring system here is better than Airlines Europe, however.

Good game of majority stock acquisition, a bit like Acquire.  I like the trains on the board, although they don’t have quite enough integration in the game (they are only used for determining the point worth of a set of cards), and many of the same board patterns emerge every game (yellow has little competition and gets tons of trains; the mid-eastern areas never get filled before the game ends).  The game tends to be too long (for us, 3-4 hours with 6 players), and so I recommend biasing the deck to end the game sooner by putting scoring round cards before a minimum number of end cards in the deck.

Acquire + Ticket to Ride? Pretty much. Interesting mechanics and theme, but some odd design choices. I don't like that the money is only used for scoring and not to buy stock like in Acquire, for instance. 

In the end, I have decided that a lot of other games do what UP does and do it better to boot (Alhambra does the "surprise scoring rounds" better for instance), so I sold it.

I hear there's a new and improved version coming out, so I may take a look when the time comes.

Good game, but still prefer Ticket to Ride for its simple elegance. The Union Pacific board would do well to have a make over... the varied tracks are hard to read. Also, the need to match track cards to place trains on the boards seems like an extranious action.

RATING: 6
An interesting effort to repackage and re-theme Aquire into a train game, but I found the track card aspects fiddly.  The designer did a much better subsequent job with A Ticket to Ride (TTR) - a similar train theme repackaging of Rummy.

Overall, I found the game too luck-based and random and with so many push-your-luck options and train companies to choose from, new players are overwhelmed with analysis paralysis.  The dividend cards' appearances were very erratic and I would recommend the variant to seed the deck as in Pompeii or Cuba Libre.  Oh - and swap the paper money for poker chips instead.

One major dislike IMO is the sudden, immediate and unforeseeable game end (4th div card). Pompeii has this too, but it fits the theme, but here, with trains? No. In newer designs, the players can choose to trigger the game-end or it's more evident based on say the card deck being exhausted or the last train pieces of a certain colour being placed.

Union Pacific's components and map are prettier than Acquire, but if you have the latter - unless you love it, I wouldn't think there's much to be gained by going out to buy this one.  I prefer TTR (and use the Pennsylvania map expansion for the same buy-only, stock market experience), but I have never played Airlines Europe, nor Chicago Express, so I may revisit this rating later on.

Basically you're just choosing cards from a draw pile trying to maintain first and second place while playing trains on the board to increase the payouts.  There's some tension when scoring occurs, but overall the process of gaining majorities is a bit on the boring side.  Ticket to Ride does route building better and Acquire & Chicago Express do stocks better.  This feels like a compromise.

The Get the Goods/TtR drafting mechanic turned into an easy-to-approach stock game. One big difference between UP and TtR is there is no hoarding of stocks component. The game moves along without a need for that mechanic. The result is a game that constantly moves forward. UP is a game I've been waiting to play for a really long time, and it was worth the wait.

UP and its reimplementation, Airlines Europe, are both stock investment and manipulation games with a random payout mechanism used to create tension. That mechanism is either a feature or a flaw depending on your preference for depth, but it does create tension not knowing when the next scoring card is going to flip over. Since you don't know when to stop investing (playing track) and when to lay down stock (so they score), your strategic decisions are either to diversify for a lot of 2nd place payouts vs focusing on a few companies and/or go for the relatively rarer Union Pacific stock that increases dramatically in later scoring rounds. 

All in all, this game system offers some relatively interesting decisions, but can come down to the luck of the draw in whether or not one player wins over another. One round shorter or longer will probably change the winner, so it can feel a bit like musical chairs. It handles 6P well and in a reasonable amount of time. I actually prefer this original version to AE despite the hard-to-read track cards. AE is just too open; I like the way the track cards limit you here.

It is a good example of how good a game can be with a minimal amount rule learning, short turns and good bits.  Cards are beautiful as well.  I find games satisfying and easy to get into if you're going somewhere on a board or building connections.  Pick up and deliver games work for me as well.

O jogo mistura o fascínio por trens de Ticket to Ride com a mecânica de pontuação e compra de ações do Acquire. No jogo existem algumas companhias de trem e nós devemos constituir as ligações entre as cidades e adquirir suas ações. Quanto mais cidades a empresa conectar mais retorno ela dará aos jogadores (acionistas) que adquirirem suas ações. O tabuleiro tem uma série de trilho de diferentes bitolas. As empresas somente podem atuar alguns tipos. E esses trilhos têm limitações na quantidade de empresas que podem usá-los. Então ocorre uma briga, entre as empresas daquela área e que usam aquela bitola, para ver quem ocupa primeiro os espaços disponíveis. Além disso, ocorre uma disputa por ações para saber qual jogador detém o controle sobre cada empresa. Durante o jogo ocorrem quatro fases de pontuação. No momento de cada uma delas o jogador que detém mais ações recebe os lucros. Bom jogo e gostoso de jogar.

Union Pacific is like Ticket to Ride meets Acquire and I do love it very much still though and will probably change this posting after a good 4 player game.

Ah, what a wonderful game. I've always enjoyed the mechanics, and gameplay offers a lot of thought and some difficult decisions to make. There is the randomness of the cards, but that's not a deterrent in my opinion - it just ads a nice element of surprise ( and a bit of luck ). This was my game of the year in 1999 ( which seems like such a long time ago ), but doesn't seem to get much play anymore. I tend to break out Sante Fe Rails instead, which I feel is an easier and slightly quicker game.

Don't be fooled, though - this game is a classic.

Here is a "train" game for non-train game people to enjoy. There is great tension created by the random arrival of the dividend cards. Each turn you are limited to either investing in a train line or building up a train line but not both. This makes for some tough decisions.

I like the game a lot. My only complaint might be that after many playings I still have no clue during the game who is winning. A number of times I have tried to go after someone who at the end of the game was found to be no where near the top.

Nov 09 - Good quick "stock" game with a train theme. It really is a stock game and not a train game.  I feel that the game would almsot work equally well without a board, which just somewhat confuses things and creates a mild 'interaction' between the stock companies that has limited impact on the play.

Yet another Choo-Choo train game. It amazes me how many of these my best friend can find. This one could have been altered slightly and made it a stock manipulation game (which is really what it is) that doesn't require so much real estate to play it on. Still a good game that I would like to play again, reasonably often. In the future I see this sold as a combo with Ticket to Ride since the maps and pieces are almost identical.

I enjoy Union Pacific despite a few problems that bug me: (1) the positional board play only very rarely has any effect on the game; (2) the board's aesthetics are horrible; (3) the track cards are fiddly and can bog down the pace of the game; and (4) the draft display can become clogged for long portions of the game, which frustrates me to no end when it happens.  If you like, you can just ditch the board (or play without the track cards) without losing much in terms of gameplay.  Having said all that, I'll also say that Union Pacific is just plain *fun*.  Let's call it a flawed masterpiece.  Without the board and track cards, the game rates a point higher for me.  If you do want to keep the board and the track cards, you might be better off seeking out Airlines.  Those elements mattered more in Airlines, in fact I consider them relics from the earlier design that are no longer fitting.

I think that this game has the greatest amount of player AGONY when the random scoring rounds happen, moreso than even Tikal.  It's a fun ride (har-har), but the game could have used a better graphical design—the board is unnecessarily cluttered, the colors don't match between the cards and trains, and the track cards add completely needless randomness and complexity.  Someday I'm going to have a penny with me and lay it down in front of the train a player is building, and SOMEDAY someone will think that's funny.

RATING: 8
Of the three main Alan Moon games (Ticket to Ride, Union Pacific, and Santa Fe Rails), I like UP best.  It's not as friendly to newbies or casual gamers as Ticket to Ride is, probably because of the additional complication of owning shares in the railroad companies.  But I think it adds some interesting strategic and tactical elements (and a lot of tension!) to the game.

I usually play with a variant (I think?) where you have to discard an unplayed share from your hand in order to get an unplayed share of the UP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like with all Alan R. Moon games, theme here is thin, making it a bit too abstract. The gameplay itself is okay, not bad, but not outstanding either. The relation to Ticket to ride is clearly visible, but I would prefer Union Pacific any time, as it appears to be less random.

What a great game. I can see where people compare it to Acquire, and I love Acquire, but there really is no comparison. It's another game where you have many more desirable play options than you have turns and that makes this all the more exciting.

Update: I just played the 2-player variant that Winton Lemoine and Dave Arnott put together and it really introduces a new level of strategy to the game. It's really worth trying. It's in the bgg files under "Game Central Station Track 20 2-Player Union Pacific Variant.doc"

One of my original obsessions, I can't play this as often as I'd like: bad for the blood pressure.

[Initial Impression: 9]
This train-themed game is often compared to Acquire in feel, and for good reason.  Both games have a similar majority/minority shareholder scoring system and companies develop by expanding the tiles that they control.  However, I find Union Pacific even more compelling than that beloved classic for two main reasons: 1) On each turn, you must deal with the tension of deciding whether to "invest" the shares you already hold or to acquire new shares.  Wait too long to invest and the scoring rounds will surprise you before you're ready!  2) Laying the pieces on the board is much more interesting, as the placements can be highly meaningful - claiming the right tracks can open up new territories for companies you control or block off the expansion of companies controlled by others.  The game is characterized by a constant struggle to maintain or wrest control of existing companies and to build up smaller companies in which you can claim a large stake.

Union Pacific somehow feels both similar and dissimilar to it's reimplementation, Airlines Europe.

The stocks increase in value, yes, but the choices between investing or increasing value in stock feel tighter, the actions more limited, the dividend schedule more random (at least with the base rules).

Also the choice between taking one more stock or investing is always a realistic one, unlike Airlines Europe where the only way to get money to increase stock value is to invest.

The production is hardly less impressive than Airlines Europe, as much as I like that game, and the track cards make the train theme more present, as opposed to the less-well concealed stock game that Airlines Europe is.

This is yet another fine game from Alan R. Moon, and I truly can't rate it any lower than his reimplementation- this starts at a 7.5, and it is clear to me now why many love this version best.

Raised to a 7.75 after 5 plays- this is truly a more elegant game than its reimplementation.

My wife absolutely loves this game, and I agree with her, It's one of my favorites.  This was the first game we ever played that had the element of a random ending to it, so the added aprehension really made playing it a blast.  A lot of people critisize the board as not having any use because even if you try to you can't stop any other players from doing anything.  They haven't played enough.  There is a strategic side to laying your trains, and on more than one ocasion I've found myself fuming when I can't lay any more trains that I'm the chief share holder in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good game, that is closer to a simplification of Aquire than Ages of Steam.  By that, I mean that the game is more about finances with a little railroad strategy thrown in.  

There is a good deal of luck involved in this game, and it is accessibly to most family members (say over 10 yrs old), but the complexities of major/minor stock holder and Union Pacific stock can confuse many.  

I like this as a slightly more strategic game that Ticket to Ride, which is a little easier for younger family members.  

The only down-side I have found with Union Pacific is when new gamers reach analysis-paralisis.  We had a game top 3 hours because two players were trying to optimize every move...

I didn't really appreciate this design when I first played it nearly ten years ago. After playing a bunch of train games, and revisiting this, this is a great, classic game. Too bad it is OOP. I am curious to see if Airlines Europe will scratch the same itch. It's a '7'.

Update (01/14/12): Time makes the heart grow fonder. I'd like to get a copy of this, since hearing that Airlines Europe may be a tad different. Still, it is an Alan Moon design, and I am beginning to really appreciate his designs even more.

A simple shareholding game in which you boost the value of one of the companies on the board then pick up one of the offered shares. Some tension in the pseudo-random timing of the scoring rounds, but there's also a substantial chaos factor at work, so there's no point in feeling aggrieved about losing. Similar to, but better than Acquire as you're less constrained by the system from making a good play. There's generally a flaw in an Alan Moon game, and here it's the silly rules for the lucrative Union Pacific stock that guarantee the start player the possibility of at least an equal majority.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I liked this much better than I expected!  A stock game where the investment is in time (that is, turns) rather than money.  It's pretty exciting and things can change quickly. It is probably easier than it ought to be to get into a position where you can only help other players instead of yourself. (2 plays)

Gran juego para 6 jugadores que funciona muy bien. Debería jugarse con las cartas de dividendo homogeneamente distribuídas y con infinitas acciones de Union Pacific, para evitar que los primeros jugadores tengan mucha ventaja. Buenísima mecánica  la de la dura elección de cada turno consistente en  colocar trenes para aumentar ganancias o invertir en acciones para ganar dinero. Excelente idea la de no saber cuándo finalizará el juego. Contras: prefiero una columna de puntuación o jugar con fichas de poker antes que los billetes que retrasan mucho el juego. Turnos muy repetitivos. Los colores pueden confundirse.La suerte afecta a la puntuación.

First played March 5th, 2008. Taught in ~10min, played in 1.5hrs with 3/4 players. This has a good mix of luck and strategy. The goal is simple, collect the most money. There are two decks. A rail deck which consist of 4 different kinds of track and a wild card (any of the 4 types). A rail owner deck which has one of 10 different rails you can own a share. There are also is a limited stack of Union Pacific cards. You start with 3 rail cards, 5 share cards and a Union Pacific card. On your turn you always draw a rail card. Then you decide to play the rail card and build a rail (play a matching rail card for the line you want to extend and draw a share card; one of the 4 face up cards or the top face down card; if you decided you don't want that card you can swap it for a Union Pacific card if there are any left), declare a share (discard a rail card and play one of the same group cards or two of any different cards). There are four scoring rounds which award $1 for each train to the player with the most share cards and half that for 2nd place. Union Pacific owners get a certain amount of $ as well. I'd recommened this as a great borrow, however I wouldn't push as hard for ownership.

Ticket to Ride mutated with Chicago Express.  Everyone builds rail lines, tries to collect shares in companies to dominate control.  Very nice thinky game.  Randomness of endgame can have the game go a bit long at times (likewise, sometimes very fast sudden end).  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very Fun Game!  You have tough choices to make each turn: Do I expand a rail line or do I play stock? I think it is a stock game with a Train theme. I like it better then Acquire which was my favorite "stock" type game.  You can find yourself out of money to buy stock in "Acquire" if mergers go bad.  In "Union Pacific" you can always get more stock by increasing the size of a rail line.

Only 1 play, but seems worth the effort to acquire at this point.  It played pretty smoothly with 6 players even.

I'm still not sure how nerfed the Union Pacific stock needs to be.  It's definitely broken in the original rules.  And since it doesn't even have a board presence, I felt dirty winning due to it's payouts.

The actual board play and random dividend payouts are lots of fun though.  It always feels like you would have been ready "if I'd had one more turn!"

A first game with 2 players was incredibly dull, but a subsequent 4-player game was interesting throughout despite being a little lengthy. Union Pacific has some nice features such as the different characteristics of the railway companies, and the dividend payments which make timing important and bring some tension to the game. I wonder whether the board and track cards really add much to the game as they only seem to play a significant role towards the end.

Great game.  Best if you use the Funagain deck contruct variant to prevent multiple score cards from appearing too close together.

This is my favorite Alan Moon game. It draws some comparisons to Acquire and I once owned Airlines but I just enjoy playing this more (much more than Airlines). Maybe the train theme is just more appealing to me. Probably so. 

The randomness moves from the tile draw of Acquire to a card draw in UP. Mergers and bonuses are eliminated but you'll never go a turn with nothing to do because you have no cash as in often the case in Acquire. 

The game moves quickly and players turns are short, so there is little downtime. There's plenty of indirect conflict and even a little bluffing and screwage in the game. 

I have the German version of the game but it is completely text free anyway so it doesn't matter because besides the rulebook,it is completely language independant. Get this game while you still can if you can find it.

RATING: 9
This is a really nice building & stock trading game. 
The train theme is incidental as it just forms the building mechanism. The real action is in the stock  acquisition and stock deployment mechanism. The game requires the user to not just obtain stock, but to spend a turn deploying it out of your hand in very limited quantities and the timing of this is critical. Optimally you will deploy your stock just before the stock is scored, however the stock scoring is a card flip so it can come earlier than anticipated.
Enjoy!

RATING: 8.5
Like to play version where you can only get 1 UP stock per turn through burning/trading another stock.  I have found that UP stock is not all powerful.  Unless someone gets and keeps the UP majority with little effort in which case the other players only have themselves to blame.  Usually you find at least 2 players trying to get lots of UP stock - in which case you can focus more on getting lots of majorities/2nd places in the other railroads to more than compansate.
Slight negative on the relevance of the board which could I think be made a little tighter to increase train placement strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent "light" train game.  The key decision is whether to improve lines that you have already invested in, or to improve your investments - since you can't do both, the decision becomes increasingly difficult.  Good bits, too. I really like this one.

This game has been described as Aquire on steroids.  Although I can see the similarities, the games are vastly different.  Outside the very strategic 18xx series, you couldn't find a better train game... a definite 10.  Alan Moon at his very best.

RATING: 7
This game has the problem that you have to keep track of all the cards that are in front of people. E.g. if you have the most red cards (they are categorized by a name, but hey...) in front of you, you gain. That makes it not easy to keep track of everything that's happening. If everyone manages, it's quite a good business game that works okay.

Union Pacific is wonderful conceptually, but lacks elegance and flow, mainly in the "track" system (both on the board and the track cards). This critique aside, the meaningful interaction among players, strategic decision making, and advanced planning make for a very satisfying gaming experience. The anticipation of not knowing when the scoring rounds will occur creates an exciting tension as you decide whether to invest or build.

Funny little investing game. However the rail symbols on the cards can be confusing to distinguish. It also seems that the amount of cards of the base deck is too high, so the game lasts quite a few rounds too long. And,,, avoid being the banker of the game!

A set-building card game/board game in a similar vein as Ticket to Ride. This game is more strategically complex than TtR, but still not heavy. There a lot of things to consider when investing or building track. The luck of the draw is pretty pronounced. The game can feel a bit chaotic, but not quite enough to make you feel completely lost. Great choice as a next-step game after the gateway games have got'em hooked. A good-looking game. Beautiful box design. I do have concerns that the UP cards are a bit overpowered. We'll see.

Played about 10-15 times, I would imagine.  Not a game I would push others to play, but would gladly play over alternatives.  There appears to a seating position with more than four players, since players 5 and 6 can't get an equal share of UP shares if everyone elects to trade for one in the initial rounds.  Not sure getting a leg up with one of the lesser RRs compensates for this.  Still, a very good game when it came out that I believe has been overshadowed by more recent designs.

I played this game for one game and liked it quite a lot. I think I'll have to play a game or two more sometime to decide if I'll buy this or not but still, I liked it a lot... Because there is a little randomness going on with the scorings you'll have to gamble a little bit on playin the shares to the table. Also the choice between building a track +taking shares vs. playing shares on table is sometimes quite hard.

Update: I'll probably never buy this. I won't get to play it too often anyway.

The stock acquisitions and the growing train lines is similar to Acquire, except that there are no mergers. Dividends occur randomly so you have to take your chances on whether or not to play stock certificates. Should be played with the variant that allows an unlimited amount of UP shares to be issued, as this variant makes NOT going after UP shares a viable strategy. If some of your opponents get into a UP war, you may very well overtake them by dominating the other train companies. This is a great game that rewards opportunistic play and risk-taking. But the downside of risk-taking in Union Pacific is like getting kicked in the balls. It hurts when your gamble goes wrong, and that makes for an awesome game.

Woo Hoo - A copy in shrink from Germany!  I have often heard this compared to Ticket to Ride.  Whilst they do share some similar mechanisms (draw, set collect and play trains) they are quite different in my book.  Ticket to Ride is definitely a lighter game.  Union Pacific generates much more angst in terms of "what I am going do this turn?  Pick up that share I want, play the shares I need to control the company etc."

Based on 5+ plays.  A fun game with the classic Alan Moon agonized decision-making.  At first I dismissed the train placement as meaningless, but now I'm beginning to appreciate its nuance.

My regard for this game has slipped a couple notches over time.  I still consider it a good game.  

I tried playing this with a group of non-gamers a while back - it was a disaster.  We took two hours, and finally called the game due to time.  We had only reached the first payoff!  Each turn. the newbies were carefully studying the board and their hand.  I've rarely ever seen any company closed out from routes on the gameboard.   But of course they didn't know this.  

After that experience, I came to realize that U.P. is more for the gamer than casual family gaming.  But U.P. also annoys the hardcore strategist with the wertung feature.

Great fun for 4 - 6 players.
When we dont want to break out Age of Steam this is a great replacement. Much less of a brain burner and lots of anticipation. We always play the rule of shuffling the dividend cards as per the rules. I think not knowing when the game ends adds so MUCH more to the game. It means there a variety of strategies and risks involved. If you knew the last dividend card was guaranteed not to come up until the very end, I think the strategies would be different and more cards would be hoarded.

Several games.  I really like this game, despite its Acquire-ness.  I should like this less, what with the randomness of the stocks AND track pieces.  But, it's a fast enough play, that if a player is getting hosed all the time (it's happened), something else is around the corner.  However, 6 player games can take a very long time, as there's little to do between turns.

RATING: 8
One of the few games that works great for six players; I usually prefer this over the super classic Acquire.  

I'm convinced of playing this with the deck building rules of the 2nd edition.  Or, better yet the advanced 2nd ed. variant.  The 2nd edition deck build is deal out cards, flip four display cards and break deck into four piles (six cards on top, six cards on bottom, eighteen cards in middle and the rest of bulky pile in middle) where one dividend card is shuffled into the 2nd part and the other three dividends into the bulky third part of deck.  

The "advanced 2nd ed. variant" is more evenly balanced than that.  It's as follows, deal out player's cards, flip four for display and count out n number of cards per player x2 face down (this is the top of the deck and bottom of the deck - i.e. if 6 plyrs, 6 face down on top and 6 face down on bottom of deck).  Then, break deck up into four equal parts and shuffle a dividend card into each section and put them together with the n cards on top of this.  This is usually the longer version of the game with less randomness attributed to when the dividend score cards arise.

RATING: 8
LIKES:

* Straightforward stock market game masquerading as a train game.
* Interesting track play of different train companies can lead to limiting expansion and value capabilities of different train companies.
* Choice between claiming stock by laying down stock versus selecting stock to play later provides a fair bit of tension, particularly when you sense a scoring card is overdue!  Within the stock choice option also is the tension between throwing away a stock to claim a UP stock.  Also, tension exists between fighting for majority shares and being content with second.
* I enjoy the riding on someone else's work aspect of the game.  There are times you can play one stock down and gain $5-8 for second place and do very little of the work!

DISLIKES:

* Track cards can be limiting.  Some feel track cards are pointless and should be done away with but I'm not sure I'm in the group.  One can be frustrated if one doesn't receive the right track card.  
* Some people dislike players hoarding the Wild Track cards.  That means I'm usually not well liked.  :-)

RATING: 6
Union Pacific is a decent enough game. I just happen to not like train games. I can definitely see where Moon based his ever popular Ticket to Ride on. It seems to me that not having unlimited UP shares unbalances the game in favor of the first few players until the stocks run out. The game has interesting choices but can get bogged down if you don't get the shares you want, or the tracks you need to help expand the lines you have invested in. If I had to play a train game, this would probably be it, but overall I just don't enjoy the train theme, and tend to avoid them at all costs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting train/stock game.  The action on the board takes a back seat to the acquistion of stock certificates and the timing of their release.  Vying for majorities gives the game a good dose of tension and the limitations of track the can be built can force one to rethink long term plans.

Acquire variant with silly Ticket-to-Ride style card drafting.  Too many cards to deal with at once.

Alan Moon's game that predates Ticket to Ride.  You can acquire stock or turn stock in for UP stock.  At various intervals there is scoring the UP stock.  You can also expand companies playing cards with various types of track.  This is the clunkiest part of the game.  It is hard to read these cards and determine where on the board is the track.  You get it after a while, but it takes a bit of time.  

I found the game acceptable and I would play it again, but Airlines Europe is a much better implementation.

A tense game of excruciating decision angst. The simple decision of growing a line and taking stock, or putting stock into play is made very difficult because it often seems crucial to take not just the one you are allowed but 2 or 3 available stocks and to play stock you already have. Fantastic experience. There do seem to be some odd rules quirks to it though.

I haven't played a train game in a long time and really enjoyed this one.  Should you invest?  Or should you create a route?  The choice is sometimes difficult.  I had a lot of fun playing this one.  The black and purple color trains mix together a little, but if you are careful you can differentiate them with not much trouble.  Great board and asthetics.  They should reproduce the English version of this game.  I'd buy it!

Played only as a two-player game so far.  UP Stock doesn't seem to be as important as some people have indicated in games with more players.  Essential to have stock in every railroad so that other player doesn't run away with game. German edition. Came missing 3 trains!:(

This game seems to drag and sometimes the randomness gets me down (like the game where the second, third, and fourth dividend cards came out one right after the other). 

This game starts to feel mechanical after a while.  

It just isn't compelling, but I like it better than most of Moon's games.

Based on 5+ plays.

While i like this game, the more I play the more issues with it I find.  The game really is too random with more than 4 players.  The number of turns players get before a scoring round is not enough (especially the 1st round where some players may get only one turn) Also without the unlimited UP card options the game lacks tension once the UP cards are gone. In 4 and 5 player games the up cards can end up splitting evenly, what fun is that. (I lowered my rating from 8 to 5)Also Playing with the unlimited UP cards helps, but the randomness of the payouts can make the endgame very dependent on luck. If the pay out comes exceptionally early you may have as little as 1 turn between the 3 and 4th payouts. This just sucks, and ruins the entire game.

Un juego de rápido desarrollo y donde el factor suerte incide, pero no desagradablemente. 
Cada jugador junta cartas de determinado tipo y cuando se evalúa (4 veces en el juego y de manera no programada totalmente), quien posea más de un color gana un determinado premio.
Y el premio está determinado por la cantidad de líneas férreas de cada color de carta (empresa ferroviaria) posea en el mapa. Por eso es que el jugador debe juntar acciones de una empresa, pero al mismo teimpo hacer crecer las líneas de esa empresa para ganar más dinero.

Well I am still scratching my head with this one....However...combine Ticket to Ride with Alhambra and that's exacly what this is. 

Good, but its age shows some problems: 
1) Your actions are quite limited especially approaching the end of the game
2) It is very difficult to beat frontrunners in this game (see 1) )

I am generous with my '8'. Probably deserves only 7...

New in collection jan. 07
After first 2 plays: Exciting, because of the constant tension: should I play track and expand my hand, or play stock NOW because dividend may be next? The game can have a feeling of unfairness with the official rules, (2nd game had 2 dividend payouts in the same turn which caused a runaway leader, never to be caught again) but is nevertheless fun enough to pull out for casual gamers. 

NL: Trein en dividendspel. Spannend door de continue onzekerheid op welk moment er uitbetaald gaat worden. Moet je eigenlijk met minimaal 4 mensen spelen. Spannend met 5. Als iedereen een beetje doorspeelt.

Great stock game.  Probably Alan Moon's best production.  It looks & even plays similarly to his later success, Ticket to Ride, but it's much deeper and ultimately a very different game.

RATING: 8
Okay, I get the feeling that this may not have gone over too well with my normal game group (they seemed kind of bored), but I think it is pretty great!  Simple game with enough stuff to manage to produce some kind of tense decision making.  This tense decision making is amplified by a "press your luck" mechanic for determining when payment (really scoring) happens.

The basics of the game:

On your turn either expand a railroad...or...invest in the railroads themselves.  Whoever has invested more in the each railroad receives a bigger payoff.  The more expansive a railroad is the more that payoff will be.  Since you only get to do one of these, and the moment of payoff is somewhat random, deciding whether to expand or invest gets pretty tough!

The two options can only be performed separately from each other, but are ultimately linked quite nicely.

What Ticket to Ride wishes it could be???  Anyone???

Entertaining game, with an interesting hook: should I buy or play shares? This makes for some great tension in the game. The game is also easy enough to be quite widely accessible.

However, it's also a bit too long, especially if the dividends are in the end of the deck (might actually want to ensure they're not on the very bottom), and the graphic design is really subpar and makes the game more difficult to play than is necessary.

Suggest.

Alan Moon's best game (the best of the several I've played anyway). Wish there were definitive rules regarding the preparation of the deck and the acquisition of UP stock. The train-placing part of the game seems to be too easy and not tight enough. [19 plays but seldom lately]

Certainly better than Ticket To Ride, but still not really my thing. I just cannot get excited about set collection and route-building, and I keep thinking to myself, why is the train theme so damn popular?

Not our favorite train game: it's quite disturbing with the different rail types, number of cards and number of trains of a particular railway company. Ticket to Ride from the same author is much more straightforward in our opinion. I need to play Airlines Europe first and if I like that one more, this one probably gets sold.

Feels very repitive after the initial rounds. Build one track, build a second track, play both stocks, build one track,.... All this because you never know when the next pay-out will be and you don't want to miss on the money with the good stock sitting in your hand.

This game might have been good some years ago but there are tons of better train games out there at the moment.

RATING: 9
True, the track-laying, railroad theme is kind of tacked-on rather than woven-in, but the same can be said about Acquire's hotel chain theme.  Nice to find a good six player German-like game.  Most German games max out at five players.  I never played Airlines so I can't negatively compare UP to that.   The rules are easy to learn, turns are relatively quick, always more good choices than you're allowed to execute, and suspense lasts until the final dividend card is drawn.  Some people claim the UP stock is too powerful and whoever has the most UP stock always wins.  Not true.  We have had games where the winner owned NO Union Pacific stock!  We found many potential winning strategies, including owning as many uncontested smaller railroad stocks (no secondary shareholder) as possible.  Getting the most bang out of each share is the key.  If you get in an arms race for the most shares of corporation, you and your rival will be opening the door for someone else to win.

Play track, acquire stock in a particular raidroad, but only played stock gives you points when counting majorities. We've played this game numerous times with rule variants. First few times, we realized the UP shares were more important than anything else, so whoever went first had the advantage of getting 2 shares more relative to the last player (and in a 6 player game, the last couple of people will be short). So we did away with UP shares. Also when 2 players compete in the green railroad, everyone else could potentially get left in the dust. Of course the timing of the dividend cards and the draw of the shares adds uncertainty to the game. This game has some nice ideas, though and not a bad try for a train game.

After half-a-dozen plays, this has climbed into the elite bunch of games I score a 9 or better. Simple enough to give your brain a breather but plenty of angst in the do-I-or-don't-I decision between expansion and investment, waiting for that scoring card to rear its ugly/beautiful head depending on your position. As long as we don't play this one too often and wear out its charm, I can see it making a fairly regular appearance on the table for years to come.

Having shares in multiple companies ensures that you'll get a broad payoff. Sometimes it's good to be the second place in someone else's big train line, especially if it's cheap enough. It's not always best to spend too much time concentrating on only one line.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.35
The game is very similar too Airlines Europe (reimplementatation of Union Pacifc). In fact, the core mechanics are the same, you can either get shares to your hand or put them on the table so that they cound when the scoring comes. This creates a lot of tension, because there's always an action you want/need to get a majority or protect your lead, and it's hard to say no to that...

But there are also a few minor changes (from what I remember from 8 months ago, I could be wrong in some):
-> The scoring phases in Union Pacific are more random. This adds to the sensation of uncertainty and tension.
-> The board seems more unforgiving. It's easier to block companies.
-> You need cards to expand companies. Some are easier to expand than others, because they allor for a wider variety of cards. I'm not sure what to think about it. It adds some depth to the game, but also increases the playing time.

It all serves to increase the tension from Airlines Europe and makes the game more random too.

Again, as in Airlines Europe, the tension is the main virtue of the game. And contrary to AE, this game was very fluid, the turns passed very fast and the game didn't last long. I think probably it's because of the players, because the rules differences don't suggest it should play faster (quite contrary, because of the rail cards).

Nonethless, we commited the "mistake" of keeping our money public, and we saw that the ranking never changed. The winner was already winning in the first scoring, I was third during all the game, etc... I really hope this was just an odd game.

Very good train game.  But it is really a stock game.  More similar to Acquire than to Ticket to Ride.  

It doesn't play well as a 2 player game.

Maximum replayability.  Can only take stock of the 4 face up cards and can only lay track with one of the 4 cards in hand.  Need 2 turns to take stock in hand and then lay on table.  Only stock on table counts.

Simple rules combined with some depth. The game becomes less plannable with more players. With five or six players, it's almost entirely luck. You are lucky if you are the first player (for getting the most UP cards); later on: Develop your campany and hope for the right shares to show up/draw. On the other hand, the game gets more tense with more players.

(21/05/06).  Nog zo'n spel dat ik reeds jaren in de kast heb liggen, maar nog nooit gespeeld heb.  Toch de moeite om het eens te proberen.  De spelregels zijn eenvoudig.  Het is een bluf spel met genoeg interactie tussen de spelers.  De bedoeling is om zo veel mogelijk aandelen te verzamelen van de verschillende treinmaatschappijen.  Net zoals bij El Grande zijn er tusssentijdse tellingen.  Wie 1e staat krijgt punten, 2e de helft van de punten, 3e niets.  Speelden mee: Franky, Frederik en ikzelf.

RATING: 4
A lot like Alhambra meets Ticket to Ride, though it feels like a heavier game than those two. Middleweight.

Each turn you have to choose either to draw stock cards  or play them (which later scores for you). The later you leave playing cards, the better* (like Ticket to Ride), but you might miss a scoring round, which come out at random and reward 1st and 2nd place (like Alhambra).

*more stock can be put out at once. 

The Union Pacific company is non-obvious, as is the choice of which company to build for.

This is a game that's able to be played repeatedly as a light strategy game with friends and non-gamers.

This is one of the few stock games that I like, mainly because it's really easy to obtain stock; there's no auctions that force you to evaluate things on the spot, you just pick stock up at the end of the turn.  The Alhambra-style scoring puts in a layer of uncertainty and push-your-luck, which I'm not sure is my favorite thing (especially with a larger number of players).  But, it's a lot of fun.

Game has a lot of tension with simple rules/strategy, however with depth.  I like directly competing against other players.  For a game with economic mechanics, it does them quite well at a high level.

One main issue is that the scoring rounds are random in the deck, not even confined to certain portions of the deck.  I've had games ending quickly due to abnormal placement of the scoring markers.

I have fond memories of this game from years past and am a general fan of both stock and train themed games. But Union Pacific just hasn't stood the test of time. The UP stock cards are too important, the track cards are not important enough, and the player order can actually have a real impact on the final outcome which seldom is a good sign. Its proverbial heir, Airlines Europe, fixes some of those issues but I would argue that even the successor fails at getting the inherited assortment of mechanisms to run smoothly and without disturbing glitches.

Every time I go to play this game I end up thinking &quot;OK, whatever, another game of Union Pacific.&quot;  Then we start.  This game has the ability to capture me over and over again with its simplicity of rules, grueling decisions, and the way the board changes enough for me to wish I could backpedal every once in a while.  Great bits, attractive game.  A real workhorse that should be in everyone&#039;s collection.

Don't let my inner Knizia freak hear this, but I like this game a lot better than I thought I would. It shows that a game doesn't have to be really deep, full of agonizing if-I-do-this-then-he-will-do-that decisions and constantly changing game situations to be fun. It's simple, it's tense, it's fun!

RATING: 5
I have since realised I'm not a fan of the standard majorities scoring mechanic. Sure the race to become 1st or 2nd in holdings is exciting, especially when payout is randomised in the draw pile (so UP is better than Acquire) but the comparing and payout procedure really distills that feeling, especially involving money transactions. If I remember rightly, it is worse here in that you have to work out the value of the payout first. Aaaaaah! 

Thankfully another design such as O Zoo le Mio (and Alhambra to a slightly tolerable degree) shows how to do majority scoring smoothly and effectively.

RATING: 6
A game that I felt showed its age. I like the tension of deciding whether to play out your shares or hold on until you've accumulated more, but the game seemed overly determined by the timing of the dividend rounds, which is impossible to predict. And I found the track-building system fiddly and a bit irritating. It mostly doesn't constrain you at all, but when it does, it can be a royal pain. UP seemed to sit awkwardly between the elegant, classic Acquire and the intricate, brilliant Stephenson's Rocket and I wouldn't choose to play it again over either.

Excellent game, easy to learn and fun to play.  Always nice to clue new gamers in on buying the UP stock before it's depleted. Definitely need to play it more.

RATING: 10
A favorite stock market game, - 
As you build a line you are collecting stock which improves your position. However, there is a lot of tension when to pull the trigger on your stock versus  when the dividend card comes out. Also have to decide which lines to build, which opponents to work against ....
Generally not played using the "stacked" deck approach but if you want to play with a bit more control of the dividends it would help.
Also always play with the approved variant of having to trade a stock card to get a UP card
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After 1 play my impression is that it seems very much like the card game Reibach & Co (Get the Goods) in terms of collecting and scoring, with the added train placement theme to determine the value of the scoring. Both are by Moon.

 My favorite board game of all time!!!  Though it deals with trains, this is not a "train" gain like Empire Builder and the rest.  Very simple rules, with the stress of never knowing when that score card will show up.  This game has often been compared to Aquire.  I see a slight similarity, but I don't like Aquire and I love Union Pacific. (Suggest not using the tracks in a 6-player game.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one is ok. It has a few mechanics that sort of knock it down a level for me. 1 is the end game is extremely random. You have 4 cards shuffled into a big deck, once all 4 are picked, the game ends. You have no idea when this happens at all. Also the union pacific railroad share are worth way more than anything else in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Union Pacific is a nice card game where they added a board. You have to build in order to get possible assets and these assets will generate the income. Nice fast paced game. In the components you can see that this is a older game, the game play still is fine. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
While I usually let games stand on their own without comparision, UP is just so much like Acquire, I wonder why it was ever made.  The main differenct between the two is that there is no real economic system in UP.  In Acquire you use the money (victory points) you make off of mergers (comprable to scoring rounds in UP) to reinvest in other companies.  In UP this is replaced with the push-your-luck decision of whether to invest or expand.

I'm not a fan of the UP stock options either.  It seems you want to grab them up as soon as you can because their value is so great at the end of the game.

In conclusion, I'd play this game because it's simple and fast, but I think Acquire is better in every way.

RATING: 7
With five or six players? An overly-long and tedious card game disguised as a board game. Not enough to do on your turn, no tough decision making and the board is ridiculous. Slower than a train journey through Eastern Europe (very slow). Enjoyed it with 3 players, because even though very little decision making, it was fast. I'd give it a 7 with 3 players; 4 with any more.

Some may say that Union Pacific is rather a stock game than a train game. I only know that is not an economic game for sure. The only currency is the number of actions per turn: You increase one companies network (without paying) and take a certain number of stocks (without paying for these as well). The stocks available to pick from is restricted. 

That there is no economy in a train game (yes, this also applies to Ticket to Ride) and that you do not invest in stocks but just take what is available, makes this game really uninteresting for me. In fact, I think it is completely pointless. I had some fun playing Union Pacific, but I do not know if I will ever bring it to the table in the future. In the end, there are just a bunch of abstract mechanisms.

Excellent game! I really enjoy when designers install a sytem into the game that requires sacrifice. On your turn you have a CHOICE of playing stock or getting stock (which increases the value of one line). There is a further agonizing decision to trade away stock for U.P. stock. Game play is fast, and down time is minimal. I think it plays best with 4 players. I like the unpredictable way that the pay-outs happen. Great components too!

What can I say?  Consistently fun after dozens of plays and lightning fast in our group.  One of the select group of desert island games, especially for the larger group.

UPDATE 11/20/12: One thing that wasn't obvious to me when loving and rating this game, but which became obvious when I taught the game to a mixed group of newbies and people who know the game from outside my gaming group: Our group plays with a few rules tweaks that probably give the game at least an extra point or two of rating.  First, the scoring cards are more sanely distributed in the deck: after dealing hands and making the initial display, deal four stacks of six cards and divide the rest of the deck roughly into quarters; shuffle a scoring card into each quarter and put a stack of six cards on each, then stack those to make the deck.  Back-to-back, game-breaking scoring cards won't happen.  Second, the payouts for Union Pacific are changed from 0-10-15-20 for first place to 0-5-10-15.  This keeps UP from being a required part of a winning strategy.  Finally, a player can only trade for a share of UP stock after placing a train and drawing a stock, so the game isn't delayed by taking UP, and you must give up some share in hand for it.

A great game that I only recently discovered.  It has a lot of tension (IMO) as the rounds come to an end, tough decisions (buy UP stock ? or fight for majority in another? or just build?), and hits the bullseye on my luck/strategy target!  Now, I just need to find a copy in English...

Other than the fact that it plays with six, I don't really get it. The scoring points are a lottery. The card draw is a lottery. Other players screw with your best laid plans. That's all well and good, but it all a bit ho-hum processional. I like that other players in my gaming circle like it, but for me it's a solid but ultimately uninspiring game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's very nerve-wracking when you're trying to decide whether to put off investing for "one more round" and then hoping that stinkin' score card doesn't come up before it gets around to you. The UP cards seem pretty powerful, but they're finite so it forces you to make even more choices. I wish it were in print.

Irresistible.  Can&#039;t legitimately argue that the design is superior or that luck is a non factor, but there is so much tension via calculated risk taking (OK - outright gambling) that the game is always fun to play. You have a tough decision to make every turn. Contrary to what you may have heard, a majority stake in U.P. shares does not equall victory (about 1/2 the time, in my experience).  Highly re-playable game - different every time.

It's got a lot to like; good production values, simple rules, the game is close right to the end. It took a few games for it to really draw me in, but it now comes out more often than Acquire.

La mejor característica de este juego es que es uno de los pocos que brilla por igual a 3,4,5 y 6 jugadores. Es poco inmersivo y se hace un poco largo, pero es un buen juego para cuando se juntan 6 personas y hay ganas de algo más que un filler.

This game seems like it's trying to meld Ticket to Ride with Acquire and fails at doing so.  The Union Pacific cards are WAY too powerful and if you don't get the most of them, you probably aren't winning.  I don't feel like I'm investing in railroads.  I don't feel like I'm laying track.  I just didn't like it and won't be in a rush to play it again...ever.

A lot of people seem to compare this to Acquire.  While I see a superficial resemblance, it really does not strike me as being much like Acquire at all -- mainly because I like this game and can win at it.  I like the tension between choosing to build & acquire stock and laying down your cards.  Throwing the UP cards in there only makes it more interesting.  The track cards seem almost superfluous.  Generally, I have been able to play what I want, when I want.  When this has not been the case, it can be extremely annoying.  I'm not really sure why it is.  It doesn't actually seem to encourage building certain lines over others, at least in my experience.  This is the only "economic" game that I get.  Maybe it's the trains.

1 play. 6 player. Probably not an ideal game to learn with 6 players, most of them new to the game. It took over 2 hours. Depsite that, I enjoyed it very much. It is, as so many have remarked, a cross between Acquire and a simple rail game. Pretty neat and I'll gladly play it again. Should be much quicker with experienced players and 3 or 4 players instead of 6.

Most recent and only play 8-12-05 at Michael's game night.

RATING: 7.5
Not a train game but a stock acquisition game. This is Moon's nod to Sackson's Acquire. Players either place tracks to increase the values of different train companies on the board and draft a stock card or put down stocks to claim position in companies for a payout when 1 of 5 dividend cards are drawn.

There is delicious tension: do you continue to grow companies or try to increase their values? Sometimes, it's better to piggyback and be second in a company instead of being first!

It would play better if 20 minutes could be shaven off the play time.

One of my all time favourite.  The random end is what makes me love this game.  There is always a constant excitement as you go through the game, wondering if someone will take over your train colour or not.  The end is usually a surprise. Though we love this game, this for sure is one of THE most confusing games to explain ever, especially to non-gamers.

I was disappointed in this game. Surprisingly, the train theme actually feels stronger in Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 8
This is the game I hoped Ticket to Ride would be - before I had ever played either of them, or any of Alan Moon's designs for that matter. In UP, players are trying to make the most money in each of four dividend rounds (scoring rounds), finishing the game with the most millions. On a turn, you have two choices: build a railroad route for one of 10 companies OR vest stock shares in one or two of those companies by playing cards from your hand to the table. Various factors contrain your options in both cases. But you absolutely must balance building beneficial routes with investing, for if you fail to invest in a timely manner, a dividend round can occur - leaving you out in the cold. And the four dividend cards are semi-randomly located in the share deck - drawing a dividend card signals an immediate scoring round. The only gripe I have about UP is that it can be difficult to displace an early leader. It can be done through careful play. Some people complain that the game goes on a little too long, but I find that even when it does take 2.5 hours to play a game, I am engaged the entire time. Downtime has never become a serious issue for us, and you are constantly figuring out what to do next. I'm still not certain as to how many viable *different* strategies there are to win, and resolving that question will (in the long run) determine where my rating goes.

UPDATE: UP has left the limbo of a 9 rating to settle at 8. I really like the game and always have fun playing it, but am disheartened that it is *so* difficult to knock out a strong, early leader. Because initial vested shares are determined by a random draw, it's often the case that one person has an early monopoly on one of the smaller railroads (light blue, orange, etc.). If one player has a monopoly on two of these in the early game, they can translate that into overall victory without too much difficulty. Even the most savvy play is often incapable to displacing a strong, early leader in UP - as such a lead is really for the leader to lose, and barring idiotic mistakes the lead won't be lost. So even though I enjoy playing the game, oftentimes playing past the second scoring round seems academic.

Union Pacific has great tension, an excellent mix of strategy and tactics, and it light enough so that you don't have to relearn the system or rules every time you play. While UP isn't a brain burner, it does reward planning and intellectual flexibility, and of course, it's just plain fun. 3-5 players is the sweet spot here, even though it can be played with 2 or 6. 4 players seems ideal to me, with 3 and 5 being only slightly less sublime - and really, playing with 6 is still good. It's hard to believe this game is OOP, I'm glad I was able to get a copy from the Netherlands. It was worth the hassle.

I placed 3rd tonight in a 5 player game. Again, I don't like the random game end condition. I'd prefer to let everybody play out the entire game and see how it all falls out. I'll play it again AFTER I read the rules. It was another game of "Two peeps have played it once and neither remembers the rules." We seemed to get through it OK. As far as I know, we were all playing by the same rules. :) However, I liked it and it's something a newbie gamer would enjoy, which is always a plus. It's a sort of melding game, where the more shares of company stock you meld to the table, the better your chances of scoring that company's major dividend. However, you also have to build track, because the money you earn when dividends are paid is equal to the length of track that company has built. So, you could have 5 shares of a company's stock in front of you, but if the company only has two track segments built, you may score the major dividend, but it will be a small dividend. So, there's a balance between building and investing. The Union Pacific company operates a little differently. There are 20 shares available. Everybody starts with 1 share. At the end of a turn in which you build track, you can trade in 1 share of any other stock from your hand for a share of the UP. The share you trade in goes out of the game. Since UP shares pay off the best at the end of the game, it is wise to get in on the rush for those shares at the beginning of the game. Chances are, that will decide the game, as it did in this one. Again, nice game. It was pretty quick for 5 people. After we got past the initial rules thing, it took a little over an hour to play.

Got to play for the first time with a new group.  Very fun game to play even as a new player.  Easy to pick up the flow of the game.  Looking forward to the next play.

Many plays at WBC.  After my first play I rated it around an 8 and put it 10 in my top ten.  After 3 more plays, the game continues to grow on me and I've upgraded it.

Taught the wife - she is a fan now as well.  Holds up remarkably well after numerous plays.

I had been looking for a train game that would be one step above Ticket to Ride Europe.  I thought that that game would either be Railroad Tycoon or Ticket to Ride Marklin or even Empire Builder, but I think that I'll have to go with this one.  The game was tense, but it didn't seem overly luck heavy.  I've heard that the game doesn't play well with too many players.  The game seemed to have a real "push your luck" feel in my opinion.

Átmenet a Ticket to Ride és a Chicago Express társasjátékok között. Nem nehezebb, mint a TTR, de több dologra kell figyelni benne, a CE-nél viszont azért könnyedebb. Úgy érzem jól eltalált a nehézsége. A játék jól pörög, gyors, nincs sok holtidő, így talán még 6 játékos esetén sem vészes míg újra rád kerül a sor. A játékosok részvényeket szereznek a vasúttársaságokban és ezek vonalait építik, majd a 4 véletlenszerű időben feljövő pontozáskor minden társaságban többséggel és második hellyel pénzt szereznek. Vagy társaságot bővítünk vagy részvényt játszunk ki a körünkben. A játék előnye az akár 6 játékos lehetősége, ami ha nem is szükséges, de mindenképp sokan jó leülni a játékhoz. Legalább 4-en, de valószínűleg 5-en idális. 3-an is játszható, de többen az izgalmas. Jó játék az Union Pacific, aki egy kis továbblépésre vágyik a TTR után, annak bátran ajánlható.

RATING: 8.5
Yes, this game is as good as everyone says it is.  Sure, you can get some unlucky draws, and get completely hosed, but the tension is always high and the game has you gripped by your short hairs.  Perhaps the top cards should equal twice the number of players so that the first two people don't have a potential scoring advantage. 

I think Get the Goods is boring as all hell.  The board makes a huge difference for me, it is entirely possible to get closed out of rail, I think that people that aren't aware of this aren't taking advantage of the board's positioning power.  While the track cards are a little clunky they make a significant change in how you play and what you invest in.  These make the decisions much tougher.  We decided that there should be an expletive phase, as at least once one their turn someone churns out filthy shouts at the game or another player.  

UPDATE: After playing Airlines, I think it is the better game, but only by a margin.  I'll still play either.

Absolutely fantastic train game, a bit like Chicago Express meets Ticket to Ride. It's much meatier and more interesting than TTR, but luckier and less mechanical than CE. Each turn is an agonizing decision--do I lay track, increasing the value of my stock and drawing another share to play later, or do I lay out some shares to strengthen my portfolio before the next dividend? And laying out shares is not easy either. Do I want to add a little mojo to two different stocks, or a lot of mojo to just one? And what about the UP shares--when do I need to get those down on the table? An excellent game that really deserves a new edition.

I always enjoy this game, which is a 6-player standby in our group. At the same time, I am always annoyed by the fact that the the track cards and geography have so little significance. Acquire has a cleaner design, but maybe UP has the edge in fun just because of the tension involved in never knowing when the payouts are coming.

A simpler train game including a stock market aspect (that is quite unusual, it's basically a pure majority mechanic!) The types of track are a bit hard to differentiate (seems more complicated than it needs to be!). Also, the game (at least our first game) took longer than I hoped this game to be. (I hoped to be able to play UP in significantly shorter time than games like Chicago Express, Steel Driver, Volldampf; because if I don't, there's no point in playing UP if you can play CE!) We'll see how long future games will take...

Fun, but not sure I like the sudden scorings in the basic game. Played a 2er where we used the variant of semi-regular scoring (6 cards with the score card shuffled, then 18 cards shuffled, alternately stacked on top of each other) which worked well. Need to play with more people, though - not as much fun with 2.

I've introduced this game to several people, and almost all of them didn't just like it, they REALLY like it.  So much so that I can barely get my family to play anything else.  Every turn presents agonizing decisions and you really need to make it count.  I'm always curious to see what my opponents do on their turns, probably more so than any other game.  Therefore, the entire game is exciting, even when it's not your turn!  Incidentally, I don't think this game is nearly as difficult to explain as I've heard.

Acquire with trains, now by Alan Moon. It has that typical Alan Moon-dilemma between ensuring short-term gains and investing for bigger long-run payoffs. I really like this, especially with 4 or 5. Six is a bit too much I think, while with 3, the competition is sometimes lacking.

Brilliant game!  The semi-random payouts and endgame add to the already delicious tension throughout the game.

The decisions seem simple, and many of your decisions are limited by the game's mechanics.  I enjoy playing, but don't consider this to be a great game by any stretch.  

Furthermore, I do not believe this game works well with 5 or 6 players.  To me it seems you do not have enough turns before the scoring begins. Finally the deck construction is contrived and unabalnces the game, allowing some players to have more turns than other between scoring rounds.  The game does not reward long term planning.  

Lowered yet another notch, just too much randomness in the deck construction to be tolerable for me.

I like this game for a medium light train game.  

Better with a variant where you pay  $1000 * the number of scoring cards pulled for jumping over the face up cards and taking a pull from the stock deck.  So before the first scorint car it is free.

After the first scoring card it get progressivel expensive to go to the deck for a random pull.

Rating revised downwards after reading from the designer that Airlines, the predecessor to this game, was inspired by Acquire.  I'll never understand how people can play this game over Acquire.  Theme:  tacked-on.  Gameplay:  dry, no player interaction.  Length:  1 hour too long.  Style of play it encourages:  quiet staring at the board, then boredom as out-of-turn players begin to wonder how they got sucked into such a dull exercise.  Winning strategy:  collect UP stock, occasionally play a few regular line cards down, guaranteed 1st or 2nd place finish.  Monopoly is better than this.

A good economical train game, easy to learn and with stock holdings mechanic similar to Acquire. If played with more than 4 players it may be result too slow during game progress avoiding possibility for players doing enough actions and falling in a lower tension game. Last two games in three players were much more interesting than any others done with six players with high tension factor and good game control.

Too bad the artwork is so ugly, this game deserves much better.

The game has a higher luck factor than I would prefer though. Having the share you're looking for turned over just before your turn is sometimes a huge advantage. One share more or less can have quite an impact on your points, but (not) getting that share can be a bit too lucky.

1999 Spiel des Jahres runner up. 

After playing Wabash/Chicago Express, I find myself frustrated by this game. They both scratch a very very similar itch, but CE is clearly superior in nearly every way. Problems I have with UP:
- UP stock is unbalanced unless you play with unlimited stock
- Randomness of the stock cards can keep you from getting a stock you need, thus a severe lack of control.
- Length of the game is a bit long for what you get out of it.

Honestly, if I hadn't actually worked for Union Pacific, I'd trade this game away.

RATING: 5
Union Pacific is a cross between Ticket to Ride and Acquire.  It has the set collection and train placement aspect of Ticket to Ride with the stock investment and majority/minority aspect of Acquire.  

Unfortunately, I think Union Pacific loses the best aspects of both games.  It doesn't have the route building of Ticket to Ride or other train games, and it doesn't have the mergers and acquisitions that Acquire does so well.

Stock market games generally aren't my cup of tea.  Union Pacific doesn't come close to Acquire or even Stock Pile as a stock market game.  While it does have trains, it doesn't come close to Ticket to Ride or Railways of the World as a train game.  It's a hybrid that doesn't capture the best parts of the genres it is trying to combine.

One other gripe was that the graphic design is pretty poor.  Twice in the game I thought a card was for a different stock than it actually was (red vs orange vs brown were similar, white vs gray were similar), and those mistakes cost me a ridiculous number of points and took me out of the game.

Rating has slipped slightly over the years. It's still playable and still fun, but a lot of great mechanics and designs have come out in the decade since UP was released, and I just don't have the desire to play this as much as I once did. Even so, it remains an innovative classic in my mind and I have certainly enjoyed my many hours playing this Union Pacific.

I have no idea why I like this game so much, but I do. Sadly, the others in my regular gaming group don't, so I don't get to play it. In fairness, it has some flaws and a random element that can screw you over, but they are easily fixed with a couple of house rules. It's worth noting that most of the problems are fixed in Airlines of Europe.

RATING: 6
First of all, the whole UP stock thing just seems silly to me. You can&#039;t win without UP stock, so you don&#039;t really have any choice about whether to collect it. Since games are all about nail-biting choices, this is to me a broken mechanic. Aside from that, the whole &quot;placing trains&quot; mechanic isn&#039;t that entertaining of an addition. Sure, there&#039;s opportunities to block opponents with the right placement, but not many. In my opinion, UP is just a stock game with two dreary mechanics tacked on. I&#039;d rather play Acquire or Shark, two games that never feel dreary to me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Main beef I have with the game is that it is clearly not clearly arranged. Really, did they have to make the rail tracks this way? You can hardly tell them apart, especially on the board. Colors would have been better. Also it' s a really long snooze fest. The good about it is, that the game is really tight and players' scores are very close to one another.

We've played with both a fixed number of UP stock and the "unlimited UP" variant - with only 5 plays under my belt, I don't know that I have a preference.  The agony of pushing your luck as you wait for the "trigger card" to come is a joy.

RATING: 8
Fun set collection, stock majority game. Lots to consider strategically and tactically throughout the game, but it never feels heavy. The semi-random placement of the scoring cards adds just the right amount of tension and excitement. Some might think the UP shares are overpowered, but I don't think so.

RATING: 7
A stock game where the players have pieces of information in which to base their selections on.  Number of cards, players invested, time investment needed to return dividends, number of possible links, all aid in assisting the players on which choices to make.  The stock placement slowing down your track building and stock acquisition, but the stocks do not score until they are face up creates quite a bit of angst with the random scoring.  It creates a constant press your luck with the deck, and brinksmanship with your opponents.  And oh those Union Pacific stocks, just plain ole neat. 

Bumped down to a 7 because I'd rather play Airlines Europe.

This is an older game that is apparently fairly rare these days.  I'd played the reimplemented version Airlines Europe, and knew that this was somewhat similar.

It's essentially the same game with a few tweaks.  One of the biggest differences is that the board is divided up into different rail types and you draw and play rail cards in order to build routes.  Certain companies can only build on certain types of track.  Dividend payouts are related to how many routes have been built for each company.  Airlines Europe chucks the whole "type of rail" section of the game and opens up the entire board to players.  It also uses a different dividend system, where each route space has number that bumps that company up the share track, which has banded dividend payout ranges.  So while in UP you might build a track for a company you don't like in a way that limits it's growth potential, in AE you could do the same thing, but force it to take a low number spot... spoiling it's chances to hit the higher dividend payout brackets.

There are a few other differences but that's the big one.  Overall the games aren't really that different.  I prefer the train theme of UP but prefer the way AE ditches the track deck aspect of UP.

Varias compañias de tren. Cada una utiliza un tipo de vias. Puedes colocar tren de la compañia que quieras o bajar acciones para apostar. Cuando sale la carta de dividendo del mazo, de cada compañia el que mas acciones tiene se lleva mas dinero, y despues el segundo. Las acciones de union pacific son genricas. Cuando sale la cuarta carta de dividendo termina el juego. Es bueno, como el ticket to ride pero mejor

Acquired 25 Apr 2005 from Geese.  Wow!  This is one heck of a good game, mixing the stock elements of Acquire with the blocking techniques of Ticket to Ride while tossing in random scoring and end game points just to make it _really_ interesting.  Not as accessible as TtR, but this Moon offering will keep more serious gamers much happier.  Being able to play with 6 (where as TtR is limited to 5) is just gravy.

I started playing this once before, but we had to end the game early.  I finally got another chance to try a three player game of it.  Its a nice stock game that I think I like better than Acquire, which is about the only other stock game I have played.  I did have a run of bad luck in my game, but maybe I could have played more offensively.  When other players were catching up to my best stocks and I couldn't get the card I needed for defense, I probably could have made better choices about what alternate stocks to play.

Got at BGG.con flea market for $25.

A whole lotta fun! And a whole lotta work: so much here that is just not elegant... the most obvious complaint is that the scoring itself is cumbersome and long. But yet, I loved, loved, loved the game! The desire to pull shares, lay down shares, grow track, grab Union Pacific Cards, get sneaky, be obvious, scare others off your interests, and more(!) all while there is this ticking time bomb of the scoring card crawling closer and closer to the top of the deck is just gaming nirvana for me. But then that scoring card actually comes up and the brute force arithmatic for scoring 10 or 12 (?) different railroad companies is like nails down the chalkboard-- it is the screeching of a boring job or doing your taxes. If inside the box, Rio Grande had packed a lilliputian bookkeeper who tabulated the score on a tiny abacus and let the players keep playing right on through the dividends, this game would certainly be a 10  for me. But with needing to actually bring the gameplay to a halt three times (and a 4th time to end the game) to spend 5 minutes doling out money brings it down a bit. But of all the games I have rated an 8, this is probably the one I wish most that it could be perfect simply because what it does right is so absolutely great!

I was alittle slow to warm to this game. After one play, I enjoyed it but it failed to register. However after seeing our local gaming group were playing it every time we stopped in ( 2 visits in 8 months!), our weekly group tried it again. What a great game! My suggestions to anyone who didn't give the game time to grow (I know so many games so little time!), try it again. It is really very accessible and seems better with every replay. Perhaps ,not immediately so but, definitely great.

Easy comparisons are to [gameid=9209] or [gameid=5], but I find this game head and shoulders above both of them.  Balancing conservative vs. aggressive play is a must, and there's a ton of agonizing decisions in this one.  Can I really afford to leave that Denver Midland card on the table for a possible competitor to scoop up?

A train game with the choice of building or buying stocks. 

Take a railway card and build a train of your choice. After that you take a stock for free and you can exchange of your stockcards for an union pacific card. 

or 

Build 2 different stockcards or more then 1 card from the same kind. 

4 times in the game points are given. The person with the most stocks of 1 kind get the number of trains in points, the person with the second most stocks gets half of that amount. From round 2 Union Pacific cards also raise a lot off points.

Good game, not to hard but Union pacific cards are very generous in points. Maybe nerve them?

Conceptually the type of game I would like but executed IMHO poorly.

I feel the tension could have been implemented so much better... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is one of those games that takes the potential for agonizing decisions and turns them into moments of frustration, instead.  If you don't draw the right cards, then you're not going to be able to make the right connections.  If you don't have that extra piece of UP stock, then you're not likely to win the game.  The designer made an effort to eliminate some of the randomness, but it still seems like some of the most important decisions of the game are left up to the card deck, or turn order.  It does have its moments, but overall, it's just not my kind of game.

4 plays: 6 players

There are two things I love here: First, you have no idea when the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th scoring rounds will occur; and second, the tension between laying a train and picking up a card or playing your stock. Both these factors create a delicious tension. I love this game.

Union Pacific was one of the first 'German' style games after Settlers I played. As a starting gamer at that time I enjoyed this game immediately. The tension of "when will the dividend ticket show up" combined with "shall I expand railroad(s) or play my shares" is just great. I always try to withhold specific railroad shares (for example yellow), let other people build that line and try to play these shares before the second dividend card shows up. The look on other people faces if you succeed... It's a great 'gateway' game for new players and I know enough experienced players who like to play this game on a regular base!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've no idea how anyone can enjoy this without the balanced shuffling variant.  There is a distinct early player advantage that should've been accounted for (cf. Alhambra for how to do this right, or at least better). On the plus side, it's easy for non-gamers to get into (apart from the dumb track deck), and has great graphics.

RATING: 5
Interesting stock game with railroad building component.  Feels a little uncontrolled (random payout) especially with 6 players.  With so many different train companies and track types,  there's a lot to keep track of.  Lots of the colours are the same,  and it took a bit before I realised that the centre line of the track (or lack thereof) denoted the track type.

Significantly less enamored with this on second play.  You only pick up one stock at a time, so you should be able to tell how many everyone has of each type (except for their starters) -  I dislike card counting.  Everyone seems to end up with about equal stock holdings,  it seems a bit of a matter of micro-opimisiation/luck whether you have the slightly better set.  And I dislike games where certain things must be done otherwise things break - here,  you must make sure you don't get shorted a UP stock at the beginning,  or else you take a pretty big penalty and you give others a pretty big boost.

very good game, a lot of tension, a lot of though decisions, good vibrations. The game play itself is repetitive but the fact that you always want to do 2 actions but you can do only one makes the game flow always interesting.
One note: you must play with a different setup. 5 equal decks, the last four each containing one scoring card.
very enjoyable!

I had this game sitting on my shelf for over a year before I finally decided to give it a go. It was love at first play. Union Pacific is a great combination of both strategic and tactical play, and it's easy enough for people to understand after just a few rounds. Ideal game for people who've already played TtR and want a different flavor to their meal. Only downside is that the game lasts a bit too long for its depth.

At this point I would like to re-get this game - it's a type that is missing in my collection and I recall it played well with 6.

'17/07/06: I now have Airlines Europe, and while it doesn't play with 6 it seems to me a much better implementation of the system.

One of the better games of this type.  And, the best-designed internal box layout I've seen.  Many games have issues with lots of little pieces that they either give you baggies or an unorganized compartment or 2.  Glad I got this one before it went out of print.

Great game. 6 players is a bit too many, but it does still work. Lots of delicious decisions in this game.

UPDATE: 271009 The more I play this the better it gets. Moon's best stock game. Moons best train game. Rolled into one! and a very decent playing time of about 90mins!
Ratings seem to be going up these days but I'm in no way being generous when I notch this game to the 10 where it belongs!

played three times now. great game. would definitely play this over acquire. a popular crossover for gamers and casual gamers alike...4th game, scoring seems to be getting tighter...players very competitive...not sure how long i can ... hold..on..to..this winning...streak...Don't know how many times I've played and the winning streak as vanished..but my HUGE appreciation for this game lives on.

Original comment:

A "6" rating assumes the unlimited UP stock variant is in effect.  A "4" with the original rules.

The availability of particular stock on your turn is critical, and therefore frustrating.  It can also be unfun to draw useless track cards turn after turn.

Update:

I'm don't know what I was thinking.  I don't care for this game period, with or without the unlimited stock variant.  There's nothing more frustrating than watching a competitor make a dramatic comeback due to the fact that they luck into just the right stock at just the right time.

RATING: 7.5
Played several times (with 4 to 6 players). A nice share-holding game disguised as a train game. It has its drawbacks (unpredictability of the scorings, low interest of the track cards - they do not feel very useful to me, and the appearance of the board, which seemed ok before Ticket to Ride), still the game is tense and enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good light to medium game.  Rules are easy to explain.  There is a rummy-like component.  The player has more control over his fate than in, say, Ticket to Ride.  Good for both gamers and non-gamers.

Lighter than its rulebook and share portfolio theme would suggest and quite fun. Games can get tense with some players hoping for a dividend payout to appear while others wish it to be delayed.

Okay, it was only my first play, but this game is awesome. Difficult decisions, agonizing tension and smooth gameplay make this game truly a classic. If you enjoy train games or stock games, this is possibly the best of both worlds.

Suffers from attack left strategy problems, UP is too strong, but plastic trains are so fun.

RATING: 7
Smart game where you constantly have to choose between expanding a train track, or playing more stock-cards. Scoring cards show up unannounced, so you want a solid lead in stock cards, but you also want that train company to have a big network.

Great stock holding game, much better than Acquire.  Easy to learn middle-weight game, plays quickly but has enough meat to it.  Playing with unlimited UP stock is a must.  I might be biased because I love stock ownership, but I can't wait to play again.

(Trade Interest: low, offervalue: 60) not quite sure what to think of this one yet.  it seemed like it could be fun, given a few plays.  after a few more plays, i am worried that the sheer randomness of the share cards plays too big a part.  many times a game, the share card i've been looking for, shows up just after my turn.  not sure where i can improve my game, so something must be wrong with it.

Ticket to Ride with stock shares minus the importance of route building... OR ...a lighter version of Steel Driver without direct control of companies and no endgame position bonuses...

RATING: 8.5
My favorite "train game" that's not really a train game -- it's a stock/investment game. Visually gorgeous. Some luck of the draw, but I feel it's easier to handle than in Ticket to Ride. More going on than might first appear.

I'm convinced that the UP stock is too powerful but I've only played 6 player games (and lots of 'em.)  Still, not knowing when that final golden train turns up makes for some great gaming tension.

Weee! I can't get enough of this one. The theme feels fun, and there's a lot of depth to the play mechanics. Definitely the best games are to be had with the full 6 players. Yay for Alan Moon and his little plastic trains!

A fairly good time.  Seems to me like a mix of acquire and ticket to ride.

RATING: 7.5
A very TTR-esque game with a few different mechanics.  Instead of destination tickets you have stocks, and rather than colored train cards there are rails.  I think it's different enough for me to appreciate the subtlety even after burning out of TTR, but again it can be real streaky due to the luck in the draw, sometimes you just can't get the kind of rails you need to invest in the company you want, or if you don't get the correct color stock to maintain your control.  I still like it though.

Wow.  Delicious decision-making.  This game gives Alan Moon a second chance in my book after playing (and being underwhelmed by) Elfenland.  Lots of tension and agonizing choices; just what I look for in a game.

A great business oriented game for people who don't want to play Monopoly. It's one of the few I think I can introduce to any group of people. It has just enough decision making to be interesting but not overwhelming.

As good as a stock-buying game can get, imo.  

One complaint: the different types of railroad tracks look too much alike.

RATING: 6.8
I like the various mechanisms Moon has in this game, and it provides a nice suspenseful choice each round of whether to invest your shares less efficiently than you could next turn, in order to have them should a scoring come up, or try to gain that efficiency.  Not to mention a little sneaky stock posturing, of course.

After 2+ Plays: Does the stock mechanic well.  By that I mean the stocks are clearly the focus of the game, and what's going on on the board is simple enough not to steal focus from the stocks (Unlike, for example, [gameid=24181])

An excellent stock-holding game that feels a little like Ticket to Ride with a couple of degrees of complexity/strategy added in. My only complaints are the paper money (though it's barely handled) and the track cards can be a bit difficult to tell apart, especially the regular track vs. the dark line track.

GAME: Dungeons & Dragons: Rock Paper Wizard
RANK: 2515
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a light party game.  But it's very fun.  It's more strategic than it appears on first play.  I think some people are turned off by the luck-party game aspect of aiming your attacks that can be redirected, but if you think a few steps ahead it can be really rewarding.

But it's a party game, make no doubt about it.  Lots of take that, it's all take-that really!  But it's....again....a light party game.  Kids around 4th grade seem to pick it up even if the strategy is definitely adult-level.

I love that everyone is constantly playing - no one is really waiting around.  Turns happen basically together.  Games are shorter 20-30m.  

Imagine paper-rock-sissors with 10x the options for "attacks" and then instead of 1v1 it's all vs. all and you can aim your attacks at anyone you want.  Great party free-for-all game that does have some strategy.  For $15.00 it's a steal.

To make it better, bring your own mini to use instead of the cardboard stand-ups that come with the game.

A 15-30 minute game of throwing hand gestures at your former wizard allies turned opponents as you try to nab as much money from a dragons horde.

This game supports a simple design and has a small amount of strategy based off of the revolving turn order and spell resolution.

Got this as one of the goodies from the Dice Tower Cruise 2017. No interest in this game as we only have enough players when family is over and is not the type of game we'd play with them. Traded away.

Another hit in the new D&D game line. Fun party game which hits the table regularly! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really enjoyable and very accessible to everyone. The box is tiny and well packed for how good the game is, so it's unlikely to ever leave my shelf. Some people may hate the ability to kingmake in this, but I think it's a crucial part of the game and doesn't make it less fun. 

My one criticism is some of the player characters on the board look quite similar at a glance, and so whilst the artwork is very cool, they could be more distinct.

Played with 5, pretty fun mix on take that. Definitely think I enjoy this more than Munchkin but feels like it would be better with 3/4 people. Slight analysis paralysis with the changing gestures, but got better once you've seen everything once.

Played the prototype with Jay and thought it is fun! Just played again recently with 2 other, and we all had a great time. The interactions can be a bit confusing, but overall, a great filler to start or end the evening. Can be played with kids over the age of 8.

RATING: 7.5
I think this game improves upon Cash and Guns by removing the player elimination, adding self-balancing mechanics in the form of green cards and adding another layer to the Simultaneous Action Selection in the form of Wild Surges (which may be advantageous to intentionally cause). However, I have seen that, particularly with lower player counts, it is very possible for other players to decide who will win the game by over-targeting the lead player (or not targeting the lead player in a win scenario)

Reminds me of quite a few other games, but done better because of the link to D&D spells. I think most fans of D&D would enjoy it and its a silly way to pass the time.

Don’t be fooled, you will not be playing RPS at all here. You will, however, be throwing a lot of different hand gestures at other players, and, most probably, enjoy it a lot. 

Do not play in libraries. Does not include nuclear tanks.

Not a bad game, but not great either.  Gameplay feels very random and it feels like a "richer get rich" problem since being in the lead often means you stay in the lead unless a proper spell shows up.

For a light filler game, games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong do a far better job with far more interesting gameplay.

You don't need to be a D&D fan to enjoy this.  Once the concept is understood, games go pretty quick.  For the younger kids (under 10), it is difficult for them to pick a gesture and stick to it, switching quickly after seeing what everyone else threw.  Once he grasped this concept, it went a lot smoother.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's pure chaos at hig player counts, but I must say flinging hand gestures at other players can be extremely satisfying. Not a game I'll break out very often, but I like owning it for the novelty, if nothing else.

Fun and quick. Have to pay attention to turn order and predict moves - if both players use same move on eachother RANDOM spells will be cast. Use hand signals to cast spells and push your opponents back in the dungeon so you get all the loot. Good player interaction would play again :).

RATING: 7
Good, chaotic fun.  I would consider this an improvement on the Cash 'n' Guns model.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rock Paper Wizard is a little bit like Cash'n'Guns meets RPS. There's a row of spells on display, which are the available hand signs you can use for the round and they do various things. Each round one will drop off and another will be added. Everyone simultaneously displays one of the "spells" (hand signs) aimed at someone. Then things resolve in turn order from the start player. The goal of the game is to get 25 coins which is an insta-win (unless there is a tie). The main way to get coins is to be closest to the treasure hoard at the end of a round. Most of the spells move you towards or away from the treasure hoard, although the spells that are the most fun are the ones that do ranom odd stuff and cause chaos.

This seems like a game that is most fun with a lot of players and is mostly enjoyable in a "Let's laugh at how horribly things go wrong" kind of way.

Why they needed to theme this D&D, I'll never know.  Other than the names of spells, there wasn't much to cue you in to the fact that this was in the D&D universe.

A nice filler game which I have owned now if they were not sold out at Essen 2016.
The most interesting spells are the complicated ones where the target shifts. I would have liked more of those.

RATING: 8
Very fun, very fast game - however it works best with either 3 players for hardcore bluffing and guessing, or 5 players for fun mayhem without being too unpredictable (like with 6 players).

Great, entertaininng use of the DnD license, and thoroughly unexpected.

After sleighing the big baddy, the fantasy heroes turn on each other to grab the biggest share of the loot by using expanded rock-paper-scissor hand guestures to blast spells at each other.

A fun light game that takes the rock, paper, scissors mechanic everyone knows, but gives it fun powers that change each round. Plus when the chaos magic happens it's just fun cause you never know what crazy spell is going to happen instead.

RATING: 7.5
Simple yet fun. It won't take you long to learn the game, so you'll be able to quickly hop in for some fun. It's a game that you'd play with a bunch of friends in a board game night where you cycle trough small games (like werewolf, secret Hitler and other games like that.) In this game you need to take in consideration who plays first and who is most likely to do which action, since it can greatly affect you.

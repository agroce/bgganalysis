It's a fun game. Simple game that reminds me a little of Ticket to Ride (the drafting and quick turns). One thing is that it seems we were playing it somewhat wrong (several rules), so I'm not sure how accurately I can rate it. Still, overall, it's a simple game and fun, although the attack cards can be pretty powerful and I felt they were a bit game-breaking.

The art work and graphic design of this game are very good. The production quality of the components are top notch. But there's something about the game play that has us scratching our head. At its heart madame Ching is a card driven race game with a set collection aspect that makes for an okay game. But not a great one. We wish there was something more to this. But it just doesn't match up to Jamaica which is the best racing game out there.

Navigation Numeric Card Game. Very family but a bit cold. You have to make series of numeric carde, a not so much 'adventurer mechanic'. Kind of boring for me, although Cathala is one of my favourite authors by the way.

1 játék - 4 játékos
Kifejezetten kellemes meglepetés volt ez a játék. Bár a grafikai világ nem áll annyira közel hozzám, a játék menete, annál inkább. Van benne szerencse, de valahogy mégis fel lehet használni taktikailag a feljövő lapokat. Mindig az aktuális helyzethez kell igazodni és vannak jó kis lehetőségek az ellenfél megfékezésére, ha esetleg mégsem tudunk olyan jól haladni a játékban. Egy picit konfrontatív a játék, de nem annyira, hogy különösebben a játék élmény elvenné azoktól, akik ezt nem szeretik. Bátran ajánlom egy könnyed játéknak, bár alapvetően nem olyan rövid.

I like this game quite a bit: Take the idea of Keltis or Lost Cities and drive you Junk(boat) to the best possible spot to gather mission value tiles. Use special abilities to go further or to disrupt your fellow players in gathering the most gems. It can feel that it plays itself at times especially the very beginning.However the brilliance shows itself as the engine builds. This one is a keeper and will see multiple plays. It's not a heavy game by any stretch it's lite and I like that in this game. Plays quick. You will need to check back to the book on special abilities until you get used to them.

Juego sencillo y familiar pero con cierto componente estrategico y bastante divertido.
Mediante una mecanica de avanzar el barco similar al "Lost cities" hay que decidir hasta donde y como avanzar con nuestro barco para conseguir los tesoros y habilidades que nos dan los PV. A pesar de no haber recibido buenas criticas me parece un muy buen juego, en la linea de Jamaica o Histrio.

Delightful little card game with a neat, unusual pirate theme and absolutely stunning artwork. I agree that the two-player game is best, and also think the "draw 3 bonus cards" cards should be removed from the game. Otherwise, the game has a nice balance between pushing your own luck and trying to guess what your opponent will play. It's fast and plays quickly. Makes a great filler.

If you like Cargo Noir or Lost Cities, you owe it to yourself to try this game. If you don't like either of those, try Madame Ching anyway. There is so much here to like; I'm sure you can find something in it for you. Beautiful art, set collecting, chaining cards, deciding when to cut your losses and when to go for it, multiple paths to victory, great 2 player variant, nice bits. Who could want more?! It is a breeze to play once you have learned it. The rulebook makes it seem harder than it is. I am used to playing heavier games than this, but I was confused after reading the rulebook. I would recommend watching a video to help learn it. We watched the Dice Tower one, and it quickly cleared the confusion for me. Don't let anything keep you from playing this game. It is a must have!

Really enjoyed this as a 2-player game (can't comment on higher player counts, probably less strategic though).
Seriously disliked some of the cards though, very swingy, not very balanced (draw 3 more cards? seriously?  The "jokers" too... ).
Might need some house ruling to make it less frustrating in future plays...

Hand-management game in which players try to put together voyages that take their ships far across the waters, possibly all the way to Hong Kong. In Madame Ching, players take on the role of novice pirates, under the command of the most feared swashbuckler of the Asian isles herself, Madame Ching Shih. Players will embark on expeditions, attempting to complete missions for the lady captain, in which they will be rewarded gems, gold, and may even possibly be granted command of Madame Ching’s famous vessel, the China Pearl. Players will play a certain number of navigation cards from their hand during the course of the game, which will determine how their ship will move and how long a particular expedition will last. When choosing to complete an expedition, the player can complete a mission based on their final resting position on the game board map, and may also gain certain special bonuses if they were able to complete sets from the icons listed on their played cards. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is crowned Madame Ching’s most prized pirate, and the winner.

RATING: 4
Some great art and a potentially good theme, bungled by convoluted mechanics not justified by length or depth.  Some decisions are nicely-balanced (swing for Hong Kong, or rack up short expeditions?) but some of the encounter cards are made way too effective, while the skills/Pearl tree seem unlikely to get anywhere before someone else clears the last mission.  Expect frequent rule checks and clarifications.

There's a game in there and it might even be a good one even though the choices for the set collection part are severely restricted. It doesn't happen all that often that you can actually grab the cards you want on purpose. Still, that's okay for a family game. The bonus action cards, however, are ridiculously lopsided and clearly put this into "move on, nothing to see here" territory.

Klein-Patience meets abstraktes Laufspiel auf XY-achsigen, chinesischen Meer.

Elegant and beautiful racing game in the same vein as games like Lost Cities or Cartagena. Madame Ching has the distinct advantage that its gameplay is deeper, with multiple paths to victory and elements of engine building as your expeditions start small and as you progress, go further and get better at navigating. It is my opinion that the theme is well rendered for a family eurogame, as the Encounter and Skill cards make sense within the universe presented. The artwork from Vincent Dutrait is some of the best I've seen and it does help immerse you in the theme.

Comments that the game is too light, too random and decided by the luck of the draw are somewhat puzzling, indeed the rules are quite simple but the decision space is much deeper and subtle than meets the eye as the game does reward strategic planning through hand management, especially in the excellent 2-player version. I believe the most cunning player will prevail even if the other players are throwing a wrench in their work.

Fans of Reiner Knizia or Leo Colovini's work will surely enjoy this title. This game feels and plays like a good Spiel des Jahres contender.

Edit: Played a 4 player game where I kept getting hit and ended dead last. Still a very good game but this one session changed my view of the game. 2 players is the best version.

Liked it almost enough to play again right away... almost. The number of unresolved rules questions was what stopped us.

Pleasantly benign, with beautiful artwork. The strange diagonal pathway to earning victory points and/or bonuses takes some getting used to, and I suppose the game lacks another killer idea on top of that to make the experience seem like anything other than poking a game piece around a grid.

Ez egy igazán jó kis szórakozás, kettesben kiváló! Olvastam több helyen kritikát az encounter kártyákkal kapcsolatban, de egyrészt nem érzem, hogy egy könnyed és rövid kártyajátéknál szükség van komoly elemzésekre a lapok kiegyenlítettségével kapcsolatban, másrészt meg nálunk nem jelentkeztek olyan jellegű problémák, amire sokan panaszkodnak. Igen, lehet eléggé konfrontatívan játszani, és nyilvánvalóan van szerepe a szerencsének, de nálam a "kettesben fél óra" kategóriába bőven belefér ezek mértéke. A hangulata mindenesetre remek. :)

A great pirate themed game where you send ships on voyages using chains of numbered cards to collect the best loot possible, knowing when to cut a trip short and which cards to take from the pool are the key strategies here. The components are all great and it offers far more strategy than an initial glance might suggest, play time can run long with fewer players but turn-to-turn play moves at a nice fast speed.

I'm holding out a final score on Madame Ching as we feel like it's going to take us a few times playing it before we really grasp all the little nuances and mechanisms. The game is pretty, The flow is a little challenging at first as it's not really clear what all we do to get the path to victory we need to go on. 

It's fun - but has some gaps in its game play which makes it a little tough to score at this point. I'll revisit this after we've gone through it a few times.

A fine gateway game whose only fault really lies in it's over-production value. This would be a great tiny little card game with a small footprint. In that case it would be a keeper for sure. Now with a big box, I can't really grant it the shelf-space.

Looking forward to a Madame Ching the card game!

A neat gateway-level game with an interesting blend of hand management and push-your-luck mechanisms. There are a few different routes to getting points, and they all seem pretty viable. Obviously getting to Hong Kong is the best feat to pull off, but someone just spending time trying to complete quests still has a good shot at winning. The theme is almost nonexistent, but this is one of Cathala's better games, in my estimation. The artwork is gorgeous, and while the board feels more like a busy placeholder for most of the components than anything else, the presentation is very good.

It's impossible to play this game without thinking about Knizia's Lost Cities... indeed, if this came out as Lost Cities: The Board Game, no one would have flinched. I'm not sure that the additional rules and bonus cards piled on the design are an improvement, though, and I'm almost certain that the two-player variant, where a player controls two ships instead of one, is superior to the 3 or 4-player game.

People suggest to remove the Oracle draw-three cards (Oracles).

I did a solo learning game for four, and I'm worried the take-that stealing cards are too easy to acquire and play with no drawbacks.  

The movement and collecting of cards has an easy Ticket-to-Ride feel to it and the artwork is phenomenal as expected from that artist, but the game is not necessarily short enough for a light game nor serious enough for a light-to-medium game.  Hmmm...based on how the playing group received Libertalia, they might not be up to another game with mean cards.

I think Jamaica fills the pretty, light navigation theme game with mean-but-not-too-mean shenanigans.

A lot cleverer than it looks: plenty of careful timing required in the strategy, and the encounter cards are not as swingy as might originally appear, although getting an early navigation skill might be a dealbreaker. I love the one-upmanship of the cardplay, too: either play high to draw a premium card off the display or low to prolong your journey (with a not-insignificant element of push-your-luck). Put it all together with some smart and thematically appealing art, and you've got an excellent 45-minute game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really disappointed with this game. For such a beautiful production the game fell flat. The decision space was way to constricted. I never sought out another play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful artwork and high production values. I especially like the art on the movement cards.
- Ship movement; to me this is the most interesting part of the game.
- Hand management, planning how to play your cards to get your ship to where you want to go.
- The added set collection mechanic add some needed depth to the game, by offering a secondary goal when playing movement cards.

Overall I am somewhat underwhelmed by this game. It has such a beautiful aesthetic but the game play is quite repetitive. Some of the encounter cards can really swing a game and that doesn't feel fulfilling to me. Especially when the movement part of the game is so precise and requires careful planning. In the end I don't feel like the game rewards careful planning. Also your decisions are usually quite obvious, even for a family game.[/i]

A "The Works" sale item, these games have been a bit of hit and miss affair, so I approached playing this game with some trepidation. The rules of this game are very simple and streamlined. I couldn't believe that it was such a great tense game. Really enjoy it but I'd imagine that it will be hard to get others to play it, it has "The Works rejects" stigma.

Mechanically, this works perfect. The only thing I missed a bit in my 1 play, was a 'soul'. Most of the time 'nothing' happens: everybody moves a square and takes a new navigation card and that's it.

Edit 05/07/2014:I wrote the stuff above after one play and rated this game a 6. Then I played it again with 3 and it was an exciting, fast game, with end scores very close together. So I increased my rating to 7. But now I played it for the first time with 4 and in fact the stuff mentioned above applied again, so decreased rating to 6.5.

I guess that if this game is fun or not depends if 1 player is lucky (as well with encounter cards as navigation cards of the 'right' colour) or that luck is spread out evenly.

A fairly simple tactical card game where you want to send your ships as far as possible, but need to know when to cut a voyage short so you can be first to grab new cards or claim missions. There's a bit of luck involved in which voyage cards are revealed each round and which action cards you draw (which can range from powerful boosts to plain old VP). I small amount of cards have take-that effects, which I did not care for, but luckily other cards can cancel those out.

Madame Ching is especially good with two-players who will be splitting their hand of cards over two boats each, which adds a whole new layer of strategy to player order and when to end a voyage.

An absolutely beautiful game, and fun to top it off. We prefer this game most with two players - each player controls two expeditions instead of one and it's substantially more strategic than the three or four-player game. More players stays engaging because you're always scrapping for the one card you want but two players feels more like Ultra Rack-O.

RATING: 8
Beautiful artwork.  Game is really fun but we had to make a couple of house rules with the 2 player game.  (1) We draw a card then play a card.  For some reason we just couldn't get into the groove the other way around, I guess because most games you draw first then discard.  (2) We do not change turn order depending on who selects the highest card.  Feels too fiddly that way with just 2 players.  We just play back and forth with no turn order changes, with the second player always getting the last turn of the game.

Over all a great family style game that grows on you with repeated plays -with beautiful artwork and a fun theme.  Recommended.

An ok game. Very light, push your luck. Not much challenge, at least in a 2 player game. Might be better at higher player counts. Poorly written rules, though. So bad that 2 youtube tutorials, including one by a company rep, mess up at least one rule while teaching it. After you play it the game ends up being very simple. It would be easy to teach to new/non-gamers or in a game group.

One of those games that Works but just doesn't add up to enough fun. I design games like that myself; I get something up and ready and I look at it and say "yes, this is a game, it has rules, everything seems to work...but it doesn't make me want to play it." And then I put it behind me :whistle:

There isn't a better board game artist than Vincent Dutrait. His work adds a lot to many games I have played, and Madame Ching is no exception. Bruno Cathala/Ludovic Maublanc have designed a good game in its own right; but the art and production in general really brings a lot to the game. The basic flow of the game is quite similar to Lost Cities with the card play and progression. The encounter and skill cards add some good depth, as well as the "highest card goes first" rule. It's a good one!

Played once with 3P. The driving force behind Madame Ching's gameplay is the the concept of playing out a sequence of cards in ascending order to move along the board. The further your ship moves along the track, the better rewards you are able to cash out. But you have to pay attention to the suits of cards, and there are also times when you want to end your journey prematurely. The underlying gameplay is Knizia-esque in a good way – simple, abstract but with enough twists to give some bite.

However, the rating suffers because of two aspects. First, a few of the Encounter cards are able to swing the game too much in one direction, especially if they target a particular player. Blocking effects are included as a response, but I think the inclusion of these Encounters muddies an otherwise clean design. Second, the game felt a little stretched timewise given the depth of decisions offered. The overall package is mixed, although the amazing panoramas formed by the cards really deserve a mention.

Sort of a racing slash set collecting game. The racing aspect mainly comes from 'who can get the point cards first' because if you get to the same point value later, you will get less points.
The mechanism which determines your movement is kind of cool though not thematic at all.
There is a card in the game that gives 10 points. The 'splainer told me that if you get that card, you'll probably win. On my first trip I held back, building up a good hand for a longer second trip. I also managed to get two jokers. I ended up needing only one joker to get to the card, so I had plenty more options to do more stuff in the following rounds.
As predicted I did win, but even when deducting the 10 points card, I was still in a very comfortable lead because of the gems I collected, and the cards that boosted my points even more.
There is a very sizable luck factor. Both in the sailing cards you get and the bonus cards you get. If you don't mind that, the game is quite enjoyable, but with 4 it did go on for a bit too long.

Initial rating: 6.3/10

I've enjoyed a number of games from Messers Cathala and Maublanc and Hurrican are often one of the first ports I call at each Essen where's there often something of interest for me. Alas, Madame Ching does so much so well and then falls crushingly short at the last hurdle.

I love the push your luck and hand management of the voyages; the 'race' to collect scoring tiles and the mini-game of collecting the skills all work wonderfully together and really show the quality of the design and development team, but the special cards completely ruined the experience for me. In a game where our winner has fewer than 40 points, it is possible to score 1 point from a special card draw, or to effect a 15 point swing in your favour with a particularly lucky card draw. What an absolute shame. As I was playing this, I could feel the excitement rising as I felt I'd found a game well worthy of being added to my collection, but that came crashing down and I'm left disappointed. It's a great game with a massive flaw.

RATING: 7.5
The game looks gorgeous. Big fan of the lowest card laying mechanic. I actually think there’s a variety of tactics on offer here (in the few games that I have played); such as ending your missions early to swipe the lower mission tiles, thus forcing your rivals to complete longer missions.

I have made my own player aids, however. I felt that the cards are a little too vague for newbies to grasp, and having to take turns at checking each card’s ability in the rulebook is a mood-killer.

Gorgeous components highlight this unique card based game. There is drafting, set collecting, hand management and a bit of take that here - all implemented quite well.

Cards are played in a Lost Cities fashion, which procure ship movement. Most games are fairly tight and the length appears to be just right. The two player game, rather than being a watered down version, is actually very good and may even be a superior option to multiplayer. Recommend for fans of light games.

Rating this game is sort of tough. Based on my reduced rating scale, this game should not be a "4" as there are no major flaws, but does not deserve a "6" either. The first 10-15 rounds, I thought Madame Ching was undeservedly ignored by the masses. The mechanics of boat movement is quite refreshing and unique, albeit a little frustrating given how new cards were drafted into your hand. Increasing player interaction in the form of encounter cards and skills is not necessarily a bad idea even though it upped the "take that" quotient within the game. Finally, I was excited at the potential multiple paths to victory and one can choose between going for expeditions or focusing on encounter cards.

In the end, the biggest flaw of the game was the repetitive nature of simultaneous card play. It is true that the pace is rapid, but this just only contributes to the repetitive nature of each turn. All I remember each turn is play card face down, move boat, pick up new card. Rinse and repeat until an expedition is terminated. Then you get to start all over again. 

The game itself has no serious flaws, but I don't think I would actively chose to play it again..... which is a crying shame since the components, board and art is gorgeous and beautifully crafted. There is a reason why this game went straight to Tanga bargain bins not more than a year after publication. What a shame.

RATING: 5
So many individual components of this game are great and look gorgeous to boot, I just can't understand how the main mechanism can come down to repeated blind card-draws, and the ultimate goal comes down to having a randomly drawn/gained special ability card, otherwise is unobtainable. You can't build an almost elegant structure and then rest it effectively on a die-roll with poor odds to boot. Taking away the agency of the decision-space like that makes for a terrible experience made all the more bitter by the high production-quality. There are no strats in this game, only hope and luck.

The best game i played at Essen 2014. Unfortunately i didnt play good games at Essen 2014 so the previous sentence isnt very informative. Anyways, Madame Ching seems complex at first but a turn or two are enough to understand what you want to do. The game flows well, with a good rhytm, and there are several medium-hard decisions to take (do i go for Hong Kong or for the Ship? do i take an ability card with a short expedition or do i try to screw my opponents' plans?).
Nice components and very very nice art, expecially in the many navigation cards, all different and very chinese-feeling. It was a real pleasure to play it even if it is not a very deep game. I'll try to buy it as soon as the price goes down and i will accept very willingly to play it

The art for this game is lovely, and the wooden ships are large and solid, making them fun to manipulate. Gameplay is more abstract than I had expected, but it is very smooth, with relatively simple rules. The main flaw is that it has so many attack cards; due to that, I probably won't get to play it often.

5.5 after 1 play

A repetitive and somewhat luck driven game. Options are limited throughout the game. The process of bidding and picking cards felt repetitive after a couple of rounds, suggesting that the game lacks a stronger story arc. There are also take-that elements in the encounter cards, which further decreases the enjoyment.

Artwork is fabulous and game components quality is top-notch though.

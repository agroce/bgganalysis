Well-designed, cooperative, exploration, pick-up-and-deliver game.  Seems quite derivative of [b]Flash Point[/b], but more complicated.  The theme is terrific.  The turns are slow-ish and the game is kinda long.  These are things I don't like in cooperatives, so this game isn't my cup-of-tea.

This is a nice pirate themed cooperative game, where you have to explore a burning ship and collect as much treasure as possible (not really much if you try the easy game mode). During your turn you have to explore the ship, get through the flaming rooms, their level defined by the pips of the die in each one, fight skeleton soldiers which can really clog up your way and evidently you have to explore treasure when you either find gold or evil personas to fight. At the end of every players turn, based on cards drawn the flames go up (the pips go up) and eventually if you are unable the fight it the ship will blow up, and all your adventure comes to an abrupt end. It is a nice game with good rules, although not the best, but overall it is hard to master especially on higher levels. What it does lack, is nice artwork.

Another Pandemic clone that didn't quite outdo Pandemic. Still, it's a great alternative with an exciting theme and there are always more disasters than you can cope with in any one turn. Very challenging and beautifully presented.

The game feels fast-paced and fun. Though it seems to offer little in terms of replay value as every game feels roughly the same unless you have a completely new group. Something to experience once per group you have and then move on. That said, very interesting game.

RATING: 5
It's not exactly a bad game, but it's also not really doing anything new or novel. I like that there is some sense of exploration, but the things you find are all pretty samey.

It's pretty much a standard, abstract euro co-op in less than an hour. If you really like that sort of thing, have fun. It's got a pirate theme (yay), but it also has a couple of strangely designed rules as well slightly awkward bookkeeping like most kickstarter games (boo).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I liked this game a lot, but there are a lot of rules. Even after a fifth play we found that we'd often forget one rule, and someone would bring it up and we'd have to go back to fix something. In a lot of ways it's similar to other tile based co-ops like Forbidden Desert, but the additional rules don't make it more strategically deep, just more cumbersome.

Edit: Keep in mind  that my fellow players are not as much gamers. So while I stand by the idea that the extra rules don't add much, they also wouldn't be that cumbersome for players more familiar with the genre.

RATING: 5
Another KS purchase that comes with a dose of regret. The theme sounded so cool. But the components are not that great. It seems they may have gone into production too soon and had to go with sub-standard components. The rule book is a bit of a mess so it took us several games to get the actually gameplay right. 1st we thought it was too easy as we won our first game with hardly any problem. Then we realized we were playing movement and the fires wrong. Then it suddenly exploded (literally in game play mechanisms) into what seemed a nigh impossible exercise in futility. Then we found out that we were using the action point system wrong. You can see where this is going. The rule book is not laid out in a simple way so that you can understand how it plays through. Each time we thought we were getting it right we would find this rule tucked away somewhere and we'd have to start over again. In one play through we had to restart the game twice before we seemed to get it right. Still not sure we did. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great, easy teaching co-op game, but hard! With multiple ways to lose and only one way to win, you'll feel like things are handled and everything will blow up in your face the next turn. Literally. Still a lot of fun. Recommended for people who want a co-op game that marries mechanics and theme effortlessly.

This is a fun, thematic game but I find it difficult to win. It is hard to coordinate getting the final Treasures and then all your pirates off the ship without untended rooms exploding or filling with deckhands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Tight, tense and exciting co-op, you're attempting to loot a burning pirate ship of its treasures while contending with its undead crew. The fire dice mechanics and swarms of deckhands and Skeleton Crew enemies make for a lot of trouble, and there is only one win condition versus the numerous loss conditions. I like the shared Item pool and the fact you can pass on unused Action tokens to the next player, it really feels co-operative rather than some games where you're only racing towards the same goal and can maybe trade items when in the same spot. A welcome edition to the niche, might not see as much play for me as a Ghost Stories, Castle Panic, Pandemic or Eldritch Horror, but it will see some.

I purchased the PnP version and had a great time building the components and the box. There were a few discrepancies between the PnP and the retail (3 missing tiles and the Dead Captain), but that was easily fixed.
I didn't like the fatigue counter, with the dial, so when assembling the 5 boards, I inserted a flat, hidden, round magnet. The arms, I made with a thin flat, metal square counter that was hidden as well. This packs up neatly.

As to the game, I have played once, a solo match with 2 characters, and I nearly one, except being overrun by the dead crew, only 4 moves from victory. 
I can't wait to show this to my monthly board gaming night gamers.

I was excited about this game the minute I heard about it. My wife and I love the history of pirates, so this was just up our alley. And it did not disappoint. THe gameplay is extremely entertaining, and the theme and characters really jump out at you. It was a great experience and this game now replaces Pandemic for us.

RATING: 7
A good co-op game with a fun mechanical mix. Many of the mechanics feel like an improved version of Pandemic's Epidemic. The tile placement in the game requires some thought so you don't trap yourself or set up rooms to chain explosions. I also like that the game has a natural escalation of concerns through the Skelit's Revenge deck. Eventually you will find most of the dice, which were previously on various sides, have aligned and are all rolling up to 3, 4, 5 at the same time. This forces you to split your focus across the entire ship and does a great job of raising the tension.

RATING: 7
Ugh, this is a game I hate to love. It has a quaint idea of cooperation but the shear beating it throws at players is insulting. Maybe our group is just god-awful at playing the system but we go into Dead Men Tell No Tells expecting to lose. Combat is a dice roll, movement is hyper limited as fatigue cripples you, and everything else just amounts to you losing one way or another. Over run by deckhands? Lose. Too many explosions? Lose. Treasures blow up? Lose. Small chance you only have one exit because of the random tiles drawn but that one path that gets you back to the entrance/exit is blown up? LOSE! 

But it's damn good fun. The actions are simple. Items are simple. The goal is simple. I really hate to love this game but I end up playing whenever suggested.

Ever wish that "flashpoint: fire rescue" was set on a pirate ship? with treasure?? and zombies????? Maybe strange, but this makes for a very entertaining coop with good suspense and tough decisions that leave you pondering your mistakes when you lose. While I like flashpoint alright, this one replaced it in my collection, and for those that like flashpoint, I bring this one up.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A little clunky, and this was a little concerning since this really doesn't do anything different than pandemic and flash point.  I thought it was neat how you had "items' which felt like the roles, but they could be changed throughout the game by just using an action.  It made the choices regarding that aspect a little more interesting, but the game just felt very average at best.  I wouldn't mind trying again, but I was really hoping for more from this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice enough game but sadly not as much fun as hoped. In terms of balance, 2 player games tend to be fairly easy whereas 3+ adds more of a challenge. I'm going to spruce it up with some pirate miniatures to try and inject some life into this game.

Update: I enjoyed the game a fair bit more during my last 4 player session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
TRADE: Punched but only played .5 times. Has KS promo exclusive.

This is a well done game, however there are two primary drawbacks that cause me to drop the score down a bit.

First, this is a Pandemic play style game with some dice rolling. You're running around the board, gathering treasure rather than getting rid of diseases. There are cards that impact the board/game. However you do need to 'fight' non-player foes. In a nut shell, this feels like a more complex Pandemic with a Pirate theme laid over it. That might be good if you own lots and lots of similarly themed and mechanic style games, but I keep my collection down and this game didn't add enough versatility to my collection to keep.

Second, and this was a group consensus, it didn't fulfill that 'pirate' feel. You aren't sailing around a board, attacking other ships or that kind of thing.  You're boarding and looting a burning ship inhabited by undead.

So, if you like cooperative games, undead, and pirates, you may very well like this, but it just didn't float our boat more than other similar games.

RATING: 9
I've played this three times so far, twice with a group of four, and once with only two of us, both playing two pirates. Have only won once.

The game is very difficult so far, but in a good way; it requires a lot of coordination and cooperation between all of the players, making sure that everyone is maximizing their turn and doing as much as they can to 'beat' the ship back. For that reason, the only time I've won is the game with two players (each playing two pirates), as we worked together through each turn. With four players, everyone was too much in it for themselves and the ship quickly overwhelmed us (we don't play a lot of co-op games in my household haha).

Similar to Shadows of Camelot, each player's turn consists of several stages, the last of which is basically giving the 'board' a turn to do something awful and make your situation worse. Each player first flips over a tile and adds it to the ship, then draws a marker out of a bag and places it on that tile (representing pirates in most cases that you have to kill). Also on each tile, a die is placed on it representing the fire level in the room. At the end of everyone's turn, they flip over a card which, on top of other things, has the potential to raise the fire level in any number of rooms in the ship. If a die any any room hits 6, that room explodes and is no longer usable, and the fire can also spread out and raise the level of other adjacent rooms.

Players can spend their actions each turn fighting pirates, lowering the fire levels, or looting treasure and fleeing the ship. I've noticed that for the first 2/3 of the game, it's easy to feel like you have a handle on things and the game seems relatively easy. It's really during the last 1/3 that things start to get hairy, as fire levels continue to rise without pause and you've soon got a couple of blazing infernos going that noone can get to, on top of the pirates the game continuously adds to the board. In the only game I've won so far, the game was nearly lost at the end when rooms started exploding before we had evacuated all of the pirates (the tense situations are part of why I love this game!). The game has some strict victory conditions which can make it very hard to beat, even on easier settings.

My only real complaint at this point are some vagueness in the rule book around some situations that aren't explained and aren't necessarily easy to intuit, in terms of what the developer intended.

RATING: 9
This game is a very stressful but fun game! If you like cooperative games, this hard to find gem is well worth the time and money spent. I tell everyone the game is like a combination of Betrayal at the House on the Hill (for the tile laying and unknown effects elements) meets Flash Point Fire Rescue (for the simmering death around every corner element and the shared actions ability). Though so far, I've only played with two players, it is beatable with two (without modifying the rules), The biggest key is patience. You cannot move to fast or two slow in order to win!

Make sure you pay attention to the special skill of your character as well as all the items. These can be a great help in your quest.

Overall Ratings:

Instructions: 9/10 I did have to review these early on for how things work, but once you get everything in your mind, it is all pretty clear.

Ease of Play: 7/10 There is a lot to remember in this game, from Powder Keg explosions to the spreading of deckhands. It may take a bit to get the hang of it, but it is well worth the "practice plays".

Components: 8/10 All components are pretty high quality except the string on the felt bag. This consistently comes untied (in the first two plays it came untied three times). I'm not sure why they didn't just make it one string! Also, if you set up the game the way the instructions show, there are some missing doors. There are two solutions. You can either make a house rule regarding doors or change the order of the starting tiles.

Replay Value: 10/10 This game should never be the same game twice!

Easy to play, easy to set up and offers several ways to solve problems and several difficulties that can effect you.

This was the very first Kickstarter I ever backed, back when I first discovered modern boardgames.

The game is in fantastic condition, everything is opened, punched out, and sorted, but I have never actually played the game at all. I did use the skulls for Arcadia Quest for a while, ha!

really great game, have a lot of fun play it. There is only one problem, my friends and I are very experienced board game players and we cant win this game. I have played it many times myself and after playing by the rules for a while and not winning, we started to bend the rules to give us a better chance and still have not won. we even played it on the easiest setting there is and still we died. So very fun but prepare for a lot of explosions.

RATING: 5
We're aboard a burning pirate ship, yo ho ho! 

Fantastic concept, though once you play you realise it's basically Flash Point + Pandemic + a large dose of randomness, due to the addition of a fire die in every room.  It's possible to put yourself in a near-unwinnable state at the start if you roll badly, and even if you don't, the game repeatedly comes down to dice.

That makes the game more unpredictable than FP and P, which some people will like.  But for me, it's not a good kind of unpredictability.  I like my unpredictability predictable, damn it.

The rulebook is underwritten, and the game has quirks that really should've been picked up in playtesting.  (For example, you cannot turn over the starting tiles to mark them as burnt.)  I'm tired of these attractive but half-baked games.

A longer lasting co-operative game for 2-5 players. The game uses the common Action Point system to determine what a player does on their turn...with a twist. As players work together, they can pass their Actions on to their teammates in order to best utilize the assets that they have. Players will build the board as they play, ensuring that no two games will ever be alike. As they search the ship for the Treasure, they will encounter Enemies and Guards that they must battle, along with various items that will help them in their quest. all the while, battling the inferno that resulted when they took over the ship. Unique systems for tracking fire, enemy movement, and a player’s fatigue all combine into an interesting and unique cooperative gaming experience.

One of the largest print and play games I've made, but very much worth it! The game is a [large] step above Forbidden Island for us and we love the theme and excitement it generates. You get a great sense of exploration and discovery as you try to uncover the required number of treasures before the ship becomes a towering inferno around you, or you are overrun by scrabbling skeleton crew/deckhands. At the beginning we each controlled 1 pirate. 2 pirates to cover the entire ship is just not enough. We were overwhelmed by fire or explosions mostly. We haven't won yet, but we have actually finally used all our tiles while controlling 2 pirates each so we will do that in the future. The only thing that keeps this from being played more often is the LONG play time. It usually takes the two of us just over a couple hours a game which is not always possible especially when we both work shifts. Infrequent play time also means frequent rule reference which interrupts the game as well. Other than this, it would be a 10.

Co-op game along the same lines as Flash Point or Pandemic but with Pirates & on a burning boat. Very thematic & has beautiful pieces (looooooove those dice!). Easy enough to teach & play but can be quite difficult to win - have played it twice & only won once by the skin of our teeth. Those pesky deckhands multiply faster than rabbits in mating season! It's an enjoyable enough game but I do feel like it's missing *something*....couldn't actually put my finger on what it was though. Enjoyable nonetheless.

Not quite sure what to make of this one. Its different to anything in my collection but it doesn't really feel like a co-op as you just mill round the board doing your own thing searching rooms hoping a treasure will turn up and you can actually beat the guard. I hope to get a few more play in of this one before I make up my mind.

Actually this is quite a complex game with lots of moving parts that you need to keep an eye on. Its actually quite difficult. :)

This is just a great, thematic co-op.  After two plays haven't got anywhere near beating the easy setting yet. If I only had 1 game on a desert island I'd currently be happy if it was this.  Don't see me exhausting its play value any time soon.Great that in the second printing they have made the starting boards individual so that you can turn them over when they explode just like the others.  Who doesn't want to place pirate skulls all over a board????  Feel like I'm in a Pirates of the Caribbean scenario, swashbuckling around skeleton crew and trying to escape with the loot before the whole ship explodes.

RATING: 7
Need to play it a bit more.  Fiddly rules and quite a bit of luck as to where the treasure pops up.  Still a game that does so many things right (using the gold coins to keep track of actions and passing actions off is AMAZING.  Many other co-ops can learn from this game.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this more than Flash Point or Pandemic.  Fun theme, shiny dice, and a disaster progression system with some unexpectedness without being completely random.  Lots of ways to up the difficulty as you learn the game.  I recommend pulling two tiles per character for a couple of turns instead of just one to kick start the game.

Update: this is still fun and I'm happy to play, but I debated letting it go.  Gotta ratchet up the difficulty next time I play I guess.  The SO finds the upkeep a bit much but that doesn't bother me.

Ultimately I kept it because it's a fun intro for new people to (coop) gaming (and, you know, because it has nice dice and pirates and is beautiful).

Light game, but not Zombie Dice light.  The rules are fairly clear, and the gameplay is simple enough to teach in about two or three rounds.  The fact that this is a small-ish game with a 5 player upper limit, and a 2 player lower limit, makes it nice for small gatherings, but not larger ones.
I have to love how it's such a simple game rules-wise, but the strategy can be reasonably complex.  If you don't keep the enemy count down, and loot enough rooms before you run out of tiles, things go south quickly, but then, same goes for the fire levels.  And the chain reactions can sink the ship in one fell swoop if you haven't been keeping the fire down.

Basic, action point allowance co-op. The game takes longer to setup than it does to play (because the game usually kills you).

The theme is cool, and if you really enjoy the standard co-op formula (think Matt Leacock games), then you will enjoy this one. Other than that, it is nothing special.  The box is beautiful at least.

Unfortunately not very thematic. I felt more like a firefighter than a pirate. And turning dice isn't very entertaining. And nothing entertaining is happening during the entire game. A game that you easily can play by your own.

I've played this game a number of times now by myself controlling two characters.  I've enjoyed my playthroughs even though I've lost as much (or more) than I've won.  

The game starts off nice and calm and you feel like you are in control.  You can keep the fire down, the number of deckhands manageable, etc.  Once you pick up that first treasure, though, things start to slip.  While you are slowly dragging the chest back to the exit, the fires start picking up and deckhands start spreading out.  I've lost because the ship exploded and I've also lost because deckhands have overrun the ship.  The only times I've won, I was a turn or two away from losing (and that was on the Easy difficulty).  

The components are pretty good, although you have to be careful punching out the spinners; at least two of mine started to separate.  

The rule book is pretty decent, but there are a few things that really need clarification. Does it take a movement point to jump onto the ship? (Yes)  Do the guards move? (No)  Which skeletons are the guards? And so on....  It was easy enough to jump online and find answers.  Kane Klenko, the designer, is pretty active on the board and will answer your questions relatively quickly.

Looking forward to getting more plays.

A 6 calls it an ok game, a 7 means you are basically up to play it whenever. I think it is a great game, fun theme, challenging and unique with many ways to both lose and increase the difficulty, giving it high replay value which is cool. But since it is a co-op and difficult, I am not sure I would be down to play it every time someone brought it up. So while I would give it a 7 out of pure game play I had to send it down to a 6.5. But a fun game and I definitely do not regret the purchase.

i really enjoyed it! Lots of layers of strategy. Only flaw I'm feeling right now is that thematically, the shape or the tiles doesn't really reflect the feeling of being on a ship.

Stuck between a rock and a hard place your two options are explore the burning ship filled with ghost pirates or invoke the wrath of your ships captain and be thrown overboard, you choose the sane option and decide to explore a burning ghost ship for treasure.

The fire mechanic is interesting and becomes an almost flashpoint/pandemic style panic when barrels get close to exploding and you have to move to even hotter fires to progress and take damage as you do so.

Since it is a co-op the game is very difficult. A lot of times you're able to get the treasures back but getting to the dingy to escape becomes impossible due to explosions blocking off routes. Still fun though and the pirate theme comes across pretty well.

2017-07-03 - I did actually get this back to the table a while back. We played 2 games back to back and it was alright. Coops aren't ever going to make it to the table very often here, though, and this one is a bit more complicated than I'd like it to be. Lowering my rating to a 6.

2016-05-14 - I'm dropping this half a point to a 7, just because, while I remember the game fondly, it hasn't really been able to make it back to the table since that first play.

2015-05-20 - First impression: This feels a bit like a cross between Flash Point and Pandemic (the mechanisms are different, but they feel like just a different way to implement the same thing, if that makes sense). It adds combat and a cool tile-laying exploration aspect, though, and I really like the theme and art.

Though it doesn't add much that is novel mechanically to the co-op genre, Dead Men Tell No Tales implements its theme so well that it deserves special recognition.

A coop game where players are looting a burning ship, only to find skeletons on board.

The negatives first: the rules are horribly fiddly. The game could've been streamlined and made so much easier to learn without all the various exception rules.

That being said, once we started playing (albeit with some mistakes in the first few games), everyone really enjoyed it. There are quite a few things to manage on a burning ship and the game escalates very quickly. 

Would also have liked some better components for the game especially to differentiate guards and skeletons.

RATING: 6
Super hard if you play it right. Even on easy settings it feels like the tile lay out and the revenge cards will ultimately be the deciding factor (instead of skill) which makes this game luck based, yet you kill yourself trying to strategize.

I suggest playing with 3 people at first because if you play with five, by the time everybody does one turn and is barely on the ship there's ten tiles all with things on them.. Which, are placed randomly by a draw bag (adding more luck to the game). There's a chance you'll get a lot of hatches (more deckhands to eat up your actions) and treasure guards. Without cutlasses you'll have a hard time winning combat (decided by die and invested action tokens). If you rush you can waste actions/over look things. Take too long there'll be too many explosions ava game over.

You aren't really free to do what you like, the game always demands you to do the best choice (which more often than not, isn't enough).

Mix that with a confusing rulebook that will probably have you play 2-3 games wrong (until you realize) and you're probably going to get stressed out.

The pieces are great, everything is made awesome, art is good, the pirate meeples, unique abilities, it's just too much against the players.

I think a summary of the rules in bullet point form would help a lot. Especially if divided up into the phases. Like bold print "deckhands don't move onto adjacent tiles with hatches on them." Instead of looking through paragraphs for answers. Also I didn't know you can remove deck hands in adjacent rooms from you etc.

I need more time with this one. I feel like instead of it being naturally difficult, that it was designed unrealistically difficult (which not to be insulting but making an impossible game can be done by anyone.) It isn't difficult because of legitimate strategy requiring planning, skills, tactics etc. Although it does, it's difficult because it just SO happens that a treasure landed on a tile that had a high fire die which is four rooms away but thanks to fatigue you'll never make it in time, even if you could you have only a chance at winning by rolling a high number (which you might still lose and now you're in an exploding room) even if youhave the ability to choose which revenge card is next, it ends up being a "well guys next turn we will lose regardless what we do".

Yeah.

I'm really impressed with this game. With all of these Pandemic clones, it's hard, without playing them, to sort the good games from the bad. Dead Men Tell No Tales is definitely one of the former. It's streamlined, simple and (somewhat) thematic. You can also knock out a 2 player game in less than an hour. A winner, for sure.

This Game is Excellent!! All of the puzzle like elements of Pandemics threat management system with an immersive them.

I find the personal fatigue dial to be just excellent in making your character really feel like you, but the ability to share items and pass action tokens does balances this perfectly for working together. I prefer this to the dry feeling of Pandemic. 

Pros. Emersive theme, modula board, Excellent Solo, Components

Cons. (Minor things)
KS so missed a few things like exploded rooms for the start tile, explosion marker is indistinguishable from the explosion track,]NO victory track

SO MUCH FUN! This is literally THE ONLY co-operative game about which Peter and I are in agreement. We both find it super fun! It is also one of only 3 (Legends of Andor + Mage Knight) co-operative games we enjoy.

I really, really want to love this game.  It is pretty random.  The artwork and components are great, and the theme is fun (who doesn't like pirates?), but somehow it seems like it would have a lot of downtime at higher player counts compared to other games we have found.

RATING: 5
Despite being somewhat mechanically different, it's just another Pendemic-style game. There's a couple different loss situations and the players cooperate to identify which is the most important and prevent them. Seems alright, but...I've already got Pandemic, and Matt Leacock is better at coming up with elegant systems. I don't see myself playing this much.

Great theme, nice puzzley co-op that is quite challenging so far, even on easy.  Very pandemic-like, if that's up your alley. Rules have MANY small nit-pick issues that aren't clarified in the rulebook; fortunately, the designer is very active on BGG and the bgg forums answer pretty much any question you have (with a little searching).  Fun, but since I'm not a huge co-op fan, just not something I'm jumping to play. Excellent art, though, and I could see this one attracting some non-gamers who are curious about the theme.

Due to many similar mechanics, this game can't escape comparison to Flash Point.
And is far superior FlashPoint-"variant". More things to think about, more degrees of fire, far more player-oriented... and the theme is far more awesome. Pirates, yeah!
Also, the little skull-tokens are one of the most awesome tokens I've ever seen in a game.

This is my favourite of the Pandemic style games. It's less predictable (so you can't math it out as easily as Pandemic) and the theme is far more interesting. It's easier with fewer players (as you can spread towards the newly explored tiles faster) so playing solo isn't as challenging without playing extra characters.

No cats nor dogs popping just pass you here but tile placement, exploration, dice rolling and looting trying to prevent explosions, overruns, fatigue and spreading skeletons. DMTNT is a bag of escalating loosing conditions slowly but surely putting you in unwinnable situations. Because difficulty is decided by random dice, random tiles, random tokens and random cards all having immediate effects with no clues of whatever's coming, there is more to do here but less to solve than more streamlined and clever coop games like Pandemic or Freedom.

規則:
*四個起始版塊跟爆炸軌組裝如圖，爆炸標記放在該軌左邊，每個房間擲一顆對應顏色骰放中間(6重骰)，有陷阱標記的放一個骷顱，事件卡洗勻成牌庫，房間版塊洗勻，將人數*2數量的最上方轉45度，20個兩面圓片放袋中，選擇遊戲難度2-3/4-5人三級難度分別為4/5-5/6-6/6+打敗所有骷顱團員，數字代表找到的寶藏數
*每人拿一個個人版轉到0，一個隨機腳色卡跟物品卡，戰鬥標記放個人圖板0的位置，拿5個行動標記，剩下物品卡開著放桌上，你的腳色米寶放在爆炸軌的小船上，玩家腳色名字字母最前面的起始
*遊戲輪流進行直到達成成功或失敗條件，每個玩家回合有三個階段
1.打開一張板塊並加到圖板上，每人第一次是開兩個(轉45度的板塊提醒)，門跟門相連即可，然後從袋中抽一個圓片放上面，有數字面朝上，如果是陷阱圓片則放1骷顱，如果沒地方放則遊戲結束直接失敗
*板塊上中間如果有骰點放對應骰子跟點數在上面，沒數字的不放，版塊不能放在爆炸軌的切線下方
*最後一個板塊放下時如果有一個門沒接東西，則放出口板塊在這，找到另外一個出口，兩個出口可自由進出
2.做行動 先翻正5個行動標記，然後可翻面1行動標記來做1行動如下，也可跳過把行動標記留給下家(最多傳一家)
>移動到相鄰板塊，如果目標的骰點大於離開房間，則獲得差值的疲憊值，出口算0
>移動兩格，額外獲得兩點疲憊，並正常結算通過的兩個房間疲憊值
>滅火 降所在房間骰一點，降到0時移除
>移除骷顱 移除一個所在或相鄰有門的房間的骷顱
>拾取標記 拿取該標記放到個人圖板上，寶藏上限一個，放置物品在該房間板塊不耗行動
>降低兩點疲憊值
>提剩一格戰鬥值
>放自己物品卡到牌區拿另外一張到自己面前，如果是拿別人的，該玩家再從卡牌區拿一個
*如果米寶跟骷顱圓片同格則戰鬥不花行動(要先棄掉寶藏在該格，多人時選擇一個人戰鬥即可)，計算要使用的圖板戰鬥值然後丟骰跟物品修正值，數值大於等於時該圓片翻面放置，小於時獲得差值的疲憊值然後值戰鬥骰結算結果(1-2骷髏撤退到相鄰房，3-4你撤退到相鄰房，要結算疲憊值，5在戰鬥一次，6自己選)
*看守寶藏的不移動，戰鬥失敗拿完疲憊值後決定繼續打或是撤退，要先打完骷顱才能打守衛
*戰鬥值使用後就歸0，小刀圓片會佔據你戰鬥軌最左格，提升你的基礎戰鬥力
*拿著寶藏時，只能選走一格/休息/交換物品卡且進入房間時拿該骰點的疲憊值，寶藏只要一拿到出口自動放在結算卡
3.抽一張事件卡結算，結算是從左下往右一列一列結算，如果結算完第三張有5的卡則將事件卡棄牌洗回去
>顏色骰 所有該色骰加一點，無骰點的骰則所有無骰對應顏色區放一顆一點的
*房間門口有數字的，如果骰點加到該數字，則該門口相鄰的區域骰值加1，如果沒有房間則順時鐘往另外的門找，爆炸後把該骰蓋掉該數字來標記結算過，每輪只會爆炸一次
*房間如果骰值到6則往所有門口爆炸一次(沒相鄰房間就沒差)，之後該版塊翻面不能再進入，所有標記移除，如果有人在裡面則死亡
*只要發生爆炸則爆炸軌右移一格，移到骷顱時遊戲失敗
>單純陷阱，則所有陷阱房放一個骷髏，陷阱加箭頭，則陷阱房有骷顱的往門口相鄰的板塊放一個，放置時不會放到陷阱房或是骷顱比自己多的房間，沒骷髏加時遊戲失敗
*兩個骷髏在房間時不能拿任何物品，3個以上時就不能進入，如果你在此房間你的行動只有離開或是清骷顱的選擇
>移動船員圓片 移動到相鄰房間，往玩家米寶靠近，同樣條件時玩家選擇
*船員的房間如果骰值增加，增加一點疲憊值，疲憊轉盤記錄你可以進入的骰點房間，如果所在房間超過限制，則下個行動只能選滅火休息或是離開，疲憊值到底也死亡
*移到出口時必須馬上結束回合，疲憊值降一半(向上取整)，剩下行動圓片傳給下家
*喝酒可以恢復上面數字的疲憊值
*死亡時，移除所有原始配備(物品卡移出遊戲)，抽一張新的腳色進場，隨機選一張物品卡，如果有待寶藏放在死亡房間，回合馬上結束，但是也要抽事件卡，每腳色可以進場時一樣遊戲失敗
*遊戲在達到目標後，所有玩家走到出口後結束，對應數目寶藏在場時，有玩家死掉也輸，如果移除的寶藏數使得目標沒辦法達成也輸
***困難變體***
*減少骷髏總數
*起始多轉一些房間，讓房間出現數變快
*爆炸軌設高一點
*有玩家死亡就輸
***船長變體***
*起始設置時把對應的船長圓片丟袋中，抽到時隨機選一面放圖板上然後在正常抽一個，船長會跟骷髏船員一樣移動，如果他被打敗丟回袋中，遊戲要宣告勝利時船長不能在場

Reminds me of flash point, just a different theme. A few weird rules like swapping items when not in the same room are existing. Quite difficult to win, but not too interesting in terms of game play and coop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A blend of traditional co-op elements. Turn over a tile and expand the board. Spend action points to walk, reduce fire, clear the board of baddies, collect treasure, and manage fatigue. The aim is to clear treasure off the board, just like you clear out victims in Flashpoint. If you don't reduce fire, you run the risk of too many rooms exploding (outbreaks in Pandemic). These are comfortable yet derivative tropes. But where's the co-op? Each person goes off to get a treasure and bring it back. Take advantage of your special power as much as you can, but there's not enough differentiation or oomph to override the basic objective of bringing treasure back asap. The only risk assessment is whether to reduce fire or not, and that's done by counting down the deck. And you'll either get lucky or not. The main problem was that it didn't feel clever, nor tense, nor riven by difficult decision making. Move out. Manage fire. Collect stuff. Come back. And therefore not exciting enough to add to the co-op rotation.

Backed on Kickstarter. 

Great game! I love the theme, artwork is awesome and the components are excellent. We had a blast even during our first play through. The rulebook lays everything out in a very streamlined fashion that is clear and easy to understand. We had very little questions during our first game and only had to check the book for a couple rule clarifications (Which were easy to find thanks to the nice layout of the rulebook). Certain games can take a few plays to really get the grasp of them and that can be a turnoff for some but you don't have to worry about that with this game. It's easy to teach so you can jump right into the fun but at the same time it does require strategy and that you work together with your crew in order to win because it isn't easy! We got overrun by deck hands our first game. 

There is not a lot of downtime between turns either which is nice. You're not sitting there, bored waiting for your next turn. Since it's co-op, even when it's not your turn you can still work together to try and win which you will want to do because even the easiest of modes provides a nice challenge. 

I am hoping to see future expansions. If so, count me in!

Boring. I'm not a cooperative huge fan - especially those games that can be played solo and would be exactly the same - but, for me, Dead Men Tell No Tales is even worst than the average coop. Nothing really new here, the theme is awfuly explored and the end game could bring a vicius circle of nonsense boredom. Like zombies, pirates are easily sold, and unfortunately just a few games/movies/books succeed in giving those themes the proper feeling.

That's said, the art is great. =p

Okay - important caveats: (1) I love Pirate games (Pirate vs Pirate, Pirates Cove, Sword and Skull, Jamaica...). (2)I am a big fan of co-op and all the mechanics that go with it. (3) Thematic tense games rock! (Ghost Stories, Pandemic...). Put it together and what do you get (bibbidy bobbody boo? Nope)... THIS GAME. It just hits all the nails on the head for me.  Absolutely love it!!!! Why is fatigue so cool... it really is just hit points reinvented but oh so much more. You have seemedly wasted actions on a turn? no... if you do.. hand over some actions to the next player. Equipment management huge... And as for the co-operating pirates criticism...who cares...even Jack Sparrow worked with Barbossa for a while (albeit not on best of terms). Rulebook could be a little better written but in most cases logic is there anyway. Awesome!

Pros:
- Variable setup
- Suspenseful, theme is well implemented
- Nice artwork
- Good amount of strategy and a need to work with your crew
- Quality components
- Challenging
- Engaging - the first time we lose we often play again immediately after in an attempt to implement a better strategy.

Cons:
- First print run box insert does not fit components after you punch them out of the sheets.  You will have to modify it slightly or throw it out to get everything back in the box.
- If you have the first printing of the game, you have to find a way to cover the starting board sections if one of the squares on it 'blows up' since nothing came with the game to do that and the board is all one piece.  They now offer an updated starting board (with the tiles that can be flipped) for cheap on their web store and the second printing will come with that already in place.

Thoughts:
While we were learning we had some points of confusion that we had to work out.  I'm not sure if this was because of the rulebook structure or us mixing up the rules with something else.  Once we figured out our mistake everything got much better.

:d6-1: we just barely picked up Flash point, so we are probably good for awhile, unless you get a killer deal on it. We got to try this a bit recently, and liked it as far as we tried it. We have played Flash point once before, and liked it.

I suspect expansions will add a variety of really neat things, but for solo, quicker, or more narrative, is probably best.

I thought I was over cooperative games after buying/selling Bauza's Ghost Stories. However, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a great experience. The theme is awesome. The way you progress through the ship, revealing new tiles, the way dice are used to reflect fire levels in each cabin of the ship, etc. All of it works! I usually hate dice combat but it's mitigated with the ability to "beef up" your defense via spending action coins to increase strength. I also like that you can share unused action coins between players. I've considered trading this game before but something about it just keeps me turning away trade offers. I think I'll keep it awhile longer!

Loot from my Pirate Santa from this years BGG Secret Santa! A really good fun co-op! We have played two games and managed to win both on the easiest level, though it was incredibly close both times - I am definitely looking forward to/fearing cranking up the difficulty! This is a great game, with potential to be one of my new favourites!

RATING: 7.5
Very fun co-op, in the style of the "Forbidden" games. The games looks beautiful, is incredibly thematic, plays fast, is tense, and most importantly, is a lot of fun. There is a lot of luck involved, but most of it can be mitigated somewhat. Currently have a 50% win rate.

Negatives: Some characters do not seem well-balanced. The box insert was useless, so I currently just have everything floating around in there. Would benefit from a foam insert/custom tray if I find the time.

Looking forward to a possible expansion.

Pros
- Fun co-op with some interesting new ideas
- Some fun and good quality components

Cons
- Feels very same-y after just a few plays with very little replayability

The game is fun at first, but once you beat it a few times, there's really no reason to come back to it. With no real variations, the variable pirate powers aren't enough to keep this from feeling like the exact same game every time it's played.

RATING: 7.2
You can never be cross at a game that gives you tiny wooden pirate skulls.

Lots for me to like here: tile-laying, short crawls, avoidable baddies, FIRE DICE!, and cooperative play against baddies that are eventually not avoidable.

Our first game (two player) was a bit easy, even though we forgot to take the scary captain out. (He went out after we realised our mistake.) I'm looking forward to seeing if that's a fluke.

In some ways, though, what I like about it (sort of a dungeon crawl but on a pirate ship and you run in and out - sorry, I don't know the fancy term for this) may be what eventually keeps me away (too confined?). Time will tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
I'm finding this co-op to be quite a tricky beast, in a good way. You have to monitor fire levels, potential explosion chain reactions (similar to pandemic outbreaks) an undead army of skeletons (that seem harmless but they can soon bog you down if left alone) Your characters fatigue levels and leveling up your attack strength all whilst attempting to loot a ship. Seemed a bit fiddly at first but after a couple of games under your scabbard it runs fine. Quite the challenging puzzle.

I enjoyed my play of this, but I'm not sure how I feel about a lot of the mechanics of the game.  The characters strike me as ridiculously imbalanced for fun or gameplay.  The actions of most turns are not terribly interesting, and the luck swings in the game are pretty outrageous.  I really like most of the art, but it bugs me that the final product of a game does not in any way resemble a ship.  I liked Kane Klenko's other game a lot, and in fact he's been on my geekbuddy list for many years because I value his opinions, but this game just didn't do it for me.

Also have tried with four players, and plays very well.  I only have a couple of co-op games, bu tthis game is second at the top of my list next to Pandemic: Legacy.

RATING: 8
This is a well designed co-op game with a difficulty level that can be customized. 

The rule book is comprehensive and excellent, leaving little to question,  which is a big plus. Overall,  the components are riveting,  however,  the artwork on the tiles,  while befitting the theme,  is a bit on the dark side.

As far as the ideal player count,  I think this one works better on the lower end of the spectrum.  I found 2 to be the sweet spot,  with 3 as the next best option.  It works fine solo also - although I would still utilize 2 players in this instance.

Now go plunder !

RATING: 8.5
Wow.  This game is really fun.  It has a very good balance of managing fires, deckhands, fatigue, actions, and crew.  There's no denying it's tough, and strategies will need to evolve as the ship is revealed (the chance factor ensures not all strategies always work), but it's not impossible and this also makes it replayable.  Communication is key!

It's difficult to get started because there are so many situations and conditions in the game, you can't just jump in and play, but it's actually not that difficult to play.  There're just a lot of things to remember.  A couple games in and it should move fairly quickly.

I've only gotten around to play it once but I already love it. I want to play it harder as we tried it at the easiest level, but the different mechanics, randomness of the board, and everything about this game just make it really entertaining. It reminds me of Pandemic with Pirates and a touch of Betrayal at the House on the Hill (for the tile flipping). Definitely a game that will get pulled out often to play.

RATING: 3.5
[thing=141423][/thing] has some interesting mechanics - the fatigue track, the actions against the fire and how it works; but, the end result of everything put together is a game to drop dead of boredom: in the game I was in no one was having fun nor there was excitement, as even the event cards are lame: just enemies that enter/move and the chance of increasing fire. These could be exciting, but aren't.

Play lasted for around 90 minutes, but felt like 180. The ending was totally anticlimatic and not thematic - after we took all the treasures we kept fighting the skeletons, over and over and over, as we took some out, more entered - and we couldn't stop battling them because every pirate needed to flee the ship, and we couldn't have a breathing space in order to accomplish this. Thus play went on and we got more and more annoyed. Why lose if a pirate stays behind? What kind of ethic this pirates have? Isn't better to divide the treasure by one less? Even in the moral ground: it is better 5 (or 50, 100) dying than 1 or 2, keeping a ship near other ready to explode? Why in hell should we care, after taking all the treasures out, if Skelit's ship is overrun by skeletons?

The manual, in the brazilian edition, lacks an important part for the set of the game; and it also doesn't have explanations for the pirates abilities - and we struggled in understanting the timming/use of one. The art and graphic design of the components and cards is excellent, though.

In the end, even me, a person that not only likes cooperative games, but enjoy them the most; and the stronger the theme, the better it is; could give a pass to [thing=141423][/thing], which is sad, as I kept it for quite a while in my wishlist. [thing=141423][/thing] was dull beyond belief, and I will avoid it in the future.

I'm not going to rate this, because I played it only twice on TTS (before trying my physical copy, which I ended up not doing), once as a 2-player, once solo playing a 2P game. I like to play a game at least 3-4 times before rating it. But unofficially, I'd say it would rate a 7.5 - 8 from me.

I very much enjoyed DMTNT, but my play group (i.e., my wife!) felt it was too intense and unforgiving. It certainly was, but it was also loads of fun. Oh, well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Similar length and pacing to Pandemic. Doesn't have the intensification mechanic so less of a puzzle, but more of an immersive theme. Two interesting additions that do add some puzzliness are 1. Unused actions are passed to the next player. This allows 'super' turns and encourages specialisation. 2. Item swapping. Makes no sense thematically so it feels a bit broken/like cheating. If done correctly effectively adds a free action to each player each turn following. Overall a lesser game than Pandemic (unless you really like pirates and the extra storytelling opportunities DMTNT provides).

Excellent (and very difficult) cooperative game.  Love the wrapper and the mechanics, but it requires a few lucky breaks and total attention to detail to win.

Plunder the sinking, burning pirate ship with a belly full of loot. Battle fatigue, fire and skeletons searching modular ship tiles using character and item cards. Event cards for random Skelit crew encounters and advancing stages of fire. Coop, action point system to amass the treasure and get out alive before the ship explodes and sends you to Davie Jones locker. Clever mechanic to manage your combat level. The trick is to manage your fatigue. Has elements that remind me of Flash Point, Pandemic, and Forbidden Desert. I keep forgetting this is a cooperative game. It almost seems better if everyone was for themselves.

RATING: 7
How do dice become blazing rooms of fire?

In this game, the red/yellow dice are cleverly used to represent the amount of fire in a room, and throughout the game each player, as a pirate, will be able to subdue the fires as they move through the rooms and try to accumulate treasure, which they then need to to take off the ship.

The Treasures are actually flip sides of 'Guard' tokens, which you need to fight to obtain the token. You can see the 'size' of the Guard in the rooms, so you can prepare to fight by adding to your battle strength.

All players get a set number of actions each turn, and 'unused' actions can be transferred to another player to use. 

Each thing that is done in this game is spot on with the theme, like the tension that comes with the possibility of an explosion, or the feeling that you have been beaten down by a rather large guard which 'Fatigues' you, and just trying to go through rooms with as little heat as you can is all here, amazingly demonstrated with nicely illustrated tiles, and dice. 

This is a fairly light-to-medium game, that fits into a weekday evening easily. I enjoy the 'puzzle' aspect of it, as well as determining strategic locations for drawn room-tiles. I would go so far as to say the game is 'bigger' than it's components, which is a good thing especially for replayability.

A solid '7' game, since I would suggest it to nearly anyone, and it is playable in more situations than some of the meatier games I generally prefer. But going medium-light, this one is quite satisfying.

When we completed our first game, I was already thinking about playing the next one. It does take co-operation, and thoughtful actions, but it culminates into a terrific co-operative game that works.

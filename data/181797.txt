Pretty cool light engine-building game.  The card powers and the combinations you should go for will take several games to get down.  I can see a lot of floundering until this happens.  Rules are pretty smooth.  The "retro" art isn't really my thing, but I get it.

RATING: 7

1st play: After hearing the bad reviews from Sasquatch and general lukewarm reception I was expecting much worse a game.  It's VERY multi player solitaire, and the animals don't have a thematic tie to the powers they give really.  That said, the game was enjoyable and interesting enough.  I'm interested to see if there's more interplay in the 2nd play, but if not, this joins many of Breese's other games in being good, solid games, but nothing amazing.

2nd play: Well, the game was enjoyable the second time as well, but played quite a bit faster than the first time.  There still wasn't a ton of player interaction, but it's possible that once I understand the system more clearly I could start to focus on what my opponents are doing and capitalize on the openings they create.

Much more interesting than I initially thought it was going to be. Played a tight 3p game of it at bgg.con. One player was running away with the race on the board, but another was able to develop a highly specialized class of creature that had like 4 or 5 australia symbols, and moved like 9 or ten spaces (!!!) to claim a 3 point tile at the end of the game. I was middling in terms of motion as I had been multiplying simply to increase the number of creatures, without making very wise choices about the traits I was accumulating. I was able to draw into some very valuable point cards in the level 3 deck, however, and combined with the few blue tiles I had acquired I was able to squeak out a win. I feel like this needs to be made clear to new players, that the race is important but so are the point cards, and the relative distribution of them in the decks (this is made somewhat clear in the rulebook, to be fair). 
Fans of innovation will be fans of this, I think, as cards can be used in multiple ways and you will have a large, splayed tableau when you are finished. Overall a very nice design. One complaint/caveat is that the tableaus are LARGE and keeping track of everything everyone can do becomes very difficult toward the end of the game. I also wonder how samey the game will feel after a while with a static board as everyone starts with similar powers (modified somewhat by initial card draw). The decks are very large, however, so I think that will help quite a bit.

Το inhabit the earth είναι ένα card game με ιδιαίτερο θέμα, την εξέλιξη των ζώων στη Γη. Προσπερνώντας το λιτό artwork βλέπουμε διάφορα ταμπλό/ήπειροι με μια διαδρομή στο καθένα. Οι παίκτες ξεκινούν με μια κάρτα ζώο στο παιχνίδι που αντιπροσωπεύετε με ένα τόκεν στο ταμπλό. 

Παίζοντας τις κάρτες σου μπορείς να βελτιώσεις το ζώο σου, προσθέτοντας του ουσιαστικά έξτρα εικονίδια ώστε να μπορεί να προχωράει πιο γρήγορα στο ταμπλό, μπορείς να κατεβάσεις καινούργια ζώα ώστε να συναγωνίζεσαι σε πολλά ταμπλό ή ακόμα ακόμα να μεταλλάξεις κάποιο από τα ζώα σου σε ένα άλλο με διαφορετικό special ability. 
 
Οι κάρτες του παιχνιδιού χωρίζονται σε 3 εποχές με την πρώτη εποχή να έχει κυρίως ζώα με ικανότητες που βοηθούν στην εξέλιξη του παιχνιδιού, ενώ οι κάρτες τις τρίτης εποχής δίνουν τρόπους για να σκοράρεις μπόνους πόντους στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού. Προφανώς παίρνεις πόντους ανάλογα και με το πόσο προχώρησες σε κάθε ταμπλό.

Συμπαθητική προσπάθεια αλλά λίγο το αδιάφορο theme, λίγο το αδιάφορο artwork δύσκολα να σε κρατήσει σαν παίκτη. Το gameplay είναι αξιόλογο μεν αλλά όχι κάτι το πραγματικά εξαιρετικό/διαφορετικό.

I'm generally not a fan of race games, but early plays suggest this could become a favourite - a little quirky perhaps, but plenty of rewarding gameplay.  Reactions from others I've played with has been mixed, but those that like it really like it. Looking forward to playing it more and exploring the different actions on the cards.

This is a quirky, amusing card effects game with a very pleasing theme.  I like its design quirkiness and its theme, but since I am not a huge fan of card effects games, I can't quite say that I love to play this game.  Still, Inhabit the Earth is a worthy (and educational) game which undoubtedly took a lot of time to research and design.

Rating increased.  The more I play the more I am enjoying.  Lots of combos and decisions.  When to multiply or evolve to create your breeder.  When to adapt - no additional creatures but easier to create your 'racer(s)'.  When to move so as not to get left behind.  Always draw from the highest numbered deck allowed.  Deck two for the bigger scoring cards.  Deck three for the easier ones.  When to use your tokens to boost or trigger movement.  When to migrate (when there are tokens up for grabs in target continent, when you have more continent icons elsewhere, when your terrains are better matched elsewhere).  Decisions, decisions.  A definite learning curve after which AP largely goes away.  Similar in feel to RftG but with Juliet's fun deawings.

This felt a lot like a Kiesling and Kramer game. Unfortunately for me, that isn't nearly as appealing as it once was. This isn't a bad game by any means, but there just isn't anything new and interesting enough to get me excited to play it again. I'm beginning to feel a bit like a grumpy, old gamer nowadays.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Not earth shattering, but neat.  Couple of people didn't like the art, but I actually think the game looks good overall, although I wish the board was a board, vs 6 boards that look terrible lined up.  There are a ton of ways to use cards, and that is interesting, but does seem to cause a good amount of down time.  I was thinking this might be better with less players, but not sure if the conflict on the boards would be as interesting.  Definitely want to play more, but not sure if this is a long term keeper yet.

Just one play so far. 

Seemed to be lacking something. I think that optimizing a strategy due to all the combinations of migrations and adaptations in this one is pretty complicated, and would take a great deal of time to do properly - the sort of time that my limited attention span simply doesn't want to deal with. After key market this was a bit of a letdown.

I liked this more than I expected. It's basically a card-management/tableau builder with a race on top. Basically abstract, but the illustrations are nice. Like all Breese games, it has the potential for head-exploding AP problems, so if you play with people who don't know to manage their time, you have been warned. Although it seems clearly optimized for 3 or 4, it seems like it might find a potential niche as a 2 player game, where the downtime wouldn't be as brutal.

Anyway, I enjoyed it, but the potential downtime nightmare probably makes this for Breeseophiles only.

RATING: 6
While the game was alright, I was hoping to like it a lot more than I did. One of my favorite games is Bruges, where you build up a tableau of characters with different abilities to better advance your position in the game. When I saw the card play here, I thought it might be similar.

However, the abilities on the animals were fairly minor vs. the race aspect of the game where you need to build up a bunch of symbols on your animals to advance down various paths, and I just didn't feel like I had a lot of control over things, or that I could use the abilities to make much of a difference.

I was also incredibly disappointed that so many animals had the exact same special abilities as other animals. One of the exciting things about the game was the prospect of all these animals with all these special abilities; it seemed like there was room for more creativity here.

Generally, I really like games where you get a hand of multi-use cards and make the best of them, but I just didn't feel like the options were that exciting, and some times you just plain don't get things you need to set yourself up well.

Overall, I still thought it was OK and would play again, but it didn't live up to what I was hoping for.

I found this to be a fun hybrid race/special powers/engine building game on a map. If that sounds a little messy, that's because it is. But the rules are fairly simple and easy to grasp once playing, so managing the mess is part of the fun. The theme is engaging and well integrated. The endgame is a little anti-climactic, but it plays quickly and is fun. I also like how the animals are kind of deranged looking. Fun art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great multi-use card game from Richard Breese. It is definitely deeper as you try and figure out which of the 3 actions you should do on a turn. While the card powers do repeat I feel it is similar to Bruges and that is a game that I love. This is definitely a little more to grok than Bruges, but I imagine after another game or so this will click a bit better and play a little faster too. I do like the end game condition being a race, but then there is still some scoring at the end. In our first game, 1 player scored both 3 bonus point tiles and only managed to win by 1 point so getting those scoring cards in the second and third decks can be rather helpful too. All in all I'm definitely happy to play this one again and we'll see if it moves up my list of favorite multi-use card games.

I was always going to like this game. The parallels with Race for the Galaxy and Lewis and Clark left that certain. The real question was "how much", and the answer is "a lot". This has the cardplay of innovation, particularly the symbol matching, but without the obtuse language and with a tangible goal. It has the racing of Lewis and Clark, without the effective elimination problem. It has so many clever ideas running around. I can see this being a problem with players that struggle with AP, but I'm not going to allow a test case. I suspect that this will be most enjoyable at 3, which is good as I frequently play at that number.

Another racing game that sparks my interest!  That's rare.  This game, though, offers some very interesting ideas.  You can play one species, but change it to anther, add characteristics, migrate to another continent etc.  The race is first one to the end of 6 (or 4) continents, but you must travel through different terrain.  If your animal had adapted appropriately, you can travel quickly through the terrain.  If not, you might get bogged down.

Parsing the terrains of 6 continents is overwhelming on a first play, but I quite enjoyed the rest of the game.

The special powers are undoubtedly useful, but good icon manipulation seems even more important.

Ein Rennspiel auf sechs Kontinententafeln soll es sein, dieses „Inhabit the Earth“. Wir schicken bis zu sechs Kreaturen ins Rennen, die wir im Laufe der Partie vermehren. Die Marker ziehen durch Landschaften, unsere Viecher verändern sich. Aus einem Schnabeltier wird ein Nasenbeutler, warum weiß niemand. Es passt halt ins glücksbasierte, abstrakte und hochtechnische Spielprinzip. Das wird verstärkt durch eine traurige Optik, sehr viel Downtime sowie eine lückenhafte und sprachlich schauerliche Regel, die nicht an Tiere oder ein Wettrennen erinnert, sondern an ein weltfremdes Handbuch für Nerds in perfektem Tech-Sprech. Wer möchte, dass sein Spiel nicht gespielt wird: So sollte man es anstellen.

This is a typical take it or leave it game for me.  We may have gotten a rule wrong, and if that's the case, this could go up to a 6 or maybe a 7, but definitely no higher.  There are just too many cards to go over...too many symbols to grok through and optimize.  This can make a cheetah play at the level of a sloth.  Also there appears to be a dominant strategy of matching continents to animals in that continent.  The continent symbols are wild for that continent.

RATING: 9
Players are trying to get the most victory points by evolving, moving and migrating their creatures across the Earth.  

Original feeling game that is part race game, and part card engine game, where players can introduce up to six species of creature of different classes (small mammal, reptile, etc), and evolve/adapt that animal to better be able to move across the various habitats.

The habitats are six game boards representing the continents of Earth (no Antarctica), each with a linear trace that the creatures move across.  As creatures move, the first ones there pick up goodies and bonuses to be used later in the game, or worth victory points if unused.

Mechanically simple game, but there is a lot going on through the card play mechanics.  In the spirit of games such as Paths of Glory, cards are very versatile here - used four or five different ways - so there is a lot to consider on your turn.  

Personally, I loved it - excellent game.

It might be a little long, but this is an enjoyable race game of sorts, where you are trying to climb any of 6 different ladders with your 6 tokens.   The sheer number of cards in the decks makes the game appealing.   It's a satisfying "thinky fun" sort of game.   The player aids are excellent in terms of content.   The art and presentation of the other components leaves a little to be desired.   It looks a bit cheap and flat.

Richard Breese’s new game is highly original and breaks the mould of the usual Euro fare. On the one hand it is a race up the tracks, and on the other it is one of optimising your tableau of cards to create a synergy between them all. If you take too long on the latter you’ll get left behind on the former. But if you ignore the ‘engine’ and take short term gains you’ll ultimately get left behind. 
I have only played once and there is so much to explore. Great artwork too.

All in all a highly original game, and a welcome return for a race theme and mechanic in a solid Euro.

2015-10-18 : Fiddly beyond belief. That could be forgivable were it not for the atrocious gameplay. There's zero strategic choices to be made here. You make the best of it with the cards you get, so in essence it's a puzzle game. 

But puzzle games require good layout and graphics and this game has components straight out of the nineties - I've seen better homemade print & play games than this one. Bad layout and graphics choices abound here. Didn't anyone spot that the zones on the continents are barely visible for instance ?

But it sorta works I guess, that's why it still gets a 4

The use of card symbols to build your creatures as well as trigger which ones can move on a turn is clever indeed, but overall I find the game a failure. It simply collapses under its own weight. This is a case of design where less would have been so much more. 

It’s basically a solitaire optimization puzzle where you occasionally look up to see what others are doing. The complexity of using your cards effectively is such that everybody is forced to focus on tinkering inside their own garage with little ability to incorporate what other players are doing. Every now and then you take your car out of your garage for a spin then back in the garage for more tinkering. It’s great for people who like these kinds of solitaire exercises where everybody builds their own engine and the primary interaction is asking “Are you done? Is it my turn?” 

The result is a dry affair that would best be implemented as a solitaire game. I think Lewis and Clark does this card-based racing game with icon management so much better for how it incorporates other players' actions into your decisions.

+ I love games that give you a card and let you take multiple actions with it, this game does that expertly.
+ Great theme and artwork.
+ It's just really fun, you feel a sense of attachment/accomplishment while evolving your creatures.
- Because of how many meaningful decisions you make with limited cards, there can be a bit of AP in those so prone.

RATING: 5
Would have love to love. Did not. Lots of downtime, AP-prone, very weak interaction, control quite absent. Kind of a multiplayer solitaire puzzle-optimisation game. Nice art but poor design (impossible to assess other player's tableau, board crowded by grahics with hard-to-follow tracks, etc.). To bad, I still love the theme and the fun of the few first turns. Still gets a 5 for this and graphics ... and because I still want to believe that it is better with less players. I should try it again with less players. And soon, because I do not want to have to read that ruleset again.

Overall, I didn't care for this.  While I like the building up of the creatures, and adding more symbols to them, and parts of the racing aspect, overall I don't think it comes together as a whole.  The theme didn't really come together, everthing seems a bit disjointed, and if you don't get the right cards, you won't get good combos.

The art direction of this looked like something you'd see in a catalog for school stuff that teachers would buy.

Meglepő módon ez egy tablóépítős kártyajáték leginkább. Ez része elég jóra is sikerült mind mechanika, mind tematika szempontjából. A kontinensen való lépkedés viszont valahogy nincs nekem megmagyarázva. Ráadásul a játék vége olyan szinte kiszámíthatatlan, hogy szinte értelmetlenné teszi az összes addigi tervezést. A doboz grafikája rémes. Belül inkább csak 30 évvel lemaradottnak tűnik, de az állatkás kártyák cukik legalább. 
Sokkal több kombózási lehetőség van, mint az evolúcióban, de valahogy mégse áll össze egy értelmes egésszé. Kár érte.

Looks can be deceiving. In spite of its child-like, retro-inspired box cover Inhabit the Earth is a dry optimization puzzle. The rules are fairly simple yet in order to do well, you have to carefully analyze all the available cards, traits and the positions on the various tracks. Downtime is inevitable, and since what the other players are doing is largely irrelevant most of the time, everybody just micro-manages their own private zoo.

In quite a few ways, Inhabit the Earth is not entirely unlike Lewis & Clark: race game, need matching symbols to advance, balancing act between preparation and movement, careful selection of required traits. The latter title feels much more polished, however.

Opinió després d'una lectura de regles: euro amb temàtica "d'evolució d'animals". Es juga mitjançant combinacions de cartes i en 6 tracks diferents que representen cada continent.

No he acabat de llegir regles, ho he deixat a la meitat. No m'ha convençut gens el poc que he llegit, i la temàtica em sembla molt poc atrayent. Només m'interessava per ser de un dels autors del Keyflower, però res a veure...

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy the thoughtful card play and puzzle aspects here (as will many eurogamers), but the game does suffer from large downtime (primarily due to lengthy/fiddly movement actions in the latter half of the game). 

I also think a fantasy theme with mythical creatures would have suited these mechanics better. As it stands, it adopts legitimate zoology as its theme, only to make a mockery of it (e.g. bears evolving into lions and koalas migrating to America).

Well i don't know about this one. The theme is great and the game is the same. I love multipurpose cards, i love tableu building and this game grants them in a very clever way. However i don't like such slow paced games with too complicated rules. It is intented to be a race game after all... This could be a very nice elegant one but instead this failed at such an important part. This has very good depth but to manage in every area is almost impossible to do.

RATING: N/A
Inhabit the Earth is a race game, with specific power cards offering multiple uses, but not the plethora one gets in RftG, GtR or Innovation.

Players introduce, increase, adapt and evolve creatures, which then move on ascending paths through 6 continents- no Antarctica or Penguins here that I saw (have to settle for Puffins).

As they ascend, they become more valuable for endgame, and also encounter tokens which can be used for movement, or saved for endgame.

While there are many choices, Breese has boiled them down to very simple actions so that there needn't be a lot of downtime, and I expect the game will fly once people understand the options and goals.

Not rating this yet, but it's a nice offering from the R&D catalog, and seems loaded with quality and goodness like all their games.

It hits some of the same notes that Evolution does for me--you're upgrading your creatures with cards. The upgrades are centered on being able to move more on the board (or at least potential to do so) than to being able to affect other players.

There are only two negatives about this game that I can think of:

1) It's mostly multiplayer solitaire despite it being a racing game and the deck 3 scoring cards

2) Turns can be slow since it's hard to visualize what you're going to do in your head before your turn, and some decisions can be difficult such as which continent you're planning on starting/finishing in, and which card to use for movement which gets more complicated if your going to take a turn to adapt/multiply/evolve first.

Otherwise the mechanics and art are great, the game is just a little brain burny, it's best played with no more than 3 players who are disposed to liking a dry card engine building game in the first place.

Ignore the cover art. This is a serious game, where you are racing up the circle of life. You enhance/evolve/etc your creatures so they are better and can move faster.

Inhabit the Earth has players conducting six parallel races on six continents for rewards. Players choose one out of three actions each turn. Either they manage their animals, i.e. play out their hand to increase the power of their tableuas, they move their animals on the board or they redraw cards. The thematic integration is nicely done but under the thin theme layer the rough mechanisms shine through. Following an activation of a card with all the small elements present and the various card effects from players' tableaus removes this game from the realm of family games into gamers territory.

The retro cover taken from Abenteuer Tierwelt aroused my interest. The actual gameplay dampened my enthusiasm. Playing well is a difficult and slow puzzle. Turns tend to be long with nothing for the other players to do. Playing casually will lead to suboptimal results. The special skills of the first and second tier of cards are not interesting and diversified enough to keep my interest at a level necessary to master the puzzle. Selecting the fitting VP cards from the second and third tier of cards is non-challenging. I would have preferred a more intuitive less mechanistic gaming experience given the inspiration for this game.

RATING: 5
I like the way board games have become an insular enough hobby where we can have cover art that references other games and have enough people catch on that it means something.

But unfortunately the game itself is dull. It's way too complicated for family play, yet not really convincing in its mechanics for me to want to invest a lot of time into it. I can see how this would get better with more play, but I'm not really willing to put in the effort.

RATING: 6
A kind of a race game where the actual goal is not to cross any of the finish lines, but more about getting to good positions in the races before you or anyone else crosses the finish line. Gameplay is smart, but doesn't excite much, it feels rather like a mix of tried mechanisms. Also, after all these years English rule writing is unnecessarily complicated and clumsy.

RATING: 4
Rating based on 1 play.  Felt like mutliplayer solitaire.  Made it through the whole game without really knowing what the other players were doing and gameplay wouldn't have changed if I did.  Theme evaporates quickly.  Animals quickly just become symbols.  I understand this might be a throwback to a older game and the designer's wifes does the artwork but the 6-board "map" and amateur art aren't on par with modern games.

The game works mechanically. It is not broken.

But...

1. It is an abstract game where the theme actually hurts it. You cannot explain any of the rules thematically because they make no sense. And now your tiger is evolving into a brown bear...What? Are you serious? Now your brown bear is migrating from Australasia to North America...Why? 

2. It is sooooo boooorrrriiiinnnnggg. It takes forever to play the first game with no pay off. I am going to trigger movement, this matches this,and this matches that, and that matches this...snooooooooze.

3. It is random. Take an entire turn to draw five cards. Nothing you wanted? Too bad, throw them all away in subsequent turns and then spend another turn to draw more. Still not what you wanted? 

4. Graphic design and production are garbage. The powers are text blocks with no iconography and are often very unclear with the more complex powers. But worry not, there is an index in the back for clarification...THAT TELLS YOU ABSOLUTELY NOTHING USEFUL!!! The maps do not clearly distinguish the regions, which is the only thing they need to do.

I rated this a 3 when I started writing this and I am changing it to a 2. So disappointed.

I love multi-use cards + theme + art + racing element, but it didn't mix together as well as I hoped. 
The biggest problem I can point to is the the downtime. Even with only 2 players it can take a while to decide which cards you are going to discard and which ones you use for adapting/evolving/multiplying. Movement also takes time. Maybe with more experience it goes quicker.

RATING: 3
What an awful experience this was. A lot of downtime and most of the time some of the players are moving their animals in a board and at the same time they are bookkeeping what symbols they have used and what's still left - there is nothing what other players can do at the same time. The bookkeeping system ruins the whole game and is from '90s / old-school. 4th player don't bring nothing else but even more downtime so forget it AND play it with max three players. Other big issue are the special scoring animals of other players, which you can't see at your place (cards are missing clear symbols) - but which you need to know - if you want to play the game competitively. -> So I found some big usability issues as well. Shit, this is so far from Breese's best games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Evolution (theme, cards, herds) meets Lewis & Clark (movement, cards, race) meets Keltis (race on 6 different tracks with more and more same-colored cards, collecting tiles along the way, scoring for markers' positions after similar end conditions), even with cards used/doveloped more or less like in Innovation, meets Richard Breese...
Pro: 
- as a result of this mix, the game feels rather unique
- theme and attention to thematic details (no, I have no problem with one animal evolving into a completely different other animal)
- artwork (I do like it - it's old-fashioned, clear and playful, at last not one of those run-of-the-mill fantasy paintings)
- evolving/mutating etc. your races is fun
- racing is fun
- interesting balance in timing your actions
Con:
- minor con: some component inconsistencies - e.g. little yellow tokens are used to HIGHLIGHT your current position and/or to COVER certain spaces on the board
- very low interaction for such a long game, with longer and longer downtimes
- too long first 'part' with too little scores compared to the scores you can gain in your last few rounds
- While the game does allow lots of space for clever play, cards can still mean an unfortunate amount of luck for such a heavy thinking game. Obviously a part of it can be mitigated by clever play, but in a game where the winner scores 30-35 points, a lousy player with a lucky draw can still get 10-12 points or even more from the cards drawn in their very last round while another one might get zero points from the same action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The down time is the major problem here. As some turns will take a while, players tend to notice it more. Even though the game will play in 90-120 minutes, it feels longer.  Ended up selling my copy although I'd be happy to play other people's copies. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Multiple uses for cards here which always intrigues me in a game. One is evolving up to 6 different creature species which ideally will combine traits to move along tracks in one of the continents really quickly. Make no mistake - this is a race game of sorts and the end of the game can come pretty suddenly. I'd ignore the short teaching game - just jump to the regular game. Be aware that a number of the second the third age cards potentially grant considerable end game points and you want to mutate your different species to gain points if possible. 

There can be considerable downtime in the game waiting for others to go but you can use some of that to plan your turn...potentially. Outside of being able to jump across spaces where opponents are, you don't really interact with anyone else so this is almost entirely multiplayer solitaire.

[b][thing=181797][/thing][/b] is fairly simple as there are only three actions of which you get to do one each turn: play animal cards to your tableau, draw new animal cards, or move your animal tokens around the world.  The brilliance of the game is that as simple as the rules are, it's not so simple to play well.  There's just a lot to analyse from your animal's traits to it's position on the board and the terrain that it must pass through that I could definitely see some analysis paralysis happening.  Fortunately though, much of one's analysis can be done on another player's turn as the board state doesn't change that often or that quickly (at least not until the nearly the end of the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First impression only after one 3p and one 2p introductory game.  MPS, medium weight tableau builder.  I generally tend to dislike/be indifferent to MPS games.  
As intended by its designer it has a Euro level of low interactivity with mostly positive reinforcement.  This reinforces the MPS aspect/flavor of the game.  It also reinforces the downtime, and lack of interest in paying attention to other players during their turn.  I think this is the nature of the design.  I regret buying it and am ready to trade it or sell it after only a couple of plays.
My main criticism is that it is a game that requires an investment of time and studying that is significant enough to make the game not a casual proposition or a filler.  It could attract heavy gamers (I am one) but then again there are better heavy games out there (more interactive and interesting).  It makes the game compete squarely against other better MPS (e.g., Terraforming Mars) and other games that I prefer that are not MPS.
The theme is non-existent/pasted on.  The graphics are unique and charming.  The mechanics are elegant and easy to apply.  The tableau building allows for many variations.  The game is very tactical/reactive but allows for some strategical tableau building.

[b]First Impressions:[/b] 
-Dense rule book, but it all starts to click after a few rounds of play.  
-Getting the terminology down for the different parts of the menagerie action is the next toughest part to grasp, but still not too bad since the terms make thematic sense.
-I was afraid it was going to be much tougher to teach than it actually was.
-I love multi use cards so this is right up my alley.  Has a bit of a Race for the Galaxy feel (which is one of my favorite games) where you need to watch your tempo compared to your opponents. 
-I can't imagine this will be a fun game to play with AP prone gamers.  There are a lot of things to consider when determining how to use your cards.
-I don't think this is a game that will be good for occasional play.  You will need to dedicate a decent number of plays to gain familiarity with the combos available, plus how best to move along the continents.  
-After a couple of plays, this is already a game that makes me want to play it better.  Even when I'm winning, I know it's possible I could do better.  Imperial Settlers is another game that gives me that sort of feeling.
-Brain is mush afterwards, at least until I gain more experience and can play more intuitively.

[b]Frequency of play:[/b] As stated above, it will need a lot of upfront plays to gain familiarity with the game.  It also feels like the type of game where you need to be in the right mood to play it so that may hurt it chances to get to the table.

This is a good game.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't getting played enough.

I like the special powers, the hand management aspects, the puzzle of movement and migration, choosing how one scores.

Played once, 3-pl. I was keen to try this, but I was slightly disappointed. Like many tableau-builders, it´s quite multi-solitaire. And that´s almost a good thing, because this is the kind of game where I can either deliberate real long or just play half-well and be home before midnight. Let´s say you decide to move your creatures. You know you want to move your lion, but which one of your seven cards lets you move the most classes, and what classes can move the most and collect tokens? There is quite some icon-matching to do there. If you or your friends are prone to AP, I suggest you steer away fromt his one. I can see it working real well as a solo game, where the AI would place and advance creatures. All this said, I´m willing to play again. Will it play quicker a second time? Probably.

Desipte the lack of good design on the box (target seems to be children which are too young to play the game) and the use of the same color for more than one function (continent and player had same color without being connected) this is a clever game with tactics and fun. The use of the cards is well done, building on top, bottom, upside-down or use as payment without being confusing.

Enjoyed my first play of this, though I admit I was probably more concerned with evolving/adapting a cool animal than racing the tracks. The points come from various places including some that require you to know what other players have or are doing, which does not appeal to everyone. I'd like to play it more, especially to explore the different avenues and find cool combos (which are definitely present).

Inhabit the Earth is a charming, creative, and engaging brain-burner. If you like playing games that feature cards with multiple uses, and if you enjoy point to point races on colorful maps, than you've found a great match. It takes about five plays before you understand how the cards emerge, the patterns of play, and the multiple paths to victory. Every creature in your menagerie matters, and you have many choices as to how those creatures will evolve. Will they have the flexibility to migrate, or the special terrains that are unique to a specific continent? Will they race ahead quickly or focus more on their scoring interactions with other creatures? Don't worry about the frivolous evolutionary ecology. Just use your imagination and broaden your time span. Don't worry about the anthropomorphic art. It's lovely and appealing. Don't worry about the seemingly dizzying choices. After five games it all fits together. This game is worth the time investment, especially for two players. Once you know what you're doing two players can finish the game in an hour. Similar to Reef Encounter and Keyflower, Richard Breese has created an interesting game that takes familiar mechanisms and matches them in totally original ways. 

There is one aspect of the evolutionary ecology that is uniquely realistic and interesting. The terrain features of each continent roughly correspond to the contemporary biomes. So for a creature to successfully race it must match its terrain strengths to the unique south to north biome characteristics of each continent. Very cool! This game abounds with neat little features like that. 

After several weeks of constant play, I'm upgrading this to a  10. As we've gotten more familiar with the cards, we have a better understanding of how the game will unfold. You can win with great scoring cards and combos, or by racing quickly to the finish. This game is all about tempo. When do you abandon species development and race full speed ahead? When do you choose to emphasize scoring cards? When do you choose to migrate to another continent? This is one of the best new games in several years.

I got to be honest and say that the cover art of the game has put me off of the game... when I saw it I thought the game would be a simple gateway family/children's game...

When I was told that the main mechanic was Cards with multiple use my interest got peaked and I ended up buying it at Essen and that wasn't one of the games on the To Buy List!

I like the art of the game with spooky creepy eyes and all  it had to be an immense work to get all those creatures in the game, there are no repeats and there are a LOT of cards... some cards repeat the powers they have but the art and the animal in them is always unique and that is pretty cool if you ask me!

I really like the way movement is done, the way you use a card to trigger the movement of Creatures that have any of the 3 symbols on the card you used, and then, in the order you have introduce them to the world they will move... and the way they move is also pretty awesome... you have to match the icon on the next free spot on the region the creature is... if the creature doesn't have it you can use the Continent symbol that the creature is in as a wild and you keep doing this until there are no more symbols on the creature that you can use or until you want to stop, and then you go to the next creature that can move...

It's a very cool game that I'm glad to own and another reminder to not judge a book by it's cover... despite looking "childish" it's very much a gamers game!!

A very smart hybrid of Innovation and generic racing games, featuring some of the most gorgeous and playful card art we've seen for many a year. Just take a look at the Slender Loris and tell me you don't melt a little bit.

There is a sizeable amount of downtime, even with fast players, and the card-draw can be frustrating, but these are only small scratches on an excellent facade.

This is my favourite game by Richard even supplanting his Key series for me ( only just mind you )...rules may seem intimidating at first as very dense ...but once playing it does not take long to start thinking about what to do rather than how it's done ...and boy can that hurt your brain ...although some choices can be quite obvious ...deciding what animal to optimally use when and where is key ...but as in all good games playing optimally is not always easy ...

I love the art ...but I imagine it's a bit love or hate ...

Excellent component production, thick boards, excellent card stock, and equally thick counters and tile stand ...

Don't play with those prone to AP unless you have a timer lol...

Brilliant card play! don't be afraid of the rulebook, because it's having too detailed information that it make the game seems more complex than it seems, but actually is very easy to remember and smooth play, of course the game is AP prone :) on my first play i just jumped on to the full game, skipping the introductory rules, the game last 2 and a half hour, did not regret it :), bravo Mr.Breese

Updated rating after another play:
A deep game...I am not even close to understanding the strategy of it after one playing. Tough choices in the beginning as cards stay and do not move out of the game. No catchup mechanism if you fail to spot a clear leader in the continents, so every decision counts. Recommended for abstract gamers. Has nothing to do with the theme.

Inhabit the Earth is a race game that is based on card play that reminded me a lot of Innovation--you play new stacks and tuck cards under or place them on top to gain access to new icons or card text. Your card stacks each represent an animal species that is trying to race up the track of one of six continents using their symbols to traverse the various terrain types. On the whole, I thought it was a pretty interesting game, but it may snowball a bit as people assemble a card drawing engine.

Excellent game but has a lot of downtime. I think 2-3 players works well, but 4 might be pushing it. It's got a Lewis and Clark feel to it mixed with a bit of Bruges. A lot of similar abilities on the cards, but the icons and timing really makes the game sing. I'm rather impressed with the overall feel of it.

Not sure I can go above a 7 since the game is good but ultimately flawed due to more downtime than I'd like in a game. It may rise a point though if I become familiar enough with the cards and the turns become more interactive/focused when it's not my turn.

Edit: A second play in after a long while and yes, the downtime is just as bad as I remember it. It's still enjoyable, but the movement phase can take a while and since you can't really plan too much on someone elses turn, it can feel longer than it needs to be. Again, I think card knowledge would speed up and ultimately make this game more enjoyable, but I can't in good conscious make it higher than a 7 as of right now.

A future playing tip, but keep an eye on the icons near the upper half of the map. Adapting or evolving to give you more of those icons is critical. I found my movement massively hampered once I got to level 3 with most of my creatures.

This is one of those games which is classically "greater than the sum of its parts". Not that the parts are lacking, but somehow the way they are woven together inseparably becomes a thing of magic. The art is hilarious... and I can't imagine it any other way that would be better. It captures the spirit of almost manic joy that infuses this game. I love setting an animal into motion and snagging a couple tokens, then applying those tokens onto another animal allowing it to move and snagging a few more... it just keeps rolling on itself. The flexibility is engaging and satisfying, and the endless variety of animals I can build I want to explore over and over again. And while I am deciding whether I want to evolve into an elephant or multiply my herbivores or just adapt my boa and give it the couple of symbols it needs to boost over the edge, those animals are just grinning at me conspiratorily. They are in on it. They are happy with whatever decision I make. 

The tradeoffs between expanding my menagerie or just keeping a couple extra cards and move a couple turns in a row will never be solved. It is an art every time. This game gets better every time I play it.

RATING: 6.5
Hand management card game to try and evolve your species. You want to move up the tracks and try to score points in on the different continents. It is interesting and I should play it again. A bit fiddly- and potential for AP players. You can have very long turns. I am not a fan of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Mmm, looks cute, the theme of introducing, adapting, multiplying and migrating up to 6 classes of animals appeals to me.
 
However, the strongest vibe is high AP potential because of the complex puzzle of using multi-function cards (coupled with text rule-breakers etc) to determine the best sequence or avenue with the best payout. 

Also I thought it may be an educational experience but it now appears to be less about learning facts about animals and more emphasis on fantastical situations e.g. a platypus crossing a mountain.

This is a cute idea for a game, that ultimately just isn't that interesting to play. You get these animal cards that all have different powers. You enhance the animals by splaying other cards over or under them in different ways. Your stacking limit of cards is determined by how many different animals you have on the board. Cards can also be played to move your animals that have a matching symbol. This is a lengthy process when players have six different animals of different sizes and complexity. There is some AP in terms of trying to maximize your efficiency before your turn, as the game rewards getting to the end areas, but since during movement you skip over places where other people are, the board state can be unpredictable. Maybe the problem was just that we played it with 4 players, which pushed the downtime between turns too high. Again, the game is fine, it just didn't present me with any hard choices. I just did the best I could with what I drew and what the board state looked like.

Only 1 play.  Mechanics seem cobbled together from other titles and varnished with a extremely thin coating of zoological theme.  How are reptiles and sea mammals related?  How did my lion migrate to central Asia?  Six racing tracks eat up a lot of real estate on the table.  I was most disappointed that the bulk of the scoring options are not presented until the middle of the game, and are circumstantial in most (all?) cases.  The activation of cards is a fun mechanism but is implemented better elsewhere.

Love the art.  Deus is a better game with a similar tactical depth and much worse art.  In fact, I think Deus could be rethemed with this ecological theme of habitat niches and fitness testing to appeal to a broader audience.  Sacrifice becomes extinction, etc. 10% please. 

It is entertaining enough but the rules a little much for the hour of game play this allows, and the rule book is very dense for the complexity of the game.  Try before you buy.

I love the multi-use cards and racing across all of the continents. So many choices to be made, and it all feels extremely satisfying...until you realize how much of your final score relies on luck of the draw. Still, part of the charm of Inhabit thr Earth is working with what you get. If you go digging for the perfect card you'll likely fall behind. I'd like to see a variant where players draft some tier 3 cards at the very beginning, but they would have to be set aside until tier 3 is unlocked (and so they don't take up space against your precious hand limit)

--Dec2015-- I'm imperfectly convinced.  The game is a lovely production, and very clever.  But it's not anywhere near as clear as I might (lazily, perhaps) prefer:  I was finding I needed to read (and re-read) all the top cards in play more often than I might prefer.  For the moment then, my rating is very soft.  Perhaps I just need to encourage a notepad?

Sold!

It's got nice animals and very simple rules (don't let the rulebook fool you). Essentially we're talking about a race game with modified points... look, it's about the cute little animals, right!

I like almost everything about the game except particularly the slowdown of the movement action. We try and help each other along, but compared to all the other options it drags, especially as the end of the game nears and players rush to finish it off. We've started having players play their turns simultaneously if the preceding player isn't moving.

So far a pure movement, movement, movement strategy seems to be dominating. Build up one or two creatures especially then breed then move, move, move until you need to breed again to acquire new trigger cards. Rinse and repeat. We've tried to bring this strategy down with top quality VP evolving, but new cards are just as easy for the movement players to pick up and fish out a few good VP animals on the fly. So it seems that this is the way we're all meant to play. It seems, yes, it's definitely a race game.

If there's a new edition one day then a small tweak of the graphic design better distinguishing the level 2 area would be nice. A little darker shading or a dotted line perhaps? 

All in all a fun game, but with a little more potential lurking there somewhere.

遊戲以物種進化和遷徙為背景，玩家要控制物種，讓他們一邊進化一邊遷徙，去尋找最適合自己的棲息地。說白了就是一個賽跑+手牌管理的遊戲……不過規則上設計得十分巧妙，並且很有新意，生物需要通過繁殖或進化來適應更多的地形和氣候，這個過程在前期非常緩慢，但是一旦一種生物累積了足夠多的優勢，就會像開掛一樣直接沖向食物鏈的頂端。不過畢竟是卡牌遊戲，運氣成分還是無法避免的……
http://tieba.baidu.com/p/4432212175

物種大遷徙！這是一個競速遊戲，玩家在六塊大陸上控制不同種類的動物登上大陸的最高點。遊戲在兩個動物登上頂峰的時候立刻結束，每個玩家根據動物位置和一些動物能力進行最後算分。
這個遊戲讓我的感覺很複雜。遊戲規則聽起來超級棒，每回合你可以進化動物，繁衍動物又或者移動動物，具體規則比較複雜有興趣可以看說明書。聽完規則我覺得好好玩，玩完第一個回合也是這個感覺。但是很快的每個人面前開始出現一溜子牌，自己的技能都要忘記更不要說記得別人的技能了。最後有些牌的end game bonus各種淫霸，你跑再快沒有用，別人隨隨便便靠著一張所有動物在大陸最底層直接秒殺你。我以為會有louis and clark的那種你追我趕的感覺，但是實際上非常的multiplayer solitarie。BGG評分標準可以打5分吧。遊戲的art水準真的不忍直視，封面所有動物都像咖啡喝多了

(playtest comment) Some possibily counter-intuitive ideas that will probably cause players to mess things up [or maybe that was just me. :)]  As noted in the geeklist, the terminology is very precise but once you have a handle on it, everything flows well.
There are a surprising variety of strategies to pursue, and "winning" the race doesn't always lead to victory.  And the evolution part has that perfect blend of difficult decisions crossed with anecdotal outcomes, even if it's biologically suspect.
(edit: possibly too much AP with a full complement of players, and the turn sequence doesn't really get any quicker with experience, but there's definitely more depth here than initially appears.)
(edit2: definitely too much AP, but there are so many tricks here to discover.  It's unfortunate that most of them require too many games to become evident though...)

Decent game, but I'm not a big fan of how it ends.  I really dislike games that just stop suddenly, especially with the last turn being so (potentially) valuable for playing scoring cards.  There is a great deal of luck involved with drawing the right cards for end game scoring as well, so I think in a lot of games the winner will be decided more by who draws the right cards than skillful play.

RATING: 5
This is a racing game played by evolving or adapting different kinds of animals across 6 of the 7 continents.  In this game players can play 6 different types of animals and evolve and adapt (essentially just playing new cards underneath or over top of them) them to gain new abilities and symbols corresponding to icons on the map.  Once you have these icons you can move these species across the continents depending on which icons on the cards match the ones on the continent until two people reach the end of two continent tracks and the most points wins.

This game really disappointed me honestly.  I haven't played a ton of Richard Breese games but love the two I have (Keythedral and Keyflower).  I also really liked the art style with all the goofy high animals and the idea of 162 unique animal cards with special powers.

Well, first of all, the 162 unique animal cards are really misleading because between those 162 unique animals there are maybe a couple dozen unique powers.  Many of the animals all do the same exact thing which also makes choices in this game really inconsequential.  Games where you have to discard cards to play others or put them underneath a pile to use their symbols but lose access to their special powers should be interesting based on the opportunity costs of the decisions you make.  But here, it's really easy to just discard this card or slide it under this pile because you already have that card power on your board and anothe one in your hand.

Past that the game is really kinda boring and I'm not sure there is more than one viable strategy, that being stacking continent icons on one creature type and moving as often as possible until you win.  There are lots of other good race games and without the really unique card powers I was expecting there's nothing to set this one, where you just move based on terrain and continent symbols on your cards, apart from others with very similar mechanics.  In fact, the mechanics of this game felt very, very similar to a great racing game, Lewis and Clark.  And Lewis and Clark is much better because it has tons of cards each with their own unique and interesting power.

I do still like the goofy high animals and the quality of the components is fair to good but the game is really disappointing.

One has to wonder how such a poor marketing decision was made?

The game is not difficult to pick up, but there is a LOT going on right from the start. AP is very possible on 'Menagerie' turns ('Breed' goes fast, and 'Movement' is reasonable too).

tl;dr: enjoyable puzzle

I really like the puzzle this game gives you: how can you combine the resources and special actions to gather the most points? Should you migrate to a different continent? Should you just increase the capabilities or change the special action?
There certainly is a significant luck of the draw, but that's part of the challenge: working with what you get. I guess you can get really hosed by drawing the wrong cards for your strategy, but I think in most cases you'll be able to figure out a strategy that works.
The only real issue I have with the game - other than the less than attractive graphic design - is the instant game end. It feels very unfair it you've had one less turn and would also have been able to end the game in the same round. That really blows. I don't see why Richard wouldn't allow the other players to finish the round and score some additional points. The difference can be dramatic.

There are just a few actions, but there are so many variations on cards that it seems like each game will progress differently.  I spent most of my first play just figuring out all the interactions on the mechanics of the game.  The most experienced player blew us out of the water, which is a good sign.  I plan to use a more focused strategy next time and not try to advance every single creature type.  I also plan to pay more attention on when to make the pivot between creature cards and scoring cards.  Nice production and I like the card art a lot even though the cover art kind of creeps me out.

Inhabit the Earth has a terrible, terrible rule book. The game itself is quite interesting, though I'm not quite sure that I like the way that the scoring is implemented. Essentially, you start a race game, trying to climb up the tracks, bounce around where you can to collect extra points and can thrive. Then, as you get into level 2 and eventually 3, you start collecting scoring cards and you're then just trying to churn through cards to find scoring cards that match what you have - or trying to find cards that you can easily adjust to in order to score. And so many of them are completely situational. It felt very much as though a series of mechanisms had a scoring system bolted on fairly late on in the development and the two don't really fit together for me.

The tableau building is Innovation with permanent splay right, however this game feels nothing like Innovation.  It is a race game, where the powers are somewhat similar in strength and efficiency is the key.  The players don't snowball from any action except the movement phase, so its an interesting balance between building for enhanced movement and having the most powerful actions available.  Tucking is fairly common for those familiar with Innovation.  It seems to mostly reward specialization, but the game throws you a few bones to encourage diversity.

There is a neat system here.  It plays pretty easily, and the tradeoffs in animal building is fairly interesting.  

The game plays pretty quickly until the movement phases in the second half of the game.  With experience it should move faster, but its pretty rough as it is just downtime at that point.  I'm enjoying it for now though.

Players populate the earth with their menagerie of six animals in this area movement, card driven board game. It's a race to get to scoring points on the continents. Interesting card puzzle of symbols for region, animal type, and terrain. These symbols are used differently on each side ot the card face which are used to match animals for migrating along "game trails" or spend new cards to adapt your animals to new conditions, or flip the animal cards to breed. Pretty interesting choices. Thematically, the "hopping" of animals to new continents in migration is odd. I like this game more than I was expecting and would play it again.

Feels like a combination of Innovation (with more control) and a race game with spatial elements.  Game play is simpler than the rules make it appear, and the player aid is excellent (and all you'll need after the first couple of turns).  Don't play with the AP-prone, and think when it's not your turn.  The shift from using early game special powers to mid and late game scoring powers is interesting as is deciding when to surge on the boards.  Once players start to know what the powers and scoring options are, then making decisions about how to configure each type of animal will get more interesting.  Interesting right on the first play though.

I love the mechanisms of this game, but the inability to do much during the downtime makes the game take about an hour per player. The single most time-consuming action is movement, and guess which action is completely susceptible to everyone else's, and thus must really be planned and executed on your turn, 'cause it's going to get messed up anyway.

As a solitaire game, with a simple rule to clutter the path with opponents to jump over, I think this game would be an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b].

"Never sell or trade games shelf" - Nobody knows or cares about this game. The box looks like a children's book cover. Don't be fooled, this game is killer in so many ways. Get a copy before you can't.

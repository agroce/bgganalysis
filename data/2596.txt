Played with 4 : Wife, brother-in-law, my son (5 1/2 yo) and myself. We played freestyle without couting points. We still had lots of fun though. I'll be looking forward playing with couting points, I can see how it would push people to do scary moves on the villa.

The game keeps slipping down the ratings but I still think its brilliant.  I think its been supplanted by Animal upon Animal due to the cute animals and Hamsterolle due to the cute "theme".  And neither involves the big scary crush of pieces.

After a couple years with this game, I actually think this game deserves the SDJ more.  Its a great family stacking game.  Just pure awesomeness with the right crowd.

Always fun to watch it all fall down!  Just hard to get Jing into it...Works really well for more people, extremely happy I got it and not surprised that it stole the SdJ from PR - I think PR is more derving but after a few heavy games, I think there must have been a backlash and the committee went for pure lightness.  Pair this with a crokinole set and I would have have the perfect physical gaming collection!

Awesome dexterity/party game.  Best when not taken too seriously (maybe with a few drinks after dinner..just watch out for when it falls down!).  Perfect game for playing with non-gamers as well.

Nice, but which do you need - a glass of wine AFTER playing it or BEFORE?  

Also works well with kids and families.  A lot of fun and it looks good, too.

I think Hamsterolle is better, but this knocks Jenga for 6.  There's a lot of good manipulation games out there, but this can hold its own.

This is not Jenga.  Jenga is about dexterity and imperfections in the material leading to uneven stresses.  This can be played as a real-space strategy game based on positioning blocks and floors so that various removals will/will not be structurally sound *even if executed perfectly*.  I've seen people pick up a tempting high-scoring piece that wasn't supporting anything, only to see the tower tip over as a crucial counterweight was removed.  The complicated-sounding scoring system works to provide incentives to take more risky pieces.

RATING: 7
Great for playing with "non-gamers", even my grandparents (almost 90 years old at the time) enjoyed it. The only problem is having to start all over again once the tower comes tumbling down. The real world could really use an "undo" feature.

A less stupid Jenga, as it got some interesting desitions to be made (e.g. 'where will I play my pieces?', 'Should put the next level in?', etc.). I'm not really much of a dexterity fan, but I enjoyed enough that I wouldn't mind another go at it.

[b]Spiel des Jarhes 2002[/b]
[color=#959595][size=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 4th Place 2002[/size][/color]

[i]Posted: 1/6/09, Rated: 6[/i]
{2P: 6, 3P: 6, 4P: 7}

[i]Villa Paletti[/i] has taken a lot of grief for having won the [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/url][/i] in 2002, but I can see why it did.  It's brightly-colored: high color saturation is a common theme amongst recent winners.  It's simple to learn -- another requirement.  It also earns a full set of marks for introducing a new mechanism which hasn't been done in previous winners: it's a dexterity game.  Had [gameid=2452] won in a previous year, then [i]Villa Paletti[/i] wouldn't have had a chance.

The detail that really surprises me is that it was considered for the [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Deutscher_Spiele_Preis]Deutscher Spiele Preis[/url][/i].  I think of that prize as being more of a "gamer's game," which usually means it is more robust and intricate than the winner of the SdJ.  Yet here is a simple game which was highly regarded by both panels.  So what's the deal here?

[i]Villa Paletti[/i] is a quirky-looking game.  The "floors" look like they were conceived as set pieces for a Tim Burton movie.  The resultant structures they produce look fantastical and absurd.  Where most games focus on the accumulation of points or progress towards an end goal, here the journey itself is the game.  [i]Villa Paletti[/i] does a good job of looking fun along the way.  For this reason alone I sought out the Zoch Verlag version of the game, rather than the University Games one.

The game is ornate filler at best.  It is most enjoyable when all four colors belong to actual players, rather than using the kludge of a rule of having neutral colors that must also be moved during a player's turn.  At the same time, it's not really a "party" game because it can't support more than four players.  Thus, [i]Villa Paletti[/i] falls into a no-mans land within my collection: there are other 4p games I'd rather play, yet it doesn't scale to be considered for larger groups.

An expansion which added new floor shapes and different-colored pillars to support more players would build up my rating for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A dexterity game.  Players remove columns from lower levels and place them on upper levels, hopefully being the one with the most points when the structure collapses.  There is some strategy - trying to place your columns in areas where you can get to them later, and place others' columns where they're hard to use.

Villa Paletti es un juego familiar y de habilidad donde los haya que tanto puede ser jugado con niños como con adultos por igual. La construcción en sí misma es colorida y divertida. El juego desarrolla capacidad y análisis en el niño en campos como el equilibrio y la estabilidad de la estructura que estamos construyendo. La necesidad de cierta destreza a la hora de retirar los pilares inferiores y colocarlos en los superiores es la base del juego. He de decir que a día de hoy todavía nunca hemos llegado a la última planta. 

Las deformaciones leves de las plantas, las micro diferencias de longitud entre piezas y explicar el bloque de puntuación (el bloque es contra intuitivo, aunque tiene sentido) son las sombras de un juego de habilidad, entretenido, divertido donde los haya.

Villa Paletti’s big and colourful wooden tiles remind those big and colourful wooden tiles that once were given the little children as construction toys: this is what I immediately thought when I first saw this game and since then I can’t shrug off the idea that this is a children’s game or a game to be played when children are around. [i](September 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a minimum: thus, since Villa Paletti deserves better, I rounded up my rating from 5,5 to 6.

My first edition was the University Games edition, made in China.  The wooden pieces were very warped and made the game, as written in the rules, unplayable.  (The rules state each new floor must be supported by at least three columns, and this was simply not possible with one particularly curved plate.)  I returned it to my local FLGS and they opened a new box and I took the best pieces of both. Game played OK but you generally couldn't build a tower beyond the yellow floor... and the red floor was ridiculously unachievable.  But it still worked as a game, strictly speaking, it was just less than satisfying.

I've now bought the Zoch edition (actually Gigamic french edition, but identical) made in Germany and the quality is FAR better.  Nothing is crooked, and now we can actually build a tower of some height and make a game out of it.

I'd like nothing better than to say the Chinese-made edition is up to par, but the difference is night and day.  I've seen three University edition sets and all suffered from significant warpage.  MAYBE if you got two or three copies and made one set out of the best pieces, you'd get a satisfying game out of it.  (I'd be wary of getting a used version for that reason.)  Or you can acquire the German-made one and be satisfied out of the box, like I was.

My University Games edition, out of the box:  [b]4/10[/b]

Nice, clean dexterity game. Maybe doesn't have the wow factor that Bausack has but it's a lot simpler and lighter which gives it an important spot in my collection.

The scoring system sucks ass. It's like they wanted to do something to make it seem better than Jenga, but since you already have pieces of different sizes it's ALREADY better, more interesting, more strategic. No reason it shouldn't just be Jenga rules, but if you really want a winner there's a ton of more elegant ways to do scoring.

ALSO I LIKE THE NEAT HOOKY THINGY!!!

More interesting than Jenga but the scoring/winning conditions are a bit unsatisfying. Maybe I've only played it with klutzes but it doesn't last long and the 'leader' (or 'would be winner' if it falls) is usually decided at the start and then doesn't change much.

Great family-oriented dexterity game. Less a game and more an activity. Much better than Jenga and if it was in Walmart and Toys-R-Us stores it would sell a ton. Actually, what it really needs is a commercial showing the game in action---that would convey the fun. 

I feel the game suffers in the end from you don't make a winning move, someone makes a losing move. I think I would rather play 4 players and eliminate whoever makes it fall over until there is one winner. The scoring seems a little unnecessary and people always screw-up way before we get high enough to make it exciting. Something needs to give to make it more of a game I feel I win rather than not lose. 

Update 08/11 
Never playing this because HamsterRolle is just so much more enjoyable and satisfying. -1 point for my rating

RATING: 7
The fact that the columns are different heights really improves the game and opens some tactical opportunities.  The obvious guideline is to not remove columns that are actually supporting the structure; not as obvious is to make sure the column you're removing doesn't provide counterweight keeping the floor from tipping over.  I found that out when I removed a column that was not even covered by the floor above, and the whole structure went toppling over.

This is a fun dexterity game that's trickier than it looks.  The brightly colored wooden pieces and the teetering tower make it look cool as the tower builds upwards.  It comes with 5 levels, but we never get past 3.  We play 2-player with two colors each (according to the "full color examples" translation under the game's files here on bgg).

After repeated playings my rating for this game has gone steadily up.  There is actually some measure of strategy, which (I think) is somewhat rare in a family dexterity game of this nature.  Also, this has incredible appeal to non-gamers, and everyone I've played with has had a good time.

Most dexterity games are not my thing. I don't dislike them, but they don't really speak out to me either. Villa Paletti is the first one that I've played where I actually enjoyed the playing of it thoroughly, and would actively like to play it again. There is something extremely enjoyable about the precarious balancing act that develops as players steal supports from the low part of the building and then put them on the top of the garish villa.

To me, this is what a party type game should be...extremely fun whether you're "winning or losing" based on your piece position, and full of tense moments. Villa also throws in good decision making skills, as it can often be difficult to tell whether or not a given support is absolutely necessary, or where the tower's centre of gravity is at.

Really nice game though, I would like to get to it again. Scoring system is wonky though, and shouldn't be taken seriously. I think of this more as an entertaining structured activity moreso than as an actual game.

Very good dexterity game.  Nice wooden pieces, but the green base plate arrived warped and I haven't been able to flatten it out (from what I've read, I'm not the first to have this problem).

Very fun, but less climactic than something like Jenga, since the structure rarely sees a complete collapse.  None of the rules (at least on my Wiggles 3D version) seem to truly address these smaller collapses, so it seems you need to either create a set of house rules, or simply play the game in more of a cooperative manner.

Not for the faint of heart, this dexterity game takes the basic idea of Jenga and turns it on its head.  Oddly shaped platforms and columns are delicately balanced, as players attempt to move up to the next level.  VERY CAREFULLY.

Constant play would be annoying, but for occasional fun this is a game that really gets everyone around the table wrapped up in the moment.  And that's good clean fun.

I always pull this out for kids or at parties. Everyone loves it. The only downsides are the setup time (which isn't any more tedious than Jenga or Toc Toc Woodman) and when some idiot thinks it's funny to pull bad pillars just to make it fall and act like a fool (probably my only time of putting it away prematurely).

Otherwise, great game. Lots to enjoy.

I can see this game could be fun - but game of the year? Personally I feel the pieces are cheap too - and although the pieces may be meant to be different lengths one gets the feeling there is little precision in the game construction. The wood used is too light (cheap 3 ply) which makes the tower less stable than it should be to encourage a really strategic approach. I can't see this getting a huge amount of play time.

There's clearly some tempo-related issues here. However, the physical system is so simple that the dexterity plays almost no part and this becomes instead a light tactical game, and probably a solvable one - or at least provably boring.

A surprisingly fun, short dexterity game - a little like Jenga, but with 3 types of pieces each worth different points, and more decisions to be made (e.g. which piece do I take from the supporting level and where do I place it so that I can grab it again easily later?).  People will stop and watch you play this one.

This tower has power...  in the building and stacking genre (like Jenga), this is the best.  It has strategy and a free-styling kind of play that is a blast.

As dexterity game goes, this one has quite a bit of strategy thrown in which makes it great. Unfortunately, the weird (I would almost say "broken") scoring system somehow hurts the game. I guess that an home-made modification to the scoring would solve that, with a more fiddly scoring.

Still, maybe the best dexterity game I have played game.

In Villa Paletti you remove building blocks from the bottom of the structure and move them to the top, always trying to keep the structure from collapsing (somewhat akin to Jenga, but really, that comparison doesn't do the game justice at all).

Interestingly, despite being a very simple game at its core, in some cases the rules get in the way of the game, adding bells and whistles where none are needed. For example, the four player game is vastly superiour to the more complicated three player "variant", to the extent that the latter doesn't seem worth playing at all.

For this reason, even though Villa Paletti is a nice enough game in its own right, I'd recommend a simpler, more focused game like Animal Upon Animal instead.

My biggest disappointment with this game was its production. Almost all columns are of slightly different heights! Naturally, this gives some players an advantage over the others. In my copy, the green pieces are several millimeters shorter than the others.

One of the worst dexterity games I've ever played and certainly one of the worst SdJ winners.  Villa Paletti did nothing to advance the genre of dexterity games, which I admit is a hard one to truly innovate in, but when you make a stacking game that is 100 times worse than Jenga, you don't really deserve the recognition.  The fact that it looks like modern art from the 1960s is the only reason I rate it higher than a '2'. It's boring and predictable.  Should have been quickly forgotten. No idea how this one is even rated in the '1000s'.  Either the column that is being removed is 100% no problem or it is the one that knocks over the tower. No risks; no gambles; no anything. The die might seal the deal without you even trying. And for a half-sheet of rules, how are there so many ambiguities and holes?! Just terrible.

Immediately reminds me of Jenga.  The English translation we used for the first game had us all thinking there was something missing, and since checking the Rules forum it's clear there was.  We need to play this game again.

Instant Classic. At first you think... "this is easy... nothing to it, just a dexterity game". Then you start discovering the hidden depths of the strategy - grouping of columns, forcing other people to move columns, leaving blocks behind, steering the next layer placement by anticipating who will lay it, etc, etc.

However always best played with wine or beer. A great introductory game when the  alcohol is flowing. Although we found that Absinthe meant we could never actually get as far as scoring before some idiot made the tower collapse.

We call it "Jenga Pro" - dexterity and a HUGE slab of strategy once you have played a couple of games.

As a game, it's not so great.  The rules are clunky and awkward, and the way that victory is determined isn't entirely convincing.  But really this is not a serious game.  It's more of an activity, and no one cares who wins - you just want to make sure you're not the tower-toppling loser!  It makes for a decent change of pace, and would probably be a good choice for a mixed group of kids and adults.

Disappointed with production quality. Some of the columns are obviously shorter than the others. Means that the majority of your turns will simply be to seek out the shorter columns and remove them.

Also the first and second level are tedious. You have to pull and place 15-20 columns before there is ANY tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't like having to make up house rules, as such this game has no rule on what to do if, for any reason some pieces fall over (and possibly off the "pallet"). Rules say the game is over when it collapses but nothing about individual columns falling over.

Ok, so I was one of those Puerto Rico fan boys who couldn't believe the SdJ went to some Jenga-esque game that I'd never heard of.  Well, I can see exactly why it won the award: this game has broad appeal, it's fun and it feels like a gamer's Jenga.  My only complaint is that the rules could be a little more fleshed out.  It seems there could be a few things balanced little better... (no pun intended)... but in the end, who cares? It's a riot to play.

This is by far my favorite dexterity game -- there is an implicit learning about center of gravity with this game which can be put to use in most devious ways. The game is also fun when everyone cooperates and decides to build a building that *might* actually stand tall. The scoring mechanic, although imperfect for single plays, works well across multiple, tallied plays (although, I'm more of 'Jenga' type 'scoring' for single plays; i.e., one loser and everyone else wins).

This delightful family game can be played by kids and adults alike.  It ends in a creshendo of crashing parts, squealing, and laughing.  The construction itself is colorful and fun.  The play has educational aspects of balancing as well as the need for a certain amount of dexterity.  

The only lowlights on the game are the need to use a translation sheet for the rules, slight warpage of some of the floors, and explaining the score block.  (The block is counter intuitive, but quickly makes sense.)  

As an aside, only once have I played a game where the top (red) level had pillars on it!  This is a game classic, and family classic!

This is a great, little dexterity game that most won't admit to liking.  There's actually a good bit of strategy and planning - at least more than meets the eye.

If you've got a group of non-gamers, alcohol, family, or a mix thereof, this a reasonably safe bet for a rollicking good time.

An uncontested-skill game where those with the requisite skills will enjoy it, and those without won't. That being said, Stacking games are less skill-intensive and therefore more accessible than flicking games. The game is 10x the game Jenga is, simply by the addition of having to consider center of gravity and counterweight. Once you get past the rules ambiguities and the dull first round, the tension ramps up pretty quickly after the green level has been placed.

After 1 play.

Don't like it.  There is a lot of holes in the rules.  Flow of the game is somewhat 'quirky'.  It's supposed to be fun, but it wasn't for me [not that I don't like this type of games - I have some fun with Jenga for example].  But the BIGGEST problem is that the winner is decided in most cases quite RANDOMLY.

Generally it seems a nice idea, but it is not rounded up properly.  I'm surpprised it has won Spiel des Jahres award.

RATING: 7
Where was this game when I was a kid? As it is now a pretty fun party game, not too much thinking but a little and damn fun and guaranteed to get peoples attention.

Probably better than Hamsterrolle which I also played but about the same and way better than Jenga! 

This lends itself to team play easier which is why I picked this one over the other. It is definitely fun to watch or play and would be a great ice-breaker in a semi-big group (8 or less).

Good dexterity game, and visually impressive. The scoring is a bit strange, but it forces you think about which pieces you should be moving on your very first turn, which is a plus. The minus is that you could get screwed very early in the game as well. Still, it is fun to pull the pillars and watch the tower grow, which is really the point.

RATING: 6
With 2 players it plays very quick, with 4 it takes more time because everybody is looking for the best move. The need to win this game is not as strong as in other games, because building a nice tower also gives satisfaction. Overall it provides many tense moments and laughter when it finally collapses. Very suitable to end a night of games! (04 aug 05 after 8 plays)

Janga, with strategy. Building up is a neat twist, and creates a much more competitive game. Unfortunately, the rules aren't meant for a truly competitive game with lots of holes and gaps, but it's still a lot of fun as either a lighter game or some 'clarifications'.

Can't believe this won the Spiel des Jares (Game of the Year) award. [b]I used to play this with my wood blocks when I was 2 years old. I didn't need rules to know how to play this![/b]

Ludicrous how group-think can overtake anything from politics to movies, even the hobby of boardgames. So sad...

Hands down, Puerto Rico should have won that year.

I guess after reading the rules it's not so bad. At least there is some thinking about how to place a platform. I'd have to try this game to give it a fair rating. In the meantime, 3 will suffice.

Fantastic dexterity game. There's even a certain amount of strategy involved (e.g. which pillar to take so that the weight is on another player) which is absent is most other dexterity games.

The tension and fun factor is really high. My only concern is that because the pieces collapse from quite high up, over time, they might take damage from hitting the floor repeatedly.

Acquired in 2003. Only played once in 2006. Total number of plays = 18. Doesn't see all that much play because after a while folks just put things at edges causing the house to fall much too early in the game. Still I think it's a more interesting twist to Jenga because of the irregularly shaped floors which makes you think of the support distribution both underneath and on top of a floor.

Great fun for adults. It's like jenga but the other way around, and definitely more fun. A wonderful party game, but can be also tense if you're playing it with the right group of people.

I love the fact that it's not that hard, so I can play it quite competively with my 3-years daughters. My kids like it enough to never refuse a game when I ask them to play, but rarely suggest playing it on their own. I believe it's a similar case to Sorry! Slider, which is also a lot of fun, but looses with Gulo Gulo and Tier auf Tier due to the abstract (at least for kids) theme. Anyhow this game is so versatile I would recommend it for families with kids of any age.

Like Jenga with modern art.  I can tell that the green pieces on average are a bit longer than the others. Kind of detracts from the game knowing this.  Otherwise it is fun. Neat to see the weird shape the tower takes as it is built.  Hard to see where the center of gravity is.

I really enjoy this dexterity game as you seek to discover the center of gravity and make life miserable for the other players in attempting to get their pieces out.

This looked like a nice, almost strategic version of [thing=2452][/thing].  However, it was hampered by two things:  first, there is a lot confusion over the rules and the version that we got had several different rulesets.  It was difficult to find the original rules (i.e., the rules that won the Spiel des Jahres)---however, we managed to find some version of it here.  By assigning point values and colors to each player, it felt like there was quite a bit of strategy added to the game (e.g., whose column should I move and where should I move it to).

Secondly, unfortunately, she really, really, really dislikes dexterity games.  As a result, I could barely tempt her to try this.  To be fair, I think that most dexterity games are a lot more fun with more people so that everyone can get into it, so this is unlikely to be a good two player game anyway.

Loved this little game.  I say "little" when it's actually massive.  But this is a light stacking dexterity game that's very visually appealing and easy to teach and play.  We played it a lot at the convention between playing heavier things; it's a good way to give your brain a rest.

Modern classic of stacking games, next step from Jenga. It has terrible rulebook (truly bad, never seen a SdJ winner with such a mess of a rulebook) but it's easy enough to make your own variants. Fun for all ages! With heavy heart I'm lowering the rating, because newer stacking games have surpassed it. It's still great for its simplicity, but rarely gets played because we have Animal Upon Animal and Riff Raff. I like playing this one with my 2-year-old son though, the components are sturdy.

2-Player Comment:
* Like most stacking games, Villa Paletti works very well with two.

edit: Ultimately I relegated this to my sons collection, with adults I'd rather play something like Riff Raff for dexterity.

It took me several plays using the University Games rules and the German rules to decide what I think about the game overall.  I prefer the German rules because the scoring is much easier to track, which seems in keeping with the lightness of the game.  It's a lot of fun.  There is quite a bit of strategy in where and when you place your columns to make things difficult for others and easier for yourself.  And it just looks cool.

A very simple "Jenga-like" dexterity game, that is great for a change of pace.  You don't really need to play with the scoring rules, but just go at it, and see who makes the construction fall.  The main source on amusement is the chatter and jeers between the players.  The placement of things can be delightfully strategic for those who want to have a dose of that, but it's mostly all about the stacking-and-crashing. Probably the only game where production flaws of the playing pieces are "game features," but I wish at least the baseboard sat completely flat.

RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: A dexterity similar to, although much more dynamic, Jenga where you move your columns up to the top platform without disrupting the balance. When no other columns can be moved up, add a new platform and keep going.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Easy to get into, exciting, spans well for players of all ages, and will probably have everyone on the edge of their seats (as well as all on-lookers drawn in). Scales surprisingly well with three or four players.

Cons: The way of deciding a winner feels out of control and ultimately not very important (feels a little better in this aspect with 3 players rather then 4). The pieces certainly aren't built perfect. And finally, it sucks to feel ripped off when one person gets a little ambitious early on in the game and ends it before the the game even gets going.

Other: There's nothing like a balancing act to add tension, and this game has that in Aces. And while I'm sure it'll still get played enough, the flaws keep this in a category below other great dexterity games. Lately we've been playing in rounds with an accumulating score to help deal with the poor single game way of deciding the winner as given in the rules.

Best Use: An easy, on the edge of your seat game when the ultimate excitement is more important then a winner.

Simple game, yet great fun. Much better and more tactical than Jenga. I just like the ways the tower defies the laws of physics. This is one of the games where I really don't mind who won - what the players achieved together is much more important. Of course, somebody is a loser in the end...

Very good game for children, especially as a two-player game with an adult and a child.

A fun game, but hurt by the fact that when one player screws up, the game is over, and the winner is unsatisfyingly determined (frequently) by who went last.  Bausack / Sac Noir is a much better option because when one person tumbles, the rest of the game is still viable for everyone else.

Dexterity game that can be played with kids.

You place all the columns on the first level and add the first floor roof. Then you take columns and add them to higher floors, adding roofs as you go.

If you can't pull something out, you say so and if the next player can, you are out. If they knock it over, you win.

There is also a little hook you can use to extract a column more easily... maybe.

A more "interesting" and carfted version of Jenga. Can be played quickly with children and may become quite tactical with adults where careful positioning of pieces directly above those of oppoinents stops the lower ones being easily removed.

Incredibly suspenseful stacking game. I've given it away because I am an average to below average stacker and the people I play with are amazing stackers and I always end up ruining the tower with my terrible moves when I know they could have built a bit taller had I not been playing.

Game of the Year?!?! I happen to enjoy dexterity games. They're not my favorites, but I can appreciate Bandu, Saturn, and Bambaleo just fine. This game, however, has none of the fun of these others. There aren't enough options to make it interesting and the scoring system is horrible. The quality is poor, too, as the boards are made of some kind of wood that will warp if you look at it funny. I guess if this didn't win the SdJ, I would be less emphatic in my feelings towards it, but it's a slap in the face to all the designers that made entertaining games that year to lose out to this nonsense.

RATING: 1
A game for which no one seems to know the correct rules?! Rules in different editions contradict each other, confusing players even more. Worst thing is, these are not just minor points in the rules but things like scoring or which colour to remove, etc. that have huge impact on gameplay. If I were the designer I would at least care as much to publish the intended set of rules here on the Geek to clear up the widespread confusion... Traded away my copy as soon as I got it.

Hilarious, thrilling and rather replayable dexterity game with beautiful, sturdy wood components where players strive to build a monument with rather irregular shape and have to lift the columns of the early levels to build up the next ones. 

To this Jenga-like principle Villa Paletti adds up tactical choices: players choose where to place their pillars until they agree that no more pillars can be placed without letting the structure fall, then the following player chooses as well where to put the next plateau (possibly leaving pillars uncovered) and after the second plateau players strive for scoring the most points bringing their thickest (or the most) pillars to the top.

My favourite dexterity game. Once you have a few layers I love the judgement calls on fulcrum points down the stack. I like the push-your-luck element on the decisions on where to place columns.

The family has had good fun with this over the years, but it’s only ever been a now and then type of game . As more columns come out, you eventually get to the point where the floor is left standing on just 3 or even 2 columns. At the point where everyone agrees that no column could possibly come out without everything toppling, add on the next floor and proceed ever higher. Up to about 6 floors high, each floor smaller in size ... after which you place columns end to end on top of columns!

The columns are subtly different lengths, so by placing columns on the edges of the floors above, you may shift the floor to be leaning more on different columns underneath, freeing up a previously load-bearing column. That’s as far as strategy goes. To win, when it tumbles, you need to have had the most points in columns (there are three different thicknesses worth 1 to 3) on the previous floor and not actually cause the Villa to crash down yourself.

The game seems to draw you in, more like a cooperative venture than anything, to see how wild a villa you can build, pushing the edges of balance. Gathering your own coloured columns seems de rigeur in an attempt to be the Master Builder. But the point of the game isn't really about winning or losing … it’s all about the fun of the build.

Dexterity game along the lines of Jenga but much more interesting, with plenty of chances to out-think others as well as the physical skills required.

RATING: 6
Interesting in a physics kind of way, in how to tip platforms in order to slide out your pillars from underneath, as these are of variable lengths. As pillars are also of variable worth when on the top platform, indicating who is winning, means that pillar placement has to be considered to prevent someone trapping yours when the next platform is placed. As the tower gets higher, its amazing how it holds together. Really is a spectator affair with more than 2 players as you wait for your turn, hoping your opponent topples the lot.

RATING: 8
Great dexterity game that works well with all player counts.  I feel that the two player game allows for a better sense of "how high can you go" play than with more people.  I still like Strong Stuff better than this one though.  That game plays with more and is more intense than this one.

Quite enjoyable dexterity game. There are even some tactical decisions, as placing your pillar very near to an opponents one (such that he cannot get this away better), removing a certain pillar such that there is more weight on another pillar, and in general the decision to build stable or rather fragile. However, the rules for who is the winner are not really balanced and the game should more be seen as a funny experience, in which you try to make moves harder for other players.

Exciting tower-building game that has added some tactical spice to the old mechanics of games like this. Despite all the fun this one offers, it is losing its challenge after some games.

(Well, maybe this game was created for children, so i shouldn't complain.)

The rules, as written, seem to make this game less fun that it should be. When played as written, the weakest player is always the one placing the new level. We need to figure out exactly what house rules we're going to play by and stick to them.

I didn't like this much. Unlike similar games such as CrackeD ICE and Tier auf Tier, you feel some ownership of your pieces in this one, so you don't want the thingo to collapse. Good play is not rewarded, which is a shame.

Have a lot of fun playing this with my kids - they're age 2 to 6. More as an activity than a game as such, but the turn-taking and the fact that we work together doing it are good game-playing characteristics that Villa Paletti develops. Very good component quality.

I have the Jumbo version with the better box art. (at least, I think better box art, I'm not a fan of how the Wiggles version looks...)

Vila Paletti is just plain fun. It's tense, it's easy to get into, and there is real strategy when placing pieces and deciding which ones to pull out.  I'm waiting for the day we get beyond the Red floor...

Although I'm not very fond of dexterity games (mostly because I've always been somewhat of a spaz my whole life), I really dig Villa Paletti.  Yes, it's Jenga.  But, that's something of an oversimplification.  Here's the best way to describe it.  You know how people try to describe euros to nongamers as "they're like Risk or Monopoly, but they're fun to play?"  Well, if you understand that statement, then Villa Paletti is like Jenga, but it's fun to play.

Villa Paletti -- 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seemed fun, now only to figure out how to play it. 
Yeah, there's rules and there's rules and them aren't the same rules and none of them make sense. 

But, the premise is intriguing. 

It's a stacking game that's not a stacking game, it's neither a Jenga-like game. It's actually a buildign game, a game of architecture, engineering, static forces, balance, and one-upmanship. And the whole thing looks stunningly like something Le Corbusier would build (if he was starting his career in 1960s). There's manoeuvring, there's lateral thinking, there's guessing, there's physics and elbowing. 

Neat so far, would love to figure out what the rules are. And play again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Villa Paletti is a spectacular game to look at but it is far from a gripping competition. Like other balancing games it is full of hold-your-breath moments. 
There really is little strategy or scoring, though, at all until the very end. As such it is a fine game for those that do not need competition.
As your building reaches crazy heights you know you are close to your big moment: the fall. I find that everybody is keen to not knock it over but nobody cares who wins.
It is a slight step up from Blockhead both as a game and as a spectacle.

Lovely looking dexterity game in the Jenga vein (albeit with a more complex scoring system). Each player is trying to make sure they can continue to layout columns in their colour on the next level. VPs are given for columns of different sizes. Most VPs wins.

Lots of ways to hose players by deciding where to place your column and which column to pull out first. Some holes in rules but easily houseruled. Looks fantastic as the tower grows.

Currently my favorite pure dexterity game, although the original Make n' Break is pretty entertaining.  (Micro Mutants is also good, but not a pure dexterity game, IMO).  I love columns and so I just enjoy seeing level upon level of columns being built.  This reminds me of the towers I would build when I was a kid, so it taps into that feeling for me.  Upon further play, may move up to an 8.

UPDATE: Have played this more and just love seeing those columns go up.  Moving up to an 8.

A challenching dexterity game, that is somewhat flawed by the rule that determines the winner. There really isn't a winner, just one loser. I prefer the solution made in Tier auf Tier.

I finally got to pull this out for a few rounds of 4-player action.  I was SURPRISED how much fun this was.  It's definately the sequel to Jenga, with some new interesting mechanics.  I got this to play with my son, but I dont think he'll be able to play this at 2 yrs old, maybe when he's 5 or 6:  it requires a steady hand, some dexterity, and there are actually some interesting decisions to be made.

I wasn't so sure about this game at first, but it was really cheap at Tuesday Morning so I picked it up.  Finally got around to playing it and had a blast!  This game is very different from anything I have ever played.  It combines dexterity with strategy in a way that actually works instead of feeling like the strategy element is just "tacked on."  Everybody gets very involved in the game (even observers) and there is lots of great tension as the tower gets higher and higher.  Simply put this game reminded me of what it was like playing games when I was a kid.  I strongly recommend you try it.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I have played it only once myself but have officiated a few games that my kids have played.  I knew what the game was, but I guess was hoping for something a little better.  In fairness the kids have enjoyed it well, who knows maybe it will grow on me and after trying it more times my opinion could go up.  For such a simple game they have done a poor job of have good clear rules.  Conflicting rule sets/versions.. lack of clarity on exactly what defines a "collapse" or how to start the game so it is "fair" for all colors at the start.

RATING: 6
[University Games 2000 Edition] {Builder; Jenga-variant; optimal 3-4p} A novel dexterity game with spatial strategy. It has good player interaction and replay value.

VP is suitable for both gamer or family A family can play it as an advanced Jenga. Gamers can play it as a solid filler by adding strategies. Different from traditional dexterity games, where accuracy and balance are the primary factors, VP is more focused on the spatial strategies and players have to plan ahead to maximize their points in the upper levels. Thus, players may have agonizing decisions at some turns. Even though it is nice and unique, I felt strange that it beats PR in the Game of Year 2002 award.

The bits are colorful and sturdy though it's not color-blind friendly. Remember to find a flat and stable base to play the game. I don't prefer playing it on a table because someone may accidentally kick the table and the falling parts may damage the table. 

Two minor drawbacks of University Games Edition: the quality of bits is not as nice as other editions and the rule is not as complete as the edition of Zoch.

C’era una volta tra le verdi colline Toscane uno strambo giovanotto chiamato Paletti. Aveva un chiodo fisso: terminare la costruzione della villa iniziata dallo stravagante nonno e mai completata per mancanza di ducati. Ovviamente, anche Paletti non aveva abbastanza ducati ma ideò un metodo geniale per proseguire il lavoro: perché acquistare altre colonne visto che al pian terreno ce ne sono così tante da essere inutili? Le smonteremo e le risistemeremo per sostenere i piani più alti. Tutti gli operai gridarono “Evviva Paletti” e iniziarono immediatamente il lavoro. Così nacque un’audace costruzione: VILLA PALETTI!

Grazie ai recenti scavi sono tornate alla luce le geniali architetture di Villa Paletti, ora accessibili a tutti. Grandi e piccoli, giovani e anziani, funambolici architetti e ingegneri incompresi potranno cimentarsi con le incongruenze architettoniche del folle palazzo, assaporando così la gioia di costruire davvero un castello in aria.

La semlipicità e la velocità del gioco e l’ottima qualità dei materiali hanno portato Villa Paletti alla ribalta, vincendo lo Spiel des Jahers 2002.

Elenco elementi di gioco:
1 Base
5 Piani in legno (5 forme differenti)
20 Colonne in legno (3 forme differenti)
1 Uncino
1 Dado speciale
1 Libretto delle regole

It suffers from the same thing as many dexterity games - more rules than are needed to make it a game rather than a pastime.

The scoring cube is faintly ridiculous and a lot of the time people didn't even bother with it only to wonder how we scored when the tower came tumbling down.

Let's be clear; the rules aren't complicated, they're just more complicated than we want when we're playing a dexterity game. Still nothing matches Animal upon Animal in this category.

As far as the "building tall structures" dex games go, I like Bausack better because you have your own structure.

This one try's to avoid delaring the last person to touch the structure without making it fall over the winner by assigning points to the pillars and keeping track of how many points you have on the top layer. If you are looking for a dex game that has a winner, I don't think this one works. 

Also, we played with four players and the same person kept placing the floors. Maybe we were suppose to remove some pieces from play, but it was causing problems. That person could place the floor so that none of his pieces could be made to support the floor. As far as I know I can't lift the floor up with two hands and re-position it, so it's a huge advantage.

A fun game which is limited by the fact that when in a situation to play it (4 players, whimsical mood, etc.) it doesn't seem to hit the table.  If I see it when in that situation, I'll usually suggest it, and it's fun.  One issue - sometimes the parts sort of "warp".  I've had complaints about that, but I simply say it's part of building the Villa Paletti.  That usually is accepted.  After all, it's not a serious game, it's meant to have everyone screaming "Aaaaaaah!" when it finally begins to topple.  And topple it will.

Mein tollstes eBay Erlebnis hatte ich mit Villa Paletti. Ich habs für 4,50€ bei eBay ersteigert, mit Versand hats neun gekostet und als ich es dann ausgepackt habe lagen 15€ drin. Kein Mensch weiß warum, ich habe auch nicht nachgefragt. Wahrscheinlich einfach vergessen. somit habe ich für das Spiel effektiv sechs Euro bekommen. Allein deswegen gefällt es mir schon. 
Das Spiel an sich ist eigentlich auch sehr nett, lediglich der Wertungsmechnismus ist blöd und wirkt aufgesetzt und hat dazu geführt, dass ich das Spiel noch nicht häufiger rausgeholt habe, obwohl ich eigentlich ein großer Fan von Geschicklichkeitsspielen bin. Wobei man das Spiel auch einfach so spielen kann, dass derjenige verloren hat, der die Villa zum Einstürzen bringt. Ich denke, ich werde es demnächst wohl mal wieder rauskramen. Geschicklichkeitsspiele sind immer gute Absacker zum Ende, für ein Hauptspiel fehlt ihnen immer etwas die spielerische Tiefe. Bausack und Elchfest passen acuh ganz gut in diese Kategorie, ich denke Pitchcar wird demnächst noch folgen.

I love this stacking game. So many times the structure topples when you remove a piece rather than place a piece. Gravity is nuts, right? The scoring is a little weak, but it's present enough to make this a real tense game as well as a fun-time activity. Four players or teams is a must.

SEEMS really interesting and fun, but the rules are rather cryptic.  Scratch that...the rules are obscene.  I have to try again with BGG's translations, but until then, this game gets a 6 assuming you're playing with the included first edition rules.

I really like dexterity games.  Given how uncoordinated I am this really suprises me.  Anyway this is a unique twist on the dexterity theme.  Basically everyone gets 4 pillars.  The trick is to take your pillars from below a platter and put it on top of the next platter.  If you're too timid to do this you can start a new platter.  The person with the most points on the highest platter when the tower collapses wins.

If you are playing with a newer version...PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE ORIGINAL GERMAN RULES.  The game is a totally different (and better) with the old rule set.

Villa Paletti is a great stacking game.  A combination of strategy in judging the stack, judging your opponents ability to stack, and your own skill in removing pieces makes this a very deep dex game.

Infinitely better than Jenga and not as bulky as Bausack. The hook mechanism is fun but be careful not to take an eye out with it. We must not be very good at it though because we have never made it to the top platform.

I found this a very fun dexterity game with a pleasing aesthetic- certainly a stronger option than Jenga for this reason, plus the game feels more varied.. UPDATE: OWNED

RATING: 5
So, what happens when you can't move a piece at all without running the risk of knocking down the tower?  And with 2 players, is there even a point to keeping score?  I think this is a neat idea, but I think there are better multiplayer dexterity games that assign points to determine a winner.

Simple stacking game where you build a tower with columns and floors. The columns are different colours and you roll a multicoloured die to determine which column you must move up a level next.

I rate this 5 for adults, but for my 3 year old I would rate it an 9, he loves it and I love playing it with him.

Exciting fun.. tower gets very pretty as it gets taller and your heart drops when the tower collapses.. abit of tactics in placing floors, as well as placing coloumns to make it difficult for other players.. girls play this game particularly well so if they have a hard time grasping other games, play this one!

Superb dexterity game. Wonderful with children, too. Just make sure your first floor neighbors went out for the night.

RATING: 7
it's a fun dexterity game with obscure rules to understand what you should do, who is the winner, who can start another floor, what happens if just one pillar falls and so on. Just play it without rules, without winners and just try not to be the one who drops everything

This requires steady hands and some craftiness. There is some replayability since positions differ from game to game, offering new challenges.

There is no better description than "Jenga for gamers" but that "for gamers" part is really neat.  Trying to put your self in position to win by getting your color pillars to the top while no knocking the whole thing down is really interesting and more fun than it has any right to be... and everyone likes to play with the hook!  Easily my favorite stacking dexterity game.

A colourful, quirky, stacking game, with scoring, and a cube mechanism. But is it better than Jenga!?

There are rules for pillars which either may 'eventually' become immovable, or are discarded.

The tower can also be finished, rather than keep playing until total collapse. This is where the scoring comes in.

The English rules (see files section) are pretty badly translated. They Leave out a lot of the key rules of the game. Especially with regards to omitting the fact that you are only allowed to move pieces of your own colour.

Ok dextery game but nothing great. Like most dextery games it misses a good mechanism to determine the winner. Nice to look at but after some plays gets quite boring. I prefer Jenga because it's faster and more intuitive.

A nice building game. Not very heavy but ideal for some situations (with some beer etc.) If you like Jenga, you'll like this too.

RATING: 6
A cute stacking game that is a little imprecise in its execution (the pillars aren't all the same size, the scoring system is weak), but as long as everyone understands it's just a party game and is in the right mood, fun will ensue.

Easy to teach and a good alternative to Jenga.

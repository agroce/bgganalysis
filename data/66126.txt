This is my favorite of the Mystery Rummy titles, alongside Jack the Ripper. Love the Action deck used here to spice up the game, and the scoring is really smooth and simple, unless you were the one who went out in the round, you just score what is beneath your Foiled card. TONS of flavor text here, probably the most in the series, and I also find the card design the most attractive. Good game, Mike Fitzgerald, always reliable.

Another respectable entry in the Mystery Rummy Series of games, but I don't often feel inclined to play these games.  I like the limitation on playing melds (# of prisoners in the yard).  I also like the tension and semi-cooperative nature of scoring... melds/layoffs need to be scored during the round or else they're worth zero.  I'm not sure that I like that you're required to play a prisoner in order to score a color because it feels like the deck is a little light on prisoners and the "event" cards aren't very good at digging prisoners from the draw deck.  In fact, I'm not sure I like the event deck mechanism at all relative to the gavel cards mixed into the main deck of earlier Mystery Rummy games.  Being able to hold onto a gavel (action) card to play at an opportune time is much more enjoyable and strategic than hoping for a good flop card from the MR:Alcatraz random event deck.

I love the Mystery Rummy series and Mystery Rummy: Escape from Alcatraz was no disappointment. All the entries in the series are slightly different but they all are based upon general Rummy mechanics. In this version you play as the prison guards of Alcatraz, collecting information on escape attempts and busting the suspects before they make their attempt. Of all the Mystery Rummy games that I've played, this one plays the best with more then 2 players.

I thought the randomness of the action cards might be a little too much of a luck factor, but it's not - it turns out to be a good way to encourage people to get cards into play, rather than holding them in their hand to try to go out suddenly.  Definitely a worthy addition to the Mystery Rummy series - I hope there are more coming!

As always, the historical details on the cards add a fascinating element.  They're irrelevant to the game play, but candy to a history geek like me.  :-)

Jack the Ripper is best with two players.
The difference between JtR and the others, is there is a guessing element to the game. At one point, you may make a gamble on who is Jack - if you are correct you get points.
That is nowhere else in the MR games.
Jekyll and Hyde - is strictly a two player game.
Rue Morgue - is good with partners
Al Capone - is Canasta-like
Bonnie and Clyde - is umm... not the best in the series.
Escape from Alcatraz - can be a bit more complicated and confusing.

An interesting take on the Mystery Rummy games. It is interesting to have the number of colors to the number of convicts in the yard.

I have all the other Mystery Rummy games and Wyatt Earp, Bonnie & Clyde and History's Mysteries. This was a must get.

The next game in the Mystery Rummy line.  Thematically I think we are wardens trying to prevent escapes off Alcatraz Island, but it all felt a bit nebulous.  You meld escape methods onto the table, allowing others to lay off.  When the 8th card of a meld/layoff hits the table, the escape is foiled and you bank those points, possibly adding a high scoring mastermind to the stash.  Players are encouraged to meld/lay off, as each occurrence awards a powerful action card, but you sort of want to hold cards back to lay down the 8th card as a power play.  Certainly not that complex, apart from the different terminology for the various decks, and ultimately will get lost in the mix of other Mystery Rummy titles.  Jack the Ripper is still by far my most favoured option.

RATING: 5
My least favorite Mystery Rummy so far!  It is quite a bit simpler than the others, as there are fewer and bigger sets to track.   What left a sour taste in my mouth were the action cards.   Whenever you play a card (or cards), then you flip an action card which has some random ability that can totally hurt (or help) any strategy you had in mind for playing out your hand.   I also disliked that many of your cards melded have a high chance of not scoring anything at all.   Makes it feel a bit pointless.

Another great Mystery Rummy title from Mike Fitzgerald - the newest addition to the series.

See my pictorial review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1696819

This is a more casual entry in the series, due to a separate Action deck, which takes away hand management and adds more luck.  This makes it more fun for non-gamers, while gamers will likely prefer other titles in the series.

Best with 3 players (just as Wyatt Earp is).

This started as an [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4307197#4307197]entry[/url] by Andrew Korson in a [thread=438467]"themed rummy" design competition[/thread] to be judged by Fitzgerald. "Escape from Alcatraz did not win," says Korson, "placing fifth overall, but Mike liked it enough to ask me to collaborate with him, with the intent of creating the next Mystery Rummy game. We worked on it in 2010/2011, resulting in U.S. Games agreeing to publish it." The game was finally published years later.

We had fun with it in a four-player setting. Good dilemmas and clean play.

Interesting note that has nothing to do with the quality of the game. The conceit is that the players are guards who FOIL escape plans, but if the Foiled card had just been changed to read ESCAPED, the conceit could have been reversed 180 degrees. And this would have fit better the game's title.

* Kickstarted! *

Fifth and best of the series so far, this time: the discard is a visible stack, the number of melds is limited to escapees (which give bonuses to the person who gets to 8 cards or more), only completed sets count for points (no negatives) and -- most importantly -- there are special actions that take place after each meld is played/enhanced that affect game play in a good way. Quite enjoyable.

PLUS: easy to learn, use of history, balanced
MINUS: you can see when someone's getting uncatchably ahead
BONUS MINUS: the Kickstarter-only play mat isn't effective or useful (not to mention doesn't fit right in the box)

RATING: 8.8
Escape from Alcatraz is the first game I've played from the Mystery Rummy series.  If the others are even half as interesting as this, I think I'm in for some good times ahead once I crack in to the others.  This one though turns rummy from a sort of boring, theme-less card collection game into something with a little meat on its bones.  Add to that the action cards along with how sets are scored, you've got a winner.

Rummy game where you are trying to foil the plans of in mates in Alcatraz to escape.  You try and get 8 cards played to score. The last person playing the eighth card gets the inmate card.  There are a number of special cards that are played each round.  

I really liked the game. I did find that if we were playing right solitary became absolutely massive and there were a lot of cards out there.   At times it seemed hard to score colors because of this.  But I like the mystery rummy games and this was a fun one.

I like this new mystery rummy game.  It has some nice tweaks on the others, such as a separate action deck.  It has a nice balance between melding and holding back.  Playing plan cards after the plan has been foiled, however, does seem strange thematically.  A minor quibble.

RATING: 5
This was a pretty disappointing entry in the Mystery Rummy series, for me. I like the theme of escaping from Alcatraz, but the game felt like the training wheels version of this system. Basically whenever you play a meld or a convict, which you need to have at least as many of as there are different melded types, you draw a card from the event deck. I love event decks in games, but here it just felt like a lazy way to incorporate Gavel Cards. In the past, you had to carefully utilize Gavel Cards along with making melds. Here, it's like they throw you a random Gavel Card whenever you make a play. Couple this with the fact that it's very easy for someone to empty out their hand, despite what the rules would have you believe, and making it so it shuts out your opponent from scoring can lead to a very one-sided game.

This might be better with more players, but if I want a lighter game in this series, I'll stick with Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld. That feels like the best entry point into the series, unless I'm playing with only two, and then I'd go with Jekyll and Hyde. This one just felt a little too on-rails for me.

Initial rating w/ 2 players.  Revised 11/19/2015: I still love this game.  My 6 y.o. learned how to play it recently and now I am having a blast playing it with him.  The game does suffer at the end of a round when people are just waiting for the right cards to go out, but this seems to be an issue with rummy as a mechanic in general.  If you play with 4, this issue might resolve quicker.  Not sure.

The Mystery Rummy series are always playable and this one is quite easy. Loved the theme - but would have preferred to be escaping rather than foiling plans. My game went too long for a rummy game and the discard deck is not utilised enough. I liked the action deck. 

Overall, playing to 100 is too long if it makes the game go three rounds or more. Wyatt Earp still the best in the series.

1 play, 4er

The latest in the series, this one seems more Rummy and less Mystery. That is, most of the cards are just suited cards you're trying to collect -- basic rummy (draw either 2 from the deck or 1 from the discards -- which are splayed; then play cards if you like; then discard). The changes here:
- Gone are the powerful gavel cards. Instead, there's an Action deck that is triggered when any cards are melded (max once per player turn).
- The total number of suits melded may not exceed the number of escapees in the Yard. Escapees are this game's version of the gavel: play at most one/turn, into a common display. The deck has one of each suit, plus 5 generic grays. 
- You can foil one escape plan (= score a meld) on your turn if there are 8+ cards of that suit on the table (all players' displays): put your melded cards, plus an escapee (from the Yard OR your hand), into your score pile. Other players may also immediately score their melds of that color, and may add their own escapee from their HAND. The escapees may be either gray (5VP), or the scored suit (10VP). 
- If you go out, you get bonus 3VP/escapee in the Yard (or, if NO plans have been foiled this hand, score their full value instead). Everyone scores  for their foiled plans. Play continues until someone gets to 100+ points ==> most points wins!

Not my favorite version! In fact, it seemed to drag a bit. I didn't really like the action deck, which seemed more random and "take that-y" than usual; nor the fact that the hand could end so quickly, before you could play melds (let alone foil them to actually make the melds worthwhile!) -- wasn't fun being 4th player in a hand! 

Need to try it with 2 or 3 players; probably better than 4?

Took a chance and picked this up for $7 shipped from Amazon.

The gameplay seems decent, but there is a huge element of luck. There are "event" cards that you can get, and they can either help enormously or be of no benefit at all depending on what you draw.

The whole aspect of playing cards and hoping to trigger a scoring phase that will benefit you more than the other players is good. But the event cards make up a big part of the game and they detract from the good parts.

RATING: 4
Action cards add too much luck.  You basically don't know when or if you can go out on your turn.  This element alone adds a huge element of luck to a game - Rummy - that is already full of luck.  After Al Capone I consider this one of the worst mystery Rummy games.  Prefer Wyatt Earp, Jekyl and Hyde, or Bonnie and Clyde over this. Haven't played Jack the Ripper yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a nice addition to the Mystery Rummy series, which is a good thing considering how bad Bonnie & Clyde was.  The game returns some decision making to the game, and gives you a number of tactics to use when making melds.  I like that the action cards are a separate deck, since it incentivizes players to play down melds when the game itself is designed for you to hold onto cards so as not to give your opponents an opportunity to finish the melds to foil the escapes.  I'm not bored with it yet after two plays, so I think that's a good sign.

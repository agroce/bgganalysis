Very similar to Favor of the Pharaoh, but a little more going on under the hood. Resource acquisition is important, and needs to be actively planned out multiple turns in advance if you don't want to be at the mercy of the die rolls. The art is nice but the theme is entirely pasted on. I would definitely recommend playing with attack cards and defense cards to get the player interaction it needs to really hum.

Das Thema ist aufgesetzt, tatsächlich handelt es sich um ein abstraktes Spiel. Die Rohstoffe haben zwar Namen, die braucht man aber nicht kennen, denn sie werden durch Würfelzahlen 1-6 dargestellt. So braucht man denn zum Erwerb einer Karte auch nicht die Rohstoffe XYZ, sondern Würfel mit bestimmten Zahlenkombinationen. Die Karten haben Namen, die braucht man aber nicht kennen, denn die Funktion einer Karte ist durch Symbole gekennzeichnet. So braucht man etwa zum Erwerb einer Karte, die eine Ressource = Würfelzahl produziert, Würfel mit bestimmten Zahlen. Flair und Thema hat das schlicht null. Davon abgesehen funktioniert das Spiel aber recht ordentlich, so dass man es durchaus spielen kann, wenn man dazu in der Stimmung ist, ein "thematisches" Spiel ganz ohne Thema zu spielen. Wirklich schade; das Thema ist so interessant, aber das Spiel trägt dazu gar nichts bei.

To Court The King is given a grimey, post-apocalyptic, industrial re-skin.  The dice accretion and manipulation are almost exactly the same.  The end is different; whereas To Court builds to a climax in which everyone tries to outdo their opponents in a final rollout, Colony is about a gradual build up of victory points.  Colony offers the greater variation from play to play by only using a fraction of its set of card types each game.  

I think that Colony has two problems.  The first is that many of the cards are pretty dull; a dice, a victory point, an incremental step forward.  Second, To Court is tightly focused; it is a race up the scale of cards and the initial roll of most of your dice tends to point in a clear direction.  Colony allows you to save a large set of dice from turn to turn and then add a large set of temporarily available dice at fixed values.  It presents many options of similar, incremental value.  Turns can be painfully slow.  So, Colony is dull and slow and I have no wish to play it again.

Bezier never wastes much money on artwork.  I suppose the industrial drab here fits the theme and the mood the game induces.  Production quality is good.

Seemed a little too snow-ball-y for my tastes.  Dice give more dice, which is the natural way of things, but a lucky roll early can just one player out of reach.  Might need to play this one again to see if that was just an outlier.

Card drafting dice game that feels a lot like Dominion, although a closer look reveals that the games are really not that similar. I can appreciate that the mechanics are trying to cut down the randomness introduced by a bunch of dice, but they also cut off a chunk of excitement usually associated with these kind of games. More of a thinking man's dice game than a light dice chucker.

Looked good after reading : kind of Dominion with dice. But I'm very disappointed : the cards to buy are expensive and different in cost, so mostly you don't have a lot of choice which card to buy. Time between turns is very long so I find it also boring. Maybe with another set of cards I will give this a chance again later but I'm not sure.

(2-4 players, 60 min) A clever game of dice manipulation. The nanopocalypse left the world in ruins, entire cities reduced to rubble by rogue nanites. As a colony of survivors, you must scavenge for materials to rebuild your society and protect yourself from thieves wanting to take your valuables. Do you dare try to harness the unpredictable nanite technology to get ahead?

Sort of a tableau-building game with dice resources. Feels a lot like many other Euro games that are coming out in the 20-teens with dice rolling and special powered cards in a tableau. It is interesting and there are certainly options to have a different experience each game, but it didn't get me excited about the game. I'd play it again, but won't seek it out.

Having played Age of Craft, I will say that I don't think this one is as good, however I still think its a fun game.  The stable / unstable mechanism is a neat addition, but I miss the "push your luck" busting aspect the original had.  I really like the graphic design on this one as well, but I do think some of the stream lining that was done to the game hurt it a bit.  I think this one probably works better as a 2p game than Age of craft, so I do think this might be a keeper, but lets see how I feel after a few more plays.

Colony was one of the big hyped games of 2016. Its basically a colony building games with variable resources represented by two different kinds of dice. Overall has a very similar feel to most deck building games. Not a bad game, but in my opinion the suggested first play setup doesn't do a very good job of illustrating the strengths of the game. This is one I'm hoping gets better on subsequent plays, I should enjoy it...

I'm usually a huge fan of engine building games, but this one is super bland. I felt much the same about it as I felt playing Artifacts, Inc as the games are really similar, except Artifacts, Inc seemed to have a tad more personality. You built up some pretty uninteresting abilities to generate more dice and do things, and repeated until someone reached the point threshold.

The problem with engine building games that take the approach of Colony is that you feel at some point you're just autopiloting down the trajectory you've chosen. You've built your engine, and now it's time to see if that engine gets the job done in less turns than another player's engine. This, in contrast to an engine building game like Terraforming Mars, where you continually shift gears, reacting to things that are thrown at you, which provides a much more interesting engine-building experience.

There's also no sense of accomplishment here, or anything present that makes any one strategy feel interestingly different from any other strategy. Everything works fine mechanically, and there are different paths to take, but it's sterile as heck with nothing to add any interest or excitement. Now, there are plenty of thematically bland games that I love as well, but those games all do something very original or interesting mechanically. This one is dull on both counts, with both the mechanisms and theme failing to engage.

Overall, I suppose I'd play if someone else really wanted to try it, as it plays quickly and is harmless, but that's about it.

Purchased after seeing Rhado run through this.  It looked so good.  The production value isn't the best, and it would have been nice to have put some theming on the dice, but I get why it is more practical to just make everything numbers.  The game plays easier this way, but I wanted to feel more like I was in some post apocalyptic landscape, similar to how I feel playing Arctic Scavengers, but this fell short of that.  And, as is typical for a tableau builder, once you feel you have built up a nice little engine the game ends.  That was cool to have that feeling of frustration that you have nothing and want to build it up. I want to play this more, and continue to keep the attack cards out of it.  I want to make the most out of this purchase.

Stockpile seems OP.
Apparently we were playing it wrong.  You don't earn the VP every turn but rather once at the end of the game so the max you can earn from the standard storehouse of 6 spaces is 3 VP.

Decent Game.
Plays similarly to Machi Koro or Dominion.
Uses dice rolls to determine what you can do on a given turn. Personally I prefer
Dominion's mechanic of drawing from an ever growing pool of cards.
Not a bad game by any stretch. Tons of replayability
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Simple (dice-) pool-building card game which reminds me of dominion. But in compare to dominion, I didn't like this game and I wouldn't recommend it. The problem of the game is, that it feels completely random, because the best planed "engine" to earn victory points only works when you have luck in your (and other players) dice roles. So when you play this game on a high strategy level, the dice roles decides at least the winner.

Additionally, the AP is high in this game, because you cannot really plan your turn during other players turns because of a lack of information (which dice i will get).

pros:
- nice dice drafting
- good component quality
- nice artwork
- replay-ability

cons:
- randomness
- paced on theme
- uninteresting decisions
- high AP
- no really strategic depth

A bit of smart dicing, which to this gamer brings back fond memories of Queen Games' simple [i]Airships[/i]... more or less sent to the poorhouse for the boring aspect of needing to collect lots of dice before you can do anything interesting at all. And the subsequent realisation that there isn't actually all that much interesting stuff to choose from in the first place. Different cards may alleviate this, of course, but purchasing a game to play with but a subset of its cards sounds like a terrible waste to me. Perhaps I ought to revisit Tom Lehmann's Ciúb.

You are the leader of a struggling post-apocalyptic settlement, where you will scavenge goods necessary to create structures necessary for the reemergence of mankind, such as GMO farms, tech labs, and, um.... Investment banks?  Sure, why not.

Interesting Mechanic: Colony is a dice drafting game unlike most others. You will roll three dice on your turn, take one and pass the other two to your left.  That player will take a die, and the next person will take a die as well.  Each die represents a different kind of good (for example, a '2' represents fabric and a '6' represents Uranium'.  Sadly, this isn't strongly reinforced).  You then can spend dice to upgrade or build buildings, each of which can be used once per turn to allow you to roll and manipulate more dice.  However, the dice drafting game is the interesting thing, as you need to balance your own needs with the need to not give your opponents goods that are too favorable.

Colony is a pretty good game by Bezier games, who will reappear later on this list.  My biggest disappointment is that the dice themselves are boring and could have been significantly upgraded as component pieces.

A lot like Dominion with dice, for a few different reasons.  There's a shared card market that's picked from a larger selection of cards.  Everyone starts with the same dice engine and can slowly improve it to buy better cards. There can be little-to-no player interaction depending on which cards are picked and what people buy; the dice drafting was likely intended to make you pay more attention to what your opponents were doing, but very rarely does it actually matter.  The bottom line is essentially the same as Dominion's- players race to see who can build the fastest VP engine, with the main luck factor being rolling dice rather than drawing cards.  I'm interested to see if the game gets any expansions, because while base Dominion is a solid game, it got way more interesting after a few expansions.

RATING: 6
Resource conversion the dice game.  I think the theme of developing a nice productive Colony actually comes through with all the dice manipulation and planning.  I'm still early into my opinion on this one and that could swing up or down as I get more experience.  The game really rides on twisting your brain around those dice and all the ways you can possibly manipulate them to fit your strategy.  

On the flip side of that though, for whatever reason, I've found it really easy not to care when playing this game.  There are certainly strategic paths to go down when playing, but I've found that the game doesn't really engage me enough to care.  Some games just suck me in and never let go until it's over - Agricola, Suburbia, Tzolkin.   In the realm of dice games, Machi Koro, Race for the Galaxy, and Kingsburg all manage to hold my attention longer than Colony, which is odd because I like the dice mechanics of Colony more, but not the game that's built around them.  

I really have to make an effort to get into Colony, and while the dice drafting, conversion, manipulation is intriguing; I generally fade out about halfway through the game.  The game eventually just becomes a sea of pip conversion, and I just get tired of looking at all the dots.

Rereading my comment, I can't help but think that these are the thoughts of someone spoiled by their own hobby.  "It's easy not to care....I really have to make an effort to get into Colony."  It just reads like I'm looking for excuses to damn the game.  The truth is I've played the game eight times in the last month - more than any other game I own, and my wife really seems to like it, so I imagine it's going to get played a lot more.   Sitting back and enjoying games with my wife is at the top of my list when it comes to activities I love, so anything that makes that happen more often doesn't deserve to suffer my shallow critique.  I rated it a 6, but it might as well be a 10.

I love the idea of the dice mechanics for resources. I also like how this game does not require shuffling. There are some really interesting questions in this game about how you value VPs and card abilities in the race to the finish.

What a waste of my game time! This game has a lot of issues.
It suffers from severe down time. When it's not your turn you can't really think a head because the dice can change before it's your turn again.
All you do is roll dice hope your lucky (you can't really push your luck here) buy cards for dice that earn you victory points.
Each card has some special ability that you can utilize on your turn.
Although it's about a destroyed earth somewhere in the future I didn't even once felt the colony theme. The theme is of zero importance.
The art work is far from beautiful or inspiring not to say it's boring or at times (I'm refering to the robot) childish.

Sounded good, but the reality fell flat.
AP-fest, with too much downtime between turns that can't be spent productively. Game develops too slowly, and takes noticeably too long for what it is.
This would likely improve a bit with experience, but getting through that holds little appeal.
Also, cheaped out on the dice; nowhere near enough for the theoretical max, and I could easily see running short even in a "normal" game. :/

Initial Rating: 6.5 (December 2016)

For some  reason, I thought Colony was a game in the same vein as Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig (perhaps because the name that suggests more real estate, but in a grander scale :D), as such, my desire to play it was low. But I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that the game was much closer to Dominion than to those games. Colony is the reimplementation of a game I never heard before (Age of Craft) and is very reminiscent of Dominion but with dice. I enjoyed the game but not enough to keep a copy in my game collection.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 12 minutes. Gameplay can be slow with 4 players, I think it is best with 3 fast players or with 2 players. Playtime is around 60 minutes but I think it can be reduced a lot with more experience.

Thar art is ok as are the game´s components. The graphic design is clear and clean, it helps a lot to teach the game.

The theme is cool, but you don’t feel it through the game, other than in the name of the cards.

Colony has a light-medium weight. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t complex at all. I enjoy that you have to give dice to your opponents in your turn, this decision is a lot of fun and non-trivial, but it also lends itself to AP as you try to analyze the plans of your opponents. 

You roll your dice on your turn and then decide the best way to spend them. There is a healthy dose of luck with the game (I won because I rolled a 6 and I was behind the leaders all the game), but there are ways to mitigate it. For once, you can buy and upgrade certain cards that give you dice, also you can storage dice so you can plan ahead. I’m not sure if the luck factor brothers me or not, I need to play more times to verify this point. If the game is long the luck factor begins to really annoy me, but if the game is short, I don’t mind much.

Colony is an strategic game because it has an static market offering, due to this, the game is just to all players, a huge positive for me. Also, in each game you will play with a different set of cards (a la Dominion) so the replayability factor seems very high.

In our game it seemed at first that there was some runaway leader problems, but at the end the player who was behind was the winner (due to luck). I’m not sure if there is a runaway leader issue. I also need more plays to verify this point.

I dislike that the game ends immediately when a player reaches the required VPs, that is, the players have different amount of turns in the game and that’s unfair! A huge minus for me. It seems that the first players have an advantage.

Bottom line, Colony is very close to being a good game for me, but it is very similar to Dominion in many regards, and I love Dominion, so when I was playing Colony I actually wanted to play Dominion. Due to this, I sold my copy of the game. I’m also worried about the luck level of the game and that may lead to runaway leaders problems. Colony is an ok game for me and I´m open to play it anytime if requested.

Colony is a dice game similar to [thing=21632]To Court the King[/thing], or the more recent [thing=171011]Favor of the Pharaoh[/thing]. There are piles of cards on the table, drawn from a larger set of cards to add variety. Each pile has multiple cards of the same type and each can be bought with a certain dice combination. The required combinations are explicit lists of numbers such as 5-5-5-2 or 6-2-2. 

On your turn you roll three dice, keep one and pass the other two to your left neighbor who keeps one and passes the last one to their left neighbor. You then get to activate cards you own which may give you dice or allow other abilities. The goal is to draft more cards or upgrade (flip over) ones you have. Either of these things will give you points. Once someone has a certain number of points the game ends at the end of that round.

[b]Engine building[/b]
This game is all about getting some early cards together that will give you more dice or more options. Which will allow you to get some more cards to get more dice to get more cards....

How well you do is therefore sensitive to your early rolls when you lack much in the way of dice and abilities. This would be the perfect recipe for run away leaders except for a strong rubber banding rule which gives those in last place a chance to catch up.

This aspect of the game worked well. The dice drafting was fun, and the game remained relatively tight to the end. The ending condition is not something I'm a huge fan of, but it works well here.

[b]Specific requirements[/b]
Something about the very specific requirements on the cards bothered me. It meant that it was difficult to remain flexible when collecting dice. In games like To Court the King you need to get pairs, straights, or reach some total number of pips which allows you to be more flexible. It's not an entirely fair comparison, Colony allows you to save dice between turns (at least some of the dice) which can help you build towards something. That notwithstanding it seemed I was a little too vulnerable to the vagaries of the dice when trying to buy certain cards.

On the whole I found the game fun. It's on the lighter side and plays in about an hour without overstaying it's welcome. However, it didn't wow me in anyway.

Colony aka Dominion - the dice game. Nothing I have waited for. Also, I don't like its other inspirations such as [gameid=21632] and its successor [gameid=171011] published by Bezier last year.

I just don't get how rolling dice to purchase cards granting special abilities can be a good principle to build a game upon. Getting lucky early and be able to buy powerful cards will start a snowball that is difficult to stop. My one and probably only play of Colony even managed to worsen things by featuring the crazy mechanism of getting 40% of the required VPs with the purchase of a single card and lucky dice rolls. I'm talking about the prize chest that in the base version lets you roll three dice and keep the lowest roll as VP, in the upgraded version it will be the highest roll.

The positive reception of Colony indicates that enough players love snowball games. I don't.

Four player games have way too much down time. This may not be long for my collection. 

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I much prefer the original Japanese game this game was based and developed from as this feels too streamlined - feels too much like Favor of the Pharaoh with Dominion while the original did not (at least to me). The concept of stable and unstable dice is an interesting touch not in the original.

RATING: 7
I appreciate the open decision space Colony allows for in creating one’s colony - much like creating one’s kingdom in Dominion which this game readily resembles. The inclusion of dice to roll and manipulate in taking actions each turn is a novel mechanic as is the sharing of dice rolls among players each turn.

Some cards seem more useful or favorable than others and therefore many cards may see very little play. The roll of the dice won’t always provide for the desired outcome, though the game does provide many ways to mitigate poor rolls.

This Dominion-like game utilizes dice to take actions in activating, improving and gaining cards to further build up one's colony. It plays quickly and mostly as a solitaire experience for each player except that resources are shared each turn and there is the ability to attack one another. I enjoyed the game, but I would like to see how the additional cards included in the game affect play.

RATING: 5
I'm always interested in a new dice game, but cautiously so, since what I like in them is a very narrow band of what they usually offer. Colony appealed to me when I first heard about it, as there was mention of a tableau building element, which I also like, but then got comparisons to To Court the King and that made my expectations plummet. I wanted to try it out and see which elements won out.

We played with the "Mass Production" card set, so we didn't have interaction cards, so I can't comment on that. I can comment that while I didn't mind the game and it's not as terrible as To Court the King, it's also not particularly special either. There's a limited amount of dice-jiggling, and mostly you have to deal with what you roll, which I like, but what you're doing isn't particularly interesting or thematic.

An enjoyable dice drafting and tableau building game, though with a graphical design that is maybe a bit bland for my taste. It has a good balance of strategy and luck, as you can choose to focus on building up an engine, by grabbing production buildings, or take your chance on the dice by grabbing special buildings that may or may not grant you enough points.

Nettes Würfel Spiel mit viel Varianz und daher vermutlich recht hohem Wiederspielreiz. Hat nach der ersten Partie einen guten Eindruck hinterlassen.

A nice tableau-builder semi-deck-builder dice drafter.
Not super good though, quite luck-dependant still.

Definitely runaway-leader prone.
Too many negatively interactive cards.
Also it seems impossible to skip the basic resource generating cards which is very sad. It's like forcing the player to buy a couple of Silvers/Gold before buying action cards in Dominion.

Not sure if it's a keeper. Depends on expansions.

A dice-roller that has some advantages of Machi Koro, Favor of the Pharaoh, etc., in the slight dice drafting and more interesting card play. Where this game really fails is the complexity of card costs. It's difficult to plan ahead and even see what is within your "budget" as you manipulate your dice because the costs vary in such arbitrary ways. This is not specifically a play problem so much as it is a slowing. I'm curious about the other cards in the box, having only played the base setup, but this is probably best at 2p due to downtime.

I like dice drafting and I like Colony... it borrows things from other games like Dominion an Machi Koro and improves on them.

The only thing I don't like about the game is the rule that allows the player to discard one of his buildings to get extra dice equal to the difference in points to the first player... really don't like that rule and everyone that I played with also didn't like it

Colony is a dice-drafting game where players use dice to purchase and activate building cards. Each game, there is a semi-random selection of buildings available, a little like Dominion. Buildings have a variety of functions, like adding dice, dice manipulation, and storing dice from turn to turn, as well as being worth victory points. When a player reaches a certain point threshold, the game is over and that player wins. Like Dominion, a big part of the enjoyment of the game is analyzing the available cards and coming up with a strategy. I thought it was pretty fun.

Lately I've checked out three different tableau-building, dice-rolling designs; Machi Koro, Dice City and now Colony as well. Among those titles Colony is by far the game I applaud and appreciate the most. Interestingly enough, it also share resemblance with Dominion; the engine building characteristics, the sub set of available cards to buy, the possibility to choose confrontational play or not, heck, even the box insert looks the same. But I would actually advocate Colony over Vaccarino's deck-building classic. The reason behind this favorable comparison to Dominion is twofold, one: rolling dice is way more satisfactory than shuffling cards and two: I much rather experience how my own engine and my opponents' materialize and come to life visibly than trying to memorize what's even in my deck while having no clue whatsoever about the content of my opponents'.

Really nice Dice manipulation game that falls in line with Machi Koro and Favor of the Pharaoh. I actually like this better than both of those games. It is a card builder using the mechanic of drafting dice. you can upgrade you cards for better effects or buy new ones using the dice you have in your storage from the drafting. Lots of cool features and a ton of cards to use for set up so there is a lot of replay here. Very enjoyable and I know it will be a HUGE hit!

RATING: 5
Pros:
1. Dice - I love dice and this game has a lot of them.
2. Engine Building - This game you are using dice to purchase buildings that score you points, allow you to manipulate dice, or take different actions. You can build some great engines.
3. Dice Drafting - I love the mechanic of rolling all the dice then drafting each one.
4. High roll is not important - 6's are no more or less important than 1's. The important value is the value you build around in your engine.

Cons:
1. Boring - I found this game to be boring. I was never on the edge of my seat. I was never getting extremely excited about the engine I was building. 
2. Minor - Everything in this game is just minor improvements. Buildings only allow you to do small things. It's very slow and small incremental improvements.
3. Ends Quickly - The incremental improvements in the engine means by the time you feel like you have a great engine ready to go off, the game ends.

Summary: The game is going after the same feel as Dominion except with dice. The problem is that the cards in Dominion feel powerful. Every time you get a card you can't wait for it to come through your deck. In this game, you get yourself a building and it doesn't really do much, and it's usually situational which means you can only sometimes use it. You're just never excited. I'd stick with Dominion rather than buying this game.

I couldn't tell if I would like this game based on the description/rules and watching a few videos about it.  I could see myself enjoying it...but I could also see myself thinking "meh".  I wanted to try-before-buy.

I tried...didn't buy.  The dice drafting is a little clunky - people were dropping the dice left and right as they were passing it around.  This was a little frustrating.

The engine building didn't feel that satisfying - not nearly as much as I thought it could.  I'm not sure why this part missed the mark.  It's very much like Dominion (which I love) in the way you build the market, but this game just didn't connect for me the way I expected.

The overwhelming positive is the variability in this game.  Each game can play out soooo differently because of the variation of the market (like Dominion) and the roll of the dice.

The dice rolling in this game didn't turn me off, like it does in most games (I'm NOT a fan of luck-based games).  There were enough options to mitigate the dice rolls.  It's more dice placement than dice rolling (if that makes sense).

Ultimately, the game just felt very bland, left me wishing it had more and grateful I didn't buy-before-try.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this game but I feel like the pacing is off. The build up works well, until it reaches a tipping point. Once a player has the right combination of stuff they just take off to the end of the game. What makes this problematic is that often the difference can be that one player gets a "2" first and then pulls away. The reason for this is that since the dice are static a player can get the right combination of dice and then just buy the highest point yield buildings each turn. The game does provide a way to stop this, which means messing with each other's dice is really a must. I have not played with four, but I am worried that this means the game has a bit of a gang up on the leader issue.

Credit for a dice game that does not have anything around a re-roll. But tired game in general, akin to Machi Koro + a few bells and whistles like dice drafting and variable setup, but in the end, why not just play a deckbuilding game.

Colony is solid. It's not super flashy or thematically crunchy, despite the cool space western art. It's just a solid, solid game that deserves your attention.

Neat dice manipulation game. It's sort of like To Court the King: roll dice, acquire cards with certain combinations, score VP. But it's different enough -- save dice, manipulate in different ways, and a bunch of little tweaks --making it a bit more of a euro style resource management, engine building game. Turns are harder, though, since there seems to be more to consider after every roll.

Really has some balancing issues. Fun idea but awkward execution. In other alspach games there is better "market regulation" mechanics. This one seems to lack that and can lead to a very repetitive and frustrating outcome. Might try removing some of the fallout shelter cards to fix this.....

I like the design, but the game is just too casually light. There are also some wonky elements that just don't sit well with me. It feels like I'm playing by rote. Game is pricey for what you get, too. 

Not too bad, but really nothing more than an unappetizing appetizer.

tl;dr: like [thing=171011][/thing], but different

I didn't play the original version of this game, but when I played the Bezier edition, it reminded me quite a bit of [thing=171011][/thing]. You are using dice to roll results to get cards that improve your options. I've always liked [thing=21632][/thing] a lot. I quite liked Favor of the Pharaoh but didn't feel the need to own both. The added variety is nice, but not enough to get me to fork out that money again. This game is a bit different, but it does scratch mostly the same itch for me. And while I wouldn't mind owning this game, I need to play it again to know if I find this different enough. But it certainly is a solid game.

Only played it once (3 p) and that usually isn't enough to judge a game. But I really didn't like this one, so I won't be giving it another go. The mechanic of rolling 3 dice at the start of your turn, picking one and passing the other dice to your opponents to pick one is really clever, I liked that. But the rest of the game just didn't appeal to me. Felt like yatzee with cards added.

RATING: 4
Roll dice, buy cards, much like To Court the King, but with a variable setup following Dominion. With a dozen active card types, no strong pattern to bring order out of chaos, and all cards being accessibly from the start, Colony promotes extreme down time (4p). In To Court the King, the more powerful cards needed more dice, so it was easy (except for the dark art) to work down from the most powerful cards to what you could actually get. Colony has no such filter and dice are passed around seemingly just to increase complexity. The score track is (from one play) a useless disruption since you can easily count points: graphic design is very clear on that point, but poor on the distinction between re-rolling and choosing a number.

RATING: 6
Solid game with a solid engine-building core. The dice add variability and chance, which is a welcome addition to a genre that is typically built on near absolute but soulless control (I'm thinking of Splendor here). Of course Colony is also a take on a type of deck- or tableau-building game ala Dominion. You have no deck of cards, but the interactions are just as complex. My major concern is, because the game's complexity builds quickly, downtime is an issue. With two players, you feel the downtime, but it's manageable -- and yet you miss out on some of the multi-player trading feature. With more players I imagine the downtime would grind the game to an agonizing pace.

Colony is an excellent dice collection game with frequent, easy choices... but the execution is cold, cold, cold.  The stark theme of a post-apocalyptic wasteland was a disastrous choice to hand to an artist.  With so much action in the [white or gray] dice, these cards fade into the tabletop.  It's hardly more evocative than black-and-white typed cards.  Colony is an otherwise brilliant design that demands a colorful re-imagining in a future edition.

I gave colony a 6. The game play was alright with the base game. Somewhat exciting the first 2 or 3 times you play it but you'll find quickly that the card variations get repetitive after say about 10 games. Product quality is fine. My absolute favourite thing about this game however (which has nothing to do with playing at all) is the vacuum mould insert. Simply one of the best inserts I have seen for any game. I was other manufacturers would mimic the box insert ingenuity of this game.

Colony is a dice game where players are racing to X points (where x depends on player count). Every turn you roll three dice and draft one of them. You can store some dice (though not "unstable" dice) or spend them to do things. The most common thing is to buy a card that gives you some ability (either more dice on your turn or an ability to do something with the dice). Cards are generally worth a point or two.

It's not the deepest game, but it's quick fun with dice. I like that the cards are used dominion-style where you can change which cards are in play for any given game.

Played at BGG Con 2016

The Colony is a bit of a mixed bag.  It has great mechanics that flows really well and is easy to understand but playing it is a nightmare.  The games has three large flaws that ultimately bring it down: [i]1)[/i] you're essentially managing six resources, [i]2)[/i] no real choices, and [i]3)[/i] near zero player interaction.

[b]The Good[/b]
The Colony is most similar to a deck builder and has a Dominion-like feel but you're not building a deck, you're managing a dice pool.  The idea is simple-- you roll so many dice per turn, keep their die value, spend those dice, and bank the ones you don't want to use.  Buying cards is simple-- look at the dice on the top of the card and match those dice.  

Buying cards each get you points and each player is trying to accrue so many points.  It's really simple, easy to understand, and flows really well.

[b]But Then You Realize the Game has Six Resources...[/b]
Where the game fails is trying to keep all these dice straight in your head.  On your turn you'll know you'll need a 5, 5, 5, 3, and a 3 but you may have 4, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1, and a 1 showing.  You then have to figure out how to convert that dice pool into your desired pool.  This means doing things like turning the two ones into a 3, turning the two 4's into a 6, and then turning those two 6's into a five.  It's really a nightmare to keep track in your head.  It may sound interesting but I promise you, it is not, especially when you factor in the fact other players are sitting bored watching you try to figure things out in your head.

Even worse, you don't really know your final dice pool until your turn making it near impossible to plan ahead.  And then you get to your turn and it's a headache because you're trying to figure out to manuever the dice into what you want.

[b]No Choices[/b]
In other deck builders, you have four money and have a wide variety of choices because you have one currency.  Even in something like Ascension that has multiple resources, you still have choices.  In The Colony, you have the dice you have and then one thing you can really buy.  You don't really have interesting decisions.  I know this may sound conflicting with what I said above in trying to change the dice to get what you want, but you still really don't have choices in this game.  

[b]Near Zero Player Interaction[/b]
Finally, like a lot of deck builders, this game does not have good player interaction.  You take your turn, and you're done.  Yes, you'll get passed dice but since you don't know your final dice pool until your turn you can't really plan ahead.  You essentially just take the one that matches what's in your bank or the highest value.  It's mindless.

There are attack cards in the game, but they are pretty pointless if there's a Chain Link Fence available [i](and there should be one available if you have attack cards)[/i].  We played with pirates in our setup which can either steal a dice of opponents choice, steal a dice of your choice, get you two free sixes, or just outright kill themselves losing you the points they would have given you.  The random nature of that card means you cannot plan, you just roll a dice and hope you don't roll a 1.

You can upgrade the pirates so that rolling a 1 doesn't make them kill themselves, but that is pretty pointless because of the Chain Link Fence.  The Chain Link Fence is an easily bought card that once bought says that when any player attacks you, you roll a dice.  On a 4-6 the attack just fails.  That means when I attack with my pirate, if I roll a 1, I lose my card and points, if you roll a 4-6 the attack just fails.  This means there is a large chance those pirates you spent all those dice on are going to be worthless.  In something like Dominion the player at least has to have the Moat in hand, in The Colony, the Chain Link Fence is always there.

To make things worse, the Chain Link Fence can be upgraded so that attacks fails on a 2-6, which destroys all motivation for me to get attack cards.  At its base, the Chain Link Fence is powerful enough to make me never want to attack and then it's upgraded verion just makes all attacking not worthwhile, resulting in players never really talking to each other, they're just lost in their own dice pools.  at least in something like Mystic Vale, I'm setting up my next turn while the other players are going, in The Colony, I'm just watching them struggle with how to manipulate their dice in their head.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
The Colony is frustrating.  I love deck builders and I love dice games, but The Colony just isn't fun to play.  It's impossible to plan ahead or have any sort of strategy, you're stuck doing nothing when it's not your turn, and for such a simple game the act of converting dice to what you want them to be is such a pain that it's a major turn off.  If you're a casual player, you'll hate this game because converting dice is a chore.  If you're a more strategical player, you'll hate this game because there's no real strategy because it's really all random and the player interaction is rendered pointless due to a single overpowered card.

Don't waste your time with The Colony.

Think Dice City meets Dominion, only not as good as either one. I thought I would like it much more than I did. The gameplay is slow and tedious. The art is bad and the theme nonexistent. The rule book was great and one of the few redeeming features. Also the insert is good.  Luck plays such a huge part in there's little way to mitigate that. Swing and a miss for me.

I liked the original Age of Craft, so I was predisposed to like this version as well. It does make some interesting changes. I think my favorite thing about the game is the insert, which not only keeps all the components well organized, it fits the cards even after they are in sleeves. More games should learn from this example! I also appreciate the free randomization app that is available even for my Kindle Fire.

Well it 'works'..... But there is no fun in playing. There are other games that have a lot of downtime while you wait for you round and that are still enjoyable. There is no connection to the story or theme, just the card names and even if I enjoy dice games very much (which I do) I didn't enjoyed that one. It get's a 3 because the mechanic is working but I won't suggest it to friends.

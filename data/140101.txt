RATING: 4
2 plays, 4 players.

liked: stunning artwork. liked the theme. liked how fighting wasn't over-the-top.
disliked: the ships felt fiddly, difficult to read. lots of downtime. too much randomness.

I felt the higher point tiles were too difficult for what they were worth. the person who won did lots of lower point tiles.

It's not bad, but I feel like it lacks too much impact for me to actually like it. It boils down to some very simple tile laying and resource collection with just a hint of screw your neighbor via fighting. It's okay.

Love the solid, varied game play and multiple paths to VPs. Love the components, except the player boards are a tad too small. Being a Euro-sort-of design, I'm pre-disposed to dropping it a grade as I find euros, by definition, to be all similar to each other. This game, while superb within its own genre, still "feels the same" as a lot of other Euros I've played or own. Thusly its hard to give it a high rating.  If it played with innovative or seldom-used mechanics, and still remained a strong game then my rating would be higher.

The game took a good amount of time to play, but with 2 players it makes me wonder how it would scale with more, during a lunch hour.  We enjoyed the game and I liked that there were a few paths to victory.  I got lucky with a couple of card draws that gave me some developments at the beginning of the game, that helped me throughout.  I was very unlucky on my tile draws.. so it all evened itself out.  We didn't fight too much, although that is definitely a way to play, and possibly win the game.  I really enjoyed the exploring and the almost terraforming feel of the game.  I would like to come back to this one.

Unless I was playing wrong, I can't possibly see how this game could come in at 60 minutes. It is way too long for what you get out of it. 40 points (the end-game condition) is a lot to get in this game, especially if other people are correctly trying to sabotage your plans through blasts and attacks. I can see this game getting longer (!) as you gain experience and people figure out how to play better defense. 

The luck and chaos are out of control, and I am someone who typically doesn't mind those elements in games. Terrain draws are bad enough, but pulling the development cards is horrible. Some are impossible to build on the current board, and some are already satisfied or one move away from completion. The die rolls for resources are feast or famine. Then the chaos of trying to plan to complete your card, and other people are blasting terrain. I won the game I played and it was still an exercise in total frustration.  

Cool concept and artwork and everything, but as a game it blows.

If it wasn't for a few game balance issues this game would score higher for me.  It might not be perfect but it is definitely fun and has a good theme,  A fun little map building game in which the map is actively being created or 'discovered' as the game goes along.  Also, it's always fun trying to blast your friends down in a sky pirate battle of zeppelins.

RATING: 6.5
In my opinion, this game is great, but it's one I need to be in the mood for.  There's a tendency for new players to simply sit back and gather resources, but once people realize how important it is to attack others, the game begins to take on a life of its own.

While downtime is an issue for some people and the game can drag on if the table is populated by AP-prone players, if you play with a chatty group, it's not that noticeable and really, you're at best waiting 2-4 minutes per player.  Meh.

Since this isn't a full-on review, I will just take a moment to say that Gamelyn does not disappoint with its components once again - the meeples are awesome, the artwork is awesome.

Some balancing would benefit the game, but ultimately, I want an air pirate expansion!

Dice rolls for resource collection and damage are particularly frustrating because they have all the input randomness that is so maligned by Euro gamers while the game continues to lack much in the way of player interaction.

The tech cards are also wildly unbalanced and based upon whether or not they are collected and in what combination vastly changes the game for the worse.

Comment after a video review:

This is the kind of game where mechanics makes no sense with the theme.

The ship management mechanic is very interesting. You place worker around your ship to do stuff which thematically makes senses.

But trying to match pattern by building a map, seriously! that makes no sense at all. All the objectives to gain VP also seems pretty dull.

I think they should have made an adventure and exploration game where you make quest, do trading, visit shops for upgrades, etc.

In fact the exploration of america theme like found in "Uncharted waters" or in "Pirates and marauders" could have been used in this game.

In Fantasy Frontier players control Zeppelin-type airships that fly around the world in an attempt to find resources, use them to build settlements, and generally score points.

It is a worker placement game.  A flawed worker placement game at that.  Each Zeppelin has some special power.  The special power will make your Zeppelin a little better at fighting other Zeppelins, or at moving, etc.  Each player also gets a crew of five to use.  So, on a player's turn they are going to assign their five crew to various stations on their Zeppelin, which is depicted on individual player boards.  They may also interact with the ever growing world (as more of it is explored).  The world is created by drawing hex tiles from a bag, and placing them out into the centre of the table.  Then the active player takes the actions they selected and play moves to the next person.  But because you do everything on your turn from placing your workers to taking the actions, the workers really aren't necessary.  You might just as well say the 5 things your going to do and be done.  It would make much more sense, as a worker placement, if all players place their workers secretly behind a screen first, then simultaneously reveal, then do their actions in turn order.  I mean, in real life I wouldn't know what other crews are doing on other ships, nor would they know what was going on in my ship.  However, the way the game works is I see what another player is going to do, I see them do it, then I can adjust my strategy as needed.  

Another thing that just doesn't sit right with me is one of the major ways of scoring.  One of the actions you can take is to research.  When you do that you take research cards.  Most of these cards show a pattern of terrain types.  If you can manipulate the board to have this matching pattern (or if this pattern just happens to come up) then you score points equal to the number shown on the card.  Why?  I don't get it.  It just seems thrown in.  There's enough going on in Fantasy Frontier already.  You have to discover the world, find resources, turn those resources into cities, fight off your opponents...and make patterns in the topography?  Maybe just me, but it doesn't sit right.

After saying all that I wouldn't call Fantasy Frontier terrible.  There are some neat ideas here.  Flying a Zeppelin around the ever expanding world is cool.  Sending your workers down on "away missions" is fun too.  I can't recommend purchasing the game however.  Play it, sure, but let someone else buy it.

Had a wonderfully enjoyable time playing this and looking forward to getting the rest of my gaming group addicted to this game. Just the right amount of strategy and luck for my tastes. The end does come a bit fast so may consider raising the winning victory point condition from 40 to 50 or allowing all players to play one last round when the first player hits the 40-point goal. Then highest point total wins. Already kicking myself that I didn't buy a second copy when I kickstarted since I'm already coming up with custom content for my group. :)

RATING: 6.5
The airship game pieces are too big for the tiles.  Either the tiles need to be bigger or the airship smaller.

The game is heavily weighted towards the luck of the roll.  A good player can lose due to a bad run of dice rolling where they just do not get enough resources. Conversely, a mediocre player can win if they are lucky enough to getting 2 resources for one roll or high numbers during combat.

What is good: the artwork

What is bad: 
1) lots of AP (= downtime) as everybody has to puzzle to find a matching pattern
2) The airships are too big or in fact the tiles too small, which make they block a part of the map, which makes it even harder to find a matching pattern
3) The winner will be for 95% decided by pure luck (right dice roll, right tiles, already laid out patterns)
4) Why does an American publisher always have to include a combat-system? If you to make a Eurostylish-game DON'T include combat!!!
5) no fun or excitement while playing

这个游戏的名字，不留神的话很容易看成是最终幻想啊。其实是完全无关的两个游戏哦。游戏的美工相当不错，画风和游戏的主题很合，和最终幻想也有不少异曲同工之处呢。
这个游戏有2个主机制，工人放置和板块拼接，2种机制整合得还算是不错的。每位玩家面前的飞船面板就是工人施展拳脚的舞台啦。
作为一款糅合了多种机制的中策游戏，这游戏和同类游戏相比，在美工和机制上都有些亮眼之处，价格也很适中，有兴趣的话可以研究一下规则，招来玩玩看哦。推荐！

Illustrative of the problems with Kickstarter games where the mechanics aren't subjected to rigorous disinterested play-testing. There are some mechanics to affect another player, but these can be undone by that player at less expense than it cost to do them in the first place. This makes any attacks on another player to be a waste of everyone's time. That leave a multi-player solitaire game where the mechanics are essentially: play a patter, or find a pattern already in place. It's calculation, but it's not really fun.

I enjoyed this game. I'm not 100% convinced that the special power each person starts with is balanced enough, but we'll see. Also, the wooden airship tokens are too big for the game. You can't see what's happening on the board very well. We're using spare Zeppelins from a Moderne Zeiten game.

Not bad, but it doesn't do a lot for me. The cards don't seem too well balanced. More importantly, it seems likely to follow the too-frequent pattern seen in target point value games where a player is close to winning and everyone leaves it to the player on their right to attack them. This game DOES have the bright idea of awarding points for successful attacks, so it's not as bad as it could be, but the other players are likely getting more points per turn than one can get from attacking. I also just find this dynamic boring.

The game has a lot going on. An interesting twist on role selection, exploration, pattern recognition, points from battle, and ship customization. It's a beautiful little puzzle that becomes an interesting struggle as players become more familiar with its premise. I'm liking it.

Borders on being a Weuro. Eurogame mechanics but there's an element of conflict and fighting with your airship. The ships have asymmetric abilities so you need to play to your strengths. This takes it somewhat away from your standard Euro but still an interesting game of resource collection and area pairing for points.

RATING: N/A
Competing Zeppelin Captains race across the land to explore, develop and, if necessary, engage in airship combat. Each ship and crew have unique special abilities. Worker placement for area control and to place hex tiles in terrain patterns that match secret research objectives. The crew also gather dice driven resources to build settlements for alternative scoring path. Come about and fire a cannon salvo on a poorly defended enemy with an away team. With considerable crew effort, terrain can be destroyed to terraform later or screw an opponents pattern. Love the re-roll drumsticks and the bonus worker action fish. Fun in so many ways BUT my wife can't load a dishwasher to save her life and trying to fit her pattern objectives to a constantly changing landscape of terrain tiles is a AP deal breaker for our table.

One could deem Shanghaien as a harmless little game. You just roll a couple of dice and assign one (according to the number rolled) to one of the cards on the table. Whoever has the most dice on a card claims it at the end of the round.
 
The trick is in the scoring. If you are the only player with cards in a certain colour, you score to the total value of the cards. If you only have the majority you score the total value of your opponent’s cards. This is supposed to make the game more interesting as the value of each individual battle can change significantly. I found it a bit annoying instead. In the early rounds it does not really matter which card you fight for, you only aim for the higher value ones and hope to roll well. In the late game, the tableau is usually filled with mostly junk with just a couple of game changing cards. At that point rolling well is even more important.
 
This is only marginally more interesting than roll and move. Decisions are straightforward and simple without any push your luck elements that (in my opinion) fit dice games very well.

RATING: 7
Here's an underrated and under appreciated 2 player game.  Even if dice are not your friend, this game finds a way to make it work in interesting ways.  There is skill required to second-guess your opponent and to work to control the card sets collected.  Errors in card collection will cost you the game if you don't play attention.  The dice definitely bring luck into the game, but the means by which you place them and the options to have ways to alter them mid-game ensures that even a string of 'bad rolls' really isn't bad.  Quick setup and fast play make this a great 2 player filler or afternoon / lunch hour break.

RATING: 7
A very simple game with quite a few interesting decisions to be made. True, the luck of the roll plays a large part, but it's not as large as it initially seems, due to the fact that you may apply some dirty tactics cards or even fight on another of the 9 different possible fronts.

Rating might improve with further plays.

UPDATE: Yes. The game is good. The luck effect is largely diminshed by using "dirty tricks", and there's this constant push/pull of wanting or despising certain cards at certain times. A game full of those agonizing decisions I do love. This is perhaps my favorite 2 player game ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice light dice game. Pirate theme but it's completely abstracted, any theme would do. 6 cards on the table each round, roll 2 dice, assign 1 to a card, each player does that until has only 1 die left or decides to finish the round earlier. Whoever has most dice in each card gets it. ties depend on adjacent dice. 2p only. Plays fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very enjoyable and refreshingly new.
It is overproduced though.  The meeples are completely unnecessary.
The game would have been perfectly fine with just the dice and cards.

Nothing fancy as a game (although I very much dig the dice's look). The box could be half the size. The game plays quite fast, is of course very luck prone but with some small mitigation through cards, has  very few choices to make based on tactics ('do I shanghai people now, before the end of the round or do I keep on going?) but in the end it's a very light dice game for 2. For what it is through, I wholeheartedly enjoy it.

2 player dice allocation game. Put out your dice to claim pirate cars of different colors. The twist is that the majority player scores for the value that the minority player has. So, you see red going for all the purple cards? Get a value 1 purple and he will score 1 point for his at the end of the game. Special cards add some craziness. Fairly light, fairly quick.

Actually remarkably playable for a 2 player game.   I tend to find the mechanics of too many 2 player games similar to that of chess.

7/5/08 - 36 hour trading extravaganza math trade - traded Animalia to get this. Similar mechanic to Roma - 6 cards are laid out between players, roll 2 dice - place one. When someone Shanghai's - cards are distributed to the player with the most dice placed on that card. Scoring is Knizia-like in that, player with the highest total for each color loses their cards and receives the other players cards for that color - this is their score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's OK, but far too luck dependent even for a dice game. Since you are limited to choosing only one die per roll, you have very little control over what to do with them, particularly toward the end of your turn. I like the scoring rules, which really makes you pay attention to the cards the other players are collecting, but ultimately choices become obvious and the game is usually decided by, not surprisingly, the roll of a die.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a fun and quick 2p game that has a few decisions to it.  I'd advise someone to stick with it when they first try it, the first few rounds seem fairly pointless, but the decisions soon become evident.

RATING: 8
Fun combination of rolling dice and trying to win sequences of cards.  The scoring is particularly devious: if you get all the cards of one color you will score a ton of points, but if your opponent gets just one of them you'll only get a pittance.  The random factor can be a pain sometimes, especially when it comes to breaking ties, but that is part of the fun.

Shanghaien is another proof for Michael Schacht's ability to develop one clever mechanism or twist and build a whole game around it. While this most often doesn't work for me with his big games, I do enjoy his small games immensely. A lot of them are impressive fillers that can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers at the same time. 

Shanghaien is no exception. While it's dice allocation mechanism reminds me of Battle Line and might not be that novel, the scoring mechanism is, at least in my opinion, what makes the game great. The whole game is filled with tough decisions and intense player interaction in a short playing time. Sure, there's also luck in Shangahaien and sometimes there will be nothing you can do, but there are ways to compensate the luck to a certain degree and hey, this is a 15 minutes game.

So, two thumbs up for this gem. Now I do only need to find a big Schacht game that I enjoy.

This is a fairly luck based game, but the mechanics introduce some unique twists that make it a fun playing experience.  I like the simple rules and the colorful dice and cards. Even though she won, my partner felt like there was not enough control over the outcome of the game.  But for something this short simple and unique, I don't mind that really.

2 player dice game - sounds interesting.

Update:
Got it, it's hard to rate this game on a 10 point scale. The game is definitely solid, there's a challenge some fun surprises and great comebacks. Yet it's a niche game. It's not varied enough to warrant a spot in a bag on a vacation. It's not deep enough to play at home with my entire game library available. Most of the time. It's definitely a keeper though!

Another dice game I bought because of my daughter-who-likes-dice-games.  I was pleasantly surprised by the strategy in this game because it isn't all luck as I had assumed.  Paying attention to your opponent's gangs and the game end scoring, remembering what is in the discard pile, using your dirty trick cards, and placing dice to break ties adds thought and "either this" /"or that" decisions to the game.

One of the more interesting 2-player dice game out there. Everything is in the scoring system, that will direct the duel on a few colors. One drawback: the selected colors are not colorblind-friendly at all! It would have been so easy to put a little symbol in the corner... (The left-handed/right-handed cards make no sense since you never hold them in your hand.)

A fairly simple dice game that is based on a single mechanism: allocating dice to cards according to the numbers rolled in order to gain majorities. The scoring rules have a nice twist that means you can severely impact your opponent's score but it also means that the one colour you didn't manage to score because of how the dice fell often makes the difference in final scoring.

Simple two player game with several nice ideas, like bidding with dice and a curious, though odd, scoring. The strongest crew of each color goes away and you score the opponent's crew instead.

Each card in the line corresponds to one of the faces in the die, but one of the players can pick from which side we start counting. There's also some luck mitigation on the "dirty trick" cards.

The theme is a bit problematic, at least how it's described in the rules. For some reason the crews are all stereotypes from different countries.

Oct08: A pretty darn good little 2-player game.  It has cards and dice galore!  So you know there will be luck and randomness.  And you really only get to choose between 2 things at a time, and yet the decisions seem important and you can affect the outcome.

I think the "Dirty Tricks" cards really make the game.  Without them, it would too often come down to the roll of the dice.  With the extra actions, the realm of possibilities open up just enough.

The scoring in this game is great: If you can collect all the cards in one color, say, 8 points worth, you'll get 8 points. But if your opponent collects any at all, say 2 points worth, you only score 2. This drives the push-your-luck decisions about whether to roll your dice (and where to place if you do) or call "shanghai" (ending the round). Neat game!

Simple, fun two player dice-driven set collection game. Some nice mechanics: unless one player can grab all the cards in a suit (and thus get full points for it), the person with the highest score in each suit scores the number of points the second player has accumulated in that suit. 

You need to know when to call time ('Shanghai') on a hand and when to press on. Block your opponent out of your strong suits completely to win.

Solid - and strategic - two-player dice game. Might be the best two-player dice game I've played. You basically roll two dice on a turn and pick one to place next to one of the six face-up cards that matches its position (1-6). On his turn, a player can call "Shangai" and end the round and divvy up the cards according to who has a majority of dice on that row. This happens eight times and then the player with the most points in a certain color scores points for that color. Some cards grant special, one-use abilities like re-rolling, adjusting the number rolled, placing both dice instead of one, or using it as a 2 value wild.

Every part of this game has a nifty rule to make the above description more interesting. Being able to control the end of a round allows you to take an early advantage to the bank. While having the most dice on a card allows you to win it, ties are broken by how many dice are on adjacent cards, adding another layer of consideration. The special abilities grant greater control over dice results. But the best part is the scoring: the player with the majority in a color scores the value of the minority player's cards. That means if I'm bulging with an 8 score in green while my opponent has a 1, I only score one point. If he has a 4 in yellow and I have a 3, he scores 3 for that color. At some point in the game, you need to decide in which colors you cannot compete and intentionally shoot for a low score, but something higher than zero. Great little game.

Nice little dice game that plays very quickly and is deeper than it initially appears.  Looks superficially like Roma, but plays so much more quickly, and seems more balanced.  Ridiculous pasted-on theme, but the quick play covers the lack of meaningful theme.  And it's fun to keep saying 'Shanghai' in a loud voice.

Egészen jópofa kis kétfős játék. Nagyon gyors, nincsenek elhúzódó gondolkodási, döntési helyzetek. Az alapötlet érdekes, de azért megmarad egy nagyon alapszintű set collection játéknak. A játék végi pontozás tetszik, de azért a kétfős absztrakt kategóriában nagyon sokan indulnak, és a Shanghaien nem az élmezőnybe tartozik.

Decent game combined with clever scoring mechanism = game worth playing.

Quick playing dice game for two players where you are basically competing for different set collections in each color.  The final scoring is a bit twisted in that you score the whole value of your set if your opponent doesn't have any cards of that color BUT if you beat your opponent in value for a set, you throw your cards away and score the value of your opponents cards.  Theoretically and perhaps ideally, you could have 1 point in green and your opponent has 12 but s/he would only score 1 point for green to your 0!

I know, I know.  How can I rate a short game a 10 with only two plays?  Well, because I just can tell.  This is a great game - like a light form of Roma.  The scoring makes it "gamey", and the way ties are decided forces some interesting decisions when placing dice.  I love it.  I think there are some free cards from Michael Schacht on the internet - I'll print them out and check them out.

UPDATE:  Other great things about this game...
-With 5 sailors in each nationality (suit) it is easy to keep track of how many sailors are left in the deck, without burning the brain.
-Learning to time the "Shanghai" is a key part of the game.

Our last game was tense.  I made a rush at suits she had more than 1 or 2 points in.  You could say I "diversified my portfolio".  She built up one big suit and also invested her wilds there.  She would quickly Shanghai when a sailor of this suit would come out, to keep me from getting one.  The final score was 16 to 18, Rachel winning.  14 of her points came from the Dutch sailors she'd kidnapped.  It was a gamble, but it paid off!

Les deux joueurs veulent se composer une forte équipe de pirates.
Pour ce faire, ils vont devoir essayer d'être majoritaire dans chacune des huit nationalités de pirates présentes dans la taverne où se déroule le recrutement.
Durant chaque manche,on présente 6 cartes de la pioche puis, à tour de rôle, les joueurs jettent deux dés et en choisissent un qu'ils mettent devant la carte correspondante.
Dès que deux dés sont placés par un joueur, et quand revient son tour il peut alors soit relancer deux dés (tant qu'il lui en reste au moins deux sur les 6 qu'il possède) soit décider de shanghaïer la manche (la terminer et procéder à l'attribution des cartes pirates)

I used to go gung-ho on the two-player gaming purchases but long ago my two-player gaming opportunities all but dried up (they are beginning to blossom again thanks to my daughter).  Unfortunately, most of the times I found the two-player games I purchased to be uninspiring and forgettable.  Such was the way I felt about this game, what with its typical card play/special powers mechanic and majority scoring at the end of each round.  Never chose it over other games in the collection to be played and will most likely never miss it.

RATING: 7
Very luck-based but very clever at the same time, Shanghaien pits two players who have to compete in eight rounds for six cards displayed in a row, each with a colour and a value. These cards can be won by throwing two dice, choosing one of them and placing it beside the card with the corresponding place within the row. After a player has placed two dice (six dice is the maximum amount) he/she can call off the round and each card will belong to the player who place more dice beside them.

As random as the gameplay might sound, the source of tension and tactics in the game is relatively unexpected: points are earned by cards of each colour and the winner scores only the real amount of points earned in one colour if the opponent has no cards in it; otherwise the score for the colour is the amount of points that the losing player has earned.

This little twist is what pretty much makes the game interesting. Players who get very far ahead in one colour must get all the remaining cards in it or otherwise the score will be surprisingly low; it certainly pays off more to keep colours relatively even and wait for the right chance to strike. Special colourless cards that appear during the game and can be won as the other cards can be used during the game to have more tools than the plain luck of the dice.

Why is this not better known? A pure, exciting and highly-involving 2P game, this is a terrific distillation of Lost Cities and Las Vegas along with a highly tactical player-determined endpoint. The luck mitigation is perhaps the most brilliant aspect: sure - the luck's not entirely mitigated, but the designer will make you think it is!

This is a nice little 2 player with a different feel. A little Roma-like. You're trying to claim all the cards in a colour or *just* win a colour. 6 cards are laid out in positions 1 thru 6. You roll two dice, and allocate one of your choice against the card in the position indicated by the die. Do this a few times, and then each person claims the cards they have most dice against. There's a few more rules, but that's the essence. A pleasant way to pass 20-30 minutes, but the constant die rolling means it won't get instant replay. It's more of an occasional game. Not a lot of depth, but pleasant.

I enjoy playing this game, and the battles can be tense.  But also, it's a dice game, and you have to accept that luck gets in the way of planning sometimes.

I play a lot of 2 player games, and this goes down very well.

Interesting 2 player dice game because you have to card count as you go through the deck once, capturing any of the 6 cards on display in order to monopolise or just have 1 point more in a colour in order to maximise score. A little bit fiddly to resolve as you compare colour values, discard and claim your opponent's cards otherwise one of the rare decent games using dice as a push your luck feature, and as only one roll is allowed generally plays quick.

The best think about this game are the cool (albeit fairly pointless) wooden captain pieces.  The second best thing about this game is that it is short.  Oddly, I felt this game needs more dice to enhance the strategic game play options.  Overall, it's not a bad game, but it's not particularly fun, there aren't a lot of meaningful choices, and the theme is totally pasted on.

Finally a game about pressganging! This is a nice little ditty that doesn't play out like every other dice game we've been subjected to since Yatzee and Can't Stop.  It is light fast and fun and doesn't overstay its welcome.  There are some choices to be made, but the reality is that the dice are either going to work for you or not.  Still it is entertaining.  My only objection with the game is that there needs to be a rule for rolling doubles (maybe make them wild?), as it isn't unlikely to happen and it means that there are less decisions to be made, which ultimately makes the game less interesting.  If I were to own the game I'd give everyone an extra white die that they can use once to roll after their normal roll as a supplement.

This is the game Lost Cities wants to be.  It's fast, light, filled with agonizing decisions, and involves enough luck to give a newbie a fighting chance.  What places it head and shoulders above Lost Cities is that when luck foils your best-laid plans, you still have options.  

Please please please won't someone publish an American edition?  And include the two already existing expansion cards (as well as a few blanks) -- more dirty tricks sounds fun.  Don't know if the "wife game" niche would argue for re-theming.  How do non-gaming spouses feel about pirates?

Pretty cool 2-player dice set-collection game. There's a line of 6 cards between players (x 6 rounds?), with cards in one of 5 (or 6?) suits and differing values. Roll 2d6 and allocate at least one of them; alternate till someone decides to Shanghai (end the round): players take the cards on which they've allocated more dice, with ties being decided by sum of adjacent dice. Some cards ("Dirty Tricks") give you special powers. At the end, score for each color; VP goes to player with higher sum of cards = sum other player's cards (unless you got them all; then you score everything). Most VP wins.

Or something like that.

It's fast and pretty fun, with some interesting choices to make along the way about how to allocate your dice, and which colors to go for.

The scoring works rather unusual and is therefor interesting (you get either the value of your color crew or the value of your opponent's crew if he has any of that color), so is the dice placing when with equal dice competing for a card it matters what dice were placed on neighbor cards. Those are little tweaks but they make for a real interesting game. I have the perfect ability to always lose this game by one or two  points, still enjoy it though.

Another run-of-the mill simple game by Michael Schacht. He's made better, he's made worse. It's fairly short and dice rolling is almost always fun, so I don't really object to playing this. But it really isn't worth owning.

Tried it once. Haven't finished a play. I understand that this is based on simple, yet smart idea, but I'm not getting this game at all. Overproduced components aren't making things any better.

[Abacus 08 edition] {China, couple; dice-rolling, set collection}  Shanghaien is a light-weight dice game for 2 players (similar to 'Cosmic Cows').  It is easy to teach and learn.  A typical game runs around 30 minutes.  The theme is pasted on.  There are tactical options but luck is still important.  In all, it is fun and interactive.  I quite like it.

The components are ok.  The illustration is funny but the color code is not very color-blind friendly.  I wish there were bigger dice.

This is a great little dice rolling game for 2 people.  It's like a worker placement game with variable workers.  The scoring mechanic is awesome.

Traded in October 2010 for Days of Steam.

Good, short game for two players. It's simple and does not require much thinking (however there is a place for a little strategy) though it requires a little luck when it comes to throw the dices.

Petit filler qui permet de lancer beaucoup de dés pour le fun. Qui dit dés, dit aussi hasard mais il est tout de même assez contrôlable. La stratégie est limité, mais intéressante considérant la durée.

Cute little two-player dice game that moves along pretty quickly. While players do have some decisions to make, I'm not sure there's enough going on here to stand up to repeated plays. I like the mechanic that the player with the most points in one color (nationality) receives the cards of the other person as points, throwing their own cards away. Most of what's interesting in Shangaien is a result of this little scoring twist. Update: Game did not hold our interest during repeated plays. It ain't bad, but it turned out not to be a keeper, either.

2-player dice game. I am either very bad at this game or I have very bad luck. I have lost all but 1 game played so far. Neat little mechanics that make the game a little deeper than it would first appear.

RATING: 8
An outstanding 2 player game.  Games are very dynamic for a title that is this simple.  Roll your dice, place one, or shanghai and end the round.  That's it.  The catch is that you can easily force the game to change for your opponents, or vice versa.  Not for those who get tunnel vision when playing games.  

Recommended, and it is a shame that this did not get a domestic release.  

Update:  Ten plays in, and this has rapidly become a favorite 2 player game--easily beating Lost Cities.  Can't say enough good things about it--fast, simple, and very well designed.  The key to playing well is having several of the "1" value cards.

This is  a unique two player game with a Knizia-like scoring system. 

Shanghaien is a dice based game,  in which you are assigning them to a tableau of different colored cards,  attempting to earn majorities.  This is a simplified description - there are many nuances and twists to the actual game play.  Not to imply that it is not a simple game - it is - but it offers a lot of choices along the way.

If you game with two,  I highly recommend this effort,  as it will,  most likely,  be a bit different from what you have seen before.  If you are looking for a deep experience however,  you will not find it here.

I've clearly accumulated more light 2 player games than my gaming schedule can handle because this is still unplayed after well over a year.  It looks somewhat interesting, but not enough to recommend it over tried and true 2 player games in the same niche.

I have since traded it away.

Very few decisions to make (generally you have just two options on your turn, and sometimes just one). I'd rate it even lower if it were longer.

RATING: 8
The best "pure dice" filler game for two players I know. Like Kingsburg, it is a game in which the dice are thrown many times, but victory is still possible if you roll badly. Easier to learn than Roma (which I also like), but offers a sufficient amount of tactical decisions and screwage for such a short game (about 30 minutes). Different enough from Roma (less special actions, more set collection) to warrant owning both. The 8+ age rating might be a bit optimistic considering the subtleties of scoring.

Schacht, just buy all of his games...........simple mechanics that are the definition of elegant.  Shanghaien has 8 rounds that require each person to pay close attention to each other's inventory....make clever decisions......think about timing......and manage the luck of the dice.  I love this game. quick game...2 player....homeade garden version and original......wife love's it.

our think our game (wife and I) might be this now, rather than Medici.......

A quick game of rolling dice and placing them to collect the best sets of characters for your side.  The point scoring makes it interesting where if you have the higher points for a shared set you get the points from the opponent's lower values.  Quick and simple with some interesting choices on where to place your dice to either compete for a card or not.

Years after my first experience i come back to this game and i don't find it that bad at all, even if it lacks in depth. The decisions you take aren't many and aren't agonizing but you can try to be mean with your opponent and the results are quite fun. I dont feel the need of playing or buying it but i can play it as it is quite fast

This dice tug-of-war pulls out a minor win, based primarily on its spiffy tiebreaking system and novel-ish scoring.  Plays supersonically fast, too.

Excellent game for two with a few nice twists, mostly in the way scoring is handled. Hints of set collection, push-your-luck, and special powers. Very light.
